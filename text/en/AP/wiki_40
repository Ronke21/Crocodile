<text>High Speed 1 (HS1), officially the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), is a high-speed railway linking London with the Channel Tunnel.

It is part of the line carrying international passenger traffic between the United Kingdom and mainland Europe; it also carries domestic passenger traffic to and from stations in Kent and east London, and continental European loading gauge freight traffic. From the Channel Tunnel, the line crosses the River Medway, and tunnels under the River Thames, terminating at London St Pancras International station on the north side of central London. It cost £6.84 billion to build and opened on 14 November 2007. Trains run at speeds of up to on HS1. Intermediate stations are at in London, Ebbsfleet International in northern Kent and Ashford International in southern Kent.

International passenger services are provided by Eurostar International, with journey times from London St Pancras International to Paris Gare du Nord in 2hours 15minutes, and London St Pancras International to Brussels South/Bruxelles-Midi/Brussel Zuid in 1hour and 51minutes. 
, Eurostar uses a fleet of 27 Class 373/1 multi-system trains capable of and Class 374 trains. Domestic high-speed commuter services serving the intermediate stations and beyond began on 13 December 2009. The fleet of 29 Class 395 passenger trains reach speeds of . DB Cargo UK run freight services on High Speed 1 using adapted Class 92 locomotives, enabling flat wagons carrying continental-size swap body containers to reach London for the first time.

The CTRL project saw new bridges and tunnels built, with a combined length nearly as long as the Channel Tunnel itself, and significant archaeological research undertaken. In 2002, the CTRL project was awarded the Major Project Award at the British Construction Industry Awards. The line was transferred to government ownership in 2009, with a 30-year concession for its operation awarded to a consortium of Borealis Infrastructure (part of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System) and Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan in November 2010.

== Early history ==

A high-speed rail line, LGV Nord, has been in operation between the Channel Tunnel and the outskirts of Paris since the Tunnel&#x27;s opening in 1994. This has enabled Eurostar rail services to travel at 300 km/h (186 mph) for this part of their journey. A similar high-speed line in Belgium, from the French border to Brussels, HSL 1, opened in 1997. In Britain, Eurostar trains had to run at a maximum of on existing tracks between London Waterloo International and the Channel Tunnel. These tracks were shared with local traffic, limiting the number of services that could be run, and jeopardising reliability. The case for a high-speed line similar to the continental part of the route was recognised by policymakers, and the construction of the line was authorised by Parliament with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996, which was amended by the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (Supplementary Provisions) Act 2008.

An early plan conceived by British Rail in the early 1970s for a route passing through Tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds, especially from the Leigh Action Group and Surrey &amp; Kent Action on Rail (SKAR). A committee was set up to examine the proposal under Sir Alexander Cairncross; but in due course environment minister Anthony Crosland announced that the project had been cancelled, together with the plan for the tunnel itself.

The next plan for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link involved a tunnel reaching London from the south-east, and an underground terminus in the vicinity of London King&#x27;s Cross station. A late change in the plans, principally driven by Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine&#x27;s desire for urban regeneration in East London, led to a change of route, with the new line approaching London from the east. This opened the possibility of reusing the underused St Pancras railway station as the terminus, with access via the North London Line that crosses the throat of the station.

The idea of using the North London line proved illusory, and it was rejected in 1994 by the then Transport Secretary, John MacGregor, as too difficult to construct and environmentally damaging. The idea of using St Pancras station as the core of the new terminus was retained, albeit now linked by of specially built tunnels to Dagenham via Stratford.

London &amp; Continental Railways (LCR) was chosen by the UK government in 1996 to build the line and to reconstruct St Pancras station as its terminus, and to take over the British share of the Eurostar operation, Eurostar (UK). The original LCR consortium members were National Express, Virgin Group, SG Warburg &amp; Co, Bechtel and London Electric. While the project was under development by British Rail it was managed by &quot;Union Railways&quot;, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of &quot;LCR&quot;. On 14 November 2006, LCR adopted &quot;High Speed 1&quot; as the brand name for the completed railway. Official legislation, documentation and line-side signage have continued to refer to &quot;CTRL&quot;.

== Project ==
As the Channel Tunnel Act 1987 made government funding for a Channel Tunnel rail link unlawful, construction did not take place, as it was not financially viable. Construction was delayed until the passage of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996, which provided construction powers that would run for ten years. The chief executive, Rob Holden, stated that it was the &quot;largest land acquisition programme since the Second World War&quot;.

The whole route was to have been built as a single project, but in 1998, serious financial difficulties arose, and extensive changes came with a British government rescue plan. To reduce risk, the line was split into two separate phases, to be managed by &quot;Union Railways (South)&quot; and &quot;Union Railways (North)&quot;. A recovery programme was agreed whereby LCR sold government-backed bonds worth £1.6 billion to pay for the construction of section 1, with the future of section 2 still not settled.

The original intention had been for the new railway, once completed, to be run by Union Railways as a separate line from the rest of the British railway network. As part of the 1998 rescue it was agreed that following completion, section 1 would be purchased by Railtrack with an option to purchase section 2. In return, Railtrack was committed to operate the whole route as well as London St Pancras International, which, unlike all other former British Rail stations, had been transferred to LCR/Union Railways in 1996.

In 2001, Railtrack announced that because of its own financial problems, it would not undertake to purchase section 2, triggering a second restructuring. The 2002 plan agreed that the two sections would have different owners (Railtrack for section 1, LCR for section 2) but with common Railtrack management. Following further financial problems at Railtrack, its interest was sold back to LCR, which then sold the operating rights for the completed line to Network Rail, Railtrack&#x27;s successor. Under this arrangement LCR became the sole owner of both sections of the CTRL and the St Pancras property, as per the original 1996 plan. Amendments were made in 2001 for the new station at Stratford International and connections to the West Coast Main Line.

As a consequence of the restructuring, the LCR consortium in 2001 consisted of engineering consultants and construction firms Arup, Bechtel, Halcrow and Systra (which form &quot;Rail Link Engineering&quot; (RLE)); transport operators National Express and SNCF (which operates the &quot;Eurostar (UK)&quot; share of the Eurostar service with the National Railway Company of Belgium and British Airways), the electricity company EDF and UBS.

There were several deaths of employees working on the CTRL over the construction period. One occurred on 28 March 2003 near Folkestone when a worker came into contact with the energised power supply. Another death occurred two months later, in May 2003, when a scaffolder fell seven metres at Thurrock, Essex. Three companies were found guilty of breaching health and safety legislation by omitting to provide barriers, resulting in Deverson Direct Ltd. being ordered to pay a fine of £50,000, J.Murphy &amp; Sons Ltd. £25,000, and Hochtief AG £25,000. Two more deaths resulted from a fire on board a train carrying wires, one mile () inside a tunnel under the Thames between Swanscombe, Kent, and Thurrock, Essex on 16 August 2005. The train shunter died at the scene and the train driver later died in hospital. It has been suggested that a large amount of blame for accidents throughout the project lay with individual behaviour, becoming such a problem that an internal programme was launched to tackle problem behaviour during the construction.

On completion of section 1 by RLE, the line was handed over to Union Railways (South), which then handed it over to &quot;London &amp; Continental Stations and Property&quot; (LCSP), the line&#x27;s long-term owners. Once section 2 of the line had been completed, it was handed over to Union Railways (North), which handed it over to LCSP. The entire line, including St Pancras, is managed, operated and maintained by Network Rail (CTRL).

In February 2006, there were rumours that a &#x27;third party&#x27; (believed to be a consortium headed by banker Sir Adrian Montague) had expressed an interest in buying out the present partners in the project. LCR shareholders rejected the proposal, and the government, which could effectively overrule shareholders&#x27; decisions as a result of LCR&#x27;s reclassification as a state-owned body, decided that discussions with shareholders would not take place imminently, which effectively backed shareholders&#x27; views on the proposed takeover.

By May 2009, LCR had become insolvent, and the government received an agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and to open it up to competition to allow other services to use it apart from Eurostar. LCR&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary, HS1 Ltd, thus became the property of the Secretary of State for Transport. On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £16 billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt. The government announced on 5 November 2010 that a concession to operate the line for thirty years had been sold for £2.1 billion to a consortium of Canadian investors. Under the concession, HS1 Ltd has the rights to sell access to track and to the four international stations (St Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford) on a commercial basis, under the scrutiny of the Office of Rail &amp; Road. At the end of thirty years, ownership of the assets will revert to the government.

== Building cost ==
The cost of construction was £6.84 billion. At £51 million per mile, this was higher than other projects in many other countries. The French LGV Est, a line built largely through near-flat fields (save for the Saverne Tunnel) and which terminates outside its urban centres (Vaires-sur-Marne for Paris and Vendenheim for Strasbourg) cost £22 million per mile. Its phase one was completed in 2007 and phase two in 2016.

== Route ==


The high-speed railway operates as a &quot;seven-day railway&quot;, with full availability on all days. Heavy maintenance is performed overnight. 
, track access charges were capped at approximately £71.35 per minute. In 2008, the cost of running a train along the full length of the line between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel was £2,244; with lower costs of £2,192 for a domestic service to Ashford International, or £1,044 for St Pancras to Ebbsfleet International. A discounted rate of £4.00 per kilometre was made available for night-time-only railfreight operation until 31 March 2015.

=== Section 1 ===
&quot;Section 1&quot; of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, opened on 28 September 2003, is a section of high-speed track from the Channel Tunnel to Fawkham Junction in north Kent with a maximum speed of . Its completion cut the London–Paris journey time by around 21minutes, to 2hours 35minutes. The line includes the Medway Viaduct, a bridge over the River Medway, and the North Downs Tunnel, a long, diameter tunnel. In safety testing on the section prior to opening, a new UK rail speed record of was set. Much of the new line runs alongside the M2 and M20 motorways through Kent. After its completion, Eurostar trains continued to use suburban lines to enter London, arriving at Waterloo International.

Unlike most LGV stations in France, the through tracks for Ashford International station are off to one side rather than going through, partly because the station pre-dates the line. High Speed 1 approaches Ashford International from the north in a cut-and-cover &quot;box&quot;; the southbound line rises out of this cutting and crosses over the main tracks to enter the station. The main tracks then rise out of the cutting and over a flyover. On leaving Ashford, southbound Eurostars return to the high-speed line by travelling under this flyover and joining from the outside. The international platforms at Ashford are supplied with both overhead 25kVAC and third-rail 750VDC power, avoiding the need to switch power supplies. Within Ashford, the speed limit on High Speed 1 is .

=== Section 2 ===
&quot;Section 2&quot; of the project opened on 14 November 2007, and is a stretch of track from the newly built Ebbsfleet station in Kent to London St Pancras. Completion of the section cut journey times by a further 20minutes (London–Paris in 2hours 15minutes; London–Brussels in 1hour 51minutes). The route starts with a tunnel which dives under the Thames on the edge of Swanscombe, then runs alongside the London, Tilbury and Southend line as far as Dagenham, where it enters two long tunnels to reach St Pancras. The two tunnels (much of which is directly under the North London Line) are and the in length, split by a stretch that runs close to the surface to serve Stratford International and the Temple Mills Depot. The new depot, to the north of Stratford, replaced the North Pole depot in the west of London. In testing, the first Eurostar train ran into St Pancras on 6 March 2007. All CTRL connections are fully grade-separated.

== Stations ==

=== Ashford International ===
This station was rebuilt as Ashford International during the early 1990s for international services from mainland Europe; this included the addition of two platforms to the north of station (the original down island platform had been taken over by international services). Unlike normal LGV stations in France, the through tracks for Ashford International railway station are off to one side rather than going through. The number of services was reduced after the opening of the Ebbsfleet station. A high-speed domestic service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009. Eurostar has not served the station since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and services will not return until at least 2025.

=== Ebbsfleet International ===
Ebbsfleet International railway station in the borough of Dartford, Kent is outside the eastern boundary of Greater London and opened to the public on 19 November 2007. It became Eurostar&#x27;s main station in Kent. Two of the platforms are designed for international passenger trains and four for high-speed domestic services. A high-speed domestic service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009. Eurostar has not served the station since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and services will not return until at least 2025.

=== St Pancras International ===


The terminus for the high-speed line in London is St Pancras railway station. During the 2000s, towards the end of the construction of the CTRL, the entire station complex was renovated, expanded and renamed as St Pancras International, with a new security-sealed terminal area for Eurostar trains to continental Europe. In addition, it retained traditional domestic connections to the north and south of England. The new extension doubled the length of the central platforms now used for Eurostar services; new platforms have been provided for existing domestic East Midlands Trains and the Southeastern high-speed services that run along High Speed 1 to Kent. New platforms on the Thameslink line across London were built beneath the western margins of the station, and the station at King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink was closed.

A complex junction has been built north of St Pancras with connections to the East Coast Main Line, North London Line (for West Coast Main Line) and Midland Main Line, allowing for a wide variety of potential destinations albeit on conventional rails. As part of the works, tunnels connecting the East Coast Main Line to the Thameslink route were also built in readiness for the forthcoming Thameslink Programme.

=== Stratford International ===
Stratford International railway station was not part of the original government plans for the CTRL. Despite its name, no international services have ever called there.
Completed in April 2006, it opened on 30 November 2009 when the domestic preview Southeastern highspeed services started calling there. An extension of the Docklands Light Railway opened to Stratford International in August 2011. It forms part of the complex of railway stations for the main site where the 2012 Summer Olympics were held.

Temple Mills Depot in Leyton is used for storage and servicing of Eurostar trains and off-peak berthing of Class 395 Southeastern high-speed trains.

== Infrastructure ==

The railway is maintained from Singlewell Infrastructure Maintenance Depot.

The construction work of the line was complex, and many contractors were involved in delivering them. The CTRL Section 2 construction works had caused considerable disruption around the Kings Cross area of London; in their wake redevelopment was stimulated. The large redevelopment area includes the run-down areas of post-industrial and ex-railway land close to King&#x27;s Cross and St Pancras, a conservation area with many listed buildings; this was promoted as one of the benefits for building the CTRL. It has been postulated that this development was actually suppressed by the construction project, and some affected districts were said still to be in a poor state in 2005.

=== Track ===
Both track and signalling technology (TVM-430 + KVB) are based on or identical to the standards used on the French LGV high-speed lines. The areas around St Pancras and Gare du Nord use colour light and KVB signalling with the whole of the high-speed route to Paris (CTRL, Channel Tunnel, LGV Nord) using TVM-430. Traffic between London and the Channel Tunnel is controlled from the Ashford signalling centre. Signalling tests before opening were performed by the SNCF-owned &quot;Lucie&quot; test car.

The track is cleared to a larger modern European GC loading gauge enabling GC gauge freight as far as the yards at Barking. The line is electrified entirely using overhead lines with 25 kV AC railway electrification.

=== Tunnels ===
After local protests, early plans were modified to put more of the route into tunnels up until a point approximately from St Pancras. Previously the CTRL was planned to run on an elevated section alongside the North London Line on approach into the line&#x27;s terminus. The twin tunnels bored under London were driven from Stratford westwards towards St Pancras, eastwards towards Dagenham and from Dagenham westwards to connect with the tunnel from Stratford. The tunnel boring machines were long and weighed . The depth of the tunnels varies from . The two London tunnels are and in length, split by Stratford International station.

Other major tunnels along the route include a tunnel underneath the River Thames at Thurrock in Essex and the North Downs Tunnel near Maidstone in Kent.

=== Viaducts ===
Several major viaducts are present on the route, with three viaducts over in length. The Medway Viaduct takes the line over the River Medway adjacent to the M2 motorway, the Thurrock Viaduct takes the line under the A282 Dartford Crossing and the Ashford Viaduct takes the fast lines over Ashford International station.

=== Connection line to Waterloo ===
A connecting line providing access for Waterloo International leaves High Speed 1 at Southfleet Junction using a grade-separated junction; the main CTRL tracks continue uninterrupted through to CTRL Section 2 underneath the southbound flyover. The connection joins the Chatham Main Line at Fawkham Junction with a flat crossing. The retention of Eurostar services to Waterloo after the line to St Pancras opened was ruled out on cost grounds. Waterloo International closed upon opening of the section two of the CTRL in November 2007; Eurostar now serves the refurbished St Pancras as its only London terminal, so this connecting line is no longer used in regular service, but can be used by Class 395 passenger trains.

== Services ==
International passenger services on this line are operated by Eurostar, with maximum speed , while domestic passenger services are operated by Southeastern as far as Ashford International, with maximum speed .

High Speed 1 was built to allow eight trains per hour through to the Channel Tunnel. As of May 2014, Eurostar runs two to three trains per hour in each direction between London and the Channel Tunnel. Southeastern runs in the high peak eight trains per hour between London and Ebbsfleet, two of these continuing to Ashford. During the 2012 Olympic Games, Southeastern provided the Olympic Javelin service with up to twelve trains per hour from Stratford into London.

=== Freight ===
The route was built with freight provision from the beginning. It has spurs leading to and from the freight terminal at Dollands Moor (Folkestone) and the freight depot at Barking (Ripple Lane), north of the River Thames. Long passing loops to hold freight trains while passenger trains overtake them were built at Lenham Heath and Singlewell.

Freight trains operated by EWS first ran over CTRL Section 1, on the consecutive evenings of 3–4 April 2004. Five freight trains that would have run via the classic lines were diverted to run over the Channel Tunnel Rail Link instead: three southbound intermodal trains on 3 April 2004 and two northbound intermodal trains on 4 April 2004.

== Ownership ==
In November 2010, the HS1 concession was awarded for a duration of thirty years to an investment consortium bringing together two Canadian public pension funds: Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (through its subsidiary Borealis Infrastructure), and Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan for £2.1 billion.
At the time, UK pension investors had generally limited interest in such long-term, illiquid, &#x27;infrastructure assets&#x27;.

In 2017, the sale of the 30 year HS1 concession was announced to funds advised and managed by InfraRed Capital Partners and Equitix Investment Management; participants include HICL Infrastructure (35%), Equitix (35%) and South Korea&#x27;s National Pension Service (30%), for an enterprise value of £3 billion.

The private operator does not hold the freehold or rights to any of the associated land.

== Operators ==

The railway is operated on an open access basis. Trains are operated by several organisations all operating over the same track. HS1 Ltd. is the network manager for the line, stations, and other infrastructure. Since February 2025, HS1 Ltd. has traded as London St. Pancras Highspeed, which it suggests would reflect a more consumer-facing role whilst looking at options to expand capacity at London St Pancras International railway station.

=== Network Rail (High Speed) Ltd ===

HS1 Ltd is responsible for overall managing and running of the line – along with the international railway stations at St Pancras, Stratford, Ashford and Ebbsfleet – with responsibility for the infrastructure itself sub-contracted to Network Rail (High Speed) Ltd (formerly known as Network Rail (CTRL) acting as the controller and infrastructure manager. Network Rail (CTRL) Limited was created as a subsidiary of Network Rail on 26 September 2003 for £57 million to take over the assets of the CTRL renewal and maintenance operations. Network Rail (High Speed) operates engineering, track maintenance machines, rescue locomotives, and infrastructure- and test trains. Eurotunnel&#x27;s subsidiary Europorte 2 operates its Eurotunnel Class 0001 (Krupp/MaK 6400) rescue locomotives on the line when required.

Various track recording trains run as necessary, including visits by the New Measurement Train. On the night of 4/5 May 2011 the SNCF TGV Iris 320 laboratory train took over, being hauled from Coquelles to St Pancras and back, towed by Eurotunnel Krupp locomotives numbers 4 and 5. The Iris 320 runs for Network Rail (High Speed) are an extension of the monitoring cycle already undertaken by SNCF International since December 2010 for Eurotunnel every two months.

=== Eurostar ===

The Eurostar service uses about 40% of the capacity of High Speed 1, which in November 2007 became the company&#x27;s route for all its services prior to the merger with Thalys. Eurostar trains are for international traffic only, passing along the high-speed line from London St Pancras railway station to the Channel Tunnel, with the majority terminating at either Paris Gare du Nord in France or Brussels-South railway station in Belgium. A Eurostar train was used to set a new British rail speed record of on 30 July 2003. Prior to the formation of Eurostar International Limited, the British component of the Eurostar grouping was owned by London &amp; Continental Railways, which had also previously owned the High Speed 1 infrastructure.

The fastest regular-service Eurostar journeys on record are 2 hours, 3 minutes and 39 seconds from Paris Gare du Nord to St Pancras, set on 4 September 2007; and 1 hour 43 minutes from Brussels South to St Pancras, set on 19 September 2007.

=== Southeastern ===

Domestic high-speed services on High Speed 1 are operated by Southeastern. Having been in planning since 2004, a preview service of the British Rail Class 395 trains, popularly known as &quot;Javelins&quot;, started in June 2009, and regular services began on 13 December 2009. The quickest journey time from Ashford to London St Pancras is 35 minutes, compared with 80 minutes for the service to London Charing Cross via Tonbridge. This service on Section 2 of the CTRL, known previously as CTRL-DS, was a factor in London&#x27;s successful 2012 Olympic Bid, promising a seven-minute journey time from the Olympic Park at Stratford to the London terminus at St Pancras.
=== DB Cargo UK ===

DB Cargo is a global freight operator with a large interest in freight over rail in Europe. While High Speed 1 was constructed with freight loops, no freight traffic had run upon the line since opening in 2003. On 16 April 2009 DB Schenker signed an agreement with HS1 Ltd, the owner of High Speed 1, for a partnership to develop TVM modifications for class 92 freight locomotives to run on the line. On 25 March 2011 for the first time a modified class 92 locomotive travelled from Dollands Moor to Singlewell using the TVM430 signalling system. A loaded container train ran for the first time on 27 May 2011, to Novara in Italy. Following further trials with loaded wagons DB is to upgrade five Class 92 locomotives to allow them to run on High Speed 1. From 11 November 2011 a weekly service using European-sized swap body containers has run between London and Poland using High Speed 1.

=== Future operations ===
==== Deutsche Bahn ====

In November 2007, it was reported that DB, Germany&#x27;s national train company, had applied to use the Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1 into London. This was denied by Deutsche Bahn, and the bi-national Channel Tunnel Safety Authority confirmed that it had not received such an application. The plan was delayed by safety regulations as Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s fleet of ICE 3M high-speed trains could not be divided in the tunnel in an emergency.

In December 2008, it was reported that DB was interested in buying the British share in Eurostar, which in practice meant buying Eurostar (UK) Ltd., the 100% subsidiary of London &amp; Continental Railways (LCR), which the British government intended to break up and sell just as it did the other rail-related subsidiary of L&amp;CR, HS1 Ltd. The buyer of EUKL would become the owner of the 11 British &quot;Three Capitals&quot; Class 373 trainsets plus all seven &quot;North of London&quot; sets, and would also be responsible for the operations of Eurostar traffic within Britain once the management contract with ICRR expires in 2010. Guillaume Pépy, the president of SNCF, who held a press conference the same day, described DB&#x27;s interest as &quot;premature, presumptuous and arrogant&quot;.
SNCF claims to own 62% of the shares of Eurostar Group Ltd. Hartmut Mehdorn, then CEO of Deutsche Bahn, confirmed DB&#x27;s interest but insisted in a letter to Pépy that DB had only informally requested information and not made any official requests to Britain&#x27;s Department for Transport.

In 2009, Eurotunnel (the owners of the Channel Tunnel) announced that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations, in order to permit other operators, such as Deutsche Bahn, to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock. Under the deregulation of European railway service, high-speed lines were opened up to access by other operators on 1 January 2010; the Inter-Governmental Commission on the Channel Tunnel (IGC) announced that it was considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting. LCR suggested that high-speed rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics.

In March 2010, Eurotunnel, HS1 Ltd, DB and other interested train operators formed a working group to discuss changes to the safety rules, including allowing 200-metre trains. The Intergovernmental Commission currently requires trains to be 400 m long. Deutsche Bahn carried out evacuation trials in the tunnel on 17 October 2010 with two 200m-long ICE3 trains, and displayed one of them at St Pancras station on 19 October. The current Velaro ICE3 sets do not meet the fire safety requirements for passenger services through the tunnel, but the Siemens Velaro D sets on order include the necessary additional fire-proofing. In March 2011, the European Rail Agency decided to allow trains with distributed traction to operate in the Channel Tunnel. DB is planning three services a day to Frankfurt (5h from London), Rotterdam (3h) and Amsterdam (4h) via Brussels from 2015. This had originally planned to be 2013, but has been delayed due to the availability of the Channel Tunnel version of the Siemens Velaro D trains, high rental costs of the French rail network and border controls in their stations. As of 2016, nothing yet has come to fruition, but the High Speed One website continues to state that &quot;HS1 Ltd are working with Deutsche Bahn on plans to incorporate three additional international return journeys, between Frankfurt and London via Cologne, Brussels and Lille. This will include connections from Amsterdam via Rotterdam to London.&quot;

In March 2017, it was announced that Deutsche Bahn had revived plans for a London to Frankfurt train service with the service beginning as early as 2020. The service would take around five hours and could rival airlines and become the first competitor for Eurostar. In June 2018, Deutsche Bahn stated the plans have been shelved due to a &quot;significantly changed economic environment&quot;.

In January 2024, DB remarked &quot;transport between London and the mainland through the Eurotunnel remains of fundamental interest to Deutsche Bahn&quot;, though noting that the routes and trains were not yet equipped with end-to-end ETCS.

==== Veolia ====
In 2009, Veolia Transport (now defunct and merged into Transdev) planned to work on proposals in co-operation with Trenitalia to run services from Paris to Strasbourg, London and Brussels.

==== Services to Bordeaux ====
It was revealed in March 2020 that High Speed 1 Ltd, along with SNCF and Lisea, were looking for an operator for a future London St PancrasBordeaux St Jean train service.

==== Renfe ====

The Spanish railway operator said in 2009 that it was interested in running AVE services from Spain to London via Paris, Lyon, Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon (using the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line) once its AVE network was connected to France via the Barcelona to Figueres and Perpignan to Figueres lines in 2012.

In October 2021, Renfe announced that it intends to operate high-speed trains between Paris and London using the Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1. A Renfe spokesperson has said that there are possible options available on the high-speed route for additional trains to operate. “According to the demand analyses carried out, it would be viable and profitable for Renfe to compete with Eurostar.” The rail company claims it had already received support from Getlink – the European company that operates the Channel tunnel – and from HS1, which owns, runs and maintains the 109km rail line between the Channel tunnel and London.

==== Getlink ====
In August 2018, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; reported that Getlink is interested in setting up an Ouigo-style low cost high speed rail service between London and Paris, travelling between the railway stations of Stratford International and Charles-de-Gaulle.

In December 2023, it announced it would to double the market for direct high speed trains from the UK over the next 10 years. It aimed to reduce the time to market from 10 to 5 years, with services considered including from London to Cologne, Frankfurt, Geneva and Zurich. This would be done through market research, standardising tunnel regulations, introducing tunnel specific criteria into standard rolling stock designs, and working with network operators and stations.

==== Heuro ====
In November 2023, the Dutch rail start up, Heuro, led by Maarten van den Biggelaar, a Dutch entrepreneur, and his son, planned to offer 16 services per day from Amsterdam to both London and Paris. It is looking to raise €600 million for the service. It plans to use Zefiro V300 trains, similar to the Frecciarossa 1000.

==== Evolyn ====
Evolyn, led by the Cosmen family of Spain (the largest shareholder in Mobico) and backed by British and French partners, planned to start non-stop services between London and Paris by 2025. Corporate filings by Eurostar take the opinion of 2028 being a more likely market entry date, likely due to the increased regulatory challenges following Brexit.

Evolyn is looking to order 12 trains from Alstom, depending on securing project financing and regulatory approval.

==== Virgin Group ====
As of 2024, the Virgin Group was in the process of exploring whether high speed cross-Channel services would be feasible. Under the name &quot;Project Bullet&quot;, it is gauging interest with investors for a £200 million equity raise. It is also looking to finance 12 trains, shortlisting two suppliers, for the service planned between London, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels from 2028.

Virgin and Evolyn remarked in November 2024 at an industry event in the Houses of Parliament, that Eurostar had not agreed access to Temple Mills depot. The companies have appealed to the ORR to assess the available capacity

<text>Chartres () is the prefecture of the Eure-et-Loir department in the Centre-Val de Loire region in France. It is located about southwest of Paris. At the 2019 census, there were 170,763 inhabitants in the metropolitan area of Chartres (as defined by the INSEE), 38,534 of whom lived in the city (commune) of Chartres proper.

Chartres is famous worldwide for its cathedral. Mostly constructed between 1193 and 1250, this Gothic cathedral is in an exceptional state of preservation. The majority of the original stained glass windows survive intact, while the architecture has seen only minor changes since the early 13th century. Part of the old town, including most of the library associated with the School of Chartres, was destroyed by Allied bombs in 1944.

==History==
Chartres was one of the principal towns in Gaul of the Carnutes, a Celtic tribe. In the Gallo-Roman period, it was called &quot;Autricum&quot;, name derived from the river &quot;Autura&quot; (Eure), and afterwards &quot;civitas Carnutum&quot;, &quot;city of the Carnutes&quot;, from which Chartres got its name. The city was raided and burned down by the Norsemen in 858, and once again besieged, this time unsuccessfully, by them in 911.

During the Middle Ages, it was the most important town of the Beauce. It gave its name to a county which was held by the counts of Blois, and the counts of Champagne, and afterwards by the House of Châtillon, a member of which sold it to the Crown in 1286.

In 1417, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Chartres fell into the hands of the English, from whom it was recovered in 1432. In 1528, it was raised to the rank of a duchy by Francis I.

In 1568, during the second war of Religion, Chartres was unsuccessfully besieged by the Huguenot leader, the Prince of Condé. It was finally taken by the royal troops of Henry IV on 19 April 1591. On Sunday, 27 February 1594, the cathedral of Chartres was the site of the coronation of Henry IV after he converted to the Catholic faith, the only king of France whose coronation ceremony was not performed in Reims.

In 1674, Louis XIV raised Chartres from a duchy to a duchy peerage in favor of his nephew, Duke Philippe II of Orléans. The title of Duke of Chartres was hereditary in the House of Orléans, and given to the eldest son of the Duke of Orléans.

During the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War, Chartres was seized by the Germans on 2 October 1870, and continued during the rest of the war to be an important centre of operations.

During World War II, the city suffered heavy damage by bombing and during the battle of Chartres in August 1944, but its cathedral was spared by an American Army officer who challenged the order to destroy it. On 16 August 1944, Colonel Welborn Barton Griffith, Jr. questioned the necessity of destroying the cathedral and volunteered to go behind enemy lines to find out whether the Germans were using it as an observation post. With his driver, Griffith proceeded to the cathedral and, after searching it all the way up its bell tower, confirmed to headquarters that it was empty of Germans. The order to destroy the cathedral was withdrawn.

Colonel Griffith was killed in action later on that day in the town of Lèves, north of Chartres. For his heroic action both at Chartres and Lèves, Colonel Griffith posthumously received several decorations awarded by the president of the United States and the U.S. military, and also from the French government.

Following deep reconnaissance missions in the region by the 3rd Cavalry Group and units of the 1139 Engineer Combat Group, and after heavy fighting in and around the city, Chartres was liberated, on 18 August 1944, by the U.S. 5th Infantry and 7th Armored Divisions belonging to the XX Corps of the U.S. Third Army commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr.

==Demographics==
==Geography==
Chartres is built on a hill on the left bank of the river Eure. Its renowned medieval cathedral is at the top of the hill, and its two spires are visible from miles away across the flat surrounding lands. To the southeast stretches the fertile plain of Beauce, the &quot;granary of France&quot;, in which Chartres is the commercial centre.

==Main sights==
===Cathedrals and churches===


Chartres is best known for its cathedral, the &quot;Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Chartres&quot;, which is considered one of the finest and best preserved Gothic cathedrals in France and in Europe. Its historical and cultural importance has been recognized by its inclusion on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.

It was built on the site of the former Chartres cathedral of Romanesque architecture, which was destroyed by fire in 1194 (that former cathedral had been built on the ruins of an ancient Celtic temple, later replaced by a Roman temple). Begun in 1205, the construction of &quot;Notre-Dame de Chartres&quot; was completed 66 years later.

The stained glass windows of the cathedral were financed by guilds of merchants and craftsmen, and by wealthy noblemen, whose names appear at the bottom.
It is not known how the famous and unique blue, &quot;bleu de Chartres&quot;, of the glass was created, and it has been impossible to replicate it. The French author Michel Pastoureau says that it could also be called &quot;bleu de Saint-Denis&quot;.

The &quot;Église Saint-Pierre de Chartres&quot; was the church of the Benedictine &quot;Abbaye Saint-Père-en-Vallée&quot;, founded in the 7th century by queen Balthild. At time of its construction, the abbey was outside the walls of the city. It contains fine stained glass and, formerly, twelve representations of the apostles in enamel, created about 1547 by Léonard Limosin, which now can be seen in the fine arts museum.

Other noteworthy churches of Chartres are &quot;Saint-Aignan&quot; (13th, 16th and 17th centuries), and &quot;Saint-Martin-au-Val&quot; (12th century), inside the Saint-Brice hospital.

===Museums===
* &quot;Musée des Beaux-Arts&quot;, Fine arts museum, housed in the former episcopal palace adjacent to the cathedral.
* &quot;Le Centre international du vitrail&quot;, a workshop-museum and cultural center devoted to stained glass art, located from the cathedral.
* &quot;Conservatoire du machinisme et des pratiques agricoles&quot;, an agricultural museum.
* &quot;Musée le grenier de l&#x27;histoire&quot;, history museum specializing in military uniforms and , in Lèves, a suburb of Chartres.
* &quot;Muséum des sciences naturelles et de la préhistoire&quot;, Natural science and Prehistory Museum (closed since 2015).

===Other sights===
The river Eure, which at this point divides into three branches, is crossed by several bridges, some of them ancient, and is fringed in places by remains of the old fortifications, of which the &quot;Porte Guillaume&quot; (14th century), a gateway flanked by towers, was the most complete specimen, until destroyed by the retreating German army in the night of 15 to 16 August 1944. The steep, narrow streets of the old town contrast with the wide, shady boulevards which encircle it and separate it from the suburbs. The &quot;parc André-Gagnon&quot; or &quot;Clos St. Jean&quot;, a pleasant park, lies to the north-west, and squares and open spaces are numerous.

Part of the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; (City Hall) is a building dating from the 17th century, called &quot;Hôtel Montescot&quot;. The &quot;Maison Canoniale&quot; dating back to the 13th century, and several medieval and Renaissance houses, are of interest.

There is a statue of General Marceau (1769–1796), a native of Chartres and a general during the French Revolution.

The &quot;Maison Picassiette&quot;, a house decorated inside and out with mosaics of shards of broken china and pottery, was built by Raymond Isidore.

==Economy==
Chartres is one of the most important market towns in the region of Beauce (known as &quot;the granary of France&quot;).

Historically, game pies and other delicacies of Chartres were well known, and the industries also included flour-milling, brewing, distilling, iron-founding, leather manufacture, perfumes, dyeing, stained glass, billiard requisites and hosiery.

Since 1976 the fashion and perfumes company Puig has had a production plant in this commune.

===Transport===
The Gare de Chartres railway station offers frequent services to Paris, and a few daily connections to Le Mans, Nogent-le-Rotrou and Courtalain. The A11 motorway connects Chartres with Paris and Le Mans.

==Sport==
Chartres is home to two semi-professional association football clubs; FC Chartres, who play in the French sixth division, and HB Chartres, who play in the seventh tier.

Chartres has a table tennis club which is playing in the Pro A (French First division) and in the European Champions League. The club won the ETTU Cup on the season 2010 – 2011 and it finished at the second position in the French First division.

Chartres has the second most important squash club in France.

There is also a handball club and it is playing in the French second division.

In November 2012, Chartres organized the European Short Course Swimming Championships.

==Diocese==
The town is the seat of a diocese (bishopric), a prefecture, and a &quot;cour d&#x27;assises&quot;. It has a &quot;Tribunal de grande instance&quot;, a &quot;Tribunal d&#x27;instance&quot;, a Chamber of commerce and a branch of the &quot;Banque de France&quot;.

Public and religious schooling from kindergarten through high school and vocational schools is given in mixed (boys and girls) establishments. The two main high schools are the &quot;Lycée Jehan de Beauce&quot; and the &quot;Lycée Marceau&quot;, named after two important personages of the history of Chartres: Jehan de Beauce was a 16th-century architect who rebuilt the northern steeple of the cathedral after it had been destroyed by lightning in July 1506, and Marceau, a native of city, who was a general during the French Revolution of 1789.

===Pilgrimages===
Chartres has been a site of Catholic pilgrimages since the Middle Ages. The poet Charles Péguy (1873–1914) revived the pilgrimage route between Paris and Chartres before World War I. After the war, some students carried on the pilgrimage in his memory. Since 1982, the association &quot;Notre-Dame de Chrétienté&quot;, with offices in Versailles, organizes the annual pilgrimage on foot from &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot; to &quot;Notre-Dame de Chartres&quot;. About 15,000 pilgrims, from France and countries outside France, participate every year.

<text>Michael Chabon ( ;
born May 24, 1963) is an American novelist, screenwriter, columnist, and short story writer. Born in Washington, D.C., he spent a year studying at Carnegie Mellon University before transferring to the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in 1984. He subsequently received a Master of Fine Arts in creative writing from the University of California, Irvine.

Chabon&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; (1988), was published when he was 24. He followed it with &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; (1995) and two short-story collections. In 2000, he published &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot;, a novel that John Leonard would later call Chabon&#x27;s magnum opus. It received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001.

His novel &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot;, an alternate history mystery novel, was published in 2007 and won the Hugo, Sidewise, Nebula and Ignotus awards; his serialized novel &quot;Gentlemen of the Road&quot; appeared in book form in the fall of the same year. In 2012, Chabon published &quot;Telegraph Avenue&quot;, billed as &quot;a twenty-first century &quot;Middlemarch&quot;&quot;, concerning the tangled lives of two families in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2004. He followed &quot;Telegraph Avenue&quot; in November 2016 with his latest novel, &quot;&quot;, a fictionalized memoir of his maternal grandfather, based on his deathbed confessions under the influence of powerful painkillers in Chabon&#x27;s mother&#x27;s California home in 1989.

Chabon&#x27;s work is characterized by complex language, and the frequent use of metaphor along with recurring themes such as nostalgia, divorce, abandonment, fatherhood, and most notably issues of Jewish identity. He often includes gay, bisexual, and Jewish characters in his work. Since the late 1990s, he has written in increasingly diverse styles for varied outlets; he is a notable defender of the merits of genre fiction and plot-driven fiction, and, along with novels, has published screenplays, children&#x27;s books, comics, and newspaper serials.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Chabon was born in Washington, D.C., to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. His parents are Robert Chabon, a physician and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. Chabon said he knew he wanted to be a writer when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, he recalls, &quot;I thought to myself, &#x27;That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s what I want to do. I can do this.&#x27; And I never had any second thoughts or doubts.&quot; Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised &quot;on a hearty diet of crap&quot;. His parents divorced when he was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where he lived nine months of the year with his mother, was &quot;a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered.&quot; He has written of his mother&#x27;s marijuana use, recalling her &quot;sometime around 1977 or so, sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy&#x27;s car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie.&quot; He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother&#x27;s parents and siblings.

Chabon attended Carnegie Mellon University for a year before transferring to the University of Pittsburgh, where he studied under Chuck Kinder and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1984. He then went to graduate school at the University of California, Irvine, where he received a Master of Fine Arts in creative writing.

===&quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; and initial literary success===
Chabon&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot;, was written as his UC Irvine master&#x27;s thesis. Without telling Chabon, his professor, Donald Heiney (better known by his pen name, MacDonald Harris), sent it to a literary agent, who got the author an impressive $155,000 advance on the novel, though most first-time novelists receive advances under $7,500. &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; appeared in 1988 and was a bestseller, instantly catapulting Chabon to literary celebrity. Among his major literary influences in this period were Donald Barthelme, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Raymond Chandler, John Updike, Philip Roth and F. Scott Fitzgerald. As he remarked in 2010, &quot;I just copied the writers whose voices I was responding to, and I think that&#x27;s probably the best way to learn.&quot;

Chabon was ambivalent about his newfound fame. He turned down offers to appear in a Gap ad and to be featured as one of &quot;People&quot;″s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot;. He later said of the &quot;People&quot; offer, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a shit [about it] ... I only take pride in things I&#x27;ve actually done myself. To be praised for something like that is just weird. It just felt like somebody calling and saying, &#x27;We want to put you in a magazine because the weather&#x27;s so nice where you live.&#x27; &quot;

In 2001, Chabon reflected on the success of his first novel by saying that while &quot;the upside was that I was published and I got a readership, ... [the] downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was still like, &#x27;Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?&#x27; It took me a few years to catch up.&quot; In 1991, he published &quot;A Model World&quot;, a collection of short stories, many of which were previously published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

===&quot;Fountain City&quot; and &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;===
After the success of &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot;, Chabon spent five years working on a second novel, &quot;Fountain City&quot;, a &quot;highly ambitious opus ... about an architect building a perfect baseball park in Florida.&quot; It ballooned to 1,500 pages, with no end in sight. The process was frustrating for Chabon, who, in his words, &quot;never felt like I was conceptually on steady ground.&quot;

At one point, he submitted a 672-page draft to his agent and editor, who disliked the work. Chabon had problems dropping the novel, though. &quot;It was really scary,&quot; he said later. &quot;I&#x27;d already signed a contract and been paid all this money. And then I&#x27;d gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife. My instincts were telling me, &#x27;This book is fucked. Just drop it.&#x27; But I didn&#x27;t, because I thought, &#x27;What if I have to give the money back?&#x27; &quot; &quot;I used to go down to my office and fantasize about all the books I could write instead.&quot; Chabon has confessed to being &quot;careless and sloppy&quot; when it came to his novels&#x27; plots, saying how he &quot;again and again falls back on the same basic story.&quot;

When he finally decided to abandon &quot;Fountain City&quot;, Chabon recalls staring at his blank computer for hours before suddenly picturing &quot;a straitlaced, troubled young man with a tendency toward melodrama, trying to end it all.&quot; He began writing, and within a couple of days had written 50 pages of what became his second novel, &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;. Chabon drew on his experiences with &quot;Fountain City&quot; for the character of Grady Tripp, a frustrated novelist who has spent years working on an immense fourth novel. He wrote &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; in a dizzy seven-month streak, without telling his agent or publisher he&#x27;d abandoned &quot;Fountain City&quot;. The book, published in 1995, was a commercial and critical success.

In late 2010, &quot;An annotated, four-chapter fragment&quot; from the unfinished 1,500 page &quot;Fountain City&quot; manuscript, &quot;complete with cautionary introduction and postscript&quot; written by Chabon, was included in &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s 36&quot;.

Among the supporters of &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; was &quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Jonathan Yardley; however, despite declaring Chabon &quot;the young star of American letters&quot;, Yardley argued that, in his works to that point, Chabon had been preoccupied &quot;with fictional explorations of his own ... It is time for him to move on, to break away from the first person and explore larger worlds.&quot; Chabon later said that he took Yardley&#x27;s criticism to heart, explaining, &quot;It chimed with my own thoughts. I had bigger ambitions.&quot; In 1999 he published his second collection of short stories, &quot;Werewolves in Their Youth&quot;, which included his first published foray into genre fiction, the grim horror story &quot;In the Black Mill&quot;.

Shortly after completing &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, Chabon discovered a box of comic books from his childhood; a reawakened interest in comics, coupled with memories of the &quot;lore&quot; his Brooklyn-born father had told him about &quot;the middle years of the twentieth century in America. ...the radio shows, politicians, movies, music, and athletes, and so forth, of that era,&quot; inspired him to begin work on a new novel. In 2000, he published &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot;, an epic historical novel that charts 16 years in the lives of Sammy Clay and Joe Kavalier, two Jewish cousins who create a wildly popular series of comic books in the early 1940s, the years leading up to the entry of the U.S. into World War II. The novel received &quot;nearly unanimous praise&quot; and became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller, eventually winning the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Chabon reflected that, in writing &quot;Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot;, &quot;I discovered strengths I had hoped that I possessed—the ability to pull off multiple points of view, historical settings, the passage of years—but which had never been tested before.&quot;

===&quot;Summerland&quot;, &quot;The Final Solution&quot;, &quot;Gentlemen of the Road&quot;, and &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot;===

In 2002, Chabon published &quot;Summerland&quot;, a fantasy novel written for younger readers that received mixed reviews but sold extremely well, and won the 2003 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. Two years later, he published &quot;The Final Solution&quot;, a novella about an investigation led by an unknown old man, whom the reader can guess to be Sherlock Holmes, during the final years of World War II. His Dark Horse Comics project &quot;The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist&quot;, a quarterly anthology series that was published from 2004 to 2006, purported to cull stories from an involved, fictitious 60-year history of the Escapist character created by the protagonists of &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot;. It was awarded the 2005 Eisner Award for Best Anthology and a pair of Harvey Awards for Best Anthology and Best New Series.

In late 2006, Chabon completed work on &quot;Gentlemen of the Road&quot;, a 15-part serialized novel that ran in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; from January 28 to May 6, 2007. The serial (which at one point had the working title &quot;Jews with Swords&quot;) was described by Chabon as &quot;a swashbuckling adventure story set around the year 1000.&quot; Just before &quot;Gentlemen of the Road&quot; completed its run, the author published his next novel, &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot;, which he had worked on since February 2002. A hard-boiled detective story that imagines an alternate history in which Israel collapsed in 1948 and European Jews settled in Alaska, the novel was released on May 1, 2007, to enthusiastic reviews, and spent six weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. The novel also won the 2008 Hugo Award.

===&quot;Manhood for Amateurs&quot; and &quot;Telegraph Avenue&quot;===
In May 2007, Chabon said that he was working on a young-adult novel with &quot;some fantastic content.&quot; A month later, the author said he had put plans for the young-adult book on hold, and instead had signed a two-book deal with HarperCollins.

The first, a book-length work of non-fiction called &quot;Manhood for Amateurs: The Pleasures and Regrets of a Husband, Father, and Son&quot;, was published in spring 2009 (2010 in Europe); the work discusses &quot;being a man in all its complexity—a son, a father, a husband.&quot; The collection was nominated for a 2010 Northern California Book Award in the Creative Nonfiction category. This was Chabon&#x27;s second published collection of essays and non-fiction. McSweeney&#x27;s published &quot;Maps and Legends&quot;, a collection of Chabon&#x27;s literary essays, on May 1, 2008. Proceeds from the book benefited 826 National. Also in 2008, Chabon received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award, presented annually by the Tulsa (Oklahoma) Library Trust.

During a 2007 interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Chabon discussed his second book under the contract, saying, &quot;I would like it to be set in the present day and feel right now the urge to do something more mainstream than my recent work has been.&quot; During a Q&amp;A session in January 2009, Chabon added that he was writing a &quot;naturalistic&quot; novel about two families in Berkeley. In a March 2010 interview with the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper, Chabon added that &quot;So far there&#x27;s no overtly genre content: it&#x27;s set in the present day and has no alternate reality or anything like that.&quot;

&quot;Telegraph Avenue&quot;, adapted from an idea for a TV series pilot that Chabon was asked to write in 1999, is a social novel set on the borders between Oakland and Berkeley in the summer of 2004 that sees a &quot;large cast of characters grapple with infidelity, fatherhood, crooked politicians, racism, nostalgia and buried secrets.&quot; Chabon said upon publication in an interview with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; that the novel concerns &quot;the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds, heritage and history.&quot; Five years in gestation, &quot;Telegraph Avenue&quot; had a difficult birth, Chabon telling the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper, &quot;I got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop... I had to start all over again, keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element.&quot; After starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; onward, Chabon feels that &quot;Telegraph Avenue&quot; is a significant &quot;unification&quot; of his earlier and later styles, declaring in an interview, &quot;I could do whatever I wanted to do in this book and it would be OK even if it verged on crime fiction, even if it verged on magic realism, even if it verged on martial arts fiction... I was open to all of that and yet I didn&#x27;t have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction, that that was another genre for me now and I felt free to mix them all in a sense.&quot; The novel has been optioned by film producer Scott Rudin (who previously optioned and produced &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;), and Cameron Crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay, according to Chabon.

In a public lecture and reading of the novel in Oakland, California, Chabon listed creative influences as broad as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Altman, and William Faulkner.

===&quot;Moonglow&quot;, &quot;Pops&quot;, &quot;Bookends&quot;, and current work===
Chabon&#x27;s latest novel, &quot;Moonglow&quot;, was published November 22, 2016. The novel is a quasi-metafictional memoir, based upon the deathbed confessions of Chabon&#x27;s grandfather in the late 1980s.

Chabon followed-up &quot;Moonglow&quot; in summer 2017 with the edited collection &quot;Kingdom of Olives and Ash: Writers Confront the Occupation&quot;, a non-fiction collection of essays by writers concerning the continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, featuring contributions from writers including Dave Eggers, Colum McCann, and Geraldine Brooks. Chabon co-edited the volume with Ayelet Waldman, and they both contributed essays to the collection. Chabon had previously weighed in on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2010, having written an op-ed piece for the &quot;New York Times&quot; in June 2010 in which he noted the role of exceptionalism in Jewish identity, in relation to the &quot;blockheadedness&quot; of Israel&#x27;s botching of the Gaza flotilla raid and the explanations that followed.

&quot;Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces&quot; was published in May 2018. &quot;Pops&quot; is a short non-fiction memoir/essay collection, the essays thematically linked by the rewards and challenges of various aspects of fatherhood and family.

Chabon&#x27;s next non-fiction book, &quot;Bookends: Collected Intros and Outros&quot;, was published in January 2019. This volume is a collections of introductions, afterwords, and liner notes that Chabon has contributed over the years to various books and other projects, also exploring Chabon&#x27;s own literary influences and ideas about writing and reading. The book serves as a fundraiser for MacDowell, to which Chabon is contributing all royalties.

In an interview with the American Booksellers Association promoting &quot;Moonglow&quot; in November 2016, Chabon stated that his next fiction project would be &quot;...a long overdue follow-up—but not a sequel—to &quot;Summerland&quot;, my book for a somewhat younger readership. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been trying to get around to for a long time.&quot;

Despite his success, Chabon continues to perceive himself as a &quot;failure&quot;, noting that &quot;anyone who has ever received a bad review knows how it outlasts, by decades, the memory of a favorable word.&quot;

===Amazon vs. Hachette controversy===
In 2014, Amazon.com, a leading book distributor, was in a dispute with Hachette, a publisher. Hundreds of authors, Chabon included, condemned Amazon in an open letter because Amazon stopped taking pre-orders for books published by Hachette.

===Personal life===
After the publication of &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot;, Chabon was mistakenly featured in a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article on up-and-coming gay writers (&quot;Pittsburgh&quot;″s protagonist has liaisons with people of both sexes). &quot;The New York Times&quot; later reported that &quot;in some ways, [Chabon] was happy&quot; for the magazine&#x27;s error, and quoted him as saying, &quot;I feel very lucky about all of that. It really opened up a new readership to me, and a very loyal one.&quot; In a 2002 interview, Chabon added, &quot;If &quot;Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; is about anything in terms of human sexuality and identity, it&#x27;s that people can&#x27;t be put into categories all that easily.&quot; In &quot;On &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot;&quot;, an essay he wrote for the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; in 2005, Chabon remarked on the autobiographical events that helped inspire his first novel: &quot;I had slept with one man whom I loved, and learned to love another man so much that it would never have occurred to me to want to sleep with him.&quot;

In 1987, Chabon married the poet Lollie Groth. According to Chabon, the popularity of &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; had adverse effects; he later explained, &quot;I was married at the time to someone else who was also a struggling writer, and the success created a gross imbalance in our careers, which was problematic.&quot; He and Groth divorced in 1991.

He married the Israeli-born writer Ayelet Waldman in 1993. They live together in Berkeley, California, with their four children. Chabon has said that the &quot;creative free-flow&quot; he has with Waldman inspired the relationship between Sammy Clay and Rosa Saks toward the end of &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot;, and in 2007, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; declared the couple &quot;a famous—and famously in love—writing pair, like Nick and Nora Charles with word processors and not so much booze.&quot;
In a 2012 interview with Guy Raz of &quot;Weekend All Things Considered&quot;, Chabon said that he writes from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. each day, Sunday through Thursday. He tries to write 1,000 words a day. Commenting on the rigidity of his routine, Chabon said, &quot;There have been plenty of self-destructive rebel-angel novelists over the years, but writing is about getting your work done and getting your work done every day. If you want to write novels, they take a long time, and they&#x27;re big, and they have a lot of words in them... The best environment, at least for me, is a very stable, structured kind of life.&quot;

Chabon was a vocal endorser of Barack Obama during his 2008 election campaign, and wrote an enthusiastic opinion piece on Obama for the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, titled &quot;Obama &amp; the Conquest of Denver&quot;, in October 2008. Subsequently, Chabon included a brief, fictionalized &#x27;cameo&#x27; by Obama in his 2012 novel &quot;Telegraph Avenue&quot;.

Since 2016, Chabon has been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, both during his campaign for the presidency (signing a petition with over 400 other writers against his candidacy in May 2016), and during his administration. During an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; before Trump&#x27;s inauguration in January 2017, Chabon remarked of the incoming president, &quot;I really have no idea what to expect. He&#x27;s so unpredictable. He&#x27;s so mercurial. You know, I would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than if he said he was going to take them all out to be shot. He&#x27;s like a random impulse generator.&quot; In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of Trump: &quot;Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn my phone on to see what the latest news is, I have this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he&#x27;s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted out of the White House on a gurney.&quot;

== Interest in genre fiction ==
In a 2002 essay, Chabon decried the state of modern short fiction (including his own), saying that, with rare exceptions, it consisted solely of &quot;the contemporary, quotidian, plotless, moment-of-truth revelatory story.&quot; In an apparent reaction against these &quot;plotless [stories] sparkling with epiphanic dew,&quot; Chabon&#x27;s post-2000 work has been marked by an increased interest in genre fiction and plot. While &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; was, like &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; and &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, an essentially realistic, contemporary novel (whose plot happened to revolve around comic-book superheroes), Chabon&#x27;s subsequent works—such as &quot;The Final Solution&quot;, his dabbling with comic-book writing, and the &quot;swashbuckling adventure&quot; of &quot;Gentlemen of the Road&quot;—have been almost exclusively devoted to mixing aspects of genre and literary fiction. Perhaps the most notable example of this is &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot;, which won five genre awards, including the Hugo Award and Nebula Award. Chabon seeks to &quot;annihilate&quot; not the genres themselves, but the bias against certain genres of fiction such as fantasy, science fiction and romance.

Chabon&#x27;s forays into genre fiction have met with mixed critical reaction. One science fiction short story by Chabon, &quot;The Martian Agent&quot;, was described by a reviewer as &quot;enough to send readers back into the cold but reliable arms of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.&quot; Another critic wrote of the same story that it was &quot;richly plotted, action-packed&quot;, and that &quot;Chabon skilfully elaborates his world and draws not just on the steampunk worlds of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling and Michael Moorcock, but on alternate histories by brilliant science fiction mavericks such as Avram Davidson and Howard Waldrop. The imperial politics are craftily resonant and the story keeps us hanging on.&quot; While &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called &quot;The Final Solution&quot; &quot;an ingenious, fully imagined work, an expert piece of literary ventriloquism, and a mash note to the beloved boys&#x27; tales of Chabon&#x27;s youth,&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;[T]he genre of the comic book is an anemic vein for novelists to mine, lest they squander their brilliance.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that the detective story, &quot;a genre that is by its nature so constrained, so untransgressive, seems unlikely to appeal to the real writer,&quot; but adds that &quot;... Chabon makes good on his claim: a successful detective story need not be lacking in literary merit.&quot;

In 2005, Chabon argued against the idea that genre fiction and entertaining fiction should not appeal to &quot;the real writer&quot;, saying that the common perception is that &quot;Entertainment ... means junk... [But] maybe the reason for the junkiness of so much of what pretends to entertain us is that we have accepted—indeed, we have helped to articulate—such a narrow, debased concept of entertainment... I&#x27;d like to believe that, because I read for entertainment, and I write to entertain. Period.&quot;

One of the more positive responses to Chabon&#x27;s brand of &quot;trickster literature&quot; appeared in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, whose Lev Grossman wrote that &quot;This is literature in mid-transformation... [T]he highbrow and the lowbrow, once kept chastely separate, are now hooking up, [and] you can almost see the future of literature coming.&quot; Grossman classed Chabon with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing, including Jonathan Lethem (with whom Chabon is friends), Margaret Atwood, and Susanna Clarke.

On the other hand, in &quot;Slate&quot; in 2007, Ruth Franklin said, &quot;Michael Chabon has spent considerable energy trying to drag the decaying corpse of genre fiction out of the shallow grave where writers of serious literature abandoned it.&quot;

===The Van Zorn persona===
For some of his own genre work, Chabon has forged an unusual horror/fantasy fiction persona under the name of August Van Zorn. More elaborately developed than a pseudonym, August Van Zorn is purported to be a pen name for one Albert Vetch (1899–1963). In Chabon&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, narrator Grady Tripp writes that he grew up in the same hotel as Vetch, who worked as an English professor at the (nonexistent) Coxley College and wrote hundreds of pulp stories that were &quot;in the gothic mode, after the manner of Lovecraft ... but written in a dry, ironic, at times almost whimsical idiom.&quot; A horror-themed short story titled &quot;In the Black Mill&quot; was published in &quot;Playboy&quot; in June 1997 and reprinted in Chabon&#x27;s 1999 story collection &quot;Werewolves in Their Youth&quot;, and was attributed to Van Zorn.

Chabon has created a comprehensive bibliography for Van Zorn, along with an equally fictional literary scholar devoted to his oeuvre named Leon Chaim Bach. Bach&#x27;s now-defunct website (which existed under the auspices of Chabon&#x27;s) declared Van Zorn to be, &quot;without question, the greatest unknown horror writer of the twentieth century,&quot; and mentioned that Bach had once edited a collection of short stories by Van Zorn titled &quot;The Abominations of Plunkettsburg&quot;. (The name &quot;Leon Chaim Bach&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Michael Chabon&quot;, as is &quot;Malachi B. Cohen&quot;, the name of a fictional comics expert who wrote occasional essays about the Escapist for the character&#x27;s Dark Horse Comic series.) In 2004, Chabon established the August Van Zorn Prize, &quot;awarded to the short story that most faithfully and disturbingly embodies the tradition of the weird short story as practiced by Edgar Allan Poe and his literary descendants, among them August Van Zorn.&quot; The first recipient of the prize was Jason Roberts, whose winning story, &quot;7C&quot;, was then included in &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories&quot;, edited by Chabon.

A scene in the film adaptation of Chabon&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; shows two characters in a bookstore stocking August Van Zorn books.

== The Chabon universe ==

Chabon has provided several subtle hints throughout his work that the stories he tells take place in a shared fictional universe. One recurring character, who is mentioned in three of Chabon&#x27;s books but never actually appears, is Eli Drinkwater, a fictional catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates who died abruptly after crashing his car on Mt. Nebo Road. The most detailed exposition of Drinkwater&#x27;s life appears in Chabon&#x27;s 1990 short story &quot;Smoke&quot;, which is set at Drinkwater&#x27;s funeral, and refers to him as &quot;a scholarly catcher, a redoubtable batsman, and a kind, affectionate person.&quot; Drinkwater was again referred to (though not by name) in Chabon&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, in which narrator Grady Tripp explains that his sportswriter friend Happy Blackmore was hired &quot;to ghost the autobiography of a catcher, a rising star who played for Pittsburgh and hit the sort of home runs that linger in the memory for years.&quot;

Tripp explains that Blackmore turned in an inadequate draft, his book contract was cancelled, and the catcher died shortly afterwards, &quot;leaving nothing in Happy&#x27;s notorious &#x27;files&#x27; but the fragments and scribblings of a ghost.&quot; In Chabon&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Summerland&quot; (2002), it is suggested that Blackmore was eventually able to find a publisher for the biography; the character Jennifer T. mentions that she has read a book called &quot;Eli Drinkwater: A Life in Baseball&quot;, written by Happy Blackmore. Drinkwater&#x27;s name may have been selected in homage to contemporary author John Crowley, whom Chabon is on the record as admiring. Crowley&#x27;s novel &quot;Little, Big&quot; featured a main character named Alice Drinkwater.

There are also instances in which character surnames reappear from story to story. Cleveland Arning, a character in Chabon&#x27;s 1988 debut novel, &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot;, is described as having come from a wealthy family, one that might be expected to be able to endow a building. Near the end of &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; (1995), it is mentioned that, on the unnamed college campus at which Grady Tripp teaches, there is a building called Arning Hall &quot;where the English faculty kept office hours.&quot; Similarly, in Chabon&#x27;s 1989 short story &quot;A Model World&quot;, a character named Levine discovers, or rather plagiarizes, a formula for &quot;nephokinesis&quot; (or cloud control) that wins him respect and prominence in the meteorological field. In &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; (2000), a passing reference is made to the &quot;massive Levine School of Applied Meteorology,&quot; ostensibly a building owned by New York University.

== Songwriting work ==
In 2014, Chabon was involved in writing lyrics for Mark Ronson&#x27;s album &quot;Uptown Special&quot;. In an interview with WCBN-FM, Chabon described meeting Ronson at a party, and later being contacted to write a song. Chabon penned &quot;Crack in the Pearl&quot;, and after growing chemistry with Ronson and Jeff Bhasker, worked on more songs for the album. One of these included the single &quot;Daffodils&quot;, which he wrote with Kevin Parker of Tame Impala. In total, Chabon helped write 9 of the 11 songs on the album, not including mega-smash hit, &quot;Uptown Funk&quot;. He has also collaborated with Adam Schlesinger on the song &quot;House of Broken Gingerbread&quot; written for the Monkees&#x27; October 2018 album Christmas Party. He also co-wrote &quot;Boxes&quot; for Moses Sumney, and wrote for an unreleased Charlie Puth song.

Some of Chabon&#x27;s musical influences include Steely Dan and Yes.

== Film and television work ==
Although Chabon once described his attitude toward Hollywood as &quot;pre-emptive cynicism&quot;, for years the author has worked to bring both adapted and original projects to the screen. In 1994, Chabon pitched a screenplay entitled &quot;The Gentleman Host&quot; to producer Scott Rudin, a romantic comedy &quot;about old Jewish folks on a third-rate cruise ship out of Miami.&quot; Rudin bought the project and developed it with Chabon, but it was never filmed, partly due to the release of the similarly themed film &quot;Out to Sea&quot; in 1997. In the nineties, Chabon also pitched story ideas for both the X-Men and Fantastic Four films, but was rejected.

When Rudin was adapting &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; for the screen, the author declined an offer to write the screenplay, saying he was too busy writing &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot;. Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot;, Rudin then asked Chabon to work on that film&#x27;s screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel&#x27;s film adaptation, the project has been mired in pre-production for years.

Chabon&#x27;s work, however, remains popular in Hollywood, with Rudin purchasing the film rights to &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot;, then titled &quot;Hatzeplatz&quot;, in 2002, five years before the book would be published. The same year, Miramax bought the rights to &quot;Summerland&quot; and &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; (a planned collection of eight genre short stories that Chabon has not yet written), each of which was optioned for a sum in the mid-six figures. Chabon also wrote a draft for 2004&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, about a third of which was used in the final film. Soon after &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; was released, director Sam Raimi mentioned that he hoped to hire Chabon to work on the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;if I can get him,&quot; but Chabon never worked on &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;.

In October 2004, it was announced that Chabon was at work writing Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow and the Seven&quot;, a live-action martial arts retelling of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; to be directed by master Hong Kong fight choreographer and director Yuen Wo Ping. In August 2006, Chabon said that he had been replaced on &quot;Snow&quot;, sarcastically explaining that the producers wanted to go in &quot;more of a fun direction.&quot;

Although Chabon was uninvolved with the project, director Rawson Marshall Thurber shot a film adaptation of &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; in fall 2006. The film, which stars Sienna Miller and Peter Sarsgaard, was released in April 2008. In February 2008, Rudin reported that a film adaptation of &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot; was in pre-production, to be written and directed by the Coen brothers. However, as of 2018, Chabon expressed skepticism that the Coens would make the film, saying that they had effectively chosen to make &quot;A Serious Man&quot; instead, and did not wish to do another film with such similar themes.

In April 2009, Chabon confirmed he had been hired to do revisions to the script for Disney&#x27;s &quot;John Carter&quot;. In July 2015, Chabon was hired to do revisions to the script for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Bob the Musical&quot;.

Chabon joined the writing team of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series starring Patrick Stewart, and was named showrunner in July 2019. In November 2018, a &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; episode co-written by Chabon, titled &quot;Calypso&quot;, was released. Another short, written only by Chabon and titled &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;, was released on October 5, 2019. Chabon&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; series premiered on January 23, 2020, with Chabon referring to himself as a lifelong &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan. After the release of Season 1 of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, Chabon said in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; in March 2020 that he would be involved with Season 2 of &quot;Picard&quot;, but as an executive producer rather than as showrunner.

Chabon was also listed as co-creator of the Netflix miniseries &quot;Unbelievable&quot;, and has been working on a television adaptation of &quot;Kavalier and Clay&quot; with his wife Ayelet Waldman since at least December 2019.

In April 2021, following an article in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; which alleged numerous instances of physical and emotional abuse from Rudin towards his employees, Chabon wrote a public apology, stating that he had &quot;regularly, even routinely&quot; heard Rudin shout at and insult staff during their twenty years of collaboration, and had once witnessed Rudin throw a pencil at an employee&#x27;s head. Chabon said, &quot;I&#x27;m ashamed. I regret, and I want to apologize for, my part in enabling Scott Rudin&#x27;s abuse, simply by standing by, saying nothing, looking the other way.&quot;

<text>Natura Artis Magistra (Latin for &quot;Nature is the teacher of art&quot;), commonly known just as Artis (), is a zoo and botanical garden in the centre of Amsterdam. It is the oldest zoo in the Netherlands and fifth oldest zoo in the world.

In addition to the zoo, Artis also contains an aquarium, a planetarium, an arboretum, Micropia, and the Groote Museum. A part of the art collection is on display in the aquarium building of the zoo. Artis contains 27 historically significant (listed) buildings, bridges, and ponds, most of which are still used as animal enclosures.

The zoo is a member of the Dutch Zoo Federation (NVD), the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), Species360, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) and the (NVBT).

==History==
The zoo was founded in 1838 by three zoology enthusiasts, Gerard Westerman, J.W.H. Werlemann and J.J. Wijsmuller (also known as the three Ws). It was initially open only to members. Starting in 1851 it was opened to the public during the month of September. In 1920 it was opened year-round to the public, but September remains discount month.

The core of the current zoo property, then the &quot;Middenhof&quot; estate, was purchased by the board of the zoological society &quot;Natura Artis Magistra&quot; late in 1838 in the Plantage, which was then a thinly populated area on the outskirts of Amsterdam. From the start it exhibited both live and mounted specimens.

The zoo is commonly referred to as Artis, because the zoo has three gates with the words &#x27;Natura&#x27;, &#x27;Artis&#x27;, and &#x27;Magistra&#x27; written above each of them, respectively, which combined formed its actual name. More often than not, only the middle gate was open, so that people who walked through it, seeing that &#x27;Artis&#x27; was written above it, believed that the zoo was just called Artis. Thanks to this, soon few people knew it by its full name: Natura Artis Magistra.

The last quagga in captivity died at Artis on 12 August 1883, because all zebras were referred to as quagga, nobody realized this was the last quagga alive until years later.

==Historic buildings==

Artis includes 27 historic buildings. The aquarium was built in 1882 on land leased from the city on condition that only a museum ever be built on it. The Heimans-diorama (1926) is located in the back of the aquarium. The library dates back to 1867 and the building the &#x27;Ledenlokalen&#x27; on the right side of the main entrance dates back to the 19th century as well.

The wolf house (formerly an inn), and the Masman Garden House which now houses scarlet ibis were both on the site before the zoo was established.

==Library==
Artis has a library on the history of zoology and botany. It houses the library of the zoo, as well as the libraries of the Zoological Museum Amsterdam and the Amsterdam Botanical Garden. It also hosts the archives of a number of zoologists and botanists, such as the archive of Hugo de Vries. It contains 20,000 books, 3000 manuscripts and 80,000 animal prints.

The library is part of the special collections of the University of Amsterdam.

<doc id="98654" wikidata="Q736026" url="?curid=98654" title="Jo Cals">
<text>Jozef Maria Laurens Theo &quot;Jo&quot; Cals (18 July 1914 – 30 December 1971) was a Dutch politician of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) and jurist who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 14 April 1965 until 22 November 1966.

Cals studied law at the Radboud University Nijmegen obtaining a Master of Laws degree and worked as a lawyer and prosecutor in Nijmegen from November 1940 until August 1948 and as researcher at his alma mater from February 1941 until May 1949. Cals also worked as a legal and economics teacher in Roermond from October 1943 until June 1945. Cals became a member of the House of Representatives shortly after 1948 general election taking office on 19 August 1948 serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for education and social work. Following a cabinet reshuffle he was appointed as State Secretary for Education, Arts and Sciences in the Drees–Van Schaik cabinet, taking office on 15 March 1950. The Drees–Van Schaik cabinet fell on 24 January 1951 and was replaced by the first Drees cabinet, with Cals continuing his office. After the 1952 general election, Cals was appointed as Minister of Education, Arts and Sciences in the second Drees cabinet, taking office on 2 September 1952. After the 1956 general election, Cals retained his position in the third Drees cabinet. The third Drees cabinet fell on 11 December 1958 and was replaced by the caretaker second Beel cabinet, with Cals continuing his function. After the 1959 general election, Cals once again retained his office in the De Quay cabinet. After the 1963 general election, Cals was not offered a cabinet post in the new cabinet and returned to the House of Representatives on 2 July 1963, serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for the interior and Kingdom relations. Cals also became active in the public sector as a non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government.

After the fall of the Marijnen cabinet, Cals was asked to lead a new cabinet. Following a successful cabinet formation, Cals formed the Cals cabinet and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands, taking office on 14 April 1965. The cabinet fell just one year into its term after a major political crisis and following a difficult cabinet formation was not included in a new cabinet. Cals left office upon the installation of the caretaker Zijlstra cabinet on 22 November 1966 and announced his retirement.

Cals semi-retired from active politics at just 52 and became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director, and served as a diplomat and lobbyist for several economic delegations and presided over several state commissions and councils for the government. Cals was known for his abilities as a efficient manager and his work ethics. During his premiership, his cabinet were responsible for major social reforms to social security, closing the mines in Limburg and stimulating urban development in the Randstad. Cals was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 5 December 1966 and continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and died in December 1971 at the age of just 57. He holds the distinction of as the fourth longest-serving cabinet member since 1850 with 14 years and 353 days and his premiership is consistently considered both by scholars and the public to have been average.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Jozef Maria Laurens Theo Cals was born in Roermond on 18 July 1914. After completing his secondary education in his home town, he studied for the priesthood in Rolduc. In 1935, however, he interrupted his theological training to study law at the Radboud University Nijmegen, after graduating in 1940 he practised law in that same city up until 1950, in the meantime also teaching economics at his old secondary school in Roermond.

===Politics===
In 1945 Cals became leader of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party in the municipal council of Nijmegen until 1946. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1948. From 15 March 1950 to 2 September 1952 he was State Secretary for Education, Arts and Sciences, serving from 15 March 1950 until 2 September 1952 in the Drees-Van Schaik and Drees I cabinets. He became Minister of Education, Arts and Sciences serving from 2 September 1952 until 24 July 1963 in the cabinets Drees II and III, Beel II and De Quay, he helped pass the &quot;Mammoetwet&quot;, a law that transformed secondary education. In the debate, he spoke for 6 hours and 50 minutes, setting a record. In 1963, however, he returned to the House of Representatives. Alongside his duties there, he was a member of the board of governors of the University of Groningen, chairman of the Arts Council and a member of the Press Council.

In the aftermath of the collapse of the Marijnen cabinet, Cals became Prime Minister of the Netherlands on 14 April 1965. After two decades of economic growth, his cabinet experienced a slight recession. Plans to build sports halls, roads and houses had to be tempered. In Limburg the coal mines were closed and plans were drawn to educate and re-employ the former miners. There was also social unrest (&#x27;the sixties&#x27;), which became apparent in the Provo movement, construction worker protests, riots over the marriage of princess Beatrix in Amsterdam and the rise of new parties like Farmers&#x27; Party (BP), Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP), Reformed Political League (GPV) and the Democrats 66 (D&#x27;66). Especially the last party wanted to change the political order.

On 14 October 1966, Norbert Schmelzer, the leader of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party and chair of its parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, tabled a motion that was interpreted as a motion of no confidence against the government and Prime Minister Cals. A shocking and surprised action in Dutch politics, later known as the Night of Schmelzer, it marked the first time that a motion of no confidence was tabled against a government by a member of a government party. The cabinet resigned the next day.

===Scouting===
Cals was in 1930, just after the foundation as a separate Scouting organisation, one of the first members of De Katholieke Verkenners (The Catholic Scouts). He went to the 4th World Scout Jamboree in Gödöllo, Hungary in 1933. After the liberation of the southern part of the Netherlands in 1944 he was one of the main forces in rebuilding Catholic Scouting as a separate Scouting movement in the Netherlands. During his second term as Minister of Education, Arts and Sciences, the State Secretary for Education, Arts and Sciences was his former Scout Master René Höppener.

===Trivia===
Between 1968 and 1970, Cals was in charge of the Dutch entry to the Expo &#x27;70 in Japan. From 1967 he was chairman of the National Advisory Committee on the amendment of the Constitution.

Cals was a hard worker but this was at the expense of his health, he died from a brain tumor in the MCH Westeinde hospital in The Hague on 30 December 1971 at the age of 57.

<text>Llandaff Cathedral () is an Anglican cathedral and parish church in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales. It is the seat of the Bishop of Llandaff, head of the Church in Wales Diocese of Llandaff. It is dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and three Welsh saints: Dubricius (), Teilo and Oudoceus (). It is one of two cathedrals in Cardiff, the other being the Roman Catholic Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral in the city centre.

The current building was constructed in the 12th century on the site of an earlier church. Severe damage was done to the church in 1400 during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr, during the English Civil War when it was overrun by Parliamentarian troops, and during the Great Storm of 1703. By 1717, the damage to the cathedral was so extensive that the church seriously considered the removal of the see. Following further storms in the early 1720s, work was begun in 1734 on a new cathedral designed by John Wood, the Elder, but this was never completed, and instead a major restoration by John Prichard was carried out in the 1840s and 1850s. In January 1941, during the Cardiff Blitz of the Second World War, the cathedral was severely damaged by a parachute mine that blew the roof off the nave, south aisle and chapter house. The stonework which remains from the medieval period is primarily Dundry stone from Somerset, though local blue lias constitutes most of the stonework dating from the post-Reformation period. The work done on the church since World War II is primarily of concrete and Pennant sandstone, and the roofs, of Welsh slate and lead, were added during the post-war rebuilding. In February 2007, the organ was damaged during a severe lightning strike, following which there was a successful appeal for £1.5 million for an entirely new organ.

For many years, the cathedral had the traditional Anglican choir of boys and men, and more recently a girls&#x27; choir, with the only dedicated choir school in the Church in Wales, the Cathedral School, Llandaff. The cathedral contains a number of notable tombs, including Dubricius, a 6th-century British saint who evangelised Ergyng (now Archenfield) and much of South-East Wales; Meurig ap Tewdrig, King of Gwent; Teilo, a 6th-century Welsh clergyman, church founder and saint; and many Bishops of Llandaff, from the 7th-century Oudoceus to the 19th-century Alfred Ollivant, who was bishop from 1849 to 1882.

==History==
===Legendary origins===

There is common consensus that the Norman cathedral was constructed on the site of an ancient Celtic church, but there is little consensus on the original church&#x27;s age, importance or size.

==== Lucius of Britain ====
Welsh tradition associates the church&#x27;s founding with Lucius, the legendary 2nd-century King of the Britons and the first Christian convert in Britain. Lucius was believed to have beseeched Pope (Eleutherius) to convert him to Christianity. The Pope&#x27;s response was to send a Christian mission to Britain, which would include the building of Britain&#x27;s first church. The Welsh Triads relate this tradition to Llandaff, stating that Lucius &quot;made the first Church at Llandaf, which was the first in the Isle of Britain.&quot; another triad lists &quot;the three archbishoprics of the Isle of Britain&quot; and states that &quot;the first was Llandaf, of the gift of Lleirwg (Lucius), the son of Coel, the son of Cyllin, who first gave lands and civil privileges to such as first embraced the faith in Christ.&quot; Although the Lucius legend is now considered to be pseudo-history, it was recounted by Nennius, Bede and Geoffrey of Monmouth, and seems to have been widely accepted in the medieval period.

Four names are associated with the task of executing the Pope&#x27;s wishes; these include the early Welsh saints Fagan, Deruvian and Elvan. Fagan is sometimes named as &quot;the first Bishop of Llandaff&quot; while all three became patrons of churches and villages throughout the diocese. Iolo Morgannwg also linked these early figures to Llandaff, writing extensively on this supposed early foundation. In the Iolo Manuscripts, he credits Fagan as the second Bishop of Llandaff (succeeding Dyfan, a figure Iolo conflates with Deruvian).

==== Saint Dubricius ====

In their writings on Lucius of Britain, both Geoffrey of Monmouth and Iolo Morganwg state that the original Christian community at Llandaff was re-established by Saint Dyfrig (Dubricius) and his successor, Saint Teilo. The most notable legends surrounding these two state that Saint Dyfrig was made Archbishop by Saint Germanus of Auxerre while he travelled through Britain to oppose the Pelagian heresy, and link both saints with King Arthur.

The Normans considered Dyfrig and Teilo as the cathedral&#x27;s founders and they, along with their successor Oudoceus, are the modern cathedral&#x27;s patron saints. The continuation of a Post-Roman church is supported by the high number of ancient remains at the site (most notably an ancient Celtic cross at the Bishop&#x27;s Court&#x27;s well) and both secular and ecclesiastical writings.

===Norman cathedral===
The Normans occupied Glamorgan early in the Norman conquest, appointing Urban their first bishop in 1107. He began construction of the cathedral in 1120 and had the remains of Saint Dyfrig transferred from Bardsey. After the death of Urban, it is believed the work was completed some time in the last years of Bishop Nicholas ap Gwrgant, who died in 1183. The cathedral was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, Dubricius, Teilo and Oudoceus.

Bishop Henry de Abergavenny organised the Llandaff Cathedral chapter circa 1214. He appointed fourteen prebends, eight priests, four deacons and two sub-deacons. De Abergavenny also made changes to Llandaff&#x27;s episcopal seal, giving more detail to the figure of the bishop depicted on it and adding the phrase &quot;by the grace of God&quot; to its inscription. The west front dates from 1220 and contains a statue of St Teilo. By 1266, the structure that Urban began had been altered; the cathedral was dedicated again in 1266.

The Lady Chapel was built by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287. It was built at the rear of the church constructed by Urban and the old choir area was removed in order to build the chapel. From this time on, it seemed as if the cathedral was in a constant state of repair or alterations at a slow pace. After the Lady Chapel had been completed, the two bays of the north choir aisle were rebuilt.

Severe damage was done to the church in 1400 during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr; his forces also destroyed the Bishop&#x27;s Palace at Llandaff. The damage was extensive enough to cause Bishop Blethyn to notify his fellow clergymen in 1575 that he believed the cathedral to possibly be damaged beyond repair. Most of the other damage was repaired, most notably by Bishop Marshall, whose reredos partly survives. The northwest tower, the one without a spire, was added by Jasper Tudor and is now named after him. He assumed the lordship of Cardiff after the accession to the throne of his nephew, King Henry VII of England.

Late medieval tombs include that of Sir David Mathew of Llandaff (1400–1484). Sir David ap Mathew was appointed &quot;Grand Standard Bearer of England&quot;, by King Edward IV, for saving his life at the Battle of Towton 1461 during the Wars of the Roses.

===Post-medieval to Victorian period===

During the English Civil War, the cathedral was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized the books of the cathedral library, taking them to Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Among those invited to the castle to warm themselves by the fire on that cold winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, who claimed to be a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part of it as a stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.

The southwest tower suffered major damage in the Great Storm of 1703 and by 1720, was in a state of collapse. The damage to the cathedral was so extensive that the church seriously considered removal of the see to Cardiff in 1717. Thomas Hancorne, a jacobite prominent in High Church circles, was prebendary of Llandaff from 1718 to 1731. Between 1720 and 1723 a series of storms damaged the cathedral further, bringing down sections of the roof. The collapse of 1723 forced worship services to be confined to the Lady Chapel and closed the western entrance of the cathedral entirely.

Thirty years after the cathedral roof collapsed, the chapter asked an architect, John Wood, the Elder, to prepare estimates and plans to restore the cathedral. In 1734 work began on a new cathedral, designed by Wood. Wood produced an Italian temple style edifice, working only on the eastern portion of the building, while leaving the remaining western half in ruins. What Wood was trying to build at Llandaff was not Italian, but a recreation of Solomon&#x27;s Temple. Another sixteen years passed before the chapter solicited funds to repair the western half of the building. Wood&#x27;s plans were to replace the western entrance of the cathedral with a tower and rustic porch. No changes were made to the western entrance until Wyatt and Prichard began their work in 1841, when the damage to the western portion of the structure was repaired and all traces of the Italian temple work by Wood had been removed from the cathedral.

During the 19th century the bishop began to reside in Llandaff for the first time in centuries; no bishops of the see resided in Llandaff for almost 300 years. In 1836 there was another unsuccessful attempt to transfer the see—this time to Bristol. After the attempt at transferring the see, the office of Dean was restored to Llandaff; the position had not been filled in 700 years. The office of Dean was separated from that of the Archdeacon of Llandaff in November 1843. The restoration of the Dean&#x27;s office was the beginning of better times for the cathedral. The new Dean, William Bruce Knight, was instrumental in bringing about the much-needed restorations.

Enough restoration had been completed to allow the cathedral to be reopened for worship on 16 April 1857. The see of Gloucester lent their cathedral choir for this service, making it possible to hear choral music in Llandaff Cathedral for the first time since 1691. The restoration done up to this point was to remove all traces of the Italian temple and to repair damages caused by the attempt to transform the cathedral by Wood. Arches with beautiful moulding were hidden by walls, Sedilia were removed from their original positions and reredos had been covered with plaster or hidden with walls.

A meeting was held after the service and a detailed restoration plan was announced at the meeting along with a list for those wishing to donate to the work. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute were among those who pledged donations sufficient to allow the restoration work to continue immediately. The cathedral was extensively restored, the tower rebuilt and a spire added. Much of the restoration work was completed by local architect John Prichard between 1843 and 1869. A triptych by Dante Gabriel Rossetti was designed for use as a reredos, and a new stained glass window, &quot;Shipwreck of St Paul&quot;, was designed by Ford Madox Brown. Sir Edward Burne-Jones designed the porcelain panels &quot;Six Days of Creation&quot; in St Dyfrig&#x27;s Chapel.

From 1691 until around 1860 there had been no choir at the cathedral. There was also no organ for some time. Browne Willis&#x27; 1719 account describes the ruins of an organ given to the cathedral by Lady Kemysh of Cefn Mably found in the organ loft at that time. In 1860, Alfred Ollivant, who was then Bishop of Landaff, published a book, &quot;Some Account of the Condition of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral, from 1575 to the present time&quot;, intended to raise funds to restore the cathedral&#x27;s choir and to purchase a new organ.
A cathedral school of some type has existed since the 9th century. Dean Vaughan reorganised the school in 1888. Since 1978 the cathedral school has accepted female pupils.

===20th and 21st centuries===
On the evening of 2 January 1941, during the Cardiff Blitz in the Second World War, a parachute mine was dropped nearby. When it exploded, it blew the roof off the nave, south aisle and chapter house. The top of the spire also had to be reconstructed and there was also some damage to the organ. The Sunday after the bombing, worship took place in the Deanery. Work soon began to clear the Lady Chapel and the Sanctuary and to repair the roof in these areas. This was not completed until April 1942. Further work was not possible until the end of the war, and the repaired areas served as a place of worship until 1957. Of British cathedrals, only Coventry Cathedral was damaged more, during the infamous Coventry Blitz. Due to its importance, the cathedral was given Grade I building status on 12 February 1952.

Major restorations and reconfigurations were carried out under architect George Pace of York, and the building was back in use in June 1958. Elizabeth II attended a service celebrating the completion of the restoration on 6 August 1960. The Welch Regiment Memorial Chapel was constructed, and Jacob Epstein created the figure of Christ in Majesty which is raised above the nave on a concrete arch designed by George Pace.

Pace presented two options to replace the pulpitum which was not part of the cathedral restoration done earlier by Pritchard. One was for a baldacchino having four columns with a suitable painting beneath it. The other was for a double wishbone arch topped by a hollow drum to house the division of the organ. The figure of &quot;Christ in Glory&quot; would be installed on the west face of the drum. This proposal was accepted by the Dean and the cathedral chapter. They approached the War Damage Commission about whether funds initially meant for replacement of stained glass damaged in the bombing could be used for art in other media. This permission helped to finance the &quot;Majestas&quot; figure.

In February 2007 the cathedral suffered a severe lightning strike. Particular damage was caused to the electrics of the organ, which was already in poor condition. The instrument was not able to be used after the lightning damage. This prompted the 2007 launch of an appeal to raise £1.5 million for the construction of an entirely new organ.

==Architecture==

The original pre-Norman church was recorded in the 12th-century Book of Llandaff to have been no more than long, wide and high. It contained low, narrow aisles with an apsidal &quot;porticus&quot; measuring long. Construction began of a grander building under the orders of the second Norman bishop of Llandaff, Urban, in the 1120s, to administer power over the newly formed diocese. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have lasted long as an extensive construction was ordered between 1193 and 1218 during the episcopate of Henry of Abergavenny. The western parts replaced those that Urban had built, and the nave and front of this side remain today. The fine craftsmanship and subtlety of the architecture show a clear similarity to those of Glastonbury Abbey and Wells Cathedral, so it is probable that several of the leading craftsman of Somerset were hired for the building.

Though some remodelling work was done in the 13th and 14th centuries, with a northwest tower funded by Jasper Tudor, lord of Glamorgan from 1484 to 1495, by the late 16th century the church had fallen into a state of disrepair. In 1594 the bishop complained that the cathedral was &quot;more like a desolate and profane place than like a house of prayer and holy exercises&quot;. The church continued to exist in a poor state, so that by 1692 choral services had to be suspended in fear that the roof would collapse. The battlements of the northwestern tower blew away during a storm in 1703, and the southwest tower fell down in 1722. In 1734, John Wood of Bath was hired to restore the cathedral, but his work on the temple was still not complete by 1752 and remained that way. It was not until 1840, in the wake of industrial development in Cardiff, that the cathedral could raise the funds to commence a full restoration.

T. H. Wyatt was hired to restore the Lady Chapel in 1841, but due to other commitments later left much of the work to John Prichard, who worked the most extensively on the church in the 1840s and 1850s. Prichard had restored the sanctuary by 1850, and by 1852 he had begun to work on the nave, largely demolishing the temple Wood had built. Together with London-based John Pollard Seddon, who was able to hire pre-Raphaelite artists Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Thomas Woolner, extensive developments were made. Morris &amp; Co. provided the stained glass in the 1860s. Prichard was responsible for a dramatic redevelopment of the southwest tower in 1867–1869, aided by a number of talented artists and craftsmen.

In 1941, a parachute mine exploded near the south aisle of the cathedral, resulting in the roof of the nave collapsing and the shattering of the windows. Charles Nicholson was hired to rebuild the roof, and made the decision to remove the altarpiece that Rossetti had added to the north aisle. In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the dean at the time, Glyn Simon, saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.

The material of the church which remains from the medieval period is primarily Somerset Dundry stone, though Sutton stone and local blue lias also make up the stonework, with the latter constituting most of the stonework dating from the post-Reformation period. The work done on the church since World War II is primarily of concrete and Pennant sandstone. The roofs, added in the post-war period, are made of Welsh slate and lead. The West front of the cathedral is gabled along its length and contains the grand central doorway, higher in level than the floor of the nave. It is described as being &quot;double lobed&quot; with an &quot;arched head with continuous chamfer outline, colonnettes and dripmould&quot;.

The south side of the nave is characterised by eight bays with stepped buttresses between them, with aisle windows featuring reticulated heads. At the side of the south aisle of the sanctuary is the Chapter House, a small, two-storey square building. It dates to the mid 13th century and is made from Chipping Campden and Bath limestone, with some local red sandstone from Radyr. The octagonal roof was the brainchild of Prichard, though it was lowered in pitch by Pace and later worked on by Donald Buttress. The buttresses of the building are made from ashlar. The seven stained-glass roundels are of 16th-century Flemish origin. In the interior is a pulpit featuring Moses. Also of note is the St David&#x27;s Chapel, added by George Pace in 1953–1956, which is accessed through the Norman north door of the cathedral.

==Music==

=== Choirs ===
For many years, the cathedral had the traditional Anglican choir of boys and men, and more recently the Girl Choristers. The boys and girls are educated at the Cathedral School, the only dedicated choir school in the Church in Wales, .

The Cathedral Choir consists of boys and alto, tenor and bass parts, and sing on Sundays at the Choral Eucharist and at Choral Evensong. The full choir also sings on Thursdays for Evensong, with the boys singing alone on Tuesdays and the lower voices on Fridays. The Girl Choristers and Schola Cantorum keep the choral tradition going through the week, with full SATB services for Evensong on Mondays and Wednesdays, directed by the Master of Choristers of the Cathedral School. The Girl Choristers occasionally sing with the Cathedral Choir, and have sung at large services, including a National Service of Remembrance, on Remembrance Sunday in 2018.

In addition, the parish choir sings at the weekly Parish Eucharist, and is a mixed choir of boys, girls, men and women. The cathedral has a ring of twelve bells (with an additional &quot;flat sixth&quot;, to make thirteen in total) hung for change-ringing, located in the Jasper tower. The current bells were installed in 1992, replacing a previous ring of ten. Only one other church in Wales has a ring of twelve bells; the cathedral is the only church in Cardiff with a set of twelve bells.

In December 2013, five days before Christmas, the cathedral chapter announced that all salaried adult members of the choir (altos, tenors and basses) were being made redundant, along with the assistant organist. The cathedral was in the midst of a financial crisis, and the chapter intended to save £45,000 a year by taking these measures.

=== Recordings ===
In 2012 the cathedral premiered its own record label, with a recording called &quot;Majestas&quot;. The music focuses on the new cathedral organ and the Llandaff Cathedral choir. The recording&#x27;s title was taken from the Jacob Epstein sculpture in the cathedral&#x27;s nave that was part of the post-war renewal of the structure. Proceeds from sales of the record were donated to African charities.

In August 2018, a recording of the 2010–13 Nicholson Organ was released. The organ is played by the Director of Music, Stephen Moore, and is called &quot;Deo Gracias&quot;.

In December 2018, the cathedral launched a recording of its Cathedral Choir called &quot;Nadolig yn Llandaf&quot;, showcasing seasonal music for Advent to Christmas. This was the first CD of the cathedral&#x27;s choir since &quot;Majestas&quot; in 2012.

=== Organs ===

==== Main organs ====
The first organ at Llandaff was built in 1861 by Gray and Davison. In the late 1800s, this organ was antiquated, and its pipes were moved to St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Usk.

The second organ was built in 1900 by Hope-Jones with Norman and Beard. This organ was rebuilt in 1937 by Hill, Norman and Beard. It received significant renovations by its builders after wartime damage to the cathedral; it was never entirely satisfactory from this point onwards, even before a 2007 lightning strike made it unusable. Originally it had been planned to install a new organ at that time, but the costs of about £1,000,000 were deemed to be too high in the austere climate of post-war Britain.

Organ manufacturer Nicholson &amp; Co Ltd began installation of a new organ in autumn 2008 and although not fully completed, it was brought to a playable stage by Easter 2010. Its inaugural performance was the Gloria of Louis Vierne&#x27;s Messe solennelle, performed at the Easter Vigil service on 3 April 2010. Proceeds from the 2011 Llandaff Festival of Music were donated to the cathedral for the completion of the new organ. The remaining stops were added in the late summer of 2013. It was the first entirely new organ for a British cathedral since the Coventry installation in the 1960s.

==== Lady Chapel organs ====
Two chamber organs have been used in the Lady Chapel at the east end of the cathedral. The first, built in 1946 by Hill, Norman and Beard, had two manuals and pedals. This was replaced in 1960 with a single manual chamber organ built by Henry Willis &amp; Sons, which remains there today.

<doc id="98663" wikidata="Q272626" url="?curid=98663" title="Orbital elements">
<text>Orbital elements are the parameters required to uniquely identify a specific orbit. In celestial mechanics these elements are considered in two-body systems using a Kepler orbit. There are many different ways to mathematically describe the same orbit, but certain schemes are commonly used in astronomy and orbital mechanics.

A real orbit and its elements change over time due to gravitational perturbations by other objects and the effects of general relativity. A Kepler orbit is an idealized, mathematical approximation of the orbit at a particular time.

When viewed from an inertial frame, two orbiting bodies trace out distinct trajectories. Each of these trajectories has its focus at the common center of mass. When viewed from a non-inertial frame centered on one of the bodies, only the trajectory of the opposite body is apparent; Keplerian elements describe these non-inertial trajectories. An orbit has two sets of Keplerian elements depending on which body is used as the point of reference. The reference body (usually the most massive) is called the &quot;primary&quot;, the other body is called the &quot;secondary&quot;. The primary does not necessarily possess more mass than the secondary, and even when the bodies are of equal mass, the orbital elements depend on the choice of the primary.

Orbital elements can be obtained from orbital state vectors (position and velocity vectors along with time and magnitude of acceleration) by manual transformations or with computer software through a process known as orbit determination.

It non-closed orbits exist, although these are typically referred to as trajectories and not orbits, as they are not periodic. The same elements used to describe closed orbits can also typically be used to represent open trajectories.

== Common orbital elements by type ==

=== Required parameters ===
In general, eight parameters are necessary to unambiguously define an arbitrary and unperturbed orbit. This is because the problem contains eight degrees of freedom. These correspond to the three spatial dimensions which define position (&#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot; in a Cartesian coordinate system), the velocity in each of these dimensions, the magnitude of acceleration (only magnitude is needed, as the direction is always opposite the position vector), and the current time (epoch). The mass or standard gravitational parameter of the central body can specified instead of the acceleration, as one can be used to find the other given the position vector through the relation formula_1. These parameters can be described as orbital state vectors, but this is often an inconvenient and opaque way to represent an orbit, which is why orbital elements are commonly used instead.

When describing an orbit with orbital elements, typically two are needed to describe the size and shape of the trajectory, three are needed describe the rotation of the orbit, one is needed to describe the speed of motion, and two elements are needed to describe the position of the body around its orbit along with the epoch time at which this occurs. However, if the epoch time is chosen to be the time at which the position-describing element of choice (e.g. mean anomaly) is equal to some constant (usually zero), then said element can be omitted, meaning only seven elements are required in total.

Commonly only 6 variables are specified for a given orbit, as the motion-describing variable can be the mass or standard gravitational parameter of the central body, which is often already known and does not need specifying, and the epoch time can be considered part of the reference frame and not as a distinct element. However, in any case, 8 values will need to be known, regardless of how they are categorized.

Additionally, certain elements can be omitted if they are not required for the desired application (e.g. both epoch elements and the motion element are not needed if only the shape and orientation need to be known).

=== Size and shape describing parameters ===
Two parameters are required to describe the size and the shape of an orbit. Generally any two of these values can be used to calculate any other (as described below), so the choice of which to use is one of preference and the particular use case.

* Eccentricity (&quot;&quot;) — shape of the ellipse, describing how much it deviates from a perfect a circle. An eccentricity of zero describes a perfect circle, values less than 1 describe an ellipse, values greater than 1 describe a hyperbolic trajectory, and a value of exactly 1 describes a parabola.
* Semi-major axis (&quot;&quot;) — half the distance between the apoapsis and periapsis (long axis of the ellipse). This value is positive for elliptical orbits, infinity for parabolic trajectories, and negative for hyperbolic trajectories, which can hinder its usability when working with different types of trajectories.
* Semi-minor axis (&quot;&quot;) — half the short axis of the ellipse. This value shares the same limitations as with the semi-major axis.
* Semi-parameter (&#x27;) — the width of the orbit at the primary focus (at a true anomaly of &#x27; or 90°). This value is useful for its use in the orbit equation, which can return the distance from the central body given &#x27; and the true anomaly for any type of orbit or trajectory. This value is also commonly referred to as the semi-latus rectum, and given the symbol &#x27;. Additionally, this value will always be defined and positive unlike the semi-major and semi-minor axes.
* Apoapsis () — The farthest point in the orbit from the central body (at a true anomaly of &quot;&quot; or 180°). This quantity is undefined (or infinity) for parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories, as they continue moving away from the central body forever. This value is sometimes given the symbol &quot;.&quot;
* Periapsis () — The closest point in the orbit from the central body (at a true anomaly of 0). Unlike with apoapsis, this quantity is defined for all orbit types. This value is sometimes given the symbol &quot;.&quot;

It is worth mentioning that for perfectly circular orbits, there are no points on the orbit that can be described as either the apoapsis or periapsis, as they all have the same distance from the central body. Additionally it is common to see the affix for apoapsis and periapsis changed depending on the central body (e.g. apogee and perigee for orbits of the Earth, and aphelion and perihelion for orbits of the Sun).

Other parameters can also be used to describe the size and shape of an orbit such as the linear eccentricity, flattening, and focal parameter, but the use of these is limited.

==== Relations between elements ====

This section contains the common relations between these orbital elements, but more relations can be derived through manipulations of one or more of these equations. The variable names used here are consistent with the ones described above.

Eccentricity can be found using the semi-minor and semi-major axes like so:formula_2 when formula_3, formula_4 when formula_5

Eccentricity can also be found using the apoapsis and periapsis through this relation:formula_6

The semi-major axis can be found using the fact that the line that connects the apoapsis to the center of the conic, and from the center to the periapsis both combined span the length of the conic, and thus the major axis. This is then divided by 2 to get the semi-major axis.formula_7

The semi-minor axis can be found using the semi-major axis and eccentricity through the following relations. Two formula are needed to avoid taking the square root of a negative number.formula_8 when formula_9, formula_10 when formula_11

The semi-parameter can be found using the semi-major axis and eccentricity like so:formula_12

Apoapsis can be found using the following equation, which is a form of the orbit equation solved for formula_13.formula_14 , when formula_9

Periapsis can be found using the following equation, which, as with the equation for apoapsis, is a form of the orbit equation instead solved for formula_16.formula_17

=== Rotation describing elements ===

Three parameters are required to describe the orientation of the plane of the orbit, and the orientation of the orbit within that plane.

* Inclination (&#x27;) — vertical tilt of the ellipse with respect to the reference plane, typically the equator of the central body, measured at the ascending node (where the orbit passes crosses the reference plane, represented by the green angle &#x27; in the diagram). Inclinations near zero indicate equatorial orbits, and inclinations near 90° indicate polar orbits. Inclinations from 90 to 180° are typically used to denote retrograde orbits.
* Longitude of the ascending node () — describes the angle from the ascending node of the orbit ( in the diagram) to the reference frame&#x27;s reference direction (♈︎ in the diagram). This is measured in the reference plane, and is shown as the green angle in the diagram. This quantity is undefined for perfectly equatorial (coplanar) orbits, but is often set to zero instead by convention. This quantity is also sometimes referred to as the right ascension of the ascending node (or RAAN).
* Argument of periapsis (&#x27;) — defines the orientation of the ellipse in the orbital plane, as an angle measured from the ascending node to the periapsis (the closest point the satellite body comes to the primary body around which it orbits), the purple angle &#x27; in the diagram. This quantity is undefined for circular orbits, but is often set to zero instead by convention.

These three elements together can be described as Euler angles defining the orientation of the orbit relative to the reference coordinate system. Although these three are the most common, other elements do exist, and are useful to describe other properties of the orbit.

* Longitude of periapsis () — describes the angle between the vernal point and the periapsis, measured in the reference plane. This can be described as the sum of the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of periapsis: formula_18. Unlike the longitude of the ascending node, this value is defined for orbits where the inclination is zero.

=== Motion over time describing elements ===
One parameter is required to describe the speed of motion of the orbiting object around the central body. However, this can be omitted if only a description of the shape of the orbit is required. Various quantities that do not directly describe a speed can be used to satisfy this condition, and it is possible to convert from one to any other (formula below).

* Mean motion (&quot;) — quantity that describes the average angular speed of the orbiting body, measured as an angle per unit time. For non-circular orbits, the actual angular speed is not constant, so the mean motion will not describe a physical angle. Instead this corresponds to a change in the mean anomaly, which indeed increases linearly with time.
* Orbital period (&quot;) — the time it takes for the orbiting body to complete one full revolution around the central body. This quantity is undefined for parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories, as they are non-periodic.
* Standard gravitational parameter (&#x27;) — quantity equal to the mass of the central body times the gravitational constant &#x27;. This quantity is often used instead of mass, as it can be easier to measure with precision than either mass or &quot;, and will need to be calculated in any case in order to find the acceleration due to gravity. This is also often not included as part of orbital element lists, as it can assumed to be known based on the central body.
* Mass of the central body (&quot;) — the mass of only the central body can be used, as in most cases the mass of the orbiting body is insignificant and does not meaningfully influence the trajectory. However, when this is not the case (e.g. binary stars), the mass of the 2-body system can be used instead.

==== Relations between elements ====
This section contains the common relations between the set of orbital elements described above, but more relations can be derived through manipulations of one or more of these equations. The variable names used here are consistent with the ones described above.

Mean motion can be calculated using the standard gravitational parameter and the semi-major axis of the orbit (&#x27; can be substituted for ). This equation returns the mean motion in radians, and will need to be converted if &#x27; is desired to be in a different unit.formula_19 when formula_3, formula_21 when formula_5

It is worth noting that because the semi-major axis is related to the mean motion and standard gravitational parameter, it can be calculated without being specified. This is especially useful if &#x27; is assumed to be known, as then &#x27; can be used to calculate &#x27;, and likewise for specifying &#x27;. This can allow one less element to specified.

Orbital period can be found from &#x27; given the fact that the mean motion can be described as a frequency (number of orbits per unit time), which is the inverse of period.formula_23if &#x27; is in radians, or formula_24 if &quot; is in degrees.

The standard gravitational parameter can be found given the mean motion and the semi-major axis through the following relation (assuming that &quot; is in radians):formula_25

The mass of the central body can be found given the standard gravitational parameter using a rearrangement of its definition as the product of the mass and the gravitational constant.formula_26

=== Epoch describing elements ===
Two elements are needed to describe the position of the body around its orbit, and the time at which this occurs. If this time is defined to be at a point where the specific position variable is a designated constant (usually zero), then it does not need to be specified.

* Epoch () — time at which one of the below elements is defined. Alternatively this is the point in time where the orbital elements were measured. Sometimes the epoch time is considered as part of the reference frame and is not listed as a distinct element.
* Time of periapsis passage (&quot;&quot;) — time at which the orbiting body is at periapsis. This is also when the mean anomaly and true anomaly (and others) are zero, so they do not need to be defined. This value is not defined for circular orbits, as they do not have a uniquely defined point of periapsis.
* Mean anomaly at epoch () — mean anomaly at the epoch time. Mean anomaly is a mathematically convenient angle that increases linearly with time as if the orbit were perfectly circular. Zero is defined as being at periapsis, and one period spans 2&#x27; radians. The rate at which the mean anomaly increases is equal to the mean motion &#x27;. Because this angle is relative to periapsis, it is not defined for circular orbits.
* Mean longitude at epoch () — mean longitude at the epoch time. Mean longitude is similar to mean anomaly, in that it increases linearly with time and does not represent the real angular displacement. Unlike with mean anomaly, mean longitude is defined relative to the vernal point, which means it is defined for circular orbits.
* Eccentric anomaly at epoch () — the eccentric anomaly at the epoch time. Eccentric anomaly is defined at the angular displacement along the auxiliary circle of the ellipse (circle tangent to the ellipse both at apses). This value takes into account the varying speed of objects in elliptical orbits, but does not account for the elliptical shape of the orbit. As such, it still does not correspond to the real angular displacement of the orbiting body. Like with mean anomaly and true anomaly, the eccentric anomaly is measured relative to periapsis, and is not defined for circular orbits. The eccentric anomaly is also not defined for parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories, and instead the parabolic anomaly or hyperbolic anomaly are used.
* True anomaly at epoch (formula_27) — angle that represents the real angular displacement of the orbiting body at the epoch time, taking into account the varying speed and elliptical shape of an orbit. Like with mean anomaly, true anomaly is measured relative to periapsis, and thus it has the same limitations with circular orbits.
* True longitude at epoch () — the angular displacement of the orbiting body at the epoch time. Unlike with the true anomaly, the true longitude is measured relative to the vernal point, so it can be defined for circular orbits.
* Mean argument of latitude () at epoch — the angular displacement of the orbiting body at the epoch time. Mean argument of latitude is similar to the mean anomaly and mean longitude, but instead it is measured relative to the ascending node. This means while it is well defined for circular orbits, it is not for equatorial orbits.
* Argument of latitude at epoch () — the angular displacement of the orbiting body at the epoch time. This angle is measured relative to the ascending node, so while it is defined for circular orbits, it is not defined for equatorial orbits.
It is worth mentioning that these elements are also used to describe the position of an object in its orbit in a more general context, and are not limited to describing the state at an epoch time.

==== Relations between elements ====
This section contains the common relations between the set of orbital elements described above, but more relations can be derived through manipulations of one or more of these equations. The variable names used here are consistent with the ones described above. These formulae also hold true for conversions between these elements in general.

Epoch can be found given the time of periapsis passage, the mean anomaly at epoch, and mean motion like so:formula_28

Time of periapsis passage can be found from the epoch, mean anomaly at epoch, and mean motion by re-arranging the previous equation like so:formula_29

Mean anomaly can be found from the eccentric anomaly and eccentricity using Kepler&#x27;s equation like so:formula_30

Mean longitude can be found using the mean anomaly at epoch and the longitude of periapsis.formula_31 or formula_32

Eccentric anomaly can be found with the mean anomaly and eccentricity using Kepler&#x27;s equation through various means, such as iterative calculations or numerical solutions (for some values of ). Kepler&#x27;s equation is given asformula_33,

and can be solved through a root-finding algorithm (usually Newton&#x27;s Method) like so:formula_34

Typically a starting guess of either formula_35, formula_36, formula_37, or formula_38 are used. This iteration can be repeated until a desired level of tolerance is reached.

True anomaly can be found from the eccentric anomaly and through the following relations. The quadrant of the solution can be resolved using an atan2(y,x) function.formula_39

True longitude can be found using the true anomaly and longitude of periapsis through the following relation:formula_40 or formula_41

Mean argument of latitude can be calculated using the mean anomaly and argument of periapsis like so:formula_42

Argument of latitude can be found using the true anomaly and argument of periapsis like so:formula_43

== Common sets of elements ==

=== Classical Keplerian elements ===
While in theory, any set of elements that meets the requirements above can be used to describe an orbit, in practice, certain sets are much more common than others.

The most common elements used to describe the size and shape of the orbit are the semi-major axis (), and the eccentricity (). Sometimes the semi-parameter () is used instead of , as the semi-major axis is infinite for parabolic trajectories, and thus cannot be used.

It is common to specify the period () or mean motion () instead of the semi-major axis in Keplerian element sets, as each can be computed from the other provided the standard gravitational parameter (formula_44) is known for the central body though the relations above.

For the epoch, the epoch time () along with the mean anomaly (), mean longitude (), true anomaly (formula_27) or (rarely) the eccentric anomaly () are often used. The time of periapsis passage () is also sometimes used for this purpose.

It is also quite common to see either the mean anomaly or the mean longitude expressed directly, without either or as intermediary steps, as a linear function of time. This method of expression will consolidate the mean motion as the slope of this linear equation. An example of this is provided below:formula_46

=== Elements by body type ===
The choice of elements can differ depending on the type of astronomical body. The eccentricity (&#x27;) and either the semi-major axis (&#x27;) or the distance of periapsis (&#x27;) are used to specify the shape and size of an orbit. The longitude of the ascending node () the inclination (&#x27;) and the argument of periapsis (&#x27;) or the longitude of periapsis (&#x27;) specify the orientation of the orbit in its plane. Either the Mean longitude at epoch () the mean anomaly at epoch () or the time of periapsis passage () are used to specify a known point in the orbit. The choices made depend whether the vernal equinox or the node are used as the primary reference.
=== Two-line elements ===
Orbital elements can be encoded as text in a number of formats. The most common of them is the NASA / NORAD &quot;two-line elements&quot; (TLE) format, originally designed for use with 80 column punched cards, but still in use because it is the most common format, and 80-character ASCII records can be handled efficiently by modern databases.

The two-line element format lists the eccentricity (), inclination (), longitude of the ascending node (), argument of periapsis (&#x27;), mean motion (&#x27;), epoch (), and mean anomaly at epoch (). Since the format is primarily meant for orbits of the Earth, the standard gravitational parameter (&quot;&quot;), can be assumed and used to calculate the semi-major axis with the mean motion via the relation above.

Depending on the application and object orbit, the data derived from TLEs older than 30 days can become unreliable. Orbital positions can be calculated from TLEs through simplified perturbation models (SGP4 / SDP4 / SGP8 / SDP8).

Example of a two-line element:

=== Delaunay variables ===
The Delaunay orbital elements were introduced by Charles-Eugène Delaunay during his study of the motion of the Moon. Commonly called &quot;Delaunay variables&quot;, they are a set of canonical variables, which are action-angle coordinates. The angles are simple sums of some of the Keplerian angles, and are often referred to with different symbols than other in applications like so:

* the mean longitude: formula_47,
* the longitude of periapsis: formula_48, and
* the longitude of the ascending node: formula_49

along with their respective conjugate momenta, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;. The momenta &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; are the &quot;action&quot; variables and are more elaborate combinations of the Keplerian elements &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;&quot;.

Delaunay variables are used to simplify perturbative calculations in celestial mechanics, for example while investigating the Kozai–Lidov oscillations in hierarchical triple systems. The advantage of the Delaunay variables is that they remain well defined and non-singular (except for &quot;, which can be tolerated) even for circular and equatorial orbits.

== Euler angle transformations ==
The angles , &#x27;, &#x27; are the Euler angles (corresponding to &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot; in the notation used in that article) characterizing the orientation of the coordinate system

where:

* &#x27;, &#x27; is in the equatorial plane of the central body. &#x27; is in the direction of the vernal equinox. &#x27; is perpendicular to &#x27; and with &#x27; defines the reference plane. is perpendicular to the reference plane. Orbital elements of bodies (planets, comets, asteroids, ...) in the Solar System usually the ecliptic as that plane.
* &#x27;, &#x27; are in the orbital plane and with &#x27; in the direction to the pericenter (periapsis). &#x27; is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. &#x27; is mutually perpendicular to &#x27; and .

Then, the transformation from the &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; coordinate frame to the &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; frame with the Euler angles , &#x27;, &#x27; is: formula_50 formula_51 where formula_52

The inverse transformation, which computes the 3 coordinates in the I-J-K system given the 3 (or 2) coordinates in the x-y-z system, is represented by the inverse matrix. According to the rules of matrix algebra, the inverse matrix of the product of the 3 rotation matrices is obtained by inverting the order of the three matrices and switching the signs of the three Euler angles.

That is,

formula_53 where formula_54

The transformation from &#x27;, &#x27;, to Euler angles , &#x27;, &#x27; is: formula_55 where {{math|arg(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;)}} signifies the polar argument that can be computed with the standard function {{mono|atan2(y,x)}} available in many programming languages.

== Perturbations and elemental variance ==
{{Main|Perturbation (astronomy)}}
Unperturbed, two-body, Newtonian orbits are always conic sections, so the Keplerian elements define an unchanging ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola. Real orbits have perturbations, so a given set of Keplerian elements accurately describes an orbit only at the epoch. Evolution of the orbital elements takes place due to the gravitational pull of bodies other than the primary, the non-sphericity of the primary, atmospheric drag, relativistic effects, radiation pressure, electromagnetic forces, and so on.

Keplerian elements can often be used to produce useful predictions at times near the epoch. Alternatively, real trajectories can be modeled as a sequence of Keplerian orbits that osculate (&quot;kiss&quot; or touch) the real trajectory. They can also be described by the so-called planetary equations, differential equations which come in different forms developed by Lagrange, Gauss, Delaunay, Poincaré, or Hill.

<doc id="98667" wikidata="Q5040533" url="?curid=98667" title="H. Carl McCall">
<text>Herman Carl McCall (born October 17, 1935) is an American politician of the Democratic Party. A former New York State Comptroller and New York State Senator, McCall was the Democratic nominee for Governor of New York in 2002. McCall was the first African-American to be elected New York State Comptroller. He is an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ, and is on the board of directors of several corporations. From October 17, 2011, until his retirement on June 30, 2019, McCall was chairman of the State University of New York Board of Trustees.

==Early life and education==
McCall was born in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the oldest of six children of Herman McCall and Caroleasa Ray. Herman McCall moved to Boston from Georgia and worked as a railroad porter; he abandoned the family when Carl was 11 years of age. Thereafter, the family was supported primarily by welfare and by relatives due to Carl&#x27;s mother&#x27;s infirmity. McCall graduated from Roxbury Memorial High School in Boston, where he was president of his class. He attended Dartmouth College on private and ROTC scholarships, graduating in 1958 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in government. McCall was also educated at the University of Edinburgh and received a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) Degree from Andover Newton Theological School.

==Early career==
During the 1960s, McCall worked as a high school teacher and a bank manager. He taught for six months at Jamaica Plain High School on Sumner Hill in Boston, and then joined the Army. He opened a church in the Dorchester neighborhood. By the late 1960s, McCall had moved to New York City. He was appointed by New York Mayor John Lindsay to head the Commission Against Poverty.

==Political career==
During the 1970s, McCall, as a member of the Harlem Clubhouse, backed by the Harlem political power of Percy Sutton, was elected to three terms as a State Senator representing Harlem and the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1975 to 1980, sitting in the 181st, 182nd and 183rd New York State Legislatures. He left the Senate to accept an appointment from President Jimmy Carter as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations with the rank of Ambassador.

In 1982, McCall was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of New York. Governor Mario Cuomo then appointed McCall to serve as the state&#x27;s Commissioner of Human Rights (1983–84). While in the private sector as a vice president for governmental relations with Citicorp (1985–93), McCall accepted an appointment to the New York City Board of Education, where he was President of the Board from 1991 to 1993.

===New York State Comptroller===
In 1993, McCall was selected by the New York State Legislature to fill the unexpired term of Republican Edward Regan as state comptroller. As comptroller, McCall was responsible for serving as the state&#x27;s chief fiscal officer, conducting audits of state and local entities, serving as the state&#x27;s bookkeeper, investing the state&#x27;s funds, overseeing the state&#x27;s debt issuances, and serving as the sole trustee of the state pension fund.

McCall was elected to a full term as comptroller in 1994 (defeating Conservative Herbert London) and was re-elected in 1998 (defeating Republican Bruce Blakeman). In 1998, he announced that he would not seek election to the U.S. Senate in 2000, helping to pave the way for the successful candidacy of Hillary Clinton.

Al Sharpton was quoted as saying that &quot;if David Dinkins has a cold in the black community, Carl McCall has pneumonia&quot;, and it has been said that McCall was a &quot;stiff, bourgeois figure&quot; who generally did not excite the black electorate.

===2002 campaign for Governor of New York===
In 2002, McCall officially announced his campaign against Republican incumbent George Pataki. After his primary opponent, former US Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, withdrew from the race, McCall entered the general election as the uncontested Democratic candidate, but lost to Pataki. McCall remains New York state&#x27;s highest-ranking black elected official and first black major party gubernatorial candidate.

McCall was the favorite of the Democratic establishment, but he faced a tough challenge from Cuomo which almost split the party. Cuomo proved to be a better fundraiser, and McCall&#x27;s own campaign war chest was heavily depleted in the primary battle. Although McCall himself did not make any negative attacks, his close supporter, US Congressman Charles B. Rangel, stated that the McCall camp would not necessarily endorse Cuomo in the general election should the latter win. This backfired as some Italian-Americans interpreted that as racism, and many of Cuomo&#x27;s supporters refused to unite behind McCall after McCall won the nomination. McCall was endorsed by Senator Chuck Schumer. While Senator Hillary Clinton did not officially take sides during the primary, she loaned a staffer and a fundraiser to McCall&#x27;s campaign and she marched by McCall&#x27;s side at the West Indian American Day parade in New York City, as the Clinton wanted to retain strong African-American support in case she made a presidential run in the future. Cuomo withdrew from the primary race after McCall moved to a double-digit lead in polls.

Money would prove to be a handicap in the general election, as DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe stated that he would not channel large sums of money to McCall&#x27;s campaign unless the gap could be closed with Pataki, which McCall never managed to do. In an unusual show of support, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh urged his listeners to donate to McCall&#x27;s campaign. Limbaugh said the refusal to give the McCall campaign money was a show of racism on the part of the DNC.

Charles Rangel suggested that Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s gubernatorial run in 2010 would undo years of work that Cuomo spent rebuilding his standing in the state Democratic Party after his bruising 2002 gubernatorial primary contest against Carl McCall. Rangel said &quot;it would be immoral for the white attorney general to challenge New York&#x27;s first black governor in a primary&quot; with the &quot;inclination for racial polarization in a primary in the state of New York. Since we have most African-Americans registered as Democrats, and since you would be making an appeal for Democrats, it would be devastating in my opinion&quot;. David Paterson, the incumbent and first African-American governor of New York, whom Rangel staunchly supported, fared poorly in polls due to several scandals and later abandoned his campaign re-election.

====Letterhead controversy====
In October 2002, McCall released 61 letters he had written on state letterhead to heads of companies in which the state pension fund owned large blocks of stock, asking them to review enclosed resumes of his relatives and other job-seekers.

Some of the letters referred to the size of the state&#x27;s ownership interest in the corporation targeted, which critics claimed amounted to a veiled threat to punish companies that didn&#x27;t hire his relatives. A Quinnipiac poll released October 16 showed that two-thirds of likely voters were aware of the letters and of those more than a fifth were less likely to vote for McCall as a result.

McCall defended the letters. Although he did issue a statement regretting the &quot;appearance&quot; and &quot;impression&quot; of the letters he wrote on government stationery, he maintained that he &quot;never sought to leverage my public position nor mix my government role with my personal and professional relationship&quot; in the letters. McCall&#x27;s daughter, Marci, was hired by Verizon, which received such a letter, but was subsequently fired for using her company credit card to pay for substantial personal expenditures. Charges of larceny against her were dropped after some reimbursement to Verizon, and she was then hired as a marketer by McCall&#x27;s running mate, Dennis Mehiel.

====Results====
McCall was defeated in the election for governor by the Republican incumbent, George Pataki. McCall received 33% of the vote, a low percentage for a Democratic nominee for statewide office in a state where the Democratic Party is by far the dominant party based on voter registrations. Some observers felt that this seemingly poor showing was in part due to the revelation of the above-referenced letters; others insinuated that McCall&#x27;s showing was related to racism, especially in upstate New York. However, others point out that Pataki was able to make crucial inroads into traditional areas of Democratic support, such as unions and even African-American congregations. The three-way vote-split efforts of Tom Golisano, who primarily ran against Pataki on his own third-party line, also diverted much of the anti-Pataki vote away from McCall.

Other political commentators attribute McCall&#x27;s defeat to the growing popularity of the Republican Party after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, along with Governor Pataki&#x27;s successful administration of the state.

==Later career==
McCall was a recent member of the Board of the New York Stock Exchange (1999–2003), as well as the Apollo Theater Foundation, Inc. Currently, he is a member of the Fiscal Control Board for Buffalo, New York as well as the SUNY Board of Trustees. He also is on the Boards of Directors for TYCO International, New Plan Realty, TAG Entertainment Corporation, Ariel Mutual Fund, and as Chair of the New York State Public Higher Education Conference Board. He spoke at his alma mater Dartmouth College&#x27;s annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in 2006 about modern civil rights and the legacy of Dr. King. He operates his own financial services fund called Convent Capital, LLC.

In January 2007, McCall was appointed to a panel, along with former New York State Comptroller Ned Regan and former New York City Comptroller Harrison Jay Goldin, to interview and recommend up to five candidates to the State Legislature to replace Alan Hevesi, who resigned as state comptroller due to scandal.

In May 2009, Convent Capital, the financial services firm run by McCall, was subpoenaed, along with other unregistered placement agents, by state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s office as part of an inquiry into possible corruption involved in deals brokered between investment firms and the state pension fund.

McCall joined the State University of New York Board of Trustees on October 22, 2007. He was appointed to the Board by Governor Spitzer. McCall was appointed chairman on October 17, 2011, by Governor Cuomo. He announced his retirement in April 2019, effective at the end of June. He was succeeded as chair by vice chair Merryl Tisch.

==Personal life==
McCall&#x27;s first marriage—to Cecilia McCall, the mother of his daughter Marcella (Marci)--ended in divorce. In 1983, McCall married his second wife, Joyce F. Brown; Brown is a former psychology professor, was a Deputy Mayor of New York City under Mayor David Dinkins, and is president of SUNY&#x27;s Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. They have no children.

McCall is a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Awards==
McCall is the recipient of nine honorary degrees. In 2003, he was awarded the Nelson Rockefeller Distinguished Public Service Award from the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy at the University of Albany.

On February 14, 2020, the SUNY Plaza administrative building was renamed to the H. Carl McCall SUNY Building in honor of McCall&#x27;s &quot;long standing contributions to SUNY and New York State.&quot;

<doc id="98668" wikidata="Q1373397" url="?curid=98668" title="James H. Clark">
<text>James Henry Clark (born March 23, 1944) is an American entrepreneur and computer scientist. He founded several notable Silicon Valley technology companies, including Silicon Graphics, Netscape, myCFO, and Healtheon. His research work in computer graphics led to the development of systems for the fast rendering of three-dimensional computer images.

In 1998, Clark was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for the development of computer graphics and for technical leadership in the computer industry.

==Early life and education==
Clark was born in Plainview, Texas, on March 23, 1944. He dropped out of high school at 16 and spent four years in the US Navy, where he was introduced to electronics. Clark began taking night courses at Tulane University&#x27;s University College where, despite his lack of a high school diploma, he was able to earn enough credits to be admitted to the University of New Orleans. There, Clark earned his bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s degrees in physics, followed by a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Utah in 1974.

==Career==

===Academia===
After completing his doctorate, Clark worked at the New York Institute of Technology&#x27;s Computer Graphics Lab. He served as an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz (1974-1978) before moving to Stanford University as an associate professor of electrical engineering (1979-1982). Clark&#x27;s research work concerned geometry pipelines, specialized software or hardware that accelerates the display of three dimensional images. The peak of his group&#x27;s advancements was the &quot;Geometry Engine&quot;, an early hardware accelerator for rendering computer images based on geometric models which he developed in 1979 with his students at Stanford.

===Silicon Graphics===
In 1982, Clark along with several Stanford graduate students founded Silicon Graphics (SGI). The earliest Silicon Graphics graphical workstations were mainly terminals, but they were soon followed by stand-alone graphical Unix workstations with very fast graphics rendering hardware. In the mid-1980s, Silicon Graphics began to use the MIPS CPU as the foundation of their newest workstations, replacing the Motorola 68000.

By 1991, Silicon Graphics had become the world leader in the production of Hollywood movie visual effects and 3-D imaging. Silicon Graphics focused on the high-end market where they could charge a premium for their special hardware and graphics software.

Clark had differences of opinion with Silicon Graphics management regarding the future direction of the company, and departed in late January 1994.

===Netscape===
In February 1994, Clark sought out Marc Andreessen who had led the development of Mosaic, the first widely distributed and easy-to-use software for browsing the World Wide Web, while employed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). Clark and Andreessen founded Netscape, and developed the Netscape Navigator web browser. The founding of Netscape and its IPO in August 1995 launched the Internet boom on Wall Street during the mid-to-late 1990s. Clark&#x27;s initial investment in Netscape was $4 million in 1994; he exited with $1.2 billion when Netscape was acquired by AOL in 1999.

===Healtheon/WebMD===
In 1995, Clark became interested in streamlining the paperwork associated with the health-care industry. The resulting start-up, Healtheon, was founded in early 1996 with backing from Kleiner Perkins and New Enterprise Associates. Although Clark&#x27;s original idea of eliminating the paperwork and bureaucracy associated with medical care was ambitious, it did lead to successes in administrative streamlining of medical records technology. However, an Atlanta, Georgia startup company, WebMD originally focused on medical content was also making similar in-roads. Knowing WebMD had financial backing from Microsoft, Clark decided to merge Healtheon with the original WebMD to form the WebMD Corporation (NASDAQ: WBMD). WebMD is a leader in health information on the Internet.

===Other affiliations===
In 1999, Clark launched myCFO, a company formed to help wealthy Silicon Valley individuals manage their fortunes. In late 2002, while Clark served on the board of directors, most of myCFO&#x27;s operations were sold to Harris Bank and now operate as &quot;Harris myCFO&quot;.

Clark was chairman and financial backer of network-security startup Neoteris, founded in 2000, which was acquired by NetScreen in 2003 and subsequently by Juniper Networks.

Clark was a founding director and investor in the biotechnology company DNA Sciences, founded in 1998 to unravel the genetics of common disease using volunteers recruited from the Internet launched August 1, 2000 (see The New York Times). In 2003, the company was acquired by Genaissance Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Clark was the subject of the 1999 bestseller &quot;The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story&quot; by U.S. author Michael Lewis.

Clark was a notable investor in Kibu.com, an Internet website for teens, which received approximately $22 million in funding. The website shut down in 2000, returning its remaining capital to investors.

Clark coproduced the 2009 movie &quot;The Cove&quot;. His funding made possible the purchase and covert installation of some high-tech camera and sound-recording equipment required to capture the film&#x27;s climactic dolphin slaughter. The film addresses the problem of whale and dolphin killing in Taiji, Wakayama, Japan.

Clark sits on the board and is one of the primary investors in the mobile technology company Ibotta. Ibotta became a publicly traded company in April 2024.

In 2017, Clark announced the launch of CommandScape, a cyber secure building management and automation platform.

In 2020, Clark announced the $30M A round of funding for Beyond Identity, with a product that is a phone-resident personal certificate-based authentication and authorization solution that eliminates all passwords.

==Awards==
Clark received the ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Achievement Award in 1984. In 1996, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was a recipient of the 1997 Kilby International Awards, which honored him for his computer graphics vision and for enabling networked information exchange.

In 1988, Clark was an Award Recipient of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Northern California Region.

Clark was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (ScD) from the University of East Anglia in 1998.

==Personal life==
Clark has been married four times and has four children. The divorce from his third wife of 15 years, Nancy Rutter, a Forbes journalist, is reported to have cost him $125 million in cash and assets in the settlement. Soon afterwards he began dating Australian model Kristy Hinze, 35 years his junior. Hinze became his fourth wife when they married in the British Virgin Islands on March 22, 2009. She gave birth to a daughter, Dylan Vivienne in September 2011, and later, Harper Hazelle, in August 2013. In 2000, his daughter by a previous marriage, Kathy, married Chad Hurley, a co-founder of YouTube, they were divorced in 2012.

In 2022 he made the largest residential real estate sale in Florida history, selling a 22-acre property in Manalapan, Florida to Larry Ellison for approximately $175 million. Clark had previously acquired the property in 2021 from the Ziff publishing family for $94 million.

==Yachting==
Clark is an enthusiastic yachtsman but cannot sail in rough ocean races such as the Sydney-Hobart due to an arthritic condition in his ankles and prefers one-day regattas on the smoother waters of the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and off Newport, Rhode Island. In 2012, however, he commented that &quot;after 28 years of owning boats, I&#x27;m over it.&quot;

He is the past owner of two important sailing yachts:
*&quot;Hyperion&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest sloop when she was launched in 1998 at in length. She was designed by Germán Frers and built by Royal Huisman. With an air draught of , she briefly featured the world&#x27;s longest carbon fiber spar. Clark developed her own chartplotter and SCADA system to control vessel operation remotely, as well as automate sailing operation and optimize sailing performance using a large bank of sensors and SGI processors. Clark sold &quot;Hyperion&quot; in 2004.
*&quot;Comanche&quot;, a carbonfiber maxi yacht designed by VPLP and built by Hodgdon Shipbuilding for line honours victories in offshore races. She lost line honours to &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; in the 2014 Sydney-Hobart race but returned and won in 2015. She also won line honours in the 2015 Transatlantic race in which she set a new 24-hour speed record for monohulls. In 2016 with Skipper Ken Read and Stan Honey navigating, she set the Newport to Bermuda Race record, shaving five hours off the previous fastest time recorded in the 635 mile race. In December 2017, &quot;Comanche&quot; was sold to Australian Jim Cooney.

He remains the current owner of two other large sailing yachts:
* &quot;Athena&quot;, a three-mast gaff-rigged aluminum schooner built by Royal Huisman. &quot;Athena&quot; has been listed for sale since July 2012, originally with an asking price of US$95 million, reduced to $59 million as of February 2017.
* &quot;Hanuman&quot;, a replica of the J-Class &quot;Endeavour II&quot;, built by Royal Huisman. &quot;Hanuman&quot; has been listed for sale since May 2012 with an asking price of US$14.9 million as of 2021.

==Flying==
Clark is a pilot who enjoys flying helicopters, gliders (built in Germany) and acrobatic aircraft (such as the Extra EA-300).

==Philanthropy==
Clark has contributed to Stanford University, where he was an associate electrical engineering professor. In 1999, he pledged $150 million toward construction of the James H. Clark Center for Biomedical Engineering and related programs for interdisciplinary biomedical research. At the time, it was the largest-ever contribution to Stanford, other than the university&#x27;s founding grant. Construction started in 2001 and was completed in the summer of 2003, as part of Stanford&#x27;s Bio-X program. In September 2001, Clark rescinded $60 million of his initial pledge, citing anger over President Bush&#x27;s restrictions on stem cell research. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion piece, Clark said federal funding is essential for research in the United States, and he was not interested in funding research that could be suppressed for political reasons. President Barack Obama lifted the restrictions in question in 2009. In 2013, Clark pledged an additional $60 million to Stanford for interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, technology, and engineering. His commitment was finally completely fulfilled in 2020. Clark has donated an additional $10 million to fund fellowships at the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics.

In 2004, Clark and David Filo of Yahoo! each donated $30 million to Tulane University&#x27;s School of Engineering for merit-based scholarships to provide education to deserving students regardless of financial situation in the discipline of engineering.

Clark is a board member for the national council of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and contributes towards the organization. The Perlman Music Program has recognized Clark for his continued philanthropic efforts towards their organization and their endowment fund.

<text>Paul Francis Conrad (June 27, 1924 – September 4, 2010) was an American political cartoonist and winner of three Pulitzer Prizes for editorial cartooning. In the span of a career lasting five decades, Conrad provided a critical perspective on eleven presidential administrations in the United States. He is best known for his work as the chief editorial cartoonist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; during a time when the newspaper was in transition under the direction of publisher Otis Chandler, who recruited Conrad from the &quot;Denver Post&quot;.

At the conservative &quot;Times&quot;, Conrad brought a more liberal editorial perspective that readers both celebrated and criticized; he was also respected for his talent and his ability to speak truth to power. On a weekly basis, Conrad addressed the social justice issues of the day—poverty in America, movements for civil rights, the Vietnam War, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and corporate and political corruption were leading topics. His criticism of president Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal landed Conrad on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List, which Conrad regarded as a badge of honor.

==Early life==
Conrad was born to Robert and Florence Conrad. He was raised in a conservative, Catholic family with his identical twin brother James and older brother Bob in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He attended St. Augustin Elementary School in Des Moines, where he first began to show interest in art by writing on the bathroom wall. He was left-handed, but was forced by teachers to favor his right hand. Until the age of 12, Conrad stuttered. At an early age, Conrad was exposed to the work of Jay Norwood Darling, more popularly known as &quot;Ding Darling&quot;, whose conservative cartoons were featured in local newspapers and who became a &quot;childhood role model&quot; for Conrad.

After graduating from Roosevelt High School, he and his brother spent time working construction jobs in Valdez, Alaska. Conrad also honed his talent as a musician while playing piano in a bordello. With World War II raging, Conrad and his brother enlisted. Because of his poor eyesight, Conrad was initially found to be unfit for military service, but he later served as a truck driver with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Pacific Theater of Operations at Guam and Okinawa, where he was given the nickname of &quot;Con&quot;. He originally planned to attend Iowa State University after the war in 1945, but instead taught himself to play bass and joined a big band.

When the band did not work out, Conrad enrolled at the University of Iowa in 1946, where he studied art. He first got the idea to become a cartoonist while hanging out at a local bar in Iowa City. At the bar, his friend Charlie Carroll, then the editor for the school&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Daily Iowan&quot;, told Conrad that they needed a cartoonist, and he invited Conrad to give it a try. One of his first cartoons for the &quot;Daily Iowan&quot; depicted Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States. Conrad was soon creating six cartoons a week. Impressed with Conrad&#x27;s cartoons, his professors sent the &quot;Denver Post&quot; copies of his work.

==&quot;Denver Post&quot;==
After graduating from the University of Iowa with a degree in art in 1950, Conrad joined the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, where he drew cartoons for the next 14 years. Early in his career, Conrad sought out the then retired Ding Darling in Florida for advice, and showed him copies of his work from the &quot;Daily Iowan&quot;. Unimpressed, Ding told Conrad to &quot;get into another line of work&quot;. This discouragement from his childhood role model pushed Conrad to work harder at the &quot;Post&quot;. At the newspaper he received support and encouragement from his editor, Palmer Hoyt, although he occasionally ran into trouble, especially when he attracted attention for creating critical, unflattering cartoons of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States. In 1960, &quot;Time&quot; magazine recognized Conrad&#x27;s talent, saying that he was &quot;probably the nation&#x27;s hottest new cartooning property&quot;. Conrad received the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1964. His cartoons for the &quot;Post&quot; were distributed through the Register and Tribune Syndicate in 81 newspapers.

Previously, in December 1963, lead cartoonist Bruce Russell of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; died of a heart attack. Russell had worked for the conservative paper since 1927. Publisher Otis Chandler, in an attempt to replace Russell and to improve the reputation of the &quot;Times&quot;, recruited Paul Conrad with the help of editor Nick Boddie Williams. Conrad took the offer of an initial three-year contract and was later replaced at the &quot;Post&quot; in August 1964 by Australian cartoonist Pat Oliphant from the &quot;Adelaide Advertiser&quot;. Conrad also lectured at the Denver Art Museum in 1964 under a sponsorship from the Cooke-Daniels Lecture Fund.

==&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;==
Conrad moved his family to southern California, and for three decades, from 1964 to 1993, he worked as the chief editorial cartoonist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. His cartoons were now syndicated to hundreds of newspapers worldwide. In April 1967, Conrad drew the cover for &quot;Time&quot; magazine in an issue about the potential candidates for the 1968 United States presidential election. The cover art depicts the upcoming election as a horse race with the candidates as jockey&#x27;s weighing-in. Caricatures of Lyndon B. Johnson, Bobby Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Romney, Nelson Rockefeller, and Charles Percy grace the cover.

During the Watergate scandal, Conrad drew numerous cartoons about Richard Nixon&#x27;s downfall. One cartoon showed Nixon, during his last days as president, nailing himself to a cross. Conrad later described the cartoon as one of his all-time favorites. In 1973, the Associated Press contacted Conrad to inform him that he had been added to Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List. Unperturbed, Conrad considered his place on this list as a badge of honor, but members of the list were exposed to greater scrutiny by the government and subject to investigation. His tax returns were subsequently audited by the IRS several times, but no changes were made.

Conrad accepted an early retirement from the &quot;Times&quot; on April 1, 1993, but continued to draw four cartoons a week in syndication for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. Editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez replaced Conrad at the &quot;Times&quot; with a conservative approach.

==Sculptures==

Conrad first became interested in sculpture in the mid-1970s. After working on a drawing of a crucifix depicting the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, he decided to use steel to create it. He spent time at the public library learning to make welded sculpture and three months later emerged with a sculpture titled &quot;The Trinity&quot;, which was installed at Marymount College. Although it was made from steel, Conrad gave &quot;The Trinity&quot; a verde patina to give it the appearance of copper. The sculpture was restored in 2012.

After working with large sculpture, Conrad began creating small bronze sculptures of famous Americans, beginning with Richard Nixon. Additional sculptures followed, including caricatures of Jerry Brown, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, John F. Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. Six of these sculptures were featured in an exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1979. In the 1980s, Conrad often donated smaller bronze sculptures for fundraisers. Later sculptures included Golda Meir, Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Writer Grady Miller of the &quot;Canyon News&quot;, who met and visited with Conrad at his home in the late 1990s, recalled that Conrad &quot;was specially proud of his bronze sculptures, which could be taken as an illustration of both his artistic range and his political beliefs&quot;.

Conrad also created several other works of public art: &quot;Risen Christ&quot;, an altar piece located at Saint John Fisher Catholic Church in Rancho Palos Verdes, California; &quot;Otis Chandler&quot;, a bust of the publisher installed in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; building; and &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, a peace monument in the shape of a mushroom cloud located in the Santa Monica Civic Center.

==Awards==
Conrad earned the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning three times, once for his work at the &quot;Denver Post&quot; in 1964, and twice more for his work at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, in 1971 and 1984. The Society of Professional Journalists/Sigma Delta Chi (SDX) honored him seven times with the Distinguished Service Awards for Editorial Cartooning, in 1962, 1968, 1970, 1980, 1981, 1987, and 1996. Conrad also won two Overseas Press Club awards (1981 and 1970) and received the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award four times, in 1985, 1990, 1992, and 1993. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists in 1998, and the Lifetime Public Service Award from the Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles in 2000.

==Controversies==
As an editorial cartoonist who openly editorialized from a liberal point of view on the issues of the day, Conrad was involved in many publicized political and religious disputes over his cartoons. In one dispute, he was sued unsuccessfully by the then-Mayor of Los Angeles, Sam Yorty, over an editorial cartoon portraying Yorty as crazy for thinking he would become Richard Nixon&#x27;s Secretary of Defense. In another, he angered conservatives when he compared them to white supremacist Buford Furrow in a cartoon. Conrad&#x27;s cartoons often made fun of the governorship of Ronald Reagan, leading his wife, Nancy Reagan, to phone publisher Otis Chandler and complain about how the cartoons were ruining her husband&#x27;s breakfast. The calls were so frequent, Chandler had no choice but to stop taking them. In another dispute, members of the Jewish community of Los Angeles took issue with Conrad&#x27;s portrayal of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

In the late 1970s, Pope Paul VI expressed his opinion against the ordination of women, saying that priests must represent the image of Christ. This led Conrad to draw a cartoon of the pope holding a baby who resembled a miniature version of the pope in his image. Cardinal Timothy Manning complained to Conrad, but Conrad defended his work, arguing that what the &quot;human soul&quot; has in common is far more important that its appearance in the form of a man or woman. Conrad also criticized the Catholic church for not letting priests marry and for treating their nuns poorly. &quot;This is the type of church Christ had in mind?&quot; he asked the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; in 2001.

==Personal life==
Conrad was an imposing man with a powerful voice who was often seen smoking a pipe while working on his cartoons. James Rainey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described Conrad as a &quot;towering, practically invulnerable figure&quot; standing at &quot;6 feet 2, [with] his large head framed by thick, black-rimmed glasses&quot;, his demeanor &quot;loud and often profane in person&quot;. The Library of Congress described him as &quot;a tall Midwesterner with long hair swept straight back from his forehead [who] displayed a trait that he said he often wished for in his subjects: the ability to laugh at oneself&quot;.

Conrad married Kay King, the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s society editor, in 1953. As his wife, Kay became one of only two people (along with his editor at the &quot;Times&quot;, Edwin O. Guthman) who could influence his work.

Although he was raised as a Republican and a Catholic, his views changed as he aged. By 1960, the media was comparing his point of view to an &quot;Adlai Stevenson Democrat&quot;. Conrad voted for only one Republican in his life, Dwight D. Eisenhower, but said he later regretted it. He remained a devout Catholic and his belief in social justice informed his work. According to Matt Schudel of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Conrad considered himself an unabashed political liberal, except for his long-held opposition to abortion. He changed his views in the 1980s, when he came to believe that it was a matter of private choice.&quot;

==Death==
Conrad died at home in Rancho Palos Verdes at the age of 86. His funeral was held at Saint John Fisher Catholic Church in Rancho Palos Verdes on September 11, 2010, with eulogies delivered by journalist Robert Scheer and editorial cartoonist Tony Auth. Conrad was survived by his wife, Kay King, two sons, two daughters, and one grandchild.

==Legacy==
Many publishers and journalists describe Conrad as one of the finest political cartoonists of the 20th century. According to the Associated Press, &quot;Southern California political junkies for decades would start their day either outraged or delighted at a Conrad drawing.&quot; He was one of only several post-war cartoonists to have won a total of three Pulitzers for his work and he was the only cartoonist named on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List. From 1977–1978, Conrad held the Richard M. Nixon Chair at Whittier College, Nixon&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;.

Conrad&#x27;s editorial cartoons later appeared in exhibitions at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. He authored several books about his work and donated many of his original editorial cartoons to the Prints and Photographs Division of the United States Library of Congress.

His influence and legacy as an editorial cartoonist are explored in the documentary film &quot;Paul Conrad: Drawing Fire&quot; (2007). In honor of this legacy, the &quot;Paul Conrad Scholarship&quot; is annually awarded to journalism and mass communication students by the University of Iowa. The Huntington Library, which hosts the Conrad Collection papers, calls his body of work &quot;a powerful record of key issues that have confronted [the United States] in the second half of the twentieth century&quot;.

<text>Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo (; ; 16 October 1936 – 14 February 1994) was a Ukrainian-born Soviet serial killer nicknamed &quot;the Butcher of Rostov&quot;, &quot;the Rostov Ripper&quot;, and &quot;the Red Ripper&quot; who sexually assaulted, murdered, and mutilated at least fifty-two women and children between 1978 and 1990 in the Russian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, and the Uzbek SSR.

Chikatilo confessed to fifty-six murders; he was tried for fifty-three murders in April 1992. He was convicted and sentenced to death for fifty-two of these murders in October 1992, although the Supreme Court of Russia ruled in 1993 that insufficient evidence existed to prove his guilt in nine of those killings. Chikatilo was executed by gunshot in February 1994.

Chikatilo was known as &quot;the Rostov Ripper&quot; and &quot;the Butcher of Rostov&quot; because he committed most of his murders in the Rostov Oblast of the Russian SFSR.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Andrei Chikatilo was born on 16 October 1936 in the village of Yabluchne in the Sumy Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR. At the time of his birth, Ukraine was recovering from a severe famine caused by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s forced collectivization of agriculture. Chikatilo&#x27;s parents were both collective farm labourers who lived in a one-room hut. They received no wages for their work, but instead received the right to cultivate a plot of land behind the family hut.

The family rarely had sufficient food; Chikatilo himself later claimed not to have eaten bread until the age of 12, adding that he and his family often had to eat grass and leaves in an effort to stave off hunger. Throughout his childhood, Chikatilo was repeatedly told by his mother Anna that prior to his birth, an older brother of his named Stepan had, at the age of four, been kidnapped and cannibalized by starving neighbours, although it has never been established whether this incident actually occurred, or if a Stepan Chikatilo even existed. Nonetheless, Chikatilo recalled his childhood as being blighted by poverty, ridicule, hunger, and war.

When the Soviet Union entered the Second World War, Chikatilo&#x27;s father Roman was conscripted into the Red Army. He would later be taken prisoner after being wounded in combat. Between 1941 and 1944, Chikatilo witnessed some of the effects of the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, which he described as &quot;horrors&quot;, adding he witnessed bombings, fires, and shootings from which he and his mother would hide in cellars and ditches. On one occasion, Chikatilo and his mother were forced to watch their own hut burn to the ground. With his father at war, Chikatilo and his mother shared a single bed. He was a chronic bed wetter, and his mother berated and beat him for each offence.

In 1943, Chikatilo&#x27;s mother gave birth to a baby girl, Tatyana. Because Chikatilo&#x27;s father had been conscripted in 1941, he could not have fathered this child. As many Ukrainian women were raped by German soldiers during the war, it has been speculated Tatyana was conceived as a result of a rape committed by a German soldier. As Chikatilo and his mother lived in a one-room hut, this rape may have been committed in Chikatilo&#x27;s presence.

In September 1944, Chikatilo began his schooling. Although shy and ardently studious as a child, he was physically weak and regularly attended school in homespun clothing. His stomach was often swollen from hunger resulting from the post-war famine which plagued much of the Soviet Union. On several occasions, this hunger caused Chikatilo to faint both at home and at school, and he was consistently targeted by bullies who regularly mocked him over his physical stature and timid nature. At home, Chikatilo and his sister were constantly berated by their mother. Tatyana later recalled that in spite of the hardships endured by her parents, their father was a kind man, whereas their mother was harsh and unforgiving toward her children.

Chikatilo developed a passion for reading and memorizing data. He often studied at home, both to increase his sense of self-worth and to compensate for his myopia, which often prevented him from reading the classroom blackboard. To his teachers, Chikatilo was an excellent student upon whom they would regularly bestow praise and commendation.

===Adolescence===
By his teens, Chikatilo was both a model student and an ardent communist. He was appointed editor of his school newspaper at age 14 and chairman of the pupils&#x27; Communist Party committee two years later. An avid reader of communist literature, he was also delegated the task of organizing street marches. Although Chikatilo claimed learning did not come easy to him due to headaches and poor memory, he was the only student from his collective farm to complete the final year of study, graduating with excellent grades in 1954.

At the onset of puberty, Chikatilo discovered that he had chronic impotence, worsening his social awkwardness and self-hatred. He was shy in the company of women; his first crush, at age 17, had been on a girl named Lilya Barysheva, with whom he had become acquainted through his school newspaper, yet he was chronically nervous in her company and never asked her for a date. The same year, Chikatilo jumped upon an 11-year-old friend of his younger sister and wrestled her to the ground, ejaculating as the girl struggled in his grasp.

Following his graduation, Chikatilo applied for a scholarship at Moscow State University. Although he passed the entrance examination with good-to-excellent scores, his grades were not deemed good enough for acceptance. Chikatilo speculated his scholarship application was rejected due to his father&#x27;s tainted war record (his father had been branded a traitor for being taken prisoner in 1943) but the truth was that other students had performed better in a highly competitive exam. He did not attempt to enrol at another university; instead, he travelled to the city of Kursk, where he worked as a labourer for three months before—in 1955—enroling in a vocational school with the aim of becoming a communications technician. The same year, Chikatilo formed his first serious relationship, with a local girl two years his junior. On three occasions, the couple attempted intercourse, but on each occasion, he was unable to sustain an erection. After eighteen months, she broke off the relationship.

===Army service===
Upon completion of his two-year vocational training, Chikatilo relocated to the Urals city of Nizhny Tagil to work upon a long-term construction project. While living in Nizhny Tagil, he also undertook correspondence courses in engineering with the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute of Communication. He worked in the Urals for two years until he was drafted into the Soviet Army in 1957. Chikatilo performed his compulsory military service between 1957 and 1960, assigned first to serve with border guards in Central Asia, then to a KGB communications unit in East Berlin. Here, his work record was unblemished, and he joined the Communist Party shortly before his military service ended in 1960.

Upon completing his service, Chikatilo returned to his native village to live with his parents, briefly working alongside them on the collective farm. He soon became acquainted with a young divorcée. Their three-month relationship ended after several unsuccessful attempts at intercourse, after which the woman innocently asked her friends for advice as to how Chikatilo might overcome his inability to maintain an erection. As a result, most of his peers discovered his impotence. In a 1993 interview regarding this incident, Chikatilo stated: &quot;Girls were going behind my back, whispering that I was impotent. I was so ashamed. I tried to hang myself. My mother and some young neighbours pulled me out of the noose. Well, I thought no one would want such a shamed man. So I had to run away from there, away from my homeland.&quot;

==Move to Rostov-on-Don==
After several months, Chikatilo found a job as a communications engineer in a town located north of Rostov-on-Don. He relocated to the Russian SFSR in 1961, renting a small apartment close to his workplace. The same year, his younger sister, Tatyana, finished her schooling and moved into his apartment (his parents relocated to the Rostov region shortly thereafter). Tatyana lived with her brother for six months before marrying a local youth and moving into her in-laws&#x27; home; she noted nothing untoward with regard to her brother&#x27;s lifestyle beyond his chronic shyness around women, and resolved to help her brother find a wife and start a family.

===Marriage===
In 1963, Chikatilo married a woman named Feodosia Odnacheva, to whom he had been introduced by his younger sister. According to Chikatilo, although he was attracted to Feodosia, his marriage was effectively an arranged one which occurred barely two weeks after they had met and in which the decisive roles were played by his sister and her husband.

Chikatilo later claimed that his marital sex life was minimal and that, after his wife understood he was unable to maintain an erection, they agreed she would conceive by him ejaculating externally and pushing his semen inside her vagina with his fingers. In 1965, Feodosia gave birth to a daughter, Lyudmila. Four years later, in 1969, a son named Yuri was born.

==Teaching career==
Chikatilo chose to enrol as a correspondence student at Rostov University in 1964, studying Russian literature and philology; he obtained his degree in these subjects in 1970. Shortly before obtaining his degree, he obtained a job managing regional sports activities. Chikatilo remained in this position for one year, before beginning his career as a teacher of Russian language and literature at Vocational School No. 32 in Novoshakhtinsk.

Chikatilo was largely ineffective as a teacher; although knowledgeable in the subjects he taught, he was seldom able to maintain discipline in his classes and was regularly subjected to mockery by his students who, he claimed, took advantage of his modest nature.

One of Chikatilo&#x27;s duties at this school was ensuring the students who boarded at the school were present in their dormitories in the evenings; on several occasions, he is known to have entered the girls&#x27; dormitory in the hope of seeing them undressed. On other occasions, he discovered adolescent pupils who boarded at the school engaged in sex. He later stated the sight of adolescents engaged in intercourse &quot;disturbed&quot; him as he was confronted with the sight of &quot;children doing what I hadn&#x27;t done even when I was thirty years old.&quot;

===Sexual assaults===
In May 1973, Chikatilo committed his first known sexual assault upon one of his pupils. In this incident, he swam towards a 15-year-old girl and groped her breasts and genitals, ejaculating as the girl struggled against his grasp. Months later, Chikatilo sexually assaulted and beat another teenage girl whom he had locked in his classroom. He was not disciplined for either of these incidents, nor for the occasions in which fellow teachers observed Chikatilo fondling himself in the presence of his students.
In response to the increasing number of complaints lodged against him by pupils, the director of the school summoned Chikatilo to a formal meeting and informed him he should either resign voluntarily or be fired. Chikatilo left his employment discreetly and found another job as a teacher at another school in Novoshakhtinsk in January 1974. He lost this job as a result of staff cutbacks in September 1978, before finding another teaching position at Technical School No. 33 in Shakhty, a coal-mining town forty-seven miles north of Rostov.

By Chikatilo&#x27;s own admission, by the mid-1970s, his desire to view naked children drove him to loiter around public toilets, where he frequently spied on young girls. He also purchased chewing gum which he gave to female children he encountered in efforts to initiate contact and gain their trust. Chikatilo is known to have sexually assaulted at least three girls whom he encountered via this method.

Chikatilo&#x27;s career as a teacher ended in March 1981 following several complaints of child molestation against pupils of both sexes. The same month, he began a job as a supply clerk for a factory based in Rostov which produced construction materials. This job required him to travel extensively across much of the Soviet Union either to physically purchase the raw materials required to fulfil production quotas, or to negotiate supply contracts.

==Initial murders==
===Murder of Yelena Zakotnova===
In September 1978, Chikatilo moved to Shakhty, where he committed his first documented murder. On the evening of 22 December, he lured a 9-year-old girl named Yelena Zakotnova to an old, dilapidated hut which he had secretly purchased that year; he attempted to rape her but failed to achieve an erection. When the girl struggled, he choked her and stabbed her three times in the abdomen, ejaculating while stabbing the child. In an interview after his 1990 arrest, Chikatilo later recalled that immediately after he stabbed Zakotnova, the girl had &quot;said something very hoarsely&quot;, whereupon he strangled her into unconsciousness before throwing her body into the nearby Grushevka River. Her body was found beneath a nearby bridge two days later.
Numerous pieces of evidence linked Chikatilo to Zakotnova&#x27;s murder: spots of blood had been found in the snow close to a fence facing the house Chikatilo had purchased; neighbours had noted that Chikatilo had been present in the house on the evening of 22 December; Zakotnova&#x27;s school backpack had been found upon the opposite bank of the river at the end of the street (indicating the girl had been thrown into the river at this location); and a witness had given police a detailed description of a man closely resembling Chikatilo, whom she had seen talking with Zakotnova at the bus stop where the girl had last been seen alive. Despite these facts, a 25-year-old labourer named Aleksandr Kravchenko, who had previously served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl, was arrested for the crime. A search of Kravchenko&#x27;s home revealed spots of blood on his wife&#x27;s jumper: the blood type was determined to match both Zakotnova and Kravchenko&#x27;s wife.

Kravchenko had a very strong alibi for the afternoon of 22 December 1978: he had been at home with his wife and a friend of hers the entire afternoon, and neighbours of the couple were able to verify this. Nonetheless, the police, having threatened Kravchenko&#x27;s wife with being an accomplice to murder and her friend with perjury, obtained new statements in which the women claimed Kravchenko had not returned home until late in the evening on the day of the murder. Confronted with these altered testimonies, Kravchenko confessed to the killing. He was tried for the murder in 1979. At his trial, Kravchenko retracted his confession and maintained his innocence, stating his confession had been obtained under extreme duress. Despite his retraction, Kravchenko was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death. This sentence was commuted to fifteen years&#x27; imprisonment (the maximum possible length of imprisonment at the time) by the Supreme Court in December 1980. Under pressure from the victim&#x27;s relatives, Kravchenko was retried, erroneously convicted, and eventually executed by firing squad for Zakotnova&#x27;s murder in July 1983.

Following Zakotnova&#x27;s murder, Chikatilo was able to achieve sexual arousal and orgasm only through stabbing and slashing women and children to death, and he later claimed that the urge to relive the experience had overwhelmed him. Nonetheless, Chikatilo did stress that, initially, he had struggled to resist these urges, often cutting short business trips to return home rather than face the temptation to search for a victim.

===Second murder and subsequent killings===
On 3 September 1981, Chikatilo encountered a 17-year-old boarding school student, Larisa Tkachenko, standing at a bus stop as he exited a public library in Rostov city centre. According to his subsequent confession, Chikatilo lured Tkachenko to a forest near the Don River with the pretext of drinking vodka and &quot;relaxing&quot;. When they reached a secluded area, he threw the girl to the ground before tearing off her clothes and attempting intercourse, as Tkachenko remonstrated against his actions. When Chikatilo failed to achieve an erection, he forced mud inside her mouth to stifle her screams before battering and strangling her to death. As he had no knife, Chikatilo mutilated the body with his teeth and a six-foot long stick; he also tore one nipple from Tkachenko&#x27;s body with his teeth before loosely covering her body with leaves, branches, and torn pages of newspaper. Tkachenko&#x27;s body was found the following day.

Nine months after the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, Chikatilo travelled by bus to the Bagayevsky District of Rostov to purchase vegetables. Having to change buses in the village of Donskoi, he decided to continue his journey on foot. Walking away from the bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, Lyubov Biryuk, who was walking home from a shopping trip. The two walked together for approximately a quarter of a mile until their path was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, whereupon Chikatilo pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off her dress, and killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death as he imitated performing intercourse. When her body was found on 27 June, the medical examiner discovered evidence of twenty-two knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region. Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with the handle and blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk&#x27;s eye sockets.

Following Biryuk&#x27;s murder, Chikatilo no longer attempted to resist his homicidal urges: between July and September 1982, he killed a further five victims between the ages of 9 and 18. He established a pattern of approaching children, runaways, and young vagrants at bus or railway stations, enticing them to a nearby forest or other secluded area, and killing them, usually by stabbing, slashing and eviscerating the victim with a knife; although some victims, in addition to receiving a multitude of knife wounds, were also strangled or battered to death.

Many of the victims&#x27; bodies bore evidence of mutilation to the eye sockets. Pathologists concluded these injuries had been caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out the eyes of his victims. Chikatilo&#x27;s adult female victims were often prostitutes or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. He would typically attempt intercourse with these victims, but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. Chikatilo&#x27;s child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; he would lure these victims to secluded areas using a variety of ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation with the victim, such as promising them assistance, company or offering to show them a shortcut, a bus stop, a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower these victims once they were alone, often tying their hands behind their backs with a length of rope before stuffing mud or loam into the victims&#x27; mouths to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them. After the killing, Chikatilo would make rudimentary—though seldom serious—efforts to conceal the body before leaving the crime scene.

On 11 December 1982, Chikatilo encountered a 10-year-old girl named Olga Stalmachenok riding a bus to her parents&#x27; home in Novoshakhtinsk and persuaded the child to leave the bus with him. She was last seen by a fellow passenger, who reported that a middle-aged man had led the girl away firmly by the hand. Chikatilo lured the girl to a cornfield on the outskirts of the city, stabbed her in excess of fifty times around the head and body, ripped open her chest and excised her lower bowel and uterus.

===Investigation===
By January 1983, four victims thus far killed had been tentatively linked to the same killer. A Moscow police team, headed by Major Mikhail Fetisov, was sent to Rostov to direct the investigation, which gradually became known among investigators as &quot;Operation Forest Path&quot;. Fetisov established a team of ten investigators based in Rostov, charged with solving all four cases. In March, Fetisov assigned a newly appointed forensic analyst, Viktor Burakov, to head the investigation. The following month, Stalmachenok&#x27;s body was found. Burakov was summoned to the crime scene, where he examined the numerous knife wounds and eviscerations conducted upon the child and the striations on her eye sockets. Burakov later stated that, as he noted the striations upon Stalmachenok&#x27;s eye sockets, any doubts about the presence of a serial killer evaporated.

Chikatilo did not kill again until June 1983, when he murdered a 15-year-old Armenian girl named Laura Sarkisyan; her body was found close to an unmarked railway platform near Shakhty. By September, he had killed a further five victims. The accumulation of bodies found and the similarities between the pattern of wounds inflicted on the victims forced the Soviet authorities to acknowledge that a serial killer was on the loose. On 6 September 1983, the public prosecutor of the Soviet Union formally linked six of the murders thus far attributed to the same killer.

Due to the sheer savagery of the murders and the precision of the eviscerations upon the victims&#x27; bodies, police theorized that the killings had been conducted by either a group harvesting organs to sell for transplant, the work of a Satanic cult, or a mentally ill individual. Much of the police effort concentrated upon the theory that the killer must be mentally ill, homosexual, or a paedophile, and the alibis of all individuals who had either spent time in psychiatric wards or had been convicted of homosexuality or paedophilia were checked and logged in a card filing system. Registered sex offenders were also investigated and, if their alibi was corroborated, eliminated from the inquiry.

Beginning in September 1983, several young men confessed to the murders, although these individuals were often intellectually disabled youths who admitted to the crimes only under prolonged and often brutal interrogation. Three known homosexuals and a convicted sex offender committed suicide as a result of the investigators&#x27; heavy-handed tactics. As a result of the investigation, more than 1,000 unrelated crimes, including ninety-five murders, 140 aggravated assaults, and 245 rapes, were solved.

However, as police obtained confessions from suspects, bodies continued to be discovered, proving that the suspects who had confessed could not be the killer they were seeking. On 30 October 1983, the eviscerated body of a 19-year-old prostitute, Vera Shevkun, was found in Shakhty. Shevkun had been killed on 27 October. Although the mutilations inflicted upon Shevkun&#x27;s body were otherwise characteristic of those found upon other victims linked to the unknown murderer, the victim&#x27;s eyes had not been enucleated or otherwise wounded. Two months later, on 27 December, a 14-year-old Gukovo schoolboy, Sergey Markov, was lured off a train and murdered at a rural station near Novocherkassk. Markov was emasculated and suffered over seventy knife wounds to his neck and upper torso before being eviscerated.

===1984===
In January and February 1984, Chikatilo killed two women in Rostov&#x27;s Park of Aviators. On 24 March, he lured a 10-year-old boy, Dmitry Ptashnikov, away from a stamp kiosk in Novoshakhtinsk. While walking with the boy, Chikatilo was seen by several witnesses who were able to give investigators a detailed description of the killer. When Ptashnikov&#x27;s body was found three days later, police also found a footprint of the killer and both semen and saliva samples on the victim&#x27;s clothing. On 25 May, Chikatilo killed a young woman named Tatyana Petrosyan and her 10-year-old daughter, Svetlana, in a wooded area outside Shakhty; Petrosyan had known Chikatilo for several years prior to her murder. By the end of July, he had killed three additional young women between the ages of 19 and 21, and a 13-year-old boy.

In the summer of 1984, Chikatilo was fired from his work as a supply clerk for the theft of two rolls of linoleum. The accusation had been filed against him the previous February, and he had been asked to resign quietly but had refused to do so, as he had denied the charges. Chikatilo found another job as a supply clerk in Rostov on 1 August.

On 2 August, Chikatilo killed a 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in the Park of Aviators. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, to the banks of the Don River on the pretence of showing her a shortcut to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered thirty-nine slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disembowelled her, intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal. Her body was found the following morning; her excised upper lip inside her mouth.

Hours after Alekseyeva&#x27;s murder, Chikatilo flew to the Uzbek capital of Tashkent on a business trip to purchase electrical switches. By the time he returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl, Akmaral Seydaliyeva. Within two weeks, the nude body of an 11-year-old boy named Aleksandr Chepel was discovered on the banks of the Don River, strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, just yards from where Alexeyeva&#x27;s body had earlier been found and on 6 September, Chikatilo killed a young librarian, 24-year-old Irina Luchinskaya, in the Park of Aviators.

==First arrest and release==
On 13 September 1984, Chikatilo was observed by two undercover detectives attempting to talk to young women at a Rostov bus station. The detectives followed him as he wandered through the city, trying to approach women and committing acts of frotteurism in public places. Upon Chikatilo&#x27;s arrival at the city&#x27;s central market he was arrested and held. A search of his belongings revealed a knife with a blade, several lengths of rope, and a jar of Vaseline. He was also discovered to be under investigation for minor theft at one of his former employers, which gave the investigators the legal right to hold him for a prolonged period of time. Chikatilo&#x27;s dubious background was uncovered, and his physical description matched the description of the man seen walking alongside Dmitry Ptashnikov prior to the boy&#x27;s murder. A sample of Chikatilo&#x27;s blood was taken, the results of which revealed his blood group to be type A, whereas semen samples found upon a total of six victims murdered by the unknown killer throughout the spring and summer of 1984 had been classified by medical examiners as being type AB. Chikatilo&#x27;s name was added to the card index file used by investigators; however, the results of his blood type analysis largely discounted him as being the unknown killer.

Chikatilo was found guilty of theft of property from his previous employer. His membership of the Communist Party was revoked and he was sentenced to one year in prison. He was released from custody on 12 December 1984 after serving three months. On 8 October 1984, the head of the Russian Public Prosecutors Office formally linked twenty-three of Chikatilo&#x27;s murders into one case and dropped all charges against the mentally disabled youths who had previously confessed to the murders.
===Further murders===
Upon his release from prison in December 1984, Chikatilo found new work within the supply department of a locomotive factory in Novocherkassk and kept a low profile. He did not kill again until 1 August 1985 when, on a business trip to Moscow, he encountered an 18-year-old woman, named Natalia Pokhlistova, standing on a railway platform near Domodedovo Airport. Pokhlistova was lured off a train into a thicket of woods close to the village of Vostryakovo where she was bound, stabbed thirty-eight times in her neck and chest, then strangled to death.

Based upon the hypothesis that the killer had travelled from the Rostov Oblast to Moscow via air, investigators checked all Aeroflot flight records of passengers who had commuted between Moscow and the Rostov region between late July and early August. On this occasion, however, Chikatilo had travelled to Moscow by train and, accordingly, no documentation existed for investigators to research. Four weeks later, on 27 August, Chikatilo killed another young woman, Irina Gulyaeva, in Shakhty. As had been the case with Pokhlistova, the wounds inflicted upon the victim linked her murder to the hunt for the serial killer.

In November 1985, a special procurator, Issa Kostoyev, was appointed to supervise the investigation, which had by this stage expanded to include fifteen procurators and twenty-nine detectives assigned to work exclusively upon the manhunt. The known murders linked to the manhunt were carefully re-investigated, and police began another round of questioning of known sex offenders and homosexuals. The following month, the &quot;militsiya&quot; resumed the patrolling of railway stations around Rostov, and plain clothed female officers were ordered to loiter around bus and train stations.

At the request of Burakov, police also took the step of consulting a psychiatrist, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the first such consultation in a serial killer investigation in the Soviet Union. All crime scene and medical examiner&#x27;s reports were made available to Bukhanovsky, upon the understanding he would produce a psychological profile of the unknown murderer for investigators.

==Psychological profile==
Bukhanovsky&#x27;s 65-page psychological profile described the killer as a reclusive man aged between 45 and 50 years who had endured a painful and isolated childhood, and who was incapable of flirting or courtship with women. This individual was well educated, likely to be married and to have fathered children, but also a sadist who suffered from impotence and could achieve sexual arousal and release only by seeing his victims suffer. The murders themselves were an analogue to the sexual intercourse this individual was incapable of performing, and his knife became a substitute for a penis which failed to function normally. Because many of the killings had occurred on weekdays near mass transport hubs and across the entire Rostov Oblast, Bukhanovsky also argued that the killer&#x27;s work required him to travel regularly, and based upon the actual days of the week when the killings had occurred, the killer was most likely tied to a production schedule.

Chikatilo followed the investigation carefully, reading newspaper reports about the manhunt for the killer which had begun to appear in the press and keeping his homicidal urges under control. For almost a year following the August 1985 murder of Gulyaeva, no further victims were found in either the Rostov or Moscow Oblasts whose bodies bore the signature mutilations of the unknown murderer. Investigators did tentatively link the murder of a 33-year-old woman named Lyubov Golovakha—found stabbed to death in the Myasnikovsky District of Rostov on 23 July 1986—to the investigation, although this was solely upon the basis that the killer&#x27;s semen type matched that of the killer they were seeking, that the victim had been stripped naked prior to her murder, and that she had been stabbed in excess of twenty times. The victim had not been dismembered or otherwise mutilated, nor had she been seen near mass transportation. Because of these discrepancies, many investigators expressed serious doubts as to whether Golovakha&#x27;s murder had been committed by the killer they were seeking.

===Investigative theories===
On 18 August 1986, a victim was found buried in a depression of earth in the grounds of a collective farm in the city of Bataysk. The wounds inflicted on this victim bore the trademark mutilations of victims linked to the manhunt killed between 1982 and 1985. The victim was an 18-year-old court secretary named Irina Pogoryelova. Her body had been slit open from the neck to the genitalia, with one breast removed and her eyes cut out. As the murderer had made serious efforts to bury the body, some investigators theorized that this explained the sudden dearth in the number of victims found.

As the victims killed in the Rostov Oblast in 1985 and 1986 had died in the months of July and August, by the autumn of 1986, some investigators gave credence to the possibility that the perpetrator had relocated to another part of the Soviet Union and was returning to the Rostov Oblast only in summer. The Rostov police compiled bulletins to be sent to all forces throughout the Soviet Union, describing the pattern of wounds their unknown killer inflicted upon his victims and requesting feedback from any police force who had discovered murder victims with wounds matching those upon the victims found in the Rostov Oblast. The response was negative.

===1987===
In 1987, Chikatilo killed three times. On each occasion, the murder took place while he was on a business trip far away from the Rostov Oblast, and none of these murders were linked to the manhunt in Rostov. Chikatilo&#x27;s first murder in 1987 was committed on 16 May, when he encountered a 12-year-old boy, Oleg Makarenkov, at a train station in the Urals town of Revda. Makarenkov was lured from the station with the promise of sharing a meal with Chikatilo at his dacha; he was murdered in woodland close to the station, although his body remained undiscovered until 1991. In July, he killed a 12-year-old boy, Ivan Bilovetsky, in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhia, and on 15 September, he killed a 16-year-old vocational school student, Yuri Tereshonok, in woodland on the outskirts of Leningrad.

==Definitive resurfacing==
In 1988, Chikatilo killed three times, murdering an unidentified woman in Krasny Sulin in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before Chikatilo bound her hands behind her back and stuffed her mouth with dirt, before severing her nose from her face and inflicting numerous knife wounds to her neck. Chikatilo then bludgeoned her to death with a slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the woman had been killed with a slab of concrete, had not been disembowelled, and her murderer had not wounded her eyes or genitals, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation. In May, Chikatilo killed a 9-year-old boy named Aleksey Voronko in the Ukrainian city of Ilovaisk. The boy&#x27;s wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt. On 14 July, Chikatilo killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov&#x27;s murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov&#x27;s autopsy revealed he had been emasculated and had suffered at least thirty knife wounds.

Chikatilo did not kill again until 28 February 1989, when he killed a 16-year-old girl, Tatyana Ryzhova, in his daughter&#x27;s vacant apartment. He dismembered her body and hid the remains in a nearby sewer. As the victim had been dismembered, police did not link her murder to the investigation. Between May and August, Chikatilo killed a further four victims, three of whom were killed in Rostov and Shakhty, although only two of these victims were linked to the manhunt.

With the resurfacing of victims definitively linked to the manhunt and the fact the majority of these victims&#x27; bodies had been discovered close to railway stations, investigators assigned numerous plainclothed officers to discreetly film and photograph passengers on trains throughout the Rostov Oblast. Several trains were also fitted with hidden cameras with the intention of filming or photographing a victim in the company of his or her murderer.

On 14 January 1990, Chikatilo encountered 11-year-old Andrei Kravchenko standing outside a Shakhty theatre. Kravchenko was lured from the theatre on the pretext of being shown imported Western films Chikatilo claimed to have at his residence; his extensively stabbed, emasculated body was found in a secluded section of woodland the following month. Seven weeks after Kravchenko&#x27;s murder, on 7 March, Chikatilo lured a 10-year-old boy, Yaroslav Makarov, from a Rostov train station to Rostov&#x27;s Botanical Gardens. His eviscerated body was found the following day.

===Political and public pressure===
On 11 March, the leaders of the investigation, headed by Fetisov, held a meeting to discuss progress made in the manhunt. Fetisov was under intense pressure from the public, the press, and the Soviet Ministry of the Interior to solve the case; both he and Viktor Burakov had devoted extensive time and effort over the previous seven years in their efforts to apprehend the perpetrator. The intensity of the manhunt in the years up to 1984 had receded to a degree between 1985 and 1987, when Chikatilo had committed only three murders investigators had conclusively linked to the killer—all killed by 1986. However, by March 1990, a further six victims had been linked to the killer. In addition, following the introduction of greater media freedom as a result of &quot;glasnost&quot;, the Soviet news media was much less repressed than it had been in the early years of the manhunt and accordingly devoted extensive publicity to the case. Fetisov had also noted laxity in some areas of the investigation and warned that people would be fired if the killer was not caught soon.

Chikatilo had killed three further victims by August 1990. On 4 April, he lured a 31-year-old woman, Lyubov Zuyeva, off a train and killed her in woodland near Donleskhoz station. Her body was not found until 24 August. On 28 July, he lured a 13-year-old boy, Viktor Petrov, away from a Rostov railway station and killed him in Rostov&#x27;s Botanical Gardens; and on 14 August, he killed an 11-year-old boy, Ivan Fomin, in the reeds near Novocherkassk beach.

==Snare==
The discovery of more victims sparked a massive police operation. Because several victims&#x27; bodies had been discovered at railway stations on one rail route through the Rostov Oblast, Burakov suggested a plan to saturate all larger stations in the region with an obvious uniformed police presence which the killer could not fail to notice. The intention was to discourage the killer from attempting to strike at any of these locations and to have undercover agents patrol smaller and less busy stations, where the murderer&#x27;s activities would be more likely to be noticed. The plan was approved, and both the uniformed and undercover officers were instructed to question any adult man in the company of a young woman or child, and note his name and passport number. Police deployed 360 men at all the stations in the Rostov Oblast, but only undercover officers were posted at the three smallest stations on the route through the oblast where the killer had struck most frequently—Kundryucha, Donleskhoz, and Lesostep—in an effort to force the killer to strike at one of those three stations. The operation was implemented on 27 October 1990.

On 30 October, police found the body of a 16-year-old boy, Vadim Gromov, at Donleskhoz station. The wounds upon Gromov&#x27;s body immediately linked his murder to the manhunt: the youth had been strangled, stabbed twenty-seven times and castrated, with the tip of his tongue severed and his left eye stabbed. Gromov had been killed on 17 October, ten days before the start of the initiative. The same day Gromov&#x27;s body was found, Chikatilo lured another 16-year-old boy, Viktor Tishchenko, off a train at Kirpichnaya station and killed him in a nearby forest. Tishchenko&#x27;s body—bearing forty separate knife wounds—was found on 3 November.

===Final murder===
On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo killed and mutilated a 22-year-old woman, Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. Returning to the railway platform, he was noticed by an undercover officer named Igor Rybakov, who observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash his hands and face. When he approached the station, Rybakov also noted that Chikatilo&#x27;s coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows; Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek and what appeared to be a severe wound on one of his fingers. To Rybakov, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered the woodland near Donleskhoz station at that time of year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. Rybakov stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When Rybakov returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station and the possible blood smear observed upon his cheek.

On 13 November, Korostik&#x27;s body was found; she was the thirty-eighth victim linked to the manhunt. Police summoned the officer in charge of surveillance at Donleskhoz station and examined the reports of all men stopped and questioned in the previous week. Not only was Chikatilo&#x27;s name among those reports, but it was familiar to several officers involved in the case because he had been questioned in 1984 and had been placed upon a 1987 suspect list compiled and distributed throughout the Soviet Union. After checking with Chikatilo&#x27;s present and previous employers, investigators were able to place him in various towns and cities at times when several victims linked to the investigation had been murdered. Questioning of former colleagues from Chikatilo&#x27;s teaching days revealed that he had been forced to resign from two teaching positions due to repeated complaints of lewd behaviour and sexual assault made by his pupils.

==Surveillance and second arrest==
Police placed Chikatilo under surveillance on 14 November. In several instances, particularly on trains or buses, he was observed approaching lone young women or children and engaging them in conversation. If the woman or child broke off the conversation, Chikatilo would wait a few minutes and then seek another conversation partner. On 20 November, after six days of surveillance, Chikatilo left his house with a large jar, which he had filled with beer at a small kiosk in a local park before he wandered around Novocherkassk, attempting to make contact with children he met on his way. Upon exiting a cafe, Chikatilo was arrested by four plainclothes police officers. He offered no resistance as he was handcuffed and placed inside an unmarked police car.

Upon his arrest, Chikatilo gave a statement claiming that the police were mistaken and complained that he had also been arrested in 1984 for the same series of murders. A strip-search of the suspect revealed a further piece of evidence: one of Chikatilo&#x27;s fingers had a deep flesh wound he had self-treated with iodine. Medical examiners concluded the wound was from a human bite. Chikatilo&#x27;s penultimate victim, Viktor Tishchenko, was a physically strong youth. At the crime scene, the police found numerous signs of a ferocious physical struggle between the victim and his murderer. Although a finger bone was later found to be broken and his fingernail had been bitten off, Chikatilo had never sought medical treatment for this injury.

A search of Chikatilo&#x27;s belongings revealed he was in possession of a folding knife and two lengths of rope. A sample of his blood was taken, and he was placed in a cell inside the KGB headquarters in Rostov with a police informer, who was instructed to engage Chikatilo in conversation and elicit any information he could from him. The next day, 21 November, formal questioning of Chikatilo began. The interrogation was performed by Issa Kostoyev. The strategy chosen by the police to elicit a confession was to lead Chikatilo to believe that he was a very sick individual in need of medical help. The intention was to give Chikatilo hope that if he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by reason of insanity. Police knew their case against Chikatilo was largely circumstantial, and under Soviet law, they had ten days in which they could legally hold a suspect before either charging or releasing him.

===Blood group analysis===
On 21 November, the results of Chikatilo&#x27;s blood test again revealed his blood type to be type A and not type AB. Due to the amount of physical and circumstantial evidence investigators had thus far compiled, which indicated Chikatilo was indeed the murderer they had been pursuing, plus the fact that investigators had deduced the blood type of the murderer they had pursued using semen samples obtained from the clothing and bodies of fourteen of the victims as opposed to actual blood samples, investigators obtained a sample of Chikatilo&#x27;s semen to test his blood type, the results of which confirmed that Chikatilo&#x27;s semen was type AB, whereas his blood and saliva were type A.

Throughout the questioning, Chikatilo repeatedly denied that he had committed the murders, although he did confess to molesting several of his pupils during his career as a teacher. He also produced several written essays for Kostoyev which, although evasive regarding the actual murders, did reveal psychological symptoms consistent with those predicted by Dr. Bukhanovsky in the 1985 profile he had written for the investigators. The interrogation tactics used by Kostoyev may also have caused Chikatilo to become defensive; the informer sharing a KGB cell with the suspect reported to police that Chikatilo had informed him that Kostoyev had repeatedly asked him direct questions regarding the mutilations inflicted upon the victims.

==Confession==
On 29 November, at the request of Burakov and Fetisov, Dr. Bukhanovsky was invited to assist in the questioning of the suspect. Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to Chikatilo. Within two hours, Chikatilo burst into tears and confessed to Bukhanovsky that he was indeed guilty of the crimes for which he had been arrested. After conversing into the evening, Bukhanovsky reported to Burakov and Fetisov that Chikatilo was ready to confess.

Armed with the handwritten notes Bukhanovsky had prepared, Kostoyev prepared a formal accusation of murder dated 29 November—the eve of the expiration of the ten-day time period during which Chikatilo could legally be held before being charged. The following morning, Kostoyev resumed the interrogation. According to the official protocol, Chikatilo confessed to thirty-six of the thirty-eight murders police had linked to him, although he denied two additional murders committed in 1986 the police had initially believed he had committed. One of these victims was Lyubov Golovakha, found stabbed to death in the village of Chaltyr on 23 July 1986 and whom many investigators had had serious doubts about linking to the manhunt; the second was Irina Pogoryelova, found murdered in Bataysk on 18 August 1986 and whose mutilations closely matched those inflicted upon other victims linked to the manhunt.

Chikatilo gave a full, detailed description of each murder on the list of charges, all of which were consistent with known facts regarding each killing. When prompted, he could draw a rough sketch of various crime scenes, indicating the position of the victim&#x27;s body and various landmarks in the vicinity of the crime scene. Additional details provided further proof of his guilt: one victim on the list of charges was a 19-year-old student named Anna Lemesheva, whom Chikatilo had killed on 19 July 1984 near Shakhty station. Chikatilo recalled that as he had fought to overpower her, she had stated that a man named &quot;Bars&quot; (&quot;Leopard&quot;) would retaliate for his attacking her. Lemesheva&#x27;s fiancé had the nickname &quot;Bars&quot; tattooed on his hand.
In describing his victims, Chikatilo falsely referred to them as &quot; elements&quot; whom he would lure to secluded areas before killing. In many instances, particularly (though not exclusively) with his male victims, Chikatilo stated he would bind the victims&#x27; hands behind their backs with a length of rope before he would proceed to kill them. He would typically inflict a multitude of knife wounds upon the victim; initially inflicting shallow knife wounds to the chest area before inflicting deeper stab and slash wounds—usually thirty to fifty in total—before proceeding to eviscerate the victim as he writhed atop his or her body until he achieved orgasm. Chikatilo had, he stated, become adept at avoiding the spurts of blood from his victims&#x27; bodies as he inflicted the knife wounds and eviscerations upon them, and would regularly sit or squat beside his victims until their hearts had stopped beating, adding that the victims&#x27; &quot;cries, the blood and the agony gave me relaxation and a certain pleasure.&quot;

When questioned as to why most of his later victims&#x27; eyes had been stabbed or slashed, but not enucleated as his earlier victims&#x27; eyes had been, Chikatilo stated that he had initially believed in an old Russian superstition that the image of a murderer is left imprinted upon the eyes of the victim. However, he stated, in &quot;later years&quot;, he had become convinced this was simply an old wives&#x27; tale and he had ceased to gouge out the eyes of his victims.

Chikatilo also informed Kostoyev he had often tasted the blood of his victims, to which he stated he &quot;felt chills&quot; and &quot;shook all over&quot;. He also confessed to tearing at victims&#x27; genitalia, lips, nipples and tongues with his teeth. In several instances, Chikatilo would cut or bite off the tongue of his victim as he performed his eviscerations, then—either at or shortly after the point of death—run around the body as he held the tongue aloft in one hand. Although he also admitted that he had chewed upon the excised uterus of his female victims and the testicles of his male victims, he stated he had later discarded these body parts. Nonetheless, Chikatilo did confess to having swallowed the nipples and tongues of some of his victims.

On 30 November, Chikatilo was formally charged with each of the thirty-six murders he had confessed to, all of which had been committed between June 1982 and November 1990. Over the following days, Chikatilo confessed to a further twenty killings which had not been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast, because the bodies had not been found or, in the case of Yelena Zakotnova, because an innocent man had been convicted and executed for the murder. As had been the case with the victims compiled upon the initial list of charges, Chikatilo was able to provide details of these additional killings only the perpetrator could have known: one of these additional victims, 14-year-old Lyubov Volobuyeva, had lived in south-western Siberia, and had been killed in a sorghum field near Krasnodar Airport on 25 July 1982. Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field and that he had approached the girl as she sat in the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, Chikatilo stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, and was awaiting a connecting flight at the airport to visit relatives.

In December 1990, Chikatilo led police to the body of Aleksey Khobotov, a boy he had confessed to killing in August 1989 and whom he had buried on the outskirts of a Shakhty cemetery, proving unequivocally that he was the killer. He later led investigators to the bodies of two other victims he had confessed to killing. Three of the fifty-six victims Chikatilo confessed to killing could not be found or identified, but he was charged with killing fifty-three women and children between 1978 and 1990. He was held in the same cell in Rostov where he had been detained on 20 November to await trial.

===Psychiatric evaluation===
On 20 August 1991, after police had completed their interrogation, including re-enactments of all the murders at each crime scene, Chikatilo was transferred to the Serbsky Institute in Moscow to undergo a 60-day psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial. Chikatilo was analysed by a senior psychiatrist, Andrei Tkachenko, who noted that Chikatilo had various physiological problems, which he attributed to prenatal brain damage. Examining Chikatilo&#x27;s history, Tkachenko observed a &quot;steady but gradual descent into perversion&quot; which had been compounded by biological and environmental factors, with his increasingly extreme acts of homicidal violence ultimately committed to relieve internal tension. Tkachenko concluded on 18 October that although he suffered from a borderline personality disorder with sadistic features, he was fit to stand trial. In December 1991, details of Chikatilo&#x27;s arrest and a brief summary of his crimes were released to the newly privatized Russian media by police.

==Trial==
Chikatilo was brought to trial in Rostov on 14 April 1992, charged with fifty-three counts of murder in addition to five charges of sexual assault against minors committed when he had been a teacher. He was tried in Courtroom Number 5 of the Rostov Provincial Court, before Judge Leonid Akubzhanov.

Chikatilo&#x27;s trial was the first major media event of post-Soviet Russia. Shortly after his psychiatric evaluation at the Serbsky Institute, investigators had conducted a press conference in which a full list of Chikatilo&#x27;s crimes was released to the press, alongside a 1984 identikit of the individual charged, but not the full name or a photograph of the accused. The media first saw Chikatilo on the first day of his trial, as he entered an iron cage specifically constructed in a corner of the courtroom to protect him from attack by the enraged and hysterical relatives of his victims. In the opening weeks of the trial, the Russian press regularly published exaggerated and often sensationalistic headlines about the murders, referring to Chikatilo being a &quot;cannibal&quot; or a &quot;maniac&quot; and to him physically resembling a shaven-skulled, demonic individual.

The first two days of the trial were devoted to Akubzhanov reading the long lists of indictments against Chikatilo. Each murder was discussed individually, and on several occasions, relatives present in the courtroom broke down in tears or fainted when details of their relatives&#x27; murders were revealed. After reading the indictment, Akubzhanov announced to the journalists present in the courtroom his intention to conduct an open trial, stating: &quot;Let this trial at least teach us something, so that this will never happen anytime or anywhere again.&quot; Akubzhanov then asked Chikatilo to stand, identify himself and provide his date and location of birth. Chikatilo complied, although this would prove to be one of the few civil exchanges between the judge and Chikatilo.

Chikatilo was initially questioned in detail about each charge upon the indictment. Responding to specific questions regarding the murders, he often gave dismissive replies to questions, particularly when questioned as to the specific nature of the wounds he had inflicted upon his victims and the ruses he had used to entice his victims to the locations where he had killed them. He would become indignant only when accused of stealing personal possessions from the victims, or to his retaining organs excised from the victims missing from the crime scenes. On one occasion, when asked as to his seeming indifference as to the lifestyle and gender of those whom he had killed, Chikatilo replied: &quot;I did not need to look for them. Every step I took, they were there.&quot;

In what became a regular (though not continuous) occurrence throughout the trial, Akubzhanov berated Chikatilo as he questioned him in detail as to the charges; ordering him to &quot;shut your mouth&quot;, before adding, &quot;You&#x27;re not crazy!&quot; as Chikatilo&#x27;s responses to questions deviated into his discussing issues such as the repression his family had endured throughout his childhood, and his claiming that the charges filed against him were false. These verbal exchanges would occur whether Chikatilo was cooperative or uncooperative throughout proceedings, and the manner in which the judge questioned Chikatilo repeatedly led his defence lawyer Marat Khabibulin to protest against the accusatory nature of the court proceedings. In the instances in which Chikatilo was uncooperative throughout questioning, he would simply shout over the judge, denounce the court as a farce, and launch into rambling, disjointed speeches. On occasion, Chikatilo would also expose himself to the court or sing socialist movement anthems throughout proceedings. These antics regularly resulted in his being returned to his cell as court proceedings continued in his absence.

On 21 April, Chikatilo&#x27;s defence lawyer requested that Bukhanovsky be allowed to testify as to the contents of the 1985 psychological profile he had written, and his subsequent consultations with Chikatilo following his arrest, adding that Bukhanovsky could exert influence over Chikatilo and, by extension, might influence the court proceedings. This request was denied. The same day, Chikatilo began to refuse to answer any questions from the judge, the prosecutor or his defence lawyer. He refused to answer any questions for three consecutive days before stating his presumption of innocence had been irredeemably violated by the judge and that he intended to give no further testimony. The following day, proceedings were adjourned for two weeks.

Chikatilo withdrew his confessions to six of the killings for which he had been charged on 13 May, and also claimed he had killed four further victims who were not included upon the indictment. The same day, Khabibulin again submitted a request that his client be subjected to a second psychiatric evaluation. This motion was dismissed by the judge as being groundless. In response, Khabibulin rose from his seat, condemning the composition of the court, and arguing that the judge was unfit to continue presiding over the case. Chikatilo himself repeated his earlier remarks as to the judge making numerous rash remarks prejudging his guilt. The prosecutor, Nikolai Gerasimenko, vocally supported the defence&#x27;s claim, stating that the judge had indeed made too many such comments and had committed numerous procedural violations in his lecturing and insulting the defendant. Gerasimenko further contended that in his conducting an open trial, Chikatilo had already been effectively prejudged as being guilty by the press, before also requesting that the judge be replaced. Judge Akubzhanov would later rule that the prosecutor be replaced instead, briefly conducting the trial in the absence of a prosecutor until a replacement prosecutor, Anatoly Zadorozhny, could be found.

On 3 July, Bukhanovsky was permitted to testify as to his analysis of Chikatilo, although solely in the capacity of a witness. For three hours, Bukhanovsky testified as to his 1985 psychological profile of Chikatilo, and of the conversations he had held with Chikatilo following his arrest, which had culminated in his confession. Four psychiatric experts from the Serbsky Institute also testified as to the results of a behavioural analysis they had conducted on Chikatilo in May, following the initial adjournment of the trial. All testified as to his courtroom behaviour being strikingly in contrast to his behaviour in his cell, and that they considered his antics to be a calculated attempt to obtain acquittal on the grounds of insanity.

===Closing arguments and conviction===
On 9 August, the defence delivered their closing arguments before the judge. Upon beginning his 90-minute closing argument, Khabibulin first stated he had no confidence his voice would be heard above the &quot;general outcry&quot; for retribution against Chikatilo, before questioning the reliability of the forensic evidence presented at the trial and describing areas of Chikatilo&#x27;s confessions as being &quot;baseless&quot;. He also questioned the judge&#x27;s objectivity and harked back to the decision of the court not to allow the defence to present testimony from independent psychiatrists; emphasizing that crimes of this nature could not have been committed by an individual of sane mind. Khabibulin then formally requested the judge find his client not guilty.

The following day, prosecutor Anatoly Zadorozhny delivered his closing argument before the judge. Harking towards the earlier testimony of psychiatrists at the trial, Zadorozhny argued that Chikatilo fully understood the criminality of his actions, was able to resist his homicidal impulses, and had made numerous conscious efforts to avoid detection. Moreover, Zadorozhny emphasized that in 19 of the charges, the material evidence of the crimes had been provided by Chikatilo himself. Zadorozhny then recited each of the charges before formally requesting the death penalty.

Following the conclusion of the prosecutor&#x27;s closing argument, Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass the final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the older brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims&#x27; relatives shielded him.

On 14 October, the court reconvened to hear formal sentencing (this sentencing would not finish until the following day). Akubzhanov began sentencing by announcing Chikatilo guilty of fifty-two of the fifty-three murders for which he had been tried. He was sentenced to death for each offence. Chikatilo was also found guilty of five counts of sexual assault committed during the years he worked as a teacher in the 1970s. In reciting his findings, the judge read the list of murders again, before criticizing both the police and the prosecutor&#x27;s department for various mistakes in the investigation which had allowed Chikatilo to remain free until 1990. Particular criticism was directed towards not local police, but the prosecutor&#x27;s department—primarily procurator Issa Kostoyev—whom Akubzhanov scathed as &quot;negligent&quot;, and who had been dismissive of Chikatilo&#x27;s inclusion upon a 1987 suspect list compiled by police. Akubzhanov also rejected the numerous claims Kostoyev had made to the media in the months prior to the trial that police had deliberately withheld documents pertaining to Chikatilo from the prosecutor&#x27;s department as being provably baseless, adding that proof existed he had been in possession of all internal bulletins.

On 15 October, Akubzhanov formally sentenced Chikatilo to death plus eighty-six years&#x27; imprisonment for the fifty-two murders and five counts of sexual assault for which he had been found guilty. Chikatilo kicked his bench across his cage when he heard the verdict and began shouting abuse. However, when given an opportunity to make a speech in response to the verdict, he again remained silent. Upon passing the final sentence, Akubzhanov made the following remark:

Chikatilo was taken from the courtroom to his cell at Novocherkassk prison to await execution. He did lodge an appeal against his conviction with the Supreme Court of Russia, but this appeal was rejected in the summer of 1993.

==Execution==
Following the rejection of his appeal to the Supreme Court, Chikatilo filed a final appeal for clemency with President Boris Yeltsin. This final appeal was rejected on 4 January 1994.

On 14 February 1994, Chikatilo was taken from his death row cell to a soundproofed room in Novocherkassk prison and executed with a single gunshot behind the right ear. He was buried in an unmarked grave within the prison cemetery.

==Victims==
Note

Akubzhanov cleared Chikatilo of the murder of 15-year-old Laura Sarkisyan at his trial due to insufficient evidence. Sarkisyan, a runaway from Soviet Armenia, was last seen by her family on 18 June. In his confessions to police, Chikatilo had stated he had killed an Armenian girl in the early summer of 1983 and that she had been killed in a stretch of woodland located near Kirpichnaya railway station.

Although he had been unable to identify Sarkisyan&#x27;s picture when presented to him, the timing of her disappearance and Chikatilo&#x27;s physical description of the victim, her clothing and where he had killed her did match scattered, partial skeletal remains and personal effects which, although determined as being those of a female in her early- to mid-teens, could not be precisely identified. Despite the fact that he had at one stage denied having committed six of the murders for which he had been brought to trial, Chikatilo never specifically disputed Sarkisyan as being a victim of his.

===Suspected victims===
* Chikatilo confessed to three additional murders which police were unable to verify. According to Chikatilo, these three murders were committed in and around the city of Shakhty between 1980 and 1982. Despite his confessions, police were unable to either match his descriptions of these victims to any missing persons reports, or locate any human remains, despite thoroughly searching the locations where Chikatilo stated he had committed these murders. Therefore, he was never charged with these three further killings he claimed to have committed.
* Chikatilo is the prime suspect in the murder of 18-year-old Irina Pogoryelova, a court secretary from Bataysk who had disappeared on 11 August 1986 and whose body was found buried in the grounds of a collective farm on 18 August. Pogoryelova&#x27;s body bore precisely the same mutilations found upon victims Chikatilo killed both before and after 1986. In his initial confession, Chikatilo had denied he had killed Pogoryelova, yet later insisted at his trial he had indeed killed her.
* At his trial, Chikatilo claimed he had committed four further murders in addition to the fifty-three for which he was brought to trial. Presumably, three of these victims were the three he had initially confessed to having committed in 1990 and which the police were unable to either locate or match to any missing persons records. The fourth individual he specifically named was Irina Pogoryelova. If his claims of having killed four additional victims are true, the total number of victims Chikatilo claimed is fifty-seven.

==Media==
===Films===
* The film &quot;Citizen X&quot; (1995) is directly based upon the murders committed by Chikatilo. Inspired by Robert Cullen&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;The Killer Department&quot;, &quot;Citizen X&quot; largely portrays the investigation of the &quot;Rostov Ripper&quot; murders through the experiences of Detective Viktor Burakov, in his efforts to ensnare the killer. This film casts Stephen Rea as Burakov, Jeffrey DeMunn as Chikatilo, Donald Sutherland as Colonel Mikhail Fetisov, and Max von Sydow as Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky. One of the film&#x27;s central themes is the Soviet government&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge the existence of a serial killer in USSR until &quot;perestroika&quot;.
* The film &quot;Evilenko&quot; (2004) is loosely based upon the murders committed by Chikatilo. This film casts Malcolm McDowell as Andrei Evilenko and Marton Csokas as Inspector Lesev.
* The film &quot;Child 44&quot; (2015) is based upon the fiction novel &quot;Child 44&quot; by Tom Rob Smith, which was itself inspired by the Chikatilo case (but with the era changed to the 1950s). Chikatilo, fictionalized as &quot;Vladimir Malevich&quot;, is portrayed by British actor Paddy Considine.

<text>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a multilateral treaty that commits nations to respect the civil and political rights of individuals, including the right to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights and rights to due process and a fair trial. It was adopted by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2200A (XXI) on 16 December 1966 and entered into force on 23 March 1976 after its thirty-fifth ratification or accession. , the Covenant has 174 parties and six more signatories without ratification, most notably the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Cuba; North Korea is the only state that has tried to withdraw.

The ICCPR is considered a seminal document in the history of international law and human rights, forming part of the International Bill of Human Rights, along with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).

Compliance with the ICCPR is monitored by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which reviews regular reports of states parties on how the rights are being implemented. States must report one year after acceding to the Covenant and then whenever the Committee requests (usually every four years). The Committee normally meets at the UN Office at Geneva, Switzerland and typically holds three sessions per year.

==History==
The ICCPR (International Covenant On Civil and Political Rights) has its roots in the same process that led to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A &quot;Declaration on the Essential Rights of Man&quot; had been proposed at the 1945 San Francisco Conference which led to the founding of the United Nations, and the Economic and Social Council was given the task of drafting it. Early on in the process, the document was split into a declaration setting forth general principles of human rights, and a convention or covenant containing binding commitments. The former evolved into the UDHR and was adopted on 10 December 1948.

Drafting continued on the convention, but there remained significant differences between UN members on the relative importance of negative Civil and Political versus positive Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. These eventually caused the convention to be split into two separate covenants, &quot;one to contain civil and political rights and the other to contain economic, social and cultural rights&quot;. The two covenants were to contain as many similar provisions as possible, and be opened for signature simultaneously. Each would also contain an article on the right of all peoples to self-determination.

The first document became the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the second the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The drafts were presented to the UN General Assembly for discussion in 1954 and adopted in 1966. As a result of diplomatic negotiations the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was adopted shortly before the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Together, the UDHR and the two Covenants are considered to be the foundational human rights texts in the contemporary international system of human rights.

==Articles of the Covenant==
The Covenant follows the structure of the UDHR and ICESCR, with a preamble and fifty-three articles, divided into six parts.

Part 1 (Article 1) recognizes the right of all peoples to self-determination, including the right to &quot;freely determine their political status&quot;, pursue their economic, social and cultural goals, and manage and dispose of their own resources. It recognises a negative right of a people not to be deprived of its means of subsistence, and imposes an obligation on those parties still responsible for non-self governing and trust territories (colonies) to encourage and respect their self-determination.

Part 2 (Articles 2 – 5) obliges parties to legislate where necessary to give effect to the rights recognised in the Covenant, and to provide an effective legal remedy for any violation of those rights. It also requires the rights be recognised &quot;without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status,&quot; and to ensure that they are enjoyed equally by women. The rights can only be limited &quot;in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation,&quot; and even then no derogation is permitted from the rights to life, freedom from torture and slavery, the freedom from retrospective law, the right to personhood, and freedom of thought, conscience, religion and freedom from medical or scientific experimentation without consent.

Part 3 (Articles 6 – 27) lists the rights themselves. These include rights to:

* physical integrity, in the form of the right to life and freedom from torture and slavery (Articles 6, 7, and 8);
* liberty and security of the person, in the form of freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention and the right to &quot;habeas corpus&quot; (Articles 9 – 11);
* procedural fairness in law, in the form of rights to due process, a fair and impartial trial, the presumption of innocence, and recognition as a person before the law (Articles 14, 15, and 16);
* individual liberty, in the form of the freedoms of movement, thought, conscience and religion, speech, association and assembly, family rights, the right to a nationality, and the right to privacy (Articles 12, 13, 17 – 24);
* prohibition by law of any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence (Article 20);
* political participation, including the right to the right to vote (Article 25);
* Non-discrimination, minority rights and equality before the law (Articles 26 and 27).

Many of these rights include specific actions which must be undertaken to realize them.

Part 4 (Articles 28 – 45) governs the establishment and operation of the Human Rights Committee and the reporting and monitoring of the Covenant. It also allows parties to recognize the competence of the committee to resolve disputes between parties on the implementation of the Covenant (Articles 41 and 42).

Part 5 (Articles 46 – 47) clarifies that the Covenant shall not be interpreted as interfering with the operation of the United Nations or &quot;the inherent right of all peoples to enjoy and utilize fully and freely their natural wealth and resources&quot;.

Part 6 (Articles 48–53) governs ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Covenant.

===Rights to physical integrity===

Article 6 of the Covenant recognises the individual&#x27;s &quot;inherent right to life&quot; and requires it to be protected by law. It is a &quot;supreme right&quot; from which no derogation can be permitted, and must be interpreted widely. It therefore requires parties to take positive measures to reduce infant mortality and increase life expectancy, as well as forbidding arbitrary killings by security forces.

While Article 6 does not prohibit the death penalty, it restricts its application to the &quot;most serious crimes&quot; and forbids it to be used on children and pregnant women or in a manner contrary to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The UN Human Rights Committee interprets the Article as &quot;strongly suggest[ing] that abolition is desirable&quot;, and regards any progress towards abolition of the death penalty as advancing this right. The Second Optional Protocol commits its signatories to the abolition of the death penalty within their borders.

Article 7 prohibits torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and non-consensual medical or scientific experimentation. As with Article 6, it cannot be derogated from under any circumstances. The article is now interpreted to impose similar obligations to those required by the United Nations Convention Against Torture, including not just prohibition of torture, but active measures to prevent its use and a prohibition on refoulement. In response to Nazi human experimentation during WW2 this article explicitly includes a prohibition on medical and scientific experimentation without consent.

Article 8 prohibits slavery and enforced servitude in all situations. The article also prohibits forced labour, with exceptions for criminal punishment, military service and civil obligations.

===Liberty and security of person===

Article 9 recognises the rights to liberty and security of the person. It prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, requires any deprivation of liberty to be according to law, and obliges parties to allow those deprived of their liberty to challenge their imprisonment through the courts. These provisions apply not just to those imprisoned as part of the criminal process, but also to those detained due to mental illness, drug addiction, or for educational or immigration purposes.

Articles 9.3 and 9.4 impose procedural safeguards around arrest, requiring anyone arrested to be promptly informed of the charges against them, and to be brought promptly before a judge. It also restricts the use of pre-trial detention, requiring that it not be &#x27;the general rule&#x27;.

Article 10 requires anyone deprived of liberty to be treated with dignity and humanity. This applies not just to prisoners, but also to those detained for immigration purposes or psychiatric care. The right complements the Article 7 prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The article also imposes specific obligations around criminal justice, requiring prisoners in pretrial detention to be separated from convicted prisoners, and children to be separated from adults. It requires prisons to be focused on reform and rehabilitation rather than punishment.

Article 11 prohibits the use of imprisonment as a punishment for breach of contract.

===Procedural fairness and rights of the accused===

Article 14 recognizes and protects a right to justice and a fair trial. Article 14.1 establishes the ground rules: everyone must be equal before the courts, and any hearing must take place in open court before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal, with any judgment or ruling made public. Closed hearings are only permitted for reasons of privacy, justice, or national security, and judgments may only be suppressed in divorce cases or to protect the interests of children. These obligations apply to both criminal and civil hearings, and to all courts and tribunals. Article 14.3 mandates that litigants must be informed promptly and in detail in a language which they understand.

The rest of the article imposes specific and detailed obligations around the process of criminal trials in order to protect the rights of the accused and the right to a fair trial. It establishes the Presumption of innocence and forbids double jeopardy. It requires that those convicted of a crime be allowed to appeal to a higher tribunal, and requires victims of a Miscarriage of justice to be compensated. It establishes rights to a speedy trial, to counsel, against self-incrimination, and for the accused to be present and call and examine witnesses.

Article 15 prohibits prosecutions under &quot;ex post facto law&quot; and the imposition of retrospective criminal penalties, and requires the imposition of the lesser penalty where criminal sentences have changed between the offence and conviction. One exception is criminal proceedings held for violations of peremptory norms () under customary international law, such as genocide, slavery, torture, and wars of aggression.

Article 16 requires states to recognize everyone as a person before the law.

===Individual liberties===

Article 12 guarantees freedom of movement, including the right of persons to choose their residence, to leave and return to a country. These rights apply to legal aliens as well as citizens of a state, and can be restricted only where necessary to protect national security, public order or health, and the rights and freedoms of others. The article also recognises a right of people to enter their own country: the right of return. The Human Rights Committee interprets this right broadly as applying not just to citizens, but also to those stripped of or denied their nationality. They also regard it as near-absolute; &quot;there are few, if any, circumstances in which deprivation of the right to enter one&#x27;s own country could be reasonable&quot;.

Article 13 forbids the arbitrary expulsion of resident aliens and requires such decisions to be able to be appealed and reviewed.

Article 17 mandates the right of privacy. This provision, specifically article 17(1), protects private adult consensual sexual activity, thereby nullifying prohibitions on homosexual behaviour, however, the wording of this covenant&#x27;s marriage right (Article 23) excludes the extrapolation of a same-sex marriage right from this provision.
Article 17 also protects people against unlawful attacks to their honor and reputation. Article 17 (2) grants the protection of the law against such attacks.

Article 18 mandates freedom of religion or belief.

Article 19 mandates freedom of expression.

Article 20 mandates sanctions against inciting war and hatred.

Article 21 mandates freedom of assembly and 22 mandates freedom of association. These provisions guarantee the right to freedom of association, the right to trade unions and also defines the International Labour Organization.

Article 23 mandates the right of marriage. The wording of this provision neither requires nor prohibits same-sex marriage.

Article 24 mandates special protection, the right to a name, and the right to a nationality for every child.

Article 27 mandates the rights of ethnic, religious and linguistic minority to enjoy their own culture, to profess their own religion, and to use their own language.

===Political rights===
Article 2 and Article 3 provides an accessory non-discrimination principle. Accessory in the way that it cannot be used independently and can only be relied upon in relation to another right protected by the ICCPR.

In contrast, Article 26 contains a revolutionary norm by providing an autonomous equality principle which is not dependent upon another right under the convention being infringed. This has the effect of widening the scope of the non-discrimination principle beyond the scope of ICCPR.

==Optional protocols==
There are two Optional Protocols to the Covenant. The First Optional Protocol establishes an individual complaints mechanism, allowing individuals to complain to the Human Rights Committee about violations of the Covenant. This has led to the creation of a complex jurisprudence on the interpretation and implementation of the Covenant. , the First Optional Protocol has 116 parties.

The Second Optional Protocol abolishes the death penalty; however, countries were permitted to make a reservation allowing for use of death penalty for the most serious crimes of a military nature, committed during wartime. , the Second Optional Protocol had 90 parties.

==Reservations==
A number of parties have made reservations and interpretative declarations to their application of the Covenant.

Argentina will apply the fair trial rights guaranteed in its constitution to the prosecution of those accused of violating the general law of nations.

Australia reserves the right to progressively implement the prison standards of Article 10, to compensate for miscarriages of justice by administrative means rather than through the courts, and interprets the prohibition on racial incitement as being subject to the freedoms of expression, association and assembly. It also declares that its implementation will be effected at each level of its federal system.

Austria reserves the right to continue to exile members of the House of Habsburg, and limits the rights of the accused and the right to a fair trial to those already existing in its legal system.

Bahamas, due to problems with implementation, reserves the right not to compensate for miscarriages of justice.

Bahrain interprets Articles 3 (no sexual discrimination), 18 (freedom of religion) and 23 (family rights) within the context of Islamic Sharia law.

Bangladesh reserves the right to try people &quot;in absentia&quot; where they are fugitives from justice and declares that resource constraints mean that it cannot necessarily segregate prisons or provide counsel for accused persons.

Barbados reserves the right not to provide free counsel for accused persons due to resource constraints.

Belgium interprets the freedoms of speech, assembly and association in a manner consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights. It does not consider itself obliged to ban war propaganda as required by Article 20, and interprets that article in light of the freedom of expression in the UDHR.

Belize reserves the right not to compensate for miscarriages of justice, due to problems with implementation, and does not plan to provide free legal counsel for the same reasons as above. It also refuses to ensure the right to free travel at any time, due to a law requiring those travelling abroad to provide tax clearance certificates.

Congo, as per the Congolese Code of Civil, Commercial, Administrative and Financial Procedure, in matters of private law, decisions or orders emanating from conciliation proceedings may be enforced through imprisonment for debt.

Denmark reserves the right to exclude the press and the public from trials as per its own laws. Reservation is further made to Article 20, paragraph 1. This reservation is in accordance with the vote cast by Denmark in the XVI General Assembly of the United Nations in 1961 when the Danish Delegation, referring to the preceding article concerning freedom of expression, voted against the prohibition against propaganda for war.

The Gambia, as per its constitution, will provide free legal assistance for accused persons charged with capital offences only.

Pakistan, has made several reservations to the articles in the convention; &quot;the provisions of Articles 3, 6, 7, 18 and 19 shall be so applied to the extent that they are not repugnant to the Provisions of the Constitution of Pakistan and the Sharia laws&quot;, &quot;the provisions of Article 12 shall be so applied as to be in conformity with the Provisions of the Constitution of Pakistan&quot;, &quot;With respect to Article 13, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan reserves its right to apply its law relating to foreigners&quot;, &quot;the provisions of Article 25 shall be so applied to the extent that they are not repugnant to the Provisions of the Constitution of Pakistan&quot; and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan &quot;does not recognize the competence of the Committee provided for in Article 40 of the Covenant&quot;.

The United States has made reservations that none of the articles should restrict the right of free speech and association; that the US government may impose capital punishment on any person other than a pregnant woman, including persons below the age of 18; that &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment&quot; refers to those treatments or punishments prohibited by one or more of the fifth, eighth, and fourteenth amendments to the US Constitution; that the third clause of Paragraph 1, Article 15 will not apply; and that, notwithstanding paragraphs 2(b) and 3 of Article 10 and paragraph 4 of Article 14, the US government may treat juveniles as adults, and accept volunteers to the military prior to the age of 18. The United States also submitted five &quot;understandings&quot;, and four &quot;declarations&quot;.

==Implementation and effects==
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has 167 states parties, 67 by signature and ratification, and the remainder by accession or succession. Another five states have signed but have yet to ratify the treaty.

According to a 2013 study, the ICCPR has significantly improved human rights practices on matters where evidence-production costs and standards of proof are low, but has had a limited impact for issue areas where legally admissible evidence is costly to produce and standards of proof are high. This means that the ICCPR has &quot;significantly improved governments&#x27; respect for the freedoms of speech, association, assembly, and religion&quot; but has had insignificant effects on respect to personal integrity rights.

===Australia===
The Covenant is not directly enforceable in Australia, but its provisions support a number of domestic laws, which confer enforceable rights on individuals. For example, Article 17 of the convention has been implemented by the Australian Privacy Act 1988. Likewise, the Covenant&#x27;s equality and anti-discrimination provisions support the federal Disability Discrimination Act 1992. Finally, the Covenant is one of the major sources of &#x27;human rights&#x27; listed in the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. This law requires most new legislation and administrative instruments (such as delegated/subordinate legislation) to be tabled in parliament with a statement outlining the proposed law&#x27;s compatibility with the listed human rights A Joint Committee on Human Rights scrutinises all new legislation and statements of compatibility. The findings of the Joint Committee are not legally binding.

Legislation also establishes the Australian Human Rights Commission which allows the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to examine enacted legislation (to suggest remedial enactments), its administration (to suggest avoidance of practices) and general compliance with the covenant which is scheduled to the AHRC legislation.

In Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, the convention can be used by a plaintiff or defendant who invokes those jurisdiction&#x27;s human rights charters. While the Convention cannot be used to overturn a Victorian or ACT law, a Court can issue a &#x27;declaration of incompatibility&#x27; that requires the relevant Attorney-General to respond in Parliament within a set time period. Courts in Victoria and the ACT are also directed by the legislation to interpret the law in a way to give effect to a human right, and new legislation and subordinate legislation must be accompanied by a statement of compatibility. Efforts to implement a similar Charter at the national level have been frustrated and Australia&#x27;s Constitution may prevent conferring the &#x27;declaration&#x27; power on federal judges.

===Ireland===
Ireland&#x27;s use of Special Criminal Courts where juries are replaced by judges and other special procedures apply has been found to not violate the treaty: &quot;In the Committee&#x27;s view, trial before courts other than the ordinary courts is not necessarily, per se, a violation of the entitlement to a fair hearing and the facts of the present case do not show that there has been such a violation.&quot;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand took measures to give effect to many of the rights contained within it by passing the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act in 1990, and formally incorporated the status of protected person into law through the passing of the Immigration Act 2009.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lankan author Shakthika Sathkumara was arrested on 1 April 2019 for inciting religious violence, following a publication of a short story about homosexuality and child abuse at a Buddhist temple in Sri Lanka. The author had been adjudged the best Sinhala language short story writer in Sri Lanka&#x27;s National Youth Literary Festivals of 2010 and 2014, and was twice the recipient of the north western provincial state literary award. A group of Buddhist monks had stormed the author&#x27;s workplace demanding punitive action against him after the story first appeared on Facebook; the ICCPR prohibits &quot;advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&quot;. Human rights organizations Civicus and the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) have asserted that the charges are spurious and a clear violation of the author&#x27;s right to freedom of expression.

===United States===

====Reservations, understandings, and declarations====
The United States Senate ratified the ICCPR in 1992, with five reservations, five understandings, and four declarations. Some have noted that with so many reservations, its implementation has little domestic effect, although it has been argued that the reason behind the Senate reservations is that Article 20(2) (regarding hate speech) of the ICCPR may be unconstitutional according to Supreme Court precedent. Included in the Senate&#x27;s ratification was the declaration that &quot;the provisions of Article 1 through 27 of the Covenant are not self-executing&quot;, and a Senate Executive Report stated that the declaration was meant to &quot;clarify that the Covenant will not create a private cause of action in U.S. Courts&quot;.

Where a treaty or covenant is not self-executing, and where Congress has not acted to implement the agreement with legislation, no private right of action within the US judicial system is created by ratification. However, a reservation that is &quot;incompatible with the object and purpose&quot; of a treaty is void as a matter of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and international law, and there is question as to whether the non-self-execution declaration is even constitutional under the Supremacy Clause (Prof. Louis Henkin argues that it is not). Prof. Jordan Paust criticizes the United States&#x27; ratification subject to the non-self-execution declaration as being an abuse of the treaty.

==Parties to the Covenant==
There are a total of 174 parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

==States not party to the Covenant==
Most states in the world are parties to the ICCPR. As of 2024, the following 24 states have not become party to it, while six states have signed the Covenant but not ratified it.

<doc id="98680" wikidata="Q4356518" url="?curid=98680" title="Regional Bell Operating Company">
<text>A Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) was a corporate entity created as result of the antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) in 1974 (&quot;United States v. AT&amp;T&quot;) and settled in the Modification of Final Judgment on January 8, 1982.

AT&amp;T agreed to divest its local exchange service operating companies, effective January 1, 1984. The group of local operating companies were split into seven independent Regional Bell Operating Companies, which became known as the Baby Bells. 

RBOCs were originally known as Regional Holding Companies (RHCs). Three companies still exist that have an RBOC as a predecessor: AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyTel and CenturyLink). Some other companies are holding onto smaller segments of the companies.

==Baby Bells==
A &quot;Baby Bell&quot; is a local telephone company in the United States that was in existence at the time of the breakup of AT&amp;T into the resulting Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). Sometimes also referred to as an &quot;ILEC&quot; (Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier) they were the former Bell System or Independent Telephone Company responsible for providing local telephone exchange services in a specified geographic area.

After the Modification of Final Judgment, the resulting Baby Bells were originally named:
* Ameritech
* Bell Atlantic 
* BellSouth 
* NYNEX 
* Pacific Telesis 
* Southwestern Bell
* US West 

Prior to 1984, AT&amp;T Corp. also held investments in two smaller and otherwise independent companies, Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET). Following the 1984 breakup, these became fully independent as well. All nine local-exchange holding companies were assigned a share of the rights to the Bell trademark.

=== Shared trademarks ===

After divestiture, AT&amp;T Corp. was prohibited from using the Bell name or logo (with the notable exception of AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Laboratories) and those trademarks which would be shared by the RBOCs and the two companies AT&amp;T partially owned. Cincinnati Bell was the last RBOC to hold the &quot;Bell&quot; name, but it rebranded as Altafiber in March of 2022.

Additionally, Bell Canada, the former Bell Telephone Company of Canada (founded in 1880) and which started separating from the Bell System in 1956, and completely by 1975, continues to use the &quot;Bell&quot; trademarks, which it owns outright in Canada.

Verizon continued to use the Bell logo on its payphones (including former GTE payphones), hard hats, trucks, and buildings, most likely intending to display continued use in order to maintain the company&#x27;s trademark rights. Following the company updating its logo in 2015 and subsequent reimaging of its trucks, the Bell logo has since been removed.

Malheur Bell, an autonomous local phone company owned by Qwest, used the Bell name and logo until its merger into Qwest in 2009.

Apart from historical documents, AT&amp;T does not presently make active use of the Bell marks. Its local exchange companies have retained the &quot;Bell&quot; names; however, they have been doing business under other names since 2002. Many of these names are still listed with the US Patent and Trademark Office as current trademarks, since these names are still considered in use.

==Mergers==

Many of these companies have since merged; by the end of 2000, there were only three of the original Baby Bells left in the United States. After the 1984 breakup, part of AT&amp;T Corp.&#x27;s Bell Labs was split off into Bellcore, which would serve as an R&amp;D and standards body for the seven Baby Bells. In 1997, Bellcore was acquired by Science Applications International Corporation where it became a wholly owned subsidiary and was renamed Telcordia.

=== AT&amp;T Inc. ===
Southwestern Bell Corporation, which changed its name to SBC Communications in 1995, acquired Pacific Telesis in 1997, SNET in 1998, and Ameritech in 1999. In February 2005, SBC announced its plans to acquire former parent company AT&amp;T Corp. for over $16 billion. SBC took on the AT&amp;T name upon merger closure on November 18, 2005. SBC began trading as AT&amp;T Inc. on December 1, 2005, but began re-branding as early as November 21 of the same year. In 2006 AT&amp;T Inc. purchased BellSouth.

=== Verizon Communications ===

In 1997, NYNEX was acquired by Bell Atlantic (taking the Bell Atlantic name), which later, in 2000, acquired GTE, the largest independent telephone company. Bell Atlantic later changed its name to Verizon that same year.

In 2005, following a protracted bidding war with rival RBOC Qwest, Verizon announced that it would acquire long-distance company MCI. The Verizon and MCI merger closed on January 6, 2006.

Bell Atlantic Mobile became the largest wireless carrier in the United States through its merger with NYNEX Mobile, its acquisition of Frontier Cellular, its subsequent merger with GTE Mobile, and its joint venture with Vodafone (consolidating its AirTouch business into Bell Atlantic Mobile). The latter two transactions effectively formed Verizon Wireless (which remained a partnership between Verizon Communications and Vodafone until 2013). The company has largely maintained its lead over the years through further acquisitions (notably, of Alltel Wireless and TracFone) and through organic growth. surpassing T-Mobile and even AT&amp;T in wireless. Over time much of its wireline area was spun off including northern New England to Consolidated Communications and other areas with landline businesses to both Frontier and FairPoint Communications.

=== Lumen Technologies, Inc. ===
Lumen Technologies, Inc. was originally Century Telephone (CenturyTel), and took the Centurylink name in 2009 when it acquired Embarq, the former local operations of Sprint Nextel, which also included the former operations of Centel. The company, as CenturyTel, had acquired some Wisconsin Bell lines from Ameritech in 1998.

Qwest, a Denver-based fiber optics long-distance company, had taken over US West in 2000. CenturyLink announced in April 2010 its intent to buy Qwest for US$10.6 billion. The transaction was completed in April 2011. In August 2011, the Qwest branding was retired and replaced by that of CenturyLink. CenturyLink rebranded to Lumen Technologies in September 2020.

== Other related companies ==

=== AltaFiber ===
The former independent Bell System franchisee Cincinnati Bell, which was not part of the 1984 divestiture because AT&amp;T held only a minority stake in the company, remains independent of the RBOCs. In December 2019, Cincinnati Bell announced that Brookfield Infrastructure Partners would acquire the company for $2.6 billion. On September 7, 2021, Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets completed its purchase of Cincinnati Bell, Inc. and later rebranded the company name to AltaFiber.

=== Consolidated Communications ===
FairPoint Communications, an independent provider based in North Carolina, acquired Northern New England Telephone Operations. NNETO is an operating company split from the original New England Telephone to serve access lines in Maine and New Hampshire. The sale of these lines by Verizon to FairPoint closed in 2008. Telephone Operating Company of Vermont, a company created following FairPoint&#x27;s acquisition, was an operating company wholly owned by Northern New England Telephone Operations. In December 2016 FairPoint was purchased by Consolidated Communications, and the combined company operates under the Consolidated Communications name.

=== Frontier Communications ===
In 2010, Frontier Communications acquired Frontier West Virginia, one of the original Bell Operating Companies formerly known as the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia, in a larger deal including some former GTE companies with Verizon Communications. In December 2013, AT&amp;T agreed to sell SNET to Frontier, with the sale closing in the second half of 2014.
On April 1, 2016, Frontier Communications (FTR) completed the data conversions from the Verizon systems for the remaining three largest former GTE properties: California, Florida and Texas.
On May 1, 2020, Frontier Communications (FTR) completed the sale of its Northwest Regional companies of Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington to Ziply Fiber in an effort to avoid Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This move did not solve Frontier Communications financial problems resulting in a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy filing on April 14, 2020. Frontier went public again on May 4, 2021, with FYBR as its trading symbol on NASDAQ, after changing its name to &quot;Frontier Communications Parent&quot;.

<doc id="98691" wikidata="Q1151247" url="?curid=98691" title="More Guns, Less Crime">
<text>More Guns, Less Crime is a book by John R. Lott Jr. that says violent crime rates go down when states pass &quot;shall issue&quot; concealed carry laws. He presents the results of his statistical analysis of crime data for every county in the United States during 29 years from 1977 to 2005. Each edition of the book was refereed by the University of Chicago Press. As of 2019, the book is no longer published by the University of Chicago Press. The book examines city, county and state level data from the entire United States and measures the impact of 13 different types of gun control laws on crime rates. The book expands on an earlier study published in 1997 by Lott and his co-author David Mustard in &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot; and by Lott and his co-author John Whitley in &quot;The Journal of Law and Economics&quot;, October 2001.

== Main topics ==

Below are summaries of the main topics discussed in &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot;.

=== Shall issue laws ===

Lott examines the effects of shall issue laws on violent crime across the United States.

His conclusion is that shall issue laws, which allow citizens to carry concealed weapons, steadily decrease violent crime. He explains that this result makes sense because criminals are deterred by the risk of attacking an armed victim. As more citizens arm themselves, the danger to criminals increases.

=== Training requirements ===
Lott examines the effects of training requirements on crime rate and accident rate. He finds that training requirements have very little effect on both crime rates and accident rates.

=== Waiting periods ===
Lott examines the effects of waiting periods. These include limiting the time before purchasing a gun, and limiting the time before obtaining a concealed carry permit.

=== Brady Law ===
Lott examines the effects of the Brady law.

=== &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; and &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; Laws ===
The third edition of the book is the first study to examine Stand Your Ground and Castle Doctrine laws.

=== Other countries ===
The focus of the book is overwhelmingly on the US, but Lott does mention briefly gun ownership and crime rates in other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland, and Jamaica, noting that murder rates rose after guns were banned. He also notes that many countries, such as Switzerland, Finland, New Zealand, and Israel, have high gun ownership rates and low crime rates, while many other countries have both low gun ownership rates and either high or low crime rates.

==Reception==
=== NRC Report ===

Partially in response to Lott&#x27;s book, a sixteen-member panel of the United States National Research Council was convened to address the issue of whether right-to-carry laws influenced crime rate. They also looked at many other gun control measures, including the soon-to-expire 1994 Assault Weapon Ban, gun buy-backs, and bans on handgun possession or carry. In 2004 they issued the report &quot;Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review&quot; which examined Lott&#x27;s statistical methods in detail, including computation of the statistical uncertainties involved, and wrote:

The committee found that answers to some of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data and research methods, however well designed. Indeed, the committee was unable to find any of the laws that it examined had any effect on crime or suicide rates. In the case of right-to-carry laws, despite a large body of research, the committee found no credible evidence that the passage of right-to-carry laws decreases or increases violent crime, and there is almost no empirical evidence that the more than 80 prevention programs focused on gun-related violence have had any effect on children&#x27;s behavior, knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs about firearms. The committee found that the data available on these questions are too weak to support unambiguous conclusions or strong policy statements.

The council determined that Lott&#x27;s data sets can be subject to manipulation given a number of factors, so that different studies produce different results. &quot;While the trend models show a reduction in the crime growth rate following the adoption of right-to-carry laws, these trend reductions occur long after law adoption, casting serious doubt on the proposition that the trend models estimated in the literature reflect effects of the law change.&quot;

The issue of right-to-carry laws was the only law that drew a dissent from the committee&#x27;s otherwise universal findings that it could not reach a conclusion. In a very unusual dissent for National Research Council reports, criminologist James Q. Wilson wrote that:

The direct evidence that such shooting sprees occur is nonexistent. The indirect evidence, as found in papers by Black and Nagin and Ayres and Donohue [cited in Chapter 6], is controversial. Indeed, the Ayres and Donohue paper shows that there was a &quot;statistically significant downward shift in the trend&quot; of the murder rate (Chapter 6, page 135). This suggests to me that for people interested in RTC laws, the best evidence we have is that they impose no costs but may confer benefits. ... In sum, I find that the evidence presented by Lott and his supporters suggests that RTC laws do in fact help drive down the murder rate, though their effect on other crimes is ambiguous.

===Support===
A conference organized by the Center for Law, Economics, and Public Policy at Yale Law School and held at American Enterprise Institute was published in a special issue of &quot;The Journal of Law and Economics&quot;. Academics of all interests in the debate were invited to participate and provide refereed empirical research. As follows are some papers from that conference supported Lott&#x27;s conclusions.

===Opposition===
Some academic studies that have rejected Lott&#x27;s conclusions include the following. Virtually all of these studies contend that there seems to be little or no effect on crime from the passage of license-to-carry laws. One by Ayres and Donohue, published in 2003, finds a temporary increase in aggravated assaults. The authors of the book Freakonomics report &quot;troubling allegation that Lott actually invented some of the survey data that supports his theory&quot; and that other scholars couldn’t replicate his results (a court later dismissed Lott&#x27;s defamation claim against the authors).
*Rutgers sociology professor Ted Goertzel stated that &quot;Lott&#x27;s massive data set was simply unsuitable for his task&quot;, and that he &quot;compar[ed] trends in Idaho and West Virginia and Mississippi with trends in Washington, D.C. and New York City&quot; without proper statistical controls. He points out that econometric methods (such as the Lott &amp; Mustard RTC study or the Levitt &amp; Donohue abortion study) are susceptible to misuse and can even become junk science.
*Ian Ayres, Yale Law School, and John Donohue III, Stanford Law School, &quot;Shooting Down the More Guns, Less Crime Hypothesis,&quot; &quot;Stanford Law Review&quot;, 2003. This study found a temporary increase in aggravated assaults.

<text>The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, known simply as the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), is a center-right think tank based in Washington, D.C., that researches government, politics, economics, and social welfare. AEI is an independent nonprofit organization supported primarily by contributions from foundations, corporations, and individuals.

Founded in 1938, the organization is aligned with conservatism but does not support political candidates. AEI advocates in favor of private enterprise, limited government, and democratic capitalism. Some of their positions have attracted controversy, including their defense policy recommendations for the Iraq War, their analysis of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, and their energy and environmental policies based on their more than two-decade-long opposition to the prevailing scientific opinion on climate change.

AEI is governed by a 28-member Board of Trustees. Approximately 185 authors are associated with AEI. Arthur C. Brooks served as president of AEI from January 2009 through July 1, 2019. He was succeeded by Robert Doar.

==History==
===Beginnings (1938–1954)===
AEI grew out of the American Enterprise Association (AEA), which was founded in 1938 by a group of New York businessmen led by Lewis H. Brown. AEI&#x27;s founders included executives from Bristol-Myers, Chemical Bank, Chrysler, Eli Lilly, General Mills, and Paine Webber.

In 1943, AEA&#x27;s main offices were moved from New York City to Washington, D.C. during a time when Congress&#x27;s portfolio had vastly increased during World War II. AEA opposed the New Deal, and aimed to propound classical liberal arguments for limited government. In 1944, AEA convened an Economic Advisory Board to set a high standard for research; this eventually evolved into the Council of Academic Advisers, which over the decades included economists and social scientists, including Ronald Coase, Martin Feldstein, Milton Friedman, Roscoe Pound, and James Q. Wilson.

AEA&#x27;s early work in Washington, D.C. involved commissioning and distributing legislative analyses to Congress, which developed AEA&#x27;s relationships with Melvin Laird and Gerald Ford. Brown eventually shifted AEA&#x27;s focus to commissioning studies of government policies. These subjects ranged from fiscal to monetary policy and including health care and energy policy, and authors such as Earl Butz, John Lintner, former New Dealer Raymond Moley, and Felix Morley. Brown died in 1951, and AEA languished as a result. In 1952, a group of young policymakers and public intellectuals including Laird, William J. Baroody Sr., Paul McCracken, and Murray Weidenbaum, met to discuss resurrecting AEA. In 1954, Baroody became executive vice president of the association.

===William J. Baroody Sr. (1954–1980)===
Baroody was executive vice president from 1954 to 1962 and president from 1962 to 1978. Baroody raised money for AEA to expand its financial base beyond the business leaders on the board. During the 1950s and 1960s, AEA&#x27;s work became more pointed and focused, including monographs by Edward Banfield, James M. Buchanan, P. T. Bauer, Alfred de Grazia, Rose Friedman, and Gottfried Haberler.

In 1962, AEA changed its name to the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (AEI) to avoid any confusion with a trade association representing business interests attempting to influence politicians. In 1964, William J. Baroody Sr., and several of his top staff at AEI, including Karl Hess, moonlighted as policy advisers and speechwriters for presidential nominee Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. &quot;Even though Baroody and his staff sought to support Goldwater on their own time without using the institution&#x27;s resources, AEI came under scrutiny of the IRS in the years following the campaign,&quot; author Andrew Rich wrote in 2004. Representative Wright Patman subpoenaed the institute&#x27;s tax papers, and the IRS initiated a two-year investigation of AEI. After this, AEI&#x27;s officers attempted to avoid the appearance of partisan political advocacy.

Baroody recruited a resident research faculty; Harvard University economist Gottfried Haberler was the first to join in 1972. In 1977, former president Gerald Ford joined AEI as a &quot;distinguished fellow.&quot; Ford brought several of his administration officials with him, including Robert Bork, Arthur Burns, David Gergen, James C. Miller III, Laurence Silberman, and Antonin Scalia. Ford also founded the AEI World Forum, which he hosted until 2005. Other staff hired during this time included Walter Berns and Herbert Stein. Baroody&#x27;s son, William J. Baroody Jr., a Ford White House official, also joined AEI, and later became president of AEI, succeeding his father in that role in 1978.

The elder Baroody made an effort to recruit neoconservatives who had supported the New Deal and Great Society but were disaffected by what they perceived as the failure of the welfare state. This also included Cold War hawks who rejected the peace agenda of 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern. Baroody brought Jeane Kirkpatrick, Irving Kristol, Michael Novak, and Ben Wattenberg to AEI.

While at AEI, Kirkpatrick authored &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot;, which brought her to the attention of Ronald Reagan, and Kirkpatrick was later named U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations. AEI also became a home for supply-side economists during the late 1970s and early 1980s. By 1980, AEI had grown from a budget of $1 million and a staff of ten to a budget of $8 million and a staff of 125.

===William J. Baroody Jr. (1980–1986)===
Baroody Sr. retired in 1978, and was replaced by his son, William J. Baroody Jr. Baroody Sr. died in 1980, shortly before Reagan took office as U.S. president in January 1981. According to &quot;Politico&quot;, the think tank &quot;rose to prominence&quot; in this period &quot;as the primary intellectual home of supply-side economics and neoconservatism.&quot;

During the Reagan administration, several AEI staff were hired by the administration. But this, combined with prodigious growth, diffusion of research activities, and managerial problems, proved costly. Some foundations then supporting AEI perceived a drift toward the center politically. Centrists like Ford, Burns, and Stein clashed with rising movement conservatives. In 1986, the John M. Olin Foundation and the Smith Richardson Foundation withdrew funding for AEI, pushing it to the brink of bankruptcy. The board of trustees fired Baroody Jr. and, after Paul McCracken then served briefly as interim president.

===Christopher DeMuth (1986–2008)===

In December 1986, AEI hired Christopher DeMuth as its new president, and DeMuth served in the role for 22 years.

In 1990, AEI hired Charles Murray (and received his Bradley Foundation support for &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;) after the Manhattan Institute dropped him. Others brought to AEI by DeMuth included John Bolton, Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, Richard Cheney, Lynne Cheney, Michael Barone, James K. Glassman, Newt Gingrich, John Lott, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali. During DeMuth&#x27;s tenure, the organization turned further to the political right.

AEI had severe financial problems when DeMuth began his presidency. During the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations, AEI&#x27;s revenues grew from $10 million to $18.9 million. Academic David M. Lampton writes that DeMuth was responsive to the financial power of &quot;America&#x27;s hard right&quot;.

The institute&#x27;s publications &quot;Public Opinion&quot; and &quot;The AEI Economist&quot; were merged into &quot;The American Enterprise&quot;, edited by Karlyn Bowman from 1990 to 1995 and by Karl Zinsmeister from 1995 to 2006, when Glassman created &quot;The American&quot;.

AEI was closely tied to the George W. Bush administration. More than 20 staff members served either in a Bush administration policy post or on one of the government&#x27;s many panels and commissions, including Dick Cheney, John R. Bolton, Lynne Cheney, and Paul Wolfowitz. Bush addressed the institute on three occasions. &quot;I admire AEI a lot—I&#x27;m sure you know that&quot;, Bush said. &quot;After all, I have been consistently borrowing some of your best people.&quot; Bush Cabinet officials also frequented AEI. In 2002, Danielle Pletka joined AEI to promote the foreign policy department. AEI and several of its staff—including Michael Ledeen and Richard Perle—became associated with the start of the Iraq War. Bush used a February 2003 AEI dinner to advocate for a democratized Iraq, which was intended to inspire the remainder of the Mideast. In 2006–07, AEI staff, including Frederick W. Kagan, provided a strategic framework for the 2007 surge in Iraq. The Bush administration also drew on AEI scholars and their work in other areas, such as Leon Kass&#x27;s appointment as the first chairman of the President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics and Norman J. Ornstein&#x27;s work heading a campaign finance reform working group that helped draft the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act that Bush signed in 2002.

===Arthur C. Brooks (2008–2019)===
When DeMuth retired as president at the end of 2008, AEI&#x27;s staff numbered 185, with 70 scholars and several dozen adjuncts, and revenues of $31.3 million. Arthur C. Brooks succeeded him as president at the start of the Late-2000s recession. In a 2009 op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Brooks positioned AEI to be much more aggressive in responding to the policies of the Barack Obama administration. Under his leadership, AEI identified itself with &quot;compassionate conservativism&quot; and the maximisation of happiness. Politico said that Brooks &quot;helped elevate [AEI] into a bastion of free-market orthodoxy and center-right policy wonkery during the Obama years&quot;, before leaving to become a &quot;happiness expert&quot; and self-help guru. In 2018, Brooks announced that he would step down effective July 1, 2019.

====Termination of David Frum&#x27;s residency====
On March 25, 2010, AEI resident fellow David Frum announced that his position at the organization had been &quot;terminated.&quot; Following this announcement, media outlets speculated that Frum had been &quot;forced out&quot; for writing a post to his FrumForum blog called &quot;Waterloo&quot;, in which he criticized the Republican Party&#x27;s unwillingness to bargain with Democrats on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In the editorial, Frum claimed that his party&#x27;s failure to reach a deal &quot;led us to abject and irreversible defeat.&quot;

After his termination, Frum clarified that his article had been &quot;welcomed and celebrated&quot; by AEI President Arthur Brooks, and that he had been asked to leave because &quot;these are hard times.&quot; Brooks had offered Frum the opportunity to write for AEI on a nonsalaried basis, but Frum declined. The following day, journalist Mike Allen published a conversation with Frum, in which Frum expressed a belief that his termination was the result of pressure from donors. According to Frum, &quot;AEI represents the best of the conservative world... But the elite isn&#x27;t leading anymore... I think Arthur [Brooks] took no pleasure in this. I think he was embarrassed.&quot;

===Robert Doar (2019–present)===
In January 2019, Robert Doar was selected by AEI&#x27;s board of trustees to be AEI&#x27;s 12th president, succeeding Arthur Brooks on July 1, 2019. In October 2023, Doar led an AEI delegation (including Kori Schake, Dan Blumenthal, Zack Cooper, and Nicholas Eberstadt, among others) to visit Taiwan to meet with President Tsai Ing-wen.

==Personnel==

AEI&#x27;s officers include Robert Doar, Danielle Pletka, Yuval Levin, Michael R. Strain, and Ryan Streeter.

AEI has a Council of Academic Advisers, which includes Alan J. Auerbach, Eliot A. Cohen, Eugene Fama, Aaron Friedberg, Robert P. George, Eric A. Hanushek, Walter Russell Mead, Mark V. Pauly, R. Glenn Hubbard, Sam Peltzman, Harvey S. Rosen, Jeremy A. Rabkin, and Richard Zeckhauser. The Council of Academic Advisers selects the annual winner of the Irving Kristol Award.

==Political stance and impact==
AEI is a member of the Atlas Network of free market think tanks and is an associate member of the State Policy Network of conservative and libertarian think tanks.

In the 2000s, AEI was the most prominent think tank associated with American neoconservatism. Irving Kristol, widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of neoconservatism, was a senior fellow at AEI and the AEI issues an &#x27;Irving Kristol Award&#x27; in his honour. Paul Ryan has described the AEI as &quot;one of the beachheads of the modern conservative movement&quot;.

AEI has close ties with pro-Brexit politicians in the British Conservative Party. For instance, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, and Liz Truss have all made regular appearances at its World Forum and other events, and Suella Braverman and Liam Fox have been hosted by it.

The institute has been described as a right-leaning counterpart to the left-leaning Brookings Institution; however, the two entities have often collaborated. From 1998 to 2008, they co-sponsored the AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, and in 2006 they launched the AEI-Brookings Election Reform Project. In 2015, a working group consisting of members from both institutions coauthored a report entitled &quot;Opportunity, Responsibility, and Security: A Consensus Plan for Reducing Poverty and Restoring the American Dream&quot;.

According to the &quot;2011 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot; (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), AEI is number 17 in the &quot;Top Thirty Worldwide Think Tanks&quot; and number 10 in the &quot;Top Fifty United States Think Tanks&quot;. As of 2019, the American Enterprise Institute also leads in YouTube subscribers among free-market groups.

==Research programs==
AEI&#x27;s research is divided into seven broad categories: economic policy studies, foreign and defense policy studies, health care policy studies, political and public opinion studies, social and cultural studies, education, and poverty studies. Until 2008, AEI&#x27;s work was divided into economics, foreign policy, and politics and social policy.

===Economic policy studies===
Economic policy was the original focus of the American Enterprise Association, and &quot;the Institute still keeps economic policy studies at its core&quot;. According to AEI&#x27;s annual report, &quot;The principal goal is to better understand free economies—how they function, how to capitalize on their strengths, how to keep private enterprise robust, and how to address problems when they arise&quot;. Michael R. Strain directs economic policy studies at AEI. Throughout the beginning of the 21st-century, AEI staff have pushed for a more conservative approach to aiding the recession that includes major tax-cuts. AEI supported President Bush&#x27;s tax cuts in 2002 and claimed that the cuts &quot;played a large role in helping to save the economy from a recession&quot;. AEI also suggested that further taxes were necessary in order to attain recovery of the economy. An AEI staff member said that the Democrats in congress who opposed the Bush stimulus plan were foolish for doing so as he saw the plan as a major success for the administration.

====Financial crisis of 2007–2008====
As the financial crisis of 2007–2008 unfolded, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that predictions by AEI staff about the involvement of housing GSEs had come true. In the late 1990s, Fannie Mae eased credit requirements on the mortgages it purchased and exposed itself to more risk. Peter J. Wallison warned that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#x27;s public-private status put taxpayers on the line for increased risk. &quot;Because of the agencies&#x27; dual public and private form, various efforts to force Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to fulfill their public mission at the cost of their profitability have failed—and will likely continue to fail&quot;, he wrote in 2001. &quot;The only viable solution would seem to be full privatization or the adoption of policies that would force the agencies to adopt this course themselves.&quot;

Wallison ramped up his criticism of the GSEs throughout the 2000s. In 2006, and 2007, he moderated conferences featuring James B. Lockhart III, the chief regulator of Fannie and Freddie In August 2008, after Fannie and Freddie had been backstopped by the US Treasury Department, Wallison outlined several ways of dealing with the GSEs, including &quot;nationalization through a receivership,&quot; outright &quot;privatization,&quot; and &quot;privatization through a receivership.&quot; The following month, Lockhart and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson took the former path by putting Fannie and Freddie into federal &quot;conservatorship.&quot; As the housing crisis unfolded, AEI sponsored a series of conferences featuring commentators including Desmond Lachman, and Nouriel Roubini. Makin had been warning about the effects of a housing downturn on the broader economy for months. Amid charges that many homebuyers did not understand their complex mortgages, Alex J. Pollock crafted a prototype of a one-page mortgage disclosure form.

The claim that AEI predicted and warned about the financial crisis of 2007–2008 is heavily disputed. In her book, &quot;Dark Money&quot; (2016), American investigative journalist Jane Mayer writes that contrary to their claims, AEI took the &quot;lead role&quot; in crafting a revisionist narrative about the financial crisis, promoting what equities analyst Barry Ritholtz called &quot;Wall Street&#x27;s &#x27;big lie&#x27;&quot;. AEI&#x27;s argument, &quot;that government programs that helped low-income home buyers get mortgages caused the collapse&quot;, did not &quot;withstand even casual scrutiny&quot;, according to Ritholz. Multiple studies, including those from Harvard University&#x27;s Joint Center for Housing Studies and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, did not support the conclusions about mortgages reached by AEI. Ritholz argues that AEI intentionally shifted the blame from the financial sector, many of whom worked or were affiliated with AEI, according to Mayer, to the government and the consumer, so as to continue promoting the questionable idea that the free market does not need regulation.

====Tax and fiscal policy====

Kevin Hassett and Alan D. Viard are AEI&#x27;s principal tax policy experts, although Alex Brill, R. Glenn Hubbard, and Aparna Mathur also work on the subject. Specific subjects include &quot;income distribution, transition costs, marginal tax rates, and international taxation of corporate income... the Pension Protection Act of 2006; dynamic scoring and the effects of taxation on investment, savings, and entrepreneurial activity; and options to fix the alternative minimum tax&quot;. Hassett has coedited several volumes on tax reform.

Viard edited a book on tax policy lessons from the Bush administration. AEI&#x27;s working paper series includes developing academic works on economic issues. One paper by Hassett and Mathur on the responsiveness of wages to corporate taxation was cited by &quot;The Economist&quot;; figures from another paper by Hassett and Brill on maximizing corporate income tax revenue was cited by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

====Center for Regulatory and Market Studies====

From 1998 to 2008, the Reg-Markets Center was the AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, directed by Robert W. Hahn. The center, which no longer exists, sponsored conferences, papers, and books on regulatory decision-making and the impact of federal regulation on consumers, businesses, and governments. It covered a range of disciplines. It also sponsored an annual Distinguished Lecture series. Past lecturers in the series have included William Baumol, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Alfred Kahn, Sam Peltzman, Richard Posner, and Cass Sunstein.

Research in AEI&#x27;s Financial Markets Program also includes banking, insurance and securities regulation, accounting reform, corporate governance, and consumer finance.

====Energy and environmental policy====
AEI&#x27;s work on climate change has been subject to controversy. Some AEI staff and fellows have been critical of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the international scientific body tasked to evaluate the risk of climate change caused by human activity. According to AEI, it &quot;emphasizes the need to design environmental policies that protect not only nature but also democratic institutions and human liberty&quot;. American historian of science Naomi Oreskes notes that this idea became prominent during the conservative turn towards anti-environmentalism in the 1980s. Corporations claimed to uphold a kind of laissez-faire capitalism that promoted individual rights by pushing for deregulation. To do this successfully, companies would fund think tanks like AEI to cast doubt on science and spread disinformation by arguing that environmental dangers were unproven.

When the Kyoto Protocol (designed to reduce carbon emissions globally) was approaching in 1997, AEI was hesitant to encourage the U.S. to join. In an essay from the AEI outlook series of 2007, the authors discuss the Kyoto Protocol and state that the United States &quot;should be wary of joining an international emissions-trading regime&quot;. To back this statement, they point out that committing to the Kyoto emissions goal would be a significant and unrealistic obligation for the United States. In addition, they state that the Kyoto regulations would have an impact not only on governmental policies, but also the private sector through expanding government control over investment decisions. AEI staff said that &quot;dilution of sovereignty&quot; would be the result if the U.S. signed the treaty.

In February 2007, a number of sources, including the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, reported that the AEI had offered scientists $10,000 plus travel expenses and additional payments, asking them to dispute the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. This offer was criticized as bribery. The letters alleged that the IPCC was &quot;resistant to reasonable criticism and dissent, and prone to summary conclusions that are poorly supported by the analytical work&quot; and asked for essays that &quot;thoughtfully explore the limitations of climate model outputs&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the AEI received $1.6 million in funding from ExxonMobil, and further notes that former ExxonMobil CEO Lee R. Raymond is the vice-chairman of AEI&#x27;s board of trustees. This story was repeated by &quot;Newsweek&quot;, which drew criticism from its contributing editor Robert J. Samuelson because &quot;this accusation was long ago discredited, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; shouldn&#x27;t have lent it respectability.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; article was disputed in a &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial. The editorial stated: &quot;AEI doesn&#x27;t lobby, didn&#x27;t offer money to scientists to question global warming, and the money it did pay for climate research didn&#x27;t come from Exxon.&quot;

AEI has promoted carbon taxation as an alternative to cap-and-trade regimes. &quot;Most economists believe a carbon tax (a tax on the quantity of CO2 emitted when using energy) would be a superior policy alternative to an emissions-trading regime,&quot; wrote Kenneth P. Green, Kevin Hassett, and Steven F. Hayward. &quot;In fact, the irony is that there is a broad consensus in favor of a carbon tax everywhere except on Capitol Hill, where the &#x27;T word&#x27; is anathema.&quot; Other AEI staff have argued for similar policies. Thernstrom and Lane are codirecting a project on whether geoengineering would be a feasible way to &quot;buy us time to make [the] transition [from fossil fuels] while protecting us from the worst potential effects of warming&quot;. Green, who departed AEI in 2013, expanded its work on energy policy. He has hosted conferences on nuclear power and ethanol With Aparna Mathur, he evaluated Americans&#x27; indirect energy use to discover unexpected areas in which energy efficiencies can be achieved.

In October 2007, resident scholar and executive director of the AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies Robert W. Hahn commented:

AEI visiting scholar N. Gregory Mankiw wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in support of a carbon tax on September 16, 2007. He remarked that &quot;there is a broad consensus. The scientists tell us that world temperatures are rising because humans are emitting carbon into the atmosphere. Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it.&quot; After Energy Secretary Steven Chu recommended painting roofs and roads white in order to reflect sunlight back into space and therefore reduce global warming, AEI&#x27;s magazine &quot;The American&quot; endorsed the idea. It also stated that &quot;ultimately we need to look more broadly at creative ways of reducing the harmful effects of climate change in the long run.&quot; &quot;The American&quot; editor-in-chief and fellow Nick Schulz endorsed a carbon tax over a cap and trade program in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; on February 13, 2009. He stated that it &quot;would create a market price for carbon emissions and lead to emissions reductions or new technologies that cut greenhouse gases.&quot;

Former scholar Steven Hayward has described efforts to reduce global warming as being &quot;based on exaggerations and conjecture rather than science&quot;. He has stated that &quot;even though the leading scientific journals are thoroughly imbued with environmental correctness and reject out of hand many articles that don&#x27;t conform to the party line, a study that confounds the conventional wisdom is published almost every week&quot;. Likewise, former AEI scholar Kenneth Green has referred to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as &quot;the positively silly idea of establishing global-weather control by actively managing the atmosphere&#x27;s greenhouse-gas emissions&quot;, and endorsed Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;State of Fear&quot; for having &quot;educated millions of readers about climate science&quot;.

Christopher DeMuth, former AEI president, accepted that the earth has warmed in recent decades, but he stated that &quot;it&#x27;s not clear why this happened&quot; and charged as well that the IPCC &quot;has tended to ignore many distinguished physicists and meteorologists whose work casts doubt on the influence of greenhouse gases on global temperature trends&quot;. Fellow James Glassman also disputes the prevailing scientific opinion on climate change, having written numerous articles criticizing the Kyoto accords and climate science more generally for Tech Central Station. He supported the views of U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), who claims that &quot;global warming is &#x27;the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,&#x27;&quot; and, like Green, cites Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;State of Fear&quot;, which &quot;casts serious doubt on global warming and extremists who espouse it&quot;. Joel Schwartz, an AEI visiting fellow, stated: &quot;The Earth has indeed warmed during the last few decades and may warm further in the future. But the pattern of climate change is not consistent with the greenhouse effect being the main cause.&quot;

In 2013, the magazine of the UK&#x27;s Institute of Economic Affairs published an article by AEI fellow Roger Bate entitled &quot;20 years denouncing eco-militants&quot;, in which he argued that &quot;evidence of climate impact is still hard to prove, and harm even more difficult to establish&quot;, and dismissed calls for a ban on the insecticide DDT as &quot;green alarmism&quot;. In 2018, British investigative website openDemocracy repeated that AEI &quot;has long been funded by ExxonMobile&quot;, an allegation repeated by &quot;Esquire&quot; the same year, describing AEI&#x27;s Danielle Pletka of spreading disinformation about climate change on the &quot;Meet the Press&quot; TV show.

===Foreign and defense policy studies===
AEI&#x27;s foreign and defense policy studies researchers focus on &quot;how political and economic freedom—as well as American interests—are best promoted around the world&quot;. AEI staff have tended to be advocates of a hard U.S. line on threats or potential threats to the United States, including the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Russia, and terrorist or militant groups like al Qaeda and Hezbollah. Likewise, AEI staff have promoted closer U.S. ties with countries whose interests or values they view as aligned with America&#x27;s, such as Israel, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, Australia, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and emerging post-Communist states such as Poland.

AEI takes a pro-Israel stance. In 2015 it awarded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu its &#x27;Irving Kristol Award&#x27;.

AEI&#x27;s foreign and defense policy studies department, directed by Danielle Pletka, is the part of the institute most commonly associated with neoconservatism. According to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, in 2002 it was seen &quot;as the intellectual command post of the neoconservative campaign for regime change in Iraq&quot;. Prominent foreign-policy neoconservatives at AEI include Richard Perle, Gary Schmitt, and Paul Wolfowitz. Joshua Muravchik and Michael Ledeen (the latter seen as an &quot;ultra neo-conservative&quot;) spent many years at AEI, although they departed at around the same time as Reuel Marc Gerecht in 2008 in what was rumored to be a &quot;purge&quot; of neoconservatives at the institute, possibly &quot;signal[ing] the end of [neoconservatism&#x27;s] domination over the think tank over the past several decades&quot;, although Muravchik later said it was the result of personality and management conflicts.

====U.S. national security strategy, defense policy, and the &quot;surge&quot;====
In late 2006, the security situation in Iraq continued to deteriorate, and the Iraq Study Group proposed a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops and further engagement of Iraq&#x27;s neighbors. Consulting with AEI&#x27;s Iraq Planning Group, Frederick W. Kagan published an AEI report entitled &quot;Choosing Victory: A Plan for Success in Iraq&quot; calling for &quot;phase one&quot; of a change in strategy to focus on &quot;clearing and holding&quot; neighborhoods and securing the population; a troop escalation of seven Army brigades and Marine regiments; and a renewed emphasis on reconstruction, economic development, and jobs.

While the report was being drafted, Kagan and Keane were briefing President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and other senior Bush administration officials behind the scenes. According to Bob Woodward, &quot;[Peter J.] Schoomaker was outraged when he saw news coverage that retired Gen. Jack Keane, the former Army vice chief of staff, had briefed the president on December 11 about a new Iraq strategy being proposed by the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank. &#x27;When does AEI start trumping the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this stuff?&#x27; Schoomaker asked at the next chiefs&#x27; meeting.&quot;

Kagan, Keane, and Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman presented the plan at a January 5, 2007, event at AEI. Bush announced the change of strategy on January 10. Kagan authored three subsequent reports monitoring the progress of the surge.

AEI&#x27;s defense policy researchers, who also include Schmitt and Thomas Donnelly, also work on issues related to the U.S. military forces&#x27; size and structure and military partnerships with allies (both bilaterally and through institutions such as NATO). Schmitt directs AEI&#x27;s Program on Advanced Strategic Studies, which &quot;analyzes the long-term issues that will impact America&#x27;s security and its ability to lead internationally&quot;.

====Area studies====

Its Asia studies program is directed by Dan Blumenthal. The program covers &quot;the rise of China as an economic and political power; Taiwan&#x27;s security and economic agenda; Japan&#x27;s military transformation; the threat of a nuclear North Korea; and the impact of regional alliances and rivalries on U.S. military and economic relationships in Asia&quot;. Blumenthal and his team wrote several articles for ForeignPolicy.com and other outlets during the Obama presidency advocating for military support and funding for Taiwan.

Papers in AEI&#x27;s Tocqueville on China Project series &quot;elicit the underlying civic culture of post-Mao China, enabling policymakers to better understand the internal forces and pressures that are shaping China&#x27;s future&quot;.

AEI&#x27;s Europe program was previously housed under the auspices of the New Atlantic Initiative, which was directed by Radek Sikorski before his return to Polish politics in 2005. Leon Aron&#x27;s work forms the core of the institute&#x27;s program on Russia. AEI staff tend to view Russia as posing &quot;strategic challenges for the West&quot;.

Mark Falcoff, now retired, was previously AEI&#x27;s resident Latinamericanist, focusing on the Southern Cone, Panama, and Cuba. He has warned that the road for Cuba after Fidel Castro&#x27;s rule or the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo would be difficult for an island scarred by a half-century of poverty and civil turmoil. Roger Noriega&#x27;s focuses at AEI are on Venezuela, Brazil, the Mérida Initiative with Mexico and Central America, and hemispheric relations.

AEI has historically devoted significant attention to the Middle East, especially through the work of former resident scholars Ledeen and Muravchik. Pletka&#x27;s research focus also includes the Middle East, and she coordinated a conference series on empowering democratic dissidents and advocates in the Arab World. In 2009, AEI launched the Critical Threats Project, led by Kagan, to &quot;highlight the complexity of the global challenges the United States faces with a primary focus on Iran and al Qaeda&#x27;s global influence&quot;. The project includes IranTracker.org, with contributions from Ali Alfoneh, Ahmad Majidyar and Michael Rubin, among others.

====International organizations and economic development====

For several years, AEI and the Federalist Society cosponsored NGOWatch, which was later subsumed into Global Governance Watch, &quot;a web-based resource that addresses issues of transparency and accountability in the United Nations, NGOs, and related international organizations&quot;. NGOWatch returned as a subsite of Global Governance Watch, led by Jon Entine. AEI scholars focusing on international organizations includes John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and John Yoo, who researches international law and sovereignty.

AEI&#x27;s research on economic development dates back to the early days of the institute. P. T. Bauer authored a monograph on development in India in 1959, and Edward Banfield published a booklet on the theory behind foreign aid in 1970. Since 2001, AEI has sponsored the Henry Wendt Lecture in International Development, named for Henry Wendt, an AEI trustee emeritus and former CEO of SmithKline Beckman. Notable lecturers have included Angus Maddison and Deepak Lal.

Nicholas Eberstadt holds the Henry Wendt Chair, focusing on demographics, population growth and human capital development; he served on the federal HELP Commission.

Paul Wolfowitz, the former president of the World Bank, researches development policy in Africa.

Roger Bate focuses his research on malaria, HIV/AIDS, counterfeit and substandard drugs, access to water, and other problems endemic in the developing world.

===Health policy studies===

AEI scholars have engaged in health policy research since the institute&#x27;s early days. A Center for Health Policy Research was established in 1974. For many years, Robert B. Helms led the health department. AEI&#x27;s long-term focuses in health care have included national insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, pharmaceutical innovation, health care competition, and cost control.

The center was replaced in the mid-1980s with the Health Policy Studies Program. The AEI Press has published dozens of books on health policy since the 1970s. Since 2003, AEI has published the &quot;Health Policy Outlook&quot; series on new developments in U.S. and international health policy. AEI also published &quot;A Better Prescription&quot; in February 2010 to outline their ideal plan to healthcare reform, calling for putting the money and control in the hands of the consumers and continuing the market-based system of healthcare, a form of healthcare that &quot;relies on financial incentives rather than central direction and control.&quot;

According to openDemocracy, &quot;In the late 1990s, while he was funded by the tobacco industry, [AEI fellow Roger] Bate argued against the science which shows that exposure to tobacco causes cancer.&quot;

Helms long argued against the tax break for employer-sponsored health insurance, arguing that it distorts insurance markets and limits consumer choices.

Scott Gottlieb, also a medical doctor, rejoined AEI after a term as commissioner with the Food and Drug Administration. He has expressed concern about relatively unreliable comparative effectiveness research being used to restrict treatment options under a public plan.

Roger Bate&#x27;s work includes international health policy, especially pharmaceutical quality, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and multilateral health organizations. In 2008, Dora Akunyili, then Nigeria&#x27;s top drug safety official, spoke at an AEI event coinciding with the launch of Bate&#x27;s book &quot;Making a Killing&quot;.

Paul Ryan, then-minority point man for health care in the House of Representatives, delivered the keynote address at a 2009 AEI conference on mandated universal coverage, insurance exchanges, the public plan option, medical practice and treatment, and revenue to cover federal health care costs.

In 2004, as Purdue Pharma, a company known as the maker of OxyContin, one of the many drugs abused in the opioid epidemic in the United States, was facing a threat to its sales due to rising lawsuits against it, resident fellow Sally Satel wrote an op ed for the &quot;New York Times&quot;. She commented, “When you scratch the surface of someone who is addicted to painkillers, you usually find a seasoned drug abuser with a previous habit involving pills, alcohol, heroin or cocaine. Contrary to media portrayals, the typical OxyContin addict does not start out as a pain patient who fell unwittingly into a drug habit.” According to AP, Satel &quot;sometimes cited Purdue-funded studies and doctors in her articles on addiction for major news outlets and occasionally shared drafts of the pieces with Purdue officials in advance, including on occasions in 2004 and 2016.&quot; In 2018, she was hired by JD Vance&#x27;s charity, Our Ohio Renewal, to a residency in Ohio. When this was criticised because of her ties to Purdue, Satel said she “never consulted with” or “took a cent from Purdue” and didn’t know Purdue had donated money to AEI.

After undergoing a kidney transplant in 2006, Satel expanded her work from drug addiction treatment and mental health to include studies of compensation systems that she argues would increase the supply of organs for transplant.

In addition to their work on pharmaceutical innovation and FDA regulation, Gottlieb and John E. Calfee have examined vaccine and antiviral drug supplies in the wake of the 2009 flu pandemic.

===Legal and constitutional studies===

The AEI Legal Center for the Public Interest, formed in 2007 from the merger of the National Legal Center for the Public Interest, houses all legal and constitutional research at AEI. Legal studies have a long pedigree at AEI; the institute was in the vanguard of the law and economics movement in the 1970s and 1980s with the publication of &quot;Regulation&quot; magazine and AEI Press books. Robert Bork published &quot;The Antitrust Paradox&quot; with AEI support. Other jurists, legal scholars, and constitutional scholars who have conducted research at AEI include Walter Berns, Richard Epstein, Bruce Fein, Robert Goldwin, Antonin Scalia, and Laurence Silberman.

The AEI Legal Center sponsors the annual Gauer Distinguished Lecture in Law and Public Policy. Past lecturers include Stephen Breyer, George H. W. Bush, Christopher Cox, Douglas Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Colin Powell, Ronald Reagan, William Rehnquist, Condoleezza Rice, Margaret Thatcher, and William H. Webster.

Ted Frank, the director of the AEI Legal Center, focuses on liability law and tort reform. Michael S. Greve focuses on constitutional law and federalism, including federal preemption. Greve is a fixture in the conservative legal movement. According to Jonathan Rauch, in 2005, Greve convened &quot;a handful of free-market activists and litigators met in a windowless 11th-floor conference room at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington&quot; in opposition to the legality of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. &quot;By the time the meeting finished, the participants had decided to join forces and file suit... . No one paid much attention. But the yawning stopped on May 18, [2009,] when the Supreme Court announced it will hear the case.&quot;

===Political and public opinion studies===

AEI&#x27;s &quot;Political Corner&quot; includes a range of political viewpoints, from the center-left Norman J. Ornstein to the conservative Michael Barone. The Political Corner sponsors the biannual Election Watch series, the &quot;longest-running election program in Washington&quot;, featuring Barone, Ornstein, Karlyn Bowman, and—formerly—Ben Wattenberg and Bill Schneider, among others. Ornstein and Fortier (an expert on absentee and early voting) collaborate on a number of election- and governance-related projects, including the Election Reform Project. AEI and Brookings are sponsoring a project on election demographics called &quot;The Future of Red, Blue, and Purple America&quot;, co-directed by Bowman and Ruy Teixeira.

AEI&#x27;s work on political processes and institutions has been a central part of the institute&#x27;s research programs since the 1970s. The AEI Press published a series of several dozen volumes in the 1970s and 1980s called &quot;At the Polls&quot;; in each volume, scholars would assess a country&#x27;s recent presidential or parliamentary election. AEI scholars have been called upon to observe and assess constitutional conventions and elections worldwide. In the early 1980s, AEI scholars were commissioned by the U.S. government to monitor plebiscites in Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands.

Another landmark in AEI&#x27;s political studies is &quot;After the People Vote&quot;. AEI&#x27;s work on election reform continued into the 1990s and 2000s; Ornstein led a working group that drafted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002.

AEI published &quot;Public Opinion&quot; magazine from 1978 to 1990 under the editorship of Seymour Martin Lipset and Ben Wattenberg, assisted by Karlyn Bowman. The institute&#x27;s work on polling continues with public opinion features in &quot;The American Enterprise&quot; and &quot;The American&quot; and Bowman&#x27;s AEI Studies in Public Opinion.

===Social and cultural studies===

AEI&#x27;s social and cultural studies program dates to the 1970s, when William J. Baroody Sr., perceiving the importance of the philosophical and cultural underpinnings of modern economics and politics, invited social and religious thinkers like Irving Kristol and Michael Novak to take up residence at AEI. Since then, AEI has sponsored research on a wide variety of issues, including education, religion, race and gender, and social welfare.

Supported by the Bradley Foundation, AEI has hosted since 1989 the Bradley Lecture Series, &quot;which aims to enrich debate in the Washington policy community through exploration of the philosophical and historical underpinnings of current controversies&quot;. Notable speakers in the series have included Kristol, Novak, Allan Bloom, Robert Bork, David Brooks, Lynne Cheney, Ron Chernow, Tyler Cowen, Niall Ferguson, Francis Fukuyama, Eugene Genovese, Robert P. George, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Samuel P. Huntington (giving the first public presentation of his &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; theory in 1992), Paul Johnson, Leon Kass, Charles Krauthammer, Bernard Lewis, Seymour Martin Lipset, Harvey C. Mansfield, Michael Medved, Allan H. Meltzer, Edmund Morris, Charles Murray, Steven Pinker, Norman Podhoretz, Richard Posner, Jonathan Rauch, Andrew Sullivan, Cass Sunstein, Sam Tanenhaus, James Q. Wilson, John Yoo, and Fareed Zakaria.

====Education====
Education policy studies at AEI are directed by Frederick M. Hess. Hess co-directs AEI&#x27;s Future of American Education Project, whose working group includes Washington, D.C. schools chancellor Michelle Rhee and Michael Feinberg, the cofounder of KIPP. Hess works closely with Rhee: she has spoken at AEI on several occasions and appointed Hess to be one of two independent reform evaluators for the District of Columbia Public Schools. Hess coauthored &quot;Diplomas and Dropouts&quot;, a report on university graduation rates that was widely publicized in 2009. The report, along with other education-related projects, was supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

AEI is sometimes identified as a supporter of school vouchers, but Hess was critical of vouchers in 2009: &quot;[I]t is by now clear that aggressive reforms to bring market principles to American education have failed to live up to their billing. ... In the school choice debate, many reformers have gotten so invested in the language of &#x27;choice&#x27; that they seem to forget choice is only half of the market equation. Markets are about both supply and demand—and, while &#x27;choice&#x27; is concerned with emboldening consumer demand, the real action when it comes to prosperity, productivity, and progress is typically on the supply side.&quot;

AEI is a national allied organization of the American Federation for Children founded in 2010 by Dick and Betsy DeVos of the DeVos Family Foundation. The AEI were supportive of Betsy DeVos&#x27; positions when she served under Donald Trump as Education Secretary in 2017-21. Hess supported her plan to gut the Borrower Defense Rule, that enables defrauded students to seek debt relief. In a &quot;National Review&quot; op-ed, Hess praised DeVos’ proposal to base debt forgiveness on student income as “clearly better for colleges, taxpayers, and students”.

In a 2024 report co-authored with the Heritage Foundation, AEI argued that higher education institutions should not give faculty stipends to join or attend conferences of professional organizations because these groups make statements on political issues.

==Funding==
In the 1980s about 60% of its funding came from organizations like Lilly Endowment, the Smith Richardson Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Trust and the Earhart Foundation. The remaining of their funding was from major corporations like Bethlehem Steel, Exxon, J.C. Penney and the Chase Manhattan Bank.

 AEI had received $960,000 from ExxonMobil. Purdue Pharma, a company known as the maker of OxyContin, one of the many drugs abused in the opioid epidemic in the United States, donated $50,000 a year to the AEI from 2003 through 2019, plus contributions for special events, adding to a total greater than $800,000.

In the 2009 tax year, its four largest funders were a donor-advised fund, Donors Capital Fund ($2,000,000), Paul Singer ($1,100,000), the Kern Family Foundation ($1,071,912) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO), Taiwan’s equivalent to an embassy. Seventh largest was the US Chamber of Commerce ($473,000). In 2010, AEI received a 2.5 million grant from the Donors Capital Fund. Foundations associated with the Koch brothers have been major funders of the Institute.

A 2013 study by Drexel University Sociologist Robert J. Brulle noted that AEI received $86.7 million between 2003 and 2010.

AEI received more than $1.6 million from the Charles Koch Foundation between 2011 and 2016, over $5 million from conservative donor advised funds DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund between 2012 and 2016, over $1.7 million from the Sarah Scaife Foundation between 2012 and 2016, $480,000 from the Bradley Foundation from 2012 to 2016, and $425,000 from the Coors Foundation between 2011 and 2016.

In 2014, the charity evaluating service American Institute of Philanthropy gave AEI an &quot;A−&quot; grade in its CharityWatch &quot;Top-Rated Charities&quot; listing. AEI&#x27;s revenues for the fiscal year ending June 2015 were $84,616,388 against expenses of $38,611,315.

In 2017-2018, the AEI received significant funding from the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation, including $1 million in 2017.

<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Pluto (, &quot;&quot;) was the ruler of the Greek underworld. The earlier name for the god was Hades, which became more common as the name of the underworld itself. Pluto represents a more positive concept of the god who presides over the afterlife. &quot;Ploutōn&quot; was frequently conflated with Ploûtos, the Greek god of wealth, because mineral wealth was found underground, and because as a chthonic god Pluto ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest. The name &quot;Ploutōn&quot; came into widespread usage with the Eleusinian Mysteries, in which Pluto was venerated as both a stern ruler and a loving husband to Persephone. The couple received souls in the afterlife and are invoked together in religious inscriptions, being referred to as &quot;Plouton&quot; and as &quot;Kore&quot; respectively. Hades, by contrast, had few temples and religious practices associated with him, and he is portrayed as the dark and violent abductor of Persephone.

Pluto and Hades differ in character, but they are not distinct figures and share two dominant myths. In Greek cosmogony, the god received the rule of the underworld in a three-way division of sovereignty over the world, with his brother Zeus ruling the sky and his other brother Poseidon sovereign over the sea. His central narrative in myth is of him abducting Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm. &quot;Plouton&quot; as the name of the ruler of the underworld first appears in Greek literature of the Classical period, in the works of the Athenian playwrights and of the philosopher Plato, who is the major Greek source on its significance. Under the name Pluto, the god appears in other myths in a secondary role, mostly as the possessor of a quest-object, and especially in the descent of Orpheus or other heroes to the underworld.

&quot;Plūtō&quot; (; genitive &quot;Plūtōnis&quot;) is the Latinized form of the Greek &quot;Plouton&quot;. Pluto&#x27;s Roman equivalent is Dis Pater, whose name is most often taken to mean &quot;Rich Father&quot; and is perhaps a direct translation of &quot;Plouton.&quot; Pluto was also identified with the obscure Roman Orcus, like Hades the name of both a god of the underworld and the underworld as a place. &quot;Pluto&quot; (&quot;Pluton&quot; in French and German, &quot;Plutone&quot; in Italian) becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld in subsequent Western literature and other art forms.

== Hesiod ==

The name &quot;Plouton&quot; does not appear in Greek literature of the Archaic period. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, the six children of Cronus and Rhea are Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Demeter, and Hestia. The male children divide the world into three realms. Hades takes Persephone by force from her mother Demeter, with the consent of Zeus. &quot;Ploutos&quot;, &quot;Wealth,&quot; appears in the &quot;Theogony&quot; as the child of Demeter and Iasion: &quot;fine Plutus, who goes upon the whole earth and the broad back of the sea, and whoever meets him and comes into his hands, that man he makes rich, and he bestows much wealth upon him.&quot; The union of Demeter and Iasion, described also in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, took place in a fallow field that had been ploughed three times, in what seems to be a reference to a ritual copulation or sympathetic magic to ensure the earth&#x27;s fertility. &quot;The resemblance of the name &quot;Ploutos&quot; to &quot;Plouton&quot; ...,&quot; it has been noted, &quot;cannot be accidental. Plouton is lord of the dead, but as Persephone&#x27;s husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility.&quot; Demeter&#x27;s son Plutus merges in the narrative tradition with her son-in-law Pluto, redefining the implacable chariot-driver Hades whose horses trample the flowering earth.

That the underworld god was associated early on with success in agricultural activity is already evident in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, line 465–469: &quot;Pray to Zeus of the Earth and to pure Demeter to make Demeter&#x27;s holy grain sound and heavy, when first you begin ploughing, when you hold in your hand the end of the plough-tail and bring down your stick on the backs of the oxen as they draw on the pole-bar by the yoke-straps.&quot;

== Plouton and Ploutos ==

&quot;Plouton&quot; was one of several euphemistic names for Hades, described in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as the god most hateful to mortals. Plato says that people prefer the name &quot;Plouton&quot;, &quot;giver of wealth,&quot; because the name of Hades is fear-provoking. The name was understood as referring to &quot;the boundless riches of the earth, both the crops on its surface—he was originally a god of the land—and the mines hidden within it.&quot; What is sometimes taken as &quot;confusion&quot; of the two gods &quot;Plouton&quot; and &quot;Ploutos&quot; (&quot;Wealth&quot;) held or acquired a theological significance in antiquity. As a lord of abundance or riches, Pluto expresses the aspect of the underworld god that was positive, symbolized in art by the &quot;horn of plenty&quot; (cornucopia), by means of which &quot;Plouton&quot; is distinguished from the gloomier Hades.

The Roman poet Ennius (&quot;ca.&quot; 239–169 BC), the leading figure in the Hellenization of Latin literature, considered Pluto a Greek god to be explained in terms of the Roman equivalents Dis Pater and Orcus. It is unclear whether Pluto had a literary presence in Rome before Ennius. Some scholars think that rituals and beliefs pertaining to Pluto entered Roman culture with the establishment of the Saecular Games in 249 BC, and that &quot;Dis pater&quot; was only a translation of &quot;Plouton&quot;. In the mid-1st century BC, Cicero identifies Pluto with Dis, explaining that &quot;The earth in all its power and plenty is sacred to Father Dis, a name which is the same as &quot;Dives&quot;, &#x27;The Wealthy One,&#x27; as is the Greek &quot;Plouton&quot;. This is because everything is born of the earth and returns to it again.&quot;

During the Roman Imperial era, the Greek geographer Strabo (1st century AD) makes a distinction between Pluto and Hades. In writing of the mineral wealth of ancient Iberia (Roman Spain), he says that among the Turdetani, it is &quot;Pluto, and not Hades, who inhabits the region down below.&quot; In the discourse &quot;On Mourning&quot; by the Greek author Lucian (2nd century AD), Pluto&#x27;s &quot;wealth&quot; is the dead he rules over in the abyss &quot;(chasma)&quot;; the name &quot;Hades&quot; is reserved for the underworld itself.

=== Other identifications ===
In Greek religious practice, Pluto is sometimes seen as the &quot;chthonic Zeus&quot; (&quot;Zeus Chthonios&quot; or &quot;Zeus Catachthonios&quot;), or at least as having functions or significance equivalent to those of Zeus but pertaining to the earth or underworld. In ancient Roman and Hellenistic religion, Pluto was identified with a number of other deities, including Summanus, the Roman god of nocturnal thunder; Februus, the Roman god from whose purification rites the month of February takes its name and an Etruscans god of the underworld the syncretic god Serapis, regarded as Pluto&#x27;s Egyptian equivalent; and the Semitic god Muth (Μούθ). Muth was described by Philo of Byblos as the equivalent of both Thanatos (Death personified) and Pluto. The ancient Greeks did not regard Pluto as &quot;death&quot; per se.

== Mythology ==
The best-known myth involving Pluto or Hades is the abduction of Persephone, also known as Kore (&quot;the Maiden&quot;). The earliest literary versions of the myth are a brief mention in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; and the extended narrative of the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter;&quot; in both these works, the ruler of the underworld is named as Hades (&quot;the Hidden One&quot;). Hades is an unsympathetic figure, and Persephone&#x27;s unwillingness is emphasized. Increased usage of the name &quot;Plouton&quot; in religious inscriptions and literary texts reflects the influence of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which treated Pluto and Persephone as a divine couple who received initiates in the afterlife; as such, Pluto was disassociated from the &quot;violent abductor&quot; of Kore. Two early works that give the abductor god&#x27;s name as Pluto are the Greek mythography traditionally known as the &quot;Library&quot; of &quot;Apollodorus&quot; (1st century BC) and the Latin &quot;Fabulae&quot; (&quot;ca.&quot; 64 BC–AD 17).

The most influential version of the abduction myth is that of Ovid (d. 17 or 18 AD), who tells the story in both the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (Book 5) and the &quot;Fasti&quot; (Book 4). Another major retelling, also in Latin, is the long unfinished poem &quot;De raptu Proserpinae&quot; (&quot;On the Abduction of Proserpina&quot;) by Claudian (d. 404 AD). Ovid uses the name &quot;Dis&quot;, not &quot;Pluto&quot; in these two passages, and Claudian uses &quot;Pluto&quot; only once; translators and editors, however, sometimes supply the more familiar &quot;Pluto&quot; when other epithets appear in the source text. The abduction myth was a popular subject for Greek and Roman art, and recurs throughout Western art and literature, where the name &quot;Pluto&quot; becomes common (see Pluto in Western art and literature below). Narrative details from Ovid and Claudian influence these later versions in which the abductor is named as Pluto, especially the role of Venus and Cupid in manipulating Pluto with love and desire. Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and certainly by the time of Natale Conti&#x27;s influential &quot;Mythologiae&quot; (1567), the traditions pertaining to the various rulers of the classical underworld coalesced into a single mythology that made few if any distinctions among Hades, Pluto, Dis, and Orcus.
=== Offspring ===
Unlike his freely procreating brothers Zeus and Poseidon, Pluto is , and is rarely said to have children. In Orphic texts, the chthonic nymph Melinoe is the daughter of Persephone by Zeus disguised as Pluto, and the Eumenides (&quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;) are the offspring of Persephone and &quot;Zeus Chthonios&quot;, often identified as Pluto. The Augustan poet Vergil says that Pluto is the father of the Furies, but the mother is the goddess Nox (Nyx), not his wife Persephone.The lack of a clear distinction between Pluto and &quot;chthonic Zeus&quot; confuses the question of whether in some traditions, now obscure, Persephone bore children to her husband. In the late 4th century AD, Claudian&#x27;s epic on the abduction motivates Pluto with a desire for children. The poem is unfinished, however, and anything Claudian may have known of these traditions is lost.

Justin Martyr (2nd century AD) alludes to children of Pluto, but neither names nor enumerates them. Hesychius (5th century AD) mentions a &quot;son of Pluto.&quot; In his 14th-century mythography, Boccaccio records a tradition in which Pluto was the father of the divine personification Veneratio (&quot;Reverence&quot;), noting that she had no mother because Proserpina (the Latin name of Persephone) was sterile.

In &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590s), Edmund Spenser invents a daughter for Pluto whom he calls Lucifera. The character&#x27;s name was taken from the 16th-century mythography of Natale Conti, who used it as the Latin translation of Greek &quot;phosphor&quot;, &quot;light-bearer,&quot; a regular epithet of Hecate. Spenser incorporated aspects of the mysteries into &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.

=== Pluto and Orpheus ===

Orpheus was regarded as a founder and prophet of the mysteries called &quot;Orphic,&quot; &quot;Dionysiac,&quot; or &quot;Bacchic.&quot; Mythologized for his ability to entrance even animals and trees with his music, he was also credited in antiquity with the authorship of the lyrics that have survived as the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, among them a hymn to Pluto. Orpheus&#x27;s voice and lyre-playing represented a medium of revelation or higher knowledge for the mystery cults.

In his central myth, Orpheus visits the underworld in the hope of retrieving his bride, Eurydice, relying on the power of his music to charm the king and queen of Hades. Greek narratives of Orpheus&#x27;s descent and performance typically name the ruler of the underworld as &quot;Plouton&quot;, as for instance in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;. The myth demonstrates the importance of Pluto &quot;the Rich&quot; as the possessor of a quest-object. Orpheus performing before Pluto and Persephone was a common subject of ancient and later Western literature and art, and one of the most significant mythological themes of the classical tradition.

The demonstration of Orpheus&#x27;s power depends on the normal obduracy of Pluto; the Augustan poet Horace describes him as incapable of tears. Claudian, however, portrays the steely god as succumbing to Orpheus&#x27;s song so that &quot;with iron cloak he wipes his tears&quot; &quot;(ferrugineo lacrimas deterget amictu)&quot;, an image renewed by Milton in &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; (106–107): &quot;Such notes ... / Drew iron tears down Pluto&#x27;s cheek.&quot;

The Greek writer Lucian (&quot;ca.&quot; 125–after 180 AD) suggests that Pluto&#x27;s love for his wife gave the ruler of the underworld a special sympathy or insight into lovers parted by death. In one of Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;, Pluto questions Protesilaus, the first Greek hero killed in the Trojan War, who wishes to return to the world of the living. &quot;You are then in love with life?&quot;, Pluto asks. &quot;Such lovers we have here in plenty; but they love an object, which none of them can obtain.&quot; Protesilaus explains, like an Orpheus in reverse, that he has left behind a young bride whose memory even the Lethe&#x27;s waters of forgetting have not erased from him. Pluto assures him that death will reunite them someday, but Protesilaus argues that Pluto himself should understand love and its impatience, and reminds the king of his grant to Orpheus and to Alcestis, who took her husband&#x27;s place in death and then was permitted at the insistence of Heracles to return to him. When Persephone intercedes for the dead warrior, Pluto grants the request at once, though allowing only one day for the reunion.

== Mysteries and cult ==

As Pluto gained importance as an embodiment of agricultural wealth within the Eleusinian Mysteries, from the 5th century BC onward the name Hades was increasingly reserved for the underworld as a place. Neither Hades nor Pluto was one of the traditional Twelve Olympians, and Hades seems to have received limited cult, perhaps only at Elis, where the temple was opened once a year. During the time of Plato, the Athenians periodically honored the god called &quot;Plouton&quot; with the &quot;strewing of a couch&quot; &quot;(tên klinên strôsai)&quot;. At Eleusis, &quot;Plouton&quot; had his own priestess. Pluto was worshipped with Persephone as a divine couple at Knidos, Ephesos, Mytilene, and Sparta as well as at Eleusis, where they were known simply as God &quot;()&quot; and Goddess &quot;(Thea)&quot;.

In the ritual texts of the mystery religions preserved by the so-called Orphic or Bacchic gold tablets, from the late 5th century BC onward the name &quot;Hades&quot; appears more frequently than &quot;Plouton&quot;, but in reference to the underground place: &quot;Plouton&quot; is the ruler who presides over it in a harmonious partnership with Persephone. By the end of the 4th century BC, the name &quot;Plouton&quot; appears in Greek metrical inscriptions. Two fragmentary tablets greet Pluto and Persephone jointly, and the divine couple appear as welcoming figures in a metrical epitaph:
I know that even below the earth, if there is indeed a reward for the worthy ones,the first and foremost honors, nurse, shall be yours, next to Persephone and Pluto.
Hesychius identifies Pluto with Eubouleus, but other ancient sources distinguish between these two underworld deities. In the Mysteries Eubouleus plays the role of a torchbearer, possibly a guide for the initiate&#x27;s return. In the view of Lewis Richard Farnell, Eubouleus was originally a title referring to the &quot;good counsel&quot; the ruler of the underworld was able to give and which was sought at Pluto&#x27;s dream oracles; by the 2nd century BC, however, he had acquired a separate identity.

=== &quot;Orphic Hymn to Pluto&quot; ===
The &quot;Orphic Hymn to Pluto&quot; addresses the god as &quot;strong-spirited&quot; and the &quot;All-Receiver&quot; who commands death and is the master of mortals. His titles are given as &quot;Zeus Chthonios&quot; and &quot;Euboulos&quot; (&quot;Good Counsel&quot;). In the hymn&#x27;s topography, Pluto&#x27;s dwelling is in Tartarus, simultaneously a &quot;meadow&quot; and &quot;thick-shaded and dark,&quot; where the Acheron encircles &quot;the roots of the earth.&quot; &quot;Hades&quot; is again the name of the place, here described as &quot;windless,&quot; and its gates, through which Pluto carried &quot;pure Demeter&#x27;s daughter&quot; as his bride, are located in an Attic cave within the district of Eleusis. The route from Persephone&#x27;s meadow to Hades crosses the sea. The hymn concludes:

You alone were born to judge deeds obscure and conspicuous.Holiest and illustrious ruler of all, frenzied god,You delight in the worshiper&#x27;s respect and reverence.Come with favor and joy to the initiates. I summon you.
The hymn is one of several examples of Greco-Roman prayer that express a desire for the presence of a deity, and has been compared to a similar epiclesis in the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot;.

=== Magic invocations ===
The names of both Hades and Pluto appear also in the Greek Magical Papyri and curse tablets, with Hades typically referring to the underworld as a place, and Pluto regularly invoked as the partner of Persephone. Five Latin curse tablets from Rome, dating to the mid-1st century BC, promise Persephone and Pluto an offering of &quot;dates, figs, and a black pig&quot; if the curse is fulfilled by the desired deadline. The pig was a characteristic animal sacrifice to chthonic deities, whose victims were almost always black or dark in color.

A set of curse tablets written in Doric Greek and found in a tomb addresses a Pasianax, &quot;Lord to All,&quot; sometimes taken as a title of Pluto, but more recently thought to be a magical name for the corpse. &quot;Pasianax&quot; is found elsewhere as an epithet of Zeus, or in the tablets may invoke a &quot;daimon&quot; like Abrasax.

=== Sanctuaries of Pluto ===

A sanctuary dedicated to Pluto was called a ploutonion (Latin &quot;plutonium&quot;). The complex at Eleusis for the mysteries had a ploutonion regarded as the birthplace of the divine child Ploutos, in another instance of conflation or close association of the two gods. Greek inscriptions record an altar of Pluto, which was to be &quot;plastered&quot;, that is, resurfaced for a new round of sacrifices at Eleusis. One of the known ploutonia was in the sacred grove between Tralleis and Nysa, where a temple of Pluto and Persephone was located. Visitors sought healing and dream oracles. The ploutonion at Hierapolis, Phrygia, was connected to the rites of Cybele, but during the Roman Imperial era was subsumed by the cult of Apollo, as confirmed by archaeological investigations during the 1960s. It too was a dream oracle. The sites often seem to have been chosen because the presence of naturally occurring was thought to indicate an opening to the underworld. In Italy, Avernus was considered an entrance to the underworld that produced toxic vapors, but Strabo seems not to think that it was a ploutonion.

== Iconography and attributes ==
=== In Eleusinian scenes ===
Kevin Clinton attempted to distinguish the iconography of Hades, Plouton, Ploutos, and the Eleusinian &quot;Theos&quot; in 5th-century vase painting that depicts scenes from or relating to the mysteries. In Clinton&#x27;s schema, Plouton is a mature man, sometimes even white-haired; Hades is also usually bearded and mature, but his darkness is emphasized in literary descriptions, represented in art by dark hair. Plouton&#x27;s most common attribute is a sceptre, but he also often holds a full or overflowing cornucopia; Hades sometimes holds a horn, but it is depicted with no contents and should be understood as a drinking horn. Unlike Plouton, Hades never holds agrarian attributes such as stalks of grain. His chest is usually bare or only partly covered, whereas Plouton is fully robed (exceptions, however, are admitted by the author). Plouton stands, often in the company of both Demeter and Kore, or sometimes one of the goddesses, but Hades almost always sits or reclines, usually with Persephone facing him. &quot;Confusion and disagreement&quot; about the interpretation of these images remain.

=== The keys of Pluto ===

Attributes of Pluto mentioned in the &quot;Orphic Hymn to Pluto&quot; are his scepter, keys, throne, and horses. In the hymn, the keys are connected to his capacity for giving wealth to humanity, specifically the agricultural wealth of &quot;the year&#x27;s fruits.&quot;
Pausanias explains the significance of Pluto&#x27;s key in describing a wondrously carved cedar chest at the Temple of Hera in Elis. Numerous deities are depicted, with one panel grouping Dionysus, Persephone, the nymphs and Pluto. Pluto holds a key because &quot;they say that what is called Hades has been locked up by Pluto, and that nobody will return back again therefrom.&quot; Natale Conti cites Pausanias in noting that keys are an attribute of Pluto as the scepter is of Jove (Greek Zeus) and the trident of Neptune (Poseidon).

A golden key &quot;(chrusea klês)&quot; was laid on the tongue of initiates by priests at Eleusis and was a symbol of the revelation they were obligated to keep secret. A key is among the attributes of other infernal deities such as Hecate, Anubis, and Persephone, and those who act as guardians or timekeepers, such as Janus and Aion. Aeacus &quot;(Aiakos)&quot;, one of the three mortal kings who became judges in the afterlife, is also a &quot;kleidouchos&quot; (κλειδοῦχος), &quot;holder of the keys,&quot; and a priestly doorkeeper in the court of Pluto and Persephone.

=== Vegetation and color ===
According to the Stoic philosopher Cornutus (1st century AD), Pluto wore a wreath of &quot;phasganion&quot;, more often called &quot;xiphion&quot;, traditionally identified as a type of gladiolus. Dioscorides recorded medical uses for the plant. For extracting stings and thorns, &quot;xiphion&quot; was mixed with wine and frankincense to make a cataplasm. The plant was also used as an aphrodisiac and contraceptive. It grew in humid places. In an obscure passage, Cornutus seems to connect Pluto&#x27;s wearing of &quot;phasganion&quot; to an etymology for Avernus, which he derives from the word for &quot;air,&quot; perhaps through some association with the color &quot;glaukos&quot;, &quot;bluish grey,&quot; &quot;greenish&quot; or &quot;sea-colored,&quot; which might describe the plant&#x27;s leaves. Because the color could describe the sky, Cornutus regularly gives it divine connotations. Pluto&#x27;s twin sister was named Glauca.

Ambiguity of color is characteristic of Pluto. Although both he and his realm are regularly described as dark, black, or gloomy, the god himself is sometimes seen as pale or having a pallor. Martianus Capella (5th century) describes him as both &quot;growing pale in shadow, a fugitive from light&quot; and actively &quot;shedding darkness in the gloom of Tartarean night,&quot; crowned with a wreath made of ebony as suitable for the kingdom he governs. The horses of Pluto are usually black, but Ovid describes them as &quot;sky-colored&quot; (&quot;caeruleus&quot;, from &quot;caelum&quot;, &quot;sky&quot;), which might be blue, greenish-blue, or dark blue.
The Renaissance mythographer Natale Conti says wreaths of narcissus, maidenhair fern &quot;(adianthus)&quot;, and cypress were given to Pluto. In the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;, Gaia (Earth) produced the narcissus at Zeus&#x27;s request as a snare for Persephone; when she grasps it, a chasm opens up and the &quot;Host to Many&quot; (Hades) seizes her. Narcissus wreaths were used in early times to crown Demeter and Persephone, as well as the Furies (Eumenides). The flower was associated with narcotic drugginess (&quot;narkê&quot;, &quot;torpor&quot;), erotic fascination, and imminent death; to dream of crowning oneself with narcissus was a bad sign. In the myth of Narcissus, the flower is created when a beautiful, self-absorbed youth rejects sexuality and is condemned to perpetual self-love along the Styx.

Conti&#x27;s inclusion of &quot;adianthus&quot; (&quot;Adiantum&quot; in modern nomenclature) is less straightforward. The name, meaning &quot;unmoistened&quot; (Greek &quot;adianton&quot;), was taken in antiquity to refer to the fern&#x27;s ability to repel water. The plant, which grew in wet places, was also called &quot;capillus veneris&quot;, &quot;hair of Venus,&quot; divinely dry when she emerged from the sea. Historian of medicine John M. Riddle has suggested that the &quot;adianthus&quot; was one of the ferns Dioscorides called &quot;asplenon&quot; and prescribed as a contraceptive &quot;(atokios)&quot;. The associations of Proserpine (Persephone) and the maidenhair are alluded to by Samuel Beckett in a 1946 poem, in which the self is a Platonic cave with &quot;capillaires&quot;, in French both &quot;maidenhair fern&quot; and &quot;blood vessels&quot;.

The cypress (Greek &quot;cyparissus&quot;, Latin &quot;cupressus&quot;) has traditional associations with mourning. In ancient Attica, households in mourning were garlanded with cypress, and it was used to fumigate the air during cremations. In the myth of Cyparissus, a youth was transformed into a cypress, consumed by grief over the accidental death of a pet stag. A &quot;white cypress&quot; is part of the topography of the underworld that recurs in the Orphic gold tablets as a kind of beacon near the entrance, perhaps to be compared with the Tree of Life in various world mythologies. The description of the cypress as &quot;white&quot; (Greek &quot;leukē&quot;), since the botanical tree is dark, is symbolic, evoking the white garments worn by initiates or the clothing of a corpse, or the pallor of the dead. In Orphic funeral rites, it was forbidden to make coffins of cypress.

The tradition of the mystery religions favors Pluton/Hades as a loving and faithful partner to Persephone, but one ancient myth that preserves a lover for him parallels the abduction and also has a vegetative aspect. A Roman source says that Pluto fell in love with Leuca (Greek &quot;Leukē&quot;, &quot;White&quot;), the most beautiful of the nymphs, and abducted her to live with him in his realm. After the long span of her life came to its end, he memorialized their love by creating a white tree in the Elysian Fields. The tree was the white poplar (Greek &quot;leukē&quot;), the leaves of which are white on one side and dark on the other, representing the duality of upper and underworld. A wreath of white poplar leaves was fashioned by Heracles to mark his ascent from the underworld, an &quot;aition&quot; for why it was worn by initiates and by champion athletes participating in funeral games. Like other plants associated with Pluto, white poplar was regarded as a contraceptive in antiquity. The relation of this tree to the white cypress of the mysteries is debated.

=== The helmet of invisibility ===
The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus uses the name &quot;Plouton&quot; instead of &quot;Hades&quot; in relating the tripartite division of sovereignty, the abduction of Persephone, and the visit of Orpheus to the underworld. This version of the theogony for the most part follows Hesiod (see above), but adds that the three brothers were each given a gift by the Cyclopes to use in their battle against the Titans: Zeus thunder and lightning; Poseidon a trident; and Pluto a helmet &quot;(kyneê)&quot;.

The helmet Pluto receives is presumably the magical Cap of Invisibility &quot;(aidos kyneê)&quot;, but the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; is the only ancient source that explicitly says it belonged to Pluto. The verbal play of &quot;aidos&quot;, &quot;invisible,&quot; and &quot;Hades&quot; is thought to account for this attribution of the helmet to the ruler of the underworld, since no ancient narratives record his use or possession of it. Later authors such as Rabelais (16th century) do attribute the helmet to Pluto. Erasmus calls it the &quot;helmet of Orcus&quot; and gives it as a figure of speech referring to those who conceal their true nature by a cunning device. Francis Bacon notes the proverbial usage: &quot;the helmet of Pluto, which maketh the politic man go invisible, is secrecy in the counsel, and in the execution.&quot;

=== Bident ===

No ancient image of the ruler of the underworld can be said with certainty to show him with a bident, though the ornamented tip of his scepter may have been misunderstood at times as a bident. In the Roman world, the bident (from &quot;bi-&quot;, &quot;two&quot; + &quot;dent-&quot;, &quot;teeth&quot;) was an agricultural implement. It may also represent one of the three types of lightning wielded by Jupiter, the Roman counterpart of Zeus, and the Etruscan Tinia. The later notion that the ruler of the underworld wielded a trident or bident can perhaps be traced to a line in Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Hercules Furens&quot; (&quot;Hercules Enraged&quot;), in which Father Dis, the Roman counterpart of Pluto, uses a three-pronged spear to drive off Hercules as he attempts to invade Pylos. Seneca calls Dis the &quot;Infernal Jove&quot; or the &quot;dire Jove&quot; (the Jove who gives dire or ill omens, &quot;dirae)&quot;, just as in the Greek tradition, &quot;Plouton&quot; is sometimes identified as a &quot;chthonic Zeus.&quot; That the trident and bident might be somewhat interchangeable is suggested by a Byzantine scholiast, who mentions Poseidon being armed with a bident.

In the Middle Ages, classical underworld figures began to be depicted with a pitchfork. Early Christian writers had identified the classical underworld with Hell, and its denizens as demons or devils. In the Renaissance, the bident became a conventional attribute of Pluto. In an influential ceiling mural depicting the wedding of Cupid and Psyche, painted by Raphael&#x27;s workshop for the Villa Farnesina in 1517, Pluto is shown holding the bident, with Cerberus at his side, while Neptune holds the trident. Perhaps influenced by this work, Agostino Carracci originally depicted Pluto with a bident in a preparatory drawing for his painting &quot;Pluto&quot; (1592), in which the god ended up holding his characteristic key. In Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Giove, Nettuno e Plutone&quot; (ca. 1597), a ceiling mural based on alchemical allegory, it is Neptune who holds the bident.

== In Greek literature and philosophy ==

The name &quot;Plouton&quot; is first used in Greek literature by Athenian playwrights. In Aristophanes&#x27; comedy &quot;The Frogs&quot; (&quot;Batrachoi&quot;, 405 BC), in which &quot;the Eleusinian colouring is in fact so pervasive,&quot; the ruler of the underworld is one of the characters, under the name of &quot;Plouton&quot;. The play depicts a mock descent to the underworld by the god Dionysus to bring back one of the dead tragic playwrights in the hope of restoring Athenian theater to its former glory. Pluto is a silent presence onstage for about 600 lines presiding over a contest among the tragedians, then announces that the winner has the privilege of returning to the upper world. The play also draws on beliefs and imagery from Orphic and Dionysiac cult, and rituals pertaining to Ploutos (Plutus, &quot;wealth&quot;). In a fragment from another play by Aristophanes, a character &quot;is comically singing of the excellent aspects of being dead&quot;, asking in reference to the tripartition of sovereignty over the world:
&lt;poem&gt;
And where do you think Pluto gets his name [i.e. &quot;rich&quot;],
if not because he took the best portion?
How much better are things below than what Zeus possesses!
&lt;/poem&gt;

To Plato, the god of the underworld was &quot;an agent in [the] beneficent cycle of death and rebirth&quot; meriting worship under the name of &quot;Plouton&quot;, a giver of spiritual wealth. In the dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot;, Plato has Socrates explain the etymology of &quot;Plouton&quot;, saying that Pluto gives wealth (&quot;ploutos&quot;), and his name means &quot;giver of wealth, which comes out of the earth beneath&quot;. Because the name Hades is taken to mean &quot;the invisible&quot;, people fear what they cannot see; although they are in error about the nature of this deity&#x27;s power, Socrates says, &quot;the office and name of the God really correspond&quot;:

He is the perfect and accomplished Sophist, and the great benefactor of the inhabitants of the other world; and even to us who are upon earth he sends from below exceeding blessings. For he has much more than he wants down there; wherefore he is called Pluto (or the rich). Note also, that he will have nothing to do with men while they are in the body, but only when the soul is liberated from the desires and evils of the body. Now there is a great deal of philosophy and reflection in that; for in their liberated state he can bind them with the desire of virtue, but while they are flustered and maddened by the body, not even father Cronos himself would suffice to keep them with him in his own far-famed chains.

Since &quot;the union of body and soul is not better than the loosing,&quot; death is not an evil. Walter Burkert thus sees Pluto as a &quot;god of dissolution.&quot; Among the titles of Pluto was &quot;Isodaitēs&quot;, &quot;divider into equal portions,&quot; a title that connects him to the fate goddesses the Moirai. &quot;Isodaitēs&quot; was also a cult title for Dionysus and Helios.

In ordering his ideal city, Plato proposed a calendar in which Pluto was honored as a benefactor in the twelfth month, implicitly ranking him as one of the twelve principal deities. In the Attic calendar, the twelfth month, more or less equivalent to June, was Skirophorion; the name may be connected to the rape of Persephone.

== Theogonies and cosmology ==
=== Euhemerism and Latinization ===
In the theogony of Euhemerus (4th century BC), the gods were treated as mortal rulers whose deeds were immortalized by tradition. Ennius translated Euhemerus into Latin about a hundred years later, and a passage from his version was in turn preserved by the early Christian writer Lactantius. Here the union of Saturn (the Roman equivalent of Cronus) and Ops, an Italic goddess of abundance, produces Jupiter (Greek Zeus), Juno (Hera), Neptune, Pluto, and Glauca:

Then Saturn took Ops to wife. Titan, the elder brother, demanded the kingship for himself. Vesta their mother, with their sisters Ceres [Demeter] and Ops, persuaded Saturn not to give way to his brother in the matter. Titan was less good-looking than Saturn; for that reason, and also because he could see his mother and sisters working to have it so, he conceded the kingship to Saturn, and came to terms with him: if Saturn had a male child born to him, it would not be reared. This was done to secure reversion of the kingship to Titan&#x27;s children. They then killed the first son that was born to Saturn. Next came twin children, Jupiter and Juno. Juno was given to Saturn to see while Jupiter was secretly removed and given to Vesta to be brought up without Saturn&#x27;s knowledge. In the same way without Saturn knowing, Ops bore Neptune and hid him away. In her third labor Ops bore another set of twins, Pluto and Glauce. (Pluto in Latin is Dis pater; some call him Orcus.) Saturn was shown his daughter Glauce but his son Pluto was hidden and removed. Glauce then died young. That is the pedigree, as written, of Jupiter and his brothers; that is how it has been passed down to us in holy scripture.
In this theogony, which Ennius introduced into Latin literature, Saturn, &quot;Titan,&quot; Vesta, Ceres, and Ops are siblings; Glauca is the twin of Pluto and dies mysteriously young. There are several mythological figures named Glauca; the sister of Pluto may be the Glauca who in Cicero&#x27;s account of the three aspects of Diana conceived the third with the equally mysterious Upis. This is the genealogy for Pluto that Boccaccio used in his &quot;Genealogia Deorum Gentilium&quot; and in his lectures explicating the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; of Dante.

In Book 3 of the Sibylline Oracles, dating mostly to the 2nd century AD, Rhea gives birth to Pluto as she passes by Dodona, &quot;where the watery paths of the River Europus flowed, and the water ran into the sea, merged with the Peneius. This is also called the Stygian river.&quot;

=== Orphic and philosophical systems ===
The Orphic theogonies are notoriously varied, and Orphic cosmology influenced the varying Gnostic theogonies of late antiquity. Clementine literature (4th century AD) preserves a theogony with explicit Orphic influence that also draws on Hesiod, yielding a distinctive role for Pluto. When the primordial elements came together by orderly cyclonic force, they produced a generative sphere, the &quot;egg&quot; from which the primeval Orphic entity Phanes is born and the world is formed. The release of Phanes and his ascent to the heavenly top of the world-egg causes the matter left in the sphere to settle in relation to weight, creating the tripartite world of the traditional theogonies:
Its lower part, the heaviest element, sinks downwards, and is called Pluto because of its gravity, weight, and great quantity (&quot;plêthos&quot;) of matter. After the separation of this heavy element in the middle part of the egg the waters flow together, which they call Poseidon. The purest and noblest element, the fire, is called Zeus, because its nature is glowing (ζέουσα, &quot;zeousa&quot;). It flies right up into the air, and draws up the spirit, now called Metis, that was left in the underlying moisture. And when this spirit has reached the summit of the ether, it is devoured by Zeus, who in his turn begets the intelligence (σύνεσις, &quot;sunesis&quot;), also called Pallas. And by this artistic intelligence the etherial artificer creates the whole world. This world is surrounded by the air, which extends from Zeus, the very hot ether, to the earth; this air is called Hera.
This cosmogony interprets Hesiod allegorically, and so the heaviest element is identified not as the Earth, but as the netherworld of Pluto. (In modern geochemistry, plutonium is the heaviest primordial element.) Supposed etymologies are used to make sense of the relation of physical process to divine name; &quot;Plouton&quot; is here connected to &quot;plêthos&quot; (abundance).

In the Stoic system, Pluto represented the lower region of the air, where according to Seneca (1st century AD) the soul underwent a kind of purgatory before ascending to the ether. Seneca&#x27;s contemporary Cornutus made use of the traditional etymology of Pluto&#x27;s name for Stoic theology. The Stoics believed that the form of a word contained the original truth of its meaning, which over time could become corrupted or obscured. &quot;Plouton&quot; derived from &quot;ploutein&quot;, &quot;to be wealthy,&quot; Cornutus said, because &quot;all things are corruptible and therefore are &#x27;ultimately consigned to him as his property.&#x27;&quot;

Within the Pythagorean and Neoplatonic traditions, Pluto was allegorized as the region where souls are purified, located between the Moon (as represented by Persephone) and the Sun. Neoplatonists sometimes interpreted the Eleusinian Mysteries as a &quot;fabula&quot; of celestial phenomena:
Authors tell the fable that Ceres was Proserpina&#x27;s mother, and that Proserpina while playing one day was kidnapped by Pluto. Her mother searched for her with lighted torches; and it was decreed by Jupiter that the mother should have her daughter for fifteen days in the month, but Pluto for the rest, the other fifteen. This is nothing but that the name Ceres is used to mean the earth, called Ceres on analogy with &quot;crees&quot; (&#x27;you may create&#x27;), for all things are created from her. By Proserpina is meant the moon, and her name is on analogy with &quot;prope serpens&quot; (&#x27;creeping near&#x27;), for she is moved nearer to the earth than the other planets. She is called earth&#x27;s daughter, because her substance has more of earth in it than of the other elements. By Pluto is meant the shadow that sometimes obstructs the moon.
==== Plouton Helios ====

A dedicatory inscription from Smyrna describes a 1st–2nd century sanctuary to &quot;God Himself&quot; as the most exalted of a group of six deities, including clothed statues of &quot;Plouton Helios&quot; and &quot;Koure Selene&quot;, &quot;Pluto the Sun&quot; and &quot;Kore the Moon.&quot; The status of Pluto and Kore as a divine couple is marked by what the text describes as a &quot;linen embroidered bridal curtain.&quot; The two are placed as bride and groom within an enclosed temple, separately from the other deities cultivated at the sanctuary.

&quot;Plouton Helios&quot; is mentioned in other literary sources in connection with &quot;Koure Selene&quot; and &quot;Helios Apollon&quot;; the sun on its nighttime course was sometimes envisioned as traveling through the underworld on its return to the east. Apuleius describes a rite in which the sun appears at midnight to the initiate at the gates of Proserpina; it has been suggested that this midnight sun could be &quot;Plouton Helios&quot;.

The Smyrna inscription also records the presence of &quot;Helios Apollon&quot; at the sanctuary. As two forms of Helios, Apollo and Pluto pose a dichotomy:

It has been argued that the sanctuary was in the keeping of a Pythagorean sodality or &quot;brotherhood&quot;. The relation of Orphic beliefs to the mystic strand of Pythagoreanism, or of these to Platonism and Neoplatonism, is complex and much debated.

==== Plutonius ====

In the Hellenistic era, the title or epithet &quot;Plutonius&quot; is sometimes affixed to the names of other deities. In the Hermetic Corpus, Jupiter Plutonius &quot;rules over earth and sea, and it is he who nourishes mortal things that have soul and bear fruit.&quot;

In Ptolemaic Alexandria, at the site of a dream oracle, Serapis was identified with Aion Plutonius. Gilles Quispel conjectured that this figure results from the integration of the Orphic Phanes into Mithraic religion at Alexandria, and that he &quot;assures the eternity of the city,&quot; where the birth of Aion was celebrated at the sanctuary of Kore on 6 January. In Latin, &quot;Plutonius&quot; can be an adjective that simply means &quot;of or pertaining to Pluto.&quot;

==== Neoplatonic demiurge ====
The Neoplatonist Proclus (5th century AD) considered Pluto the third demiurge, a sublunar demiurge who was also identified variously with Poseidon or Hephaestus. This idea is present in Renaissance Neoplatonism, as for instance in the cosmology of Marsilio Ficino (1433–99), who translated Orphic texts into Latin for his own use. Ficino saw the sublunar demiurge as &quot;a daemonic &#x27;many-headed&#x27; sophist, a magus, an enchanter, a fashioner of images and reflections, a shape-changer of himself and of others, a poet in a way of being and of not-being, a royal Pluto.&quot; This demiurgic figure identified with Pluto is also &quot;&#x27;a purifier of souls&#x27; who presides over the magic of love and generation and who uses a fantastic counter-art to mock, but also ... to supplement, the divine icastic or truly imitative art of the sublime translunar Demiurge.&quot;

== In Western art and literature ==

=== Christianization ===
Christian writers of late antiquity sought to discredit the competing gods of Roman and Hellenistic religions, often adopting the euhemerizing approach in regarding them not as divinities, but as people glorified through stories and cultic practices and thus not true deities worthy of worship. The infernal gods, however, retained their potency, becoming identified with the Devil and treated as demonic forces by Christian apologists.

One source of Christian revulsion toward the chthonic gods was the arena. Attendants in divine costume, among them a &quot;Pluto&quot; who escorted corpses out, were part of the ceremonies of the gladiatorial games. Tertullian calls the mallet-wielding figure usually identified as the Etruscan Charun the &quot;brother of Jove,&quot; that is, Hades/Pluto/Dis, an indication that the distinctions among these denizens of the underworld were becoming blurred in a Christian context. Prudentius, in his poetic polemic against the religious traditionalist Symmachus, describes the arena as a place where savage vows were fulfilled on an altar to Pluto &quot;(solvit ad aram / Plutonis fera vota)&quot;, where fallen gladiators were human sacrifices to Dis and Charon received their souls as his payment, to the delight of the underworld Jove &quot;(Iovis infernalis)&quot;.

=== Medieval mythography ===
Medieval mythographies, written in Latin, continue the conflation of Greek and Roman deities begun by the ancient Romans themselves. Perhaps because the name Pluto was used in both traditions, it appears widely in these Latin sources for the classical ruler of the underworld, who is also seen as the double, ally, or adjunct to the figure in Christian mythology known variously as the Devil, Satan, or Lucifer. The classical underworld deities became casually interchangeable with Satan as an embodiment of Hell. For instance, in the 9th century, Abbo Cernuus, the only witness whose account of the Siege of Paris survives, called the invading Vikings the &quot;spawn of Pluto.&quot;

In the &quot;Little Book on Images of the Gods&quot;, Pluto is described as

an intimidating personage sitting on a throne of sulphur, holding the scepter of his realm in his right hand, and with his left strangling a soul. Under his feet three-headed Cerberus held a position, and beside him he had three Harpies. From his golden throne of sulphur flowed four rivers, which were called, as is known, Lethe, Cocytus, Phlegethon and Acheron, tributaries of the Stygian swamp.

This work derives from that of the Third Vatican Mythographer, possibly one Albricus or Alberic, who presents often extensive allegories and devotes his longest chapter, including an excursus on the nature of the soul, to Pluto.

=== Medieval and Renaissance literature ===

In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (written 1308–1321), Pluto presides over the fourth circle of Hell, to which the greedy are condemned. The Italian form of the name is &quot;Pluto&quot;, taken by some commentators to refer specifically to Plutus as the god of wealth who would preside over the torment of those who hoarded or squandered it in life. Dante&#x27;s Pluto is greeted as &quot;the great enemy&quot; and utters the famously impenetrable line &quot;Papé Satàn, papé Satàn aleppe&quot;. Much of this Canto is devoted to the power of Fortuna to give and take away. Entrance into the fourth circle has marked a downward turn in the poet&#x27;s journey, and the next landmark after he and his guide cross from the circle is the Stygian swamp, through which they pass on their way to the city of Dis (Italian &quot;Dite&quot;). Dante&#x27;s clear distinction between Pluto and Dis suggests that he had Plutus in mind in naming the former. The city of Dis is the &quot;citadel of Lower Hell&quot; where the walls are garrisoned by fallen angels and Furies. Pluto is treated likewise as a purely Satanic figure by the 16th-century Italian poet Tasso throughout his epic &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;, in which &quot;great Dis, great Pluto&quot; is invoked in the company of &quot;all ye devils that lie in deepest hell.&quot;

Influenced by Ovid and Claudian, Geoffrey Chaucer (1343–1400) developed the myth of Pluto and Proserpina (the Latin name of Persephone) in English literature. Like earlier medieval writers, Chaucer identifies Pluto&#x27;s realm with Hell as a place of condemnation and torment, and describes it as &quot;derk and lowe&quot; (&quot;dark and low&quot;). But Pluto&#x27;s major appearance in the works of Chaucer comes as a character in &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Tale,&quot; where Pluto is identified as the &quot;Kyng of Fayerye&quot; (Fairy King). As in the anonymous romance &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; (&quot;ca.&quot; 1300), Pluto and Proserpina rule over a fantastical world that melds classical myth and fairyland. Chaucer has the couple engage in a comic that undermines the Christian imagery in the tale, which is Chaucer&#x27;s most sexually explicit. The Scottish poet William Dunbar &quot;ca.&quot; 1503 also described Pluto as a folkloric supernatural being, &quot;the elrich incubus / in cloke of grene&quot; (&quot;the incubus in cloak of green&quot;), who appears among the courtiers of Cupid.

The name &quot;Pluto&quot; for the classical ruler of the underworld was further established in English literature by Arthur Golding, whose translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (1565) was of great influence on William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Edmund Spenser. Golding translates Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Dis&quot; as Pluto, a practice that prevails among English translators, despite John Milton&#x27;s use of the Latin &quot;Dis&quot; in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The Christian perception of the classical underworld as Hell influenced Golding&#x27;s translation practices; for instance, Ovid&#x27;s &quot;tenebrosa sede tyrannus / exierat&quot; (&quot;the tyrant &quot;[Dis]&quot; had gone out of his shadowy realm&quot;) becomes &quot;the prince of fiends forsook his darksome hole&quot;.

Pluto&#x27;s court as a literary setting could bring together a motley assortment of characters. In Huon de Méry&#x27;s 13th-century poem &quot;The Tournament of the Antichrist&quot;, Pluto rules over a congregation of &quot;classical gods and demigods, biblical devils, and evil Christians.&quot; In the 15th-century dream allegory &quot;The Assembly of Gods&quot;, the deities and personifications are &quot;apparelled as medieval nobility&quot; basking in the &quot;magnyfycence&quot; of their &quot;lord Pluto,&quot; who is clad in a &quot;smoky net&quot; and reeking of sulphur.

Throughout the Renaissance, images and ideas from classical antiquity entered popular culture through the new medium of print and through pageants and other public performances at festivals. The Fête-Dieu at Aix-en-Provence in 1462 featured characters costumed as a number of classical deities, including Pluto, and Pluto was the subject of one of seven pageants presented as part of the 1521 Midsummer Eve festival in London. During the 15th century, no mythological theme was brought to the stage more often than Orpheus&#x27;s descent, with the court of Pluto inspiring fantastical stagecraft. Leonardo da Vinci designed a set with a rotating mountain that opened up to reveal Pluto emerging from the underworld; the drawing survives and was the basis for a modern recreation.

=== Opera and ballet ===
The tragic descent of the hero-musician Orpheus to the underworld to retrieve his bride, and his performance at the court of Pluto and Proserpina, offered compelling material for librettists and composers of opera (see List of Orphean operas) and ballet. Pluto also appears in works based on other classical myths of the underworld. As a singing role, Pluto is almost always written for a bass voice, with the low vocal range representing the depths and weight of the underworld, as in Monteverdi and Rinuccini&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (1607) and &quot;Il ballo delle ingrate&quot; (1608). In their &quot;ballo&quot;, a form of ballet with vocal numbers, Cupid invokes Pluto from the underworld to lay claim to &quot;ungrateful&quot; women who were immune to love. Pluto&#x27;s part is considered particularly virtuosic, and a reviewer at the première described the character, who appeared as if from a blazing Inferno, as &quot;formidable and awesome in sight, with garments as given him by poets, but burdened with gold and jewels.&quot;
The role of Pluto is written for a bass in Peri&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot; (1600); Caccini&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot; (1602); Rossi&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo&quot; (1647); Cesti&#x27;s &quot;Il pomo d&#x27;oro&quot; (1668); Sartoris&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo&quot; (1672); Lully&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot;, a &quot;tragédie en musique&quot; (1674); Charpentier&#x27;s chamber opera &quot;La descente d&#x27;Orphée aux enfers&quot; (1686); Telemann&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus&quot; (1726); and Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot; (1733). Pluto was a baritone in Lully&#x27;s &quot;Proserpine&quot; (1680), which includes a duo dramatizing the conflict between the royal underworld couple that is notable for its early use of musical characterization. Perhaps the most famous of the Orpheus operas is Offenbach&#x27;s satiric &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; (1858), in which a tenor sings the role of &quot;Pluton&quot;, disguised in the giddily convoluted plotting as Aristée (Aristaeus), a farmer.

Scenes set in Pluto&#x27;s realm were orchestrated with instrumentation that became conventionally &quot;hellish&quot;, established in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; as two cornets, three trombones, a bassoon, and a régale.

Pluto has also been featured as a role in ballet. In Lully&#x27;s &quot;Ballet of Seven Planets&#x27;&quot; interlude from Cavalli&#x27;s opera &quot;Ercole amante&quot; (&quot;Hercules in Love&quot;), Louis XIV himself danced as Pluto and other characters; it was a spectacular flop. Pluto appeared in Noverre&#x27;s lost &quot;La descente d&#x27;Orphée aux Enfers&quot; (1760s). Gaétan Vestris danced the role of the god in Florian Deller&#x27;s &quot;Orefeo ed Euridice&quot; (1763). The &quot;Persephone&quot; choreographed by Robert Joffrey (1952) was based on André Gide&#x27;s line &quot;king of winters, the infernal Pluto.&quot;

=== Fine art ===
The abduction of Proserpina by Pluto was the scene from the myth most often depicted by artists, who usually follow Ovid&#x27;s version. The influential emblem book &quot;Iconologia&quot; of Cesare Ripa (1593, second edition 1603) presents the allegorical figure of Rape with a shield on which the abduction is painted. Jacob Isaacsz. van Swanenburg, the first teacher of Rembrandt, echoed Ovid in showing Pluto as the target of Cupid&#x27;s arrow while Venus watches her plan carried out (location of painting unknown). The treatment of the scene by Rubens is similar. Rembrandt incorporates Claudian&#x27;s more passionate characterizations. The performance of Orpheus in the court of Pluto and Proserpina was also a popular subject.

Major artists who produced works depicting Pluto include:
* Dürer, &quot;Abduction of Proserpine on a Unicorn&quot; (1516), etching. Dürer&#x27;s first English biographer called this work &quot;a wild, weird conception&quot; that &quot;produces a most uncomfortable, shuddering impression on the beholder.&quot; The source or significance of the unicorn as the form of transport is unclear; Dürer&#x27;s preparatory drawing showed a conventional horse. Pluto seems to be presented in a manner that recalls the leader of the Wild Hunt.
*Caravaggio, &quot;Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto&quot; (Italian &quot;Giove, Nettuno e Plutone&quot;, &quot;ca.&quot; 1597), a ceiling mural (pictured under Theogonies and cosmology above) intended for viewing from below, hence the unusual perspective. Caravaggio created the work for a room adjacent to the alchemical distillery of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, his most important patron. The three gods hover around a translucent globe that represents the world: Jupiter with his eagle, Neptune holding a bident, and Pluto accompanied by a bluish-gray horse and a Cerberus who resembles a three-headed border collie more than a hellhound. In addition to personifying the classical elements air, water, and earth, the three figures represent &quot;an allegory of the applied science of alchemy&quot;.
* Jan Brueghel the Elder, &quot;Orpheus before Pluto and Proserpina&quot; (1604), painting.
* Bernini, &quot;Pluto and Proserpina&quot; (1621–22), also known as &quot;The Rape of Proserpina&quot;, sculpture with a Cerberus looking in three different directions.
* Rembrandt, &quot;Abduction of Proserpina&quot; (&quot;ca.&quot; 1631), painting influenced by Rubens (via the engraving of his student Pieter Soutman). Rembrandt&#x27;s leonine Pluto draws on Claudian&#x27;s description of the god as like a ravening lion.

=== Modern literature ===
After the Renaissance, literary interest in the abduction myth waned until the revival of classical myth among the Romantics. The work of mythographers such as J.G. Frazer and Jane Ellen Harrison helped inspire the recasting of myths in modern terms by Victorian and Modernist writers. In &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1891), Thomas Hardy portrays Alec d&#x27;Urberville as &quot;a grotesque parody of Pluto/Dis&quot; exemplifying the late-Victorian culture of male domination, in which women were consigned to &quot;an endless breaking ... on the wheel of biological reproduction.&quot; A similar figure is found in &quot;The Lost Girl&quot; (1920) by D.H. Lawrence, where the character Ciccio acts as Pluto to Alvina&#x27;s Persephone, &quot;the deathly-lost bride ... paradoxically obliterated and vitalised at the same time by contact with Pluto/Dis&quot; in &quot;a prelude to the grand design of rebirth.&quot; The darkness of Pluto is both a source of regeneration, and of &quot;merciless annihilation.&quot; Lawrence takes up the theme elsewhere in his work; in &quot;The First Lady Chatterley&quot; (1926, an early version of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;), Connie Chatterley sees herself as a Persephone and declares &quot;she&#x27;d rather be married to Pluto than Plato,&quot; casting her earthy gamekeeper lover as the former and her philosophy-spouting husband as the latter.

In Rick Riordan&#x27;s young adult fantasy series &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot;, the character Hazel Levesque is the daughter of Pluto, god of riches. She is one of seven characters with a parent from classical mythology.

<text>John Dezso Ratzenberger (born April 6, 1947) is an American actor. He is best known for playing the character Cliff Clavin on the comedy series &quot;Cheers&quot;, for which he earned two Primetime Emmy nominations. Ratzenberger reprised the role in the short-lived spin-off &quot;The Tortellis&quot;, an episode of &quot;Wings,&quot; as well as in an episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;. He has voiced various characters in several Pixar animated feature films including Hamm in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, The Abominable Snowman in the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; franchise, Mack in the &quot;Cars&quot; franchise, The Underminer in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; franchise, Fritz in the &quot;Inside Out&quot; franchise, and many others.

Ratzenberger began his entertainment career while living in London in the 1970s. He acted in and wrote film and television through the 1970s and early 1980s before returning to America. At an audition for a role in a new sitcom, Ratzenberger created the character of Cliff Clavin. &quot;Cheers&quot; (1982–1993) was a success and went on to run for 11 years. After &quot;Cheers&quot;, he began voicing characters for Pixar; Ratzenberger&#x27;s first role was Hamm in Pixar&#x27;s debut feature film &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), and he would continue to voice characters in many subsequent Pixar films. Including voice acting and cameos, he is the third highest-grossing actor of all time.

==Early life==
John Dezso Ratzenberger was born on Easter Sunday, April 6, 1947, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the son of Bertha Veronica (&quot;née&quot; Grochowski), and Dezso Alexander Ratzenberger, a WWII veteran who had been a combat engineer in the Philippines. John&#x27;s father, Dezso, was of Austrian and Hungarian descent, and John&#x27;s mother was of Polish ancestry. Ratzenberger attended St. Ann&#x27;s School and Bassick High School in Bridgeport and then Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut. In 1969, Ratzenberger worked at the Woodstock Festival as a heavy equipment operator and as part of the crew building the stage. John moved to London in 1971, where he began his acting, writing, and directing career.

==Career==

Ratzenberger began his career in the performing arts while living in London, England. Through the 1970s, he performed with Ray Hassett as the comedic theatrical duo Sal&#x27;s Meat Market, which toured throughout Europe for eight years. Sal&#x27;s Meat Market heavily influenced Peter Richardson and Nigel Planer as a duo in &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and in &quot;The Comic Strip&quot;. His first role in a major feature film was as a patron in &quot;The Ritz&quot; (1976). Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Ratzenberger appeared in various roles in feature films throughout Europe including: &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, filmed in Holland, as Lieutenant James Megellas; &quot;Superman&quot;, as a missile controller; &quot;Superman II&quot;, as the NASA control man; &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; as Major Derlin; &quot;Outland&quot; as a doomed mine worker named Tarlow; and &quot;Gandhi,&quot; filmed in India, playing an American lieutenant.

=== &quot;Cheers&quot; ===
Ratzenberger played mail carrier Cliff Clavin on the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. As an improv artist, he asked the producers if they had written a bar know-it-all character; the producers decided it was a great idea, and the character of Cliff Clavin was born. Ratzenberger also came up with the idea for Cliff&#x27;s trademark white socks, which he wore as a tribute to French comedian Jacques Tati. Cliff became known for his outlandish stories, trivia, and his trademarked (and oft repeated), &quot;It&#x27;s a little known fact...&quot; Cliff and Norm, the primary customer characters of the iconic bar, Cheers, played buddies who met at Cheers to talk about the day or nothing in particular. Ratzenberger was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1985 and again in 1986. Ratzenberger provided the voice for an animated version of Cliff on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; sixth-season episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;. He also played the role in the short-lived spin-off &quot;The Tortellis&quot; and in an episode of &quot;Wings&quot;, which was made by the same creators.

===Voice work===
Ratzenberger has contributed voice work for several animated projects, most notably Pixar productions.

Ratzenberger has voiced characters in 23 Pixar films. His roles include:
*Hamm the piggy bank in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; series (1995, 1999, 2010, 2019)
*P.T. Flea, the Circus Ring Leader in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998)
*Yeti the Abominable Snowman in the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; series (2001, 2013)
*The school of Moonfish in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003)
*The Underminer in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; series (2004, 2018)
*Mack the truck in the &quot;Cars&quot; series (2006, 2011, 2017)
*Mustafa the waiter in &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007)
*John the Axiom passenger in &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008)
*Tom the construction worker in &quot;Up&quot; (2009)
*Gordon the Dunbroch palace guard in &quot;Brave&quot; (2012)
*Fritz the mind worker in the &quot;Inside Out&quot; series (2015, 2024)

*Bill the crab in &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016)
*Juan Ortodoncia the deceased dental patient in &quot;Coco&quot; (2017)
*Fennwick the cyclops construction worker in &quot;Onward&quot; (2020)
According to Ratzenberger, Pixar&#x27;s tradition of including him as a good luck charm in every film beginning with the studio&#x27;s first film, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, was due to him being good friends with former Pixar filmmaker John Lasseter, who directed or executive-produced each of the first 20 Pixar films. Ratzenberger&#x27;s tenure at Pixar was parodied during the end credits of &quot;Cars&quot;, where his character, Mack, watches car-themed versions of Pixar films (&quot;Toy Car Story&quot;, &quot;Monster Trucks, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, the latter of which references the Volkswagen Beetle). Mack notes that all the characters that John Ratzenberger has played had excellent voice actors until he realizes that they are performed by the same actor, at which point he remarks, &quot;They&#x27;re just using the same actor over and over,&quot; and asks, &quot;What kind of a cut-rate production is this?!&quot; Ratzenberger stated his favorite Pixar role was Hamm from the &quot;Toy Story&quot; series, and he has given honorable mention to P.T. Flea from &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;.

Following Lasseter&#x27;s exit from Pixar, Ratzenberger revealed he was not a fan of the regime that replaced Lasseter or the studio&#x27;s subsequent films, claiming &quot;[...] they suck&quot;, and was critical of the political messaging that he felt was being placed in the films. Pixar&#x27;s 23rd feature film, &quot;Soul&quot; (2020), was the first Pixar film that did not involve Ratzenberger himself, though it did instead feature a character animated in his likeness as a cameo according to the film’s co-director Kemp Powers; the cameo was also confirmed by director Pete Docter on the film&#x27;s audio commentary track. After having voiced a character in every Pixar film from &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995) through &quot;Onward&quot; (2020), Ratzenberger would not have another role in any Pixar film until their 28th feature film, &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; (2024).

Ratzenberger has continued to work with Lasseter, who produces all feature films and executive-produces all series at Skydance Animation. His roles include: 
*Rootie the bad luck root in &quot;Luck&quot; (2022), the studio&#x27;s first feature film
*Caruncle the alien in the first season of &quot;WondLa&quot; (2024), the studio&#x27;s first series
*Milo the monster handler in &quot;Spellbound&quot; (2024), the studio&#x27;s second feature film

Aside from the Pixar and Skydance productions, Ratzenberger voiced Harland the jet tug in Disneytoon Studios&#x27; &quot;Planes&quot; (2013) and Brodi the plane in its sequel, &quot;&quot; (2014), which are spin-offs of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; series and executive-produced by Lasseter. Additionally, Ratzenberger provided the voice for Aniyaku the assistant manager in the English dub version of Studio Ghibli’s &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2002), which Lasseter also executive-produced.

Ratzenberger also reprised his role as Yeti (now named Adorable) and voiced a new character named Bernard in the Disney Television Animation series &quot;Monsters at Work&quot; (2021-24), which is set after the main events of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ratzenberger lived in London for 10 years. Since 1994, he has lived in Vashon, Washington. Ratzenberger married Georgia Stiny in 1984; during their 20-year marriage they had two children together before divorcing in 2004. He then married Julie Blichfeldt in November 2012.

Ratzenberger developed a packaging-alternatives product made from biodegradable and non-toxic recycled paper as a safe alternative to foam peanuts and plastic bubble wrap. This product, SizzlePak, was manufactured by his company Eco-Pak Industries, which Ratzenberger co-founded in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Trib 11/10/92&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he sold Eco-Pack to Ranpak Corp.

===Political views===
Ratzenberger is a Republican. During the 2008 presidential race, Ratzenberger campaigned for John McCain, appearing with former &quot;Cheers&quot; co-star Kelsey Grammer at several Republican party events. Ratzenberger was outspoken in opposition of the 2010 health care reform bill, referring to it as socialism. On January 17, 2010, he appeared and endorsed Scott Brown for the United States Senate at Mechanics Hall in Worcester, Massachusetts. Ratzenberger campaigned for Republican Josh Mandel of Ohio for state treasurer in 2010 and served as master of ceremonies for Mandel&#x27;s inauguration into the position in 2011. He considered running for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut in 2012.

Ratzenberger endorsed Mitt Romney in 2012. He appeared on &quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto&quot; to support Donald Trump&#x27;s candidacy during the 2016 presidential race, shortly after Trump was declared the presumptive Republican nominee. He praised his performance as president in 2017, saying he had done &quot;a wonderful job as far as manufacturing is concerned&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ratzenberger expressed his support for the United States Postal Service (USPS) in 2020 via Cameo and suggested people who wished to help them donate and buy presents for Christmas early.

<text>A tree automaton is a type of state machine. Tree automata deal with tree structures, rather than the strings of more conventional state machines.

The following article deals with branching tree automata, which correspond to regular languages of trees.

As with classical automata, finite tree automata (FTA) can be either a deterministic automaton or not. According to how the automaton processes the input tree, finite tree automata can be of two types: (a) bottom up, (b) top down. This is an important issue, as although non-deterministic (ND) top-down and ND bottom-up tree automata are equivalent in expressive power, deterministic top-down automata are strictly less powerful than their deterministic bottom-up counterparts, because tree properties specified by deterministic top-down tree automata can only depend on path properties. (Deterministic bottom-up tree automata are as powerful as ND tree automata.)

== Definitions ==

A bottom-up finite tree automaton over &quot;F&quot; is defined as a tuple
(&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;&quot;f&quot;, Δ),
where &quot;Q&quot; is a set of states, &quot;F&quot; is a ranked alphabet (i.e., an alphabet whose symbols have an associated arity), is a set of final states, and Δ is a set of transition rules of the form &quot;f&quot;(&quot;q&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;1)...,&quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) → &quot;q&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)), for an &quot;n&quot;-ary , and &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; variables denoting subtrees. That is, members of Δ are rewrite rules from nodes whose childs&#x27; roots are states, to nodes whose roots are states. Thus the state of a node is deduced from the states of its children.

For &quot;n&quot;=0, that is, for a constant symbol &quot;f&quot;, the above transition rule definition reads &quot;f&quot;() → &quot;q&quot;(&quot;f&quot;()); often the empty parentheses are omitted for convenience: &quot;f&quot; → &quot;q&quot;(&quot;f&quot;).
Since these transition rules for constant symbols (leaves) do not require a state, no explicitly defined initial states are needed.
A bottom-up tree automaton is run on a ground term over &quot;F&quot;, starting at all its leaves simultaneously and moving upwards, associating a run state from &quot;Q&quot; with each subterm.
The term is accepted if its root is associated to an accepting state from .

A top-down finite tree automaton over &quot;F&quot; is defined as a tuple
(&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;&quot;i&quot;, Δ),
with two differences with bottom-up tree automata. First, , the set of its initial states, replaces ; second, its transition rules are oriented conversely:
&quot;q&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) → &quot;f&quot;(&quot;q&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;1)...,&quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)), for an &quot;n&quot;-ary , and &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; variables denoting subtrees.
That is, members of Δ are here rewrite rules from nodes whose roots are states to nodes whose children&#x27;s roots are states.
A top-down automaton starts in some of its initial states at the root and moves downward along branches of the tree, associating along a run a state with each subterm inductively.
A tree is accepted if every branch can be gone through this way.

A tree automaton is called deterministic (abbreviated DFTA) if no two rules from Δ have the same left hand side; otherwise it is called nondeterministic (NFTA). Non-deterministic top-down tree automata have the same expressive power as non-deterministic bottom-up ones; the transition rules are simply reversed, and the final states become the initial states.

In contrast, deterministic top-down tree automata are less powerful than their bottom-up counterparts, because in a deterministic tree automaton no two transition rules have the same left-hand side. For tree automata, transition rules are rewrite rules; and for top-down ones, the left-hand side will be parent nodes. Consequently, a deterministic top-down tree automaton will only be able to test for tree properties that are true in all branches, because the choice of the state to write into each child branch is determined at the parent node, without knowing the child branches contents.

Infinite-tree automata extend top-down automata to infinite trees, and can be used to prove decidability of S2S, the monadic second-order theory with two successors. Finite tree automata (nondeterministic if top-down) suffice for WS2S.

== Examples ==

===Bottom-up automaton accepting boolean lists===
Employing coloring to distinguish members of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;, and using the ranked alphabet &quot;F&quot;={ ,,(..) }, with having arity 2 and all other symbols having arity 0, a bottom-up tree automaton accepting the set of all finite lists of boolean values can be defined as (&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;&quot;f&quot;, Δ) with and Δ consisting of the rules
:

In this example, the rules can be understood intuitively as assigning to each term its type in a bottom-up manner; e.g. rule (4) can be read as &quot;A term (&quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2) has type , provided &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 has type and , respectively&quot;.
An accepting example run is
:

Cf. the derivation of the same term from a regular tree grammar corresponding to the automaton, shown at Regular tree grammar#Examples.

A rejecting example run is
:
Intuitively, this corresponds to the term (,) not being well-typed.

===Top-down automaton accepting multiples of 3 in binary notation===


Using the same colorization as above, this example shows how tree automata generalize ordinary string automata.
The finite deterministic string automaton shown in the picture accepts all strings of binary digits that denote a multiple of 3.
Using the notions from Deterministic finite automaton#Formal definition, it is defined by:
* the set &quot;Q&quot; of states being { , , },
* the input alphabet being { , },
* the initial state being ,
* the set of final states being { }, and
* the transitions being as shown in column (B) of the table.

In the tree automaton setting, the input alphabet is changed such that the symbols and are both unary, and a nullary symbol, say is used for tree leaves.
For example, the binary string &quot;&quot; in the string automaton setting corresponds to the term &quot;((()))&quot; in the tree automaton setting; this way, strings can be generalized to trees, or terms.
The top-down finite tree automaton accepting the set of all terms corresponding to multiples of 3 in binary string notation is then defined by:
* the set &quot;Q&quot; of states being still { , , },
* the ranked input alphabet being { , , }, with &quot;Arity&quot;()=&quot;Arity&quot;()=1 and &quot;Arity&quot;()=0, as explained,
* the set of initial states being { }, and
* the transitions being as shown in column (C) of the table.
For example, the tree &quot;((()))&quot; is accepted by the following tree automaton run:


In contrast, the term &quot;(())&quot; leads to following non-accepting automaton run:


Since there are no other initial states than to start an automaton run with, the term &quot;(())&quot; is not accepted by the tree automaton.

For comparison purposes, the table gives in column (A) and (D) a (right) regular (string) grammar, and a regular tree grammar, respectively, each accepting the same language as its automaton counterpart.

== Properties ==

=== Recognizability ===

For a bottom-up automaton, a ground term &quot;t&quot; (that is, a tree) is accepted if there exists a reduction that starts from &quot;t&quot; and ends with &quot;q&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), where &quot;q&quot; is a final state. For a top-down automaton, a ground term &quot;t&quot; is accepted if there exists a reduction that starts from &quot;q&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and ends with &quot;t&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; is an initial state.

The tree language &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) accepted, or recognized, by a tree automaton &quot;A&quot; is the set of all ground terms accepted by &quot;A&quot;. A set of ground terms is recognizable if there exists a tree automaton that accepts it.

A linear (that is, arity-preserving) tree homomorphism preserves recognizability.

=== Completeness and reduction ===

A non-deterministic finite tree automaton is complete if there is at least one transition rule available for every possible symbol-states combination.
A state &quot;q&quot; is accessible if there exists a ground term &quot;t&quot; such that there exists a reduction from &quot;t&quot; to &quot;q&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).
An NFTA is reduced if all its states are accessible.

=== Pumping lemma ===

Every sufficiently large ground term &quot;t&quot; in a recognizable tree language &quot;L&quot; can be vertically tripartited such that arbitrary repetition (&quot;pumping&quot;) of the middle part keeps the resulting term in &quot;L&quot;.

For the language of all finite lists of boolean values from the above example, all terms beyond the height limit &quot;k&quot;=2 can be pumped, since they need to contain an occurrence of . For example,

all belong to that language.

=== Closure ===

The class of recognizable tree languages is closed under union, under complementation, and under intersection.

=== Myhill–Nerode theorem ===

A congruence on the set of all trees over a ranked alphabet &quot;F&quot; is an equivalence relation such that and ... and implies , for every .
It is of finite index if its number of equivalence-classes is finite.

For a given tree-language &quot;L&quot;, a congruence can be defined by if for each context &quot;C&quot;.

The Myhill–Nerode theorem for tree automata states that the following three statements are equivalent:

# &quot;L&quot; is a recognizable tree language
# &quot;L&quot; is the union of some equivalence classes of a congruence of finite index
# the relation is a congruence of finite index

<text>Olney is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It is located in the north central part of the county, north of Washington, D.C.

Olney was largely agricultural until the 1960s, when growth of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s suburbs led to its conversion into a mostly residential area. It has a total population of 35,820 as of the 2020 United States census.

==History==
In 1763, Richard Brooke received a patent for a tract of land located in the Province of Maryland. Originally known as Mechanicsville, the village which became Olney was established in 1800. The area was mostly farmland, but it soon began attracting artisans. Early residents Sarah Brooke and Dr. Charles Farquhar were devotees of the English poet William Cowper, and named their home after the poet&#x27;s hometown of Olney in England. The area was later named for their home, which still stands and is known as the Olney House. In the town&#x27;s center was a blacksmith, William Kelley&#x27;s wheelwright shop, Canby&#x27;s pottery factory, and a Benedict Duley&#x27;s store.

The Brooke family held the largest tracts of land in Olney, whose central village was at the intersection of the Rockville to Baltimore road, and the one which connected Washington with Westminster to the north. The Quaker community in Sandy Spring thrived just to Olney&#x27;s east. The Sandy Spring Museum is a historical museum featuring educational programs and displays. St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church was established in 1842 and survives to this day.

Although not as involved in the Civil War as areas of Maryland to the west, Olney residents still experienced the tug-of-war between loyalty to the plantation economy of the South and to the Federal government in Maryland&#x27;s midst. Both Union and Confederate forces made stops in Olney during the war. Union Generals George B. McClellan and Ambrose Burnside led soldiers through in the midst of the Maryland Campaign in 1862. During the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart marched between 10,000 and 20,000 troops north through the village and raided it of supplies, including horses and crops from surrounding farms in which they bivouacked.

Olney served as the original headquarters of the Emergency Management Institute, founded in 1951 as the Civil Defense Staff College (CDSC) to provide training for civil defense. While there, the college built &quot;Rescue Street,&quot; a training center designed to resemble atomic bomb ruins. The CDSC was soon relocated to Battle Creek, Michigan due to security concerns of a potential attack on Washington, D.C. during the Cold War.

==Geography==
Olney has a total area of , all land.

Olney&#x27;s town center sits at the intersection of state route 97 (Georgia Avenue) and route 108 (Olney-Laytonsville Road). The town, larger than any other in the neighboring areas, lies south of Brookeville, west of Sandy Spring, east-northeast of Gaithersburg, north-northeast of Rockville, and north of Aspen Hill.

==Education==
There are three Montgomery County Public School clusters that trisect Olney, with some children attending elementary and middle schools that send students on to Sherwood High School and others attending schools that send students to Magruder High School or James Hubert Blake High School. The Our Lady of Good Counsel High School building opened in January 2007, enabling the Roman Catholic high school to relocate to Olney from Wheaton, Maryland. The new building of Washington Christian Academy opened in 2008 in Olney. Brooke Grove Elementary School, a public elementary school in Olney, was awarded in 1999 the Blue Ribbon School for Excellence.

<doc id="98759" wikidata="Q751969" url="?curid=98759" title="Coset">
<text>In mathematics, specifically group theory, a subgroup of a group may be used to decompose the underlying set of into disjoint, equal-size subsets called cosets. There are &quot;left cosets&quot; and &quot;right cosets&quot;. Cosets (both left and right) have the same number of elements (cardinality) as does . Furthermore, itself is both a left coset and a right coset. The number of left cosets of in is equal to the number of right cosets of in . This common value is called the index of in and is usually denoted by .

Cosets are a basic tool in the study of groups; for example, they play a central role in Lagrange&#x27;s theorem that states that for any finite group , the number of elements of every subgroup of divides the number of elements of . Cosets of a particular type of subgroup (a normal subgroup) can be used as the elements of another group called a quotient group or factor group. Cosets also appear in other areas of mathematics such as vector spaces and error-correcting codes.

== Definition ==
Let be a subgroup of the group whose operation is written multiplicatively (juxtaposition denotes the group operation). Given an element of , the left cosets of in are the sets obtained by multiplying each element of by a fixed element of (where is the left factor). In symbols these are,

The right cosets are defined similarly, except that the element is now a right factor, that is,
As varies through the group, it would appear that many cosets (right or left) would be generated. Nevertheless, it turns out that any two left cosets (respectively right cosets) are either disjoint or are identical as sets.

If the group operation is written additively, as is often the case when the group is abelian, the notation used changes to or , respectively.

The symbol &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is sometimes used for the set of (left) cosets {&quot;gH&quot; : &quot;g&quot; an element of &quot;G&quot;} (see below for a extension to right cosets and double cosets). However, some authors (including Dummit &amp; Foote and Rotman) reserve this notation specifically for representing the quotient group formed from the cosets in the case where &quot;H&quot; is a &quot;normal&quot; subgroup of &quot;G.&quot; 

=== First example ===
Let be the dihedral group of order six. Its elements may be represented by . In this group, and . This is enough information to fill in the entire Cayley table:
Let be the subgroup . The (distinct) left cosets of are:
* , and
Since all the elements of have now appeared in one of these cosets, generating any more can not give new cosets; any new coset would have to have an element in common with one of these and therefore would be identical to one of these cosets. For instance, .

The right cosets of are:
* , and

In this example, except for , no left coset is also a right coset.

Let be the subgroup . The left cosets of are and . The right cosets of are and . In this case, every left coset of is also a right coset of .

Let be a subgroup of a group and suppose that , . The following statements are equivalent:
* 
* 

== Properties ==
The disjointness of non-identical cosets is a result of the fact that if belongs to then . For if then there must exist an such that . Thus . Moreover, since is a group, left multiplication by is a bijection, and .

Thus every element of belongs to exactly one left coset of the subgroup , and is itself a left coset (and the one that contains the identity).

Two elements being in the same left coset also provide a natural equivalence relation. Define two elements of , and , to be equivalent with respect to the subgroup if (or equivalently if belongs to ). The equivalence classes of this relation are the left cosets of . As with any set of equivalence classes, they form a partition of the underlying set. A coset representative is a representative in the equivalence class sense. A set of representatives of all the cosets is called a transversal. There are other types of equivalence relations in a group, such as conjugacy, that form different classes which do not have the properties discussed here.

Similar statements apply to right cosets.

If is an abelian group, then for every subgroup of and every element of . For general groups, given an element and a subgroup of a group , the right coset of with respect to is also the left coset of the conjugate subgroup with respect to , that is, .

=== Normal subgroups ===
A subgroup of a group is a normal subgroup of if and only if for all elements of the corresponding left and right cosets are equal, that is, . This is the case for the subgroup in the first example above. Furthermore, the cosets of in form a group called the quotient group or factor group .

If is not normal in , then its left cosets are different from its right cosets. That is, there is an in such that no element satisfies . This means that the partition of into the left cosets of is a different partition than the partition of into right cosets of . This is illustrated by the subgroup in the first example above. (&quot;Some&quot; cosets may coincide. For example, if is in the center of , then .)

On the other hand, if the subgroup is normal the set of all cosets forms a group called the quotient group with the operation defined by . Since every right coset is a left coset, there is no need to distinguish &quot;left cosets&quot; from &quot;right cosets&quot;.

=== Index of a subgroup ===

Every left or right coset of has the same number of elements (or cardinality in the case of an infinite ) as itself. Furthermore, the number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets and is known as the index of in &quot;G&quot;, written as . Lagrange&#x27;s theorem allows us to compute the index in the case where and are finite:
formula_1
This equation can be generalized to the case where the groups are infinite.

== More examples ==

=== Integers ===
Let be the additive group of the integers, and the subgroup . Then the cosets of in are the three sets , , and , where . These three sets partition the set , so there are no other right cosets of . Due to the commutivity of addition and . That is, every left coset of is also a right coset, so is a normal subgroup. (The same argument shows that every subgroup of an Abelian group is normal.)

This example may be generalized. Again let be the additive group of the integers, , and now let the subgroup , where is a positive integer. Then the cosets of in are the sets , , ..., , where . There are no more than cosets, because . The coset is the congruence class of modulo . The subgroup is normal in , and so, can be used to form the quotient group the group of integers mod.

=== Vectors ===
Another example of a coset comes from the theory of vector spaces. The elements (vectors) of a vector space form an abelian group under vector addition. The subspaces of the vector space are subgroups of this group. For a vector space , a subspace , and a fixed vector in , the sets
formula_2
are called affine subspaces, and are cosets (both left and right, since the group is abelian). In terms of 3-dimensional geometric vectors, these affine subspaces are all the &quot;lines&quot; or &quot;planes&quot; parallel to the subspace, which is a line or plane going through the origin. For example, consider the plane . If is a line through the origin , then is a subgroup of the abelian group . If is in , then the coset is a line parallel to and passing through .

=== Matrices ===
Let be the multiplicative group of matrices,
formula_3
and the subgroup of ,
formula_4
For a fixed element of consider the left coset
formula_5
That is, the left cosets consist of all the matrices in having the same upper-left entry. This subgroup is normal in , but the subgroup
formula_6
is not normal in .

== As orbits of a group action ==
A subgroup of a group can be used to define an action of on in two natural ways. A &quot;right action&quot;, given by or a &quot;left action&quot;, given by . The orbit of under the right action is the left coset , while the orbit under the left action is the right coset .

== History ==
The concept of a coset dates back to Galois&#x27;s work of 1830–31. He introduced a notation but did not provide a name for the concept. The term &quot;co-set&quot; apparently appears for the first time in 1910 in a paper by G. A. Miller in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics&quot; (vol. 41, p. 382). Various other terms have been used including the German &quot;Nebengruppen&quot; (Weber) and &quot;conjugate group&quot; (Burnside). (Note that Miller abbreviated his self-citation to the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Mathematics&quot;; this does not refer to the journal of the same name, which did not start publication until 1930.)

Galois was concerned with deciding when a given polynomial equation was solvable by radicals. A tool that he developed was in noting that a subgroup of a group of permutations induced two decompositions of (what we now call left and right cosets). If these decompositions coincided, that is, if the left cosets are the same as the right cosets, then there was a way to reduce the problem to one of working over instead of . Camille Jordan in his commentaries on Galois&#x27;s work in 1865 and 1869 elaborated on these ideas and defined normal subgroups as we have above, although he did not use this term.

Calling the coset the &quot;left coset&quot; of with respect to , while most common today, has not been universally true in the past. For instance, would call a &quot;right coset&quot;, emphasizing the subgroup being on the right.

== An application from coding theory ==

A binary linear code is an -dimensional subspace of an -dimensional vector space over the binary field . As is an additive abelian group, is a subgroup of this group. Codes can be used to correct errors that can occur in transmission. When a &quot;codeword&quot; (element of ) is transmitted some of its bits may be altered in the process and the task of the receiver is to determine the most likely codeword that the corrupted &quot;received word&quot; could have started out as. This procedure is called &quot;decoding&quot; and if only a few errors are made in transmission it can be done effectively with only a very few mistakes. One method used for decoding uses an arrangement of the elements of (a received word could be any element of ) into a standard array. A standard array is a coset decomposition of put into tabular form in a certain way. Namely, the top row of the array consists of the elements of , written in any order, except that the zero vector should be written first. Then, an element of with a minimal number of ones that does not already appear in the top row is selected and the coset of containing this element is written as the second row (namely, the row is formed by taking the sum of this element with each element of directly above it). This element is called a coset leader and there may be some choice in selecting it. Now the process is repeated, a new vector with a minimal number of ones that does not already appear is selected as a new coset leader and the coset of containing it is the next row. The process ends when all the vectors of have been sorted into the cosets.

An example of a standard array for the 2-dimensional code in the 5-dimensional space (with 32 vectors) is as follows:

The decoding procedure is to find the received word in the table and then add to it the coset leader of the row it is in. Since in binary arithmetic adding is the same operation as subtracting, this always results in an element of . In the event that the transmission errors occurred in precisely the non-zero positions of the coset leader the result will be the right codeword. In this example, if a single error occurs, the method will always correct it, since all possible coset leaders with a single one appear in the array.

Syndrome decoding can be used to improve the efficiency of this method. It is a method of computing the correct coset (row) that a received word will be in. For an -dimensional code in an -dimensional binary vector space, a parity check matrix is an matrix having the property that if and only if is in . The vector is called the &quot;syndrome&quot; of , and by linearity, every vector in the same coset will have the same syndrome. To decode, the search is now reduced to finding the coset leader that has the same syndrome as the received word.

== Double cosets ==

Given two subgroups, and (which need not be distinct) of a group , the double cosets of and in are the sets of the form . These are the left cosets of and right cosets of when and respectively.

Two double cosets and are either disjoint or identical. The set of all double cosets for fixed and form a partition of .

A double coset contains the complete right cosets of (in ) of the form , with an element of and the complete left cosets of (in ) of the form , with in .

=== Notation ===
Let be a group with subgroups and . Several authors working with these sets have developed a specialized notation for their work, where
* denotes the set of left cosets of in .
* denotes the set of right cosets of in .
* denotes the set of double cosets of and in , sometimes referred to as &quot;double coset space&quot;.
* denotes the double coset space of the subgroup in .

== More applications ==
* Cosets of in are used in the construction of Vitali sets, a type of non-measurable set.
* Cosets are central in the definition of the transfer.
* Cosets are important in computational group theory. For example, Thistlethwaite&#x27;s algorithm for solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube relies heavily on cosets.
* In geometry, a Clifford–Klein form is a double coset space , where is a reductive Lie group, is a closed subgroup, and is a discrete subgroup (of ) that acts properly discontinuously on the homogeneous space .

<text>The Spanning Tree Protocol(STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup links providing fault tolerance if an active link fails.

As the name suggests, STP creates a spanning tree that characterizes the relationship of nodes within a network of connected layer-2 bridges, and disables those links that are not part of the spanning tree, leaving a single active path between any two network nodes. STP is based on an algorithm that was invented by Radia Perlman while she was working for Digital Equipment Corporation.

In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as 802.1w. RSTP provides significantly faster recovery in response to network changes or failures, introducing new convergence behaviors and bridge port roles to do this. RSTP was designed to be backwards-compatible with standard STP.

STP was originally standardized as IEEE 802.1D but the functionality of spanning tree (802.1D), rapid spanning tree (802.1w), and multiple spanning tree (802.1s) has since been incorporated into IEEE 802.1Q-2014.

While STP is still in use today, in most modern networks its primary use is as a loop-protection mechanism rather than a fault tolerance mechanism. Link aggregation protocols such as LACP will bond two or more links to provide fault tolerance while simultaneously increasing overall link capacity.

==Protocol operation==
The need for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) arose because switches in local area networks (LANs) are often interconnected using redundant links to improve resilience should one connection fail. However, this connection configuration creates a switching loop resulting in broadcast radiations and MAC table instability. If redundant links are used to connect switches, then switching loops need to be avoided.

To avoid the problems associated with redundant links in a switched LAN, STP is implemented on switches to monitor the network topology. Every link between switches, and in particular redundant links, are catalogued. The spanning-tree algorithm then blocks forwarding on redundant links by setting up one preferred link between switches in the LAN. This preferred link is used for all Ethernet frames unless it fails, in which case a non-preferred redundant link is enabled. When implemented in a network, STP designates one layer-2 switch as &quot;root bridge&quot;. All switches then select their best connection towards the root bridge for forwarding and block other redundant links. All switches constantly communicate with their neighbors in the LAN using (BPDUs).

Provided there is more than one link between two switches, the STP root bridge calculates the cost of each path based on bandwidth. STP will select the path with the lowest cost, that is the highest bandwidth, as the preferred link. STP will enable this preferred link as the only path to be used for Ethernet frames between the two switches, and disable all other possible links by designating the switch ports that connect the preferred path as &quot;root port&quot;.

After STP enabled switches in a LAN have elected the root bridge, all non-root bridges assign one of their ports as root port. This is either the port that connects the switch to the root bridge, or if there are several paths, the port with the preferred path as calculated by the root bridge. Because not all switches are directly connected to the root bridge they communicate amongst each other using STP BPDUs. Each switch adds the cost of its own path to the cost received from the neighboring switches to determine the total cost of a given path to the root bridge. Once the cost of all possible paths to the root bridge have been added up, each switch assigns a port as root port which connects to the path with the lowest cost, or highest bandwidth, that will eventually lead to the root bridge.

=== Path cost ===
The STP path cost default was originally calculated by the formula . When faster speeds became available, the default values were adjusted as otherwise speeds above would have been indistinguishable by STP. Its successor RSTP uses a similar formula with a larger numerator: . These formulas lead to the sample values in the table.

=== Port states ===
All switch ports in the LAN where STP is enabled are categorized.
; Blocking: A port that would cause a switching loop if it were active. To prevent the use of looped paths, no user data is sent or received over a blocking port. BPDU data is still received in blocking state. A blocked port may go into forwarding mode if the other links in use fail and the spanning tree algorithm determines the port may transition to the forwarding state.
; Listening: The switch processes BPDUs and awaits possible new information that would cause it to return to the blocking state. It does not populate the MAC table and it does not forward frames.
; Learning: While the port does not yet forward frames, it does learn source addresses from frames received and adds them to the MAC table.
; Forwarding: A port in normal operation receiving and forwarding frames. The port monitors incoming BPDUs that would indicate it should return to the blocking state to prevent a loop.
; Disabled: A network administrator has manually disabled the switch port.

When a device is first attached to a switch port, it will not immediately start to forward data. It will instead go through a number of states while it processes BPDUs and determines the topology of the network. The port attached to a host such as a computer, printer or server always goes into the forwarding state, albeit after a delay of about 30 seconds while it goes through the listening and learning states. The time spent in the listening and learning states is determined by a value known as the forward delay (default 15 seconds and set by the root bridge). If another switch is connected, the port may remain in blocking mode if it is determined that it would cause a loop in the network. Topology change notification (TCN) BPDUs are used to inform other switches of port changes. TCNs are injected into the network by a non-root switch and propagated to the root. Upon receipt of the TCN, the root switch will set the topology change flag in its normal BPDUs. This flag is propagated to all other switches and instructs them to rapidly age out their forwarding table entries.

== Configuration ==
Before configuring STP, the network topology should be carefully planned. Basic configuration requires that STP be enabled on all switches in the LAN and the same version of STP chosen on each. The administrator may determine which switch will be the root bridge and configure the switches appropriately. If the root bridge goes down, the protocol will automatically assign a new root bridge based on bridge ID. If all switches have the same bridge ID, such as the default ID, and the root bridge goes down, a tie situation arises and the protocol will assign one switch as root bridge based on the switch MAC addresses. Once the switches have been assigned a bridge ID and the protocol has chosen the root bridge switch, the best path to the root bridge is calculated based on port cost, path cost and port priority. Ultimately STP calculates the path cost on the basis of the bandwidth of a link, however links between switches may have the same bandwidth. Administrators can influence the protocol&#x27;s choice of the preferred path by configuring the port cost; the lower the port cost the more likely it is that the protocol will choose the connected link as root port for the preferred path. The selection of how other switches in the topology choose their root port, or the least cost path to the root bridge, can be influenced by the port priority. The highest priority will mean the path will ultimately be less preferred. If all ports of a switch have the same priority, the port with the lowest number is chosen to forward frames.

===Root bridge and the bridge ID===
The &quot;root bridge&quot; of the spanning tree is the bridge with the smallest (lowest) bridge ID. Each bridge has a configurable priority number and a MAC address; the bridge ID is the concatenation of the bridge priority and the MAC address. For example, the ID of a bridge with priority 32,768 and MAC is . The bridge priority default is 32,768 and can be configured only in multiples of 4096. When comparing two bridge IDs, the priority portions are compared first and the MAC addresses are compared only if the priorities are equal. The switch with the lowest priority of all the switches will be the root; if there is a tie, then the switch with the lowest priority and lowest MAC address will be the root. For example, if switches &quot;A&quot; (MAC = ) and &quot;B&quot; (MAC = ) both have a priority of 32,768 then switch &quot;A&quot; will be selected as the root bridge. If the network administrators would like switch &quot;B&quot; to become the root bridge, they must set its priority to be less than 32,768.

=== Path to the root bridge ===
The sequence of events to determine the best received BPDU (which is the best path to the root) is:

# Lowest root bridge ID (BID)Determines the root bridge.
# Lowest cost to the root bridgeFavors the upstream switch with the least cost to root
# Lowest sender bridge IDServes as a tiebreaker if multiple upstream switches have equal cost to root
# Lowest sender port IDServes as a tiebreaker if a switch has multiple (non-EtherChannel) links to a single upstream switch, where:
#*Bridge ID = priority (4 bits) + locally assigned system ID extension (12 bits) + ID [MAC address] (48 bits); the default bridge priority is 32,768, and
#*Port ID = priority (4 bits) + ID (Interface number) (12 bits); the default port priority is 128.

=== Tiebreakers ===
;Root ports
:When multiple paths from a bridge are least-cost paths, the chosen path uses the neighbor bridge with the lower bridge ID. The root port is thus the one connecting to the bridge with the lowest bridge ID. For example, in the figures, if switch 4 were connected to network segment d instead of segment f, there would be two paths of length 2 to the root, one path going through bridge 24 and the other through bridge 92. Because there are two least-cost paths, the lower bridge ID (24) would be used as the tiebreaker in choosing which path to use.
;Paths
:When more than one bridge on a segment leads to a least-cost path to the root, the bridge with the lower bridge ID is used to forward messages to the root. The port attaching that bridge to the network segment is the &quot;designated port&quot; for the segment. In the figures, there are two least-cost paths from network segment d to the root, one going through bridge 24 and the other through bridge 92. The lower bridge ID is 24, so the tiebreaker dictates that the designated port is the port through which network segment d is connected to bridge 24. If bridge IDs were equal, then the bridge with the lowest MAC address would have the designated port. In either case, the loser sets the port as being blocked.
;Designated ports
:When the root bridge has more than one port on a single network segment, the bridge ID is effectively tied, as are all root path costs (all equal zero). The port on that network segment with the lowest port ID becomes the designated port. It is put into forwarding mode while all other ports on the root bridge on that same network segment become non-designated ports and are put into blocking mode. Not all bridge manufacturers follow this rule, instead making all root bridge ports designated ports, and putting them all in forwarding mode.
;Final tiebreaker
:In some cases, there may still be a tie, as when the root bridge has multiple active ports on the same network segment (see above) with equally low root path costs and bridge IDs, or, in other cases, multiple bridges are connected by multiple cables and multiple ports. In each case, a single bridge may have multiple candidates for its root port. In these cases, candidates for the root port have already received BPDUs offering equally-low (i.e. the &quot;best&quot;) root path costs and equally-low (i.e. the &quot;best&quot;) bridge IDs, and the final tiebreaker goes to the port that received the lowest (i.e. the &quot;best&quot;) port priority ID, or port ID.

==Bridge protocol data units==
The above rules describe one way of determining what spanning tree will be computed by the algorithm, but the rules as written require knowledge of the entire network. The bridges have to determine the root bridge and compute the port roles (root, designated, or blocked) with only the information that they have. To ensure that each bridge has enough information, the bridges use special data frames called bridge protocol data units (BPDUs) to exchange information about the spanning tree protocol, bridge IDs, and root path costs.



;
;
;
BPDUs are exchanged regularly (every 2 seconds by default) and enable switches to keep track of network changes and to start and stop forwarding at ports as required. To prevent the delay when connecting hosts to a switch and during some topology changes, Rapid STP was developed, which allows a switch port to rapidly transition into the forwarding state during these situations.

===BPDU types===
There are two types of BPDUs in the original STP specification (802.1D) (the Rapid Spanning Tree (RSTP) extension uses a specific RSTP BPDU).

IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1aq BPDUs have the following format:

Topology change notification (TCN) BPDU, used to announce changes in the network topology, such as port up or port down.

==Spanning Tree Protocol standards==
The first spanning tree protocol was invented in 1985 at the Digital Equipment Corporation by Radia Perlman. In 1990, the IEEE published the first standard for the protocol as 802.1D, based on the algorithm designed by Perlman. Subsequent versions were published in 1998 and 2004, incorporating various extensions. The original Perlman-inspired Spanning Tree Protocol, called DEC STP, is not a standard and differs from the IEEE version in message format as well as timer settings. Some bridges implement both the IEEE and the DEC versions of the Spanning Tree Protocol, but their interworking can create issues for the network administrator.

Different implementations of a standard are not guaranteed to interoperate, due for example to differences in default timer settings. The IEEE encourages vendors to provide a Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement, declaring which capabilities and options have been implemented, to help users determine whether different implementations will interoperate correctly.

===Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol===

In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as IEEE 802.1w. RSTP was then incorporated into IEEE 802.1D-2004 making the original STP standard obsolete. RSTP was designed to be backward-compatible with standard STP.

RSTP provides significantly faster spanning tree convergence after a topology change, introducing new convergence behaviors and bridge port roles to accomplish this. While STP can take 30 to 50 seconds to respond to a topology change, RSTP is typically able to respond to changes within 3 × &quot;hello times&quot; (default: 3 2 seconds) or within a few milliseconds of a physical link failure. The hello time is an important and configurable time interval that is used by RSTP for several purposes; its default value is 2 seconds.

====Rapid Spanning Tree operation====

RSTP adds new bridge port roles in order to speed convergence following a link failure:
*RootA forwarding port that is the best port from non-root bridge to root bridge
*DesignatedA forwarding port for every network segment
*AlternateAn alternate path to the root bridge. This path is different from using the root port
*BackupA backup/redundant path to a segment where another bridge port already connects
*DisabledNot strictly part of STP, a network administrator can manually disable a port

The number of switch port states a port can be in has been reduced to three instead of STP&#x27;s original five:
*DiscardingNo user data is sent over the port
*LearningThe port is not forwarding frames yet, but is populating its MAC address table
*ForwardingThe port is fully operational

RSTP operational details:
* Detection of root switch failure is done in 3 hello times, which is 6 seconds if the default hello times have not been changed.
* Ports may be configured as edge ports if they are attached to a LAN that has no other bridges attached (depending on vendor, &quot;admin-edge&quot; or &quot;portfast&quot; mode). These edge ports transition directly to the forwarding state, avoiding problems with hosts expecting an upcoming link to work right away, e.g. with DHCP. RSTP still continues to monitor the port for BPDUs in case a bridge is connected. RSTP can also be configured to automatically detect edge ports. As soon as the bridge detects a BPDU coming to an edge port, the port becomes a non-edge port.
* RSTP calls the connection between two or more switches as a &quot;link-type&quot; connection. A port that operates in full-duplex mode is assumed to be point-to-point link, whereas a half-duplex port (through a hub) is considered a shared port by default. This automatic link type setting can be overridden by explicit configuration. RSTP improves convergence on point-to-point links by reducing the Max-Age time to 3 times Hello interval, removing the STP listening state, and exchanging a handshake between two switches to quickly transition the port to forwarding state. RSTP does not do anything differently from STP on shared links.
* Unlike in STP, RSTP will respond to BPDUs sent from the direction of the root bridge. An RSTP bridge will &quot;propose&quot; its spanning tree information to its designated ports. If another RSTP bridge receives this information and determines this is the superior root information, it sets all its other ports to discarding. The bridge may send an &quot;agreement&quot; to the first bridge confirming its superior spanning tree information. The first bridge, upon receiving this agreement, knows it can rapidly transition that port to the forwarding state bypassing the listening/learning state transition. This essentially creates a cascading effect away from the root bridge where each designated bridge proposes to its neighbors to determine if it can make a rapid transition. This is one of the major elements that allows RSTP to achieve faster convergence times than STP.
* As discussed in the port role details above, RSTP maintains backup details regarding the discarding status of ports. This avoids timeouts if the current forwarding ports were to fail or BPDUs were not received on the root port in a certain interval.
* RSTP will revert to legacy STP on an interface if a legacy version of an STP BPDU is detected on that port.

== Standards for VLANs ==
STP and RSTP do not segregate switch ports by VLAN. However, in Ethernet switched environments where multiple VLANs exist, it is often desirable to create multiple spanning trees so that traffic on different VLANs uses different links.

=== Proprietary standards ===
Before the IEEE published a Spanning Tree Protocol standard for VLANs, a number of vendors who sold VLAN-capable switches developed their own Spanning Tree Protocol versions that were VLAN capable. Cisco developed, implemented and published the Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST) proprietary protocol using its own proprietary Inter-Switch Link (ISL) for VLAN encapsulation, and PVST+ which uses 802.1Q VLAN encapsulation. Both standards implement a separate spanning tree for every VLAN. Cisco switches now commonly implement PVST+ and can only implement Spanning Trees for VLANs if the other switches in the LAN implement the same VLAN STP protocol. HP provides PVST and PVST+ compatibility in some of its network switches. Some devices from Force10 Networks, Alcatel-Lucent, Extreme Networks, Avaya, Brocade Communications Systems and BLADE Network Technologies support PVST+. Extreme Networks does so with two limitations: Lack of support on ports where the VLAN is untagged/native, and also on the VLAN with ID 1. PVST+ can tunnel across an MSTP Region.

The switch vendor Juniper Networks in turn developed and implemented its VLAN Spanning Tree Protocol (VSTP) to provide compatibility with Cisco&#x27;s PVST, so that the switches from both vendors can be included in one LAN. The VSTP protocol is only supported by the EX and MX Series from Juniper Networks. There are two restrictions to the compatibility of VSTP:
#VSTP supports only 253 different spanning-tree topologies. If there are more than 253 VLANs, it is recommended to configure RSTP in addition to VSTP, and VLANs beyond 253 will be handled by RSTP.
#MVRP does not support VSTP. If this protocol is in use, VLAN membership for trunk interfaces must be statically configured.

By default, VSTP uses the RSTP protocol as its core spanning-tree protocol, but usage of STP can be forced if the network includes old bridges. More information about configuring VSTP on Juniper Networks switches was published in the official documentation.

Cisco also published a proprietary version of Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol. It creates a spanning tree for each VLAN, just like PVST. Cisco refers to this as Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (RPVST).

=== Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol ===
The Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), originally defined in IEEE 802.1s-2002 and later merged into IEEE 802.1Q-2005, defines an extension to RSTP to further develop the usefulness of VLANs.

In the standard, a spanning tree that maps one or more VLANs is called a &quot;multiple spanning tree&quot; (MST). Under MSTP, a spanning tree can be defined for individual VLANs or for groups of VLANs. Furthermore, the administrator can define alternate paths within a spanning tree. Switches are first assigned to an MST region, then VLANs are mapped against or assigned to this MST. A &quot;common spanning tree&quot; (CST) is an MST to which several VLANs are mapped, this group of VLANs is called &quot;MST instance&quot; (MSTI). CSTs are backward compatible with the STP and RSTP standard. A MST that has only one VLAN assigned to it is an &quot;internal spanning tree&quot; (IST).

Unlike some proprietary per-VLAN spanning tree implementations, MSTP includes all of its spanning tree information in a single BPDU format. Not only does this reduce the number of BPDUs required to communicate spanning tree information for each VLAN, but it also ensures backward compatibility with RSTP and, in effect, classic STP too. MSTP does this by encoding an additional region of information after the standard RSTP BPDU as well as a number of MSTI messages (from 0 to 64 instances, although in practice many bridges support fewer). Each of these MSTI configuration messages conveys the spanning tree information for each instance. Each instance can be assigned a number of configured VLANs and frames assigned to these VLANs operate in this spanning tree instance whenever they are inside the MST region. In order to avoid conveying their entire VLAN to spanning tree mapping in each BPDU, bridges encode an MD5 digest of their VLAN to instance table in the MSTP BPDU. This digest is then used by other MSTP bridges, along with other administratively configured values, to determine if the neighboring bridge is in the same MST region as itself.

MSTP is fully compatible with RSTP bridges in that an MSTP BPDU can be interpreted by an RSTP bridge as an RSTP BPDU. This not only allows compatibility with RSTP bridges without configuration changes but also causes any RSTP bridges outside of an MSTP region to see the region as a single RSTP bridge regardless of the number of MSTP bridges inside the region itself. In order to further facilitate this view of an MSTP region as a single RSTP bridge, the MSTP protocol uses a variable known as remaining hops as a time to live counter instead of the message age timer used by RSTP. The message age time is only incremented once when spanning-tree information enters an MST region, and therefore RSTP bridges will see a region as only one &quot;hop&quot; in the spanning tree. Ports at the edge of an MSTP region connected to either an RSTP or STP bridge or an endpoint are known as boundary ports. As in RSTP, these ports can be configured as edge ports to facilitate rapid changes to the forwarding state when connected to endpoints.

==Shortest path bridging==
IEEE 802.1aq, also known as Shortest Path Bridging (SPB), allows redundant links between switches to be active through multiple equal cost paths, and provides much larger layer-2 topologies, faster convergence, and improves the use of the mesh topologies through increased bandwidth between all devices by allowing traffic to load share across all paths on a mesh network. SPB consolidates multiple existing functionalities, including Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), Link aggregation, and Multiple MAC Registration Protocol (MMRP) into a one link state protocol.

===System ID Extension===
The bridge ID (BID) is a field inside a BPDU packet. It is eight bytes in length. The first two bytes are the bridge priority, an unsigned integer of 0–65,535. The last six bytes are a MAC address supplied by the bridge. Prior to IEEE 802.1D-2004, the first two bytes gave a 16-bit bridge priority. Since IEEE 802.1D-2004, the first four bits are a configurable priority, and the last twelve bits carry the bridge system ID extension. In the case of MST, the bridge system ID extension carries the MSTP instance number. Some vendors set the bridge system ID extension to carry a VLAN ID allowing a different spanning tree per VLAN, such as Cisco&#x27;s PVST.

== Disadvantages and current practice ==
Spanning tree is an older protocol with a longer convergence time. Improper use or implementation can contribute to network disruptions. Blocking links is a crude approach to high availability and preventing loops. Modern networks can make use of all connected links by use of protocols that inhibit, control or suppress the natural behavior of logical or physical topology loops.

Newer, more robust protocols include the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol, also created by Perlman, and Shortest Path Bridging from the IEEE.

Configuring connections between network equipment as layer-3 IP links and relying on IP routing for resiliency and to prevent loops is a popular alternative.

Switch virtualization techniques like Cisco Virtual Switching System and Virtual PortChannel and HP Intelligent Resilient Framework combine multiple switches into a single logical entity. Such a multi-chassis link aggregation group works like a normal port trunk, only distributed through multiple switches. Conversely, partitioning technologies compartmentalize a single physical chassis into multiple logical entities.

On the edge of the network, loop-detection is configured to prevent accidental loops by users.

<text>In music, serialism is a method of composition using series of pitches, rhythms, dynamics, timbres or other musical elements. Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique, though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition&#x27;s melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations. Other types of serialism also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called &quot;parameters&quot;), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre.

The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the visual arts, design, and architecture, and the musical concept has also been adapted in literature.

Integral serialism or total serialism is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post-World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are general serialism and multiple serialism.

Composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono, Milton Babbitt, Elisabeth Lutyens, Henri Pousseur, Charles Wuorinen and Jean Barraqué used serial techniques of one sort or another in most of their music. Other composers such as Tadeusz Baird, Béla Bartók, Luciano Berio, Bruno Maderna, Franco Donatoni, Benjamin Britten, John Cage, Aaron Copland, Ernst Krenek, György Ligeti, Olivier Messiaen, Arvo Pärt, Walter Piston, Ned Rorem, Alfred Schnittke, Ruth Crawford Seeger, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Igor Stravinsky used serialism only in some of their compositions or only in some sections of pieces, as did some jazz composers, such as Bill Evans, Yusef Lateef, Bill Smith, and even rock musicians like Frank Zappa.

==Basic definitions==
Serialism is a method, &quot;highly specialized technique&quot;, or &quot;way&quot; of composition. It may also be considered &quot;a philosophy of life (&quot;Weltanschauung&quot;), a way of relating the human mind to the world and creating a completeness when dealing with a subject&quot;.

Serialism is not by itself a system of composition or a style. Neither is pitch serialism necessarily incompatible with tonality, though it is most often used as a means of composing atonal music.

&quot;Serial music&quot; is a problematic term because it is used differently in different languages and especially because, shortly after its coinage in French, it underwent essential alterations during its transmission to German. The term&#x27;s use in connection with music was first introduced in French by René Leibowitz in 1947, and immediately afterward by Humphrey Searle in English, as an alternative translation of the German (twelve-tone technique) or (row music); it was independently introduced by Stockhausen and Herbert Eimert into German in 1955 as , with a different meaning, but also translated as &quot;serial music&quot;.

===Twelve-tone serialism===
Serialism of the first type is most specifically defined as a structural principle according to which a recurring series of ordered elements (normally a set—or row—of pitches or pitch classes) is used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity. &quot;Serial&quot; is often broadly used to describe all music written in what Schoenberg called &quot;The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another&quot;, or dodecaphony, and methods that evolved from his methods. It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music in which at least one element other than pitch is treated as a row or series. Such methods are often called &quot;post-Webernian serialism&quot;. Other terms used to make the distinction are &quot;twelve-note serialism&quot; for the former and &quot;integral serialism&quot; for the latter.

A row may be assembled pre-compositionally (perhaps to embody particular intervallic or symmetrical properties), or derived from a spontaneously invented thematic or motivic idea. The row&#x27;s structure does not in itself define the structure of a composition, which requires development of a comprehensive strategy. The choice of strategy often depends on the relationships contained in a row class, and rows may be constructed with an eye to producing the relationships needed to form desired strategies.

The basic set may have additional restrictions, such as the requirement that it use each interval only once.

===Non-twelve-tone serialism===
&quot;The series is not an order of succession, but indeed a hierarchy—which may be independent of this order of succession&quot;.

Rules of analysis derived from twelve-tone theory do not apply to serialism of the second type: &quot;in particular the ideas, one, that the series is an intervallic sequence, and two, that the rules are consistent&quot;. For example, Stockhausen&#x27;s early serial works, such as &quot;Kreuzspiel&quot; and &quot;Formel&quot;, &quot;advance in unit sections within which a preordained set of pitches is repeatedly reconfigured ... The composer&#x27;s model for the distributive serial process corresponds to a development of the Zwölftonspiel of Josef Matthias Hauer&quot;. Goeyvaerts&#x27;s &quot;Nummer 4&quot; provides a classic illustration of the distributive function of seriality: 4 times an equal number of elements of equal duration within an equal global time is distributed in the most equable way, unequally with regard to one another, over the temporal space: from the greatest possible coïncidence to the greatest possible dispersion. This provides an exemplary demonstration of that logical principle of seriality: &quot;every situation must occur once and only once&quot;.
Henri Pousseur, after initially working with twelve-tone technique in works like &quot;Sept Versets&quot; (1950) and &quot;Trois Chants sacrés&quot; (1951),evolved away from this bond in &quot;Symphonies pour quinze Solistes&quot; [1954–55] and in the &quot;Quintette&quot; [&quot;à la mémoire d’Anton Webern&quot;, 1955], and from around the time of &quot;Impromptu&quot; [1955] encounters whole new dimensions of application and new functions.
The twelve-tone series loses its imperative function as a prohibiting, regulating, and patterning authority; its working-out is abandoned through its own constant-frequent presence: all 66 intervallic relations among the 12 pitches being virtually present. Prohibited intervals, like the octave, and prohibited successional relations, such as premature note repetitions, frequently occur, although obscured in the dense contexture. The number twelve no longer plays any governing, defining rôle; the pitch constellations no longer hold to the limitation determined by their formation. The dodecaphonic series loses its significance as a concrete model of shape (or a well-defined collection of concrete shapes) is played out. And the chromatic total remains active only, and provisionally, as a general reference.
In the 1960s Pousseur took this a step further, applying a consistent set of predefined transformations to preexisting music. One example is the large orchestral work &quot;Couleurs croisées&quot; (&quot;Crossed Colours&quot;, 1967), which performs these transformations on the protest song &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, creating a succession of different situations that are sometimes chromatic and dissonant and sometimes diatonic and consonant. In his opera &quot;Votre Faust&quot; (&quot;Your Faust&quot;, 1960–68) Pousseur used many quotations, themselves arranged into a &quot;scale&quot; for serial treatment. This &quot;generalised&quot; serialism (in the strongest possible sense) aims not to exclude any musical phenomena, no matter how heterogeneous, in order &quot;to control the effects of tonal determinism, dialectize its causal functions, and overcome any academic prohibitions, especially the fixing of an anti-grammar meant to replace some previous one&quot;.

At about the same time, Stockhausen began using serial methods to integrate a variety of musical sources from recorded examples of folk and traditional music from around the world in his electronic composition &quot;Telemusik&quot; (1966), and from national anthems in &quot;Hymnen&quot; (1966–67). He extended this serial &quot;polyphony of styles&quot; in a series of &quot;process-plan&quot; works in the late 1960s, as well as later in portions of &quot;Licht&quot;, the cycle of seven operas he composed between 1977 and 2003.

==History of serial music==

===Before World War II===

In the late 19th and early 20th century, composers began to struggle against the ordered system of chords and intervals known as &quot;functional tonality&quot;. Composers such as Debussy and Strauss found ways to stretch the limits of the tonal system to accommodate their ideas. After a brief period of free atonality, Schoenberg and others began exploring tone rows, in which an ordering of the 12 pitches of the equal-tempered chromatic scale is used as the source material of a composition. This ordered set, often called a row, allowed for new forms of expression and (unlike free atonality) the expansion of underlying structural organizing principles without recourse to common practice harmony.

Twelve-tone serialism first appeared in the 1920s, with antecedents predating that decade (instances of 12-note passages occur in Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; and in Bach.) Schoenberg was the composer most decisively involved in devising and demonstrating the fundamentals of twelve-tone serialism, though it is clear it is not the work of just one musician. In Schoenberg&#x27;s own words, his goal of was to show constraint in composition. Consequently, some reviewers have jumped to the conclusion that serialism acted as a predetermined method of composing to avoid the subjectivity and ego of a composer in favor of calculated measure and proportion. In the 1930s, serial composers such as Schoenberg, Krenek, Wolpe, and Eisler left Europe for the U.S. to escape World War II. This sparked a change in American music as well as the works of the European composers now residing in the U.S.

===After World War II===

Along with John Cage&#x27;s indeterminate music (music composed with the use of chance operations) and Werner Meyer-Eppler&#x27;s aleatoricism, serialism was enormously influential in postwar music. Theorists such as Milton Babbitt and George Perle codified serial systems, leading to a mode of composition called &quot;total serialism&quot;, in which every aspect of a piece, not just pitch, is serially constructed. Perle&#x27;s 1962 text &quot;Serial Composition and Atonality&quot; became a standard work on the origins of serial composition in the music of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern.

The serialization of rhythm, dynamics, and other elements of music was partly fostered by the work of Olivier Messiaen and his analysis students, including Karel Goeyvaerts and Boulez, in postwar Paris. Messiaen first used a chromatic rhythm scale in his &quot;Vingt Regards sur l&#x27;enfant-Jésus&quot; (1944), but he did not employ a rhythmic series until 1946–48, in the seventh movement, &quot;Turangalîla II&quot;, of his &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot;. The first examples of such integral serialism are Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;Three Compositions for Piano&quot; (1947), &quot;Composition for Four Instruments&quot; (1948), and &quot;Composition for Twelve Instruments&quot; (1948). He worked independently of the Europeans.

Several of the composers associated with Darmstadt, notably Stockhausen, Goeyvaerts, and Pousseur, developed a form of serialism that initially rejected the recurring rows characteristic of twelve-tone technique in order to eradicate any lingering traces of thematicism. Instead of a recurring, referential row, &quot;each musical component is subjected to control by a series of numerical proportions&quot;. In Europe, some serial and non-serial music of the early 1950s emphasized the determination of all parameters for each note independently, often resulting in widely spaced, isolated &quot;points&quot; of sound, an effect called first in German &quot;punktuelle Musik&quot; (&quot;pointist&quot; or &quot;punctual music&quot;), then in French &quot;musique ponctuelle&quot;, but quickly confused with &quot;pointillistic&quot; (German &quot;pointillistische&quot;, French &quot;pointilliste&quot;), the term associated with the densely packed dots in Seurat&#x27;s paintings, even though the concept was unrelated.

Pieces were structured by closed sets of proportions, a method closely related to certain works from the de Stijl and Bauhaus movements in design and architecture some writers called &quot;serial art&quot;, specifically the paintings of Piet Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg, Bart van Leck, Georg van Tongerloo, Richard Paul Lohse, and Burgoyne Diller, who had sought to &quot;avoid repetition and symmetry on all structural levels and working with a limited number of elements&quot;.

Stockhausen described the final synthesis in this manner:So serial thinking is something that&#x27;s come into our consciousness and will be there forever: it&#x27;s relativity and nothing else. It just says: Use all the components of any given number of elements, don&#x27;t leave out individual elements, use them all with equal importance and try to find an equidistant scale so that certain steps are no larger than others. It&#x27;s a spiritual and democratic attitude toward the world. The stars are organized in a serial way. Whenever you look at a certain star sign you find a limited number of elements with different intervals. If we more thoroughly studied the distances and proportions of the stars we&#x27;d probably find certain relationships of multiples based on some logarithmic scale or whatever the scale may be.

Stravinsky&#x27;s adoption of twelve-tone serial techniques shows the level of influence serialism had after the Second World War. Previously Stravinsky had used series of notes without rhythmic or harmonic implications. Because many of the basic techniques of serial composition have analogs in traditional counterpoint, uses of inversion, retrograde, and retrograde inversion from before the war do not necessarily indicate Stravinsky was adopting Schoenbergian techniques. But after meeting Robert Craft and other younger composers, Stravinsky began to study Schoenberg&#x27;s music, as well as that of Webern and later composers, and to adapt their techniques in his work, using, for example, serial techniques applied to fewer than twelve notes. During the 1950s he used procedures related to Messiaen, Webern and Berg. While it is inaccurate to call them all &quot;serial&quot; in the strict sense, all his major works of the period have clear serialist elements.

During this period, the concept of serialism influenced not only new compositions but also scholarly analysis of the classical masters. Adding to their professional tools of sonata form and tonality, scholars began to analyze previous works in the light of serial techniques; for example, they found the use of row technique in previous composers going back to Mozart and Beethoven. In particular, the orchestral outburst that introduces the development section halfway through the last movement of Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 40 is a tone row that Mozart punctuates in a very modern and violent way that Michael Steinberg called &quot;rude octaves and frozen silences&quot;.

Ruth Crawford Seeger extended serial control to parameters other than pitch and to formal planning as early as 1930–33 in a fashion that goes beyond Webern but was less thoroughgoing than the later practices of Babbitt and European postwar composers. Charles Ives&#x27;s 1906 song &quot;The Cage&quot; begins with piano chords presented in incrementally decreasing durations, an early example of an overtly arithmetic duration series independent of meter (like Nono&#x27;s six-element row shown above), and in that sense a precursor to Messiaen&#x27;s style of integral serialism. The idea of organizing pitch and rhythm according to similar or related principles is also suggested by both Henry Cowell&#x27;s &quot;New Musical Resources&quot; (1930) and the work of Joseph Schillinger.

==Reactions to serialism==

Some music theorists have criticized serialism on the basis that its compositional strategies are often incompatible with the way the human mind processes a piece of music. Nicolas Ruwet (1959) was one of the first to criticise serialism by a comparison with linguistic structures, citing theoretical claims by Boulez and Pousseur, taking as specific examples bars from Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Klavierstücke I &amp; II&quot;, and calling for a general reexamination of Webern&#x27;s music. Ruwet specifically names three works as exempt from his criticism: Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zeitmaße&quot; and &quot;Gruppen&quot;, and Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Le marteau sans maître&quot;.

In response, Pousseur questioned Ruwet&#x27;s equivalence between phonemes and notes. He also suggested that, if analysis of &quot;Le marteau sans maître&quot; and &quot;Zeitmaße&quot;, &quot;performed with sufficient insight&quot;, were to be made from the point of view of wave theory—taking into account the dynamic interaction of the different component phenomena, which creates &quot;waves&quot; that interact in a sort of frequency modulation—the analysis &quot;would accurately reflect the realities of perception&quot;. This was because these composers had long since acknowledged the lack of differentiation found in punctual music and, becoming increasingly aware of the laws of perception and complying better with them, &quot;paved the way to a more effective kind of musical communication, without in the least abandoning the emancipation that they had been allowed to achieve by this &#x27;zero state&#x27; that was punctual music&quot;. One way this was achieved was by developing the concept of &quot;groups&quot;, which allows structural relationships to be defined not only between individual notes but also at higher levels, up to the overall form of a piece. This is &quot;a structural method par excellence&quot;, and a sufficiently simple conception that it remains easily perceptible. Pousseur also points out that serial composers were the first to recognize and attempt to move beyond the lack of differentiation within certain pointillist works. Pousseur later followed up on his own suggestion by developing his idea of &quot;wave&quot; analysis and applying it to Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zeitmaße&quot; in two essays.

Later writers have continued both lines of reasoning. Fred Lerdahl, for example, in his essay &quot;Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems&quot;, argues that serialism&#x27;s perceptual opacity ensures its aesthetic inferiority. Lerdahl has in turn been criticized for excluding &quot;the possibility of other, non-hierarchical methods of achieving musical coherence,&quot; and for concentrating on the audibility of tone rows, and the portion of his essay focusing on Boulez&#x27;s &quot;multiplication&quot; technique (exemplified in three movements of &quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot;) has been challenged on perceptual grounds by Stephen Heinemann and Ulrich Mosch. Ruwet&#x27;s critique has also been criticised for making &quot;the fatal mistake of equating visual presentation (a score) with auditive presentation (the music as heard)&quot;.

In all these reactions discussed above, the &quot;information extracted&quot;, &quot;perceptual opacity&quot;, &quot;auditive presentation&quot; (and constraints thereof) pertain to what defines serialism, namely use of a series. And since Schoenberg remarked, &quot;in the later part of a work, when the set [series] had already become familiar to the ear&quot;, it has been assumed that serial composers expect their series to be aurally perceived. This principle even became the premise of empirical investigation in the guise of &quot;probe-tone&quot; experiments testing listeners&#x27; familiarity with a row after exposure to its various forms (as would occur in a 12-tone work). In other words the supposition in critiques of serialism has been that, if a composition is so intricately structured by and around a series, that series should ultimately be clearly perceived or that a listener ought to become aware of its presence or importance. Babbitt denied this:

Seemingly in accord with Babbitt&#x27;s statement, but ranging over such issues as perception, aesthetic value, and the &quot;poietic fallacy&quot;, Walter Horn offers a more extensive explanation of the serialism (and atonality) controversy.

Within the community of modern music, exactly what constituted serialism was also a matter of debate. The conventional English usage is that the word &quot;serial&quot; applies to all twelve-tone music, which is a subset of serial music, and it is this usage that is generally intended in reference works. Nevertheless, a large body of music exists that is called &quot;serial&quot; but does not employ note-rows at all, let alone twelve-tone technique, e.g., Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Klavierstücke I–IV&quot; (which use permuted sets), his &quot;Stimmung&quot; (with pitches from the overtone series, which is also used as the model for the rhythms), and Pousseur&#x27;s &quot;Scambi&quot; (where the permuted sounds are made exclusively from filtered white noise).

When serialism is not limited to twelve-tone techniques, a contributing problem is that the word &quot;serial&quot; is seldom if ever defined. In many published analyses of individual pieces the term is used while actual meaning is skated around.

==Theory of twelve-tone serial music==

Due to Babbitt&#x27;s work, in the mid-20th century serialist thought became rooted in set theory and began to use a quasi-mathematical vocabulary for the manipulation of the basic sets. Musical set theory is often used to analyze and compose serial music, and is also sometimes used in tonal and nonserial atonal analysis.

The basis for serial composition is Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique, where the 12 notes of the chromatic scale are organized into a row. This &quot;basic&quot; row is then used to create permutations, that is, rows derived from the basic set by reordering its elements. The row may be used to produce a set of intervals, or a composer may derive the row from a particular succession of intervals. A row that uses all of the intervals in their ascending form once is an all-interval row. In addition to permutations, the basic row may have some set of notes derived from it, which is used to create a new row. These are &quot;derived sets&quot;.

Because there are tonal chord progressions that use all twelve notes, it is possible to create pitch rows with very strong tonal implications, and even to write tonal music using twelve-tone technique. Most tone rows contain subsets that can imply a pitch center; a composer can create music centered on one or more of the row&#x27;s constituent pitches by emphasizing or avoiding these subsets, respectively, as well as through other, more complex compositional devices.

To serialize other elements of music, a system quantifying an identifiable element must be created or defined (this is called &quot;parametrization&quot;, after the term in mathematics). For example, if duration is serialized, a set of durations must be specified; if tone colour (timbre) is serialized, a set of separate tone colours must be identified; and so on.

The selected set or sets, their permutations and derived sets form the composer&#x27;s basic material.

Composition using twelve-tone serial methods focuses on each appearance of the collection of twelve chromatic notes, called an aggregate. (Sets of more or fewer pitches, or of elements other than pitch, may be treated analogously.) One principle operative in some serial compositions is that no element of the aggregate should be reused in the same contrapuntal strand (statement of a series) until all the other members have been used, and each member must appear only in its place in the series. Yet, since most serial compositions have multiple (at least two, sometimes as many as a few dozen) series statements occurring concurrently, interwoven with each other in time, and feature repetitions of some of their pitches, this principle as stated is more a referential abstraction than a description of the concrete reality of a musical work that is termed &quot;serial&quot;.

A series may be divided into subsets, and the members of the aggregate not part of a subset are said to be its &quot;complement&quot;. A subset is &quot;self-complementing&quot; if it contains half of the set and its complement is also a permutation of the original subset. This is most commonly seen with &quot;hexachords&quot;, six-note segments of a tone row. A hexachord that is self-complementing for a particular permutation is called &quot;prime combinatorial&quot;. A hexachord that is self-complementing for all the canonic operations—inversion, retrograde, and retrograde inversion—is called &quot;all-combinatorial&quot;.

<text>A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a Markov model in which the observations are dependent on a latent (or &quot;hidden&quot;) Markov process (referred to as formula_1). An HMM requires that there be an observable process formula_2 whose outcomes depend on the outcomes of formula_1 in a known way. Since formula_1 cannot be observed directly, the goal is to learn about state of formula_1 by observing formula_2. By definition of being a Markov model, an HMM has an additional requirement that the outcome of formula_2 at time formula_8 must be &quot;influenced&quot; exclusively by the outcome of formula_1 at formula_8 and that the outcomes of formula_1 and formula_2 at formula_13 must be conditionally independent of formula_2 at formula_15 given formula_1 at time formula_8. Estimation of the parameters in an HMM can be performed using maximum likelihood estimation. For linear chain HMMs, the Baum–Welch algorithm can be used to estimate parameters.

Hidden Markov models are known for their applications to thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, physics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory, pattern recognition—such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics.

== Definition ==
Let formula_18 and formula_19 be discrete-time stochastic processes and formula_20. The pair formula_21 is a &quot;hidden Markov model&quot; if

* formula_18 is a Markov process whose behavior is not directly observable (&quot;hidden&quot;);
* formula_23,

:for every formula_20, formula_25, and every Borel set formula_26.

Let formula_27 and formula_28 be continuous-time stochastic processes. The pair formula_29 is a &quot;hidden Markov model&quot; if
*formula_27 is a Markov process whose behavior is not directly observable (&quot;hidden&quot;);
*formula_31,

:for every formula_32, every Borel set formula_26, and every family of Borel sets formula_34.

=== Terminology ===
The states of the process formula_18 (resp. formula_36 are called &quot;hidden states&quot;, and formula_37 (resp. formula_38 is called &quot;emission probability&quot; or &quot;output probability&quot;.

== Examples ==
=== Drawing balls from hidden urns ===
In its discrete form, a hidden Markov process can be visualized as a generalization of the urn problem with replacement (where each item from the urn is returned to the original urn before the next step). Consider this example: in a room that is not visible to an observer there is a genie. The room contains urns X1, X2, X3, ... each of which contains a known mix of balls, with each ball having a unique label y1, y2, y3, ... . The genie chooses an urn in that room and randomly draws a ball from that urn. It then puts the ball onto a conveyor belt, where the observer can observe the sequence of the balls but not the sequence of urns from which they were drawn. The genie has some procedure to choose urns; the choice of the urn for the &quot;n&quot;-th ball depends only upon a random number and the choice of the urn for the ball. The choice of urn does not directly depend on the urns chosen before this single previous urn; therefore, this is called a Markov process. It can be described by the upper part of Figure 1.

The Markov process cannot be observed, only the sequence of labeled balls, thus this arrangement is called a &quot;hidden Markov process&quot;. This is illustrated by the lower part of the diagram shown in Figure 1, where one can see that balls y1, y2, y3, y4 can be drawn at each state. Even if the observer knows the composition of the urns and has just observed a sequence of three balls, &quot;e.g.&quot; y1, y2 and y3 on the conveyor belt, the observer still cannot be &quot;sure&quot; which urn (&quot;i.e.&quot;, at which state) the genie has drawn the third ball from. However, the observer can work out other information, such as the likelihood that the third ball came from each of the urns.

=== Weather guessing game ===
Consider two friends, Alice and Bob, who live far apart from each other and who talk together daily over the telephone about what they did that day. Bob is only interested in three activities: walking in the park, shopping, and cleaning his apartment. The choice of what to do is determined exclusively by the weather on a given day. Alice has no definite information about the weather, but she knows general trends. Based on what Bob tells her he did each day, Alice tries to guess what the weather must have been like.

Alice believes that the weather operates as a discrete Markov chain. There are two states, &quot;Rainy&quot; and &quot;Sunny&quot;, but she cannot observe them directly, that is, they are &quot;hidden&quot; from her. On each day, there is a certain chance that Bob will perform one of the following activities, depending on the weather: &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;shop&quot;, or &quot;clean&quot;. Since Bob tells Alice about his activities, those are the &quot;observations&quot;. The entire system is that of a hidden Markov model (HMM).

Alice knows the general weather trends in the area, and what Bob likes to do on average. In other words, the parameters of the HMM are known. They can be represented as follows in Python:

states = (&quot;Rainy&quot;, &quot;Sunny&quot;)

observations = (&quot;walk&quot;, &quot;shop&quot;, &quot;clean&quot;)

start_probability = {&quot;Rainy&quot;: 0.6, &quot;Sunny&quot;: 0.4}

transition_probability = {
 &quot;Rainy&quot;: {&quot;Rainy&quot;: 0.7, &quot;Sunny&quot;: 0.3},
 &quot;Sunny&quot;: {&quot;Rainy&quot;: 0.4, &quot;Sunny&quot;: 0.6},

emission_probability = {
 &quot;Rainy&quot;: {&quot;walk&quot;: 0.1, &quot;shop&quot;: 0.4, &quot;clean&quot;: 0.5},
 &quot;Sunny&quot;: {&quot;walk&quot;: 0.6, &quot;shop&quot;: 0.3, &quot;clean&quot;: 0.1},

In this piece of code, codice_1 represents Alice&#x27;s belief about which state the HMM is in when Bob first calls her (all she knows is that it tends to be rainy on average). The particular probability distribution used here is not the equilibrium one, which is (given the transition probabilities) approximately codice_2. The codice_3 represents the change of the weather in the underlying Markov chain. In this example, there is only a 30% chance that tomorrow will be sunny if today is rainy. The codice_4 represents how likely Bob is to perform a certain activity on each day. If it is rainy, there is a 50% chance that he is cleaning his apartment; if it is sunny, there is a 60% chance that he is outside for a walk.

&quot;A similar example is further elaborated in the Viterbi algorithm page.&quot;

== Structural architecture ==
The diagram below shows the general architecture of an instantiated HMM. Each oval shape represents a random variable that can adopt any of a number of values. The random variable &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the hidden state at time (with the model from the above diagram, . The random variable &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the observation at time (with . The arrows in the diagram (often called a trellis diagram) denote conditional dependencies.

From the diagram, it is clear that the conditional probability distribution of the hidden variable &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) at time , given the values of the hidden variable at all times, depends &quot;only&quot; on the value of the hidden variable ; the values at time and before have no influence. This is called the Markov property. Similarly, the value of the observed variable &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) depends on only the value of the hidden variable &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) (both at time ).

In the standard type of hidden Markov model considered here, the state space of the hidden variables is discrete, while the observations themselves can either be discrete (typically generated from a categorical distribution) or continuous (typically from a Gaussian distribution). The parameters of a hidden Markov model are of two types, &quot;transition probabilities&quot; and &quot;emission probabilities&quot; (also known as &quot;output probabilities&quot;). The transition probabilities control the way the hidden state at time is chosen given the hidden state at time formula_39.

The hidden state space is assumed to consist of one of possible values, modelled as a categorical distribution. (See the section below on extensions for other possibilities.) This means that for each of the possible states that a hidden variable at time can be in, there is a transition probability from this state to each of the possible states of the hidden variable at time formula_40, for a total of formula_41 transition probabilities. The set of transition probabilities for transitions from any given state must sum to 1. Thus, the formula_42 matrix of transition probabilities is a Markov matrix. Because any transition probability can be determined once the others are known, there are a total of formula_43 transition parameters.

In addition, for each of the possible states, there is a set of emission probabilities governing the distribution of the observed variable at a particular time given the state of the hidden variable at that time. The size of this set depends on the nature of the observed variable. For example, if the observed variable is discrete with possible values, governed by a categorical distribution, there will be formula_44 separate parameters, for a total of formula_45 emission parameters over all hidden states. On the other hand, if the observed variable is an -dimensional vector distributed according to an arbitrary multivariate Gaussian distribution, there will be parameters controlling the means and formula_46 parameters controlling the covariance matrix, for a total of formula_47 emission parameters. (In such a case, unless the value of is small, it may be more practical to restrict the nature of the covariances between individual elements of the observation vector, e.g. by assuming that the elements are independent of each other, or less restrictively, are independent of all but a fixed number of adjacent elements.)

== Inference ==
Several inference problems are associated with hidden Markov models, as outlined below.

=== Probability of an observed sequence ===
The task is to compute in a best way, given the parameters of the model, the probability of a particular output sequence. This requires summation over all possible state sequences:

The probability of observing a sequence
: formula_48
of length &quot;L&quot; is given by
:formula_49
where the sum runs over all possible hidden-node sequences
: formula_50

Applying the principle of dynamic programming, this problem, too, can be handled efficiently using the forward algorithm.

=== Probability of the latent variables ===
A number of related tasks ask about the probability of one or more of the latent variables, given the model&#x27;s parameters and a sequence of observations formula_51.

==== Filtering ====
The task is to compute, given the model&#x27;s parameters and a sequence of observations, the distribution over hidden states of the last latent variable at the end of the sequence, i.e. to compute formula_52. This task is used when the sequence of latent variables is thought of as the underlying states that a process moves through at a sequence of points in time, with corresponding observations at each point. Then, it is natural to ask about the state of the process at the end.

This problem can be handled efficiently using the forward algorithm. An example is when the algorithm is applied to a Hidden Markov Network to determine formula_53.

==== Smoothing ====
This is similar to filtering but asks about the distribution of a latent variable somewhere in the middle of a sequence, i.e. to compute formula_54 for some formula_55. From the perspective described above, this can be thought of as the probability distribution over hidden states for a point in time &quot;k&quot; in the past, relative to time &quot;t&quot;.

The forward-backward algorithm is a good method for computing the smoothed values for all hidden state variables.

==== Most likely explanation ====
The task, unlike the previous two, asks about the joint probability of the &quot;entire&quot; sequence of hidden states that generated a particular sequence of observations (see illustration on the right). This task is generally applicable when HMM&#x27;s are applied to different sorts of problems from those for which the tasks of filtering and smoothing are applicable. An example is part-of-speech tagging, where the hidden states represent the underlying parts of speech corresponding to an observed sequence of words. In this case, what is of interest is the entire sequence of parts of speech, rather than simply the part of speech for a single word, as filtering or smoothing would compute.

This task requires finding a maximum over all possible state sequences, and can be solved efficiently by the Viterbi algorithm.

=== Statistical significance ===
For some of the above problems, it may also be interesting to ask about statistical significance. What is the probability that a sequence drawn from some null distribution will have an HMM probability (in the case of the forward algorithm) or a maximum state sequence probability (in the case of the Viterbi algorithm) at least as large as that of a particular output sequence? When an HMM is used to evaluate the relevance of a hypothesis for a particular output sequence, the statistical significance indicates the false positive rate associated with failing to reject the hypothesis for the output sequence.

== Learning ==

The parameter learning task in HMMs is to find, given an output sequence or a set of such sequences, the best set of state transition and emission probabilities. The task is usually to derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of the HMM given the set of output sequences. No tractable algorithm is known for solving this problem exactly, but a local maximum likelihood can be derived efficiently using the Baum–Welch algorithm or the Baldi–Chauvin algorithm. The Baum–Welch algorithm is a special case of the expectation-maximization algorithm. 

If the HMMs are used for time series prediction, more sophisticated Bayesian inference methods, like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are proven to be favorable over finding a single maximum likelihood model both in terms of accuracy and stability. Since MCMC imposes significant computational burden, in cases where computational scalability is also of interest, one may alternatively resort to variational approximations to Bayesian inference, e.g. Indeed, approximate variational inference offers computational efficiency comparable to expectation-maximization, while yielding an accuracy profile only slightly inferior to exact MCMC-type Bayesian inference.

== Applications ==
HMMs can be applied in many fields where the goal is to recover a data sequence that is not immediately observable (but other data that depend on the sequence are). Applications include:

* Sequence motif discovery (DNA and proteins)
* DNA hybridization kinetics
*Chromatin state discovery
*Transportation forecasting
*Solar irradiance variability

== History ==
Hidden Markov models were described in a series of statistical papers by Leonard E. Baum and other authors in the second half of the 1960s. One of the first applications of HMMs was speech recognition, starting in the mid-1970s. From the linguistics point of view, hidden Markov models are equivalent to stochastic regular grammar.

In the second half of the 1980s, HMMs began to be applied to the analysis of biological sequences, in particular DNA. Since then, they have become ubiquitous in the field of bioinformatics.

== Extensions ==
=== General state spaces ===
In the hidden Markov models considered above, the state space of the hidden variables is discrete, while the observations themselves can either be discrete (typically generated from a categorical distribution) or continuous (typically from a Gaussian distribution). Hidden Markov models can also be generalized to allow continuous state spaces. Examples of such models are those where the Markov process over hidden variables is a linear dynamical system, with a linear relationship among related variables and where all hidden and observed variables follow a Gaussian distribution. In simple cases, such as the linear dynamical system just mentioned, exact inference is tractable (in this case, using the Kalman filter); however, in general, exact inference in HMMs with continuous latent variables is infeasible, and approximate methods must be used, such as the extended Kalman filter or the particle filter.

Nowadays, inference in hidden Markov models is performed in nonparametric settings, where the dependency structure enables identifiability of the model and the learnability limits are still under exploration.

=== Bayesian modeling of the transitions probabilities ===
Hidden Markov models are generative models, in which the joint distribution of observations and hidden states, or equivalently both the prior distribution of hidden states (the &quot;transition probabilities&quot;) and conditional distribution of observations given states (the &quot;emission probabilities&quot;), is modeled. The above algorithms implicitly assume a uniform prior distribution over the transition probabilities. However, it is also possible to create hidden Markov models with other types of prior distributions. An obvious candidate, given the categorical distribution of the transition probabilities, is the Dirichlet distribution, which is the conjugate prior distribution of the categorical distribution. Typically, a symmetric Dirichlet distribution is chosen, reflecting ignorance about which states are inherently more likely than others. The single parameter of this distribution (termed the &quot;concentration parameter&quot;) controls the relative density or sparseness of the resulting transition matrix. A choice of 1 yields a uniform distribution. Values greater than 1 produce a dense matrix, in which the transition probabilities between pairs of states are likely to be nearly equal. Values less than 1 result in a sparse matrix in which, for each given source state, only a small number of destination states have non-negligible transition probabilities. It is also possible to use a two-level prior Dirichlet distribution, in which one Dirichlet distribution (the upper distribution) governs the parameters of another Dirichlet distribution (the lower distribution), which in turn governs the transition probabilities. The upper distribution governs the overall distribution of states, determining how likely each state is to occur; its concentration parameter determines the density or sparseness of states. Such a two-level prior distribution, where both concentration parameters are set to produce sparse distributions, might be useful for example in unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, where some parts of speech occur much more commonly than others; learning algorithms that assume a uniform prior distribution generally perform poorly on this task. The parameters of models of this sort, with non-uniform prior distributions, can be learned using Gibbs sampling or extended versions of the expectation-maximization algorithm.

An extension of the previously described hidden Markov models with Dirichlet priors uses a Dirichlet process in place of a Dirichlet distribution. This type of model allows for an unknown and potentially infinite number of states. It is common to use a two-level Dirichlet process, similar to the previously described model with two levels of Dirichlet distributions. Such a model is called a &quot;hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model&quot;, or &quot;HDP-HMM&quot; for short. It was originally described under the name &quot;Infinite Hidden Markov Model&quot; and was further formalized in &quot;Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes&quot;.

=== Discriminative approach ===
A different type of extension uses a discriminative model in place of the generative model of standard HMMs. This type of model directly models the conditional distribution of the hidden states given the observations, rather than modeling the joint distribution. An example of this model is the so-called &quot;maximum entropy Markov model&quot; (MEMM), which models the conditional distribution of the states using logistic regression (also known as a &quot;maximum entropy model&quot;). The advantage of this type of model is that arbitrary features (i.e. functions) of the observations can be modeled, allowing domain-specific knowledge of the problem at hand to be injected into the model. Models of this sort are not limited to modeling direct dependencies between a hidden state and its associated observation; rather, features of nearby observations, of combinations of the associated observation and nearby observations, or in fact of arbitrary observations at any distance from a given hidden state can be included in the process used to determine the value of a hidden state. Furthermore, there is no need for these features to be statistically independent of each other, as would be the case if such features were used in a generative model. Finally, arbitrary features over pairs of adjacent hidden states can be used rather than simple transition probabilities. The disadvantages of such models are: (1) The types of prior distributions that can be placed on hidden states are severely limited; (2) It is not possible to predict the probability of seeing an arbitrary observation. This second limitation is often not an issue in practice, since many common usages of HMM&#x27;s do not require such predictive probabilities.

A variant of the previously described discriminative model is the linear-chain conditional random field. This uses an undirected graphical model (aka Markov random field) rather than the directed graphical models of MEMM&#x27;s and similar models. The advantage of this type of model is that it does not suffer from the so-called &quot;label bias&quot; problem of MEMM&#x27;s, and thus may make more accurate predictions. The disadvantage is that training can be slower than for MEMM&#x27;s.

=== Other extensions ===
Yet another variant is the &quot;factorial hidden Markov model&quot;, which allows for a single observation to be conditioned on the corresponding hidden variables of a set of formula_56 independent Markov chains, rather than a single Markov chain. It is equivalent to a single HMM, with formula_57 states (assuming there are formula_58 states for each chain), and therefore, learning in such a model is difficult: for a sequence of length formula_59, a straightforward Viterbi algorithm has complexity formula_60. To find an exact solution, a junction tree algorithm could be used, but it results in an formula_61 complexity. In practice, approximate techniques, such as variational approaches, could be used.

All of the above models can be extended to allow for more distant dependencies among hidden states, e.g. allowing for a given state to be dependent on the previous two or three states rather than a single previous state; i.e. the transition probabilities are extended to encompass sets of three or four adjacent states (or in general formula_56 adjacent states). The disadvantage of such models is that dynamic-programming algorithms for training them have an formula_63 running time, for formula_56 adjacent states and formula_59 total observations (i.e. a length-formula_59 Markov chain). This extension has been widely used in bioinformatics, in the modeling of DNA sequences.

Another recent extension is the &quot;triplet Markov model&quot;, in which an auxiliary underlying process is added to model some data specificities. Many variants of this model have been proposed. One should also mention the interesting link that has been established between the &quot;theory of evidence&quot; and the &quot;triplet Markov models&quot; and which allows to fuse data in Markovian context and to model nonstationary data. Alternative multi-stream data fusion strategies have also been proposed in recent literature, e.g.,

Finally, a different rationale towards addressing the problem of modeling nonstationary data by means of hidden Markov models was suggested in 2012. It consists in employing a small recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a reservoir network, to capture the evolution of the temporal dynamics in the observed data. This information, encoded in the form of a high-dimensional vector, is used as a conditioning variable of the HMM state transition probabilities. Under such a setup, eventually is obtained a nonstationary HMM, the transition probabilities of which evolve over time in a manner that is inferred from the data, in contrast to some unrealistic ad-hoc model of temporal evolution.

In 2023, two innovative algorithms were introduced for the Hidden Markov Model. These algorithms enable the computation of the posterior distribution of the HMM without the necessity of explicitly modeling the joint distribution, utilizing only the conditional distributions. Unlike traditional methods such as the Forward-Backward and Viterbi algorithms, which require knowledge of the joint law of the HMM and can be computationally intensive to learn, the Discriminative Forward-Backward and Discriminative Viterbi algorithms circumvent the need for the observation&#x27;s law. This breakthrough allows the HMM to be applied as a discriminative model, offering a more efficient and versatile approach to leveraging Hidden Markov Models in various applications.

The model suitable in the context of longitudinal data is named latent Markov model. The basic version of this model has been extended to include individual covariates, random effects and to model more complex data structures such as multilevel data. A complete overview of the latent Markov models, with special attention to the model assumptions and to their practical use is provided in

== Measure theory ==
Given a Markov transition matrix and an invariant distribution on the states, a probability measure can be imposed on the set of subshifts. For example, consider the Markov chain given on the left on the states formula_67, with invariant distribution formula_68. By ignoring the distinction between formula_69, this space of subshifts is projected on formula_67 into another space of subshifts on formula_71, and this projection also projects the probability measure down to a probability measure on the subshifts on formula_71.

The curious thing is that the probability measure on the subshifts on formula_71 is not created by a Markov chain on formula_71, not even multiple orders. Intuitively, this is because if one observes a long sequence of formula_75, then one would become increasingly sure that the formula_76, meaning that the observable part of the system can be affected by something infinitely in the past.

Conversely, there exists a space of subshifts on 6 symbols, projected to subshifts on 2 symbols, such that any Markov measure on the smaller subshift has a preimage measure that is not Markov of any order (example 2.6).

<text>The Samariá Gorge ( or just &quot;Φάραγγας&quot;) is a
National Park of Greece since 1962 on the island of Crete – a major tourist attraction of the island – and a World&#x27;s Biosphere Reserve.

The gorge is in southwest Crete in the regional unit of Chania. It was created by a small river running between the White Mountains (Lefká Óri) and Mt. Volakias. There are a number of other gorges in the White Mountains. While some say that the gorge is 18 km long, this distance refers to the distance between the settlement of Omalos on the northern side of the plateau and the village of Agia Roumeli. In fact, the gorge is 16 km long, starting at an altitude of 1,250 m at the northern entrance, and ending at the shores of the Libyan Sea in Agia Roumeli. The walk through Samaria National Park is 13 km long, but one has to walk another two kilometers to Agia Roumeli from the park exit, making the hike 15 km long. The most famous part of the gorge is the stretch known as the Gates (or, albeit incorrectly, as &quot;Iron Gates&quot;), where the sides of the gorge close in to a width of only four meters and soar up to a height of almost .
The gorge became a national park in 1962, particularly as a refuge for the rare kri-kri (Cretan goat), which is largely restricted to the park and an island just off the shore of Agia Marina. There are several other endemic species in the gorge and surrounding area, as well as many other species of flowers and birds.

The village of Samariá lies just inside the gorge. It was finally abandoned by the last remaining inhabitants in 1962 to make way for the park. The village and the gorge take their names from the village&#x27;s ancient church, Óssia María.

Visitors to Crete can complete the walk down the gorge from the Omalos plateau to Agia Roumeli on the Libyan Sea, at which point tourists sail to the nearby village of Sougia or Hora Sfakion, where they could spend a night there, or they could catch a coach back to Chania. The walk takes five to seven hours and can be strenuous, especially at the peak of summer.

Local tourist operators provide organized tours to the Gorge. These include bus transportation from one&#x27;s hotel to the entrance (near Omalos village), and a bus connection that will be waiting for hikers after they disembark the ferry in Sougia or Sfakia (Chora Sfakion). If you are on your own, you can make a one-day round trip from Chania (see below) or from Sougia or Paleochora. Note that the morning buses from Sougia and Paleochora do not operate on Sunday. The ferries leave Agia Roumeli to Chora Sfakion (eastbound) and to Sougia/Paleochora (westbound) at 17:30.

There also exists a way from Agia Roumeli to the Gates and back.

==Information provided by the Chania Forest Protection Service==
* Visits to the National park are allowed from May 1 to October 31.
* Park visiting hours are 07:00 to 15:00 daily. From 15:00 to sunset, visitors are allowed to walk a distance of only two kilometers within the park, either from Xyloskalo or from Agia Roumeli.
* Within the park it is strictly prohibited to camp, stay overnight, light fires, or swim in the streams of the gorge.

<doc id="98774" wikidata="Q492584" url="?curid=98774" title="St. Canute's Cathedral">
<text>St. Canute&#x27;s Cathedral (), also known as Odense Cathedral, is named after the Danish king Canute the Saint (), otherwise Canute IV. It is a fine example of Brick Gothic architecture. The church&#x27;s most visited section is the crypt where the remains of Canute and his brother Benedict are on display.

== History ==
St. Canute&#x27;s Church in one form or another has stood on Abbey Hill in Odense () for over 900 years.

Odense was established as the seat of the Bishop of Odense (Othinia) before 988 under the supervision of the Bishop of Schleswig, itself a suffragan of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen. The diocese included the southern Baltic islands of Denmark. The earliest bishops&#x27; names have not been recorded. Odense passed to the jurisdiction of Roskilde in 1072 for a short period of time before falling to the Archdiocese of Lund.

The earliest known church on the present location was a travertine church which was reported under construction by Aelnoth of Canterbury, a Benedictine monk at the nearby St. Alban&#x27;s Priory in 1095. The foundations of the travertine church can still be seen in the crypt of the present building. The church was built in Romanesque style with semi-circular arches supporting a flat timber ceiling. The travertine church was built specifically to house the earthly remains of King Canute, who was murdered in the church of St. Alban&#x27;s Priory in 1086.

==King Canute IV of Denmark==
Canute IV of Denmark was one of the sons of King Sven Estridsen. He participated in King Sweyn’s raid of England in 1069. In 1075 he accompanied the Danish fleet on its last great raid of England. When King Sweyn died in 1076, Canute&#x27;s brother Harald Hen was elected king of Denmark and ruled until his own death in 1080, at which time Canute succeeded him on the throne of Denmark. Canute ruled Denmark from 1080 to 1086.

Canute reigned at a difficult time in Danish history. The idea of a strengthened monarchy did not sit well with the powerful feudal landowners, but it was just what Canute had in mind. After the death of his older brother, the national assembly (&quot;Ting&quot;) met on Zealand to proclaim Canute king of Denmark. Once the assembly had shouted their approval, Canute stood up and spoke to those assembled, both peasant and nobles: &quot;You called my brother Harald the Whet-stone, but you will learn that I will be hard as granite!&quot; (&quot;kampesten&quot;). Soon after, he ordered the people of Halland to supply him with horses and wagons to transport himself and his household throughout the kingdom. The assembly met to discuss the king&#x27;s request. The people decided that the request was not lawful according to the ancient customs and laws they all knew. Canute was enraged by what he heard. &quot;It is your right to hold fast to your rights and laws and bear only the burdens the law allows, but you must also accept that I am free to do with mine what I will, and I forbid you to let your swine graze in Halland&#x27;s Great Forest which belongs to me!&quot; After hasty consultations the Hallanders supplied the required equipment. Canute did the same in Scania (southern Sweden). At the assembly he required men and supplies to build the new Lund Cathedral. When the assembly baulked, Canute swore he would forbid them to fish in the Øresund. Likewise they too acceded to the king&#x27;s request.

Canute was a devout Christian and believed that a strong central church in Denmark would give him more power. He was instrumental in improving the nationwide system of bishops by using his own local officials (&quot;fogeder&quot;) to collect tithes, a new tax, which were used to build the churches, hospitals and monasteries which were just beginning to be introduced into Denmark. Many people were Christian in name, but the old ways were only half-forgotten, and suspicions about foreigners ran high. Peasants were hard-pressed to put food on the table and the forced tithes infuriated peasants, merchants, and nobles alike.

Canute brought about the wrath of some of his chiefs when he hanged Jarl Egil Ragnarsen, his hand-picked governor of Bornholm, and most of his household for piracy. Many nobles took to the seas on occasion looking for a quick way to bolster income. The execution of a high-ranking chief caused more than one chief to reconsider his support for such a troublesome monarch.

Canute&#x27;s headaches came to a head in 1085-86, when he decided to invade England and try to take the throne from William I who was old and by some reports failing. As a close relative of Canute the Great, Canute&#x27;s claim was easily as valid as that of William of Normandy&#x27;s. With the co-operation of Robert I, Count of Flanders, his father-in-law, Canute ordered an armada of 1,000 Danish ships and 60 Norwegian ships to assemble at Struer in the Limfjord, northern Jutland, in the summer of 1085. As had been the tradition since the first Viking raid on England, local chiefs gathered ships, supplies, sailors, and warriors for a share of the profits, loot, slaves, and treasure taken during the raid. Canute in the meantime travelled from assembly to assembly in southern Jutland ordering his people to pay tithes, a tenth of all their produce for the church. At the same time he tried to institute a poll tax (&quot;nefgjald&quot;) to raise money from the peasants. The tithes and new tax were not well received, and when his brother, Olaf, protested, Canute had him arrested and exiled to Flanders in chains, believing that Olaf was responsible for the growing unrest. It took so long to pacify the south that Canute was unable to come north for weeks. In the meantime, the Danes at Struer were hungry, bored, and very unhappy with the king. Finally they agreed that they would sail home. They told themselves that the weather would turn bad before they could complete a successful raid, and that such a late start would spell disaster. The order to assemble had not been made at an assembly, and was therefore unlawful in the popular view. To the Norwegians they said, &quot;You can stay here in this place of starvation, if you will. We are going home.&quot;

When Canute arrived at Struer and found the fleet disbanded, he was furious. He thanked the Norwegians for their patience and sent them home. &quot;Now we (Danes) will play,&quot; he said ominously. Canute blamed the wives of several leading chiefs from Jutland of causing bad weather and ordered his officers to collect such heavy fines from their families that it would have bankrupted all of them. Then he proceeded from assembly to assembly to outlaw any man, sailor, peasant or noble who left Struer until they paid a heavy fine, more than the annual income of any but the wealthiest nobles. Within days the peasants in Vendsyssel, the most northern part of Jutland, rebelled. Royal property was burned, and royal officials were tortured and murdered.

The Jute chiefs decided to cast their lot in with the peasants for once, and the rebellion spread rapidly. Canute and his household and other loyal followers fled from Jutland with the intention of returning to Zealand, where Canute had more support. He was convinced instead however to sail over to Funen and then on to the royal farm (&quot;gård&quot;) at Odense by his trusted adviser, Asbjørn Blak, who also persuaded the king that he could be reconciled with the great landowners and peasants.

Canute and his brothers, Benedict and Erik, and their housecarls went to the king&#x27;s farm outside Odense. When the peasants and their leaders realized the king was at Odense, they raced to the king&#x27;s farm, but Canute and Benedict fled into the little timber church of St. Alban&#x27;s Priory near the river for sanctuary. The rebels refused to recognize sanctuary. &quot;Come out to us, you devil. Too long you have used the edge of your sword to hurt your own people. Now you will feel the edge of our weapons!&quot; Prince Benedict and several others defended the doors. The mob hurled stones and arrows through the windows shouting, &quot;This is for stealing my cow! This is for taking my horses!&quot; Since they couldn&#x27;t get through the heavy outer doors, the mob tried to set fire to the church, but a light rain kept the fire from taking hold. They began tearing at the timber walls to get access. Prince Benedict shouted, &quot;It would be better that you go home to thresh your grain than stand here and exchange blows with the king&#x27;s men!&quot; The remaining defenders retreated to the choir door which separated the altar area from the nave of the church. The floors ran with blood. &quot;There he is!&quot; shouted Blak, but before the traitor could move against the king, he was slain by Prince Benedict. The mob hacked Prince Benedict to death. Canute had received communion and tradition says he offered no resistance when he was killed at the main altar. Forensic evidence suggests he was speared from the front and had his skull smashed, perhaps by a stone thrown through an opening that had been torn through the wall of the choir. Prince Erik, later King Erik Ejegod, managed to talk his way out of the king&#x27;s farm and fled to Zealand and then with his wife and child to Skania. The seventeen housecarls loyal to Canute were massacred within the confines of the church on 10 July 1086.

The Benedictine monks buried Canute and Prince Benedict in front of the main altar of the priory church. The story of Canute&#x27;s death at the altar and his well-known devoutness quickly caught the popular imagination. When his queen, Adela of Flanders, came to move her husband&#x27;s body to Flanders, a bright light shone around St. Alban&#x27;s church. The queen left her husband where he was, and the faithful streamed to the church which housed the remains of their saintly king. Almost immediately there were reports of miraculous healings at the site of his burial. Blind, deaf, and lame were healed. Seven years of famine following Canute&#x27;s death were another sure sign that Canute was worthy of veneration. His brother and successor, Olaf I, was given the nickname Hunger because he was unable to do anything about the famine that ravaged Denmark for years after Canute&#x27;s death.

The unique circumstances of Canute&#x27;s death was seized upon by the Roman Catholic Church as an example of saintliness for the newly converted peoples of Scandinavia. Canute was canonized in 1101 by Pope Pascal II. Some confusion exists among writers about the location of the new St. Canute&#x27;s church thinking it rose on the site of the assassination, but St Alban&#x27;s and St Canute&#x27;s churches were not in the same location. The new cathedral, constructed in imported tuff stone, was constructed a little farther from the river, and was well underway before Canute became a saint. Aelnoth of Canterbury, an English monk, reported the building of St Canute&#x27;s in 1095 and described the miracles reported at the site of Canute&#x27;s grave. When the first church of St. Canute was completed, a three-day fast was proclaimed for the entire kingdom and the remains of Canute and Benedict were moved to the cathedral. It was believed that if the king was truly a saint that the shroud should be set on fire and the body would not be harmed. The shroud of Saint Canute was set alight, and the fire indeed left no mark upon the body of the king.

== Second St. Canute&#x27;s Cathedral ==

During the civil war between Eric IV and his brother, Abel, Odense and the cathedral were burned down in 1247. The present church was constructed in several phases to replace the aging and inadequate stone church in about 1300 by Bishop Gisico (1287–1300). The new cathedral was built in Gothic style with its typical pointed arches and high vaulted ceilings. The building material of choice for the time was oversized red brick which was cheaper and easier to work with than the porous stone available. Portions of the stone cathedral were taken down and the new building expanded around the old.

In all it took approximately two hundred years to complete the cathedral, which was finally dedicated on 30 April 1499. The church was built in cruciform shape without a tower. The ancient crypt was expanded in such a way that pilgrims could visit the reliquary of Saint Canute beneath the raised choir without interfering with the canons&#x27; hourly services above. The canons also claimed they had relics of Saint Alban which Canute supposedly stole on his 1075 attack on Ely, England.

King Hans of Denmark (d. 1513) was buried in the cathedral in 1513. His wife, Christina of Saxony, who lived the latter part of her life in a nunnery in Odense, commissioned the famous German sculptor Claus Berg to create a magnificent burial chapel in the church of the Franciscan friary in Odense, where both she and her husband were laid to rest after her death in 1521. The son of Hans and Christina, King Christian II, with his wife Isabella of Austria and their son Hans, were exhumed from St. Peter&#x27;s Abbey in Ghent, Belgium and reinterred in the royal family chapel in 1883. In 1807 the former Franciscan church was demolished, and Claus Berg&#x27;s magnificent late Gothic altarpiece and the bodies of the four royals were transferred to St. Canute&#x27;s Cathedral. The altarpiece is truly one of Denmark&#x27;s national treasures. It was carved between 1515 and 1525. Each of the three sections is intricately carved and gilded. It survived the iconoclastic fervour of the Reformation perhaps because of its connection with the royal burials.

The single tower was completed in 1586 over the west entrance in the same style as the rest of the cathedral. Five bells hang in the tower. The oldest bell was cast in 1300 by Adam?. The next one was cast in 1597 by Jens Hansen. The next one was cast in 1677 by I. M. The next one was cast in 1767 by Leitze. The newest bell was cast in 1880 by M. P. Allerup.

In 1633 Valkendorf&#x27;s Chapel was added, by all accounts a fine example of Renaissance artistry. Unfortunately it was dismantled in the great restoration of 1868.

Thomas Kingo was made the Lutheran Bishop of Odense in 1634. He was Denmark&#x27;s most famous psalmist and produced a new hymnbook to which he personally contributed 85 hymns.

1752 Amdie Worm&#x27;s spectacular organ was installed. The facade of the organ remains, but the organ has been expanded and improved to become the cherished voice of Odense Cathedral.

During restoration work in the 1870s, the crypt which had been closed since the Reformation was refurbished and opened as a chapel, and Saint Canute once more went on display.

<text>Natural language understanding (NLU) or natural language interpretation (NLI) is a subset of natural language processing in artificial intelligence that deals with machine reading comprehension. NLU has been considered an AI-hard problem.

There is considerable commercial interest in the field because of its application to automated reasoning, machine translation, question answering, news-gathering, text categorization, voice-activation, archiving, and large-scale content analysis.

==History==
The program STUDENT, written in 1964 by Daniel Bobrow for his PhD dissertation at MIT, is one of the earliest known attempts at NLU by a computer. Eight years after John McCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence, Bobrow&#x27;s dissertation (titled &quot;Natural Language Input for a Computer Problem Solving System&quot;) showed how a computer could understand simple natural language input to solve algebra word problems.

A year later, in 1965, Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT wrote ELIZA, an interactive program that carried on a dialogue in English on any topic, the most popular being psychotherapy. ELIZA worked by simple parsing and substitution of key words into canned phrases and Weizenbaum sidestepped the problem of giving the program a database of real-world knowledge or a rich lexicon. Yet ELIZA gained surprising popularity as a toy project and can be seen as a very early precursor to current commercial systems such as those used by Ask.com.

In 1969, Roger Schank at Stanford University introduced the conceptual dependency theory for NLU. This model, partially influenced by the work of Sydney Lamb, was extensively used by Schank&#x27;s students at Yale University, such as Robert Wilensky, Wendy Lehnert, and Janet Kolodner.

In 1970, William A. Woods introduced the augmented transition network (ATN) to represent natural language input. Instead of &quot;phrase structure rules&quot; ATNs used an equivalent set of finite-state automata that were called recursively. ATNs and their more general format called &quot;generalized ATNs&quot; continued to be used for a number of years.

In 1971, Terry Winograd finished writing SHRDLU for his PhD thesis at MIT. SHRDLU could understand simple English sentences in a restricted world of children&#x27;s blocks to direct a robotic arm to move items. The successful demonstration of SHRDLU provided significant momentum for continued research in the field. Winograd continued to be a major influence in the field with the publication of his book &quot;Language as a Cognitive Process&quot;. At Stanford, Winograd would later advise Larry Page, who co-founded Google.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the natural language processing group at SRI International continued research and development in the field. A number of commercial efforts based on the research were undertaken, &quot;e.g.&quot;, in 1982 Gary Hendrix formed Symantec Corporation originally as a company for developing a natural language interface for database queries on personal computers. However, with the advent of mouse-driven graphical user interfaces, Symantec changed direction. A number of other commercial efforts were started around the same time, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Larry R. Harris at the Artificial Intelligence Corporation and Roger Schank and his students at Cognitive Systems Corp. In 1983, Michael Dyer developed the BORIS system at Yale which bore similarities to the work of Roger Schank and W. G. Lehnert.

The third millennium saw the introduction of systems using machine learning for text classification, such as the IBM Watson. However, experts debate how much &quot;understanding&quot; such systems demonstrate: &quot;e.g.&quot;, according to John Searle, Watson did not even understand the questions.

John Ball, cognitive scientist and inventor of the Patom Theory, supports this assessment. Natural language processing has made inroads for applications to support human productivity in service and e-commerce, but this has largely been made possible by narrowing the scope of the application. There are thousands of ways to request something in a human language that still defies conventional natural language processing. According to Wibe Wagemans, &quot;To have a meaningful conversation with machines is only possible when we match every word to the correct meaning based on the meanings of the other words in the sentence – just like a 3-year-old does without guesswork.&quot;

==Scope and context==
The umbrella term &quot;natural language understanding&quot; can be applied to a diverse set of computer applications, ranging from small, relatively simple tasks such as short commands issued to robots, to highly complex endeavors such as the full comprehension of newspaper articles or poetry passages. Many real-world applications fall between the two extremes, for instance text classification for the automatic analysis of emails and their routing to a suitable department in a corporation does not require an in-depth understanding of the text, but needs to deal with a much larger vocabulary and more diverse syntax than the management of simple queries to database tables with fixed schemata.

Throughout the years various attempts at processing natural language or &quot;English-like&quot; sentences presented to computers have taken place at varying degrees of complexity. Some attempts have not resulted in systems with deep understanding, but have helped overall system usability. For example, Wayne Ratliff originally developed the &quot;Vulcan&quot; program with an English-like syntax to mimic the English speaking computer in Star Trek. Vulcan later became the dBase system whose easy-to-use syntax effectively launched the personal computer database industry. Systems with an easy to use or English-like syntax are, however, quite distinct from systems that use a rich lexicon and include an internal representation (often as first order logic) of the semantics of natural language sentences.

Hence the breadth and depth of &quot;understanding&quot; aimed at by a system determine both the complexity of the system (and the implied challenges) and the types of applications it can deal with. The &quot;breadth&quot; of a system is measured by the sizes of its vocabulary and grammar. The &quot;depth&quot; is measured by the degree to which its understanding approximates that of a fluent native speaker. At the narrowest and shallowest, &quot;English-like&quot; command interpreters require minimal complexity, but have a small range of applications. Narrow but deep systems explore and model mechanisms of understanding, but they still have limited application. Systems that attempt to understand the contents of a document such as a news release beyond simple keyword matching and to judge its suitability for a user are broader and require significant complexity, but they are still somewhat shallow. Systems that are both very broad and very deep are beyond the current state of the art.

==Components and architecture==
Regardless of the approach used, most NLU systems share some common components. The system needs a lexicon of the language and a parser and grammar rules to break sentences into an internal representation. The construction of a rich lexicon with a suitable ontology requires significant effort, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the Wordnet lexicon required many person-years of effort.

The system also needs theory from &quot;semantics&quot; to guide the comprehension. The interpretation capabilities of a language-understanding system depend on the semantic theory it uses. Competing semantic theories of language have specific trade-offs in their suitability as the basis of computer-automated semantic interpretation. These range from &quot;naive semantics&quot; or &quot;stochastic semantic analysis&quot; to the use of &quot;pragmatics&quot; to derive meaning from context. Semantic parsers convert natural-language texts into formal meaning representations.

Advanced applications of NLU also attempt to incorporate logical inference within their framework. This is generally achieved by mapping the derived meaning into a set of assertions in predicate logic, then using logical deduction to arrive at conclusions. Therefore, systems based on functional languages such as Lisp need to include a subsystem to represent logical assertions, while logic-oriented systems such as those using the language Prolog generally rely on an extension of the built-in logical representation framework.

The management of context in NLU can present special challenges. A large variety of examples and counter examples have resulted in multiple approaches to the formal modeling of context, each with specific strengths and weaknesses.
