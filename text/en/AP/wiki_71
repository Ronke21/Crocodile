<text>Douglas Sirk (born Hans Detlef Sierck; 26 April 1897 – 14 January 1987) was a German film director best known for his work in Hollywood melodramas of the 1950s. However, he also directed comedies, westerns, and war films. Sirk started his career in Germany as a stage and screen director, but he left for Hollywood in 1937 after his Jewish wife was persecuted by the Nazis.

In the 1950s, he achieved his greatest commercial success with film melodramas &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot;, &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;, &quot;Written on the Wind&quot;, &quot;A Time to Love and a Time to Die&quot;, and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;. While those films were initially panned by critics as sentimental women&#x27;s pictures, they are today widely regarded by film directors, critics, and scholars as masterpieces. His work is seen as a &quot;critique of the bourgeoisie in general and of 1950s America in particular&quot;, while painting a &quot;compassionate portrait of characters trapped by social conditions&quot;. Beyond the surface of the film, Sirk worked with complex mise-en-scène and lush Technicolor to underline his statements.

==Life and work==
===Early life and career in Germany===
Sirk was born Hans Detlef Sierck on 26 April 1897, in Hamburg, of Danish parentage; his father was a newspaper reporter. He spent a few years in Denmark as a child, before his parents returned to Germany and became citizens. Sirk discovered the theatre in his mid-teens, particularly Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays, and also began to frequent the cinema, where he first encountered what he later described as &quot;dramas of swollen emotions&quot;; one of his early screen favourites was Danish-born actress Asta Nielsen. In 1919, he enrolled to study law at Munich University, but he left Munich following the violent collapse of a short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic. Between stints at university, he began writing for his father&#x27;s newspaper, not long before his father became a school principal.

Sirk continued his studies for a time at the University of Jena before transferring to Hamburg University, where he switched to philosophy and the history of art. It was here that he attended a lecture on relativity given by Albert Einstein. A major influence in this period was art historian Erwin Panofsky - Sirk was a select member of Panofsky&#x27;s seminar group for a semester and wrote a large essay for him on the relationship between Medieval German painting and the mystery plays; in his 1971 interview with Halliday, Sirk declared, &quot;I owe Panofsky a lot.&quot; To support himself while studying, Sirk began working as a second-line &quot;dramaturg&quot; at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. In 1922, substituting for a director who had fallen sick, Sirk directed his first production, the Hermann Bossdorf play &quot;Bahnmeister Tod&quot; (&quot;Stationmaster Death&quot;), which became a surprise success, and from that point Sirk was (in his own words) &quot;lost to the theatre&quot;. In addition to the theatre, Sirk worked in many areas of the arts during this formative period - he painted, took a summer job as a set-designer at a Berlin film studio, published his own German translation of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets, translated some of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and published writings of his own.

Schauspielhaus manager Dr Paul Eger offered Sirk a pay raise and the chance to present &quot;one of those crazy modern [i.e. Expressionist ] plays&quot; but Sirk declared that he only wanted to direct &quot;the classics&quot; and took up an offer to become first director at a playhouse in Chemnitz in Saxony. The post proved to be a baptism of fire for the new director - although the company started out with classic works by Molière, Büchner and Strindberg, the season was disrupted when the theatre&#x27;s main financier and manager gave up and vanished overnight, forcing the cast and crew to form a collective to keep the theatre going, and the program soon changed to comedies and melodramas - &quot;things that made money&quot;. Although Sirk later recalled the period as &quot;a pretty terrible time&quot;, it was here that he learned his craft, and how to handle actors in &quot;the &quot;most&quot; strained circumstances&quot;. This was during the period of runaway inflation in Germany, and Sirk remembered that after distributing money to the company, they would have to run to the bank with their takings just before midday, because at 12 pm the banks would close their shutters and post the new dollar rate - &quot;... if you got in too late, you had just a small percentage left of what you had earned ...&quot;

With his first wife the actress Lydia Brincken Sirk fathered one son, Klaus Detlef Sierck (1925–1944), born on 30 March 1925 in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Germany. His ex-wife joined the Nazi party and because of Sirk&#x27;s remarriage to a Jewish woman was able to legally bar him from seeing their son, who became one of the leading child actors of Nazi Germany, known for &quot;Die Saat geht auf&quot; (1935), &quot;Streit um den Knaben Jo&quot; (1937) and &quot;Kopf hoch, Johannes!&quot; (1941). He died as a soldier of the Panzer-Grenadier-Division Großdeutschland on 22 May 1944 near Novoaleksandrovka, Kirovograd Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, USSR (now Novooleksandrivka, Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine).

By the 1930s Sirk had become one of Germany&#x27;s leading stage directors, with a list of credits that included a production of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. Sirk joined UFA (Universum Film AG) studios in 1934, where he directed three shorts, followed by his first feature, &quot;April, April&quot; (1935), which was filmed in both German and Dutch versions. His exotic melodrama films &quot;Zu neuen Ufern&quot; and &quot;La Habanera&quot; made a star of the Nazi cinema out of Swedish singer Zarah Leander.

===Career in the U.S.===

Sirk left Germany in 1937 because of his political leanings and his Jewish (second) wife, actress Hilde Jary. Still in Europe he worked on films in Switzerland and the Netherlands. On arrival in the United States, he soon changed his German birth name to Douglas Sirk. By 1942, he was under contract to Columbia Pictures and directing the stridently anti-Nazi &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Madman&quot; for Seymour Nebenzal, the legendary producer of Nero-Film, for whom Sirk also directed &quot;Summer Storm&quot; (1944).

Sirk briefly returned to Germany after the war ended, but returned to the U.S. and established his reputation with a series of lush, colorful melodramas for Universal-International Pictures from 1952 to 1959: &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; (1954), &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955), &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956), &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; (1957), &quot;The Tarnished Angels&quot; (1957), &quot;A Time to Love and a Time to Die&quot; (1958), and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1959).

Despite the enormous success of &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; in 1959 (partially fueled by the scandal surrounding the murder of Lana Turner&#x27;s boyfriend by her daughter), Sirk left the United States and retired from filmmaking. He died in Lugano, Switzerland, nearly 30 years later, with only a brief return behind the camera in West Germany in the 1970s, teaching at the film school Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film in Munich.

==Reputation and legacy==
===Contemporary reception===
Sirk&#x27;s melodramas of the 1950s, while highly commercially successful, were generally very poorly received by reviewers. His films were considered unimportant (because they revolve around female and domestic issues), banal (because of their focus on larger-than-life feelings) and unrealistic (because of their conspicuous and distinctive style). Their often melodramatic manner was viewed by critics as being in bad taste.

===Later reception===
Attitudes toward Sirk&#x27;s films changed drastically in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s as his work was re-examined by French, American, and British critics. As Jean-Luc Godard wrote in his review of &quot;A Time to Love and a Time to Die&quot; (1958), &quot;...I am going to write a madly enthusiastic review of Douglas Sirk&#x27;s latest film, simply because it set my cheeks afire.&quot;

The major critical reappraisal of Sirk began in France with the April 1967 issue of &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, which included an extended interview with Sirk by Serge Daney and Jean-Louis Noames, an appreciation by Jean-Louis Comolli (&quot;The Blind Man and the Mirror or The Impossible Cinema of Douglas Sirk&quot;), and a &quot;biofilmographie&quot; compiled by Patrick Brion and Dominique Rabourdin. Leading American critic Andrew Sarris praised Sirk in his 1968 book &quot;The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968&quot;, although Sirk failed to qualify for Sarris&#x27; controversial &quot;pantheon&quot; of great directors. From around 1970 there was a burgeoning interest among academic film scholars for Sirk&#x27;s work - especially his American melodramas. The seminal work in this field was Jon Halliday&#x27;s book-length interview, &quot;Sirk on Sirk&quot; (1971) which presented Sirk as &quot;... a sophisticated intellectual, a filmmaker who arrived in Hollywood with a very clear vision, leaving behind him an established career in German theatre and film&quot;.

Several major revival seasons of Sirk&#x27;s films followed over the next few years, including a 20-film retrospective at the 1972 Edinburgh Festival (which Sirk attended), which also generated a book of essays. In 1974 the University of Connecticut Film Society programmed a complete retrospective of the director&#x27;s American films, and invited Sirk to attend, but on the way to the airport, for the flight to New York, Sirk suffered a haemorrhage that seriously impaired the vision in his left eye.

Analyses of Sirk&#x27;s work, with their emphases on aspects of Sirk&#x27;s formerly-criticized style, revealed an oblique criticism of American society hidden beneath a banal facade of plotting conventional for the era - Sirk&#x27;s films were now seen as masterpieces of irony. The criticism of the 1970s and early 1980s was dominated by an ideological take on Sirk&#x27;s work, gradually changing from Marxist-inspired visions in the early 1970s, to a focus on gender and sexuality in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Film critic Roger Ebert has said, &quot;To appreciate a film like &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; probably takes more sophistication to understand than one of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s masterpieces, because Bergman&#x27;s themes are visible and underlined, while with Sirk the style conceals the message.&quot;

Sirk&#x27;s reputation was also helped by a widespread nostalgia for old-fashioned Hollywood films in the 1970s. His work is now widely considered to show excellent control of visuals, extending from lighting and framing to costumes and sets that are saturated with symbolism and shot through with subtle barbs of irony.

==In popular culture==
Sirk&#x27;s films have been quoted in films by directors such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder (whose &quot;&quot; is partly based on &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;) and, later, Quentin Tarantino, Todd Haynes, Pedro Almodóvar, Wong Kar-wai, David Lynch, John Waters and Lars von Trier.

More specifically, Almodóvar&#x27;s vibrant use of color in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; recalls the cinematography of Sirk&#x27;s films of the 1950s, while Haynes&#x27; &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical Sirk melodrama—in particular &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;. Tarantino paid homage to Sirk and his melodramatic style in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, when character Vincent Vega, at a &#x27;50s-themed restaurant, orders the &quot;Douglas Sirk steak&quot; cooked &quot;bloody as hell&quot;. Aki Kaurismäki alluded to Sirk as well; in his silent film, &quot;Juha&quot;, the villain&#x27;s sport car is named &quot;Sierck&quot;. Sirk was also one of the directors mentioned by Guillermo del Toro in his Oscar acceptance speech for Best Picture for &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; : &quot;Growing up in Mexico as a kid, I was a big admirer of foreign film. Foreign film, like &quot;E.T.&quot;, William Wyler, or Douglas Sirk, or Frank Capra.&quot;

&quot;Polyester&quot; (1981) directed by Waters was, according to Waters, informed by Sirk&#x27;s Universal melodramas.

<text>Kennedy Range National Park is a national park in Gascoyne region of Western Australia, approximately north of Perth and about east of Carnarvon.

Kennedy Range is found on the edge of the Gascoyne River catchment area and is a weathered plateau that extends for a distance of , essentially forming a huge mesa. Spectacular sandstone cliffs can be found on the southern and eastern sides of the range, which are dissected by steep canyons which have an elevation of up to .

The Range formed a natural border for two Aboriginal peoples, the Maia and the Malgaru. Natural springs located on the edge of the ranges would have provided game to hunt and outcrops of chert would have provided stone for tools. Over 100 sites provide evidence that the Indigenous Australians inhabited the area for over 20,000 years prior to European settlement.

The first European to explore the area was Francis Thomas Gregory, whose expedition reached the range in 1858. Gregory named the range after the Governor of Western Australia at the time, Arthur Edward Kennedy.
He also named the nearby Lyons River in the same expedition before continuing to Mount Augustus. Pastoralists arrived in the area shortly afterwards with Charles Brockman setting up Boolathana Station in 1877, and the region experienced success in wool production until the 1930s when the overgrazing, drought and the Great Depression caused most businesses to fail.

The valleys and plains of the range had been severely degraded but the range top was only slightly damaged as a result of pastoral activity. The area has been explored for minerals but has not been mined.

The park was officially gazetted in 1993 and contains some facilities for visitors. A bush toilet and camp-sites are located at Temple Gorge, but it is planned to relocate this camp ground. There are a number of walk trails within the park but no water is available. Entry to the park is free but camp-site fees apply.

A popular time to visit the park is following heavy rains when wildflowers emerge. Over 80 species of wildflower are known to inhabit the park, including mulla mulla, &quot;hakeas&quot;, &quot;eremophilas&quot;, &quot;Calytrix&quot;, &quot;verticordias&quot; and various everlasting daisies.

A species of lizard &quot;Lerista kennedyensis&quot;, commonly called the &quot;Kennedy Range broad-blazed slider&quot;, is named after the Kennedy Range.

<text>In mathematics and applied mathematics, perturbation theory comprises methods for finding an approximate solution to a problem, by starting from the exact solution of a related, simpler problem. A critical feature of the technique is a middle step that breaks the problem into &quot;solvable&quot; and &quot;perturbative&quot; parts. In regular perturbation theory, the solution is expressed as a power series in a small parameter The first term is the known solution to the solvable problem. Successive terms in the series at higher powers of formula_1 usually become smaller. An approximate &#x27;perturbation solution&#x27; is obtained by truncating the series, often keeping only the first two terms, the solution to the known problem and the &#x27;first order&#x27; perturbation correction.

Perturbation theory is used in a wide range of fields and reaches its most sophisticated and advanced forms in quantum field theory. Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) describes the use of this method in quantum mechanics. The field in general remains actively and heavily researched across multiple disciplines.

== Description ==
Perturbation theory develops an expression for the desired solution in terms of a formal power series known as a perturbation series in some &quot;small&quot; parameter, that quantifies the deviation from the exactly solvable problem. The leading term in this power series is the solution of the exactly solvable problem, while further terms describe the deviation in the solution, due to the deviation from the initial problem. Formally, we have for the approximation to the full solution formula_2 a series in the small parameter (here called ), like the following:

:formula_3

In this example, formula_4 would be the known solution to the exactly solvable initial problem, and the terms formula_5 represent the first-order, second-order, third-order, and higher-order terms, which may be found iteratively by a mechanistic but increasingly difficult procedure. For small formula_6 these higher-order terms in the series generally (but not always) become successively smaller. An approximate &quot;perturbative solution&quot; is obtained by truncating the series, often by keeping only the first two terms, expressing the final solution as a sum of the initial (exact) solution and the &quot;first-order&quot; perturbative correction 
:formula_7

Some authors use big O notation to indicate the order of the error in the approximate solution: 

If the power series in formula_6 converges with a nonzero radius of convergence, the perturbation problem is called a regular perturbation problem. In regular perturbation problems, the asymptotic solution smoothly approaches the exact solution. However, the perturbation series can also diverge, and the truncated series can still be a good approximation to the true solution if it is truncated at a point at which its elements are minimum. This is called an &quot;asymptotic series&quot;. If the perturbation series is divergent or not a power series (for example, if the asymptotic expansion must include non-integer powers formula_9 or negative powers formula_10) then the perturbation problem is called a singular perturbation problem. Many special techniques in perturbation theory have been developed to analyze singular perturbation problems.

==Prototypical example==
The earliest use of what would now be called &quot;perturbation theory&quot; was to deal with the otherwise unsolvable mathematical problems of celestial mechanics: for example the orbit of the Moon, which moves noticeably differently from a simple Keplerian ellipse because of the competing gravitation of the Earth and the Sun.

Perturbation methods start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is &quot;simple enough&quot; to be solved exactly. In celestial mechanics, this is usually a Keplerian ellipse. Under Newtonian gravity, an ellipse is exactly correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the Earth and the Moon) but not quite correct when there are three or more objects (say, the Earth, Moon, Sun, and the rest of the Solar System) and not quite correct when the gravitational interaction is stated using formulations from general relativity.

==Perturbative expansion==
Keeping the above example in mind, one follows a general recipe to obtain the perturbation series. The perturbative expansion is created by adding successive corrections to the simplified problem. The corrections are obtained by forcing consistency between the unperturbed solution, and the equations describing the system in full. Write formula_11 for this collection of equations; that is, let the symbol formula_11 stand in for the problem to be solved. Quite often, these are differential equations, thus, the letter &quot;D&quot;.

The process is generally mechanical, if laborious. One begins by writing the equations formula_11 so that they split into two parts: some collection of equations formula_14 which can be solved exactly, and some additional remaining part formula_15 for some small formula_16 The solution formula_4 (to formula_14) is known, and one seeks the general solution formula_19 to formula_20

Next the approximation formula_21 is inserted into formula_22. This results in an equation for formula_23 which, in the general case, can be written in closed form as a sum over integrals over formula_24 Thus, one has obtained the &quot;first-order correction&quot; formula_25 and thus formula_21 is a good approximation to formula_27 It is a good approximation, precisely because the parts that were ignored were of size formula_28 The process can then be repeated, to obtain corrections formula_29 and so on.

In practice, this process rapidly explodes into a profusion of terms, which become extremely hard to manage by hand. Isaac Newton is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the Moon&#x27;s orbit, that &quot;It causeth my head to ache.&quot; This unmanageability has forced perturbation theory to develop into a high art of managing and writing out these higher order terms. One of the fundamental breakthroughs in quantum mechanics for controlling the expansion are the Feynman diagrams, which allow quantum mechanical perturbation series to be represented by a sketch.

==Examples==
Perturbation theory has been used in a large number of different settings in physics and applied mathematics. Examples of the &quot;collection of equations&quot; formula_30 include algebraic equations,
differential equations (e.g., the equations of motion
and commonly wave equations), thermodynamic free energy in statistical mechanics, radiative transfer,
and Hamiltonian operators in quantum mechanics.

Examples of the kinds of solutions that are found perturbatively include the solution of the equation of motion (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the trajectory of a particle), the statistical average of some physical quantity (&quot;e.g.&quot;, average magnetization), and the ground state energy of a quantum mechanical problem.

Examples of exactly solvable problems that can be used as starting points include linear equations, including linear equations of motion (harmonic oscillator, linear wave equation), statistical or quantum-mechanical systems of non-interacting particles (or in general, Hamiltonians or free energies containing only terms quadratic in all degrees of freedom).

Examples of systems that can be solved with perturbations include systems with nonlinear contributions to the equations of motion, interactions between particles, terms of higher powers in the Hamiltonian/free energy.

For physical problems involving interactions between particles, the terms of the perturbation series may be displayed (and manipulated) using Feynman diagrams.

==History==
Perturbation theory was first devised to solve otherwise intractable problems in the calculation of the motions of planets in the solar system. For instance, Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation explained the gravitation between two astronomical bodies, but when a third body is added, the problem was, &quot;How does each body pull on each?&quot; Kepler&#x27;s orbital equations only solve Newton&#x27;s gravitational equations when the latter are limited to just two bodies interacting. The gradually increasing accuracy of astronomical observations led to incremental demands in the accuracy of solutions to Newton&#x27;s gravitational equations, which led many eminent 18th and 19th century mathematicians, notably Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre-Simon Laplace, to extend and generalize the methods of perturbation theory.

These well-developed perturbation methods were adopted and adapted to solve new problems arising during the development of quantum mechanics in 20th century atomic and subatomic physics. Paul Dirac developed quantum perturbation theory in 1927 to evaluate when a particle would be emitted in radioactive elements. This was later named Fermi&#x27;s golden rule. Perturbation theory in quantum mechanics is fairly accessible, mainly because quantum mechanics is limited to linear wave equations, but also since the quantum mechanical notation allows expressions to be written in fairly compact form, thus making them easier to comprehend. This resulted in an explosion of applications, ranging from the Zeeman effect to the hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen atom.

Despite the simpler notation, perturbation theory applied to quantum field theory still easily gets out of hand. Richard Feynman developed the celebrated Feynman diagrams by observing that many terms repeat in a regular fashion. These terms can be replaced by dots, lines, squiggles and similar marks, each standing for a term, a denominator, an integral, and so on; thus complex integrals can be written as simple diagrams, with absolutely no ambiguity as to what they mean. The one-to-one correspondence between the diagrams, and specific integrals is what gives them their power. Although originally developed for quantum field theory, it turns out the diagrammatic technique is broadly applicable to many other perturbative series (although not always worthwhile).

In the second half of the 20th century, as chaos theory developed, it became clear that unperturbed systems were in general completely integrable systems, while the perturbed systems were not. This promptly lead to the study of &quot;nearly integrable systems&quot;, of which the KAM torus is the canonical example. At the same time, it was also discovered that many (rather special) non-linear systems, which were previously approachable only through perturbation theory, are in fact completely integrable. This discovery was quite dramatic, as it allowed exact solutions to be given. This, in turn, helped clarify the meaning of the perturbative series, as one could now compare the results of the series to the exact solutions.

The improved understanding of dynamical systems coming from chaos theory helped shed light on what was termed the &quot;small denominator problem&quot; or &quot;small divisor problem&quot;. In the 19th century Poincaré observed (as perhaps had earlier mathematicians) that sometimes 2nd and higher order terms in the perturbative series have &quot;small denominators&quot;: That is, they have the general form formula_31 where formula_32 formula_33 and formula_34 are some complicated expressions pertinent to the problem to be solved, and formula_35 and formula_36 are real numbers; very often they are the energy of normal modes. The small divisor problem arises when the difference formula_37 is small, causing the perturbative correction to &quot;blow up&quot;, becoming as large or maybe larger than the zeroth order term. This situation signals a breakdown of perturbation theory: It stops working at this point, and cannot be expanded or summed any further. In formal terms, the perturbative series is an &quot;asymptotic series&quot;: A useful approximation for a few terms, but at some point becomes &quot;less&quot; accurate if even more terms are added. The breakthrough from chaos theory was an explanation of why this happened: The small divisors occur whenever perturbation theory is applied to a chaotic system. The one signals the presence of the other.

===Beginnings in the study of planetary motion===
Since the planets are very remote from each other, and since their mass is small as compared to the mass of the Sun, the gravitational forces between the planets can be neglected, and the planetary motion is considered, to a first approximation, as taking place along Kepler&#x27;s orbits, which are defined by the equations of the two-body problem, the two bodies being the planet and the Sun.

Since astronomic data came to be known with much greater accuracy, it became necessary to consider how the motion of a planet around the Sun is affected by other planets. This was the origin of the three-body problem; thus, in studying the system Moon-Earth-Sun, the mass ratio between the Moon and the Earth was chosen as the &quot;small parameter&quot;. Lagrange and Laplace were the first to advance the view that the so-called &quot;constants&quot; which describe the motion of a planet around the Sun gradually change: They are &quot;perturbed&quot;, as it were, by the motion of other planets and vary as a function of time; hence the name &quot;perturbation theory&quot;.

Perturbation theory was investigated by the classical scholars – Laplace, Siméon Denis Poisson, Carl Friedrich Gauss – as a result of which the computations could be performed with a very high accuracy. The discovery of the planet Neptune in 1848 by Urbain Le Verrier, based on the deviations in motion of the planet Uranus. He sent the coordinates to J.G. Galle who successfully observed Neptune through his telescope – a triumph of perturbation theory.

==Perturbation orders==
The standard exposition of perturbation theory is given in terms of the order to which the perturbation is carried out: first-order perturbation theory or second-order perturbation theory, and whether the perturbed states are degenerate, which requires singular perturbation. In the singular case extra care must be taken, and the theory is slightly more elaborate.

==In chemistry==
Many of the ab initio quantum chemistry methods use perturbation theory directly or are closely related methods. Implicit perturbation theory works with the complete Hamiltonian from the very beginning and never specifies a perturbation operator as such. Møller–Plesset perturbation theory uses the difference between the Hartree–Fock Hamiltonian and the exact non-relativistic Hamiltonian as the perturbation. The zero-order energy is the sum of orbital energies. The first-order energy is the Hartree–Fock energy and electron correlation is included at second-order or higher. Calculations to second, third or fourth order are very common and the code is included in most &quot;ab initio&quot; quantum chemistry programs. A related but more accurate method is the coupled cluster method.

== Shell-crossing ==
A shell-crossing (sc) occurs in perturbation theory when matter trajectories intersect, forming a singularity. This limits the predictive power of physical simulations at small scales.

<doc id="102141" wikidata="Q60167" url="?curid=102141" title="Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park">
<text>Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park is a national park in the South West region of Western Australia, south of Perth.
It is named after the two capes either end of the park, Cape Leeuwin and Cape Naturaliste.
It is located in the Augusta-Margaret River and Busselton council areas, and is claimed to have the highest visiting numbers of any national park in Western Australia. The park received 2.33 million visitors through 2008–2009.

==Description==
The park extends over , from Cape Naturaliste in the north to Cape Leeuwin in the south. It is composed of 28 separate reserves, which together have an area of about . Despite the park&#x27;s large size, the reserves are fragmented, and in many places the park consists only of a narrow coastal strip.

It has many features of interest including limestone and granite outcrops like Sugarloaf Rock and Canal Rocks. The coastal area also contains many beaches with well-known surf breaks, such as Supertubes, Yallingup Beach, and Smiths Beach. Other coastal features include coastal cliffs and aeolian dunes. The park contains many caves, some of which are accessible by the public. There are brackish and freshwater lakes and springs, and the park is crossed by several creeks and rivers, including the Margaret River.

The park either passes through or contains historic sites including the Cape Leeuwin water wheel.

==Leeuwin–Naturaliste Ridge==
The Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge is a discontinuous strip of coastal dune limestone running north–south and extending along the western shore, parallel to the coast from Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin. The ridge is composed of two landform elements, Tamala Limestone and the basement rock the limestone formed on, called the Leeuwin Complex.

Tamala Limestone is a naturally occurring eolianite limestone, found in deposits on the western coastline of Western Australia.

The Leeuwin Complex is a strongly metamorphosed igneous Proterozoic rock made up mostly of granitic and anorthositic gneisses. The Dunsborough Fault forms the eastern boundary of the Leeuwin Complex where it adjoins the sedimentary Perth Basin.

The ridge&#x27;s geology and the variations in vegetation are confined to a number of very narrow bands that follow the north–south orientation of the ridge.

== Caves ==
The Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge contains over 150 caves, formed via the erosion of Tamala Limestone. Within the national park, six caves are accessible to the public.

=== Ngilgi Cave ===

Ngilgi Cave, previously known as Yallingup Cave is a cave to the northeast of Yallingup, available for semi-guided tours.

=== Calgardup Cave ===
Calgardup Cave is a cave available for self-guided tours.

=== Mammoth Cave ===

Mammoth Cave is a cave available for self-guided audio tours.

=== Lake Cave ===
Lake Cave is a cave available for guided tours.

=== Giants Cave ===
Calgardup Cave is a cave available for self-guided tours.

=== Jewel Cave ===
Jewel Cave is a cave available for guided tours.

==Flora and fauna==
The park contains a large range of geologic features and soil types. The landscape and soil diversity supports a range of plant communities. These include coastal herblands and grasslands, sedgelands, and heath near the coast. Further inland are shrublands, woodlands, and forests, including peppermint tree (&quot;Agonis flexuosa&quot;) and &quot;Banksia&quot; shrubland and woodland, and significant stands of tall karri (&quot;Eucalyptus diversicolor&quot;) and jarrah (&quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot;) forest.

A large variety of bird species inhabit the park including many sea birds, red-eared firetail, white-breasted robin, rock parrot and emu. Native mammals that can be found within the park include southern brown bandicoots, western grey kangaroos, western ringtail possums and brush wallabies.

==Conservation==

The national park was created from crown lands along the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge at a time after the main primary industries in the region had been dairying and forestry, and when increased land-use conflict was arising from the spread of wineries, increased population on hobby farms and other agricultural activities.

Since then many competing land uses have created a complex land management scenario for state and local government authorities trying to mediate quite conflicting issues. The national park is located on some of the most vulnerable land in the region.

==2021 Bushfire==

On 8 December 2021, a bush fire began near Mammoth Cave within Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park, said to have been deliberately lit. WA premier Mark McGowan urged people to leave the area as soon as possible due to high fuel loads and dangerous conditions. The fire burned through more than 3,200 ha (7,900 acres) by the following day.

==Cape to Cape Track==

In 2001, the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) opened the Cape to Cape Track, a 135 kilometre walking track along the Leeuwin-Naturaliste ridge.

<text>Lesueur National Park is a national park straddling the boundary between the Wheatbelt and Mid West regions of Western Australia, 211 km north of Perth. The park was gazetted in 1992. It includes two mesas known as Mount Lesueur and Mount Michaud, and supports a highly diverse flora.

==Flora==
Lesueur National Park lies in the Geraldton Sandplains bioregion, which is characterised by scrubby heath with a high number of plants from the family Proteaceae.

Vegetation in the park is structurally complex, with patches of woodland amongst shrublands.

There are over 900 indigenous plant species in the park, many of which are endemic. Rare or threatened species include the Mount Lesueur Grevillea, Forrest&#x27;s Wattle, the Lesueur Hakea and the Laterite Mallee.

The park is the northern limit for Jarrah and Mountain Marri, both of which grow as mallees instead of the more usual tall tree form.

Lesueur National Park is under threat from the effects of Phytophthora dieback, a disease which kills plants and is spread through movement of infected soil or water.

== 1980s coal mining and power station proposals ==

In the 1980s, due to appraisals of coal deposits in the area, the Mount Lesueur and Hill River areas were in controversy over proposed coal mining and power station development, until the creation of the National Park in 1990.

<text>Millstream Chichester National Park is a national park in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, located north of the state capital, Perth.

The park is made up of the old Millstream Station, which is on the Millstream Creek, just before it joins Fortescue River, one of the few permanent watercourses in the area and the Chichester Range.

==History==
The area is homeland of the Yinjibarndi people. Millstream Creek was named by the explorer Francis Thomas Gregory in 1861. He reported the favourable grazing prospects. The first pastoral lease was taken up on 1865.

By 1907 the property was owned by Loton and Padbury, and occupied an area of . It was stocked with 20,500 sheep, 1,900 cattle and 150 horses, and was passed in at auction at £26,000, equivalent to in .

The present Millstream Homestead was built in 1920. The homestead was a tavern between 1975 and 1986.

In 1970, the Chichester Range National Park was set aside and officially named. In 1975, the Conservation through Reserves Committee made recommendations for reserves in the Pilbara region, and subsequently, the Millstream region was integrated into the park in 1982.

The Yindjibarndi people work as rangers and contractors in the park. The Millstream Homestead Visitor Centre is in the old homestead, which feature rooms dedicated to the Yinjibarndi people, the early settlers and the natural environment. Other displays provide information about the park&#x27;s attractions and management challenges.

== Climate ==
The Pilbara is located within the arid tropics. During summer, between October and April, temperatures rise above , and cyclones and local thunderstorms can flood roads and watercourses. The cool season, between May and August, experiences little rain, with daytime temperatures around . Nights at this time of year can be cool, so warm clothes may be necessary.

== Camping ==
Camping is available at Miliyanha and Stargazers campgrounds. Miliyanha has a camp kitchen, toilets and generators are allowed. It has some shade in the mornings and afternoon. Stargazers is a more open site and generators are not permitted. A gas BBQ and toilets are provided. Both campgrounds are suitable for tent camping up to very large caravans and motorhomes, and can be accessed by two-wheel drive vehicles in good weather. Information concerning road conditions can be obtained from the Shire of Ashburton.

Snake Creek Campground has been closed to campers since 2011, and Crossing Pool has been closed to campers since 2013 due to safety issues concerning a drop in water levels and tree death.

== Culture ==
=== Yindjibarndi people ===
The Millstream Chichester area is a very significant Aboriginal cultural site in northern Australia. Its cultural and mythological importance stems from thousands of years of occupation, with Millstream being the home of the serpent or Warlu, similar to the Wagyl, whose presence is still strongly felt at (&quot;Deep Reach Pool&quot;). All the pools are significant in this regard and warrant a high level of respect because of their spiritual and mythological importance.

The broad area of land straddling the Fortescue River () from the Hamersley Range through to the Chichester escarpment is the homeland of the Yindjibarndi people. The Ngarluma people&#x27;s lands run from the Chichester escarpment northward to the sea.

Aside from its highly important spiritual significance, Millstream was an important campsite for inter-tribal meetings. The Fortescue River provided food and water, particularly during drier months. Along the river, Aboriginal people had a varied diet of red meat, fish, reptiles, grubs, eggs, honey fruits and root vegetables. Extensive areas were burnt to create natural paddocks and attract kangaroos. The dry climate meant that knowledge of the locations of waterholes was important. The Aboriginal people (Ngardangarli) were skilled in land management and were nomadic within their traditional boundaries.

Yindjibarndi and Ngarluma people continue to come to the park to spend time on country and to carry out customary activities. They are also represented on the Jirndawurrunhs Park Council which, in association with the Department of Parks and Wildlife, manages the strategic direction of the park.

<doc id="102146" wikidata="Q10834066" url="?curid=102146" title="Mount Augustus National Park">
<text>Mount Augustus National Park is located 852 km north of Perth, 490 km by road east of Carnarvon and 390 km northwest of Meekatharra, in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia. Mount Augustus itself, the feature around which the national park is based, is known as &quot;Burringurrah&quot; to the local Wadjari Aboriginal people.

==Mount Augustus==

Mount Augustus is an inselberg or monocline, not a monolith as often stated in tourist literature.

There is a caravan park at nearby Mount Augustus Station homestead, which also has &quot;&quot; style accommodation and a restaurant which is open in peak tourist season.

==Geology==
Mount Augustus is composed of sandstone and conglomerate, a formation known to geologists as the Mount Augustus Sandstone, which overlies older granite near its northern end. The Mount Augustus Sandstone was deposited by ancient river systems and is somewhat younger than the 1.64 billion year old granite beneath. The originally horizontal sediments have been folded into an asymmetric anticline by later tectonic movements.

==European history==
Francis Thomas Gregory reached the summit on 3 June 1858 during his 107-day journey through the Gascoyne region, becoming the first recorded European to climb the mountain. Some weeks later he named the peak after his brother, Sir Augustus Charles Gregory (1819–1905). At the time Augustus was on his last expedition, an unsuccessful foray into western Queensland in an attempt to discover the whereabouts of Ludwig Leichhardt.

The pastoral lease, Mount Augustus Station, which once included Mount Augustus was settled in 1887. A portion of this lease along with a portion of the Cobra Station lease, totalling were voluntarily released in 1989 to create the National Park.

<doc id="102147" wikidata="Q1950308" url="?curid=102147" title="Mount Frankland National Park">
<text>Mount Frankland National Park is a national park in the South West region of Western Australia, south of Perth. The park is part of the larger Walpole Wilderness Area that was established in 2004, an international biodiversity hotspot.

==Geography==
It covers an area of 371.22 square kilometres in the low granite hills to the north of the town of Walpole.

Mount Frankland (411 metres), known as Caldyanup to the aboriginal inhabitants, is a granite peak which offers panoramic views across the landscape. There is a fire lookout atop the mountain. The mountain was named in 1829 by Thomas Braidwood Wilson after George Frankland, who was then Surveyor General of Tasmania.

The park extends from northwest to southeast. It is bounded on the north by Mount Frankland North National Park, on the east by Mount Roe National Park, on the south by Mount Frankland South National Park, and on the west by Shannon National Park.

==Climate==
Annual rainfall at Walpole is around . On the 422-metre high peak of Mount Frankland, though no rain gauge has ever been installed, annual rainfall is probably around . Most rain falls between May and August, but unlike drier parts of southwestern Australia, showers are not infrequent even during the summer.

==Flora and fauna==
The park is covered largely by forests of karri (&quot;Eucalyptus diversicolor&quot;) and red tingle (&quot;Eucalyptus jacksonii&quot;), two of the world&#x27;s largest trees. The three tingle species are unique to the area between the park and the coast and the only eucalypts to be buttressed, a feature which reflects the moist conditions prevailing within the park.

Low heathland is the dominant vegetation on the thin soil over the park&#x27;s many granite outcrops.

==Recreation==
There are several walking trails in the park, ranging from wheelchair-accessible to difficult. 

An unsealed road, usable by conventional vehicles, provides auto access to a car park within the park. There are picnic areas with gas barbecues and toilets 100 metres from the car park, and a treetop-level wilderness lookout further on.

<doc id="102148" wikidata="Q1362815" url="?curid=102148" title="Nambung National Park">
<text>Nambung National Park is a national park in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, 200 km northwest of Perth, Australia and 17 km south of the small coastal town of Cervantes. The park contains the Pinnacles Desert which is an area with thousands of limestone formations called &quot;pinnacles&quot;.

The park derives its name from an indigenous Australian word possibly meaning crooked or winding. The word was used in 1938 when naming the Nambung River which flows into the park and disappears into a cave system within the limestone. The Yued people are the acknowledged traditional custodians of the land since before the arrival of Europeans.

Nambung National Park also contains beaches at Kangaroo Point and Hangover Bay, as well as coastal dunes and flowering plants in low heathland areas. A boardwalk in the northern area of the park at Lake Thetis allows visitors to view thrombolites which, like stromatolites, are structures built by micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria. Some of the fossilized thrombolites have been dated to 3.6 billion years old. The Pinnacles Desert Discovery Centre features exhibits about the geology of the pinnacles formations and the cultural and natural heritage values of the area.

==History==
Europeans first visited the area in 1658 when Dutch maps recorded North and South Hummocks on their maps. Phillip Parker King also mentioned the Hummocks in his journals in 1820. The Pinnacles Desert area remained relatively unknown until surveyed in 1934. The national park was created in July 1994 by combining three separate reserve areas gazetted in 1956, 1967 (the Pinnacles) and 1968.

==Geography==
The park is bordered to the north by the Southern Beekeeper&#x27;s Nature Reserve and to the south by Wanagarren Nature Reserve. A large area of vacant Crown land is found along much of the eastern boundary while the Indian Ocean defines the park&#x27;s western boundary. Visitors can access the Pinnacles Desert from points north or south of Cervantes via the Indian Ocean Drive or via Cervantes Road from the east. The park is located 17 km south of Cervantes.

==Geology==

The Pinnacles Desert contains thousands of limestone pillars. The pillars are the weathered and eroded fragments of limestone beds composed of deposited marine organisms such as coral and molluscs. Some of the tallest pinnacles reach heights of up to 3.5m above the yellow sand base. The different types of formations include ones which are much taller than they are wide and resemble columnssuggesting the name of Pinnacleswhile others are only a metre or so in height and width resembling short tombstones. A cross-bedding structure can be observed in many pinnacles where the angle of deposited sand changed suddenly due to changes in prevailing winds during formation of the limestone beds. Pinnacles with tops similar to mushrooms are created when the calcrete capping is harder than the limestone layer below it. The relatively softer lower layers weather and erode at a faster rate than the top layer leaving behind more material at the top of the pinnacle.

==Fauna and flora==
Nambung National Park is home to a variety of wildlife with 176 observed animal species, including 128 birds, 8 mammals, 15 reptiles, several fish and arthropods and one amphibian. Among the mammal species are the western grey kangaroo, red kangaroo, dingo, honey possum and red fox. Some common bird species include silver gull, black-faced woodswallow, white-backed swallow, red-capped plover and raven. Reptile species include Buchanan&#x27;s snake-eyed skink, yellow-faced whip snake, bobtail (a species of blue-tongued skink) and sand goanna. The only observed amphibian species is the sign-bearing froglet.

Humpback whales visit the Indian Ocean waters adjacent to the park during their northern and southern migration seasons, while sea lions and dolphins are year-round inhabitants.

The park&#x27;s flora includes more than 170 angiosperms with a few examples being coastal wattle, sea nymph, acorn banksia, cowslip orchid, ringed wallaby grass and coast hop-bush. The only recorded gymnosperm is the swamp cypress.

<text>Neerabup National Park is a national park in the City of Wanneroo in Western Australia, situated approximately north of Perth.

The park is found to the west of Wanneroo Road and is a long thin strip of bushland that is about in length. It contains no car parks and roads or any other facilities and attracts no entrance fee.

The area protects part of an ancient Indigenous Australian migration route between Lake Joondalup and Loch McNess (in Yanchep National Park). This later became are well used stock route and then part of the Yaberoo Budjara Heritage Trail. The trail is based on the Yellalonga tribes movements between the lakes and highlights features of historical, aboriginal and natural significance.

The park lies within the Northern Swan Coastal Plain Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance in supporting several thousand Short-billed Black Cockatoos during the non-breeding season.

<text>Peak Charles National Park is a national park in Western Australia, east of Perth and north west of Esperance.

The park is named for one of the main features, Peak Charles, which is an ancient granite peak with an elevation of 
that dominates the park along with its neighbour Peak Eleanora. Both afford excellent views over the park, which is primarily composed of dry sand plain heaths and salt lake systems.

It is located within the IBRA sub region of the Eastern Mallee and has a number of rare plants within its boundaries including &quot;Gastrolobium acrocaroli&quot;.

No entry fee applies to enter the park but there are few facilities available to tourists. A car park, campground and toilets are available.

A looped walk trail to a lookout at the top of Peak Charles is also available which requires rock scrambling.

<doc id="102152" wikidata="Q2104482" url="?curid=102152" title="Porongurup National Park">
<text>Porongurup National Park is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia. It covers , and is southeast of Perth and north of Albany.

The park contains the Porongurup Range, which is the relic core of an ancient mountain range formed in the Precambrian over 1200 million years ago. The Porongurup Range forms part of the Southwest Biodiversity Hotspot, which is one of 34 regions in the world noted for a rich diversity of flora and fauna species. The range contains many peaks and hiking trails, with the highest point being Devils Slide at ,followed by Nancy&#x27;s Peak at 644 metres. Castle Rock (558 metres) is capped with The Granite Skywalk, a steel viewing platform which provides panoramic views of the surrounding karri forest.

==History==
The Porongurup Range is culturally significant to the Mineng and Koreng/Goreng sub-groups of the Noongar people. Minang man Larry Blight states:This is our most sacred site...Porongurup or &quot;Borrongup&quot; means totem in Noongar — a totem could be an animal or a plant that we inherit from our mother’s and father’s side when we are born.The Porongurup Range was first sighted by Europeans passing near Albany in 1802 but farming in the surrounding districts did not start until around 1859 when vegetables were first grown on the southern slopes of the range. The giant karri and jarrah trees of the range were first harvested for timber in the 1880s and timber leases did not begin to be withdrawn until 1925. The National Park was not gazetted officially until 1971, with an area of . This has now been increased to .

== Geomorphology ==
The Porongurup Range is from east to west and consists of porphyritic granite peaks levelled into domes. The range is the remnant of a sizeable reservoir of molten granite that bubbled up when the Antarctic continent struck Australia in the Stenian Period of the Mesoproterozoic Era, around 1200 million (1.2 billion) years ago.

The sea levels of the late Cretaceous were around 100 metres higher than today and during this time the Porongurup Range was an island surrounded by the sea.

== Ecology ==

=== Flora ===
The Porongurup National Park contains over 700 native plant species and at least 300 macrofungi species. At least nine flora species are unique and found only in the park. Examples of plant groups present include: heaths (Epacridaceae), especially beard-heaths (Leucopogon); peas (Fabaceae), notably flame-peas (Chorizema), bitter-peas (Daviesia and Bossiaea) and poison-peas (Gastrolobium); native myrtles (Myrtaceae); pimeleas (Thymelaeaceae), notably rice flowers (Pimelea); sundews and pitcher plants (Nepenthales); bloodroots, conostyles, kangaroo paws and their allies (Haemodorales); and banksias and grevilleas (Proteales). It is also important for richness in lilies, orchids and allies (Liliales), notably native lilies (Anthericaceae), irises and allies (Iridaceae), and orchids (Orchidaceae).

High granite peaks create their own micro-climates due to their altitude and their capacity to attract topographic rainfall. This maintains cooler and moister climate conditions than the surrounding low-lying plains. A remnant island of karri forest prevails here, hundreds of kilometres east of the cool southwest cape where they are more commonly found. They thrive in the granitic soils (known as &quot;karri loam&quot;) and cool, moist air.

On lateritic soils downslope, the predominant type of vegetation is a mixed forest of jarrah and marri, whilst on the highly exposed and frequently waterlogged summits, an open mossy herbland prevails.

=== Fauna ===
The mammal species in the National Park include the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus), brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecular), pygmy possum (Cercartetus concinnus), mardo (or yellow-footed antechinus – Antechinus flavipes leucogaster), mooti (or bush rat – Rattus fuscipes fuscipes), quenda (or southern brown bandicoot – Isoodon obesulus fusciventer) and honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus).

Seventy-one bird species including the red-eared firetail (Emblema oculata) and Baudin&#x27;s black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus baudinii) are also found in the park.

At least 17 reptile species are known to inhabit the park including King&#x27;s skink (Egernia kingii), the southern heath monitor (Varanus rosenbergi) and the marbled gecko (Phyllodactylus marmoratus). Several tree frog and southern frog species are also evident.

Invertebrates present in the National Park include Gondwanan relictual species such as the Porongurup trapdoor spider (Neohomogona bolganupensis), land snails (Bothriembryon spp.) and giant earthworms (Megacolex sp.). Other invertebrates include peacock spiders (Maratus sp), velvet worms (Onychophora) and the social crab spider (Diaea socialis). 

==Climate==
The plains surrounding the Porongurup Range have an annual rainfall of around to the south and around on the northern side. Most of this rain falls between April and October: although light showers are common in the summer months, the average rainfall between November and March totals only around in the southern plains and less than to the north. Summer temperatures on the plains average a very warm in the daytime and decline to around at night. In winter, although it can be rainy, temperatures average a very pleasant during the day and a cool in the morning.

Temperatures on the peaks are around 3 °C (5.4 °F) lower than on the plains, and snow has occasionally fallen on the ranges (heavily in October 1992 and June 1956).

=== Fire and cyclones ===
In 1978, Cyclone Alby felled many trees within the National Park (it was an unusual depression that produced very little rainfall after moving south of the Tropic of Capricorn).

On 11 February 2007, a fire began on private property near the north-west corner of the park. It quickly spread into the native vegetation and raced up the steep slopes within hours. Volunteer fire crews and Department&#x27;s firefighters battled the fast-moving blaze and managed to contain it overnight after it had burnt around 50% of the park. The fire broke containment lines on Monday afternoon (12 February) and spread further through the park and into private property to the north-east. Fire crews, including aerial support from six water bomber planes, continued the battle to contain the blaze and by Tuesday morning it was again under control though still burning freely within the containment zone. Water bombers paid special attention to tourist facilities and special habitats, including an area where endangered noisy scrub birds had been released. By Wednesday morning (14 February) the fire had burnt through around 95% of the national park.

As many of the trees and vegetation are native to the region, it is expected that the park will, to a large extent, recover in the months after the fire. By early April, Kingia australis plants were re-shooting and flowering abundantly in heavily burnt areas but the legacy of the fire will be felt for some time to come. Local populations of kangaroos and other wildlife were injured and local residents assisted in their care and recovery where possible. There has not been such a devastating fire in the region since the 1960s.
==Features==
The park includes a number of significant tourist features and walk trails.

<text>The Purnululu National Park is a World Heritage Site in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia. The national park is located approximately south of Kununurra, with Halls Creek located to the south. Declared a World Heritage Site in 2003, the park was inscribed as follows:


== Purnululu National Park World Heritage Site ==

The World Heritage status of the region was created and negotiated in 2003, and the adopted boundary of the existing national park. Since its listing, the Government of Western Australia has reserved additional areas located adjacent to the World Heritage Area, including the Purnululu Conservation Park and the Ord River Regeneration Reserve. The site was gazetted on the Australian National Heritage List on 21 May 2007 under the .

=== Etymology ===
&quot;Purnululu&quot; is a mispronounced Djaru word for the area around Bungle Bungle out camp, which is referred to as Bullmanlulu. The correct Karjaganujaru name for the Bungle Bungle massif is Billingjal which means sand falling away.

The traditional owners of the area are the Karjaganujaru peoples.

=== Features ===
The Bungle Bungle Range, lying fully within the park, has elevations as high as above sea level. It is famous for the sandstone domes, unusual and visually striking with their striping in alternating orange and grey bands. The banding of the domes is due to differences in clay content and porosity of the sandstone layers: the orange bands consist of oxidised iron compounds in layers that dry out too quickly for cyanobacteria to multiply; the grey bands are composed of cyanobacteria growing on the surface of layers of sandstone where moisture accumulates.

=== Geology ===
The Bungle Bungle Range is one of the most extensive and impressive occurrences of sandstone tower (or cone) karst terrain in the world. The Bungle Bungles were a plateau of Devonian sandstone, carved into a mass of beehive-shaped towers with regularly alternating, dark gray bands of cyanobacterial crust (single cell photosynthetic organisms). The plateau is dissected by deep, sheer-sided gorges and slot canyons. The cone-towers are steep-sided, with an abrupt break of slope at the base and have domed summits. How they were formed is not yet completely understood. Their surface is fragile but stabilized by crusts of iron oxide and bacteria. They provide an outstanding example of land formation by dissolutional weathering of sandstone, with removal of sand grains by wind, rain and sheet wash on slopes.

=== Access ===
Access to the park by road is via Spring Creek Track, from the Great Northern Highway approximately south of Kununurra, to the track&#x27;s end at the visitor centre. The track is long and is usable only in the dry season (about 1 April to 31 December) by four-wheel-drive vehicles. Safely navigating it takes approximately three hours. Access by air is less demanding; helicopter flights are available from Bellburn Airstrip in the national park, and from Warmun roadhouse. Scenic light aircraft flights are also available out of Kununurra and Lake Argyle.

<text>Karlamilyi National Park lies in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, northeast of Newman and north-northeast of Perth. Proclaimed an A Class Reserve on 13 April 1977, it is the largest national park in Western Australia.

The park was initially listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1978 as Rudall River National Park, and was noted as &quot;significant for maintaining ongoing geomorphic and ecological processes within a tropical desert environment. It contains an entire landscape sequence which includes extensive dune fields, table lands, an entire river/creek system, alluvial formations, saline lakes and palaeodrainage lines&quot;. The name of the park was changed in 2008 to Karlamilyi National Park to acknowledge the traditional owners of the area. The park&#x27;s original name was derived from the Rudall River, named by Frank Hann who was one of the first Europeans to explore the area. He named the river after another explorer and surveyor, William Frederick Rudall. 

The area is traditionally Martu country, called &quot;Karlamilyi&quot;. There are two Aboriginal communities within the park: Parnngurr (Cotton Creek) and Punmu (Lake Dora). The park is situated across the boundary between the Little Sandy Desert and the Great Sandy Desert and includes the catchment area of the Rudall River. It is best accessed from the Rudall River Road, which connects the Talawana Track in the south, and the Telfer Mine Road in the north. There are no ranger facilities within the park. Fuel, groceries, emergency medical facilities, camping gear, caravan parking and laundry are available at Parnngurr.

<text>The Serpentine National Park is a national park located on the Darling Scarp, approximately southeast of Perth in Western Australia.

==Features and location==
The national park&#x27;s main feature and most popular tourist destination is the Serpentine Falls, a series of waterfalls in the upper reaches of the Serpentine River. Serpentine falls are located at 32°22′05″S 116°00′40″E. Other attractions include Serpentine Dam and the smaller Pipehead Dam. The park overlaps the North Dandalup Important Bird Area.

The Park was expanded on several occasions to the north of the Serpentine River, including recently in the mid and late 2000s. This included land which was formerly managed by the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale as State Forest and Regional Parks, and land under the management of the Water Corporation. Gooralong Camping and Day Use Area was closed in the mid-2000s in conjunction with this acquisition. The park was proclaimed as a National Park in 1957.

== Flora and fauna ==
In spring the park is abundant with wildflowers. Common species found here include spider orchids, greenhoods and triggerplants. Giant sundew, dryandras and grevilleas are other common species found in this area.

<text>Shannon National Park is a national park on the south coast of Western Australia, south of Perth and southeast of Manjimup. It was declared a national park in 1988. The park covers the entire Shannon River basin. It is part of the larger Walpole Wilderness Area that was established in 2004, an international biodiversity hotspot.

The area contains biologically rich wetlands and heathlands as well as old growth and regrowth karri forests. The area remained largely untouched by logging until the 1940s due to the inaccessibility of the area. A timber mill and the town of Shannon were established in the mid-1940s as a result of a timber shortage during World War II. The town once boasted over 90 homes and a hall, post office, church and nursing station. A dam was built in 1949 to guarantee water supply during the summer months.

The mill eventually closed in 1968 and the houses were sold and moved, leaving the townsite empty and a campground now stands were the town once did. The area was gazetted as a national park in 1988 and is now part of the Walpole Wilderness Area.

The campgrounds contain toilets, gas barbecues, hot water showers and two huts available to campers on a first come first served basis. Entry fees apply for the park.

A unsealed road called the Great Forest Trees Drive was completed in 1996 and provides tourists with the opportunity to view many of the features of the park. There are information stops, picnic areas and walks located along the drive.

<text>Stirling Range National Park is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, approximately south-east of Perth.

There is also an eponymous locality, stretching across the shires of Cranbrook, Gnowangerup and Plantagenet, but the boundaries of the national park and the locality are not identical.

==Description==
It protects the Stirling Ranges, or Koikyennuruff, a range of mountains and hills over wide from west to east, stretching from the highway between Mount Barker and Cranbrook eastward past Gnowangerup. Notable features include Toolbrunup, Bluff Knoll – the tallest peak in the southwestern region – and a silhouette called The Sleeping Princess which is visible from the Porongurup Range. 

Popular recreational activities in the park include bushwalking, abseiling and gliding. Camping is permitted only in Moingup campsite within the park boundaries (fee applies). Other peaks which have tracks include Mt Trio, Talyuberlup Peak and Mt Magog. A premier walk known as The Stirling Ridge Walk is usually done over two days and includes Ellen Peak (the most easterly peak) and Bluff Knoll.

==History==
The traditional owners are the Mineng and Koreng groups of the Noongar peoples who have inhabited the region for tens of thousands of years. The Noongar know the range as &quot;Koi Kyenunu-ruff&quot; which means &quot;mist moving around the mountains&quot;. The area was important to Indigenous Australians with the surrounding lowlands providing many sources of food. The women gathered seeds, roots and fruit while men hunted kangaroos and other animals.

The first European to sight the range was Matthew Flinders in January 1802 while he was exploring the southern coast of Australia. He named the range Mount Rugged.

Ensign Dale explored the area in 1832 and climbed Toolbrunup.

Stirling Range was named by the surveyor John Septimus Roe in 1835 after the Governor of the Swan River Colony, James Stirling, even though Stirling never actually visited the area.

Sandalwood cutters established a track through the park in about 1848. European settlers arrived in the late 1800s initially around Amelup and farmed much of the surrounding areas. John Forrest climbed Toolbrunup in 1881 with Henry Samuel Ranford and made a cairn at the summit.

The boundaries of the park were first suggested by Jas Hope, the Chief Draftsperson of the Lands and Survey Department, in 1908 and approved by Moore who was the Minister of Lands at the time.

The National Park was gazetted in 1913 and the first park ranger was appointed in 1964.

The park was listed as a National Heritage place in 2006.

In 2020, a bushfire caused by lightning devastated 40,000 hectares of park land.

In August 2022, there was a lot of snow in the park.

==Environment==

The area is of great biogeographic and evolutionary interest and displays one of the richest floras in the world. The park provides an important refuge for a large diversity of Australia&#x27;s native plants and animals.

===Flora===
Despite the low soils fertility the area supports over 1,500 different flowering plant species with over 87 of the species found only in the area of the park.

The park is particularly rich in banksias, eucalypts, orchids and verticordias. Ten species of mountain bells (&quot;Darwinia&quot; spp.) have been identified in the park and only one of these is found outside Stirling Range.
Five major vegetation communities are known in the park with thicket and mallee-heath at higher elevations and woodlands, wetlands and salt lake communities on the lower slopes and plains.

===Fauna===

The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of endangered short-billed black cockatoos and western whipbirds, and is visited by endangered long-billed black-cockatoos.

Many native mammals are found in the park including the western pygmy possum and the western grey kangaroo.

Deeper shaded gullies support a range ancient species including land snails, trapdoor spiders and giant earthworms that date back over millions of years.

<text>Stokes National Park is a national park in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia, 538 km south-east of Perth. The National Park is located west of Esperance on the southern coast.

The park was named after Stokes Inlet, which lies within the park and is its best known feature, which was in turn named in 1848 by John Septimus Roe the Surveyor General of Western Australia while leading a five-man exploration expedition along the coast, commemorating John Lort Stokes&#x27; work on surveying the Western Australian coast.

The area of the park is excluding that is part of the historic Moir homestead.

The park covers areas of coastal heath and scrubland, smaller areas of low dense forest and sandy beaches around the inlet and coast to the south of the park.

The National Park is on a relinquished pastoral lease, originally known as Fanny Cove Station, which in 1951 became Young River Station. It was then reverted to crown land and national park status by 1973. The Moir homestead ruins from the 1873 establishment at Fanny Cove were on a heritage list by 1993, but have since been destroyed by fire.

<text>Tathra National Park is a national park in Western Australia, located north of Perth between the towns of Eneabba and Carnamah on Winchester-Eneabba Road. The name is derived from a Noongar word meaning &quot;beautiful place&quot;.

==Description==
The park is set in sandplain country and is surrounded by farmland, having escaped clearing by wheat farmers in the early 20th century. Shallow valleys with sandy floors change to laterite on the slopes and hilltops, and the low heath changes in composition accordingly. The park is considered a representative sample of flora of the area, although includes some unusual plants - including a species of &quot;Daviesia&quot; notable for its large red flowers, which is known only from the reserve, and shaggy dryandra (&quot;Banksia splendida&quot;), which is common on some lateritic rises. Public usage of the park was mainly for wildflower observation in winter and spring according to a 1974 report, whose recommendation (which was not followed) would have seen it demoted to a flora and fauna conservation reserve.

==History==
Land for the national park was set aside by the Department of Lands and Surveys under Reserves ↑26802 and ↑26805 on 23 May 1969, and over 1970 and 1971, the land was classified as an &quot;A&quot; Class reserve, meaning its purpose could not be changed except by an Act of Parliament, and was vested in the National Parks Authority of Western Australia. The park was officially named on 8 October 1971.

<doc id="102165" wikidata="Q1126874" url="?curid=102165" title="Torndirrup National Park">
<text>Torndirrup National Park is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, southeast of Perth and via Frenchman Bay Road is south of Albany.

Torndirrup National Park has many impressive rock formations on the coast. These include the Gap, Natural Bridge and the Blowholes all shaped from the local granite. The park is along the coast on the west side of King George Sound and consists of a range of cliffs, gullies, blowholes, beaches and promontories.

==History==

The area is composed of three major rock types, one of these being gneiss. The oldest of these was formed 1300-1600 million years ago. This rock type can be seen along the cliff walls of the Gap. The granites were formed later as the Australian Plate collided with the Antarctic Plate 1160 million years ago as molten rock rose to the surface. These granites are visible in the tors atop Stony Hill.

The park was gazetted in 1918, one of the first in Western Australia. It was later named in 1969 taking the name of the Indigenous Australian clan that lived in the area. The first ranger was appointed in 1973.
The park is the most often visited park in Western Australia, with approximately 250,000 visitors per annum.

A large bushfire burnt through of bushland in the area in 2010 and caused the closure of Frenchman Bay Road isolating tourists and residents of the area. In 2015 another fire burnt out of bushland between Stony Hill and the Blowholes including destroying important populations of the critically endangered Banksia verticillata.

==Flora and fauna==

A large array of floral species can be found within the park, including the woolly-bush, peppermint tree, swamp yate, various banksias and karri forest. Coastal plants such as native rosemary, banjine and thick leafed fanflower are found in the heath. The park is also home to the very rare Albany woolly-bush and the critically endangered blue tinsel lily of which only a single population exists.

Fauna such as kangaroos, bush rats, pygmy possums and short-nosed bandicoots are found within the park. Many reptile species are also to be found, including tiger snakes, bardick, Children&#x27;s python and dugites. In 1876 the rare dibbler was found in the park.
Birdlife includes honeyeaters, wattlebirds, button quail, western rosella and a variety of seabirds.
Whales and seals can be seen from the cliffs of the park in the correct season.

The rare and ancient Main&#x27;s assassin spider, currently listed as threatened, was found to inhabit the park during a survey conducted in 2008.

==Facilities==

There is an entry fee to access the park. Access to the park is via Frenchman Bay Road, which is sealed and well sign-posted. Access to most features is via sealed roads. No other facilities exist within the park but barbecues, tables, shops and toilets can be found nearby at Frenchman Bay. Entry fees are required to visit the Gap and Natural Bridge.

The park has numerous walks, mostly of a distance of less than , including the Jimmy Newhills walk and the Stony Hill Heritage Trail walk. The longest trail is the Bald Head Walk along Flinders peninsula finishing at Bald Head at the eastern edge of the park.

A 6.1 million upgrade of facilities at the Gap and the Natural Bridge opened in 2016. The redevelopment included two universally accessible lookout structures, connecting paths, a picnic area, interpretive signage and a car park. A cantilevered grated see-through platform at the Gap rises almost above the Southern Ocean (also known as Antarctic Ocean) and extends out from the cliff face, of which is directly above the ocean.

<text>Tuart Forest National Park is a national park in the South West region of Western Australia, south of Perth. It contains the largest remaining section of pure tuart forest in the world. Traditionally the state forest associated with this stand of trees has been known as the &quot;Ludlow State Forest&quot;, named for Frederick Ludlow.

This narrow strip of tuart trees is situated near Ludlow between Capel and Busselton. The trees, species &quot;Eucalyptus gomphocephala&quot;, only grow on the coastal limestone that underlies the area and the park is home to the tallest and largest specimens of the trees remaining on the Swan Coastal Plain. The taller specimens found in the park are over tall and over in girth.

Tuart Drive, which is about in length and was part of Bussell Highway before the opening of the Ludlow diversion in 1995, goes through the national park.

In addition to the pure tuart forest, the park is also home to the largest remaining wild population of the Western Ringtail Possum. Both the Western Ringtail Possums and the Brushtail Possums can be found along the Possum Spotlighting Trail within the park, which is designed to be walked at night, when both types of possums (being nocturnal) are most active. The trail is about long and there are reflective markers installed along narrower parts of the trail. It is accessible via a carpark along Layman Road.

<text>Tunnel Creek National Park is a national park in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, northeast of Perth and east of Broome. The natural cave through which Tunnel Creek flows is a major attraction of the park.

Many Aboriginal rock paintings and speleothems are present in the cave decorating the walls. The cave was the hideout of the Aboriginal warrior Jandamarra, who was killed outside the entrance of the cave in 1897. It is part of the Balili (Devonian Reef) Conservation Park.

==Geography==
The park is located in the Napier Range and covers an area of . The range is composed of limestone and is the remains of a Devonian reef system formed around 350 million years ago.

The tunnel component of Tunnel Creek has a length of approximately that runs underground and is one of the oldest cave systems in Western Australia. The reef was first exposed around 250 million years ago and the first cave systems began to form; the present cave systems were created about 20 million years ago.

The cave reaches a maximum height of and has a maximum width of . The creek was once known as &quot;The Cave of the Bats&quot;, with at least five species of bat inhabiting the cavern. There are large pools of water on the floor of the cave in which freshwater crocodiles have been found. The pools indicate that the water table is only just below the present floor surface and water only flows through the area after heavy rainfall.

<doc id="102168" wikidata="Q1810964" url="?curid=102168" title="Walpole-Nornalup National Park">
<text>Walpole-Nornalup National Park is a national park in the South West region of Western Australia, south of Perth. It is famous for its towering karri and tingle trees. Red tingle trees are unique to the Walpole area.
The park is part of the larger Walpole Wilderness Area that was established in 2004, an international biodiversity hotspot.

==History==
The traditional owners of the area are the Murrum of the Minang peoples of the larger Noongar group who have inhabited the region for over 30,000 years.

The park is named after the nearby town of Walpole which in turn honours William Walpole, who served alongside James Stirling on HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; in 1809. The Noongar peoples know the area as Nor-Nor-Nup, meaning the place of the black snake, which was anglicised as Nornalup.

The explorer William Nairne Clark visited the area in 1841 and sailed up the Frankland River. The botanist and explorer Ferdinand von Mueller explored the area in 1877.T he Bellanger family were the first European settlers to arrive in the area in 1910, settling alongside the Frankland River and building a homestead in 1914.
The park was first declared in 1910 when James Mitchell the Minister of Lands and Agriculture visited the area and was so impressed with the beauty that he set aside for conservation as an A-class reserve. Another portion west of the Irwin Inlet was declared as a reserve in 1912 and later absorbed into the park.

The park received 158,167 visitors through 2008–2009.

==Tourism==
The Valley of the Giants is one of the main tourist draws in the area. Those with a head for heights can get a tree top view on the Tree Top Walk a high walk way that can accommodate wheelchairs. Most similar canopy walks around the world are constructed using suspension bridge-type structures — not for the faint of heart. The Tree Top Walk, however, is a series of sixty-metre, lightweight steel trusses built on steel pylons to form a secure ramp. Beneath the canopy walk there is a pathway around the tingle trees for walkers — this is known as the &quot;Ancient Empire&quot;. A whale watching vantage point is settled at Conspicuous Beach, providing views of migrating whales (humpback and southern right) and dolphins.

==Environment==
The tingle tree has evolved to cope with bush fires and can withstand low level fires. The Department of Parks and Wildlife carries out fuel reduction backburning in the national park; this limits the risk of a large scale bush fire by reducing the amount of dry leaf litter on the ground. Tingles can look completely burned in the inside but continue to survive as they grow from just under the layer of outside bark.

The park also extends to the coast, providing a range of habitats from forest to coastal heathland featuring swamp paperbark and a red flowering gum which is endemic to the region. Conspicuous Cliff is one of the few places the coast is accessible in the national park. The area also the Walpole-Nornalup Inlets, which are fed by the Deep and Frankland rivers.

The Bibbulmun Track winds through the park to the coast.

<text>Walyunga National Park is a national park in Western Australia, 35 km northeast of Perth along the Great Northern Highway.

There is also an eponymous locality of the City of Swan, but the boundaries of the national park and the locality are not identical.

==Description==
The park is situated just behind the Darling Scarp in the Darling Range spread over a steeply sided valley. The Swan-Avon River and the Eastern Railway run through the park and the Avon Descent passes through a set of rapids along this section. The area is dominated by granite outcrops along with smaller dolerite areas, the tops of hills are capped with laterite.

The park has barbeque, parking and toilet facilities. Also it is home to many animals such as grey kangaroo, galah, goanna, magpie, gecko and many other wildlife species. Plants include flooded gum, jarrah, petrophile and hakea. Walyunga is a 6000 year old meeting place used by the Noongar people. Currently it is an official protected area.

The word &quot;Walyunga&quot; roughly translates to &quot;Happy Place&quot;.

<text>Warren National Park is a national park in the South West region of Western Australia, south of Perth and south of Pemberton.

The park is dominated by old growth karri trees, some of which are almost in height. Some of these trees were used to act as fire lookout towers built during the 1930s and 1940s. The Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree is situated within the park and was pegged in 1988 as part of Australia&#x27;s bicentennial celebrations. This is one of three trees found around Pemberton that tourists are able to climb.

The Warren River flows through the park along with many smaller creeks and gullies. The river is plentiful in trout and marron, which can be caught in season.

<doc id="102171" wikidata="Q1342385" url="?curid=102171" title="Watheroo National Park">
<text>Watheroo National Park is a national park in Western Australia, 187 km north of Perth. It contains Jingemia Cave.

The park is situated in the Mid West region of Western Australia to the west of the Midlands Road between the towns of Badgingarra to the west and Dalwallinu to the east. The border of the park abuts Pinjarrega Nature Reserve to the north but is otherwise surrounded by farmland. Low Creek borders the park to the east, and then flows south to join Moore River.

The park is mostly composed of sand plain country, which supports populations of heath, mallee and Banksia and many wildflowers. Eucalypt stands can be found to the western end of the park. Other species include spinifex, wandoo and yorm gum. Some of the wildflowers found within the park include kwongan, bush cauliflower and scarlet featherflower.

The name of the park comes from the Indigenous Australian name of a nearby spring; it is also the name of a town located to the east of the park.

Composed mostly of quartz-based sand with outcrops of sandstone at times having a laterite cap, the area acts as a basin between the Dandaragan plateau and the Darling plateau.

In 2010, the Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia gave approval to survey the Warro gas field that is located beneath the park. The company Latent Petroleum was given permission to conduct a seismic survey, allowing them to drive over vegetation.

<text>Waychinicup National Park is in Western Australia, southeast of Perth and east of Albany, along the coast of the Southern Ocean.

==Location and description==
The park is bordered by the Southern Ocean to the south, Mount Manypeaks Nature Reserve to the east, and agricultural land to the north. Its coastline runs between Normans Beach and Cheynes Beach, near Bremer Bay. 

The park offers and array of landscapes, from the rugged coast to boulder-strewn hilltops. Tree-filled, deeply-incised valleys have freshwater streams flowing through them, with moss-covered boulders. Facilities provided include a camping area and bush toilet near the inlet of the Waychinicup River.

Bald Island Nature Reserve is located offshore nearby.

== Fauna ==

===Mammals===
The park is home to some of the rarest animals in Australia. Species found in the park include the quenda, ring tailed possums and one of the few mainland populations of quokkas.

Southern right whales inhabit the ocean off the coast.

In 2010, an insurance population of Gilbert&#x27;s potoroo was established within an enclosure at the park, as a short-term measure, but it was found in 2015 that native carpet pythons were getting into the enclosure and preying on the marsupials. As of December 2018 there were 20 of the critically endangered marsupials in the park, representing a fifth of the total remaining population in the world. 

===Birds===
The park forms part of the Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its significance in the conservation of several rare and threatened bird species. The critically endangered noisy scrubbird, which was once thought to be extinct, is found within the park; a small population of 14 were translocated from Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve in 1983, followed by another 16 in 1985. By 1994 it was estimated that 223 male birds had been heard singing in the area.

The western bristlebird is another vulnerable species that is found within the park. Most of the birds remaining population is found in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Waychinicup National Park. Populations of the bird that have been on the decline since the late 19th century has started to stabilise.

<text>West Cape Howe National Park is a national park in Western Australia, southeast of Perth. The park is found between Albany and Denmark within the City of Albany and in the Great Southern region.

Torbay Head, the most southerly point of the mainland of Western Australia, is situated within the park.
The park is abutted against the coast of the Southern Ocean and takes up approximately of the coastline between Lowlands Beach and Forsythe Bluff.

== History ==

The park began as being vested in the Shire of Albany in 1977 for the purposes of recreation. By 1985 the area was gazetted as C Class Reserve after agreement between the shire and vested in the National Parks and Nature Conservancy Authority. Following the addition of an extra that was a timber reserve along the northern boundary the park was given an A Class status in 1987. The park is now a single reserve (26177) and is made up of an area of .
The rare and ancient Main&#x27;s assassin spider, currently listed as threatened, was found to inhabit the park during a survey conducted in 2008.

== Flora ==

The park is home to a range of habitats including karri forest, coastal heath and wetlands each of which support a diverse array of vegetation and plant species. The area around Lake William supports a dense sedge scrub and rare species such as &quot;Amperea volubilus&quot; and an unnamed species of &quot;Melaleuca&quot;. The Albany Pitcher Plant, &quot;Cephalotus follicularis&quot;, is also found in the park.

==Facilities==

Due to the sandy nature of many of the tracks, much of the park is accessible only to four-wheel drive vehicles, although all vehicles may reach the popular Shelley Beach where a campground is located. Shelley Beach also has a look-out, toilet and barbecue launching facilities for hang-gliders. The nearby Golden Gate Beach is also a popular location for surfers.

Western Australia&#x27;s long-distance walking trail, the Bibbulmun Track passes through the park. The park has many facilities for bushwalkers, with a return trip spur-trail from the track to Torbay Head and a boardwalk section of the track. In the West of the park, there is an overnight shelter for walkers that sleeps 12-15 persons, named &quot;West Cape Howe Campsite&quot;.

<doc id="102174" wikidata="Q21491677" url="?curid=102174" title="Van Eyck">
<text>Van Eyck or Van Eijk () is a Dutch toponymic surname. &quot;Eijck&quot;, &quot;Eyck&quot;, &quot;Eyk&quot; and &quot;Eijk&quot; are all archaic spellings of modern Dutch (&quot;oak&quot;) and the surname literally translates as &quot;from/of oak&quot;. However, in most cases, the family name refers to an origin in Maaseik. This city on the Meuse, now in Belgium on the border with the Netherlands, was originally simply known as &quot;Eike&quot; (with many spellings) and from the 13th century as Old Eyck and New Eyck. Names with an affix (tussenvoegsel), like &quot;Van der Eijk&quot;, are more likely to refer directly to the tree. This article lists people with this surname.

==Renaissance family of painters==

The important Flemish family of Early Netherlandish painters with the surname van Eyck originated in Maaseik, but ultimately established their professional domicile in Ghent and in Bruges. There they changed the traditional habits of the earlier schools, remodeled the earlier forms of Flemish design, and introduced a substantial revolution into the technical methods of execution familiar to their countrymen. These painters were responsible for many famous works of the 15th century.

Family members included: Hubert van Eyck (1380s – 1426), Jan van Eyck (c.1390 – 1441), their brother Lambert van Eyck, and sister Margareta van Eyck, Jan&#x27;s wife, also Margaretha (1405/06 – aft.1441), and probably Barthélemy d&#x27;Eyck (c.1420 – aft.1470) from the next generation. Jan van Eyck, active in Bruges, is probably the best known Northern European painter of the 15th century.

<text>William Bay National Park is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, southeast of Perth and between the towns of Denmark and Walpole.

==Description==
Situated approximately west of Denmark, William Bay National Park covers and includes Greens Pool and Elephant Rocks. The granite boulders create a natural reef which protects Greens Pool from the Great Southern Ocean, and a safe swimming beach for children who are under supervision. William Bay National Park is located along the south coast of Western Australia along the Rainbow Coast, and is in the Shire of Denmark.

<text>Windjana Gorge National Park is a national park in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, 1855 km northeast of Perth and 355 km east of Broome. It is open during the dry season only, usually April to November (dates vary according to conditions).

The gorge has been carved by the Lennard River and is over 3 km long and about 100 m wide with walls to a height of 30 m in places. The rocks are part of the Napier Range, an ancient Devonian reef system that is over 375 million years old.
The rocks are the same as the ones found at Tunnel Creek and Geikie Gorge.

The river flows freely through the gorge during the wet season but during the dry season (between May and September) it becomes a series of pools surrounded by trees and shrubs. Some of the vegetation found along the river banks include paperbarks, cadjebuts, native fig trees and leichhardt trees.

It is part of the Balili (Devonian Reef) Conservation Park.

<text>Yalgorup National Park is a national park in Western Australia, 105 km south of Perth, and directly south of Mandurah.

The park is located on the western edge of the Swan Coastal Plain and contains a chain of about ten lakes; the name rises from the two Noongar words &quot;Yalgor&quot; meaning &quot;lake&quot; and &quot;-up&quot; meaning &quot;place of&quot;.

The area is part of the Peel-Yalgorup Wetland system, which is classified as a Ramsar Wetland Site and was added to the List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance in 1990. Some of the lakes that make up the system include Boundary Lake, Swan Pond, Lake Pollard, Lake Yalgorup and Newnham Lake.

==Wildlife==
The wetlands of the park have been identified by BirdLife International as the Yalgorup Important Bird Area because of their importance for waterbirds. Lake Clifton and Lake Preston are both situated within the boundaries of the park and are home to a large variety of bird-life. Black swans, kingfishers, grebes, coots, waterfowl and a variety of parrots and a variety of dotterels can be found in and around the lake habitat.

Woodlands and tuart forests are also found within the park, and contain fauna including western grey kangaroos, emus, brush wallabies, brush-tailed possums, echidna and bandicoots. The quokka was also once found within the area but have been wiped out by foxes.

<doc id="102180" wikidata="Q932964" url="?curid=102180" title="Yanchep National Park">
<text>Yanchep is a national park in Western Australia, north of Perth adjacent to the locality of the same name Yanchep.

The park is noted for its caves, native bush and koala colonies. It also offers cultural educational programmes offered in partnership with the local Nyoongar people.

==History==
The area was inhabited and was a noted hunting site for thousands of years by Indigenous Australians prior to the arrival of Europeans. The tribal name for the park is &quot;Nyanyi-Yandjip&quot; named after the reeds and lake which were thought to resemble the hairy mane of the dreamtime creature the Waugul.

The word Yanchep is derived from &quot;Yandjip&quot; or &quot;Yanget&quot; which is the aboriginal name for the local bulrush reed found fringing the lakes in the area.

The first European visitor arrived in 1834 when John Butler, a farmer, came in search of his lost cattle and noted the presence of the lakes, wetlands and plentiful game. While in the area Butler was greeted by the men of the &quot;Yellagonga&quot; peoples who inhabited the area.
Lieutenant George Grey travelled through the area in 1838 and made note of the remarkable caves he found in the area.

Surveyor John Septimus Roe and Governor John Hutt visited the caves in the park in 1841.

A road survey was conducted near Loch McNess in 1862 and later in 1865 a stock route was built through the area that was later used by drovers.

The first settler to arrive in the area was Henry White who arrived in 1901 and built his house near the north west shore of Yonderup Lake, he was later appointed as a caretaker and guide in 1903.

==Flora and fauna==
The park is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. Trees such as banksias, paperbark, tuart, marri, she-oak and stunted jarrah are found in the woodland areas. Wildflowers including parrot bush, yanchep rose, catspaw and kangaroo paw are also found.

The park provides habitat for several species of native mammal, including the quenda, western grey kangaroo and black-glove wallaby. It lies within the Northern Swan Coastal Plain Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance in supporting several thousand short-billed black cockatoos during the non-breeding season.

== Activities ==
Yanchep National Park is open year-round and offers a variety of nature-based activities for visitors. For visitors there is an entry-fee for all vehicles entering the national park that must be paid.

=== Walking trails ===
Yanchep National Park has nine marked trail walks that cater for different abilities and levels. Walks range from family-friendly short trails of 500m to challenging trails up to 46.2 km. Each trail showcases the unique biodiversity of the northern Swan Coastal Plain.

=== Wangi Mia Aboriginal Experience ===
The Wangi Mia Aboriginal Experience is available as a public tour on Sunday and public holidays. Wangi Mia offers opportunities to explore more about the local Noongar culture.

=== Koala Boardwalk ===
Yanchep National Park is home to a colony of Koalas. These can be viewed on the 140-metre-long Koala Park that allows close-up views of the koalas. There are also daily talks providing more information about koalas and their habitat.

=== Picnic and barbecue areas ===
Yanchep National Park has many picnic and barbeque areas. There are gas barbeques available free of charge along with wooden tables and benches.

=== Trees Adventure Yanchep Park ===
The Trees Adventure Park has seven adventure courses suitable for different abilities. Each course consists of rope and zipline challenges. The adventure park is suitable for children aged 4+.

=== Restaurant and tea rooms ===
Chocolate Drops Tea Rooms is located next to the visitor&#x27;s centre and serves simple homemade food, including sandwiches, muffins and homemade chocolate. The Yanchep Inn is a fully licensed restaurant open 7 days a week and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.

== Caves ==
Yanchep National Park contains over 570 caves. They were formed by underground streams flowing westward from the Gnangara Mound through Tamala Limestone. Currently, Crystal Cave, Yonderup Cave, and Cabaret Cave are the only caves currently open to the public, although in the past, additional caves have been made accessible to visitors.
=== Crystal Cave ===
Crystal Cave was discovered by Henry White in 1903 and is the only tourist cave in Perth. Crystal Cave can be visited on guided tours departing four times daily from the Visitors Center.

=== Yonderup Cave ===
Yonderup Cave was discovered in 1903 by L. Ramaciotti, C. Conigeave and H. Kent. Unlike Crystal Cave (a tourist cave), Yonderup Cave is classified as an adventure cave, where visitors are guided through the relatively untouched environment with a hard hat and a headtorch. Tours must be prebooked online.

=== Cabaret Cave ===
Cabaret Cave, initially called Milligan&#x27;s Cave (later renamed Ballroom Cave and later still Silver Stocking Cabaret Cave) was discovered by Henry White in 1902. In 1932, it was developed into an underground function centre where the cave&#x27;s two main chambers were converted into a supper room and a ballroom. Currently, the cave is available for hire for function and events, accommodating between 120-200 guests.

<doc id="102181" wikidata="Q215121" url="?curid=102181" title="Presentation layer">
<text>In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the presentation layer is layer 6 and serves as the data translator for the network. It is sometimes called the syntax layer.

==Description==
Within the service layering semantics of the OSI network architecture, the presentation layer responds to service requests from the application layer and issues service requests to the session layer through a unique presentation service access point (PSAP).

The presentation layer ensures the information that the application layer of one system sends out is readable by the application layer of another system. On the sending system it is responsible for conversion to standard, transmittable formats. On the receiving system it is responsible for the translation, formatting, and delivery of information for processing or display. In theory, it relieves application layer protocols of concern regarding syntactical differences in data representation within the end-user systems. An example of a presentation service would be the conversion of an extended binary coded decimal interchange code (EBCDIC-coded) text computer file to an ASCII-coded file. If necessary, the presentation layer might be able to translate between multiple data formats using a common format.

In many widely used applications and protocols no distinction is actually made between the presentation and application layers. For example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), generally regarded as an application-layer protocol, has presentation-layer aspects such as the ability to identify character encoding for proper conversion, which is then done in the application layer.

The presentation layer is the lowest layer at which application programmers consider data structure and presentation, instead of simply sending data in the form of datagrams or packets between hosts. This layer deals with issues of string representation - whether they use the Pascal method (an integer length field followed by the specified amount of bytes) or the C/C++ method (null-terminated strings, e.g. codice_1). The idea is that the application layer should be able to point at the data to be moved, and the presentation layer will translate this to commands able to be understood by other applications and processes.

Serialization of complex data structures into flat byte-strings (using mechanisms such as TLV, XML or JSON) can be thought of as the key functionality of the presentation layer. Structure representation is normally standardized at this level, often by using XML or JSON. As well as simple pieces of data, like strings, more complicated things are standardized in this layer. Two common examples are &#x27;objects&#x27; in object-oriented programming, and the exact way that streaming video is transmitted.

Encryption and Decryption are typically done at this level too, although it can be done on the application, session, transport, or network layers, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, when logging on to bank account sites the presentation layer will decrypt the data as it is received.

==Services==
*Data conversion
*Character code translation
*Compression
*Encryption and Decryption
*Serialization

==Protocols==
Protocols sometimes considered at this level (though perhaps not strictly adhering to the OSI model) include:
* Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)
* Independent Computing Architecture (ICA), the Citrix system core protocol
* Lightweight Presentation Protocol (LPP)
* NetWare Core Protocol (NCP)
* Network Data Representation (NDR)
* Tox, The Tox protocol is sometimes regarded as part of both the presentation and application layer
* eXternal Data Representation (XDR)
* X.25 Packet Assembler/Disassembler Protocol (PAD)

<text>Celestial mechanics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the motions of objects in outer space. Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of physics (classical mechanics) to astronomical objects, such as stars and planets, to produce ephemeris data.

==History==
Modern analytic celestial mechanics started with Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; (1687). The name celestial mechanics is more recent than that. Newton wrote that the field should be called &quot;rational mechanics&quot;. The term &quot;dynamics&quot; came in a little later with Gottfried Leibniz, and over a century after Newton, Pierre-Simon Laplace introduced the term &quot;celestial mechanics&quot;. Prior to Kepler, there was little connection between exact, quantitative prediction of planetary positions, using geometrical or numerical techniques, and contemporary discussions of the physical causes of the planets&#x27; motion.

===Laws of planetary motion===
Johannes Kepler as the first to closely integrate the predictive geometrical astronomy, which had been dominant from Ptolemy in the 2nd century to Copernicus, with physical concepts to produce a &quot;New Astronomy, Based upon Causes, or Celestial Physics&quot; in 1609. His work led to the laws of planetary orbits, which he developed using his physical principles and the planetary observations made by Tycho Brahe. Kepler&#x27;s elliptical model greatly improved the accuracy of predictions of planetary motion, years before Newton developed his law of gravitation in 1686.

===Newtonian mechanics and universal gravitation===
Isaac Newton is credited with introducing the idea that the motion of objects in the heavens, such as planets, the Sun, and the Moon, and the motion of objects on the ground, like cannon balls and falling apples, could be described by the same set of physical laws. In this sense he unified &quot;celestial&quot; and &quot;terrestrial&quot; dynamics. Using his law of gravity, Newton confirmed Kepler&#x27;s laws for elliptical orbits by deriving them from the gravitational two-body problem, which Newton included in his epochal &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; in 1687.

===Three-body problem===

After Newton, Joseph-Louis Lagrange attempted to solve the three-body problem in 1772, analyzed the stability of planetary orbits, and discovered the existence of the Lagrange points. Lagrange also reformulated the principles of classical mechanics, emphasizing energy more than force, and developing a method to use a single polar coordinate equation to describe any orbit, even those that are parabolic and hyperbolic. This is useful for calculating the behaviour of planets and comets and such (parabolic and hyperbolic orbits are conic section extensions of Kepler&#x27;s elliptical orbits). More recently, it has also become useful to calculate spacecraft trajectories.

Henri Poincaré published two now classical monographs, &quot;New Methods of Celestial Mechanics&quot; (1892–1899) and &quot;Lectures on Celestial Mechanics&quot; (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). Poincaré showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.

These monographs include an idea of Poincaré, which later became the basis for mathematical &quot;chaos theory&quot; (see, in particular, the Poincaré recurrence theorem) and the general theory of dynamical systems. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).

===Standardisation of astronomical tables===
Simon Newcomb was a Canadian-American astronomer who revised Peter Andreas Hansen&#x27;s table of lunar positions. In 1877, assisted by George William Hill, he recalculated all the major astronomical constants. After 1884 he conceived, with A.M.W. Downing, a plan to resolve much international confusion on the subject. By the time he attended a standardisation conference in Paris, France, in May 1886, the international consensus was that all ephemerides should be based on Newcomb&#x27;s calculations. A further conference as late as 1950 confirmed Newcomb&#x27;s constants as the international standard.
===Anomalous precession of Mercury===
Albert Einstein explained the anomalous precession of Mercury&#x27;s perihelion in his 1916 paper &quot;The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity&quot;. General relativity led astronomers to recognize that Newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy.

==Examples of problems==
Celestial motion, without additional forces such as drag forces or the thrust of a rocket, is governed by the reciprocal gravitational acceleration between masses. A generalization is the &quot;n&quot;-body problem, where a number &quot;n&quot; of masses are mutually interacting via the gravitational force. Although analytically not integrable in the general case, the integration can be well approximated numerically.

:Examples:
:*4-body problem: spaceflight to Mars (for parts of the flight the influence of one or two bodies is very small, so that there we have a 2- or 3-body problem; see also the patched conic approximation)
:*3-body problem:
:**Quasi-satellite
:**Spaceflight to, and stay at a Lagrangian point

In the formula_1 case (two-body problem) the configuration is much simpler than for formula_2. In this case, the system is fully integrable and exact solutions can be found.

:Examples:
:*A binary star, e.g., Alpha Centauri (approx. the same mass)
:*A binary asteroid, e.g., 90 Antiope (approx. the same mass)

A further simplification is based on the &quot;standard assumptions in astrodynamics&quot;, which include that one body, the orbiting body, is much smaller than the other, the central body. This is also often approximately valid.

:Examples:
:*The Solar System orbiting the center of the Milky Way
:*A planet orbiting the Sun
:*A moon orbiting a planet
:*A spacecraft orbiting Earth, a moon, or a planet (in the latter cases the approximation only applies after arrival at that orbit)

==Perturbation theory==

Perturbation theory comprises mathematical methods that are used to find an approximate solution to a problem which cannot be solved exactly. (It is closely related to methods used in numerical analysis, which are ancient.) The earliest use of modern perturbation theory was to deal with the otherwise unsolvable mathematical problems of celestial mechanics: Newton&#x27;s solution for the orbit of the Moon, which moves noticeably differently from a simple Keplerian ellipse because of the competing gravitation of the Earth and the Sun.

Perturbation methods start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is carefully chosen to be exactly solvable. In celestial mechanics, this is usually a Keplerian ellipse, which is correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the Earth and the Moon), or a circular orbit, which is only correct in special cases of two-body motion, but is often close enough for practical use.

The solved, but simplified problem is then &quot;perturbed&quot; to make its time-rate-of-change equations for the object&#x27;s position closer to the values from the real problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third, more distant body (the Sun). The slight changes that result from the terms in the equations – which themselves may have been simplified yet again – are used as corrections to the original solution. Because simplifications are made at every step, the corrections are never perfect, but even one cycle of corrections often provides a remarkably better approximate solution to the real problem.

There is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, for most problems the recycling and refining of prior solutions to obtain a new generation of better solutions could continue indefinitely, to any desired finite degree of accuracy.

The common difficulty with the method is that the corrections usually progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. Newton is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the Moon&#x27;s orbit &quot;It causeth my head to ache.&quot;

This general procedure – starting with a simplified problem and gradually adding corrections that make the starting point of the corrected problem closer to the real situation – is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering. It is the natural extension of the &quot;guess, check, and fix&quot; method used anciently with numbers.

==Reference frame==

Problems in celestial mechanics are often posed in simplifying reference frames, such as the synodic reference frame applied to the three-body problem, where the origin coincides with the barycenter of the two larger celestial bodies. Other reference frames for n-body simulations include those that place the origin to follow the center of mass of a body, such as the heliocentric and the geocentric reference frames. The choice of reference frame gives rise to many phenomena, including the retrograde motion of superior planets while on a geocentric reference frame.

<text>Clara Hughes (born September 27, 1972) is a Canadian cyclist and speed skater who has won multiple Olympic medals in both sports. Hughes won two bronze in the 1996 Summer Olympics and four medals (one gold, one silver, two bronze) over the course of three Winter Olympics.

Hughes is one of the few athletes who have competed in both the Summer and Winter Olympic games. Hughes is one of only six people to have podium finishes in the Winter and Summer versions of the Games, and is the only person ever to have won multiple medals in both. Hughes was the first Canadian woman to win a medal in road cycling at the Olympics, winning two in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

As a result of her success in multiple sports and her humanitarian efforts, Hughes was named to both the Order of Manitoba and as an Officer of the Order of Canada. She is involved with Right To Play, which is an athlete-driven international humanitarian organization that uses sports to encourage the development of youth in disadvantaged areas. After winning her gold medal in 2006, she donated $10,000 to Right to Play.

Throughout her career Hughes received a number of other awards, trophies, and accolades. She was named Female Athlete of the Year by Speed Skating Canada in 2004 for long track. In 2006, she received the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s Sport and Community Trophy. She was then named to the 2006 List of Most Influential Women in Sport and Physical Activity by the Canadian Association for Advancement of Women and Sport (CAAWS). In the summer of the year 2010, it was announced that she would receive a star on the Canadian Walk of Fame and on November 15, 2010, she was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Hughes was born in Winnipeg, and is a graduate of Elmwood High School. In an interview on CBC Radio show &quot;Definitely Not the Opera&quot;, Hughes reveals that as a youth, she smoked cigarettes, drank a lot at a young age and did a lot of drugs, admitting she did not envision herself as an athlete. She was inspired to begin skating after witnessing Gaétan Boucher at the 1988 Winter Olympics. She started with speed skating, but in 1990 she moved to competitive cycling, competing in track cycling and road cycling.

Hughes started speed skating at the age of 16, and then took up the sport of cycling at the age of 17. She would eventually return to the sport of speed skating at the age of 28, after achieving success in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. With her experience and endurance earned through cycling, Hughes went on to a successful career competing in the 3,000 m and 5,000 m. This would eventually lead her to medal in these long-distance events at the Winter Olympics. She then returned to cycling, at the age of 38, to later successfully return for the 2012 London Olympics.

===Cycling===

Hughes, an 18-time Canadian national cycling champion, won the silver medal at the 1995 World Cycling Championships (time trial).

She participated at the 1991, 1995, 1999 and 2003 Pan American Games and won eight Pan American Games medals. A participant at the 1990, 1994 and 2002 Commonwealth Games, Hughes won gold in the time trial (road, 2002), bronze in the points race on the velodrome (2002), and silver in the 50 km team time trial (1994, with Alison Sydor, Anne Samplonius, and Lesley Tomlinson).

Hughes participated in the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics, winning two bronze medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, in the individual road race and the individual time trial. These were the second and the third ever medals in road cycling for Canada, after Steve Bauer&#x27;s silver medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics, and the first medals in cycling for a Canadian woman. As of 2011, these were the only three cycling medals for Canada.

A four-time participant of the women&#x27;s Tour de France, Hughes has won the 1994 Women&#x27;s Challenge and the 1995 Liberty Classic.

Hughes served as a commentator for cycling events for the CBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

In November 2010, she announced a comeback, indicating her desire to race at the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the 2011 Pan American Championships, Hughes won the individual time trial and road race, both by a big margin. In May 2011, she took first in the Tour of the Gila, winning two stages. In July 2011, she finished first in the inaugural Crusher in the Tushar in Beaver, Utah. At the Chrono Gatineau time trials in May 2011, she finished first among an international slate of riders. In June 2012, she was selected to become part of Canada&#x27;s 2012 London Olympics team, as one of four in cycling, with two other women and a man. She finished 32nd, with the peloton, in the road race and finished 5th in the road time trial at the 2012 Olympics.

===Long track speed skating===

In the 2000/2001 season, Hughes made a successful comeback to speed skating, participating in the World Single Distance Championships in Salt Lake City, where she finished 11th in the 3000 m.

The following season, she qualified for the 2002 Winter Olympics. After placing 10th in the 3000 m, she won the bronze medal in the 5000 m, just ahead of compatriot Cindy Klassen. With this, she became the second speed skater to win medals in the Summer and Winter Games — Christa Luding-Rothenburger won a gold in the 1000 m speed skating and silver in the 1000 m cycling sprint in 1988. She became the fourth person and second woman to win medals at the Summer and Winter Games. In 2006, she was the only Olympian to have won multiple medals at the Summer Games as well as at the Winter Games.

In 2006, although she had not been asked, she announced she would not carry the Canadian flag during the opening ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. At those Olympics, she won her first gold medal in the 5000 m and a silver medal in the team pursuit as part of the Canadian team. She earned her fifth Olympic medal at the 2006 Games, tying the total all-time Canadian medal count record, also held by Marc Gagnon and Phillip Edwards. Klassen set a new record in the same games, winning five medals in Turin, for a total of six.

Inspired by Joey Cheek, who donated his gold medal bonus to Right to Play, Hughes donated $10,000 of her own money to Right to Play after her 2006 gold medal win in the 5000 m. (Canada did not give out medal bonuses at the time).

Hughes was also a world record holder on 10,000 m track with 14:19.73 on March 13, 2007, on the Olympic Oval in Calgary, which was beaten by Martina Sáblíková one year later. However, that time is still the Canadian record.

On January 29, 2010, she was announced as the Canadian Flag Bearer for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. During the games she won a bronze medal in the 5,000 metres which was also the final Olympic speed skating race of her career. Her time of 6:55.73 became a new track record, though her time was soon beaten by Stephanie Beckert of Germany and gold medalist Martina Sáblíková of the Czech Republic. This brought her career medals total to six, tying teammate Cindy Klassen as the Canadian athlete with the most medals.

==Personal life==
She is the National Spokesperson for the Bell Canada &#x27;Let&#x27;s Talk Mental Health&#x27; initiative, including Bell &#x27;Let&#x27;s Talk Day&#x27;. Hughes uses her past struggles with depression to relate to others and to help combat issues including the stigma involved with mental health issues. &quot;Hughes battled deep depression, which threatened to derail her life, after winning two bronze medals in cycling at the 1996 Olympics.&quot; Since 2013, Hughes has initiated annual bike rides across Canada in order to raise awareness about mental health. In 2015, a CTV-produced documentary &quot;Clara&#x27;s Big Ride&quot; premiered on the fifth annual Bell Let&#x27;s Talk Day (a national mental health awareness day in Canada). Her memoir, &quot;Open Heart, Open Mind&quot;, was published in 2015.

<doc id="102191" wikidata="Q3301488" url="?curid=102191" title="Right of return">
<text>The right of return is a principle in international law which guarantees everyone&#x27;s right of voluntary return to, or re-entry to, their country of origin or of citizenship. The right of return is part of the broader human rights concept of freedom of movement and is also related to the legal concept of nationality. While many states afford their citizens the right of abode, the right of return is not restricted to citizenship or nationality in the formal sense. It allows stateless persons and for those born outside their country to return for the first time, so long as they have maintained a &quot;genuine and effective link&quot;.

The right is formulated in several modern treaties and conventions, most notably in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1948 Fourth Geneva Convention. Legal scholars have argued that one or more of these international human rights instruments have attained the status of customary international law and that the right of return is therefore binding on non-signatories to these conventions.

The right of return is often invoked by representatives of refugee groups to assert that they have a right to return to the country from which they were displaced.

== History ==
The right to leave any country and to return to one&#x27;s own country are regarded as human rights and are founded on natural law.

=== Ancient precedents ===
While the right of return was not explicitly recognized in antiquity, exile, being explicitly refused permission to return home, was a common punishment for severe crimes. The topic was discussed extensively by antique writers. For example, Teles of Megara in his diatribe &quot;On Exile&quot; wrote &quot;But exiles are not allowed to return home, and this is a severe restriction of their freedom.&quot;

During antiquity, groups of people were frequently deported or uprooted from their cities and homeland, often as part of conquest or as a punishment for rebellion. In some cases they were allowed or encouraged to return, typically after the balance of military and political forces had changed. 

A well-known example is the return to Zion, by which King Cyrus the Great granted the Jews expelled from Judah to Babylon the option to return to their ancestral homeland and rebuild Jerusalem. Recorded in the Hebrew Bible (Book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah) this case is often cited as a precedent by modern Zionists and also inspired other groups seeking to pursue their own return.

During the Peloponnesian War, Athens expelled and scattered the inhabitants of Melos, Aegina and other cities (some of them being sold into slavery). Following the victory of Sparta, the Spartan general Lysander in 405 BC made a concerted effort to gather these exiles and restore them to their original cities.

===Magna Carta===
The first codified law guaranteeing a right of return can be found in the English charter Magna Carta from 1215:
===French Constitution of 1791===
Another early example of national law recognizing the Right of Return was the French constitution of 1791, enacted on 15 December 1790: 
The constitution put an end to the centuries-long persecution and discrimination of Huguenots (French Protestants).

Concurrently with making all Protestants resident in France into full-fledged citizens, the law enacted on December 15, 1790 stated that: 
The revocation of the Edict of Nantes and expulsion of the Huguenots had taken place more than a century earlier, and there were numerous Huguenot emigrants to other countries, where they often intermarried with the population of the host country (see Edict of Potsdam). Therefore, the law potentially conferred French citizenship on numerous Britons, Germans, South Africans and others – though only a fraction actually took advantage of it. This option for Huguenot descendants to gain French citizenship remained open until 1945, when it was abolished – since after the occupation of France, the French were unwilling to let Germans of Huguenot origin take advantage of it.

===Schleswig plebiscites, 1920===

In the aftermath of the Second Schleswig War of 1864, the previously Danish-ruled territory of Schleswig became part of Imperial Germany. A significant number of inhabitants, known as &quot;s&quot;, chose to retain their Danish citizenship and refused to take up a German one. Consequently, they were expelled from the area by Prussian authorities. Half a century later, following the German defeat in the First World War, a plebiscite was held in 1920 to determine the future of the area. The Danish government asked the Allied Powers to let these expelled ethnic Danes and their descendants return to Schleswig and take part in the plebiscite. This was granted, though many of the optants had in the meantime emigrated to the United States, and most of these did not actually come back.

== Legal understanding of the right ==
The right of return principle has been codified in a number of international instruments, including:

Hague Regulations (HR), article 20:

It has been argued that if the HR require the repatriation of prisoners, then it is &quot;obvious&quot; that civilians displaced during conflict must also be allowed to repatriate.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), article 13:

# Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State.
# Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) article 12(4):

Fourth Geneva Convention, article 49:

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, article 5d(ii):

Some controversy exists among scholars on how these articles should be interpreted.

===&quot;His own country&quot;===
The landmark International Court of Justice case the Nottebohm case of 1955 is often cited as staking out more criteria as to what &quot;one&#x27;s country&quot; should be. The court ruled that there needed to be a &quot;genuine and effective&quot; link between the individual and the country. Among the criteria listed for such a link were &quot;a close and enduring connection&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot;, &quot;establishment&quot;, &quot;interests&quot; and &quot;family ties&quot;. The 1955 ruling has been supplanted by more recent conventions and court rulings.

There is some disagreement as to what &quot;his own&quot; and &quot;his country&quot; means in the ICCPR and UDHR. According to the United Nations Human Rights Committee&#x27;s authoritative interpretation from 1999:

According to Agterhuis, the record of negotiations - the travaux préparatoires - of the ICCPR reveals that the wording of article 12(4) was changed from &quot;the right to &quot;return&quot; to one&#x27;s country&quot; to &quot;the right to &quot;enter&quot; one&#x27;s country&quot; was made in order to include nationals or citizens born outside the country and who have never lived therein.

=== Mass displacement ===
Some disagreement exists on whether the right of return is applicable to situations in which whole ethnic groups have been forcibly displaced. Ruth Lapidoth from the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has argued, by citing Stig Jägerskiöld from his 1966 commentary of ICCPR, that the right was not intended to protect groups of displaced people:

Hurst Hannum has made a similar argument:

Austrian human rights lawyer Manfred Nowak has argued the opposite position, that the right of return applies &quot;even if masses of people are claiming this right&quot;. Bracka has argued similarly:

Eric Rosand, legal advisor to the US State Department, used the same argument:

Rosand discusses the views of scholars who do not consider the right of return to be applicable under mass displacement but concludes:

=== Resettled refugees ===
According to Masri, refugee status is independent of right of return. Thus, refugees who acquire new nationalities in their host countries do not necessarily lose their right to return to the countries they left. Masri argues that the resettlement &quot;weakens the link&quot; between the refugee and the source country but that this weakening is not enough to automatically lead to the deprivation of rights.

=== Regional treaties ===
The right of return is also found in many regional treaties, such as article 12(2) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights:
The right is also found in article 3(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights; &quot;[n]o one shall be deprived of the right to enter the territory of the state of which he is a national&quot; and article 22(5) of the American Convention on Human Rights: &quot;[n]o one can be expelled from the territory of the state of which he is a national or be deprived of the right to enter it.&quot; In these conventions the word &quot;national&quot; is used which is considered narrower than &quot;his own country&quot; in article 12(4) of the ICCPR.

==Right of return in case law==
Few cases have dealt with the right of return principle. In 1996, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in a landmark case known as &quot;Loizidou v Turkey&quot;. Mrs Titina Loizidou was a Greek-Cypriot refugee displaced from Northern Cyprus and prevented from returning by Turkey. The court ruled that Turkey had violated Mrs Loizidou&#x27;s human rights, that she should be allowed to return to her home and that Turkey should pay damages to her.

In a similar case, petitioners for the Chagossians asked the ECHR in 2005 to rule about their removal from Diego Garcia by the British government in the 1960s. The court ruled in 2012 that their case was inadmissible and that by accepting compensation, the islanders had forfeited their claim:

== Non-state groups claiming a right of return ==
===Circassians===
Circassians are an indigenous ethnic group originating from the northwestern Caucasus. Throughout the 19th century, the Russian Empire adopted a policy to eradicate Circassians from their ancestral homelands, pushing most surviving Circassians into the diaspora. Many Circassians have expressed an interest in returning to Circassia, particularly Circassians fleeing the conflict in Syria.

=== Georgian refugees and internally displaced people ===

During Abkhazia&#x27;s war of secession in 1992–1993 and the second Abkhazia war in 1998, 200,000–250,000 Georgian civilians became internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees. Abkhazia, while formally agreeing to repatriation, has hindered the return of refugees both officially and unofficially for more than fifteen years.

=== Greek-Cypriots ===

During the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, 40% of the Greek-Cypriot population as well as over half of the Turk-Cypriot population of the island were displaced. The island was divided along ethnic lines and most of the Greek-Cypriot displaced people were not allowed to return to their homes in the northern Turk-Cypriot side and vice versa.

Plans for a solution of the conflict has centered around bilateral agreements of population exchange, such as the Third Vienna Agreement reached in 1975 or the proposed Annan Plan of 2004. In these plans, the right of return was to be severely limited with respect to Greek-Cypriot internally displaced people/refugees to districts such as Kyrenia, Morphou, Famagusta, and parts of Nicosia, despite judgements of the European Court of Human Rights in cases such as Loizidou v. Turkey, and numerous UN resolutions recognizing the right of return (such as SC 361 and GA 3212). Two referendums on the Annan Plan were held in April 2004, separately along ethnic lines. The Annan Plan was overwhelmingly rejected in the Greek-Cypriot referendum.

The right of return continues to remain a stumbling block to the settlement of the Cyprus problem.

=== Diego Garcia Chagossians ===
The Chagossians, an ethnic group residing on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, were expelled to Mauritius in the 1960s, in connection with the erection of an U.S. Military strategic military installation on the island. Ever since, the Chagossians have been conducting a persistent political and legal struggle to return to Diego Garcia. As of 2007, their right to return was recognised by several British courts but the UK government had failed to implement it.

=== Palestinians ===
State succession arises when there is a definitive replacement of one state by another in respect of sovereignty over a given political territory, in conformity with international law. Experts argue that, under those principles, Palestinian citizens who fled or were expelled from the areas that became Israel automatically acquired Israeli nationality with the creation of the state in 1948. Consequently, these individuals, based on their &quot;de jure&quot; nationality, could claim a right to return.

== Countries with laws conferring a right of return ==
===&quot;Abkhazia (self-declared)&quot;===

The law on the repatriation of self-declared Republic of Abkhazia gives the right of return to the ethnic Abkhaz and Abazins who are the descendants of the refugees who left Abkhazia due to the 19th-century conflicts. The State Repatriation Committee provides support to the repatriates.

=== Armenia ===

Article 14 of the Constitution of Armenia (1995) provides that &quot;[i]ndividuals of Armenian origin shall acquire citizenship of the Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure.&quot; This provision is consistent with the &quot;Declaration on Independence of Armenia&quot;, issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Armenia in 1989, which declared at article 4 that &quot;Armenians living abroad are entitled to the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia&quot;.

=== Austria ===
Under Section 58c of the Austrian Citizenship Act (), Austrians and their descendants who were persecuted or feared persecution by Nazi Germany can become Austrian citizens. While Austria does not allow dual citizenship in most circumstances, people who receive citizenship under § 58c may keep their previous citizenship. However, if they later receive another country&#x27;s citizenship, they must renounce their Austrian citizenship and may not re-apply. Alternatively, they can apply for a permit for the retention of Austrian citizenship if they wish to receive another citizenship after claiming Austrian citizenship.

=== Finland ===
People of Finnish origin may receive citizenship by declaration, which is faster and cheaper than naturalization and has fewer requirements. People of Finnish origin can be: 1) children, born abroad, of a Finnish father; 2) 12–17-year-old adopted children; 3) former Finnish citizens; 4) citizens of another Nordic country; 5) 18-22-year-olds with a long residency in Finland. Formerly, Finland also accepted returnees with a Soviet passport (or post-Soviet passport) where the ethnicity was marked as Finnish. This allowed the immigration of Ingrian Finns and other Finns who had remained in the Soviet Union. People who served in the Finnish Defence Forces or Finnish people evacuated by German or Finnish authorities from occupied areas to Finland during World War II also qualified as returnees. However, these options are no longer available, and applicants must qualify for ordinary naturalization instead.

=== France ===

Another early example of national law recognizing the Right of Return was the French constitution of 1791, enacted on 15 December 1790: 
The constitution put an end to the centuries-long persecution and discrimination of Huguenots (French Protestants).. Concurrently with making all Protestants resident in France into full-fledged citizens, the law enacted on December 15, 1790 stated that: 
The revocation of the Edict of Nantes and expulsion of the Huguenots had taken place more than a century earlier, and there were extensive Huguenot diasporas in many countries, where they often intermarried with the population of the host country. Therefore, the law potentially conferred French citizenship on numerous Britons, Germans, South Africans and others – though only a fraction actually took advantage of it. This option for Huguenot descendants to gain French citizenship remained open until 1945, when it was abolished - since after the Occupation of France, the French were unwilling to let Germans of Huguenot origin to take advantage of it. In October 1985, French President François Mitterrand issued a public apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world.

=== Germany ===

German law allows (1) people descending from German nationals of any ethnicity or (2) people of ethnic German descent and living in countries of the former Warsaw Pact (as well as Yugoslavia) the right to &quot;return&quot; to Germany and (&quot;re&quot;)claim German citizenship (, &quot;late emigrants&quot;). After legislative changes in late 1992 this right is &quot;de facto&quot; restricted to ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union. As with many legal implementations of the right of return, the &quot;return&quot; to Germany of individuals who may never have lived in Germany based on their ethnic origin or their descent from German nationals has been controversial. The law is codified in paragraph 1 of Article 116 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which provides access to German citizenship for anyone &quot;who has been admitted to the territory of the German Reich within the boundaries of December 31, 1937, as a refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such person&quot;. Those territories had a Polish minority, which also had German citizenship and after World War II lived in Poland. These Polish people are also or and came especially in the 1980s to Germany, see Emigration from Poland to Germany after World War II. For example Lukas Podolski and Eugen Polanski became German citizens by this law. Paragraph 2 of Article 116 also provides that &quot;Former German citizens who between 30 January 1933 and 8 May 1945 were deprived of their citizenship on political, racial or religious grounds, and their descendants, shall on application have their citizenship restored&quot;. The historic context for Article 116 was the eviction, following World War II, of an estimated 9 million foreign ethnic Germans from other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Another 9 million German nationals in the former eastern German territories, over which Joseph Stalin and eastern neighbour states extended military hegemony in 1945, were expelled as well. These expellees and refugees, known as , were given refugee status and documents, and—as to foreign ethnic Germans—also West German citizenship (in 1949), and resettled in West Germany. The discussion of possible compensation continues; this, however, has been countered by possible claims for war compensation from Germany&#x27;s eastern neighbours, pertaining to both Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender and the series of population transfers carried out under the instruments of Potsdam. Between 1950 and 2016 it is estimated that up to 1,445,210 and their family members, including many ethnic Poles according to Deutsche Welle (for example Lukas Podolski and Eugen Polanski), emigrated from Poland.

=== Ghana ===

Ghana allows people with African ancestry to apply for and be granted the right to stay in Ghana indefinitely, known as the Right of Abode.

=== Greece ===
Various phenomena throughout Greek history (the extensive colonization by classical Greek city states, the vast expansion of Greek culture in Hellenistic times, the large dominions at times held by the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire, and the energetic trading activity by Greeks under the Ottomans) all tended to create Greek communities far beyond the boundaries of modern Greece.

Recognizing this situation, Greece grants citizenship to broad categories of people of ethnic Greek ancestry who are members of the Greek diaspora, including individuals and families whose ancestors have been resident in diaspora communities outside the modern state of Greece for centuries or millennia.

&quot;Foreign persons of Greek origin&quot;, who neither live in Greece nor hold Greek citizenship nor were necessarily born there, may become Greek citizens by enlisting in Greece&#x27;s military forces, under article 4 of the &quot;Code of Greek Citizenship&quot;, as amended by the &quot;Acquisition of Greek Nationality by Aliens of Greek Origin Law&quot; (Law 2130/1993). Anyone wishing to do so must present a number of documents, including &quot;[a]vailable written records ... proving the Greek origin of the interested person and his ancestors&quot;.

Albania has demanded since the 1940s that Greece grant a right of return to the Muslim Cham Albanians, who were expelled from the Greek region of Epirus between 1944 and 1945, at the end of World War II – a demand firmly rejected by the Greeks (see Cham issue).

=== Hungary ===
In 2010, Hungary passed a law granting citizenship and the right of return to descendants of Hungarians living mostly on the former territory of the Kingdom of Hungary and now residing in Hungary&#x27;s neighbouring countries. Slovakia, which has 500,000 ethnic Magyar citizens (10% of its population), objected vociferously.

=== Ireland ===
Present Irish nationality law states that any person with a grandparent born on the island of Ireland can claim Irish nationality by enrollment in the Foreign Births Register. Additionally, the law permits the Minister of Justice to waive the residency requirements for naturalization for a person of &quot;Irish descent or Irish associations&quot;.

=== Israel ===
The Law of Return is legislation enacted by Israel in 1950, that gives all Jews, people of Jewish ancestry up to at least one Jewish grandparent, and their spouses the right to immigrate to and settle in Israel and obtain citizenship, and obliges the Israeli government to facilitate their immigration. Originally, the law applied to Jews only, until a 1970 amendment stated that the rights &quot;are also vested in a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew&quot;. This resulted in several hundreds of thousands of people fitting the above criteria immigrating to Israel (mainly from the former Soviet Union) but not being recognized as Jews by the Israeli religious authorities, which on the basis of halakha recognize only the child of a Jewish mother as being Jewish, or a proselyte to Judaism. Moreover, some of these immigrants, though having a Jewish grandparent, are known to be practicing Christians. People who would be otherwise eligible for this law can be excluded if they can reasonably be considered to constitute a danger to the welfare of the state, have a criminal past, or are wanted fugitives in their countries with the exception of persecution victims. Jews who converted to another religion can also be denied the right of return. Since its inception in 1948, over three million Jews have immigrated to Israel.

=== Latvia ===
According to the law passed in 2013, any person who themself or whose parent or grandparent had Latvian or Livonian ethnicity, did not voluntarily chose a different ethnicity and lived on Latvian territory between 1881 and 17 June 1940, may register Latvian citizenship upon providing proofing documents and passing a language exam.

=== Poland ===

From the Constitution of Poland, Article 52(5): &quot;Anyone whose Polish origin has been confirmed in accordance with statute may settle permanently in Poland.&quot;

=== Portugal ===
On April 12, 2013, the Portuguese parliament unanimously approved a measure that allows the descendants of Jews expelled from Portugal in the 16th century to become Portuguese citizens.

=== Romania ===
Romanian citizenship can be regained or granted to individuals who were Romanian citizens and who lost it for reasons beyond their control or whose citizenship was revoked involuntarily. This legal provision also applies in the case of descendants of former Romanian citizens up to the third degree. 

=== Russia ===
The Russian Federation offers citizenship to individuals descended from Russian ancestors who can demonstrate an affinity for Russian culture and, preferably, speak Russian. Concern about Russia&#x27;s shrinking population prompted the program. This has had a positive effect because this has not only reversed Russia&#x27;s population decline but has also increased the birth rate. Officials estimate that 25 million members of the Russian diaspora are eligible for nationality. The Foreign Ministry has sent emissaries to countries around the world to urge the descendants of Russian emigrants to return home. The majority of these emigrants have returned from Ukraine, many of them young men looking for better education and job opportunities.

=== Spain ===

Sephardi Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492. Despite the requirement by general rule for obtaining Spanish nationality after five years of residence in Spain, by royal decree on 20 December 1924, Sephardi Jews can obtain Spanish nationality with two years of residence in Spain. From 1924 until 2015 Sephardi Jews living abroad could also ask the Spanish Government for a conferment of Spanish nationality, but the Government enjoyed full discretion as to the decision whether to grant Spanish nationality. On 24 June 2015, the Spanish Parliament approved the 12/2015 Act, the Law Granting the Nationality to Sephardi Jews, that grants the Spanish nationality automatically to Sephardi Jews living abroad, provided they can prove that they are descendants of the Sephardi Jews expelled in 1492.

In 2007, the Spanish Parliament approved the 57/2007 Act, the Law of Historical Memory. The 57/2007 Act provides for the descendants of Spaniards living abroad that left Spain because of political persecution during the Civil War and Franco&#x27;s dictatorship – that is the period between 1936 and 1975 – to obtain Spanish nationality.

Finally, following the Anglo-Dutch capture of Gibraltar in August 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish population left, citing their loyalty to the Bourbons and establishing themselves in the surrounding area (which has come to be known as the &quot;Campo de Gibraltar&quot;). The Spanish population established institutions similar to those they maintained in Gibraltar, including the census and the archives in the City of San Roque, which is the city &quot;where Gibraltar lives on&quot;. Some of the population&#x27;s descendants have cited the right of return in order to return to Gibraltar, although their requests have not been currently addressed by the Spanish government.

===United States of America===

The Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees United States citizenship to those born in the United States of America, with very few exceptions. However, children born outside the country to a U.S. citizen may also acquire citizenship under the principle of jus sanguinis. Congress determines who acquires citizenship when born outside the United States. Generally, acquisition of citizenship at birth abroad depends on whether, at the time of the child&#x27;s birth, one or both of the parents was a U.S. citizen; the gender of the U.S. citizen-parent, and whether the parents were married at the time of the child&#x27;s birth. Numerous courts have held that U.S. citizens, including acquired citizens, who are outside the United States have a fundamental right to return to the country.

Large-scale deportations of undocumented immigrants from the United States have resulted in a diaspora of U.S. citizens, especially of Mexican Americans. Children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants became U.S. citizens at birth and, subsequently, joined their parents in Mexico due in part to immigration enforcement. Over time, these U.S. citizens have had children of their own in Mexico, giving rise to a generation of Mexican-born children who acquired U.S. citizenship at birth. These acquired citizens struggle to prove their U.S. citizenship and have been falsely deported and imprisoned when exercising their right to return to the United States.

<text>In the context of the periodic table a nonmetal is a chemical element that mostly lacks distinctive metallic properties. They range from colorless gases like hydrogen to shiny crystals like iodine. Physically, they are usually lighter (less dense) than elements that form metals and are often poor conductors of heat and electricity. Chemically, nonmetals have relatively high electronegativity or usually attract electrons in a chemical bond with another element, and their oxides tend to be acidic.

Seventeen elements are widely recognized as nonmetals. Additionally, some or all of six borderline elements (metalloids) are sometimes counted as nonmetals.

The two lightest nonmetals, hydrogen and helium, together make up about 98% of the mass of the observable universe. Five nonmetallic elements—hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon—make up the bulk of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, biosphere, crust and oceans.

Industrial uses of nonmetals include in electronics, energy storage, agriculture, and chemical production.

Most nonmetallic elements were identified in the 18th and 19th centuries. While a distinction between metals and other minerals had existed since antiquity, a basic classification of chemical elements as metallic or nonmetallic emerged only in the late 18th century. Since then about twenty properties have been suggested as criteria for distinguishing nonmetals from metals.

==Definition and applicable elements==
:&quot;Unless otherwise noted, this article describes the stable form of an element at standard temperature and pressure (STP).&quot;
Nonmetallic chemical elements are often described as lacking properties common to metals, namely shininess, pliability, good thermal and electrical conductivity, and a general capacity to form basic oxides. There is no widely accepted precise definition; any list of nonmetals is open to debate and revision. The elements included depend on the properties regarded as most representative of nonmetallic or metallic character.

Fourteen elements are almost always recognized as nonmetals:


Three more are commonly classed as nonmetals, but some sources list them as &quot;metalloids&quot;, a term which refers to elements regarded as intermediate between metals and nonmetals:
One or more of the six elements most commonly recognized as metalloids are sometimes instead counted as nonmetals: 
About 15–20% of the 118 known elements are thus classified as nonmetals.

==General properties==
===Physical===


Nonmetals vary greatly in appearance, being colorless, colored or shiny.
For the colorless nonmetals (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and the noble gases), no absorption of light happens in the visible part of the spectrum, and all visible light is transmitted.
The colored nonmetals (sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine) absorb some colors (wavelengths) and transmit the complementary or opposite colors. For example, chlorine&#x27;s &quot;familiar yellow-green colour ... is due to a broad region of absorption in the violet and blue regions of the spectrum&quot;. The shininess of boron, graphite (carbon), silicon, black phosphorus, germanium, arsenic, selenium, antimony, tellurium, and iodine is a result of varying degrees of metallic conduction where the electrons can reflect incoming visible light.

About half of nonmetallic elements are gases under standard temperature and pressure; most of the rest are solids. Bromine, the only liquid, is usually topped by a layer of its reddish-brown fumes. The gaseous and liquid nonmetals have very low densities, melting and boiling points, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. The solid nonmetals have low densities and low mechanical strength (being either hard and brittle, or soft and crumbly), and a wide range of electrical conductivity.

This diversity in form stems from variability in internal structures and bonding arrangements. Covalent nonmetals existing as discrete atoms like xenon, or as small molecules, such as oxygen, sulfur, and bromine, have low melting and boiling points; many are gases at room temperature, as they are held together by weak London dispersion forces acting between their atoms or molecules, although the molecules themselves have strong covalent bonds. In contrast, nonmetals that form extended structures, such as long chains of selenium atoms, sheets of carbon atoms in graphite, or three-dimensional lattices of silicon atoms have higher melting and boiling points, and are all solids, as it takes more energy to overcome their stronger bonding. Nonmetals closer to the left or bottom of the periodic table (and so closer to the metals) often have metallic interactions between their molecules, chains, or layers; this occurs in boron, carbon, phosphorus, arsenic, selenium, antimony, tellurium and iodine.
Covalently bonded nonmetals often share only the electrons required to achieve a noble gas electron configuration. For example, nitrogen forms diatomic molecules featuring a triple bonds between each atom, both of which thereby attain the configuration of the noble gas neon. Antimony&#x27;s larger atomic size prevents triple bonding, resulting in buckled layers in which each antimony atom is singly bonded with three other nearby atoms.

Good electrical conductivity occurs when there is metallic bonding, however the electrons in nonmetals are often not metallic. Good electrical and thermal conductivity associated with metallic electrons is seen in carbon (as graphite, along its planes), arsenic, and antimony. Good thermal conductivity occurs in boron, silicon, phosphorus, and germanium; such conductivity is transmitted though vibrations of the crystalline lattices of these elements. Moderate electrical conductivity is observed in the semiconductors boron, silicon, phosphorus, germanium, selenium, tellurium, and iodine.

Many of the nonmetallic elements are hard and brittle, where dislocations cannot readily move so they tend to undergo brittle fracture rather than deforming. Some do deform such as white phosphorus (soft as wax, pliable and can be cut with a knife, at room temperature), in plastic sulfur, and in selenium which can be drawn into wires from its molten state. Graphite is a standard solid lubricant where dislocations move very easily in the basal planes.

====Allotropes====
Over half of the nonmetallic elements exhibit a range of less stable allotropic forms, each with distinct physical properties. For example, carbon, the most stable form of which is graphite, can manifest as diamond, buckminsterfullerene, amorphous and paracrystalline variations. Allotropes also occur for nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, selenium and iodine.

===Chemical===
Nonmetals have relatively high values of electronegativity, and their oxides are usually acidic. Exceptions may occur if a nonmetal is not very electronegative, or if its oxidation state is low, or both. These non-acidic oxides of nonmetals may be amphoteric (like water, H2O) or neutral (like nitrous oxide, N2O), but never basic.

Nonmetals tend to gain electrons during chemical reactions, in contrast to metals which tend to donate electrons. This behavior is related to the stability of electron configurations in the noble gases, which have complete outer shells as summarized by the duet and octet rules of thumb, more correctly explained in terms of valence bond theory.

They typically exhibit higher ionization energies, electron affinities, and standard electrode potentials than metals. Generally, the higher these values are (including electronegativity) the more nonmetallic the element tends to be. For example, the chemically very active nonmetals fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine have an average electronegativity of 3.19—a figure higher than that of any metallic element.

The chemical distinctions between metals and nonmetals is connected to the attractive force between the positive nuclear charge of an individual atom and its negatively charged outer electrons. From left to right across each period of the periodic table, the nuclear charge (number of protons in the atomic nucleus) increases. There is a corresponding reduction in atomic radius as the increased nuclear charge draws the outer electrons closer to the nuclear core. In chemical bonding, nonmetals tend to gain electrons due to their higher nuclear charge, resulting in negatively charged ions.

The number of compounds formed by nonmetals is vast. The first 10 places in a &quot;top 20&quot; table of elements most frequently encountered in 895,501,834 compounds, as listed in the Chemical Abstracts Service register for November 2, 2021, were occupied by nonmetals. Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen collectively appeared in most (80%) of compounds. Silicon, a metalloid, ranked 11th. The highest-rated metal, with an occurrence frequency of 0.14%, was iron, in 12th place. A few examples of nonmetal compounds are: boric acid (), used in ceramic glazes; selenocysteine (), the 21st amino acid of life; phosphorus sesquisulfide (P4S3), found in strike anywhere matches; and teflon ()&quot;n&quot;), used to create non-stick coatings for pans and other cookware.

===Complications===

Adding complexity to the chemistry of the nonmetals are anomalies occurring in the first row of each periodic table block; non-uniform periodic trends; higher oxidation states; multiple bond formation; and property overlaps with metals.

====First row anomaly====
Starting with hydrogen, the first row anomaly primarily arises from the electron configurations of the elements concerned. Hydrogen is notable for its diverse bonding behaviors. It most commonly forms covalent bonds, but it can also lose its single electron in an aqueous solution, leaving behind a bare proton with tremendous polarizing power. Consequently, this proton can attach itself to the lone electron pair of an oxygen atom in a water molecule, laying the foundation for acid-base chemistry. Moreover, a hydrogen atom in a molecule can form a second, albeit weaker, bond with an atom or group of atoms in another molecule. Such bonding, &quot;helps give snowflakes their hexagonal symmetry, binds DNA into a double helix; shapes the three-dimensional forms of proteins; and even raises water&#x27;s boiling point high enough to make a decent cup of tea.&quot;

Hydrogen and helium, as well as boron through neon, have unusually small atomic radii. This phenomenon arises because the 1s and 2p subshells lack inner analogues (meaning there is no zero shell and no 1p subshell), and they therefore experience less electron-electron exchange interactions, unlike the 3p, 4p, and 5p subshells of heavier elements. As a result, ionization energies and electronegativities among these elements are higher than the periodic trends would otherwise suggest. The compact atomic radii of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen facilitate the formation of double or triple bonds.

While it would normally be expected, on electron configuration consistency grounds, that hydrogen and helium would be placed atop the s-block elements, the significant first row anomaly shown by these two elements justifies alternative placements. Hydrogen is occasionally positioned above fluorine, in group 17, rather than above lithium in group 1. Helium is almost always placed above neon, in group 18, rather than above beryllium in group 2.

====Secondary periodicity====

An alternation in certain periodic trends, sometimes referred to as secondary periodicity, becomes evident when descending groups 13 to 15, and to a lesser extent, groups 16 and 17. Immediately after the first row of d-block metals, from scandium to zinc, the 3d electrons in the p-block elements—specifically, gallium (a metal), germanium, arsenic, selenium, and bromine—prove less effective at shielding the increasing positive nuclear charge.

The Soviet chemist gives two more tangible examples:
:&quot;The toxicity of some arsenic compounds, and the absence of this property in analogous compounds of phosphorus [P] and antimony [Sb]; and the ability of selenic acid [] to bring metallic gold [Au] into solution, and the absence of this property in sulfuric [] and [] acids.&quot;

====Higher oxidation states====
:&quot;Roman numerals such as III, V and VIII denote oxidation states&quot;

Some nonmetallic elements exhibit oxidation states that deviate from those predicted by the octet rule, which typically results in an oxidation state of –3 in group 15, –2 in group 16, –1 in group 17, and 0 in group 18. Examples include ammonia NH3, hydrogen sulfide H2S, hydrogen fluoride HF, and elemental xenon Xe. Meanwhile, the maximum possible oxidation state increases from +5 in group 15, to +8 in group 18. The +5 oxidation state is observable from period 2 onward, in compounds such as nitric acid HN(V)O3 and phosphorus pentafluoride PCl5. Higher oxidation states in later groups emerge from period 3 onwards, as seen in sulfur hexafluoride SF6, iodine heptafluoride IF7, and xenon(VIII) tetroxide XeO4. For heavier nonmetals, their larger atomic radii and lower electronegativity values enable the formation of compounds with higher oxidation numbers, supporting higher bulk coordination numbers.

====Multiple bond formation====
Period 2 nonmetals, particularly carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, show a propensity to form multiple bonds. The compounds formed by these elements often exhibit unique stoichiometries and structures, as seen in the various nitrogen oxides, which are not commonly found in elements from later periods.

==== Property overlaps ====
While certain elements have traditionally been classified as nonmetals and others as metals, some overlapping of properties occurs. Writing early in the twentieth century, by which time the era of modern chemistry had been well-established, Humphrey observed that:
:... these two groups, however, are not marked off perfectly sharply from each other; some nonmetals resemble metals in certain of their properties, and some metals approximate in some ways to the non-metals.
Examples of metal-like properties occurring in nonmetallic elements include:
* Silicon has an electronegativity (1.9) comparable with metals such as cobalt (1.88), copper (1.9), nickel (1.91) and silver (1.93);
* The electrical conductivity of graphite exceeds that of some metals;
* Selenium can be drawn into a wire;
* Radon is the most metallic of the noble gases and begins to show some cationic behavior, which is unusual for a nonmetal; and
* In extreme conditions, just over half of nonmetallic elements can form homopolyatomic cations.

Examples of nonmetal-like properties occurring in metals are:
*Tungsten displays some nonmetallic properties, sometimes being brittle, having a high electronegativity, and forming only anions in aqueous solution, and predominately acidic oxides.
*Gold, the &quot;king of metals&quot; has the highest electrode potential among metals, suggesting a preference for gaining rather than losing electrons. Gold&#x27;s ionization energy is one of the highest among metals, and its electron affinity and electronegativity are high, with the latter exceeding that of some nonmetals. It forms the Au– auride anion and exhibits a tendency to bond to itself, behaviors which are unexpected for metals. In aurides (MAu, where M = Li–Cs), gold&#x27;s behavior is similar to that of a halogen. Gold has a large enough nuclear potential that the electrons have to be considered with relativistic effects included which changes some of the properties.

A relatively recent development involves certain compounds of heavier p-block elements, such as silicon, phosphorus, germanium, arsenic and antimony, exhibiting behaviors typically associated with transition metal complexes. This is linked to a small energy gap between their filled and empty molecular orbitals, which are the regions in a molecule where electrons reside and where they can be available for chemical reactions. In such compounds, this allows for unusual reactivity with small molecules like hydrogen (H2), ammonia (NH3), and ethylene (C2H4), a characteristic previously observed primarily in transition metal compounds. These reactions may open new avenues in catalytic applications.

==Types ==
Nonmetal classification schemes vary widely, with some accommodating as few as two subtypes and others identifying up to seven. For example, the periodic table in the Encyclopaedia Britannica recognizes noble gases, halogens, and other nonmetals, and splits the elements commonly recognized as metalloids between &quot;other metals&quot; and &quot;other nonmetals&quot;. On the other hand, seven of twelve color categories on the Royal Society of Chemistry periodic table include nonmetals.
Starting on the right side of the periodic table, three types of nonmetals can be recognized:
 the relatively inert noble gases—helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon;
 the notably reactive halogen nonmetals—fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine; and
 the mixed reactivity &quot;unclassified nonmetals&quot;, a set with no widely used collective name—hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, selenium. The descriptive phrase &quot;unclassified nonmetals&quot; is used here for convenience.

The elements in a fourth set are sometimes recognized as nonmetals:
 the generally unreactive metalloids, sometimes considered a third category distinct from metals and nonmetals—boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium.

The boundaries between these types are not sharp. Carbon, phosphorus, selenium, and iodine border the metalloids and show some metallic character, as does hydrogen.

The greatest discrepancy between authors occurs in metalloid &quot;frontier territory&quot;. Some consider metalloids distinct from both metals and nonmetals, while others classify them as nonmetals. Some categorize certain metalloids as metals (e.g., arsenic and antimony due to their similarities to heavy metals). Metalloids resemble the elements universally considered &quot;nonmetals&quot; in having relatively low densities, high electronegativity, and similar chemical behavior.

=== Noble gases ===
Six nonmetals are classified as noble gases: helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and the radioactive radon. In conventional periodic tables they occupy the rightmost column. They are called &quot;noble&quot; gases due to their exceptionally low chemical reactivity.

These elements exhibit similar properties, characterized by their colorlessness, odorlessness, and nonflammability. Due to their closed outer electron shells, noble gases possess weak interatomic forces of attraction, leading to exceptionally low melting and boiling points. As a consequence, they all exist as gases under standard conditions, even those with atomic masses surpassing many typically solid elements.

Chemically, the noble gases exhibit relatively high ionization energies, negligible or negative electron affinities, and high to very high electronegativities. The number of compounds formed by noble gases is in the hundreds and continues to expand, with most of these compounds involving the combination of oxygen or fluorine with either krypton, xenon, or radon.

=== Halogen nonmetals ===
While the halogen nonmetals are notably reactive and corrosive elements, they can also be found in everyday compounds like toothpaste (NaF); common table salt (NaCl); swimming pool disinfectant (NaBr); and food supplements (KI). The term &quot;halogen&quot; itself means &quot;salt former&quot;.

Chemically, the halogen nonmetals exhibit high ionization energies, electron affinities, and electronegativity values, and are mostly relatively strong oxidizing agents. These characteristics contribute to their corrosive nature. All four elements tend to form primarily ionic compounds with metals, in contrast to the remaining nonmetals (except for oxygen) which tend to form primarily covalent compounds with metals. The highly reactive and strongly electronegative nature of the halogen nonmetals epitomizes nonmetallic character.

=== Unclassified nonmetals ===


Hydrogen behaves in some respects like a metallic element and in others like a nonmetal. Like a metallic element it can, for example, form a solvated cation in aqueous solution; it can substitute for alkali metals in compounds such as the chlorides (NaCl cf. HCl) and nitrates (KNO3 cf. HNO3), and in certain alkali metal complexes as a nonmetal. It attains this configuration by forming a covalent or ionic bond or, if it has initially given up its electron, by attaching itself to a lone pair of electrons.

Some or all of these nonmetals share several properties. Being generally less reactive than the halogens, most of them can occur naturally in the environment. They have significant roles in biology and geochemistry. Collectively, their physical and chemical characteristics can be described as &quot;moderately non-metallic&quot;. Sometimes they have corrosive aspects. Carbon corrosion can occur in fuel cells. Untreated selenium in soils can lead to the formation of corrosive hydrogen selenide gas. Very different, when combined with metals, the unclassified nonmetals can form interstitial or refractory compounds due to their relatively small atomic radii and sufficiently low ionization energies. They also exhibit a tendency to bond to themselves, particularly in solid compounds. Additionally, diagonal periodic table relationships among these nonmetals mirror similar relationships among the metalloids.

==Abundance, extraction, and uses==

===Abundance===

The abundance of elements in the universe results from nuclear physics processes like nucleosynthesis and radioactive decay.

The volatile noble gas nonmetal elements are less abundant in the atmosphere than expected based their overall abundance due to cosmic nucleosynthesis. Mechanisms to explain this difference is an important aspect of planetary science. Even within that challenge, the nonmetal element is unexpectedly depleted. A possible explanation comes from theoretical models of the high pressures in the Earth&#x27;s core suggest there may be around 1013 tons of xenon, in the form of stable XeFe3 and XeNi3 intermetallic compounds.

Five nonmetals—hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon—form the bulk of the directly observable structure of the Earth: about 73% of the crust, 93% of the biomass, 96% of the hydrosphere, and over 99% of the atmosphere, as shown in the accompanying table. Silicon and oxygen form highly stable tetrahedral structures, known as silicates. Here, &quot;the powerful bond that unites the oxygen and silicon ions is the cement that holds the Earth&#x27;s crust together.&quot;

In the biomass, the relative abundance of the first four nonmetals (and phosphorus, sulfur, and selenium marginally) is attributed to a combination of relatively small atomic size, and sufficient spare electrons. These two properties enable them to bind to one another and &quot;some other elements, to produce a molecular soup sufficient to build a self-replicating system.&quot;

===Extraction===
Nine of the 23 nonmetallic elements are gases, or form compounds that are gases, and are extracted from natural gas or liquid air. These elements include hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur, argon, krypton, and xenon. For example, nitrogen and oxygen are extracted from air through fractional distillation of liquid air. This method capitalizes on their different boiling points to separate them efficiently. Sulfur was extracted using the Frasch process, which involved injecting superheated water into underground deposits to melt the sulfur, which is then pumped to the surface. This technique leveraged sulfur&#x27;s low melting point relative to other geological materials. It is now obtained by reacting the hydrogen sulfide in natural gas, with oxygen. Water is formed, leaving the sulfur behind.

 are extracted from the following sources:


 Gases (3): hydrogen, from methane; helium, from natural gas; sulfur, from hydrogen sulfide in natural gas
 Liquids (9): nitrogen, oxygen, neon, argon, krypton and xenon from liquid air; chlorine, bromine and iodine from brine
 Solids (12): boron, from borates; carbon occurs naturally as graphite; silicon, from silica; phosphorus, from phosphates; iodine, from sodium iodate; radon, as a decay product from uranium ores; fluorine, from fluorite; germanium, arsenic, selenium, antimony and tellurium, from sulfides.
===Uses===
Uses of nonmetals and non-metallic elements are broadly categorized as domestic, industrial, attenuative (lubricative, retarding, insulating or cooling), and agricultural

Many have domestic and industrial applications in household accoutrements; medicine and pharmaceuticals; and lasers and lighting. They are components of mineral acids; and prevalent in plug-in hybrid vehicles; and smartphones.

A significant number have attenuative and agricultural applications. They are used in lubricants; and flame retardants and fire extinguishers. They can serve as inert air replacements; and are used in cryogenics and refrigerants. Their significance extends to agriculture, through their use in fertilizers.

Additionally, a smaller number of nonmetals or nonmetallic elements find specialized uses in explosives; and welding gases.

== Taxonomical history ==
===Background===

Around 340 BCE, in Book III of his treatise &quot;Meteorology&quot;, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle categorized substances found within the Earth into metals and &quot;fossiles&quot;. The latter category included various minerals such as realgar, ochre, ruddle, sulfur, cinnabar, and other substances that he referred to as &quot;stones which cannot be melted&quot;.

Until the Middle Ages the classification of minerals remained largely unchanged, albeit with varying terminology. In the fourteenth century, the English alchemist Richardus Anglicus expanded upon the classification of minerals in his work &quot;Correctorium Alchemiae.&quot; In this text, he proposed the existence of two primary types of minerals. The first category, which he referred to as &quot;major minerals&quot;, included well-known metals such as gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and iron. The second category, labeled &quot;minor minerals&quot;, encompassed substances like salts, atramenta (iron sulfate), alums, vitriol, arsenic, orpiment, sulfur, and similar substances that were not metallic bodies.

The term &quot;nonmetallic&quot; dates back to at least the 16th century. In his 1566 medical treatise, French physician Loys de L&#x27;Aunay distinguished substances from plant sources based on whether they originated from metallic or non-metallic soils.

Later, the French chemist Nicolas Lémery discussed metallic and nonmetallic minerals in his work &quot;Universal Treatise on Simple Drugs, Arranged Alphabetically&quot; published in 1699. In his writings, he contemplated whether the substance &quot;cadmia&quot; belonged to either the first category, akin to cobaltum (cobaltite), or the second category, exemplified by what was then known as calamine—a mixed ore containing zinc carbonate and silicate.

===Organization of elements by types===

Just as the ancients distinguished metals from other minerals, similar distinctions developed as the modern idea of chemical elements emerged in the late 1700s. French chemist Antoine Lavoisier published the first modern list of chemical elements in his revolutionary 1789 &quot;Traité élémentaire de chimie&quot;. The 33 elements known to Lavoisier were categorized into four distinct groups, including gases, metallic substances, nonmetallic substances that form acids when oxidized, and earths (heat-resistant oxides). Lavoisier&#x27;s work gained widespread recognition and was republished in twenty-three editions across six languages within its first seventeen years, significantly advancing the understanding of chemistry in Europe and America.

In 1802 the term &quot;metalloids&quot; was introduced for elements with the physical properties of metals but the chemical properties of non-metals. However,
in 1811, the Swedish chemist Berzelius used the term &quot;metalloids&quot; to describe all nonmetallic elements, noting their ability to form negatively charged ions with oxygen in aqueous solutions. 
Thus in 1864, the &quot;Manual of Metalloids&quot; divided all elements into either metals or metalloids, with the latter group including elements now called nonmetals. Reviews of the book indicated that the term &quot;metalloids&quot; was still endorsed by leading authorities, but there were reservations about its appropriateness. While Berzelius&#x27; terminology gained significant acceptance, it later faced criticism from some who found it counterintuitive, misapplied, or even invalid. The idea of designating elements like arsenic as metalloids had been considered. By as early as 1866, some authors began preferring the term &quot;nonmetal&quot; over &quot;metalloid&quot; to describe nonmetallic elements. In 1875, Kemshead observed that elements were categorized into two groups: non-metals (or metalloids) and metals. He noted that the term &quot;non-metal&quot;, despite its compound nature, was more precise and had become universally accepted as the nomenclature of choice.
===Development of types===
In 1844, , a French doctor, pharmacist, and chemist, established a basic taxonomy of nonmetals to aid in their study. He wrote:

:They will be divided into four groups or sections, as in the following:
::Organogens—oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon
::Sulphuroids—sulfur, selenium, phosphorus
::Chloroides—fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine
::Boroids—boron, silicon.

Dupasquier&#x27;s quartet parallels the modern nonmetal types. The organogens and sulphuroids are akin to the unclassified nonmetals. The chloroides were later called halogens. The boroids eventually evolved into the metalloids, with this classification beginning from as early as 1864. The then unknown noble gases were recognized as a distinct nonmetal group after being discovered in the late 1800s.

His taxonomy was noted for its natural basis. That said, it was a significant departure from other contemporary classifications, since it grouped together oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon.

In 1828 and 1859, the French chemist Dumas classified nonmetals as (1) hydrogen; (2) fluorine to iodine; (3) oxygen to sulfur; (4) nitrogen to arsenic; and (5) carbon, boron and silicon, thereby anticipating the vertical groupings of Mendeleev&#x27;s 1871 periodic table. Dumas&#x27; five classes fall into modern groups 1, 17, 16, 15, and 14 to
13 respectively.

===Suggested distinguishing criteria===
Much of the early analyses were phenomenological, and a variety of physical, chemical, and atomic properties have been suggested for distinguishing metals from nonmetals (or other bodies); a comprehensive early set of characteristics was stated by Rev Thaddeus Mason Harrisn in the 1803 &quot;Minor Encyclopedia&quot; .
:&quot;METAL, in natural history and chemistry, the name of a class of simple bodies; of which it is observed, that they posses; a lustre; that they are opaque; that they arc fusible, or may be melted; that their specific gravity is greater than that of any other bodies yet discovered; that they are better conductors of electricity, than any other body; that they are malleable, or capable of being extended and flattened by the hammer; and that they are ductile or tenacious, that is, capable of being drawn out into threads or wires.&quot;

Some criteria did not last long; for instance in 1809, the British chemist and inventor Humphry Davy isolated sodium and potassium, their low densities contrasted with their metallic appearance, so the density property was tenuous although these metals was firmly established by their chemical properties.

Johnson has a similar approach to Mason, distinguishing between metals and nonmetals on the basis of their physical states, electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, and the acid-base nature of their oxides:
# gaseous elements are nonmetals (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine and the noble gases);
# liquids (mercury, bromine) are either metallic or nonmetallic: mercury, as a good conductor, is a metal; bromine, with its poor conductivity, is a nonmetal;
# solids are either ductile and malleable, hard and brittle, or soft and crumbly:
::a. ductile and malleable elements are metals;
::b. hard and brittle elements include boron, silicon and germanium, which are semiconductors and therefore not metals; and
::c. soft and crumbly elements include carbon, phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, antimony, tellurium and iodine, which have acidic oxides indicative of nonmetallic character.
Several authors have noted that nonmetals generally have low densities and high electronegativity. The accompanying table, using a threshold of 7 g/cm3 for density and 1.9 for electronegativity (revised Pauling), shows that all nonmetals have low density and high electronegativity. In contrast, all metals have either high density or low electronegativity (or both). Goldwhite and Spielman added that, &quot;... lighter elements tend to be more electronegative than heavier ones.&quot; The average electronegativity for the elements in the table with densities less than 7 gm/cm3 (metals and nonmetals) is 1.97 compared to 1.66 for the metals having densities of more than 7 gm/cm3.

There is not full agreement about the use of phenomenological properties. Emsley pointed out the complexity of this task, asserting that no single property alone can unequivocally assign elements to either the metal or nonmetal category. Some authors divide elements into metals, metalloids, and nonmetals, but Oderberg disagrees, arguing that by the principles of categorization, anything not classified as a metal should be considered a nonmetal.

Kneen and colleagues proposed that the classification of nonmetals can be achieved by establishing a single criterion for metallicity. They acknowledged that various plausible classifications exist and emphasized that while these classifications may differ to some extent, they would generally agree on the categorization of nonmetals. The describe electrical conductivity as the key property, arguing that this is the most common approach.

One of the most commonly recognized properties used is the temperature coefficient of resistivity, the effect of heating on electrical resistance and conductivity. As temperature rises, the conductivity of metals decreases while that of nonmetals increases. However, plutonium, carbon, arsenic, and antimony appear to defy the norm. When plutonium (a metal) is heated within a temperature range of −175 to +125 °C its conductivity increases. Similarly, despite its common classification as a nonmetallic element, carbon (as graphite) is a semimetal which when heated experiences a decrease in electrical conductivity. Arsenic and antimony, which are occasionally classified as nonmetallic elements are also semimetals, and show behavior similar to carbon.

==Comparison of selected properties==
The two tables in this section list some of the properties of five types of elements (noble gases, halogen nonmetals, unclassified nonmetals, metalloids and, for comparison, metals) based on their most stable forms at standard temperature and pressure. The dashed lines around the columns for metalloids signify that the treatment of these elements as a distinct type can vary depending on the author, or classification scheme in use.

=== Physical properties by element type ===
Physical properties are listed in loose order of ease of their determination.

=== Chemical properties by element type ===
Chemical properties are listed from general characteristics to more specific details.

† Hydrogen can also form alloy-like hydrides
‡ The labels &quot;low&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, and &quot;very high&quot; are arbitrarily based on the value spans listed in the table

<doc id="102194" wikidata="Q503256" url="?curid=102194" title="Sutton Hoo">
<text>Sutton Hoo is the site of two Anglo-Saxon cemeteries dating from the 6th to 7th centuries near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. Archaeologists have been excavating the area since 1938, when an undisturbed ship burial containing a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artifacts was discovered. The site is important in establishing the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia as well as illuminating the Anglo-Saxons during a period which lacks historical documentation.

The site was first excavated by Basil Brown, a self-taught archaeologist, under the auspices of the landowner Edith Pretty, but when its importance became apparent, national experts took over. The artefacts the archaeologists found in the burial chamber include: a suite of metalwork dress fittings in gold and gems, a ceremonial helmet, a shield and sword, a lyre, and silver plate from the Eastern Roman Empire. The ship burial has prompted comparisons with the world of &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The Old English poem is partly set in Götaland in southern Sweden, which has archaeological parallels to some of the Sutton Hoo finds. Scholars believe Rædwald, king of the East Angles, is the most likely person to have been buried in the ship.

During the 1960s and 1980s, the wider area was explored by archaeologists and other burials were revealed. Another burial ground is situated on a second hill-spur about upstream of the first. It was discovered and partially explored in 2000, during preliminary work for the construction of a new tourist visitor centre. The tops of the mounds had been obliterated by agricultural activity. The cemeteries are located close to the River Deben estuary and other archaeological sites. They appear as a group of approximately 20 earthen mounds that rise slightly above the horizon of the hill-spur when viewed from the opposite bank. The visitor centre contains original artefacts, replicas of finds and a reconstruction of the ship burial chamber. The site is in the care of the National Trust; most of these objects are now held by the British Museum.

== Toponym ==

Sutton Hoo derives its name from Old English. &quot;Sut&quot; combined with &quot;tun&quot; means the &quot;southern farmstead&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot; and &quot;hoo&quot; refers to a hill &quot;shaped like a heel spur&quot;. Hoo was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Hoi&quot; / &quot;Hou&quot;.

==Position==
Sutton Hoo lies along a bank of the tidal estuary of the River Deben. There, large mounds – which were originally much higher and more visible – can still be seen, overlooking the upper estuary of the River Deben. On the opposite bank the harbour town of Woodbridge stands from the North Sea and below the lowest convenient fording place. It formed a path of entry into East Anglia during the Sub Roman Britain period that followed the end of Roman imperial rule in the 5th century.

South of Woodbridge, there are 6th-century burial grounds at Rushmere, Little Bealings, and Tuddenham St Martin and circling Brightwell Heath, the site of mounds that date from the Bronze Age. There are cemeteries of a similar date at Rendlesham and Ufford. A ship-burial at Snape is the only one in England that can be compared to the example at Sutton Hoo.

The territory between the Orwell and the watersheds of the Alde and Deben rivers may have been an early centre of royal power, originally centred upon Rendlesham or Sutton Hoo, and a primary component in the formation of the East Anglian kingdom. In the early 7th century, Gipeswic (modern Ipswich) began its growth as a centre for foreign trade, Botolph&#x27;s monastery at Iken was founded by royal grant in 654, and Bede identified Rendlesham as the site of Æthelwold&#x27;s royal dwelling.

== Early settlement ==

=== Neolithic and Bronze Age ===

There is evidence that Sutton Hoo was occupied during the Neolithic period, c. 3000 BC, when woodland in the area was cleared by agriculturalists. They dug small pits that contained flint-tempered earthenware pots. Several pits were near to hollows where large trees had been uprooted: the Neolithic farmers may have associated the hollows with the pots.

During the Bronze Age, when agricultural communities living in Britain were adopting the newly introduced technology of metalworking, timber-framed roundhouses were built at Sutton Hoo, with wattle and daub walling and thatched roofs. The best surviving example contained a ring of upright posts, up to in diameter, with one pair suggesting an entrance to the south-east. In the central hearth, a faience bead had been dropped.

The farmers who dwelt in this house used decorated Beaker-style pottery, cultivated barley, oats, and wheat, and collected hazelnuts. They dug ditches that marked the surrounding grassland into sections, indicating land ownership. The acidic sandy soil eventually became leached and infertile, and it was likely that for this reason, the settlement was eventually abandoned, to be replaced in the Middle Bronze Age (1500–1000 BC) by sheep or cattle, which were enclosed by wooden stakes.

=== Iron Age and Romano-British period ===

During the Iron Age, iron replaced copper and bronze as the dominant form of metal used in the British Isles. In the Middle Iron Age (around 500 BC), people living in the Sutton Hoo area began to grow crops again, dividing the land into small enclosures now known as Celtic fields. The use of narrow trenches implies grape cultivation, whilst in other places, small pockets of dark soil indicate that big cabbages may have been grown. This cultivation continued into the Romano-British period, from 43 to around 410.

Life for the Britons remained unaffected by the arrival of the Romans. Several artefacts from the period, including a few fragments of pottery and a discarded fibula, have been found. As the peoples of Western Europe were encouraged by the Empire to maximise the use of land for growing crops, the area around Sutton Hoo suffered degradation and soil loss. It was eventually abandoned and became overgrown.

== Anglo-Saxon cemetery ==

=== Background ===

After the withdrawal of the Romans from southern Britain after 410, Germanic tribes such as the Angles and Saxons began to settle in the southeastern part of the island. East Anglia is regarded by many scholars as a region in which this settlement was particularly early and dense; the area&#x27;s name derives from that of the Angles. Over time, the remnants of the pre-existing Brittonic population adopted the culture of the newcomers.

During this period, southern Britain became divided up into a number of small independent kingdoms. Several pagan cemeteries from the kingdom of the East Angles have been found, most notably at Spong Hill and Snape, where a large number of cremations and inhumations were found. Many of the graves were accompanied by grave goods, which included combs, tweezers and brooches, as well as weapons. Sacrificed animals had been placed in the graves.

At the time when the Sutton Hoo cemetery was in use, the River Deben would have formed part of a busy trading and transportation network. A number of settlements grew up along the river, most of which would have been small farmsteads, although it seems likely that there was a larger administrative centre as well, where the local aristocracy held court. Archaeologists have speculated that such a centre may have existed at Rendlesham, Melton, Bromeswell or at Sutton Hoo. It has been suggested that the burial mounds used by wealthier families were later appropriated as sites for early churches. In such cases, the mounds would have been destroyed before the churches were constructed.

The Sutton Hoo grave field contained about twenty barrows; it was reserved for people who were buried individually with objects that indicated that they had exceptional wealth or prestige. It was used in this way from around 575 to 625 and contrasts with the Snape cemetery, where the ship-burial and furnished graves were added to a graveyard of buried pots containing cremated ashes.

=== The cremations and inhumations, Mounds 17 and 14 ===
Martin Carver believes that the cremation burials at Sutton Hoo were &quot;among the earliest&quot; in the cemetery. Two were excavated in 1938. Under Mound 3 were the ashes of a man and a horse placed on a wooden trough or dugout bier, a Frankish iron-headed throwing-axe, and imported objects from the eastern Mediterranean, including the lid of a bronze ewer, part of a miniature carved plaque depicting a winged Victory, and fragments of decorated bone from a casket. Under Mound 4 was the cremated remains of a man and a woman, with a horse and perhaps also a dog, as well as fragments of bone gaming-pieces.

In Mounds 5, 6, and 7, Carver found cremations deposited in bronze bowls. In Mound 5 were found gaming-pieces, small iron shears, a cup, and an ivory box. Mound 7 also contained gaming-pieces, as well as an iron-bound bucket, a sword-belt fitting and a drinking vessel, together with the remains of horse, cattle, red deer, sheep, and pig that had been burnt with the deceased on a pyre. Mound 6 contained cremated animals, gaming-pieces, a sword-belt fitting, and a comb. The Mound 18 grave was very damaged, but of similar kind.

Two cremations were found during the 1960s exploration to define the extent of Mound 5, together with two inhumations and a pit with a skull and fragments of decorative foil. In level areas between the mounds, Carver found three furnished inhumations. One small mound held a child&#x27;s remains, along with his buckle and miniature spear. A man&#x27;s grave included two belt buckles and a knife, and that of a woman contained a leather bag, a pin and a chatelaine.

The most impressive of the burials without a chamber is that of a young man who was buried with his horse, in Mound 17. The horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral, in a ritual sufficiently standardised to indicate a lack of sentimental attachment to it. Two undisturbed grave-hollows existed side by side under the mound. The man&#x27;s oak coffin contained his pattern welded sword on his right and his sword-belt, wrapped around the blade, which had a bronze buckle with garnet cloisonné cellwork, two pyramidal strapmounts and a scabbard-buckle.

By the man&#x27;s head were a firesteel and a leather pouch, containing rough garnets and a piece of millefiori glass. Around the coffin were two spears, a shield, a small cauldron and a bronze bowl, a pot, an iron-bound bucket and some animal ribs. In the north-west corner of his grave was a bridle, mounted with circular gilt bronze plaques with interlace ornamentation. These items are on display at Sutton Hoo.

Inhumation graves of this kind are known from both England and Germanic continental Europe, with most dating from the 6th or early 7th century. In about 1820, an example was excavated at Witnesham. There are other examples at Lakenheath in western Suffolk and in the Snape cemetery: Other examples have been inferred from records of the discovery of horse furniture at Eye and Mildenhall.

Although the grave under Mound 14 had been destroyed almost completely by robbing, apparently during a heavy rainstorm, it had contained exceptionally high-quality goods belonging to a woman. These included a chatelaine, a kidney-shaped purse-lid, a bowl, several buckles, a dress-fastener, and the hinges of a casket, all made of silver, and also a fragment of embroidered cloth.

=== Mound 2 ===

This important grave, damaged by looters, was probably the source of the many iron ship-rivets found at Sutton Hoo in 1860. In 1938, when the mound was excavated, iron rivets were found, which enabled the Mound 2 grave to be interpreted as a small boat. Carver&#x27;s re-investigation revealed that there was a rectangular plank-lined chamber, long by wide, sunk below the land surface, with the body and grave-goods laid out in it. A small ship had been placed over this in an east–west alignment before a large earth mound was raised.

Chemical analysis of the chamber floor has suggested the presence of a body in the south-western corner. The goods found included fragments of a blue glass cup with a trailed decoration, similar to the recent find from the Prittlewell tomb in Essex. There were two gilt-bronze discs with animal interlace ornament, a bronze brooch, a silver buckle, and a gold-coated stud from a buckle. Four objects had a special kinship with the Mound 1 finds: the tip of a sword blade showed elaborate pattern welding; silver-gilt drinking horn-mounts (struck from the same dies as those in Mound 1); and the similarity of two fragments of dragon-like mounts or plaques. Although the rituals were not identical, the association of the contents of the grave shows a connection between the two burials.

=== The execution burials ===
The cemetery contained remains of people who died violently, in some cases by hanging and decapitation. Often the bones have not survived, but the flesh had stained the sandy soil: the soil was laminated as digging progressed, so that the emaciated figures of the dead were revealed. Casts were taken of several of these.

The identification and discussion of these burials was led by Carver. Two main groups were excavated, with one arranged around Mound 5 and the other situated beyond the barrow cemetery limits in the field to the east. It is thought that a gallows once stood on Mound 5, in a prominent position near to a significant river-crossing point, and that the graves contained the bodies of criminals, possibly executed from the 8th and 9th centuries onwards.

=== The new grave field ===

In 2000, a Suffolk County Council team excavated the site intended for the National Trust&#x27;s new visitor centre, north of Tranmer House, at a point where the ridge of the Deben valley veers westwards to form a promontory. When the topsoil was removed, early Anglo-Saxon burials were discovered in one corner, with some possessing high-status objects. The area had first attracted attention with the discovery of part of a 6th-century bronze vessel, of eastern Mediterranean origin, that had probably formed part of a furnished burial. The outer surface of the so-called &quot;Bromeswell bucket&quot; was decorated with a Syrian- or Nubian-style frieze, depicting naked warriors in combat with leaping lions, and had an inscription in Greek that translated as &quot;Use this in good health, Master Count, for many happy years.&quot;

In an area near to a former rose garden, a group of moderate-sized burial mounds was identified. They had long since been levelled, but their position was shown by circular ditches that each enclosed a small deposit indicating the presence of a single burial, probably of unurned human ashes. One burial lay in an irregular oval pit that contained two vessels, a stamped black earthenware urn of late 6th-century type, and a well-preserved large bronze hanging bowl, with openwork hook escutcheons and a related circular mount at the centre. In another burial, a man had been laid next to his spear and covered with a shield of normal size. The shield bore an ornamented boss-stud and two fine metal mounts, ornamented with a predatory bird and a dragon-like creature.
=== Mound 1 ===
The ship-burial discovered under Mound 1 in 1939 contained one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, far-reaching connections, the quality and beauty of its contents, and for the profound interest it generated.

==== The burial ====

Although practically none of the original timber survived, the form of the ship was perfectly preserved. Stains in the sand had replaced the wood but had preserved many construction details. Nearly all of the iron planking rivets were in their original places. It was possible to survey the original ship, which was found to be long, pointed at either end with tall rising stem and stern posts and widening to in the beam amidships with an inboard depth of over the keel line.

From the keel board, the hull was constructed clinker-fashion with nine planks on either side, fastened with rivets. Twenty-six wooden ribs strengthened the form. Repairs were visible: this had been a seagoing vessel of excellent craftsmanship, but there was no descending keel. The decking, benches and mast were removed. In the fore and aft sections along the gunwales, there were oar-rests shaped like the Old English letter &quot;thorn&quot;, indicating that there may have been positions for forty oarsmen. The central chamber had timber walls at either end and a roof, which was probably pitched.

The heavy oak vessel had been hauled from the river up the hill and lowered into a prepared trench, so only the tops of the stem and stern posts rose above the land surface. After the addition of the body and the artefacts, an oval mound was constructed, which covered the ship and rose above the horizon at the riverward side of the cemetery. The view to the river is now obscured by Top Hat Wood, but the mound would have been a visible symbol of power to those using the waterway. This appears to have been the final occasion upon which the Sutton Hoo cemetery was used for its original purpose.

Long afterwards, the roof collapsed violently under the weight of the mound, compressing the ship&#x27;s contents into a seam of earth.

Using the imprint of the longship in the sand around its location, archaeologist Angela Care Evans made plans to create a full size replica. Work began in 2021, using oak planks and iron rivets, with help from a charity, the Sutton Hoo Ship&#x27;s Company. The estimated date of completion was 2024 and the ship was expected to be functional. Shipwright, Tim Kirk, made this comment to ITV News: &quot;it is really just a big experimental archaeology programme, [but] we&#x27;re hoping to learn how the ship actually sailed&quot;. The plans called for training a crew of at least 80 rowers.

==== The body in the ship-burial ====

The presence of a platform (or a large coffin) that was about indicated that there was a body present. An iron-bound wooden bucket, an iron lamp containing beeswax, and a bottle of north continental manufacture were close by. The objects around the body indicate that it lay with the head at the west end of the wooden structure.

The man who was buried under Mound 1 cannot be identified. Artefacts near the body have been identified as regalia, pointing to its being that of a king. Most of the suggestions for the occupant are East Anglian kings because of the proximity of the royal vill of Rendlesham. Since 1940, when H.M. Chadwick first ventured that the ship-burial was probably the grave of Rædwald, the identification with Rædwald has gained widespread scholarly acceptance

From time to time, other identifications are suggested, including his sons Eorpwald, Sigeberht or Ecgric. Rædwald is the most likely of the candidates because of the high quality of the imported and commissioned materials and the resources needed to assemble them, the authority that the gold was intended to convey, the community involvement required to conduct the ritual at a cemetery reserved for an elite, the close proximity of Sutton Hoo to Rendlesham and the probable date horizons.

As of 2019, the refurbished museum on the site states that the body is Rædwald while the British Museum just says a &quot;King of East Anglia&quot;. Analysis of the Merovingian coins by Gareth Williams, Curator of Early Medieval Coinage at the British Museum, has narrowed the date of the burial to 610 to 635. This makes Sigeberht, who died in 637, less likely. Rædwald is still the favourite, although Eorpwald also fits the timescale as he died 627–28.

Although this is a likely explanation it is still controversial, as reflected in the comments in the article on Rædwald in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (&quot;It has been argued, more strongly than convincingly, that Rædwald must be the man buried in Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo&quot;) and by McClure and Collins, who note that the evidence for Rædwald is &quot;almost non-existent&quot;. Alternative suggestions as candidates include other East Anglian kings or a prestigious foreign visitor, or a wealthy status-seeker, rather than a king, though Rendlesham, a known residence of the East Anglian kings, is only away. In 2025 Helen Gittos from Oxford University argued that the body was an elite local soldier who had fought for the Byzantine Empire, probably as a member of the cavalry troops known as the &quot;Foederati&quot;.

Closer inspection of the sword hilt suggests that the occupant was left-handed, as the hilt&#x27;s malleable gold pieces are worn down on the opposite side than would be expected with a right-handed owner. The unorthodox sword placement on the right side of the body supports this theory, as other Anglo Saxon burials placed the sword on the left side of the body.

As a body was not found, there was early speculation that the ship-burial was a cenotaph rather than a grave. The only sign of body being a chemical stain which could have had other origins; indeed, the site includes burials of both meat and companion animals. Further, there is a lack of shroud ties, and no clear evidence of items which might have adorned a body being left in the expected places in relation to the stain. However, more recent analysis detected phosphate in the soil – an indicator that a human body once lay at rest there. The cenotaph theory may be consistent with the transition from pagan burial to Christian burial; certainly as far as Rædwald is concerned, he could have received a Christian burial, and the mound, whether completed before or after his conversion, being used as a memorial and as symbol of the status of the Kingship of East Anglia. Soil analyses conducted in 1967 found phosphate traces, supporting the view that a body had disappeared in the acidic soil.

== The objects in the burial chamber ==
David M. Wilson has remarked that the metal artworks found in the Sutton Hoo graves were &quot;work of the highest quality, not only in English but in European terms&quot;.

Sutton Hoo is a cornerstone of the study of art in Britain in the 6th–9th centuries. George Henderson has described the ship treasures as &quot;the first proven hothouse for the incubation of the Insular style&quot;. The gold and garnet fittings show the creative fusion of earlier techniques and motifs by a master goldsmith. Insular art drew upon Irish, Pictish, Anglo-Saxon, native British and Mediterranean artistic sources: the 7th-century Book of Durrow owes as much to Pictish sculpture, British millefiori and enamelwork and Anglo-Saxon cloisonné metalwork as it does to Irish art. The Sutton Hoo treasures represent a continuum from pre-Christian royal accumulation of precious objects from diverse cultural sources, through to the art of gospel books, shrines and liturgical or dynastic objects.

The mound was found to contain a uniquely rich Anglo-Saxon ship-burial in the centre of which was a chamber containing grave goods including jewellery, silver bowls, drinking vessels, clothing and weaponry.

=== The head area: the helmet, bowls and spoons ===

On the head&#x27;s left side was placed a &quot;crested&quot; and masked helmet wrapped in cloths. With its panels of tinned bronze and assembled mounts, the decoration is directly comparable to that found on helmets from the Vendel and Valsgärde burial sites in eastern Sweden. The Sutton Hoo helmet differs from the Swedish examples in having an iron skull of a single vaulted shell and has a full face mask, a solid neck guard and deep cheekpieces. These features have been used to suggest an English origin for the helmet&#x27;s basic structure; the deep cheekpieces have parallels in the Coppergate helmet, found in York.

Although outwardly very like the Swedish examples, the Sutton Hoo helmet is a product of better craftsmanship. Helmets are extremely rare finds. No other such figural plaques were known in England, apart from a fragment from a burial at Caenby, Lincolnshire, until the 2009 discovery of the Staffordshire hoard, which contained many. The helmet rusted in the grave and was shattered into hundreds of tiny fragments when the chamber roof collapsed. These fragments were catalogued and organised so they could be reassembled.

To the head&#x27;s right was placed inverted a nested set of ten silver bowls, probably made in the Eastern Empire during the sixth century. Beneath them were two silver spoons, possibly of Byzantine origin, of a type bearing names of the Apostles. One spoon is marked in original nielloed Greek lettering with the name of PAULOS, &quot;Paul&quot;. The other, matching spoon had been modified using lettering conventions of a Frankish coin-die cutter, to read SAULOS, &quot;Saul&quot;. One theory suggests that the spoons (and possibly also the bowls) were a baptismal gift for the buried person.

=== The weapons on the right side of the body ===

On the right of the &quot;body&quot; lay a set of s, tips uppermost, including three barbed angons, with their heads thrust through a handle of the bronze bowl. Nearby was a wand with a small mount depicting a wolf. Closer to the body lay the sword with a gold and garnet cloisonné pommel long, its pattern welded blade still within its scabbard, with superlative scabbard-bosses of domed cellwork and pyramidal mounts. Attached to this and lying toward the body was the sword harness and belt, fitted with a suite of gold mounts and strap-distributors of extremely intricate garnet cellwork ornament.

=== Upper body area: purse, shoulder-clasps and great buckle ===

Together with the sword harness and scabbard mounts, the gold and garnet objects found in the upper body space, which form a co-ordinated ensemble, are among the true wonders of Sutton Hoo. Their artistic and technical quality is exceptional.

The &quot;great&quot; gold buckle is made in three parts. The plate is a long ovoid of a meandering but symmetrical outline with densely interwoven and interpenetrating ribbon animals rendered in chip-carving on the front. The gold surfaces are punched to receive niello detail. The plate is hollow and has a hinged back, forming a secret chamber, possibly for a relic. Both the tongue-plate and hoop are solid, ornamented, and expertly engineered.

Each shoulder-clasp consists of two matching curved halves, hinged upon a long removable chained pin. The surfaces display panels of interlocking stepped garnets and chequer millefiori insets, surrounded by interlaced ornament of Germanic Style II ribbon animals. The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking wild boars with filigree surrounds. On the underside of the mounts are lugs for attachment to a stiff leather cuirass. The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon cuirass clasps are known.

The ornamental purse-lid, covering a lost leather pouch, hung from the waist-belt. The lid consists of a kidney-shaped cell work-frame enclosing a sheet of the horn, on which were mounted pairs of exquisite garnet cell work plaques depicting birds, wolves devouring men (or the ancient motif of the Master of Animals), geometric motifs and a double panel showing animals with interlaced extremities. The maker derived these images from the ornament of the Swedish-style helmets and shield-mounts. In his work, they are transferred into the cell work medium with dazzling technical and artistic virtuosity.

These are the work of a master-goldsmith of the highest level in Europe who had access to an East Anglian armoury containing the objects used as pattern sources. As an ensemble they enabled the patron to appear imperial.
The purse contained thirty-seven gold shillings or tremisses, each originating from a different Frankish mint. They were deliberately collected. There were also three blank coins and two small ingots. This has prompted various explanations: possibly like the Roman &quot;obolus&quot; they may have been left to pay the forty ghostly oarsmen in the afterworld or were a funeral tribute, or an expression of allegiance. They provide the primary evidence for the date of the burial, which was debatably in the third decade of the 7th century.

=== The lower body and &#x27;heaps&#x27; areas ===

In the area corresponding to the lower legs of the body were laid out various drinking vessels, including a pair of drinking horns made from the horns of an aurochs, extinct since early medieval times. These have matching die-stamped gilt rim mounts and vandykes, of similar workmanship and design to the shield mounts, and exactly similar to the surviving horn vandykes from Mound 2. In the same area stood a set of maplewood cups with similar rim-mounts and vandykes, and a heap of folded textiles lay on the left side.

A large quantity of material including metal objects and textiles was formed into two folded or packed heaps on the east end of the central wooden structure. This included the extremely rare survival of a long coat of ring-mail, made of alternate rows of welded and riveted iron links, two hanging bowls, leather shoes, a cushion stuffed with feathers, folded objects of leather and a wooden platter. At one side of the heaps lay an iron hammer-axe with a long iron handle, possibly a weapon.

On top of the folded heaps was set a fluted silver dish with drop handles, probably made in Italy, with the relief image of a female head in late Roman style worked into the bowl. This contained a series of small burr-wood cups with rim-mounts, combs of antler, small metal knives, a small silver bowl, and various other small effects (possibly toilet equipment), and including a bone gaming-piece, thought to be the &#x27;king piece&#x27; from a set. (Traces of bone above the head position have suggested that a gaming-board was possibly set out, as at Taplow.) Above these was a silver ladle with gilt chevron ornament, also of Mediterranean origin.

Over the whole of this, perched on top of the heaps, or their container, if there was one, lay a very large round silver platter with chased ornament, made in the Eastern Empire circa 500 and bearing the control stamps of Emperor Anastasius I (491–518). On this plate was deposited a piece of unburnt bone of uncertain derivation. The assemblage of Mediterranean silverware in the Sutton Hoo grave is unique for this period in Britain and Europe.
=== The west and east walls ===
Along the inner west wall (i.e. the head end) at the north-west corner stood a tall iron stand with a grid near the top. Beside this rested a very large circular shield, with a central boss, mounted with garnets and with die-pressed plaques of interlaced animal ornament. The shield front displayed two large emblems with garnet settings, one a composite metal predatory bird and the other a flying dragon. It also bore animal-ornamented sheet strips directly die-linked to examples from the early cemetery at Vendel near Old Uppsala in Sweden. A small bell, possibly for an animal, lay nearby.

Along the wall was a long square-sectioned whetstone, tapered at either end and carved with human faces on each side - but which showed no sign of previous use as a tool. A ring mount, topped by a bronze antlered stag figurine, was fixed to the upper end, possibly made to resemble a late Roman consular sceptre. The purpose of the sceptre has generated considerable debate and a number of theories, some of which point to the potential religious significance of the stag. or a symbol of the office of &quot;bretwalda&quot; which would have pointed to Rædwald. South of the sceptre was an iron-bound wooden bucket, one of several in the grave.

In the south-west corner was a group of objects which may have been hung up, but when discovered, were compressed together. They included a Coptic or eastern Mediterranean bronze bowl with drop handles and figures of animals, found below a badly deformed six-stringed Anglo-Saxon lyre in a beaver-skin bag, of a Germanic type found in wealthy Anglo-Saxon and north European graves of this date. Uppermost was a large and exceptionally elaborate three-hooked hanging bowl of Insular production, with champleve enamel and millefiori mounts showing fine-line spiral ornament and red cross motifs and with an enamelled metal fish mounted to swivel on a pin within the bowl.

At the east end of the chamber, near the north corner, stood an iron-bound tub of yew containing a smaller bucket. To the south were two small bronze cauldrons, which were probably hung against the wall. A large carinated bronze cauldron, similar to the example from a chamber-grave at Taplow, with iron mounts and two ring-handles was hung by one handle. Nearby lay an iron chain almost long, of complex ornamental sections and wrought links, for suspending a cauldron from the beams of a large hall. The chain was the product of a British tradition dating back to pre-Roman times. All these items were of a domestic character.

=== Textiles ===

The burial chamber was evidently rich in textiles, represented by many fragments preserved, or by chemicals formed by corrosion. They included quantities of twill, possibly from cloaks, blankets or hangings, and the remains of cloaks with characteristic long-pile weaving. There appear to have been more exotic coloured hangings or spreads, including some (possibly imported) woven in stepped lozenge patterns using a Syrian technique in which the weft is looped around the warp to create a textured surface. Two other colour-patterned textiles, near the head and foot of the body area, resemble Scandinavian work of the same period.

== Comparisons ==

=== Similarities with Swedish burials ===

The strong similarities in both the armour and the burial with Vendel Period finds from Sweden have suggested a Swedish cultural influence at Sutton Hoo.

A series of excavations in 1881–83 by Hjalmar Stolpe revealed 14 graves in the village of Vendel in eastern Sweden. Several of the burials were contained in boats up to long and were furnished with swords, shields, helmets and other items. Beginning in 1928, another gravefield containing princely burials was excavated at Valsgärde. The pagan custom of furnished burial may have reached a natural culmination as Christianity began to make its mark.

The Vendel and Valsgärde graves also included ships, similar artefact groups, and many sacrificed animals. Ship-burials for this period are largely confined to eastern Sweden and East Anglia. The earlier mound-burials at Old Uppsala, in the same region, have a more direct bearing on the &quot;Beowulf&quot; story, but do not contain ship-burials. The famous Gokstad and Oseberg ship-burials of Norway are of a later date.

The inclusion of drinking-horns, lyre, sword and shield, bronze and glass vessels is typical of high-status chamber-graves in England. The similar selection and arrangement of the goods in these graves indicates a conformity of household possessions and funeral customs between people of this status, with the Sutton Hoo ship-burial being a uniquely elaborated version, of exceptional quality. Unusually, Sutton Hoo included regalia and instruments of power and had direct Scandinavian connections.

A possible explanation for such connections lies in the well-attested northern custom by which the children of leading men were often raised away from home by a distinguished friend or relative. A future East Anglian king, whilst being fostered in Sweden, could have acquired high-quality objects and made contact with armourers, before returning to East Anglia to rule.

Carver argues that pagan East Anglian rulers would have responded to the growing encroachment of Roman Christendom by employing ever more elaborate cremation rituals, so expressing defiance and independence. The execution victims, if not sacrificed for the ship-burial, perhaps suffered for their dissent from the cult of Christian royalty: their executions may coincide in date with the period of Mercian hegemony over East Anglia in about 760–825.

The parallels with the Swedish burials has led some historians, such as Rupert Bruce-Mitford to put forward a Scandinavian origin for the Wuffingas dynasty, although the significant differences, and lack of exact parallels with the workmanship and style of the Sutton Hoo artefacts means the connection is generally regarded as unproven.

=== Connections with &quot;Beowulf&quot; ===

&quot;Beowulf&quot;, the Old English epic poem set in Denmark and Sweden (mostly Götaland) during the first half of the 6th century, opens with the funeral of the great Danish king, Skjöldr (a.k.a. Scyld Scefing or Shield Sheafson), in a ship laden with treasure and has other descriptions of hoards, including Beowulf&#x27;s own mound-burial. Its picture of warrior life in the hall of the Danish Scylding clan, with formal mead-drinking, minstrel recitation to the lyre and the rewarding of valour with gifts, and the description of a helmet, could all be illustrated from the Sutton Hoo finds. The east Sweden connections seen in several of the Sutton Hoo artefacts reinforce the link to the world of &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

Several scholars have explained how interpretations of Sutton Hoo and &quot;Beowulf&quot; have had a bearing on the other. Roberta Frank has demonstrated that the Sutton Hoo discovery initiated an increase in appearances of &#x27;silver&#x27; in &quot;Beowulf&quot; translations despite the absence of Old English words connoting silver in the poem.

Sam Newton draws together the Sutton Hoo and &quot;Beowulf&quot; links with the Rædwald identification. Using genealogical data, he argues that the Wuffing dynasty derived from the Geatish house of Wulfing, mentioned in both &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the poem &quot;Widsith&quot;. Possibly the oral materials from which &quot;Beowulf&quot; was assembled belonged to East Anglian royal tradition, and they and the ship-burial took shape together as heroic restatements of migration-age origins.

Christopher Brooke in &quot;The Saxon &amp; Norman Kings&quot; (1963) gives copious notes regarding &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the Sutton Hoo treasure and relates the life of the chiefs in the literary work with the 1939 discovery of the ship-burial.

== Excavations ==

=== Before 1938 ===
In medieval times the westerly end of the mound was dug away and a boundary ditch was laid out. Therefore, when looters dug into the apparent centre during the sixteenth century, they missed the real centre: nor could they have foreseen that the deposit lay very deep in the belly of a buried ship, well below the level of the land surface.

In the 16th century, a pit, dated by bottle shards left at the bottom, was dug into Mound 1, narrowly missing the burial. The area was explored extensively during the 19th century, when a small viewing platform was constructed, but no useful records were made. In 1860 it was reported that nearly two bushels of iron screw bolts, presumably ship rivets, had been found at the recent opening of a mound and that it was hoped to open others.

=== Basil Brown and Charles Phillips: 1938–1939 ===
In 1910, a mansion, Tranmer House, was built a short distance from the mounds. In 1926 the Tranmer estate was purchased by Colonel Frank Pretty, a retired military officer who had recently married. In 1934, Pretty died, leaving a widow, Edith Pretty, and young son, Robert Dempster Pretty. Following her bereavement, Edith became interested in Spiritualism, a popular religious movement that purported to enable the living to communicate with the dead.

In 1937, Pretty decided to organise an excavation of the mounds. Through the Ipswich Museum, she obtained the services of Basil Brown, a self-taught Suffolk archaeologist who had taken up full-time investigations of Roman sites for the museum. In June 1938, Pretty took him to the site, offered him accommodation and a wage of 30 shillings a week, and suggested that he start digging at Mound 1.

Because it had been disturbed by earlier grave diggers, Brown, in consultation with the Ipswich Museum, decided instead to open three smaller mounds (2, 3 and 4). These only revealed fragmented artefacts, as the mounds had been robbed of valuable items. In Mound 2 he found iron ship-rivets and a disturbed chamber burial that contained unusual fragments of metal and glass artefacts. At first, it was undecided as to whether they were Early Anglo-Saxon or Viking objects. The Ipswich Museum then became involved with the excavations; the finds became part of the museum&#x27;s collection.

In May 1939, Brown began work on Mound 1, helped by Pretty&#x27;s gardener John (Jack) Jacobs, her gamekeeper William Spooner, and another estate worker Bert Fuller. (Jacobs lived with his wife and their three children at Sutton Hoo House.) They drove a trench from the east end and on the third day discovered an iron rivet which Brown identified as a ship&#x27;s rivet. Within hours others were found still in position. The colossal size of the find became apparent. After several weeks of patiently removing earth from the ship&#x27;s hull, they reached the burial chamber.
The following month, Charles Phillips of Cambridge University heard rumours of a ship discovery. He was taken to Sutton Hoo by Mr Maynard, the Ipswich Museum curator, and was staggered by what he saw. Within a short time, following discussions with the Ipswich Museum, the British Museum, the Science Museum, and Office of Works, Phillips had taken over responsibility for the excavation of the burial chamber.

Initially, Phillips and the British Museum instructed Brown to cease excavating until they could get their team assembled, but he continued working, something which may have saved the site from being looted by treasure hunters. Phillips&#x27;s team included W.F. Grimes and O.G.S. Crawford of the Ordnance Survey, Peggy Piggott (later known as Margaret Guido) and Stuart Piggott, and other friends and colleagues. Extensive photography of the ship excavation was made by Mercie Lack and Barbara Wagstaff.

The need for secrecy and various vested interests led to a confrontation between Phillips and the Ipswich Museum. In 1935–1936 Phillips and his friend Grahame Clark had taken control of The Prehistoric Society. Maynard, then turned his attention to developing Brown&#x27;s work for the museum. Phillips, who disliked the museum&#x27;s honorary president, Reid Moir, F.R.S., had now reappeared, and he deliberately excluded Moir and Maynard from the new discovery at Sutton Hoo. After Ipswich Museum prematurely announced the discovery, reporters attempted to access the site, so Pretty paid for two policemen to guard the site 24 hours a day.

The finds, having been packed and removed to London, were brought back for a treasure trove inquest held that autumn at Sutton village hall, where it was decided that since the treasure was buried without the intention to recover it, it was the property of Pretty as the landowner. Pretty decided to bequeath the treasure as a gift to the nation, so that the meaning and excitement of her discovery could be shared by everyone.

When World War II broke out in September 1939, the grave-goods were put in storage. Sutton Hoo was used as a training ground for military vehicles. Phillips and colleagues produced important publications in 1940 including a dedicated issue of &quot;Antiquity&quot;.

=== Rupert Bruce-Mitford: 1965–1971 ===

After the war ended in 1945, the Sutton Hoo artefacts were removed from storage. A team, led by Rupert Bruce-Mitford, from the British Museum&#x27;s Department of British and Medieval Antiquities, determined their nature and helped to reconstruct and replicate the sceptre and helmet. They also oversaw the conservation of the artefacts, to protect them and enable them to be viewed by the public.

From analysing the data collected in 1938–39, Bruce-Mitford concluded that there were still unanswered questions. As a result of his interest in excavating previously unexplored areas of the Sutton Hoo site, a second archaeological investigation was organised. In 1965, a British Museum team began work, continuing until 1971. The ship impression was re-exposed and found to have suffered some damage, not having been back-filled after excavation in 1939.

Nevertheless, it remained sufficiently intact for a plaster cast to be taken and a fiberglass shape produced. The decision was then made to destroy the impression in order to excavate underneath. The mound was later restored to its pre-1939 appearance. The team also determined the limits of Mound 5 and investigated evidence of prehistoric activity on the original land-surface. They scientifically analysed and reconstructed some of the finds.

The three volumes of Bruce-Mitford&#x27;s definitive text, &quot;The Sutton Hoo Ship-Burial&quot;, were published in 1975, 1978 and 1983.

=== Martin Carver: 1983–1992 ===
In 1978 a committee was formed in order to mount a third and even larger excavation at Sutton Hoo. Backed by the Society of Antiquaries of London, the committee proposed an investigation to be led by Philip Rahtz from the University of York and Rupert Bruce-Mitford, but the British Museum&#x27;s reservations led to the committee deciding to collaborate with the Ashmolean Museum. The committee recognised that much had changed in archaeology since the early 1970s. The Conservatives&#x27; privatisation policies signalled a decrease in state support for such projects, whilst the emergence of post-processualism in archaeological theory moved many archaeologists toward focussing on concepts such as social change.

The Ashmolean&#x27;s involvement convinced the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries to help fund the project. In 1982, Martin Carver from the University of York was appointed to run the excavation, with a research design aimed at exploring &quot;the politics, social organisation and ideology&quot; of Sutton Hoo. Despite opposition by those who considered that funds available could be better used for rescue archaeology, in 1983 the project went ahead.

Carver believed in restoring the overgrown site, much of which was riddled with rabbit warrens. After the site was surveyed using new techniques, the topsoil was stripped across an area that included Mounds 2, 5, 6, 7, 17 and 18. A new map of soil patterns and intrusions was produced that showed that the mounds had been sited in relation to prehistoric and Roman enclosure patterns. Anglo-Saxon graves of execution victims were found which were determined to be younger than the primary mounds. Mound 2 was re-explored and afterwards rebuilt. Mound 17, a previously undisturbed burial, was found to contain a young man, his weapons and goods, and a separate grave for a horse. A substantial part of the gravefield was left unexcavated for the benefit of future investigators and as yet unknown scientific methods.

=== 21st century ===
In August 2024, archaeologists unearthed more fragments of a Byzantine bucket at Sutton Hoo.

== Exhibition ==


The ship-burial treasure was presented to the nation by the owner, Edith Pretty, and was at the time the largest gift made to the British Museum by a living donor. The principal items are now permanently on display at the British Museum. A display of the original finds excavated in 1938 from Mounds 2, 3 and 4, and replicas of the most important items from Mound 1, can be seen at the Ipswich Museum.

In the 1990s, the Sutton Hoo site, including Sutton Hoo House, was given to the National Trust by the Trustees of the Annie Tranmer Trust. At Sutton Hoo&#x27;s visitor centre and Exhibition Hall, the newly found hanging bowl and the Bromeswell Bucket, finds from the equestrian grave, and a recreation of the burial chamber and its contents can be seen.

The 2001 Visitor Centre was designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects for the National Trust. Their work included the overall planning of the estate, the design of an exhibition hall and visitor facilities, car parking and the restoration of the Edwardian house to provide additional facilities.

The £5m visitor centre was opened in March 2002 by Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney, who had published a translation of &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

<text>St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, formally the , is an Anglican cathedral in London, England, the seat of the Bishop of London. The cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London. Its dedication in honour of Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The high-domed present structure, which was completed in 1710, is a Grade I listed building that was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. The cathedral&#x27;s reconstruction was part of a major rebuilding programme initiated in the aftermath of the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul&#x27;s walk and St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, being the site of St Paul&#x27;s Cross.

The cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren&#x27;s City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world. St Paul&#x27;s is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom, after Liverpool Cathedral.

Services held at St Paul&#x27;s have included the funerals of Admiral Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; an inauguration service for the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer; the launch of the Festival of Britain; and the thanksgiving services for the Silver, Golden, Diamond, and Platinum Jubilees and the 80th and 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II. St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz.
The cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services. The tourist entry fee at the door is £25 for adults (January 2024) but no charges are made to worshippers attending services, or for private prayer.

The nearest London Underground station is St Paul&#x27;s, which is away from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

== History ==
===Before the cathedral===
The location of Londinium&#x27;s original cathedral is unknown, but legend and medieval tradition claims it was St Peter upon Cornhill. St Paul is an unusual attribution for a cathedral, and suggests there was another one in the Roman period. Legends of St Lucius link St Peter upon Cornhill as the centre of the Roman Londinium Christian community. It stands upon the highest point in the area of old Londinium, and it was given pre-eminence in medieval procession on account of the legends. There is, however, no other reliable evidence and the location of the site on the Forum makes it difficult for it to fit the legendary stories. In 1995, a large fifth-century building on Tower Hill was excavated, and has been claimed as a Roman basilica, possibly a cathedral, although this is speculative.

The Elizabethan antiquarian William Camden argued that a temple to the goddess Diana had stood during Roman times on the site occupied by the medieval St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Wren reported that he had found no trace of any such temple during the works to build the new cathedral after the Great Fire, and Camden&#x27;s hypothesis is no longer accepted by modern archaeologists.

===Pre-Norman cathedral===
There is evidence for Christianity in London during the Roman period, but no firm evidence for the location of churches or a cathedral. Bishop Restitutus is said to have represented London at the Council of Arles in 314 AD. A list of the 16 &quot;archbishops&quot; of London was recorded by Jocelyn of Furness in the 12th century, claiming London&#x27;s Christian community was founded in the second century under the legendary King Lucius and his missionary saints Fagan, Deruvian, Elvanus and Medwin. None of that is considered credible by modern historians but, although the surviving text is problematic, either Bishop Restitutus or Adelphius at the 314 Council of Arles seems to have come from Londinium.

Bede records that in AD604 Augustine of Canterbury consecrated Mellitus as the first bishop to the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the East Saxons and their king, Sæberht. Sæberht&#x27;s uncle and overlord, Æthelberht, king of Kent, built a church dedicated to St Paul in London, as the seat of the new bishop. It is assumed, although not proved, that this first Anglo-Saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals. 

On the death of Sæberht in about 616, his pagan sons expelled Mellitus from London, and the East Saxons reverted to paganism. The fate of the first cathedral building is unknown. Christianity was restored among the East Saxons in the late seventh century and it is presumed that either the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was restored or a new building erected as the seat of bishops such as Cedd, Wine and Erkenwald, the last of whom was buried in the cathedral in 693.

Earconwald was consecrated bishop of London in 675, and is said to have bestowed great cost on the fabric, and in later times he almost occupied the place of traditionary, founder: the veneration paid to him is second only to that which was rendered to St. Paul. Erkenwald would become a subject of the important High Medieval poem &quot;St Erkenwald&quot;.

King Æthelred the Unready was buried in the cathedral on his death in 1016; the tomb is now lost. The cathedral was burnt, with much of the city, in a fire in 1087, as recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;.

=== Old St Paul&#x27;s ===

The fourth St Paul&#x27;s, generally referred to as &quot;Old St Paul&#x27;s&quot;, was begun by the Normans after the 1087 fire. A further fire in 1135 disrupted the work, and the new cathedral was not consecrated until 1240. During the period of construction, the style of architecture had changed from Romanesque to Gothic and this was reflected in the pointed arches and larger windows of the upper parts and East End of the building. The Gothic ribbed vault was constructed, like that of York Minster, of wood rather than stone, which affected the ultimate fate of the building.

An enlargement programme commenced in 1256. This &quot;New Work&quot; was consecrated in 1300 but not complete until 1314. During the later Medieval period St Paul&#x27;s was exceeded in length only by the Abbey Church of Cluny and in the height of its spire only by Lincoln Cathedral and St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Stralsund. Excavations by Francis Penrose in 1878 showed that it was long and wide ( across the transepts and crossing). The spire was about in height. By the 16th century the building was deteriorating.

The English Reformation under Henry VIII and Edward VI (accelerated by the Chantries Acts) led to the destruction of elements of the interior ornamentation and the chapels, shrines, and chantries.

The Reformation would come to include the removal of the cathedral&#x27;s collection of relics, which by the sixteenth century was understood to include:

* the body of St Erkenwald 
* both arms of St Mellitus
* a knife thought to belong to Jesus
* hair of Mary Magdalene 
* blood of St Paul
* milk of the Virgin Mary
* the head of St John
* the skull of Thomas Becket
* the head and jaw of King Ethelbert
* part of the wood of the cross, 
* a stone of the Holy Sepulchre, 
* a stone from the spot of the Ascension, and 
* some bones of the eleven thousand virgins of Cologne.
In October 1538, an image of St Erkenwald, probably from the shrine, was delivered to the master of the king&#x27;s jewels. Other images may have survived, at least for a time. More systematic iconoclasm happened in the reign of Edward VI: the &quot;Grey Friar&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; reports that the rood and other images were destroyed in November 1547.

In late 1549, at the height of the iconoclasm of the reformation, Sir Rowland Hill altered the route of his Lord Mayor&#x27;s day procession and said a de profundis at the tomb of Erkenwald. Later in Hill&#x27;s mayoralty of (1550) the high altar of St Paul&#x27;s was removed overnight to be destroyed, an occurrence that provoked a fight in which a man was killed. Hill had ordered, unusually for the time, that St Barnabas&#x27;s Day would not be kept as a public holiday ahead of these events.

Three years later, by October 1553, &quot;Alle the alteres and chappelles in alle Powlles churche&quot; were taken down. In August 1553, the dean and chapter were cited to appear before Queen Mary&#x27;s commissioners.

Some of the buildings in the St Paul&#x27;s churchyard were sold as shops and rental properties, especially to printers and booksellers. In 1561 the spire was destroyed by a lightning strike, an event that Roman Catholic writers claimed was a sign of God&#x27;s judgment on England&#x27;s Protestant rulers. Bishop James Pilkington preached a sermon in response, claiming that the lightning strike was a judgement for the irreverent use of the cathedral building. Immediate steps were taken to repair the damage, with the citizens of London and the clergy offering money to support the rebuilding. However, the cost of repairing the building properly was too great for a country and city recovering from a trade depression. Instead, the roof was repaired and a timber &quot;roo&quot;’ put on the steeple.

In the 1630s a west front was added to the building by England&#x27;s first classical architect, Inigo Jones. There was much defacing and mistreatment of the building by Parliamentarian forces during the Civil War, and the old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed. During the Commonwealth, those churchyard buildings that were razed supplied ready-dressed building material for construction projects, such as the Lord Protector&#x27;s city palace, Somerset House. Crowds were drawn to the north-east corner of the churchyard, St Paul&#x27;s Cross, where open-air preaching took place.

In the Great Fire of London of 1666, Old St Paul&#x27;s was gutted. While it might have been possible to reconstruct it, a decision was taken to build a new cathedral in a modern style. This course of action had been proposed even before the fire.

=== Present St Paul&#x27;s ===

The task of designing a replacement structure was officially assigned to Sir Christopher Wren on 30 July 1669. He had previously been put in charge of the rebuilding of churches to replace those lost in the Great Fire. More than 50 city churches are attributable to Wren. Concurrent with designing St Paul&#x27;s, Wren was engaged in the production of his five &quot;Tracts&quot; on Architecture.

Wren had begun advising on the repair of the &quot;Old St Paul&#x27;s&quot; in 1661, five years before the fire in 1666. The proposed work included renovations to interior and exterior to complement the classical facade designed by Inigo Jones in 1630. Wren planned to replace the dilapidated tower with a dome, using the existing structure as a scaffold. He produced a drawing of the proposed dome which shows his idea that it should span nave and aisles at the crossing. After the Fire, it was at first thought possible to retain a substantial part of the old cathedral, but ultimately the entire structure was demolished in the early 1670s.

In July 1668 Dean William Sancroft wrote to Wren that he was charged by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in agreement with the Bishops of London and Oxford, to design a new cathedral that was &quot;Handsome and noble to all the ends of it and to the reputation of the City and the nation&quot;. The design process took several years, but a design was finally settled and attached to a royal warrant, with the proviso that Wren was permitted to make any further changes that he deemed necessary. The result was the present St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, still the second largest church in Britain, with a dome proclaimed as the finest in the world. The building was financed by a tax on coal, and was completed within its architect&#x27;s lifetime with many of the major contractors engaged for the duration.

The &quot;topping out&quot; of the cathedral (when the final stone was placed on the lantern) took place on 26 October 1708, performed by Wren&#x27;s son Christopher Jr and the son of one of the masons. The cathedral was declared officially complete by Parliament on 25 December 1711 (Christmas Day). In fact, construction continued for several years after that, with the statues on the roof added in the 1720s. In 1716 the total costs amounted to £1,095,556 (£ in ).

==== Consecration ====
On 2 December 1697, 31 years and 3 months after the Great Fire destroyed Old St Paul&#x27;s, the new cathedral was consecrated for use. The Right Reverend Henry Compton, Bishop of London, preached the sermon. It was based on the text of Psalm 122, &quot;I was glad when they said unto me: Let us go into the house of the Lord.&quot; The first regular service was held on the following Sunday.

Opinions of Wren&#x27;s cathedral differed, with some loving it: &quot;Without, within, below, above, the eye / Is filled with unrestrained delight&quot;, while others hated it: &quot;There was an air of Popery about the gilded capitals, the heavy arches ... They were unfamiliar, un-English ...&quot;.

=== Since 1900 ===

====Suffragette terror attacks====

St. Paul&#x27;s was the target of two suffragette bombing attacks in 1913 and 1914 respectively. This was as part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign between 1912 and 1914, in which suffragettes from the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, as part of their campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage, carried out a series of politically motivated bombings and arson nationwide. Churches were explicitly targeted by the suffragettes as they believed the Church of England was complicit in reinforcing opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage. Between 1913 and 1914, 32 churches across Britain were attacked.

The first attack on St. Paul&#x27;s occurred on 8 May 1913, at the start of a sermon. A bomb was heard ticking and discovered as people were entering the cathedral. It was made out of potassium nitrate. Had it exploded, the bomb likely would have destroyed the historic bishop&#x27;s throne and other parts of the cathedral. The remains of the device, which was made partly out of a mustard tin, are now on display at the City of London Police Museum.

A second bombing of the cathedral by the suffragettes was attempted on 13 June 1914, however the bomb was again discovered before it could explode. This attempted bombing occurred two days after a bomb had exploded at Westminster Abbey, which damaged the Coronation Chair and caused a mass panic for the exits. Several other churches were bombed at this time, such as St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square and the Metropolitan Tabernacle.

==== The Great Restoration ====
Early in the 20th century, concerns were raised about the effects of settlement on the dome and the piers supporting it, confirmed by surveyors reports in 1913 and 1914. An appeal for £70,000 allowed two of the piers to be reinforced, despite delays caused by the First World War. A second appeal for £100,000 in 1922 allowed the work to continue, but on Christmas Eve 1924, a Dangerous Structures Notice was served on the cathedral by the City Corporation. Starting in March 1925, concrete and more than 250 steel bars were inserted into the piers, while a great steel chain was embedded around the outside of the dome to stabilise it. The high altar was moved to the nave and the organ was rebuilt in the north aisle so that worship could continue while work went on behind a screen. When the work was finally completed, a grand rededication service was held on 25 June 1930; it was attended by King George V and Queen Mary, and featured a procession of the 220 men who had worked on the restoration. The service was broadcast on BBC Radio, the first time that worship had been broadcast from the cathedral, as it had previously been opposed by the Dean and Chapter.
==== War damage ====

The cathedral survived the Blitz although struck by bombs on 10 October 1940 and 17 April 1941. The first strike destroyed the high altar, while the second strike on the north transept left a hole in the floor above the crypt. The latter bomb is believed to have detonated in the upper interior above the north transept and the force was sufficient to shift the entire dome laterally by a small amount.

On 12 September 1940 a time-delayed bomb that had struck the cathedral was successfully defused and removed by a bomb disposal detachment of Royal Engineers under the command of Temporary Lieutenant Robert Davies. Had this bomb detonated, it would have totally destroyed the cathedral; it left a crater when later remotely detonated in a secure location. As a result of this action, Davies and Sapper George Cameron Wylie were each awarded the George Cross. Davies&#x27; George Cross and other medals are on display at the Imperial War Museum, London.

One of the best known images of London during the war was a photograph of St Paul&#x27;s taken on 29 December 1940 during the &quot;Second Great Fire of London&quot; by photographer Herbert Mason, from the roof of a building in Tudor Street showing the cathedral shrouded in smoke. Lisa Jardine of Queen Mary, University of London, has written:

==== Post-war ====
A considerable amount of rebuilding and restoration of war damage was undertaken in the 1950s and 1960s; including the high altar and American Memorial Chapel completed in 1958, the damaged North Transept in 1962, the cleaning of the west front in 1961-1963, the repair of damage to the dome from anti-aircraft fire completed in 1967 and the building of a new choir school building in 1967.

On 29 July 1981, the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer was held at the cathedral. The couple selected St Paul&#x27;s over Westminster Abbey, the traditional site of royal weddings, because the cathedral offered more seating.

Extensive copper, lead and slate renovation work was carried out on the Dome in 1996 by John B. Chambers. A 15-year restoration project—one of the largest ever undertaken in the UK—was completed on 15 June 2011.

==== Occupy London ====
In October 2011 an anti-capitalism Occupy London encampment was established in front of the cathedral, after failing to gain access to the London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square nearby. The cathedral&#x27;s finances were affected by the ensuing closure. It was claimed that the cathedral was losing revenue of £20,000 per day. Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser resigned, asserting his view that &quot;evicting the anti-capitalist activists would constitute violence in the name of the Church&quot;. The Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, the Right Revd Graeme Knowles, then resigned too. The encampment was evicted at the end of February 2012, by court order and without violence, as a result of legal action by the City of London Corporation.

==== 2019 terrorist plot ====
On 10 October 2019, Safiyya Amira Shaikh, a Muslim convert, was arrested following an MI5 and Metropolitan Police investigation. In September 2019, she had taken photos of the cathedral&#x27;s interior. While trying to radicalise others using the Telegram messaging software, she planned to attack the cathedral and other targets such as a hotel and a train station using explosives. Shaikh pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

==National events==
The size and location of St Paul&#x27;s has made it an ideal setting for Christian services marking great national events. The opportunity for long processions culminating in the dramatic approach up Ludgate Hill, the open area and steps at the west front, the great nave and the space under the dome are all well suited for ceremonial occasions. St Paul&#x27;s can seat many more people than any other church in London, and in past centuries, the erection of temporary wooden galleries inside allowed for congregations exceeding 10,000. In 1935, the dean, Walter Matthews, wrote:

National events attended by the royal family, government ministers and officers of state include national services of thanksgiving, state funerals and a royal wedding. Some of the most notable examples are:

* Thanksgiving service for the Acts of Union 1707, 1 May 1707
* State funeral of Horatio Nelson, 9 January 1806
* State funeral of the Duke of Wellington, 18 November 1852
* Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, 22 June 1897
* Thanksgiving service for the Treaty of Versailles, 6 July 1919
* Silver Jubilee of George V, 6 May 1935
* Thanksgiving services for VE Day and VJ Day, 13 May and 19 August 1945
* State funeral of Winston Churchill, 30 January 1965
* Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 7 June 1977
* Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, 29 July 1981
* Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 4 June 2002
* Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 5 June 2012
* Ceremonial funeral of Margaret Thatcher, 17 April 2013
* Thanksgiving service for the Queen&#x27;s 90th Birthday, 10 June 2016
* Platinum Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving, 3 June 2022

== Ministry and functions ==
St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is a busy church with four or five services every day, including Matins, Eucharist and Evening Prayer or Choral Evensong. In addition, the cathedral has many special services associated with the City of London, its corporation, guilds and institutions. The cathedral, as the largest church in London, also has a role in many state functions such as the service celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The cathedral is generally open daily to tourists and has a regular programme of organ recitals and other performances. The Bishop of London is Sarah Mullally, whose appointment was announced in December 2017 and whose enthronement took place in May 2018.

=== Dean and chapter ===

The cathedral chapter is currently composed of seven individuals: the dean, three residentiary canons (one of whom is, exceptionally, lay), one &quot;additional member of chapter and canon non-residentiary&quot; (ordained), and two lay canons. Each has a different responsibility in the running of the cathedral. As of October 2022:

* Dean: Andrew Tremlett (since 25 September 2022)
* Precentor: vacant 
* Treasurer: vacant
* Chancellor: Paula Gooder (since 9 May 2019; lay reader since 23 February 2019)
* Steward: Neil Evans (since June 2022)
* Additional member of chapter and canon non-residentiary: Sheila Watson (since January 2017).
* Lay Canon: Pamela (Pim) Jane Baxter (since March 2014). Deputy Director at the National Portrait Gallery, with experience in opera, theatre and the visual arts.
* Lay Canon: Sheila Nicoll (since October 2018). She is Head of Public Policy at Schroder Investment Management.
* Lay Canon: Clement Hutton-Mills (since March 2021). He is also a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs. 
* Lay Canon: Gillian Bowen (since June 2022). She is Chief Executive Officer of YMCA London City and North and is a magistrate.

=== Minor canons and priest vicar ===
=== Director of Music ===
The Director of Music is Andrew Carwood. Carwood was appointed to succeed Malcolm Archer as Director of Music, taking up the post in September 2007. He is the first non-organist to hold the post since the 12th century.

====Organs====

An organ was commissioned from Bernard Smith in 1694.

In 1862 the organ from the Panopticon of Science and Art (the Panopticon Organ) was installed in a gallery over the south transept door.

The Grand Organ was completed in 1872, and the Panopticon Organ moved to the Victoria Rooms in Clifton in 1873.

The Grand Organ is the fifth-largest in Great Britain, in terms of number of pipes (7,256), with 5 manuals, 136 ranks of pipes and 137 stops, principally enclosed in an impressive case designed in Wren&#x27;s workshop and decorated by Grinling Gibbons.

Details of the organ can be found online at the National Pipe Organ Register.

=== Choir ===
St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral has a full professional choir, which sings regularly at services. The earliest records of the choir date from 1127. The choir historically consisted of up to 30 boy choristers, eight probationers and vicars choral of 12 professional male singers.

In February 2017 the cathedral announced the appointment of the first female vicar choral, Carris Jones (a mezzo-soprano), to take up the role in September 2017.

During 2022, St Paul’s Cathedral announced that it would admit girls to its choir, breaking a tradition stretching back 900 years. On 30 June 2024, when two girls formally joined the Cathedral Choir as full choristers, having undertaken specialist training in preparation, the Sunday Choral Evensong service officially marked this historic event.

During school terms the choir sings Evensong six times per week, the service on Mondays being sung by a visiting choir (or occasionally said) and that on Thursdays being sung by the vicars choral alone. On Sundays the choir also sings at Mattins and the 11:30 am Eucharist.

Many distinguished musicians have been organists, choir masters and choristers at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, including the composers John Redford, Thomas Morley, John Blow, Jeremiah Clarke, Maurice Greene and John Stainer, while well-known performers have included Alfred Deller, John Shirley-Quirk and Anthony Way as well as the conductors Charles Groves and Paul Hillier and the poet Walter de la Mare.

== Wren&#x27;s cathedral ==
=== Development of the design ===

In designing St Paul&#x27;s, Christopher Wren had to meet many challenges. He had to create a fitting cathedral to replace &quot;Old St Paul&#x27;s&quot;, as a place of worship and as a landmark within the City of London. He had to satisfy the requirements of the church and the tastes of a royal patron, as well as respecting the essentially medieval tradition of English church building which developed to accommodate the liturgy. Wren was familiar with contemporary Renaissance and Baroque trends in Italian architecture and had visited France, where he studied the work of François Mansart.

Wren&#x27;s design developed through five general stages. The first survives only as a single drawing and part of a model. The scheme (usually called the &quot;First Model Design&quot;) appears to have consisted of a circular domed vestibule (possibly based on the Pantheon in Rome) and a rectangular church of basilica form. The plan may have been influenced by the Temple Church. It was rejected because it was not thought &quot;stately enough&quot;. Wren&#x27;s second design was a Greek cross, which was thought by the clerics not to fulfil the requirements of Anglican liturgy.

Wren&#x27;s third design is embodied in the &quot;Great Model&quot; of 1673. The model, made of oak and plaster, cost over £500 (approximately £32,000 today) and is over tall and long. This design retained the form of the Greek-Cross design but extended it with a nave. His critics, members of a committee commissioned to rebuild the church, and clergy decried the design as too dissimilar to other English churches to suggest any continuity within the Church of England. Another problem was that the entire design would have to be completed all at once because of the eight central piers that supported the dome, instead of being completed in stages and opened for use before construction finished, as was customary. The Great Model was Wren&#x27;s favourite design; he thought it a reflection of Renaissance beauty. After the Great Model, Wren resolved not to make further models and not to expose his drawings publicly, which he found did nothing but &quot;lose time, and subject [his] business many times, to incompetent judges&quot;. The Great Model survives and is housed within the cathedral itself.

Wren&#x27;s fourth design is known as the &quot;Warrant design&quot; because it received a Royal warrant for the rebuilding. In this design Wren sought to reconcile Gothic, the predominant style of English churches, to a &quot;better manner of architecture&quot;. It has the longitudinal Latin Cross plan of a medieval cathedral. It is of storeys and has classical porticos at the west and transept ends, influenced by Inigo Jones&#x27;s addition to Old St Paul&#x27;s. It is roofed at the crossing by a wide shallow dome supporting a drum with a second cupola, from which rises a spire of seven diminishing stages. Vaughan Hart has suggested that influence in the design of the spire may have been drawn from the oriental pagoda. Not used at St Paul&#x27;s, the concept was applied in the spire of St Bride&#x27;s, Fleet Street. This plan was rotated slightly on its site so that it aligned, not with true east, but with sunrise on Easter of the year construction began. This small change in configuration was informed by Wren&#x27;s knowledge of astronomy.
=== Final design ===
The final design as built differs substantially from the official Warrant design. Wren received permission from the king to make &quot;ornamental changes&quot; to the submitted design, and Wren took great advantage of this. Many of these changes were made over the course of the thirty years as the church was constructed, and the most significant was to the dome: &quot;He raised another structure over the first cupola, a cone of brick, so as to support a stone lantern of an elegant figure ... And he covered and hid out of sight the brick cone with another cupola of timber and lead; and between this and the cone are easy stairs that ascend to the lantern&quot; (Christopher Wren, son of Sir Christopher Wren). The final design was strongly rooted in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. The saucer domes over the nave were inspired by François Mansart&#x27;s Church of the Val-de-Grâce, which Wren had seen during a trip to Paris in 1665.

The date of the laying of the first stone of the cathedral is disputed. One contemporary account says it was 21 June 1675, another 25 June and a third on 28 June. There is, however, general agreement that it was laid in June 1675. Edward Strong later claimed it was laid by his elder brother, Thomas Strong, one of the two master stonemasons appointed by Wren at the beginning of the work.

=== Structural engineering ===
Wren&#x27;s challenge was to construct a large cathedral on the relatively weak clay soil of London. St Paul&#x27;s is unusual among cathedrals in that there is a crypt, the largest in Europe, under the entire building rather than just under the eastern end. The crypt serves a structural purpose. Although it is extensive, half the space of the crypt is taken up by massive piers which spread the weight of the much slimmer piers of the church above. While the towers and domes of most cathedrals are supported on four piers, Wren designed the dome of St Paul&#x27;s to be supported on eight, achieving a broader distribution of weight at the level of the foundations. The foundations settled as the building progressed, and Wren made structural changes in response.

One of the design problems that confronted Wren was to create a landmark dome, tall enough to visually replace the lost tower of St Paul&#x27;s, while at the same time appearing visually satisfying when viewed from inside the building. Wren planned a double-shelled dome, as at St Peter&#x27;s Basilica. His solution to the visual problem was to separate the heights of the inner and outer dome to a much greater extent than had been done by Michelangelo at St Peter&#x27;s, drafting both as catenary curves, rather than as hemispheres. Between the inner and outer domes, Wren inserted a brick cone which supports both the timbers of the outer, lead-covered dome and the weight of the ornate stone lantern that rises above it. Both the cone and the inner dome are 18 inches thick and are supported by wrought iron chains at intervals in the brick cone and around the cornice of the peristyle of the inner dome to prevent spreading and cracking.

The Warrant Design showed external buttresses on the ground floor level. These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The clerestory and vault are reinforced with flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength. These are concealed behind the screen wall of the upper story, which was added to keep the building&#x27;s classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters the thrust of the buttresses on the lower walls.

=== Designers, builders and craftsmen ===
During the extensive period of design and rationalisation, Wren employed from 1684 Nicholas Hawksmoor as his principal assistant. Between 1696 and 1711 William Dickinson was measuring clerk. Joshua Marshall (until his early death in 1678) and Thomas and his brother Edward Strong were master masons, the latter two working on the construction for its entirety. John Langland was the master carpenter for over thirty years. Grinling Gibbons was the chief sculptor, working in both stone on the building itself, including the pediment of the north portal, and wood on the internal fittings. The sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber created the pediment of the south transept while Francis Bird was responsible for the relief in the west pediment depicting the &quot;Conversion of St Paul&quot;, as well as the seven large statues on the west front. The floor was paved by William Dickinson in black and white marble in 1709–10 Jean Tijou was responsible for the decorative wrought ironwork of gates and balustrades. The ball and cross on the dome were provided by an armorer, Andrew Niblett. Following the war damage mentioned above, many craftsmen were employed to restore the wood carvings and stone work that had been destroyed by the bomb impact. One of particular note is Master Carver, Gino Masero who was commissioned to carve the replacement figure of Christ, an eight-foot sculpture in lime which currently stands on the High Altar.

== Description ==

St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is built in a restrained Baroque style which represents Wren&#x27;s rationalisation of the traditions of English medieval cathedrals with the inspiration of Palladio, the classical style of Inigo Jones, the baroque style of 17th century Rome, and the buildings by Mansart and others that he had seen in France. It is particularly in its plan that St Paul&#x27;s reveals medieval influences. Like the great medieval cathedrals of York and Winchester, St Paul&#x27;s is comparatively long for its width, and has strongly projecting transepts. It has much emphasis on its facade, which has been designed to define rather than conceal the form of the building behind it. In plan, the towers jut beyond the width of the aisles as they do at Wells Cathedral. Wren&#x27;s uncle Matthew Wren was the Bishop of Ely, and, having worked for his uncle, Wren was familiar with the unique octagonal lantern tower over the crossing of Ely Cathedral, which spans the aisles as well as the central nave, unlike the central towers and domes of most churches. Wren adapted this characteristic in designing the dome of St Paul&#x27;s. In section St Paul&#x27;s also maintains a medieval form, having the aisles much lower than the nave, and a defined clerestory.

=== Exterior ===
The most renowned exterior feature is the dome, which rises to the cross at its summit, and dominates views of the city. The height of 365 feet is explained by Wren&#x27;s interest in astronomy. Until the late 20th century St Paul&#x27;s was the tallest building on the City skyline, designed to be seen surrounded by the delicate spires of Wren&#x27;s other city churches. The dome is described by Sir Banister Fletcher as &quot;probably the finest in Europe&quot;, by Helen Gardner as &quot;majestic&quot;, and by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;one of the most perfect in the world&quot;. Sir John Summerson said that Englishmen and &quot;even some foreigners&quot; consider it to be without equal.

==== Dome ====
Wren drew inspiration from Michelangelo&#x27;s dome of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and that of Mansart&#x27;s Church of the Val-de-Grâce, which he had visited. Unlike those of St Peter&#x27;s and Val-de-Grâce, the dome of St Paul&#x27;s rises in two clearly defined storeys of masonry, which, together with a lower unadorned footing, equal a height of about 95 feet. From the time of the &quot;Greek Cross Design&quot; it is clear that Wren favoured a continuous colonnade (&quot;peristyle&quot;) around the drum of the dome, rather than the arrangement of alternating windows and projecting columns that Michelangelo had used and which had also been employed by Mansart. Summerson suggests that he was influenced by Bramante&#x27;s &quot;Tempietto&quot; in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio. In the finished structure, Wren creates a diversity and appearance of strength by placing niches between the columns in every fourth opening. The peristyle serves to buttress both the inner dome and the brick cone which rises internally to support the lantern.

Above the peristyle rises the second stage surrounded by a balustraded balcony called the &quot;Stone Gallery&quot;. This attic stage is ornamented with alternating pilasters and rectangular windows which are set just below the cornice, creating a sense of lightness. Above this attic rises the dome, covered with lead, and ribbed in accordance with the spacing of the pilasters. It is pierced by eight light wells just below the lantern, but these are barely visible. They allow light to penetrate through openings in the brick cone, which illuminates the interior apex of this shell, partly visible from within the cathedral through the ocular opening of the lower dome.

The lantern, like the visible masonry of the dome, rises in stages. The most unusual characteristic of this structure is that it is of square plan, rather than circular or octagonal. The tallest stage takes the form of a &quot;tempietto&quot; with four columned porticos facing the cardinal points. Its lowest level is surrounded by the &quot;Golden Gallery&quot; and its upper level supports a small dome from which rises a cross on a golden ball. The total weight of the lantern is about 850 tons.

==== West front ====
For the Renaissance architect designing the west front of a large church or cathedral, the universal problem was how to use a facade to unite the high central nave with the lower aisles in a visually harmonious whole. Since Alberti&#x27;s additions to Santa Maria Novella in Florence, this was usually achieved by the simple expedient of linking the sides to the centre with large brackets. This is the solution that Wren saw employed by Mansart at Val-de-Grâce. Another feature employed by Mansart was a boldly projecting Classical portico with paired columns. Wren faced the additional challenge of incorporating towers into the design, as had been planned at St Peter&#x27;s Basilica. At St Peter&#x27;s, Carlo Maderno had solved this problem by constructing a narthex and stretching a huge screen facade across it, differentiated at the centre by a pediment. The towers at St Peter&#x27;s were not built above the parapet.

Wren&#x27;s solution was to employ a Classical portico, as at Val-de-Grâce, but rising through two storeys, and supported on paired columns. The remarkable feature here is that the lower story of this portico extends to the full width of the aisles, while the upper section defines the nave that lies behind it. The gaps between the upper stage of the portico and the towers on either side are bridged by a narrow section of wall with an arch-topped window.

The towers stand outside the width of the aisles, but screen two chapels located immediately behind them. The lower parts of the towers continue the theme of the outer walls, but are differentiated from them in order to create an appearance of strength. The windows of the lower story are smaller than those of the side walls and are deeply recessed, a visual indication of the thickness of the wall. The paired pilasters at each corner project boldly.

Above the main cornice, which unites the towers with the portico and the outer walls, the details are boldly scaled, in order to read well from the street below and from a distance. The towers rise above the cornice from a square block plinth which is plain apart from large oculi, that on the south being filled by the clock, while that on the north is void. The towers are composed of two complementary elements, a central cylinder rising through the tiers in a series of stacked drums, and paired Corinthian columns at the corners, with buttresses above them, which serve to unify the drum shape with the square plinth on which it stands. The entablature above the columns breaks forward over them to express both elements, tying them together in a single horizontal band. The cap, an ogee-shaped dome, supports a gilded finial in the form of a pineapple.

The transepts each have a semi-circular entrance portico. Wren was inspired in the design by studying engravings of Pietro da Cortona&#x27;s Baroque facade of Santa Maria della Pace in Rome. These projecting arcs echo the shape of the apse at the eastern end of the building.

==== Walls ====
The building is of two storeys of ashlar masonry, above a basement, and surrounded by a balustrade above the upper cornice. The balustrade was added, against Wren&#x27;s wishes, in 1718. The internal bays are marked externally by paired pilasters with Corinthian capitals at the lower level and Composite at the upper level. Where the building behind is of only one story (at the aisles of both nave and choir) the upper story of the exterior wall is sham. It serves a dual purpose of supporting the buttresses of the vault, and providing a satisfying appearance when viewed rising above buildings of the height of the 17th-century city. This appearance may still be seen from across the River Thames.

Between the pilasters on both levels are windows. Those of the lower storey have semi-circular heads and are surrounded by continuous mouldings of a Roman style, rising to decorative keystones. Beneath each window is a floral swag by Grinling Gibbons, constituting the finest stone carving on the building and some of the greatest architectural sculpture in England. A frieze with similar swags runs in a band below the cornice, tying the arches of the windows and the capitals. The upper windows are of a restrained Classical form, with pediments set on columns, but are blind and contain niches. Beneath these niches, and in the basement level, are small windows with segmental tops, the glazing of which catches the light and visually links them to the large windows of the aisles. The height from ground level to the top of the parapet is approximately 110 feet.

==== Fencing ====

The original fencing, designed by Wren, was dismantled in the 1870s. The surveyor for the government of Toronto had it shipped to Toronto, where it has since adorned High Park.

=== Interior ===
Internally, St Paul&#x27;s has a nave and choir in each of its three bays. The entrance from the west portico is through a square domed narthex, flanked by chapels: the Chapel of St Dunstan to the north and the Chapel of the Order of St Michael and St George to the south. The nave is in height and is separated from the aisles by an arcade of piers with attached Corinthian pilasters rising to an entablature. The bays, and therefore the vault compartments, are rectangular, but Wren roofed these spaces with saucer-shaped domes and surrounded the clerestory windows with lunettes. The vaults of the choir are decorated with mosaics by Sir William Blake Richmond. The dome and the apse of the choir are all approached through wide arches with coffered vaults which contrast with the smooth surface of the domes and punctuate the division between the main spaces. The transepts extend to the north and south of the dome and are called (in this instance) the North Choir and the South Choir.

The choir holds the stalls for the clergy, cathedral officers and the choir, and the organ. These wooden fittings, including the pulpit and Bishop&#x27;s throne, were designed in Wren&#x27;s office and built by joiners. The carvings are the work of Grinling Gibbons whom Summerson describes as having &quot;astonishing facility&quot;, suggesting that Gibbons aim was to reproduce popular Dutch flower painting in wood. Jean Tijou, a French metalworker, provided various wrought iron and gilt grilles, gates and balustrades of elaborate design, of which many pieces have now been combined into the gates near the sanctuary.

The cathedral is some in length (including the portico of the Great West Door), of which is the nave and is the choir.
The width of the nave is and across the transepts is . The cathedral is slightly shorter but somewhat wider than Old St Paul&#x27;s.

==== Dome ====
The main internal space of the cathedral is that under the central dome which extends the full width of the nave and aisles. The dome is supported on pendentives rising between eight arches spanning the nave, choir, transepts, and aisles. The eight piers that carry them are not evenly spaced. Wren has maintained an appearance of eight equal spans by inserting segmental arches to carry galleries across the ends of the aisles, and has extended the mouldings of the upper arch to appear equal to the wider arches.

Above the keystones of the arches, at above the floor and wide, runs a cornice which supports the &quot;Whispering Gallery&quot; so called because of its acoustic properties: a whisper or low murmur against its wall at any point is audible to a listener with an ear held to the wall at any other point around the gallery. It is reached by 259 steps from ground level.

The dome is raised on a tall drum surrounded by pilasters and pierced with windows in groups of three, separated by eight gilded niches containing statues, and repeating the pattern of the peristyle on the exterior. The dome rises above a gilded cornice at to a height of . Its painted decoration by Sir James Thornhill shows eight scenes from the life of St Paul set in illusionistic architecture which continues the forms of the eight niches of the drum. At the apex of the dome is an oculus inspired by that of the Pantheon in Rome. Through this hole can be seen the decorated inner surface of the cone which supports the lantern. This upper space is lit by the light wells in the outer dome and openings in the brick cone. Engravings of Thornhill&#x27;s paintings were published in 1720.

==== Apse ====
The eastern apse extends the width of the choir and is the full height of the main arches across choir and nave. It is decorated with mosaics, in keeping with the choir vaults. The original reredos and high altar were destroyed by bombing in 1940. The present high altar and baldacchino are the work of W. Godfrey Allen and Stephen Dykes Bower. The apse was dedicated in 1958 as the American Memorial Chapel. It was paid for entirely by donations from British people. The Roll of Honour contains the names of more than 28,000 Americans who gave their lives while on their way to, or stationed in, the United Kingdom during the Second World War. It is in front of the chapel&#x27;s altar. The three windows of the apse date from 1960 and depict themes of service and sacrifice, while the insignia around the edges represent the American states and the US armed forces. The limewood panelling incorporates a rocket—a tribute to America&#x27;s achievements in space.

=== Artworks, tombs and memorials ===

St Paul&#x27;s, at the time of its completion, was adorned by sculpture in stone and wood: most notably that of Grinling Gibbons, by the paintings in the dome by Thornhill, and by Jean Tijou&#x27;s elaborate metalwork. It has been further enhanced by Sir William Richmond&#x27;s mosaics and the fittings by Dykes Bower and Godfrey Allen. Other artworks in the cathedral include, in the south aisle, William Holman Hunt&#x27;s copy of his painting &quot;The Light of the World&quot;, the original of which hangs in Keble College, Oxford. The St. Paul&#x27;s version was completed with a significant input from Edward Robert Hughes as Hunt was now suffering from glaucoma. In the north choir aisle is a limestone sculpture of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by Henry Moore, carved in 1943. The crypt contains over 200 memorials and numerous burials. Christopher Wren was the first person to be interred, in 1723. On the wall above his tomb in the crypt is written in Latin: &quot;Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice&quot; (&quot;Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you&quot;).
The largest monument in the cathedral is that to the Duke of Wellington by Alfred Stevens. It stands on the north side of the nave and has on top a statue of Wellington astride his horse &quot;Copenhagen&quot;. Although the equestrian figure was planned at the outset, objections to the notion of having a horse in the church prevented its installation until 1912. The horse and rider are by John Tweed. The Duke is buried in the crypt.
The tomb of Horatio, Lord Nelson is located in the crypt, next to that of Wellington. The marble sarcophagus which holds Nelson&#x27;s remains was made for Cardinal Wolsey but not used as the cardinal had fallen from favour. At the eastern end of the crypt is the Chapel of the Order of the British Empire, instigated in 1917, and designed by John Seely, Lord Mottistone. There are many other memorials commemorating the British military, including several lists of servicemen who died in action, the most recent being the Gulf War.

Also remembered are Florence Nightingale, J. M. W. Turner, Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, Samuel Johnson, Lawrence of Arabia, William Blake, William Jones and Sir Alexander Fleming as well as clergy and residents of the local parish. There are lists of the Bishops and cathedral Deans for the last thousand years. One of the most remarkable sculptures is that of the Dean and poet, John Donne. Before his death, Donne posed for his own memorial statue and was depicted by Nicholas Stone as wrapped in a burial shroud, and standing on a funeral urn. The sculpture, carved around 1630, is the only one to have survived the conflagration of 1666 intact. The treasury is also in the crypt but the cathedral has very few treasures as many have been lost, and on 22 December 1810 a major robbery took almost all of the remaining precious artefacts.

The funerals of many notable figures have been held in the cathedral, including those of Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill, George Mallory and Margaret Thatcher.

The East India Company Trail at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral

In 2023, following nationwide discussions over the status and value of memorial statues celebrating the lives of individuals involved with the British Empire, including slavery, the St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral initiated a partnership with Stepney Community Trust, a community-led charity based out of the East End of London. A group of volunteers were recruited to help historically situated the many memorial statues inside St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, whose careers, actions and views were associated with historic harm done to communities in South Asia. The project entailed writing explanatory texts that situated the highly eulogistic statues in their wider historical context. These texts are now available on the website of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, on dedicated webpages titled The East India Company at St. Paul&#x27;s.

Memorials thus contextualised include the statue of Charles George Gordon, the statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the statue of Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo, the statue of Bishop Thomas Fanshaw Middleton, the statue of Granville Gower Loch, the statue of William Jones, the statue of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, the statue of Henry Montgomery Lawrence, the statue of Henry Bartle Frere, the statue of Robert Cornelius Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala, the statue of Charles James Napier, the statue of Charles Metcalfe Macgregor, the statue of Samuel James Browne, the statue of Harry Smith Parkes and the memorial to Indian Army Volunteers. The trail has a printed guide that visitors may use, and the statues on the trail are identifiable by a graphic and a QR code which leads to the relevant webpage upon scanning. The graphic is original artwork produced by graphic design artist Sonal Agarwal, and represents a cluster of statues of South Asian persons, men and women, who currently serve as decorative or supportive features of the main statues. 
=== Clock ===
A clock was installed in the south-west tower by Langley Bradley in 1709 but was worn out by the end of the 19th century. The present mechanism was built in 1893 by Smith of Derby incorporating a design of escapement by Edmund Denison Beckett similar to that used by Edward Dent on Big Ben&#x27;s mechanism in 1895. The clock mechanism is long and is the most recent of the clocks introduced to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral over the centuries. Since 1969 the clock has been electrically wound with equipment designed and installed by Smith of Derby, relieving the clock custodian from the work of cranking up the heavy drive weights.

==== Great Paul ====
The south-west tower also contains four bells, of which Great Paul, cast in 1881 by J. W. Taylor of Taylor&#x27;s bell foundry of Loughborough, at was the largest bell in the British Isles until the casting of the Olympic Bell for the 2012 London Olympics. Although the bell is traditionally sounded at 1 pm each day, Great Paul had not been rung for several years because of a broken chiming mechanism. In the 1970s the fastening mechanism that secured the clapper had fractured, sending both through the clock mechanism below and causing damage which cost £30,000 to repair. In about 1989 the clapper fractured completely, although less damage was sustained. On 31 July 2021, during the London Festival of the Bells, Great Paul rang for the first time in two decades, being hand swung by the bell ringers.

==== Great Tom ====
The clock bells include Great Tom, which was moved from St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel at the Palace of Westminster and has been recast several times, the last time by Richard Phelps. It chimes the hour and is traditionally tolled on occasions of a death in the royal family, the Bishop of London, or the Lord Mayor of London, although an exception was made at the death of the US president James Garfield. It was last tolled for the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, ringing once every minute along with other bells across the country in honour of the 96 years of her life.

==== Quarter-jacks ====
In 1717, Richard Phelps cast two more bells that were added as &quot;quarter jacks&quot; that ring on the quarter hour. Still in use today, the first weighs , is in diameter and is tuned to A; the second weighs , is in diameter and is tuned to E. They are sometimes known as Ding and Dong due to the way they sound.

=== Bells ===

The north-west tower contains 13 bells. A ring of 12 bells by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough hung for change ringing, and the single communion bell. In January 2018 the bells were removed for refurbishment and were rehung in September that year, being rung again for the first time on All Saints&#x27; Day. The original service or &quot;Communion&quot; bell dating from 1700 and known as &quot;the Banger&quot; is rung before 8 a.m. services.

== Education, tourism and the arts ==
=== Interpretation Project ===
The Interpretation Project was a long-term project concerned with bringing St Paul&#x27;s to life for all its visitors. In 2010, the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s opened St Paul&#x27;s Oculus, a 270° film experience that brings 1400 years of history to life. It was located in the former Treasury in the crypt, the film took visitors on a journey through the history and daily life of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Oculus was funded by American Express Company in partnership with the World Monuments Fund, J. P. Morgan, the Garfield Weston Trust for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the City of London Endowment Trust and AIG. It was closed by 2020. The Treasury space is now used for changing exhibitions.

In 2010, touchscreen multimedia guides were launched. These guides are included in the price of admission. Visitors can discover the cathedral&#x27;s history, architecture and daily life of a busy working church with these new multimedia guides. They are available in 12 different languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and British Sign Language (BSL). The guides have fly-through videos of the dome galleries and zoomable close-ups of the ceiling mosaics, painting and photography. Interviews and commentary from experts include the Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, conservation team and the Director of Music. Archive film footage includes major services and events from the cathedral&#x27;s history.

==== Charges for sightseers ====
St Paul&#x27;s charges an entrance fee for sightseers, admission to worship services is free. The entrance ticket is £25 for adults (June 2024). Outside service times, people seeking a quiet place to pray or worship are admitted to St Dunstan&#x27;s Chapel free of charge. On Sundays people are admitted only for services and concerts and there is no sightseeing. The charge to sightseers is made because St Paul&#x27;s receives little regular or significant funding from the Crown, the Church of England or the state and relies on the income generated by tourism to allow the building to continue to function as a centre for Christian worship, as well as to cover general maintenance and repair work.

=== St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Arts Project ===

The St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Arts Project explores art and faith. Projects have included installations by Gerry Judah, Antony Gormley, Rebecca Horn, Yoko Ono and Martin Firrell.

In 2014, St Paul&#x27;s commissioned Gerry Judah to create an artwork in the nave to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War. Two spectacular sculptures consisting of three-dimensional white cruciforms reflect the meticulously maintained war graves of northern France and further afield. Each sculpture is also embellished with miniaturised destroyed residential blocks depicting contemporary war zones in the Middle East—Syria, Baghdad, Afghanistan—thus connecting 100 years of warfare.

Bill Viola has created two altarpieces for permanent display in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The project commenced production in mid-2009. Following the extensive programme of cleaning and repair of the interior of St Paul&#x27;s, completed in 2005, Viola was commissioned to create two altarpieces on the themes of Mary and Martyrs. These two multi-screen video installations are permanently located at the end of the Quire aisles, flanking the High Altar of the cathedral and the American Memorial Chapel. Each work employs an arrangement of multiple plasma screen panels configured in a manner similar to historic altarpieces.

In summer 2010, St Paul&#x27;s chose two new works by the British artist Mark Alexander to be hung either side of the nave. Both entitled Red Mannheim, Alexander&#x27;s large red silkscreens are inspired by the Mannheim Cathedral altarpiece (1739–41), which was damaged by bombing in the Second World War. The original sculpture depicts Christ on the cross, surrounded by a familiar retinue of mourners. Rendered in splendid giltwood, with Christ&#x27;s wracked body sculpted in relief, and the flourishes of flora and incandescent rays from heaven, this masterpiece of the German Rococo is an object of ravishing beauty and intense piety.

In March 2010, Flare II, a sculpture by Antony Gormley, was installed in the Geometric Staircase.

In 2007, the Dean and Chapter commissioned Martin Firrell to create a major public artwork to mark the 300th anniversary of the topping-out of Wren&#x27;s building. The Question Mark Inside consisted of digital text projections to the cathedral dome, West Front and inside onto the Whispering Gallery. The text was based on blog contributions by the general public as well as interviews conducted by the artist and on the artist&#x27;s own views. The project presented a stream of possible answers to the question: &quot;What makes life meaningful and purposeful, and what does St Paul&#x27;s mean in that contemporary context?&quot; The Question Mark Inside opened on 8 November 2008 and ran for eight nights.

=== Depictions of St Paul&#x27;s ===
St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral has been depicted many times in paintings, prints and drawings. Among the well-known artists to have painted it are Canaletto, Turner, Daubigny, Pissarro, Signac, Derain, and Lloyd Rees.

==== Photography and portrayal in fiction ====
St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral has been the subject of many photographs, most notably the iconic image of the dome surrounded by smoke during the Blitz. It has also been used in games, films and TV programmes (including Thames Television&#x27;s most recognised ident), either as the focus of the film, as in the episode of &quot;Climbing Great Buildings&quot;; as a feature of the film, as in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;; as an incidental location such as Wren&#x27;s Geometric Staircase in the south-west tower which has appeared in several films including &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, or as a playable location in the 1998 video game &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot;.

Films in which St Paul&#x27;s has been depicted include:

* &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral&quot; (1942), a wartime documentary film for the British Council, the final part of which shows bomb damage in and around St Paul&#x27;s.
* &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) shows the exterior of the building and the bust of T. E. Lawrence.
* &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) shows the steps and west front of the cathedral, the main setting for the song &#x27;&quot;Feed the Birds&#x27;&quot;.
* St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral has appeared as a filming location twice in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in the 1968 serial &quot;The Invasion&quot;, and in the 2014 two-part story &quot;Dark Water&quot;/&quot;Death in Heaven&quot;. In both, the Cybermen are shown descending steps outside the cathedral.
* St Paul&#x27;s is seen briefly in the &quot;Goodies&quot; episode &quot;Kitten Kong&quot; (1971). During his rampage through London, Twinkle damages London landmarks, including St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the dome of which is knocked off.
* In the BBC educational programme &quot;A Guide to Armageddon&quot; (1982), a one-megaton nuclear weapon is detonated over London, with St Paul&#x27;s used as ground zero.
* &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (1985): The cathedral&#x27;s interior is the setting for the climax of the film.
* &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994) shows the Geometric Staircase in the South West Bell Tower.
* &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; (1998) features St Paul&#x27;s as the centerpiece of the playable London chapter, which Lara Croft explores on the hunt for the Eye of Isis. Notably, this version of St Paul&#x27;s is missing the iconic dome, which appears to be destroyed. However, the &quot;Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Collection&quot; (2024) fixed this and depicts St Paul&#x27;s complete with its iconic dome. In addition to this, St Paul&#x27;s dome is prominently displayed on the cover of the 1998 game.
* &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004) shows the Geometric Staircase in the south west bell tower, representing the staircase towards the Divination classroom.
* &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013) depicts St Paul&#x27;s in 23rd century London along with other notable modern-day London buildings.
* St Paul&#x27;s is the only building of ancient London that survived the &quot;Sixty Minute War&quot; in the movie &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; (2018) and the books it is based on.

<text>Arthur is an animated television series for children ages 4 to 8, developed by Kathy Waugh for PBS and produced by WGBH Boston. The show is set in the fictional U.S. city of Elwood City and revolves around the lives of Arthur Read, an anthropomorphic aardvark, his friends and family, and their daily interactions with each other. The television series is based on the &quot;Arthur&quot; book series written and illustrated by Marc Brown. Production on the series was first announced in 1995 by WGBH and Montreal-based animation studio CINAR, and aired its first episode on October 7, 1996. During its 25-season run, the show broadcast 253 half-hour episodes.

In June 2018, &quot;Arthur&quot; was renewed for four additional seasons, through its 25th season. It was subsequently announced on July 27, 2021, that the 25th season would be the final season. &quot;Arthur&quot; concluded its original run on PBS Kids on February 21, 2022.

&quot;Arthur&quot; has received praise for dealing with important issues that families face, such as asthma, dyslexia, cancer, diabetes, and autism. It also encourages reading and relationships with family and friends by explaining that people have different personalities, beliefs and interests. It was the longest-running children&#x27;s animated series in the U.S. until it was surpassed by &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; in 2025. and is the fourth longest-running animated series in the U.S., behind &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

==Setting==
Arthur Read, the series&#x27; titular character, is an anthropomorphic brown aardvark who lives in the fictional town of Elwood City. He is a third-grade student at Lakewood Elementary School. Arthur&#x27;s family includes two home-working parents, his father David (a chef) and his mother Jane (an accountant), his two younger sisters, Dora Winifred (D.W.), who is in preschool, and Kate, who is still an infant, and his dog, Pal. Arthur also has several friends who come from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and he also occasionally meets with members of his extended family.

Elwood City is portrayed as a largely suburban area which bears a strong resemblance to the Boston area; the TV series is partially produced by WGBH. There are also firm references to Brown&#x27;s hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. Most notably, the local shopping mall in the TV show is called &quot;Mill Creek Mall&quot;, a reference to Millcreek Mall. Brown himself stated that the series is influenced by his upbringing as a child in Erie, and specifically noted that Mr. Ratburn is based on a middle-school algebra teacher he had at Westlake Middle School.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1994, Marc Brown was approached by WGBH (a PBS affiliate) about the possibility of adapting his &quot;Arthur&quot; books into a television series. Brown was reluctant at first for he didn&#x27;t want to give up creative control of his characters. However, future executive producer of &quot;Arthur,&quot; Carol Greenwald from WGBH, assured Brown that their agenda was to encourage children to read and visit the library. Brown agreed, he himself signed on as an executive producer and was involved creatively. Initially, screenplays were based on Brown&#x27;s &quot;Arthur&quot; book catalog of around 20 stories. Following going through those, they branched off to write episodes they felt children would find interesting and relate to.

WGBH and CINAR officially announced the series on March 13, 1995, and that both companies would share production on the series; which was aimed for a 1996 release. Random House, the publisher of the &quot;Arthur&quot; book series; was announced as the home video distributor for the series in North America while CINAR would distribute the series on both television and home video internationally.

A majority of the show&#x27;s production is produced in Canada, mainly in regards to animation production and voice acting which were done within Montreal where CINAR&#x27;s studios were located. Production and voice acting would relocate to Toronto in 2004 after CINAR went under new management and rebranded as Cookie Jar Entertainment. Animation outsourcing was done within South Korea and Hong Kong, with AKOM Production Company handling the first eleven seasons and Animation Services (HK) Ltd for seasons 12 to 15. The series upgraded to 16:9 1080i HD for its fourteenth season, although the series remained in a 4:3 SD ratio on PBS until October 2012. On September 20, 2011, WGBH announced that 9 Story Entertainment would take over the co-producing role for the series beginning with Season 16 in Fall 2012 and distribute the newer seasons internationally. The major change to the series saw the animation production being moved in-house using Adobe Flash. On September 29, 2015, WGBH announced that animation production would move to the Montreal-based Oasis Animation for Season 20 in 2016.

The only segments of the show that were filmed outside Canada were the &quot;A Word from Us Kids&quot; interstitials, filmed at elementary schools or other educational sites in the Boston area. Beginning in season 11, the &quot;A Word From Us Kids&quot; segment was replaced by a segment called &quot;Postcards from You&quot;, where live-action videos sent in by young viewers were spotlighted per episode, and then replaced with &quot;A Word from Us Kids&quot; in season 12. The segments are omitted from all airings outside the US.

Marc Brown&#x27;s children, Tolon, Eliza, and Tucker, are referenced in the show several times, just as they are in the &quot;Arthur&quot; book series. For example, the town&#x27;s moving company is called &quot;Tolon Moving&quot;, and everyday items such as cups or pencil sharpeners have the word &quot;Eliza&quot; printed on them. References to Cookie Jar Entertainment and WGBH also appear often on the show. In one episode, Francine and Buster are shown playing a table hockey game in which one team&#x27;s players wear shirts in the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; signature colors with Montreal-based CINAR&#x27;s logo on them (CINAR was the predecessor to Cookie Jar Entertainment) and the other team&#x27;s players wear shirts in the Boston Bruins&#x27; colors with Boston-based WGBH&#x27;s sting logo on them. Subsequent episodes that involve hockey also depict players wearing these sweater designs. Also, in the episode &quot;The Big Blow-Up&quot; in season 2, a racecar driver wears a jersey with &quot;CINAR&quot; written on it and a car with &quot;WGBH&quot; written on it. In the episode &quot;Prove It&quot; in season 4, Brain introduces D.W. to science while watching a live-action episode of &quot;Nova&quot;, a science series also produced by WGBH. Brown&#x27;s son Tolon, for whom Brown first invented the character of Arthur the Aardvark in a bedtime story, was the executive director of the show.

In October 1999, CINAR was investigated for tax fraud. It was revealed that both the chairman Micheline Charest and president Ronald Weinberg invested $122 million (US) into Bahamian bank accounts without the board members&#x27; approval. CINAR had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept Canadian federal grants for content. However, &quot;Arthur&quot; itself was not involved in the scandal as it was publicly known to be co-produced with an American company. Head writers Joe Fallon and Ken Scarborough left around that time, but not because of the scandal; Fallon left about a year before the investigation began. Following the departures of Charest and Weinberg, former CBC and YTV executive Peter Moss took over CINAR, assuming Charest&#x27;s former position on the show as an executive producer alongside WGBH&#x27;s Carol Greenwald. By season 7, Moss had left CINAR to join Nelvana as a development executive, and financial director Andrew Porporino took his place as executive producer. He was replaced by longtime producer Lesley Taylor in season 8.

Production of the final season was completed by the end of 2019. The series finale, &quot;All Grown Up&quot; featured Arthur&#x27;s original voice actor, Michael Yarmush, voicing his adult self.

===Music===
The TV show&#x27;s reggae-style theme song, &quot;Believe in Yourself&quot;, was written by Judy Henderson and Jerry de Villiers Jr. and was performed by Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. A remixed techno version of the song has been officially released on the third album and a shortened version has been played during the closing credits for the sixth season. The Backstreet Boys covered the song with the original instrumentals for the ending credits of television special &quot;Arthur: It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

The original music score was produced by Ray Fabi.

In season 2, the song &quot;Crazy Bus&quot;, written and performed by then-head writer Joe Fallon, was introduced. It served as the alternate anthem of the television series. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and jazz composer Joshua Redman covered the song on the ending credits of the season 4 finale episode, &quot;My Music Rules&quot;. When Joe Fallon left Arthur after season 4, the song was officially retired from the show. The show mentions to this on the TV special &quot;Arthur: It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; when D.W. says, &quot;Crazy Bus is for babies; I know a million better songs.&quot;

===Guest stars===
Many celebrity guest stars have appeared on the show, each providing the voice for their anthropomorphic animal counterpart. Lance Armstrong and Joan Rivers are the only guest stars to make more than one appearance on the series.

==Cast and characters==

===Characters===
Arthur&#x27;s immediate family is the focus of the series, with most episodes involving Arthur, his younger sister D.W., their parents David and Jane, Baby Kate, and their dog, Pal. Arthur&#x27;s closest friends include Buster, Francine, Muffy, Binky, Brain, and Sue Ellen, along with others such as Fern, Prunella, Jenna, and George as frequent supporting characters.

The adults in &quot;Arthur&quot; play important roles: Mr. and Mrs. Read display a significant amount of stress from parenting, Arthur&#x27;s friends&#x27; parents are shown struggling in middle-class jobs, and Mr. Ratburn endures the demands and expectations of teaching elementary school. Even in difficult, adult situations, these grown ups maintain a cheerful attitude. Arthur, D.W., and Kate also visit their paternal grandmother, Thora Read, and maternal grandfather, Grandpa Dave.

===Voice cast===
Unlike most animated television series, &quot;Arthur&quot; showcases a wide range of voice actors. While the majority of the main supporting characters such as Jane, David, Buster, Francine and Binky have been voiced by the same set of actors since the beginning of the series, many of the young characters including Arthur, D.W., Brain, the Tibble Twins, and James have each been voiced by several actors throughout the seasons to avoid noticeable voice changes caused by male puberty.

==Episodes==
Each episode of &quot;Arthur&quot; ran for half an hour. Episodes consisted of two completely self-contained 11-minute stories. The episodes usually start off with one of the characters (usually Arthur) speaking towards the audience about a situation within the story followed by the title card. The episodes were separated by a one-to-two-minute live-action interstitial called &quot;And Now a Word from Us Kids&quot; (or, in some cases, a variation of that title more specific to its contents). The live action segments almost always featured children from elementary schools (generally in the Boston area) presenting subjects they are currently learning about or projects they have been working on in their classes (the subjects covered here relate to the first cartoon segment in the half-hour). This segment was seen exclusively on PBS telecasts of the show, filling space otherwise used for commercials, which are generally forbidden on PBS. There was also a segment that sometimes appears at the end of the second 11-minute episode called &quot;And Now a Word from Marc Brown&quot; where he shows the viewers how to draw various main characters from the show. In 2007, the show began encouraging viewers to send in &quot;video postcards&quot; (similar to those used in the spin-off show &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot;), which were shown in the interstitials of episodes until the middle of Season 12. Beginning with episode 151, the show reverted to &quot;And Now a Word from Us Kids&quot;.

Set in a realistic environment (as opposed to the more fantastical settings prominently featured in children&#x27;s programming), certain stories (often in the second half of the episode) may not necessarily focus on the titular protagonist&#x27;s point of view and may instead detail the experiences and viewpoints of surrounding characters, usually Arthur&#x27;s classmates. Often such episodes covered those characters handling situations often faced by children in actuality as a means of guiding audiences through those situations, including bed-wetting, asthma, or dyslexia, and Arthur&#x27;s character sometimes may see a reduced role (in some episodes, Arthur himself does not appear in the story at all). Stories in later seasons dealt with more serious issues or subjects, such as cancer, autism spectrum disorder, or even same-sex marriage, although numerous episodes simply addressed topics including childhood fears, trends, or fantasies. Occasionally, some episodes may not offer educational value. In spite of the realistically designed environment, the series showcased the fantasies or daydreams of a few characters on a number of occasions, and a few episodes feature supernatural elements such as ghosts or secret situations unknown to other characters such as Kate and Pal&#x27;s friendship.

In May 2019, Alabama Public Television withheld the airing of &quot;Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone&quot;, where Arthur&#x27;s teacher, Mr. Ratburn, married another man named Patrick. The station had also declined to broadcast a 2005 episode of the spin-off show, &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot;, where a friend had two mothers.

==Franchise==

===Television===
In addition to the television series, the &quot;Arthur&quot; franchise has spawned seven hour-long films, some of which used to be often run on PBS during pledge drives. An additional movie, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Missing Pal&quot;, was produced by Mainframe Entertainment and was the first animated &quot;Arthur&quot; project to make use of 3-D computer-generated imagery. &quot;Arthur&quot;″s success has also led to the spin-off series &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot;. A pilot for &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot; aired in December 2003 as a season 8 episode of &quot;Arthur&quot;. &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot; premiered on October 11, 2004, and continued until November 21, 2008; the series faced several years of hiatus, until a brief revival in February 2012 with two previously unaired episodes that had been held over from the show&#x27;s third season. 

===Website===
The program&#x27;s official website has been given a rating of 5/5 stars at website &quot;Common Sense Media&quot;, and has been advised for viewers 5 and up. The site described the show as being &quot;one of the Internet&#x27;s best offerings for kids&quot;. It also advised that &quot;there are links to PBS sponsors but other than that, there is no commercial marketing to kids.&quot; The review added, &quot;The games are actually teaching your kids something for example &quot;The Music Box&quot; combines music and learning, so much so that kids won&#x27;t even realize that they&#x27;re figuring out space relations, hand–eye coordination, and mousing skills as they jam along to upbeat tunes.&quot;

===Music albums===

&quot;Arthur&quot; has released three music albums. The first album, &quot;Arthur and Friends: The First Almost Real Not Live CD&quot;, contained songs that were played throughout the TV show and original songs for the album. The second album, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Perfect Christmas&quot;, contained songs that were played during the television film of the same title. The third album, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Really Rockin&#x27; Music Mix&quot;, contained only original songs, including a remix of the theme song which was played on the credits of season 6 as a promotion for the album.

===ActiMates===
In 1998, both Arthur and D.W. were made into Microsoft ActiMates, refined toy dolls who could interact with children, with each other, with certain computer software and the &quot;Arthur&quot; website, and also with the &quot;Arthur&quot; television show and videos.

Microsoft discontinued the ActiMates line shortly before season 5 aired, most possibly due to a lawsuit pertaining to patent infringement and the fact that sales were dropping. It has been noted that post-season 4 episodes of &quot;Arthur&quot; have not included any ActiMates code. Newer videos and DVD releases of the show does not carry ActiMates code either. The enhancements on the website were removed when the site was redesigned in 2002 and thus the ActiMates would not interact with the website. Likewise, re-releases of the ActiMates software by Creative Wonders do not interact with the ActiMates because the library that controls the PC Pack has been replaced with a dummy library file.

===Video games===
===Home media releases===
Selected episodes were distributed on VHS and DVD by Random House. Each tape had two or three episodes dealing with similar subjects. WGBH Home Video also released two Region 1 &quot;Arthur&quot; season sets; they released season 10 on March 25, 2008, and season 11 was released on September 2, 2008. Seasons 10–19 are available to download on the iTunes Store and Amazon.com. The first three seasons were released over four collections (the second season was split into two volumes) on DVD in Europe only.

==Broadcast==
&quot;Arthur&quot; became one of the highest-rated shows on PBS Kids for several years since its debut, averaging almost 10 million viewers weekly in the U.S. It is aired in a total of 83 countries, including on: PBS in the United States; Radio-Canada, Knowledge Network, TVOntario, TFO, and CBC in Canada; several ABC channels in Australia; and BBC One/CBBC/CBeebies in the UK and PBS Kids in South Africa. It also aired in Ireland on TnaG (now TG4) in an Irish dubbed version.

==Reception==

===Awards===
The series has been acknowledged with the George Foster Peabody Award and four Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Animated Program. The television writers of The Associated Press voted &quot;Arthur&quot; as one of the top 10 television shows of the 1990s. In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Arthur Read No. 26 on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot;. The show has also won a BAFTA and was nominated for 17 Daytime Emmys.

===Critical response===
Ostrov, Gentile, and Crick (2006) write that &quot;our viewing of many educational programs such as &quot;Arthur&quot; suggests that relational aggression is modeled at a fairly high rate. For example, children may be shown excluding and ostracizing friends or peers on the playground as part of the TV show.&quot; (p. 622). They go on to theorize that preschoolers, due to their developmental stage, may have a hard time fully understanding conflict resolution, which typically occurs at the very end of a show. Shows like &quot;Arthur&quot; typically spend most of their time building up conflicts and this may impact the type of learning that is occurring while watching shows. Moreover, they cite research suggesting that the impacts of modeling relational aggression may be especially strong for girls. This research was elaborated on in the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling book on parenting &quot;NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children&quot; by Bronson and Merryman (2009). Their punch line is: &quot;Essentially, Ostrov had just found that &quot;Arthur&quot; is more dangerous for children than &quot;Power Rangers&quot;&quot; (p. 181).

About.com gave the show a rating of 4.5 stars. The series described &quot;Arthur&quot; assets: The &quot;Arthur&quot; series has won several awards including the George Foster Peabody, and for good reason. &quot;Arthur&quot; presents issues and situations kids can relate to, and teaches positive behaviors and responses to these issues in a genuine and comical way. The series is fun and engaging to the target age group. Kids will relate to the storylines and characters, and will therefore give thought to the responses the characters demonstrate and outcome of those responses. Because &quot;Arthur&quot; presents real childhood issues, the show contains some imitative behavior such as name calling or bickering, much like children experience in their own lives. Kids might hear words like &quot;sissy&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; and see Arthur and D.W. argue. Should children mimic some of these phrases or tactics, the show provides a good springboard for parents to talk about the issues with their children and point out the importance of considering others&#x27; feelings. The review continued by citing many ways in which children could extract more from the series, for example by encouraging kids to write stories based on their own families (in much the same way &quot;Arthur&quot; was first realised) or by Kim Brown, Marc Brown&#x27;s sister, teaching kids to draw Arthur while on tour.

Jillian Fabiano of &quot;E! News&quot; wrote that the show&#x27;s ending &quot;has taught kindness, empathy and inclusion for 25 years.&quot;

In July 2014, Chance the Rapper released his interpretation of the theme song of the series called &quot;Wonderful Everyday: Arthur&quot; with Wyclef Jean and Jessie Ware.

In and leading up to July 2016, &quot;Arthur&quot; regained attention from users of Black Twitter, where stills from the series have become explicit and comedic internet memes, often using an image of Arthur&#x27;s clenched fist from the episode &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Big Hit&quot;. WGBH said, &quot;We appreciate the memes that have been created and shared in good fun, we are, however, disappointed by the few that are outside of good taste.&quot; In a February 2022 interview with &quot;Yahoo! Entertainment&quot;, Marc Brown expressed his appreciation that the show has become a pop culture meme mainstay, and found it funny when celebrities like LeBron James and John Legend used memes from the show.

<text>An essential amino acid, or indispensable amino acid, is an amino acid that cannot be synthesized from scratch by the organism fast enough to supply its demand, and must therefore come from the diet. Of the 21 amino acids common to all life forms, the nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, histidine, and lysine.

Six other amino acids are considered conditionally essential in the human diet, meaning their synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress. These six are arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline, and tyrosine. Six amino acids are non-essential (dispensable) in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These six are alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, serine, and selenocysteine (considered the 21st amino acid). Pyrrolysine (considered the 22nd amino acid), which is proteinogenic only in certain microorganisms, is not used by and therefore non-essential for most organisms, including humans.

The limiting amino acid is the essential amino acid which is furthest from meeting nutritional requirements. This concept is important when determining the selection, number, and amount of foods to consume because even when total protein and all other essential amino acids are satisfied if the limiting amino acid is not satisfied then the meal is considered to be nutritionally limited by that amino acid.

==Overview==

(*) Pyrrolysine, sometimes considered the &quot;22nd amino acid&quot;, is not used by the human body.

==Essentiality in humans==
Of the twenty amino acids common to all life forms (not counting selenocysteine), humans cannot synthesize nine: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. Additionally, the amino acids arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline and tyrosine are considered conditionally essential, which means that specific populations who do not synthesize it in adequate amounts, such as newborn infants and people with diseased livers who are unable to synthesize cysteine, must obtain one or more of these conditionally essential amino acids from their diet. For example, enough arginine is synthesized by the urea cycle to meet the needs of an adult but perhaps not those of a growing child. Amino acids that must be obtained from the diet are called essential amino acids. 

Eukaryotes can synthesize some of the amino acids from other substrates. Consequently, only a subset of the amino acids used in protein synthesis are essential nutrients.

== From intermediates of the citric acid cycle and other pathways ==

Nonessential amino acids are produced in the body. The pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids come from basic metabolic pathways. Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids. At this step, the chirality of the amino acid is established. Alanine and aspartate are synthesized by the transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Glutamine is synthesized from NH4+ and glutamate, and asparagine is synthesized similarly. Proline and arginine are both derived from glutamate. Serine, formed from 3-phosphoglycerate, which comes from glycolysis, is the precursor of glycine and cysteine. Tyrosine is synthesized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, which is an essential amino acid.

==Recommended daily intake==

Estimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven to be difficult; these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the last 20 years. The following table lists the recommended daily amounts currently in use for essential amino acids in adult humans (unless specified otherwise), together with their standard one-letter abbreviations.
The recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10% to 20% higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150% higher in the first year of life. Cysteine (or sulfur-containing amino acids), tyrosine (or aromatic amino acids), and arginine are always required by infants and growing children. Methionine and cysteine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme methionine &quot;S&quot;-methyltransferase and the catalyst methionine synthase. Phenylalanine and tyrosine are grouped together because tyrosine can be synthesized from phenylalanine using the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.

==Amino acid requirements and the amino acid content of food==
Historically, amino acid requirements were determined by calculating the balance between dietary nitrogen intake and nitrogen excreted in the liquid and solid wastes, because proteins represent the largest nitrogen content in a body. A positive balance occurs when more nitrogen is consumed than is excreted, which indicates that some of the nitrogen is being used by the body to build proteins. A negative nitrogen balance occurs when more nitrogen is excreted than is consumed, which indicates that there is insufficient intake for the body to maintain its health. Graduate students at the University of Illinois were fed an artificial diet so that there was a slightly positive nitrogen balance. Then one amino acid was omitted and the nitrogen balance recorded. If a positive balance continued, then that amino acid was deemed not essential. If a negative balance occurred, then that amino acid was slowly restored until a slightly positive nitrogen balance stabilized and the minimum amount recorded.

A similar method was used to determine the protein content of foods. Test subjects were fed a diet containing no protein and the nitrogen losses recorded. During the first week or more there is a rapid loss of labile proteins. Once the nitrogen losses stabilize, this baseline is determined to be the minimum required for maintenance. Then the test subjects were fed a measured amount of the food being tested. The difference between the nitrogen in that food and the nitrogen losses above baseline was the amount the body retained to rebuild proteins. The amount of nitrogen retained divided by the total nitrogen intake is called net protein utilization. The amount of nitrogen retained divided by the (nitrogen intake minus nitrogen loss above baseline) is called biological value and is usually given as a percentage.

Modern techniques make use of ion exchange chromatography to determine the actual amino acid content of foods. The USDA used this technique in their own labs to determine the content of 7793 foods across 28 categories. The USDA published the final database in 2018 to the public.

The limiting amino acid depends on the human requirements and there are currently two sets of human requirements from authoritative sources: one published by WHO and the other published by USDA.

===Protein quality===
Various attempts have been made to express the &quot;quality&quot; or &quot;value&quot; of various kinds of protein. Measures include the biological value, net protein utilization, protein efficiency ratio, protein digestibility corrected amino acid score and the complete proteins concept. These concepts are important in the livestock industry, because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in animal feeds would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on feed conversion ratio. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a supplement of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.

===Protein per calorie===
Protein content in foods is often measured in protein per serving rather than protein per calorie. For instance, the USDA lists 6 grams of protein per large whole egg (a 50-gram serving) rather than 84 mg of protein per calorie (71 calories total). For comparison, there are 2.8 grams of protein in a serving of raw broccoli (100 grams) or 82 mg of protein per calorie (34 calories total), or the Daily Value of 47.67g of protein after eating 1,690g of raw broccoli a day at 574 cal. An egg contains 12.5g of protein per 100g, but 4 mg more protein per calorie, or the protein DV after 381g of egg, which is 545 cal. The ratio of essential amino acids (the quality of protein) is not taken into account, one would actually need to eat more than 3 kg of broccoli a day to have a healthy protein profile, and almost 6 kg to get enough calories. It is recommended that adult humans obtain between 10–35% of their 2000 calories a day as protein.

==Complete proteins in non-human animals==
Scientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was zein, which comes from maize (corn), but recovered if they were fed casein from cow&#x27;s milk. This led William Cumming Rose to the discovery of the essential amino acid threonine. Through manipulation of rodent diets, Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats: lysine, tryptophan, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, and arginine, in addition to threonine. Rose&#x27;s later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer-term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.

==Interchangeability==
The distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and homocysteine, can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Likewise arginine, ornithine, and citrulline, which are interconvertible by the urea cycle, are considered a single group.

==Effects of deficiency==

If one of the essential amino acids is not available in the required quantities, protein synthesis will be inhibited, irrespective of the availability of the other amino acids. Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body&#x27;s organs and many of its systems, for example affecting brain development in infants and young children; inhibiting upkeep of the immune system, increasing risk of infection; affecting gut mucosal function and permeability, thereby reducing absorption and increasing vulnerability to systemic disease; and impacting kidney function. The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair. Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low serum albumin and low serum transferrin.

The amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by William Cumming Rose. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of corn starch, sucrose, butterfat without protein, corn oil, inorganic salts, the known vitamins, a large brown &quot;candy&quot; made of liver extract flavored with peppermint oil (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was nitrogen balance. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.

Essential amino acid deficiency should be distinguished from protein-energy malnutrition, which can manifest as marasmus or kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories (&quot;sugar baby syndrome&quot;). However, this theory has been challenged by the finding that there is no difference in the diets of children developing marasmus as opposed to kwashiorkor. Still, for instance in Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) maintained by the USDA, lack of one or more of the essential amino acids is described as protein-energy malnutrition.

<text>The three districts of Luxembourg ( ; ; ) were the top-level administrative divisions of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The districts were further subdivided into cantons, which still exist:
#Diekirch District
#*Diekirch
#*Clervaux
#*Redange
#*Vianden
#*Wiltz
#Grevenmacher District
#*Grevenmacher
#*Echternach
#*Remich
#Luxembourg District
#*Luxembourg
#*Capellen
#*Esch-sur-Alzette
#*Mersch

The cantons were created on 24 February 1843. In 1857, Mersch District was created from the cantons of Mersch and Redange. However, this fourth district was abolished in 1867, when the re-arrangements of 1857 were undone.

The districts were abolished on 3 October 2015 leaving the cantons, of which there are 12, as the most senior local authorities of Luxembourg.

<text>The net protein utilization (NPU) is the percentage of ingested nitrogen that is retained in the body.

==Rating==
It is used to determine the nutritional efficiency of protein in the diet, that is, it is used as a measure of &quot;protein quality&quot; for human nutritional purposes.

As a value, NPU can range from 0 to 1 (or 100), with a value of 1 (or 100) indicating 100% utilization of dietary nitrogen as protein and a value of 0 an indication that none of the nitrogen supplied was converted to protein.

Certain foodstuffs, such as eggs or milk, rate as 1 on an NPU chart.

Experimentally, this value can be determined by determining dietary protein intake and then measuring nitrogen excretion. One formula for apparent NPU is:

:NPU = {0.16 × (24 hour protein intake in grams)} - {(24 hour urinary urea nitrogen) + 2} - {0.1 × (ideal body weight in kilograms)} / {0.16 × (24 hour protein intake in grams)}

NPU and biological value (BV) both measure nitrogen retention; the difference is that biological value is calculated from nitrogen absorbed, whereas net protein utilization is from nitrogen ingested. Another closely related quantity is the net postprandial protein utilization (NPPU), which is the maximum potential NPU of a dietary protein source under ideal conditions.

The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) is a more modern rating for determining protein quality, and the current ranking standard used by the FDA.

The Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) is a protein quality method, proposed in March 2013 by the Food and Agriculture Organization to replace the current protein ranking standard, the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS). The proposition is contested, however, due to lack of data.

<text>In mathematics, [[orthogonality (mathematics)|orthogonality]] is the generalization of the geometric notion of &quot;perpendicularity&quot;. Although many authors use the two terms &quot;perpendicular&quot; and &quot;orthogonal&quot; interchangeably, the term &quot;perpendicular&quot; is more specifically used for lines and planes that intersect to form a right angle, whereas &quot;orthogonal&quot; is used in generalizations, such as &quot;orthogonal vectors&quot; or &quot;orthogonal curves&quot;. 

&quot;Orthogonality&quot; is also used with various meanings that are often weakly related or not related at all with the mathematical meanings.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Ancient Greek (&#x27;), meaning &quot;upright&quot;, and (&#x27;), meaning &quot;angle&quot;.

The Ancient Greek (&#x27;) and Classical Latin &#x27; originally denoted a rectangle. Later, they came to mean a right triangle. In the 12th century, the post-classical Latin word &quot;orthogonalis&quot; came to mean a right angle or something related to a right angle.

==Mathematics==
==Physics==

===Optics===
In optics, polarization states are said to be orthogonal when they propagate independently of each other, as in vertical and horizontal linear polarization or right-handed and left-handed circular polarization.

===Special relativity===
In special relativity, a time axis determined by a rapidity of motion is hyperbolic-orthogonal to a space axis of simultaneous events, also determined by the rapidity. The theory features relativity of simultaneity.

====Hyperbolic orthogonality====
===Quantum mechanics===

In quantum mechanics, a sufficient (but not necessary) condition that two eigenstates of a Hermitian operator, formula_1 and formula_2, are orthogonal is that they correspond to different eigenvalues. This means, in Dirac notation, that formula_3 if formula_1 and formula_2 correspond to different eigenvalues. This follows from the fact that Schrödinger&#x27;s equation is a Sturm–Liouville equation (in Schrödinger&#x27;s formulation) or that observables are given by Hermitian operators (in Heisenberg&#x27;s formulation).

==Art==
In art, the perspective (imaginary) lines pointing to the vanishing point are referred to as &quot;orthogonal lines&quot;. The term &quot;orthogonal line&quot; often has a quite different meaning in the literature of modern art criticism. Many works by painters such as Piet Mondrian and Burgoyne Diller are noted for their exclusive use of &quot;orthogonal lines&quot; — not, however, with reference to perspective, but rather referring to lines that are straight and exclusively horizontal or vertical, forming right angles where they intersect. For example, an essay of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum states that &quot;Mondrian [...] dedicated his entire oeuvre to the investigation of the balance between orthogonal lines and primary colours.&quot;

==Computer science==

Orthogonality in programming language design is the ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results. This usage was introduced by Van Wijngaarden in the design of Algol 68:
The number of independent primitive concepts has been minimized in order that the language be easy to describe, to learn, and to implement. On the other hand, these concepts have been applied “orthogonally” in order to maximize the expressive power of the language while trying to avoid deleterious superfluities.
Orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and it is essential for feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.

===Orthogonal instruction set===
An instruction set is said to be orthogonal if it lacks redundancy (i.e., there is only a single instruction that can be used to accomplish a given task) and is designed such that instructions can use any register in any addressing mode. This terminology results from considering an instruction as a vector whose components are the instruction fields. One field identifies the registers to be operated upon and another specifies the addressing mode. An orthogonal instruction set uniquely encodes all combinations of registers and addressing modes.

==Telecommunications==

In telecommunications, multiple access schemes are orthogonal when an ideal receiver can completely reject arbitrarily strong unwanted signals from the desired signal using different basis functions. One such scheme is time-division multiple access (TDMA), where the orthogonal basis functions are nonoverlapping rectangular pulses (&quot;time slots&quot;).

===Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing===

Another scheme is orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which refers to the use, by a single transmitter, of a set of frequency multiplexed signals with the exact minimum frequency spacing needed to make them orthogonal so that they do not interfere with each other. Well known examples include (a, g, and n) versions of 802.11 Wi-Fi; WiMAX; ITU-T G.hn, DVB-T, the terrestrial digital TV broadcast system used in most of the world outside North America; and DMT (Discrete Multi Tone), the standard form of ADSL.

In OFDM, the subcarrier frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that crosstalk between the subchannels is eliminated and intercarrier guard bands are not required. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver. In conventional FDM, a separate filter for each subchannel is required.

==Statistics, econometrics, and economics==
When performing statistical analysis, independent variables that affect a particular dependent variable are said to be orthogonal if they are uncorrelated, since the covariance forms an inner product. In this case the same results are obtained for the effect of any of the independent variables upon the dependent variable, regardless of whether one models the effects of the variables individually with simple regression or simultaneously with multiple regression. If correlation is present, the factors are not orthogonal and different results are obtained by the two methods. This usage arises from the fact that if centered by subtracting the expected value (the mean), uncorrelated variables are orthogonal in the geometric sense discussed above, both as observed data (i.e., vectors) and as random variables (i.e., density functions).
One econometric formalism that is alternative to the maximum likelihood framework, the Generalized Method of Moments, relies on orthogonality conditions. In particular, the Ordinary Least Squares estimator may be easily derived from an orthogonality condition between the explanatory variables and model residuals.

==Taxonomy==
In taxonomy, an orthogonal classification is one in which no item is a member of more than one group, that is, the classifications are mutually exclusive.

==Chemistry and biochemistry==

In chemistry and biochemistry, an orthogonal interaction occurs when there are two pairs of substances and each substance can interact with their respective partner, but does not interact with either substance of the other pair. For example, DNA has two orthogonal pairs: cytosine and guanine form a base-pair, and adenine and thymine form another base-pair, but other base-pair combinations are strongly disfavored. As a chemical example, tetrazine reacts with transcyclooctene and azide reacts with cyclooctyne without any cross-reaction, so these are mutually orthogonal reactions, and so, can be performed simultaneously and selectively. 

===Organic synthesis===

In organic synthesis, orthogonal protection is a strategy allowing the deprotection of functional groups independently of each other. 

===Bioorthogonal chemistry===
===Supramolecular chemistry===

In supramolecular chemistry the notion of orthogonality refers to the possibility of two or more supramolecular, often non-covalent, interactions being compatible; reversibly forming without interference from the other.

===Analytical chemistry===

In analytical chemistry, analyses are &quot;orthogonal&quot; if they make a measurement or identification in completely different ways, thus increasing the reliability of the measurement. Orthogonal testing thus can be viewed as &quot;cross-checking&quot; of results, and the &quot;cross&quot; notion corresponds to the etymologic origin of &quot;orthogonality&quot;. Orthogonal testing is often required as a part of a new drug application.

==System reliability==
In the field of system reliability orthogonal redundancy is that form of redundancy where the form of backup device or method is completely different from the prone to error device or method. The failure mode of an orthogonally redundant back-up device or method does not intersect with and is completely different from the failure mode of the device or method in need of redundancy to safeguard the total system against catastrophic failure.

==Neuroscience==
In neuroscience, a sensory map in the brain which has overlapping stimulus coding (e.g. location and quality) is called an orthogonal map.

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, two topics, authors, or pieces of writing are said to be &quot;orthogonal&quot; to each other when they do not substantively cover what could be considered potentially overlapping or competing claims. Thus, texts in philosophy can either support and complement one another, they can offer competing explanations or systems, or they can be orthogonal to each other in cases where the scope, content, and purpose of the pieces of writing are entirely unrelated.

==Gaming==

In board games such as chess which feature a grid of squares, &#x27;orthogonal&#x27; is used to mean &quot;in the same row/&#x27;rank&#x27; or column/&#x27;file&#x27;&quot;. This is the counterpart to squares which are &quot;diagonally adjacent&quot;. In the ancient Chinese board game Go a player can capture the stones of an opponent by occupying all orthogonally adjacent points.

==Law==
In law, orthogonality can refer to interests in a proceeding that are not aligned, but also bear no correlation or effect on each other, so as not to create a conflict of interest.

==Other examples==
Stereo vinyl records encode both the left and right stereo channels in a single groove. The V-shaped groove in the vinyl has walls that are 90 degrees to each other, with variations in each wall separately encoding one of the two analogue channels that make up the stereo signal. The cartridge senses the motion of the stylus following the groove in two orthogonal directions: 45 degrees from vertical to either side. A pure horizontal motion corresponds to a mono signal, equivalent to a stereo signal in which both channels carry identical (in-phase) signals.

<doc id="102225" wikidata="Q1205020" url="?curid=102225" title="SuperH">
<text>SuperH (or SH) is a 32-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Hitachi and currently produced by Renesas. It is implemented by microcontrollers and microprocessors for embedded systems.

At the time of introduction, SuperH was notable for having fixed-length 16-bit instructions in spite of its 32-bit architecture. Using smaller instructions had consequences: the register file was smaller and instructions were generally two-operand format. However for the market the SuperH was aimed at, this was a small price to pay for the improved memory and processor cache efficiency.

Later versions of the design, starting with SH-5, included both 16- and 32-bit instructions, with the 16-bit versions mapping onto the 32-bit version inside the CPU. This allowed the machine code to continue using the shorter instructions to save memory, while not demanding the amount of instruction decoding logic needed if they were completely separate instructions. This concept is now known as a compressed instruction set and is also used by other companies, the most notable example being ARM for its Thumb instruction set.

In 2015, many of the original patents for the SuperH architecture expired and the SH-2 CPU was reimplemented as open source hardware under the name J2.

==History==
===SH-1 and SH-2===

The SuperH processor core family was first developed by Hitachi in the early 1990s. The design concept was for a single instruction set (ISA) that would be upward compatible across a series of CPU cores.

In the past, this sort of design problem would have been solved using microcode, with the low-end models in the series performing non-implemented instructions as a series of more basic instructions. For instance, a &quot;long multiply&quot; (multiplying two 32-bit registers to produce a 64-bit product) might be implemented in hardware on high-end models but instead be performed as a series of additions on low-end models.

One of the key realizations during the development of the RISC concept was that the microcode had a finite decoding time, and as processors became faster, this represented an unacceptable performance overhead. To address this, Hitachi instead developed a single ISA for the entire line, with unsupported instructions causing traps on those implementations that didn&#x27;t include hardware support. For instance, the initial models in the line, the SH-1 and SH-2, differed only in their support for 64-bit multiplication; the SH-2 supported , and , whereas the SH-1 would cause a trap if these were encountered.

The SH-1 was the basic model, supporting a total of 56 instructions. The SH-2 added 64-bit multiplication and a few additional commands for branching and other duties, bringing the total to 62 supported instructions. The SH-1 and the SH-2 were used in the Sega Saturn, Sega 32X and Capcom CPS-3.

The ISA uses 16-bit instructions for better code density than 32-bit instructions, which was important at the time due to the high cost of main memory and the implementation cost of cache. As of 2023, code density is still important for small embedded systems and massively multicore processors. The downsides to this approach were that there were fewer bits available to encode a register number or a constant value. In the original SuperH ISA, there were only 16 general registers, requiring four bits for the source and another four for the destination; however some instructions have an implied R0, R15, or a system register as an extra operand. The instruction opcode is four, eight, twelve, or sixteen bits long, and the remaining four-bit fields are used for register or immediate operands in various ways: there are twelve classes of instructions, for a total of 142 instructions in SH-2.

Delayed branches are introduced for both SH-1 and SH-2. Unconditional branch instructions have one delay slot.

===SH-3===
A few years later, the SH-3 core was added to the family; new features included another interrupt concept, a memory management unit (MMU), and a modified cache concept. These features required an extended instruction set, adding six new instructions for a total of 68. The SH-3 was bi-endian, running in either big-endian or little-endian byte ordering.

The SH-3 core also added a DSP extension, then called SH-3-DSP. With extended data paths for efficient DSP processing, special accumulators and a dedicated MAC-type DSP engine, this core unified the DSP and the RISC processor world. A derivative of the DSP was also used with the original SH-2 core.

Between 1994 and 1996, 35.1 million SuperH devices were shipped worldwide.

===SH-4===
In 1997, Hitachi and STMicroelectronics (STM) started collaborating on the design of the SH-4 for the Dreamcast. SH-4 featured superscalar (2-way) instruction execution and a vector floating-point unit (particularly suited to 3D graphics). Standard chips based on the SH-4 were introduced around 1998.

===Licensing===
In early 2001, Hitachi and STM formed the IP company SuperH, Inc., which was going to license the SH-4 core to other companies and was developing the SH-5 architecture, the first move of SuperH into the 64-bit area. The earlier SH-1 through 3 remained the property of Hitachi.

In 2003, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric formed a joint-venture called Renesas Technology, with Hitachi controlling 55% of it. In 2004, Renesas Technology bought STMicroelectronics&#x27;s share of ownership in the SuperH Inc. and with it the licence to the SH cores. Renesas Technology later became Renesas Electronics, following their merger with NEC Electronics.

The SH-5 design supported two modes of operation: SHcompact mode, which is equivalent to the user-mode instructions of the SH-4 instruction set; and SHmedia mode, which is very different in that it uses 32-bit instructions with sixty-four 64-bit integer registers and SIMD instructions. In SHmedia mode the destination of a branch (jump) is loaded into a branch register separately from the actual branch instruction. This allows the processor to prefetch instructions for a branch without having to snoop the instruction stream. The combination of a compact 16-bit instruction encoding with a more powerful 32-bit instruction encoding is not unique to SH-5; ARM processors have a 16-bit Thumb mode (ARM licensed several patents from SuperH for Thumb) and MIPS processors have a MIPS-16 mode. However, SH-5 differs because its backward compatibility mode is the 16-bit encoding rather than the 32-bit encoding.

The last evolutionary step happened around 2003 where the cores from SH-2 up to SH-4 were getting unified into a superscalar SH-X core which formed a kind of instruction set superset of the previous architectures, and added support for symmetric multiprocessing.

===Continued availability===
Since 2010, the SuperH CPU cores, architecture and products are with Renesas Electronics and the architecture is consolidated around the SH-2, SH-2A, SH-3, SH-4 and SH-4A platforms. The system-on-chip products based on SH-3, SH-4 and SH-4A microprocessors were subsequently replaced by newer generations based on licensed CPU cores from Arm Ltd., with many of the existing models still marketed and sold until March 2025 through the Renesas Product Longevity Program.

As of 2021, the SH72xx microcontrollers based on the SH-2A continue to be marketed by Renesas with guaranteed availability until February 2029, along with newer products based on several other architectures including Arm, RX, and RH850.

===J Core===

The last of the SH-2 patents expired in 2014. At LinuxCon Japan 2015, j-core developers presented a cleanroom reimplemention of the SH-2 ISA with extensions (known as the &quot;J2 core&quot; due to the unexpired trademarks). Subsequently, a design walkthrough was presented at ELC 2016.

The open source BSD-licensed VHDL code for the J2 core has been proven on Xilinx FPGAs and on ASICs manufactured on TSMC&#x27;s 180 nm process, and is capable of booting μClinux. J2 is backwards ISA compatible with SH-2, implemented as a 5-stage pipeline with separate Instruction and Data memory interfaces, and a machine-generated Instruction Decoder supporting the densely packed and complex (relative to other RISC machines) ISA. Additional instructions are easy to add. J2 implements instructions for dynamic shift (using the SH-3 and later instruction patterns), extended atomic operations (used for threading primitives) and locking/interfaces for symmetric multiprocessor support. Plans to implement the SH-2A (as &quot;J2+&quot;) and SH-4 (as &quot;J4&quot;) instruction sets as the relevant patents expire in 2016–2017.

Several features of SuperH have been cited as motivations for designing new cores based on this architecture:

* High code density compared to other 32-bit RISC ISAs such as ARM or MIPS important for cache and memory bandwidth performance
* Existing compiler and operating system support (Linux, Windows Embedded, QNX)
* Extremely low ASIC fabrication costs now that the patents are expiring (around for a dual-core J2 core on TSMC&#x27;s 180 nm process).
* Patent- and royalty-free (BSD-licensed) implementation
* Full and vibrant community support
* Availability of low cost hardware development platform for zero cost FPGA tools
* CPU and SoC RTL generation and integration tools, producing FPGA and ASIC portable RTL and documentation
* Clean, modern design with open source design, generation, simulation and verification environment

==Models==
The family of SuperH CPU cores includes:
* SH-1 – used in microcontrollers for deeply embedded applications (CD-ROM drives, major appliances, etc.)
* SH-2 – used in microcontrollers with higher performance requirements, networking applications, and also in video game consoles, like the Sega Saturn and Sega 32X add-on. The SH-2 has also found home in many automotive engine control unit applications, including Subaru, Mitsubishi, and Mazda.
* SH-2A – The SH-2A core is an extension of the SH-2 core including a few extra instructions but most importantly moving to a superscalar architecture (it is capable of executing more than one instruction in a single cycle) and two five-stage pipelines. It also incorporates 15 register banks to facilitate an interrupt latency of 6 clock cycles. It is also strong in motor control application but also in multimedia, car audio, powertrain, automotive body control and office + building automation
* SH-DSP – initially developed for the mobile phone market, used later in many consumer applications requiring DSP performance for JPEG compression etc.
* SH-3 – used for mobile and handheld applications such as the Jornada, strong in Windows CE applications and market for many years in the car navigation market. The Cave CV1000, similar to the Sega NAOMI hardware&#x27;s CPU, also made use of this CPU. The Korg Electribe EMX and ESX music production units also use the SH-3.
* SH-3-DSP – used mainly in multimedia terminals and networking applications, also in printers and fax machines
* SH-4 – used whenever high performance is required such as car multimedia terminals, video game consoles, most notably the Dreamcast, or set-top boxes
* SH-5 – used in high-end 64-bit multimedia applications
* SH-X – mainstream core used in various flavours (with/without DSP or FPU unit) in engine control unit, car multimedia equipment, set-top boxes or mobile phones
* SH-Mobile – SuperH Mobile Application Processor; designed to offload application processing from the baseband LSI

===SH-2===
The SH-2 is a 32-bit RISC architecture with a 16-bit fixed instruction length for high code density and features a hardware multiply–accumulate (MAC) block for DSP algorithms and has a five-stage pipeline.

The SH-2 has a cache on all ROM-less devices.

It provides 16 general-purpose registers, a vector-base register, global-base register, and a procedure register.

Today the SH-2 family stretches from 32 KB of on-board flash up to ROM-less devices. It is used in a variety of different devices with differing peripherals such as CAN, Ethernet, motor-control timer unit, fast ADC and others.

===SH-2A===
The SH-2A is an upgrade to the SH-2 core that added some 32-bit instructions. It was announced in early 2006.

New features on the SH-2A core include:
* Superscalar architecture: execution of 2 instructions simultaneously
* Harvard architecture
* Two 5-stage pipelines
* Mixed 16-bit and 32-bit instructions
* 15 register banks for interrupt response in 6 cycles.
* Optional FPU

The SH-2A family today spans a wide memory field from 16 KB up to and includes many ROM-less variations. The devices feature standard peripherals such as CAN, Ethernet, USB and more as well as more application-specific peripherals such as motor control timers, TFT controllers and peripherals dedicated to automotive powertrain applications.
===SH-3===
===SH-4===
The SH-4 is a RISC CPU and was developed for primary use in multimedia applications, such as Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast and NAOMI game systems. It includes a much more powerful floating-point unit and additional built-in functions, along with the standard 32-bit integer processing and 16-bit instruction size.

SH-4 features include:
* FPU with four floating-point multipliers, supporting 32-bit single-precision and 64-bit double-precision floats

There is no FPU in the custom SH-4 made for Casio, the SH7305.

===SH-5===
The SH-5 is a 64-bit RISC CPU.

Almost no non-simulated SH-5 hardware was ever released, and, unlike the still-live SH-4, support for SH-5 was dropped from GCC and Linux.

===SH-6===
SH-6 was an announced but never implemented further development. It was supposed to achieve over 2 GIPS, over 7 GFLOPS and over 24 GOPS.

<text>The Washington Post, locally known as The&quot; &quot;Post and, informally, WaPo or WP, is an American daily newspaper published in Washington, D.C., the national capital. It is the most widely circulated newspaper in the Washington metropolitan area and has a national audience. As of 2023, the &quot;Post&quot; had 130,000 print subscribers and 2.5 million digital subscribers, both of which were the third-largest among U.S. newspapers after &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

The &quot;Post&quot; was founded in 1877. In its early years, it went through several owners and struggled both financially and editorially. In 1933, financier Eugene Meyer purchased it out of bankruptcy and revived its health and reputation; this work was continued by his successors Katharine and Phil Graham, Meyer&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law, respectively, who bought out several rival publications. The &quot;Post&quot; 1971 printing of the Pentagon Papers helped spur opposition to the Vietnam War. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the investigation into the break-in at the Democratic National Committee, which developed into the Watergate scandal and the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon. In October 2013, the Graham family sold the newspaper to Nash Holdings, a holding company owned by Jeff Bezos, for $250 million.

As of 2024, the newspaper had won the Pulitzer Prize 76 times for its work, the second-most of any publication after &quot;The New York Times&quot;. It is considered a newspaper of record in the U.S. &quot;Post&quot; journalists have received 18 Nieman Fellowships and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards. The paper is well known for its political reporting and is one of the few remaining American newspapers to operate foreign bureaus, with international breaking news hubs in London and Seoul.

== Overview ==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; is regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers along with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The &quot;Post&quot; has distinguished itself through its political reporting on the workings of the White House, Congress, and other aspects of the U.S. government. It is considered a newspaper of record in the U.S.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; does not print an edition for distribution away from the East Coast. In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its &quot;National Weekly Edition&quot; due to shrinking circulation. The majority of its newsprint readership is in Washington, D.C., and its suburbs in Maryland and Northern Virginia.

The newspaper&#x27;s 21 foreign bureaus are in Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Cairo, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Istanbul, Jerusalem, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Seoul, Tokyo, and Toronto. In November 2009, the newspaper announced the closure of three U.S. regional bureaus in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City, as part of an increased focus on Washington, D.C.–based political stories and local news. The newspaper has local bureaus in Maryland (Annapolis, Montgomery County, Prince George&#x27;s County, and Southern Maryland) and Virginia (Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun County, Richmond, and Prince William County).

As of March 2023, the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s average printed weekday circulation is 139,232, making it the third largest newspaper in the country by circulation.

For many decades, the &quot;Post&quot; had its main office at 1150 15th Street NW. This real estate remained with Graham Holdings when the newspaper was sold to Jeff Bezos&#x27; Nash Holdings in 2013. Graham Holdings sold 1150 15th Street, along with 1515 L Street, 1523 L Street, and land beneath 1100 15th Street, for $159 million in November 2013. &quot;The Post&quot; continued to lease space at 1150 L Street NW. In May 2014, &quot;The Post&quot; leased the west tower of One Franklin Square, a high-rise building at 1301 K Street NW in Washington, D.C.

Mary Jordan was the founding editor, head of content, and moderator for &quot;Washington Post Live&quot;, The Post&#x27;s editorial events business, which organizes political debates, conferences and news events for the media company, including &quot;The 40th Anniversary of Watergate&quot; in June 2012 that featured key Watergate figures including former White House counsel John Dean, &quot;Washington Post&quot; editor Ben Bradlee, and reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, which was held at the Watergate hotel. Regular hosts include Frances Stead Sellers. Lois Romano was formerly the editor of &quot;Washington Post Live&quot;.

The &quot;Post&quot; has its own exclusive Zip Code, 20071.

== Publishing service ==
Arc XP is a department of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, which provides a publishing system and software for news organizations such as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

== History ==
=== Founding and early period ===
The newspaper was founded in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins (18381912); in 1880, it added a Sunday edition, becoming the city&#x27;s first newspaper to publish seven days a week.

=== 19th century ===
In April 1878, about four months into publication, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; purchased &quot;The Washington Union&quot;, a competing newspaper which was founded by John Lynch in late 1877. The &quot;Union&quot; had only been in operation about six months at the time of the acquisition. The combined newspaper was published from the Globe Building as &quot;The Washington Post and Union&quot; beginning on April 15, 1878, with a circulation of 13,000. The &quot;Post and Union&quot; name was used about two weeks until April 29, 1878, returning to the original masthead the following day.

In 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to Frank Hatton, a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the United States Marine Band, John Philip Sousa, to compose a march for the newspaper&#x27;s essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. It became the standard music to accompany the two-step, a late 19th-century dance craze, and remains one of Sousa&#x27;s best-known works.

In 1893, the newspaper moved to a building at 14th and E streets NW, where it would remain until 1950. This building combined all functions of the newspaper into one headquarters – newsroom, advertising, typesetting, and printing – that ran 24 hours per day.

In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, the &quot;Post&quot; printed Clifford K. Berryman&#x27;s classic illustration &quot;Remember the Maine&quot;, which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in the &quot;Post&quot; – &quot;Drawing the Line in Mississippi&quot;. This cartoon depicts President Theodore Roosevelt showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create the teddy bear. Wilkins acquired Hatton&#x27;s share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton&#x27;s death.

=== 20th century ===

After Wilkins&#x27; death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran the &quot;Post&quot; for two years before selling it in 1905 to John Roll McLean, owner of the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. During the Wilson presidency, the &quot;Post&quot; was credited with the &quot;most famous newspaper typo&quot; in D.C. history according to &quot;Reason&quot; magazine; the &quot;Post&quot; intended to report that President Wilson had been &quot;entertaining&quot; his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been &quot;entering&quot; Mrs. Galt.

When McLean died in 1916, he put the newspaper in a trust, having little faith that his playboy son Edward &quot;Ned&quot; McLean could manage it as part of his inheritance. Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin. He bled the paper for his lavish lifestyle and used it to promote political agendas.

During the Red Summer of 1919 the Post supported the white mobs and even ran a front-page story which advertised the location at which white servicemen were planning to meet to carry out attacks on black Washingtonians.

In 1929, financier Eugene Meyer, who had run the War Finance Corp. since World War I, secretly made an offer of $5 million for the &quot;Post,&quot; but he was rebuffed by Ned McLean. On June 1, 1933, Meyer bought the paper at a bankruptcy auction for $825,000 three weeks after stepping down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He had bid anonymously, and was prepared to go up to $2 million, far higher than the other bidders. These included William Randolph Hearst, who had long hoped to shut down the ailing &quot;Post&quot; to benefit his own Washington newspaper presence.

The &quot;Post&quot; health and reputation were restored under Meyer&#x27;s ownership. In 1946, he was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Philip Graham. Meyer eventually gained the last laugh over Hearst, who had owned the old &quot;Washington Times&quot; and the &quot;Herald&quot; before their 1939 merger that formed the &quot;Times-Herald.&quot; This was in turn bought by and merged into the &quot;Post&quot; in 1954. The combined paper was officially named &quot;The Washington Post and Times-Herald&quot; until 1973, although the &quot;Times-Herald&quot; portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent over time.

The merger left the &quot;Post&quot; with two remaining local competitors, the &quot;Washington Star&quot; (&quot;Evening Star&quot;) and &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot;. In 1972, the two competitors merged, forming the &quot;Washington Star-News.&quot;

Following Graham&#x27;s death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to his wife, Katharine Graham (19172001), who was also Eugene Meyer&#x27;s daughter. Few women had run prominent national newspapers in the United States. In her autobiography, Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence when she stepped into a leadership role. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979.

Graham took The Washington Post Company public on June 15, 1971, in the midst of the Pentagon Papers controversy. A total of 1,294,000 shares were offered to the public at $26 per share. By the end of Graham&#x27;s tenure as CEO in 1991, the stock was worth $888 per share, not counting the effect of an intermediate 4:1 stock split.

Graham also oversaw the Post company&#x27;s diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40 million in 1984. Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the &quot;Post&quot; newspaper as the company&#x27;s leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan accounted for more than 60% of the entire company revenue stream.

Executive editor Ben Bradlee put the newspaper&#x27;s reputation and resources behind reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who, in a long series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate complex in Washington. The &quot;Post&quot; dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of President Richard Nixon, won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.

In 1972, the &quot;Book World&quot; section was introduced with Pulitzer Prize-winning critic William McPherson as its first editor. It featured Pulitzer Prize-winning critics such as Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda, the latter of whom established his career as a critic at the &quot;Post&quot;. In 2009, after 37 years, with great reader outcries and protest, &quot;The Washington Post Book World&quot; as a standalone insert was discontinued, the last issue being Sunday, February 15, 2009, along with a general reorganization of the paper, such as placing the Sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the &quot;Outlook&quot; section and distributing some other locally oriented &quot;op-ed&quot; letters and commentaries in other sections. However, book reviews are still published in the Outlook section on Sundays and in the Style section the rest of the week, as well as online.

In 1975, the pressmen&#x27;s union went on strike. The &quot;Post&quot; hired replacement workers to replace the pressmen&#x27;s union, and other unions returned to work in February 1976.

Donald E. Graham, Katharine&#x27;s son, succeeded her as a publisher in 1979.

In 1995, the domain name washingtonpost.com was purchased. That same year, a failed effort to create an online news repository called Digital Ink launched. The following year it was shut down and the first website was launched in June 1996.

In August 2013, Jeff Bezos purchased &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and other local publications, websites, and real estate for , transferring ownership to Nash Holdings LLC, Bezos&#x27;s private investment company. The paper&#x27;s former parent company, which retained some other assets such as Kaplan and a group of TV stations, was renamed Graham Holdings shortly after the sale.

Nash Holdings, which includes the &quot;Post&quot;, is operated separately from technology company Amazon, which Bezos founded and where he is executive chairman and the largest single shareholder, with 12.7% of voting rights.

Bezos said he has a vision that recreates &quot;the &#x27;daily ritual&#x27; of reading the &quot;Post&quot; as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories...&quot; He has been described as a &quot;hands-off owner&quot;, holding teleconference calls with executive editor Martin Baron every two weeks. Bezos appointed Fred Ryan (founder and CEO of &quot;Politico&quot;) to serve as publisher and chief executive officer. This signaled Bezos&#x27; intent to shift the &quot;Post&quot; to a more digital focus with a national and global readership.

In 2015, the &quot;Post&quot; moved from the building it owned at 1150 15th Street to a leased space three blocks away at One Franklin Square on K Street. Since 2014 the &quot;Post&quot; has launched an online personal finance section, a blog, and a podcast with a retro theme. The &quot;Post&quot; won the 2020 Webby People&#x27;s Voice Award for News &amp; Politics in the Social and Web categories.

In 2017, the newspaper hired Jamal Khashoggi as a columnist. In 2018, Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents in Istanbul.

In October 2023, the &quot;Post&quot; announced it would cut 240 jobs across the organization by offering voluntary separation packages to employees. In a staff-wide email announcing the job cuts, interim CEO Patty Stonesifer wrote, &quot;Our prior projections for traffic, subscriptions and advertising growth for the past two years — and into 2024 — have been overly optimistic&quot;. The &quot;Post&quot; has lost around 500,000 subscribers since the end of 2020 and was set to lose $100 million in 2023, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The layoffs prompted Dan Froomkin of &quot;Presswatchers&quot; to suggest that the decline in readership could be reversed by focusing on the rise of authoritarianism (in a fashion similar to the role the &quot;Post&quot; played during the Watergate scandal) instead of staying strictly neutral, which Froomkin says places the paper into an undistinguished secondary role in competition with other contemporary media. As part of the shift in tone, in 2023 the paper closed down the &quot;KidsPost&quot; column for children, the &quot;Skywatch&quot; astronomy column, and the &quot;John Kelly&#x27;s Washington&quot; column about local history and sights, which had been running under different bylines since 1947.

In May 2024, CEO and publisher William Lewis announced that the organization would embrace artificial intelligence to improve the paper&#x27;s financial situation, telling staff it would seek &quot;AI everywhere in our newsroom.&quot;

In June 2024, Axios reported the &quot;Post &quot;faced significant internal turmoil and financial challenges. The new CEO, Lewis, has already generated controversy with his leadership style and proposed restructuring plans. The abrupt departure of executive editor Buzbee and the appointment of two white men to top editorial positions have sparked internal discontent, particularly given the lack of consideration for the Post&#x27;s senior female editors. Additionally, Lewis&#x27; proposed division for social media and service journalism has met with resistance from staff. Recent reports alleging Lewis&#x27; attempts to influence editorial decisions, including pressuring NPR&#x27;s media correspondent to drop a story about his past ties to a phone hacking scandal, have further shaken the newsroom&#x27;s morale. Lewis continues to grapple with declining revenue and audience on the business front, seeking strategies to regain subscribers lost since the Trump era.

Later that month, the paper ran a story allegedly exposing a connection between incoming editor Robert Winnett and John Ford, a man who &quot;admitted to an extensive career using deception and illegal means to obtain confidential information.&quot; Winnett withdrew from the position shortly thereafter.

In January 2025, the &quot;Post&quot; announced it will layoff 4% of its staff, less than 100 people. Newsroom employees will not be affected.

====Suppression of views Bezos disfavors====
In January 2025, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and published a blog post titled &quot;Why I&#x27;m quitting the Washington Post.&quot; In it, Telnaes criticizes the paper for allegedly refusing to run a cartoon critical of the relationship between American billionaires and President Donald Trump. Telnaes called the decision &quot;dangerous for a free press.&quot; Telnaes&#x27; blog post and the nature of her cartoon sparked conversations about the paper&#x27;s ownership under Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

In February 2025, Bezos announced that the opinion section of the &quot;Post&quot; will give voice only to opinions that support &quot;personal liberties&quot; and &quot;free markets;&quot; but divergent opinions will not be published by the &quot;Post&quot;. David Shipley, &quot;The Post&quot;’s opinion editor, resigned after trying to persuade Jeff Bezos to reconsider the new direction. Within two days of the announcement, it was reported that over 75,000 digital subscribers had canceled their subscriptions.

== Political stance ==
=== 20th century ===
In 1933, financier Eugene Meyer bought the bankrupt &quot;Post&quot;, and assured the public that neither he nor the newspaper would be beholden to any political party. But as a leading Republican who had been appointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve by Herbert Hoover in 1930, his opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal colored the paper&#x27;s editorials and news coverage, including editorializing news stories written by Meyer under a pseudonym. His wife Agnes Ernst Meyer was a journalist from the other end of the spectrum politically. The &quot;Post&quot; ran many of her pieces including tributes to her personal friends John Dewey and Saul Alinsky.

In 1946, Meyer was appointed head of World Bank, and he named his son-in-law Phil Graham to succeed him as &quot;Post&quot; publisher. The post-war years saw the developing friendship of Phil and Kay Graham with the Kennedys, the Bradlees and the rest of the &quot;Georgetown Set&quot;, including many Harvard University alumni that would color the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; political orientation. Kay Graham&#x27;s most memorable Georgetown soirée guest list included British diplomat and communist spy Donald Maclean.

The &quot;Post&quot; is credited with coining the term &quot;McCarthyism&quot; in a 1950 editorial cartoon by Herbert Block. Depicting buckets of tar, it made fun of Sen. Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;tarring&quot; tactics, i.e., smear campaigns and character assassination against those targeted by his accusations. Sen. McCarthy was attempting to do for the Senate what the House Un-American Activities Committee had been doing for years—investigating Soviet espionage in America. The HUAC made Richard Nixon nationally known for his role in the Hiss/Chambers case that exposed communist spying in the State Department. The committee had evolved from the McCormack-Dickstein Committee of the 1930s.

Phil Graham&#x27;s friendship with John F. Kennedy remained strong until their deaths in 1963. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly told the new President Lyndon B. Johnson, &quot;I don&#x27;t have much influence with the &quot;Post&quot; because I frankly don&#x27;t read it. I view it like the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.&quot;

Ben Bradlee became the editor-in-chief in 1968, and Kay Graham officially became the publisher in 1969, paving the way for the aggressive reporting of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; and Watergate scandals. The &quot;Post&quot; strengthened public opposition to the Vietnam War in 1971 when it published the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. In the mid-1970s, some conservatives referred to the &quot;Post&quot; as &quot;&quot;Pravda&quot; on the Potomac&quot; because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials. Since then, the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper.

=== 21st century ===
In the PBS documentary &quot;Buying the War&quot;, journalist Bill Moyers said in the year prior to the Iraq War there were 27 editorials supporting the Bush administration&#x27;s desire to invade Iraq. National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of the administration. According to author and journalist Greg Mitchell: &quot;By the &quot;Post&quot; own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information got lost&quot;.

On March 23, 2007, Chris Matthews said on his television program, &quot;&quot;The Washington Post&quot; is not the liberal newspaper it was [...] I have been reading it for years and it is a neocon newspaper&quot;. It has regularly published a mixture of op-ed columnists, with some of them left-leaning (including E. J. Dionne, Dana Milbank, Greg Sargent, and Eugene Robinson), and some of them right-leaning (including George Will, Marc Thiessen, Michael Gerson and Charles Krauthammer).

Responding to criticism of the newspaper&#x27;s coverage during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, former &quot;Post&quot; ombudsman Deborah Howell wrote: &quot;The opinion pages have strong conservative voices; the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives; and there were editorials critical of Obama. Yet opinion was still weighted toward Obama.&quot; According to a 2009 Oxford University Press book by Richard Davis on the impact of blogs on American politics, liberal bloggers link to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers.

Since 2011, the &quot;Post&quot; has been running a column called &quot;The Fact Checker&quot; that the &quot;Post&quot; describes as a &quot;truth squad&quot;. The Fact Checker received a $250,000 grant from Google News Initiative/YouTube to expand production of video fact checks.

In mid-September 2016, Matthew Ingram of &quot;Forbes&quot; joined Glenn Greenwald of &quot;The Intercept&quot;, and Trevor Timm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in criticizing &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for &quot;demanding that [former National Security Agency contractor Edward] Snowden ... stand trial on espionage charges&quot;.

In February 2017, the &quot;Post&quot; adopted the slogan &quot;Democracy Dies in Darkness&quot; for its masthead.

In February 2025, Jeff Bezos announced that the paper&#x27;s opinion pages would endorse &quot;personal liberties and free markets&quot; to the exclusion of other views. NPR the announcement suggested the &quot;Post&quot; was adopting a libertarian line.

==== Political endorsements ====
In the vast majority of U.S. elections, for federal, state, and local office, the &quot;Post&quot; editorial board has endorsed Democratic candidates. The paper&#x27;s editorial board and endorsement decision-making are separate from newsroom operations. Until 1976, the &quot;Post&quot; did not regularly make endorsements in presidential elections. Since it endorsed Jimmy Carter in 1976, the &quot;Post&quot; has endorsed Democrats in presidential elections, and has never endorsed a Republican for president in the general election, although in the 1988 presidential election, the &quot;Post&quot; declined to endorse either Governor Michael Dukakis (the Democratic candidate) or Vice President George H. W. Bush (the Republican candidate). The &quot;Post&quot; editorial board endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012; Hillary Clinton in 2016; and Joe Biden in 2020. In 2024, the &quot;Post&quot; controversially announced that it would no longer publish presidential endorsements.

While the newspaper predominantly endorses Democrats in congressional, state, and local elections, it has occasionally endorsed Republican candidates. While the paper has not endorsed Republican candidates for governor of Virginia, it endorsed Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for a second term in 2006. In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in Northern Virginia. The &quot;Post&quot; editorial board endorsed Virginia&#x27;s Republican U.S. Senator John Warner in his Senate reelection campaign in 1990, 1996 and 2002; the paper&#x27;s most recent endorsement of a Maryland Republican for U.S. Senate was in the 1980s, when the paper endorsed Senator Charlies &quot;Mac&quot; Mathias Jr. In U.S. House of Representatives elections, moderate Republicans in Virginia and Maryland, including Wayne Gilchrest, Thomas M. Davis, and Frank Wolf, have enjoyed the support of the &quot;Post&quot;; the &quot;Post&quot; also endorsed Republican Carol Schwartz in her campaign in Washington, D.C.

===== 2024 discontinuation of presidential endorsements =====
Eleven days prior to the 2024 presidential election, CEO and publisher William Lewis announced that the &quot;Post&quot; would not endorse a candidate for 2024. It was the first time since the 1988 presidential election that the paper did not endorse the Democratic candidate. Lewis also said that the paper would not make endorsements in any future presidential election. Lewis stated that the paper was &quot;returning to our roots&quot; of not endorsing candidates, and explained that the move was &quot;a statement in support of our readers&#x27; ability to make up their own minds&quot;, and &quot;consistent with the values the &quot;Post&quot; has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects.&quot; Sources familiar with the situation stated that the &quot;Post&quot; editorial board had drafted an endorsement for Kamala Harris, but that it had been blocked by order of the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s owner Jeff Bezos.

The move was criticized by former executive editor Martin Baron, who considered it &quot;disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage&quot;, and suggested that Bezos was fearing retaliation from 2024 Republican candidate Donald Trump that could impact Bezos&#x27;s other businesses if Trump were elected. Editor-at-large Robert Kagan and columnist Michele Norris resigned in the wake of the decision, and editor David Maraniss said that the paper was &quot;dying in darkness&quot;, a reference to the paper&#x27;s current slogan. &quot;Post&quot; opinion columnists jointly authored an article calling the decision to not endorse a &quot;terrible mistake&quot;, and it was condemned by the Washington Post Guild, a union unit representing &quot;Post&quot; employees. More than 250,000 people (about ten percent of the &quot;Post&quot;″s subscribers) cancelled their subscriptions, and three members of the editorial board left the board, though they remain with the &quot;Post&quot; in other positions. An endorsement of Harris was subsequently published by the paper&#x27;s humorist Alexandra Petri, who explained that &quot;if I were the paper, I would be a little embarrassed that it has fallen to me, the humor columnist, to make our presidential endorsement&quot;, and that &quot;I only know what&#x27;s happening because our actual journalists are out there reporting, knowing that their editors have their backs, that there&#x27;s no one too powerful to report on, that we would never pull a punch out of fear.&quot;

Condemning the &quot;Post&quot;″s decision, several columnists, including Will Bunch, Jonathan Last, Dan Froomkin, Donna Ladd and Sewell Chan, described it as an example of what historian Timothy Snyder calls anticipatory obedience. Andrew Koppelman, in an opinion piece for &quot;The Hill&quot;, praised the &quot;Post&quot; for revealing its cowardice. In his book &quot;On Tyranny&quot;, Snyder wrote that &quot;Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. ... [I]ndividuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked&quot;, and he, too, condemned the decision.

== Criticism and controversies ==
=== Gaza war ===
An analysis by The Intercept found that major U.S. newspapers, including the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, exhibited a consistent bias against Palestinians in their coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza. These outlets disproportionately emphasized Israeli deaths, used emotive language to describe Israeli casualties but not Palestinian ones, and focused more on antisemitism in the U.S. than on anti-Muslim racism. The study, which examined over 1,000 articles from the first six weeks of the war, found that Israeli narratives were overwhelmingly favored. Despite the high Palestinian death toll, including thousands of children and journalists, their suffering was underreported and dehumanized compared to coverage of similar events in other conflicts, such as Ukraine. The bias in media representation influences public perception and U.S. political support for Israel, even as younger audiences increasingly turn to social media for alternative narratives.

=== &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s World&quot; fabrication ===

In September 1980, a Sunday feature story appeared on the front page of the &quot;Post&quot; titled &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s World&quot; in which reporter Janet Cooke wrote a profile of the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict. Although some within the &quot;Post&quot; doubted the story&#x27;s veracity, the paper&#x27;s editors defended it, and assistant managing editor Bob Woodward submitted the story to the Pulitzer Prize Board at Columbia University for consideration. Cooke was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing on April 13, 1981. The story was subsequently found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned.

=== Private &quot;salon&quot; solicitation ===
In July 2009, in the midst of an intense debate over health care reform, &quot;The Politico&quot; reported that a health-care lobbyist had received an &quot;astonishing&quot; offer of access to the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; &quot;health-care reporting and editorial staff.&quot; &quot;Post&quot; publisher Katharine Weymouth had planned a series of exclusive dinner parties or &quot;salons&quot; at her private residence, to which she had invited prominent lobbyists, trade group members, politicians, and business people. Participants were to be charged $25,000 to sponsor a single salon, and $250,000 for 11 sessions, with the events being closed to the public and to the non-&quot;Post&quot; press. &quot;Politico&quot;″s revelation gained a somewhat mixed response in Washington as it gave the impression that the parties&#x27; sole purpose was to allow insiders to purchase face time with &quot;Post&quot; staff.

Almost immediately following the disclosure, Weymouth canceled the salons, saying, &quot;This should never have happened.&quot; White House counsel Gregory B. Craig reminded officials that under federal ethics rules, they need advance approval for such events. &quot;Post&quot; Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli, who was named on the flier as one of the salon&#x27;s &quot;Hosts and Discussion Leaders&quot;, said he was &quot;appalled&quot; by the plan, adding, &quot;It suggests that access to &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalists was available for purchase.&quot;

=== &quot;China Daily&quot; advertising supplements ===

Dating back to 2011, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; began to include &quot;China Watch&quot; advertising supplements provided by &quot;China Daily&quot;, an English language newspaper owned by the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party, on the print and online editions. Although the header to the online &quot;China Watch&quot; section included the text &quot;A Paid Supplement to The Washington Post&quot;, James Fallows of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; suggested that the notice was not clear enough for most readers to see. Distributed to the &quot;Post&quot; and multiple newspapers around the world, the &quot;China Watch&quot; advertising supplements range from four to eight pages and appear at least monthly. According to a 2018 report by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;China Watch&quot; uses &quot;a didactic, old-school approach to propaganda.&quot;

In 2020, a report by Freedom House, titled &quot;Beijing&#x27;s Global Megaphone&quot;, criticized the &quot;Post&quot; and other newspapers for distributing &quot;China Watch&quot;. In the same year, 35 Republican members of the U.S. Congress wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice in February 2020 calling for an investigation of potential FARA violations by &quot;China Daily&quot;. The letter named an article that appeared in the &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;Education Flaws Linked to Hong Kong Unrest&quot;, as an example of &quot;articles [that] serve as cover for China&#x27;s atrocities, including ... its support for the crackdown in Hong Kong.&quot; According to &quot;The Guardian,&quot; the &quot;Post&quot; had already stopped running &quot;China Watch&quot; in 2019.

=== Employee relations ===
In 1986, five employees, including &quot;Newspaper Guild&quot; unit chairman Thomas R. Sherwood and assistant Maryland editor Claudia Levy, sued &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for overtime pay, stating that the newspaper had claimed that budgets did not allow for overtime wages.

In June 2018, over 400 employees of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; signed an open letter to the owner Jeff Bezos demanding &quot;fair wages; fair benefits for retirement, family leave and health care; and a fair amount of job security.&quot; The open letter was accompanied by video testimonials from employees, who alleged &quot;shocking pay practices&quot; despite record growth in subscriptions at the newspaper, with salaries rising an average of $10 per week, which the letter claimed was less than half the rate of inflation. The petition followed on a year of unsuccessful negotiations between &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Guild and upper management over pay and benefit increases.

In March 2022, reporter Paul Farhi was suspended for five days without pay after he tweeted about the publication&#x27;s policy on bylines and datelines regarding Russian-based stories.

==== Felicia Sonmez ====

In 2020, &quot;The Post&quot; suspended reporter Felicia Sonmez after she posted a series of tweets about the 2003 rape allegation against basketball star Kobe Bryant after Bryant&#x27;s death. She was reinstated after over 200 &quot;Post&quot; journalists wrote an open letter criticizing the paper&#x27;s decision. In July 2021, Sonmez sued &quot;The Post&quot; and several of its top editors, alleging workplace discrimination; the suit was dismissed in March 2022, with the court determining that Sonmez had failed to make plausible claims.

In June 2022, Sonmez engaged in a Twitter feud with fellow &quot;Post&quot; staffers David Weigel, criticizing him over what he later described as &quot;an offensive joke&quot;, and Jose A. Del Real, who accused Sonmez of &quot;engaging in repeated and targeted public harassment of a colleague&quot;. Following the feud, the newspaper suspended Weigel for a month for violating the company&#x27;s social media guidelines, and the newspaper&#x27;s executive editor Sally Buzbee sent out a newsroom-wide memorandum directing employees to &quot;Be constructive and collegial&quot; in their interactions with colleagues. The newspaper fired Sonmez, writing in an emailed termination letter that she had engaged in &quot;misconduct that includes insubordination, maligning your co-workers online and violating &quot;The Post&quot;″s standards on workplace collegiality and inclusivity.&quot; &quot;The Post&quot; faced criticism from the Post Guild after refusing to go to arbitration over the dismissal, stating that the expiration of the Post&#x27;s contract &quot;does not relieve the Post from its contractual obligation to arbitrate grievances filed prior to expiration.&quot;

=== Lawsuit by Covington Catholic High School student ===

In 2019, Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann filed a defamation lawsuit against the &quot;Post&quot;, alleging that it libeled him in seven articles regarding the January 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation between Covington students and the Indigenous Peoples March. A federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that 30 of the 33 statements in the &quot;Post&quot; that Sandmann alleged were libelous were not, but allowed Sandmann to file an amended complaint as to three statements. After Sandmann&#x27;s lawyers amended the complaint, the suit was reopened on October 28, 2019.

In 2020, &quot;The Post&quot; settled the lawsuit brought by Sandmann for an undisclosed amount.

=== Controversial op-eds and columns ===
Several &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-eds and columns have prompted criticism, including a number of comments on race by columnist Richard Cohen over the years, and a controversial 2014 column on campus sexual assault by George Will.

The &quot;Post&quot;″s decision to run an op-ed by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a leader in Yemen&#x27;s Houthi movement, was criticized by some activists on the basis that it provided a platform to an &quot;anti-Western and antisemitic group supported by Iran.&quot;

The headline of a 2020 op-ed titled &quot;It&#x27;s time to give the elites a bigger say in choosing the president&quot; was changed, without an editor&#x27;s note, after backlash.

In 2022, actor Johnny Depp successfully sued ex-wife Amber Heard for an op-ed she wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; where she described herself as a public figure representing domestic abuse two years after she had publicly accused him of domestic violence.

=== Criticism by elected officials ===
Speaking on behalf of Richard Nixon, White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler infamously accused &quot;The Washington Post&quot; of &quot;shabby journalism&quot; for their focus on Watergate only to apologize when the damning reporting on Nixon was proved correct.

45th/47th president Donald Trump repeatedly spoke out against &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on his Twitter account, having &quot;tweeted or retweeted criticism of the paper, tying it to Amazon more than 20 times since his campaign for president&quot; by August 2018. In addition to often attacking the paper itself, Trump used Twitter to blast various &quot;Post&quot; journalists and columnists.

During the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Senator Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, saying that its coverage of his campaign was slanted against him and attributing this to Jeff Bezos&#x27; purchase of the newspaper. Sanders&#x27; criticism was echoed by the socialist magazine &quot;Jacobin&quot; and the progressive journalist watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. &quot;Washington Post&quot; executive editor Martin Baron responded by saying that Sanders&#x27; criticism was &quot;baseless and conspiratorial&quot;.

=== Fossil fuel advertising ===
An investigation by &quot;The Intercept&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and DeSmog found that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; is one of the leading media outlets that publishes advertising for the fossil fuel industry. Journalists who cover climate change for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; are concerned that conflicts of interest with the companies and industries that caused climate change and obstructed action will reduce the credibility of their reporting on climate change and cause readers to downplay the climate crisis.

<text>The New York Post (NY Post) is an American conservative daily tabloid newspaper published in New York City. The &quot;Post&quot; also operates three online sites: NYPost.com; PageSix.com, a gossip site; and Decider.com, an entertainment site.

The newspaper was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton, a Federalist and Founding Father who was appointed the nation&#x27;s first Secretary of the Treasury by George Washington. The newspaper became a respected broadsheet in the 19th century, under the name New York Evening Post (originally New-York Evening Post). Its most notable 19th-century editor was William Cullen Bryant. 

In the mid-20th century, the newspaper was owned by Dorothy Schiff, who developed the tabloid format that has been used since by the newspaper. In 1976, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp bought the &quot;Post&quot; for US$30.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). 

As of 2023, the &quot;New York Post&quot; is the fourth-largest newspaper by print circulation among all U.S. newspapers.

==History==
===19th century===


The &quot;Post&quot; was founded by Alexander Hamilton with about US$10,000 () from a group of investors in the autumn of 1801 as the &quot;New-York Evening Post&quot;, a broadsheet. Hamilton&#x27;s co-investors included other New York members of the Federalist Party, including Robert Troup and Oliver Wolcott who were dismayed by the election of Thomas Jefferson as U.S. president and the rise in popularity of the Democratic-Republican Party. At a meeting held at Archibald Gracie&#x27;s weekend villa, which is now Gracie Mansion, Hamilton recruited the first investors for the new paper. Hamilton chose William Coleman as his first editor.

The most notable 19th-century &quot;Evening Post&quot; editor was the poet and abolitionist William Cullen Bryant. So well respected was the &quot;Evening Post&quot; under Bryant&#x27;s editorship, it received praise from the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, in 1864.

In addition to literary and drama reviews, William Leggett began to write political editorials for the &quot;Post&quot;. Leggett&#x27;s espoused a fierce opposition to central banking and support for the organization of labor unions. He was a member of the Equal Rights Party. In 1831, he became a co-owner and editor of the &quot;Post&quot;, eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834 and 1835.

One of the co-owners of the paper during this period was John Bigelow. Born in Malden-on-Hudson, New York, Bigelow graduated in 1835 from Union College, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Society and the Philomathean Society, and was admitted to the bar in 1838. From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the &quot;Evening Post&quot;. 

Another owner with Bryan and Bigelow was Isaac Henderson. In 1877, this led to the involvement of his son Isaac Henderson Jr., who became the paper&#x27;s publisher, stockholder, and member of its board, just five years after graduating from college. Henderson Sr.&#x27;s 33-year tenure with the &quot;Evening Post&quot; ended in 1879, when it was learned that he had defrauded Bryant the entire time. Henderson Jr. sold his interest in the newspaper in 1881.

In 1881, Henry Villard took control of the &quot;Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;, which became the &quot;Post&quot;″s weekly edition. With this acquisition, the paper was managed by the triumvirate of Carl Schurz, Horace White, and Edwin L. Godkin. When Schurz left the paper in 1883, Godkin became editor-in-chief. White became editor-in-chief in 1899, and remained in that role until his retirement in 1903.

In 1897, both publications passed to the management of Villard&#x27;s son, Oswald Garrison Villard, a founding member of both the NAACP and the American Anti-Imperialist League.

===20th century===

Villard sold the newspaper in 1918 following widespread allegations of pro-German sympathies during World War I hurt the newspaper&#x27;s circulation. The new owner was Thomas Lamont, a senior partner in the Wall Street firm of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Unable to stem the paper&#x27;s financial losses, he sold it to a consortium of 34 financial and reform political leaders, headed by Edwin Francis Gay, dean of the Harvard Business School, whose members included Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

In 1924, conservative Cyrus H. K. Curtis, publisher of the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, purchased the &quot;Evening Post&quot; and briefly turned it into a non-sensational tabloid nine years later, in 1933. 

In 1928, Wilella Waldorf became drama editor at the &quot;Evening Post&quot;. She was one of the first women to hold an editorial role at the newspaper, During her time at the &quot;Evening Post&quot;, she was the only female first-string critic on a New York newspaper. She was preceded by Clara Savage Littledale, the first woman reporter ever hired by the &quot;Post&quot; and the editor of the woman&#x27;s page in 1914.

In 1934, J. David Stern purchased the paper, changed its name to the &quot;New York Post&quot;, and restored its broadsheet size and liberal perspective. For four months of that same year, future U.S. Senator from Alaska Ernest Gruening was an editor of the paper.

In 1939, Dorothy Schiff purchased the paper. Her husband George Backer was named editor and publisher. Her second editor and third husband Ted Thackrey became co-publisher and co-editor with Schiff in 1942. Together, they recast the newspaper into its modern-day tabloid format.

In 1945, &quot;The Bronx Home News&quot; merged with it. In 1949, James Wechsler became editor of the paper, running both the news and the editorial pages. In 1961, he turned over the news section to Paul Sann and stayed on as editorial page editor until 1980.

Under Schiff&#x27;s tenure the &quot;Post&quot; was seen to have liberal tilt, supporting trade unions and social welfare, and featured some of the most popular columnists of the time, such as Joseph Cookman, Drew Pearson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Max Lerner, Murray Kempton, Pete Hamill, and Eric Sevareid, theatre critic Richard Watts Jr., and gossip columnist Earl Wilson.

In November 1976, it was announced that Australian Rupert Murdoch had bought the &quot;Post&quot; from Schiff with the intention that Schiff would be retained as a consultant for five years. In 2005, it was reported that Murdoch bought the newspaper for US$30.5 million. 

The &quot;Post&quot; at this point was the only surviving afternoon daily in New York City and its circulation under Schiff had grown by two-thirds, particularly after the failure of the competing &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot;; however, the rising cost of operating an afternoon daily in a city with worsening daytime traffic congestion, combined with mounting competition from expanded local radio and TV news cut into the &quot;Post&quot;″s profitability, though it made money from 1949 until Schiff&#x27;s final year of ownership, when it lost $500,000. The paper has lost money ever since.

In late October 1995, the &quot;Post&quot; announced plans to change its Monday through Saturday publication schedule and begin issuing a Sunday edition, which it last published briefly in 1989. 

On April 14, 1996, the &quot;Post&quot; delivered its new Sunday edition at the cost of 50 cents per paper by keeping its size to 120 pages. The amount, significantly less than Sunday editions from &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was part of the &quot;Post&quot;″s efforts &quot;to find a niche in the nation&#x27;s most competitive newspaper market&quot;.

Because of the institution of federal regulations limiting media cross-ownership after Murdoch&#x27;s purchase of WNEW-TV, which is now WNYW, and four other stations from Metromedia to launch the Fox Broadcasting Company, Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for $37.6 million in 1988 (equivalent to $ in ) to Peter S. Kalikow, a real-estate magnate with no experience in the media industry. 

In 1988, the &quot;Post&quot; hired Jane Amsterdam, founding editor of &quot;Manhattan, inc.&quot;, as its first female editor, and within six months the paper had toned down the sensationalist headlines. 

Within a year, Amsterdam was forced out by Kalikow, who reportedly told her &quot;credible doesn&#x27;t sell...Your big scoops are great, but they don&#x27;t sell more papers.&quot;

In 1993, after Kalikow declared bankruptcy, the paper was temporarily managed by Steven Hoffenberg, a financier who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud, and for two weeks by Abe Hirschfeld, who made his fortune building parking garages. 

Following a staff revolt against the Hoffenberg-Hirschfeld partnership, which included publication of an issue whose front page featured the iconic masthead picture of founder Alexander Hamilton with a single teardrop running down his cheek, the &quot;Post&quot; was again purchased in 1993 by Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. This came about after numerous political officials, including Democratic governor of New York Mario Cuomo, persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to grant Murdoch a permanent waiver from the cross-ownership rules that had forced him to sell the paper five years earlier. Without this FCC ruling, the paper would have shut down.

===21st century===
In December 2012, Murdoch announced that Jesse Angelo had been appointed publisher.

Various branches of Murdoch&#x27;s media groups, 21st Century Fox&#x27;s Endemol Shine North America, and News Corp&#x27;s &quot;New York Post&quot; created a &quot;Page Six TV&quot; nightly gossip show based on and named after the Post&#x27;s gossip section. A test run in July would occur on Fox Television Stations. 

The show garnered the highest ratings of a nationally syndicated entertainment newsmagazine in a decade when it debuted in 2017. With &quot;Page Six TV&quot;″s success, the &quot;New York Post&quot; formed New York Post Entertainment, a scripted and unscripted television entertainment division, in July 2018 with Troy Searer as president.

In 2017, the &quot;New York Post&quot; was reported to be the preferred newspaper of U.S. president Donald Trump, who maintains frequent contact with its owner Murdoch. The &quot;Post&quot; promoted Trump&#x27;s celebrity since at least the 1980s. 

In October 2020, the &quot;Post&quot; endorsed Trump for re-election, citing his &quot;promises made, promises kept&quot; policy. 

Weeks after Trump was defeated and sought to overturn the election results, the &quot;Post&quot; published a front-page editorial, asking Trump to &quot;stop the insanity&quot;, stating that he was &quot;cheering for an undemocratic coup&quot;, writing, &quot;If you insist on spending your final days in office threatening to burn it all down, that will be how you are remembered. Not as a revolutionary, but as the anarchist holding the match.&quot; The &quot;Post&quot; characterized Trump attorney Sidney Powell as a &quot;crazy person&quot;, and his former national security advisor Michael Flynn&#x27;s suggestion to declare martial law as &quot;tantamount to treason.&quot;

In January 2021, Keith Poole, a top editor at &quot;The Sun&quot;, another Murdoch-owned tabloid, was appointed as the editor in chief of the &quot;New York Post&quot; Group. Around the same time, at least eight journalists had left the paper.

In January 2025, Tubi released the &quot;New York Post&quot; documentary &quot;New York Post Presents: Luigi Mangione Monster or Martyr?&quot;

==Content, coverage and criticism==
The &quot;Post&quot; has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch&#x27;s ownership for sensationalism, blatant advocacy, and conservative bias. In 1980, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; stated that the &quot;&quot;New York Post&quot; is no longer merely a journalistic problem. It is a social problem—a force for evil.&quot;

The &quot;Post&quot; has been accused of contorting its news coverage to suit Murdoch&#x27;s business needs, in particular avoiding subjects which could be unflattering to the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.

In a 2019 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Ken Auletta wrote that Murdoch &quot;doesn&#x27;t hesitate to use the &quot;Post&quot; to belittle his business opponents&quot;, and went on to say that Murdoch&#x27;s support for Edward I. Koch while he was running for mayor of New York &quot;spilled over onto the news pages of the &quot;Post&quot;, with the paper regularly publishing glowing stories about Koch and sometimes savage accounts of his four primary opponents.&quot;

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign team credited Murdoch and the &quot;Post&quot; for his victory in New York in the 1980 United States presidential election. Reagan later &quot;waived a prohibition against owning a television station and a newspaper in the same market&quot;, allowing Murdoch to continue to control the &quot;New York Post&quot; and &quot;The Boston Herald&quot; while expanding into television.

In 1997, &quot;Post&quot; executive editor Steven D. Cuozzo responded to criticism by saying that the &quot;Post&quot; &quot;broke the elitist media stranglehold on the national agenda.&quot;

In a 2004 survey conducted by Pace University, the &quot;Post&quot; was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it &quot;not credible&quot; than credible (44% not credible to 39% credible).

The &quot;Post&quot; commonly publishes news reports based entirely on reporting from other sources without independent corroboration. In January 2021, the paper forbade the use of CNN, MSNBC, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; as sole sources for such stories.

Susan Mulcahy and Frank DiGiacomo&#x27;s 2024 history was titled &quot;Paper of Wreckage&quot; after staffers&#x27; nickname for the &quot;Post&quot;, which was a pun on the term &#x27;paper of record&#x27;.

=== Style===
Murdoch imported the tabloid journalism style of many of his Australian and British newspapers, such as &quot;The Sun&quot;, which remains one of the highest selling daily newspapers in the United Kingdom. This style was typified by the &quot;Post&quot;″s famous headlines such as &quot;Headless body in topless bar&quot; (written by Vincent Musetto). In its 35th-anniversary edition, &quot;New York&quot; magazine listed this as one of the greatest headlines. It also has five other &quot;Post&quot; headlines in its &quot;Greatest Tabloid Headlines&quot; list.

The &quot;Post&quot; has also been criticized for incendiary front-page headlines, such as one referring to the co-chairmen of the Iraq Study Group—James Baker and Lee Hamilton—as &quot;surrender monkeys&quot;, and another on the murder of landlord Menachem Stark reading &quot;Slumlord found burned in dumpster. Who didn&#x27;t want him dead?&quot;

===Page Six===

The Post&#x27;s influential gossip section Page Six was created in 1977 by James Brady. Beginning in 1985, columnist Richard Johnson edited Page Six for 25 years before British journalist Emily Smith replaced him in 2009. In June 2022, Smith was replaced by her deputy, Ian Mohr. 

February 2006 saw the debut of &quot;Page Six Magazine&quot;, distributed free inside the paper. In September 2007, it started to be distributed weekly in the Sunday edition of the paper. In January 2009, publication of &quot;Page Six Magazine&quot; was cut to four times a year.

Beginning with the 2017–18 television season, a daily syndicated series known as Page Six TV came to air, produced by 20th Television, which was part of the 21st Century Fox side of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s holdings, and Endemol Shine North America. The show was originally hosted by comedian John Fugelsang, with contributions from Page Six and &quot;Post&quot; writers (including Carlos Greer), along with regular panelists Elizabeth Wagmeister from &quot;Variety&quot; and Bevy Smith. In March 2018, Fugelsang left the show, with the expectation that a new host would be named, though by the end of the season, it was announced that Wagmeister, Greer and Smith would be retained as equal co-hosts. In April 2019, it was confirmed that the series would end after May 2019; by then, it was last in average viewership out of all U.S. syndicated newsmagazine programs, behind the similar tabloid-inspired program &quot;Daily Mail TV&quot;.

===Erroneous reporting and defamation cases arising from bombings===

Richard Jewell, a security guard wrongly suspected of being the Centennial Olympic Park bomber, sued the &quot;Post&quot; in 1998, alleging that the newspaper had libeled him in several articles, headlines, photographs, and editorial cartoons. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska largely denied the &quot;Post&quot;″s motion to dismiss, allowing the suit to proceed. The &quot;Post&quot; subsequently settled the case for an undisclosed sum.

In several stories on the day of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the &quot;Post&quot; inaccurately reported that twelve people had died, and that a Saudi national had been taken into custody as a suspect, which was denied by the Boston Police Department. Three days later, on April 18, the &quot;Post&quot; featured a full-page cover photo of two young men at the Boston marathon with the headline &quot;Bag Men&quot; (a term that implies criminality) and erroneously claimed they were being sought by police. The men, Salaheddin Barhoum and Yassine Zaimi, were not considered suspects, and the &quot;Post&quot; was heavily criticized for the apparent accusation. Then-editor Col Allan defended the story, saying they had not referred to the men as &quot;suspects&quot;. The two men later sued the &quot;Post&quot; for libel, and the suit was settled in 2014 on undisclosed terms.

===Accusations of racism===
In 1989, the &quot;Post&quot; described the five black and Latino teenagers arrested following the rape and assault of a white woman in Central Park as coming &quot;from a world of crack, welfare, guns, knives, indifference, and ignorance [...] a land of no fathers&quot;, and having set out &quot;to smash, hurt, rob, stomp, rape&quot; people who were &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. The teenagers&#x27; convictions were later overturned after the confession of a serial rapist, which was confirmed with DNA evidence.

In 2006, several Asian-American advocacy groups protested the use of the headline &quot;Wok This Way&quot; for a &quot;Post&quot; article about U.S. president George W. Bush&#x27;s meeting with Hu Jintao, President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In 2009, the &quot;Post&quot; ran a cartoon by Sean Delonas of a white police officer saying to another white police officer who has just shot a chimpanzee on the street: &quot;They&#x27;ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.&quot; The cartoon dually referred to U.S. president Obama and to the recent rampage of Travis, a former chimpanzee actor. It was criticized as racist, with civil rights activist Al Sharpton calling the cartoon &quot;troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys.&quot;

The Public Enemy song &quot;A Letter to the &quot;New York Post&quot;&quot; from their album &quot;Apocalypse &#x27;91...The Enemy Strikes Black&quot; is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage Black people received from the paper.

In 2019, the &quot;Post&quot; displayed an image of the World Trade Center in flames targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress. The image had been displayed due to Ms. Omar&#x27;s widely criticized quote &quot;Some people did something&quot; which was viewed by many as insensitive and minimizing the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. The Yemeni American Merchant Association announced a formal boycott of the paper and ten of the most prominent Yemeni bodega owners in New York agreed to stop selling the paper. As of June 2019, the boycott had extended to over 900 individual stores. Yemeni-Americans own about half of the 10,000 bodegas in New York City.

=== Hunter Biden laptop story ===

On October 14, 2020, three weeks before the 2020 United States presidential election, the &quot;Post&quot; published a front-page story purporting to reveal &quot;smoking gun&quot; emails recovered from a laptop abandoned by Hunter Biden at a computer repair store in Wilmington, Delaware. The only sources named in the story were Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and strategy advisor Steve Bannon. The story came under heavy criticism from other news sources and anonymous reporters at the &quot;Post&quot; itself for &quot;flimsy&quot; reporting, including questions about the reliability of its sourcing and the lack of outreach to either Hunter Biden or the Joe Biden campaign for pre-publication comment. 

In October 2020, over fifty former U.S. intelligence officials signed an open letter stating that they were &quot;deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role&quot; in the story, but emphasized that &quot;we do not know if the emails... are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement.&quot; The Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said during a Fox News interview that &quot;the intelligence community doesn&#x27;t believe that [the emails originated from Russian disinformation] because there is no intelligence that supports that.&quot; Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist, had previously made public assertions that contradicted professional intelligence assessments.

The FBI took possession of the laptop in late 2019 and reported that they had &quot;nothing to add&quot; to Ratcliffe&#x27;s remarks concerning Russian disinformation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported days after the &quot;Post&quot; story that &quot;no concrete evidence has emerged that the laptop contains Russian disinformation.&quot; 

Amid mounting pressure, the FBI wrote to U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, suggesting it had not found any Russian disinformation on the laptop. It was unclear what Justice Department officials knew about the FBI investigation at the time. Fox News reported that the laptop was seized as part of an investigation into money laundering, but did not make clear if the investigation involved Hunter Biden. 

On December 9, 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that investigators had initially examined possible money laundering by Hunter Biden but did not find evidence to justify further investigation.

Following the 2016 election, social media companies were criticized for allowing false political information to proliferate on their platforms, including from Russian intelligence, suggesting it may have assisted Trump&#x27;s election. Twitter and Facebook initially limited the spread of the 2020 &quot;Post&quot; story on their platforms, citing supposed policies restricting the sharing of hacked material and personal information; Twitter also temporarily suspended the &quot;Post&quot; account. This decision proved controversial, with many critics, including Republican senator Ted Cruz, deriding it as censorship. NPR reported that Twitter initially declined to comment how it reached this decision or what evidence it had supporting this. &quot;The New York Times&quot; initially reported that the story had been pitched to other outlets, including Fox News, which declined to publish it due to concerns over its reliability.

The &quot;Times&quot; also reported that two writers at the &quot;Post&quot; declined to have their names attached to the story, and ultimately the story only listed two bylines, Gabrielle Fonrouge, who &quot;had little to do with the reporting or writing of the article&quot; and was unaware of her byline prior to the story&#x27;s publication, and Emma-Jo Morris, a former producer for Fox News&#x27;s &quot;Hannity&quot; who had no prior bylines with the &quot;Post&quot;. 

In response to the concerns about the veracity of the article, retired &quot;Post&quot; editor-in-chief and current advisor Col Allan responded in an email to the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;the senior editors at &quot;The Post&quot; made the decision to publish the Biden files after several days&#x27; hard work established its merit.&quot; Giuliani said he gave the story to the &quot;Post&quot; because &quot;either nobody else would take it, or if they took it, they would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out.&quot; The accuracy of the Hunter Biden laptop story resulted in increased scrutiny of Twitter and Facebook limiting the spread of the story by conservatives, who argued that their actions &quot;proves Big Tech&#x27;s bias&quot;.

On October 30, 2020, NBC News reported, &quot;no evidence has emerged that the documents are the product of Russian disinformation, as some experts initially suggested, but many questions remain about how the materials got into the hands of Trump&#x27;s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had met with Russian agents in his effort to dig up dirt on Biden.&quot; 

On March 15, 2021, CNN reported that Giuliani and other Trump allies met with Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, who the U.S. government later assessed was a longtime Russian intelligence agent, sanctioning him for distributing disinformation about Joe Biden.

On March 27, 2022, &quot;Vox&quot; reported that no evidence had emerged &quot;that the laptop&#x27;s leak was a Russian plot.&quot; In March 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; confirmed that some of the emails were authentic. In April 2022, the editorial board of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote the Biden laptop story provided &quot;an opportunity for a reckoning&quot; by American media to ensure &quot;accurate and relevant&quot; stories are covered. They noted that:

On April 28, 2022, Joan Donovan, the research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University, said that &quot;This is arguably the most well-known story the &quot;New York Post&quot; has ever published and it endures as a story because it was initially suppressed by social media companies and jeered by politicians and pundits alike&quot;.

===Other controversies===

In 1997, a national news story concerning Rebecca Sealfon&#x27;s victory in the Scripps National Spelling Bee circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the &quot;Daily News&quot;, a direct in-market competitor. The &quot;Post&quot; published a picture of her but altered the photograph to remove the name of the &quot;Daily News&quot; as printed on a placard she was wearing.

In 2004, the &quot;Post&quot; ran a full-page cover photo of 19-year-old New York University student Diana Chien jumping to her death from the twenty-fourth story of a building. University spokesman John Beckman commented &quot;...[I]t seems to show an appalling lack of judgment and insensitivity to the young woman&#x27;s family and a disregard for the feelings of students at NYU&quot;.

In 2012, the &quot;Post&quot; was criticized for running a photograph of a man struggling to climb back up onto a subway platform as a train approached, along with the headline &quot;DOOMED&quot;. Facing questions over why he did not help the man, the photographer claimed he was not strong enough and had been attempting to use the flash on his camera to alert the driver of the oncoming train.

In December 2020, the &quot;Post&quot; published a story outing an emergency medical technician who made additional income from posting explicit photographs of herself to the subscription website OnlyFans. The publication was widely criticized on social media as &quot;doxxing someone simply for trying to earn a living.&quot;

In April 2021, Facebook blocked users from sharing a &quot;Post&quot; story about home real estate purchases by Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors, saying that it violated its privacy and personal information policy. In response, the &quot;Post&quot; argued that it was an arbitrary decision since other newspapers, magazines and websites highlight the real estate purchases of high status individuals. News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern also voiced criticism of the decision, saying in a prepared statement: &quot;There is no balance of power between &#x27;media&#x27; and &#x27;Big Tech.

In April 2021, the &quot;Post&quot; published a false front-page story asserting that copies of a book by vice president Kamala Harris were being distributed to migrant children at an intake facility in Long Beach, California. Fox News then published a story about the matter, followed by numerous Republican politicians and pundits commenting on it, in some cases speculating that taxpayers were funding the supposed book handouts for Harris&#x27;s personal profit. Responding to questions from Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy, White House press secretary Jen Psaki expressed no knowledge of the matter; the &quot;Post&quot; then published a new story headlined &quot;Psaki has no answers when asked about Harris&#x27; book being given to child migrants.&quot; Four days after the original publication, the &quot;Post&quot; replaced the story with a new version clarifying that just one Harris book had been donated by a community member but maintained that it was an &quot;open-arms gesture by the Biden administration,&quot; though there was no evidence of the administration&#x27;s involvement. Laura Italiano, the author of the story, resigned that day, asserting she had been &quot;ordered&quot; to write it.

In October 2022, a rogue employee of the &quot;Post&quot; published a series of racist, violent and sexually explicit headlines on its Twitter account. Shortly after these headlines appeared, a spokesperson for the &quot;Post&quot; stated that the &quot;vile and reprehensible&quot; headlines were the result of a hack and were immediately removed, and that the incident was under investigation. The spokesperson later stated that &quot;the unauthorized conduct was committed by an employee, and the employee has been terminated.&quot;

In May 2023, amid reports that a wave of migrants might soon cross the American southern border, the &quot;Post&quot; ran a front-page story stating that 20 homeless veterans had been ordered to vacate upstate New York hotels to make room for arriving migrants. Fox News and other conservative outlets sent the story viral, with numerous conservatives expressing outrage at President Joe Biden and other Democrats. The story was soon found to have been fabricated by a local veterans advocate.

While attending a June 2024 G7 Summit in Italy, G7 leaders watched an exhibition of military parachutists jump from aircraft and land nearby. After the exhibition, President Joe Biden stepped away from the group to approach some parachutists to speak and give them a thumbs-up. The &quot;Post&quot; tweeted a cropped version of a video that did not show the parachutists, creating a false impression that Biden had wandered off in confusion. The paper ran a full front-page story the next day, asserting &quot;Biden embarrasses US with confused wanderings at world conference.&quot; Fox News ran a segment on the &quot;Post&quot; story, displaying the front-page on air. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; factchecker assigned the story Four Pinocchios, designating it as an outright lie.

In September 2024, the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; found that several of the &quot;New York Post&quot;″s stories about Wisconsin politics had been authored by an individual with no clear previous journalism experience and extensive ties to the state&#x27;s Republican Party. These included two recent 2024 stints completing consulting work for that party; 2023 consulting work for Dan Kelly, a conservative state Supreme Court candidate; and being the campaign manager for a state Assembly campaign in 2024.

==Claim of being the oldest daily newspaper in the U.S.==
The &quot;New York Post&quot; was established in 1801 making it the oldest daily newspaper in the U.S. However it is not the oldest continuously published paper; as the &quot;New York Post&quot; halted publication during strikes in 1958 and in 1978. If this is considered, &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; is the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the U.S. 

The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; is generally understood to be the oldest newspaper in America, as it was founded in 1764; however, it was founded as a semi-weekly paper and did not begin publishing daily until 1836, 35 years after the &quot;New York Post&quot; began doing so.

==Operations==

The 1906 Old New York Evening Post Building is a designated landmark. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It occupied the building until 1926 when a new main office for the &quot;Post&quot; was established at 75 West Street in the New York Evening Post Building. The building remained in use by the &quot;Post&quot; until 1970, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. In 1967, Schiff bought 210 South Street, the former headquarters of the &quot;New York Journal American&quot;, which closed a year earlier. The building became an instantly recognizable symbol for the &quot;Post&quot;. 

In 1995, owner Rupert Murdoch relocated the &quot;Post&quot;″s news and business offices to the News Corporation headquarters tower at 1211 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) in midtown Manhattan. The &quot;Post&quot; shares this building with Fox News Channel and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, which are also owned by Murdoch. Both the &quot;Post&quot; and the New York City edition of the &quot;Journal&quot; are printed at a state-of-the-art printing plant in The Bronx.

The Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union has delivered the newspaper &quot;since the early 1900s.&quot;

===Website===
In 1996, the &quot;New York Post&quot; launched an Internet version of the paper.

===&quot;Decider&quot;===

The &quot;New York Post&quot; launched the website &quot;Decider&quot; in 2014 to provide recommendations for streaming services. The website&#x27;s first and only editor-in-chief is Mark Graham. Graham said that this service would &quot;strike a nice balance between visual imagery and the written word, and come from a place of pop culture omniscience.&quot;

In 2019, Decider signed a deal with app provider &quot;Reelgood&quot; to provide Reelgood widget links at the bottom of each review and would channel some advertising revenue to both companies. The value of the deal was not disclosed.

===Sales===
The daily circulation of the &quot;Post&quot; decreased in the final years of the Schiff era from 700,000 around 1967–68, to approximately 517,000 by the time she sold the paper to Murdoch in 1976. 

Under Murdoch, the &quot;Post&quot; launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1978, prompting the &quot;Daily News&quot; to retaliate with a PM edition called &quot;Daily News Tonight&quot;. But the PM edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon &quot;Post&quot; experienced and the &quot;Daily News&quot; ultimately folded &quot;Tonight&quot; in 1981. By that time, circulation of the all-day &quot;Post&quot; soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition (It set a single-day record of 1.1 million on August 11, 1977, with the news of the arrest the night before of David Berkowitz, the infamous &quot;Son of Sam&quot; serial killer who terrorized New York for much of that summer). However, the &quot;Post&quot; lost so much money that Murdoch decided to shut down the &quot;Post&quot;″s PM edition in 1982, turning the &quot;Post&quot; into a morning-only daily.

The &quot;Post&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot; have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. A resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw &quot;Post&quot; circulation rise to 724,748 by April 2007, achieved partly by lowering the price from 50 cents to 25 cents. 

In October 2006, the &quot;Post&quot; surpassed the &quot;Daily News&quot; in circulation for the first time, only to see the &quot;Daily News&quot; overtake its rival a few months later. In 2010, the &quot;Post&quot;″s daily circulation was 525,004, just 10,000 behind the &quot;Daily News&quot;. 

, the &quot;Post&quot; was the fourth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation, while the &quot;Daily News&quot; was ranked eighth.

The &quot;Post&quot; has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976, and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that &quot;Post&quot; loses up to $70 million a year. One commentator suggested that the &quot;Post&quot; cannot become profitable as long as the competing &quot;Daily News&quot; survives, and that Murdoch may be trying to force the &quot;Daily News&quot; to fold or sell out, leaving the two papers in an intractable war of attrition.

In September 2022, &quot;The New York Post&quot; became profitable, posting a profit for the quarter and year to date.

The &quot;Post&quot; digital network reached approximately 198 million unique users in June 2022, compared to 123 million in the prior year.

<doc id="102229" wikidata="Q213956" url="?curid=102229" title="Gustav Vigeland">
<text>Gustav Vigeland (11 April 1869 – 12 March 1943), born as Adolf Gustav Thorsen, was a Norwegian sculptor. Gustav Vigeland occupies a special position among Norwegian sculptors, both in the power of his creative imagination and in his productivity. He is most associated with the Vigeland installation (&quot;Vigelandsanlegget&quot;) in Frogner Park, Oslo. He was also the designer of the Nobel Peace Prize medal.

==Early life==
Adolf Gustav Thorsen was born to a family of craftsmen, just outside Halse og Harkmark, a former municipality in Mandal. His parents were Elesæus Thorsen (1835–1886), a cabinetmaker and Anne Aanensdatter (1835–1907). He had three brothers, of whom Emanuel Vigeland (originally Thorsen) became a noted artist. As a youth, he was sent to Oslo where he learned wood carving at a local school. However, the sudden death of his father compelled him to move back to Mandal to help his family. Gustav lived for a time with his grandparents on a farm called Mjunebrokka in Vigeland, an old farm in Valle parish, Lindesnes municipality in Vest-Agder county.

He returned to Oslo in 1888, this time determined to become a professional sculptor. He came to the attention of sculptor Brynjulf Bergslien, who supported him and gave him practical training. The following year he exhibited his first work, &quot;Hagar and Ishmael&quot;. In his 20s, he adopted the new family name Vigeland, from the area where he had briefly lived.

Vigeland spent the years 1891 to 1896 in several voyages abroad, including Copenhagen, Paris, Berlin and Florence. In the French capital he frequented Auguste Rodin&#x27;s workshop, while in Italy he experimented with ancient and Renaissance artworks. In these years the themes that would later dominate his inspiration - death and the relationship between man and woman - first appeared. He held his first personal exhibitions in Norway in 1894 and 1896, which received notable critical praise.

==Early public works==
Until 1902 Vigeland was engaged in the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. The contact with Mediaeval art contributed to another frequent theme in Vigeland&#x27;s art, the dragon as symbol of sin but also as a nature force, fighting against man.

Back in Oslo, he obtained from the town an abandoned studio in which to work. In 1905 Norway became independent from Sweden. Vigeland, considered the most talented Norwegian sculptor, received numerous commissions for statues and busts celebrating renowned compatriots like Henrik Ibsen and Niels Henrik Abel.

In 1906 Vigeland proposed a chalk model for a monumental fountain. Initially, the idea of the Oslo municipality was to put the fountain in Eidsvolls plass, the square in front of the Parliament of Norway. His work was generally welcomed, but the location created a dispute: completion of the work was postponed by the dispute. In the meantime Vigeland enlarged the original project, adding several sculpture groups. The high granite column was added to the design in 1919.

==Vigeland installation==

Gustav Vigeland is most widely known for the Vigeland installation, a permanent sculpture installation in Frogner Park in Oslo.

In 1921 the City of Oslo decided to demolish the house where Vigeland lived and build a library. After a long dispute, Vigeland was granted a new building from the city where he could work and live; in exchange, he promised to donate to the city all his subsequent works, including sculptures, drawings, engravings and models.

Vigeland moved to his new studio on Nobels gate in the borough of Frogner during 1924. His studio was located in the vicinity of Frogner Park, which he had chosen as the definitive location for his fountain. Over the following twenty years, Vigeland was devoted to the project of an open exhibition of his works, which later turned into what is known as Vigeland Sculpture Arrangement (&quot;Vigelandsanlegget&quot;) in Frogner Park. The Vigeland installation features 212 bronze and granite sculptures all designed by Gustav Vigeland. The sculptures culminate in the famous Monolith (&quot;Monolitten&quot;), with its 121 figures struggling to reach the top of the sculpture.

==Vigeland Museum==

Vigeland lived and worked at his studio on Nobels gate until his death in 1943. His ashes are still preserved there in the belfry of the building. According to the agreement with the City of Oslo, the building became the Vigeland Museum (&quot;Vigelandsmuseet&quot;).

The site is located immediately south of the Vigeland Sculpture Arrangement. Vigeland&#x27;s flat on the third floor was preserved as a part of the museum which houses various works by the artist, along with the plaster models of the Vigeland sculptures in Frogner Park.

==Legacy==
Some art critics considered Vigeland&#x27;s sculptures to be expressions of nazi or fascist aesthetics, and he has been compared to Arno Breker. Writing in Verdens Gang, a newspaper started by former Norwegian resistance members shortly after the German occupation of Norway ended in 1945, Pola Gauguin wrote that the Vigeland installation &quot;reeks of Nazi mentality.” The works in the installation depict individuals variously possessed: In agony and shock; Rapture and torture, from birth to death and beyond. The assessment of Strømodden finds no political themes. 

&quot;Posterity&quot;, a 2015 play by Doug Wright, imagined the interaction between Vigeland and Henrik Ibsen.

<text>The Washington Naval Treaty, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, was signed during 1922 among the major Allies of World War I, which agreed to prevent an arms race by limiting naval construction. It was negotiated at the Washington Naval Conference in Washington, D.C. from November 1921 to February 1922 and signed by the governments of the British Empire (including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India), United States, France, Italy, and Japan. It limited the construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers by the signatories. The numbers of other categories of warships, including cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, were not limited by the treaty, but those ships were limited to 10,000 tons displacement each.

The treaty was finalized on February 6, 1922. Ratifications of it were exchanged in Washington on August 17, 1923, and it was registered in the &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on April 16, 1924.

Later conferences on naval arms limitation sought additional limitations of warship building. The terms of the Washington Naval Treaty were modified by the London Naval Treaty of 1930 and the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. By the mid-1930s, Japan and Italy had renounced the treaties, while Germany renounced the Treaty of Versailles which had limited its navy. Naval arms limitation became increasingly difficult for the other signatories.

Immediately after World War I, Britain still had the world&#x27;s largest and most powerful navy, followed by the United States and, more distantly, by Japan, France and Italy. The British Royal Navy interned the defeated German High Seas Fleet in November 1918. The Allies had differing opinions concerning the final disposition of the Imperial German Navy, with the French and Italians wanting the German fleet divided between the victorious powers and the Americans and British wanting the ships destroyed. The negotiations became mostly moot after the German crews scuttled most of their ships on 21 June 1919.

News of the scuttling angered the French and the Italians, with the French particularly unimpressed with British explanations that the fleet guarding the Germans had then been away on exercises. Nevertheless, the British joined their allies in condemning the German actions, and no credible evidence emerged to suggest that the British had collaborated with the Germans with respect to the scuttling. The Treaty of Versailles, signed a week later on 28 June 1919, imposed strict limits on the sizes and numbers of warships which the newly-installed German government had the right to build and maintain.

The Americans, British, French, Italians, and Japanese had been allies during World War I, but with the German threat seemingly finished, a naval arms race between the erstwhile allies seemed likely. US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s administration had already announced successive plans for the expansion of the US Navy from 1916 to 1919 that would have resulted in a massive fleet of 50 modern battleships.

In response, the Japanese Diet in 1920 finally authorised construction of warships to enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to attain its goal of an &quot;eight-eight&quot; fleet programme, with eight modern battleships and eight battlecruisers. The Japanese started work on four battleships and four battlecruisers, all of which were much larger and more powerful than those of the classes that they were replacing.

The 1921 British Naval Estimates planned four battleships and four battlecruisers, with another four battleships to follow the subsequent year.

The new arms race was unwelcome to the American public. The US Congress disapproved of Wilson&#x27;s 1919 naval expansion plan, and the 1920 presidential election campaign resulted in politicians in Washington resuming the non-interventionalism of the prewar era, with little enthusiasm for continued naval expansion. Britain also could ill afford the exorbitant cost of capital ships.

In late 1921, the US became aware that Britain was planning a conference to discuss the strategic situation in the Pacific and Far East regions. To forestall the British plan and to satisfy domestic demands for a global disarmament conference, Warren Harding&#x27;s administration called the Washington Naval Conference in November 1921.

The Conference agreed to the Five-Power Naval Treaty as well as a Four-Power Treaty on Japan and a Nine-Power Treaty on China.

==Negotiations==
At the first plenary session held November 21, 1921, US Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes presented his country&#x27;s proposals. Hughes provided a dramatic beginning for the conference by stating with resolve: &quot;The way to disarm is to disarm&quot;. The ambitious slogan received enthusiastic public endorsement and likely abbreviated the conference while helping ensure his proposals were largely adopted. He subsequently proposed the following:
* A ten-year pause or &quot;holiday&quot; of the construction of capital ships (battleships and battlecruisers), including the immediate suspension of all building of capital ships.
* The scrapping of existing or planned capital ships to give a 5:5:3:1.67:1.67 ratio of tonnage with respect to Britain, the United States, Japan, France and Italy respectively.
* Ongoing limits of both capital ship tonnage and the tonnage of secondary vessels with the 5:5:3 ratio.

===Capital ships===
The proposals for capital ships were largely accepted by the British delegation. However, they were controversial with the British public. Britain could no longer have adequate fleets in the North Sea, the Mediterranean and the Far East simultaneously, which provoked outrage from parts of the Royal Navy.

Nevertheless, there was huge demand for the British to agree to the limits and reductions: the risk of war with the Americans was increasingly regarded as merely theoretical as there were very few policy differences between the two Anglophone powers; continued naval spending was unpopular in Britain throughout the empire; and Britain was implementing major budget reductions due to the post–World War I recession.

The Japanese delegation was divided. Japanese naval doctrine required the maintenance of a fleet 70% the size of that of the United States, which was felt to be the minimum necessary to defeat the Americans in any subsequent war. The Japanese envisaged two separate engagements, first with the U.S. Pacific Fleet and then with the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. It calculated that a 7:5 ratio in the first battle would produce enough of a margin of victory to be able to win the subsequent engagement and so a 3:5 ratio was unacceptable because a 3:5 total fleet size ratio would imply a 6:5 ratio in the first battle. Nevertheless, the director of the delegation, Katō Tomosaburō, preferred to accept the latter to the prospect of an arms race with the United States, as the relative industrial strength of the two nations would cause Japan to lose such an arms race and possibly suffer an economic crisis. At the beginning of the negotiations, the Japanese had only 55% of the capital ships and 18% of the GDP of the Americans.

His opinion was opposed strongly by Katō Kanji, the president of the Naval Staff College, who acted as his chief naval aide at the delegation and represented the influential &quot;big navy&quot; opinion that Japan had to prepare as thoroughly as possible for an inevitable conflict against the United States, which could build more warships because of its superior industrial might.

Katō Tomosaburō was finally able to persuade the Japanese high command to accept the Hughes proposals, but the treaty was for years a source of controversy in the navy.

The French delegation initially responded negatively to the idea of reducing their capital ships&#x27; tonnage to 175,000 tons and demanded 350,000, slightly above the Japanese limit. In the end, concessions regarding cruisers and submarines helped persuade the French to agree to the limit on capital ships.

Another issue that was considered critical by the French representatives was the Italian request of substantial parity, which was considered to be unsubstantiated; however, pressure from the American and the British delegations caused the French to accept it. That was considered a great success by the Italian government, but parity would never actually be attained.

There was much discussion about the inclusion or exclusion of individual warships. In particular, the Japanese delegation was keen to retain their newest battleship &quot;Mutsu&quot;, which had been funded with great public enthusiasm, including donations from schoolchildren. That resulted in provisions to allow the Americans and the British to construct equivalent ships.

===Cruisers and destroyers===
Hughes proposed to limit secondary ships (cruisers and destroyers) in the same proportions as capital ships. However, that was unacceptable to both the British and the French. The British counterproposal, in which the British would be entitled to 450,000 tons of cruisers in consideration of its imperial commitments but the United States and Japan to only 300,000 and 250,000 respectively, proved equally contentious. Thus, the idea of limiting total cruiser tonnage or numbers was rejected entirely.

Instead, the British suggested a qualitative limit of future cruiser construction. The limit proposed, of a 10,000 ton maximum displacement and 8-inch calibre guns, was intended to allow the British to retain the &quot;Hawkins&quot; class, then being constructed. That coincided with the American requirements for cruisers for Pacific Ocean operations and also with Japanese plans for the &quot;Furutaka&quot; class. The suggestion was adopted with little debate.

===Submarines===
A major British demand during the negotiations was the complete abolition of the submarine, which had proved so effective against them in the war. That proved impossible, particularly as a result of French opposition, which demanded an allowance of 90,000 tons of submarines, and the conference ended without an agreement to restrict submarines.

===Pacific bases===
Article XIX of the treaty also prohibited the British, the Japanese and the Americans from constructing any new fortifications or naval bases in the Pacific Ocean region. Existing fortifications in Singapore, the Philippines and Hawaii could remain. That was a significant victory for Japan, as newly-fortified British or American bases would be a serious problem for the Japanese in the event of any future war. That provision of the treaty essentially guaranteed that Japan would be the dominant power in the Western Pacific Ocean and was crucial in gaining Japanese acceptance of the limits on capital ship construction.

==Terms==
The treaty strictly limited both the tonnage and construction of capital ships and aircraft carriers and included limits of the size of individual ships.

The tonnage limits defined by Articles IV and VII (tabulated) gave a strength ratio of approximately 5:5:3:1.75:1.75 for the UK, the United States, Japan, Italy, and France, respectively.

The qualitative limits of each type of ship were as follows:
*Capital ships (battleships and battlecruisers) were limited to 35,000 tons standard displacement and guns of no larger than 16-inch calibre. (Articles V and VI)
*Aircraft carriers were limited to 27,000 tons and could carry no more than 10 heavy guns, of a maximum calibre of 8 inches. However, each signatory was allowed to use two existing capital ship hulls for aircraft carriers, with a displacement limit of 33,000 tons each (Articles IX and X). For the purposes of the treaty, an aircraft carrier was defined as a warship displacing more than 10,000 tons constructed exclusively for launching and landing aircraft. Carriers lighter than 10,000 tons, therefore, did not count towards the tonnage limits (Article XX, part 4). Moreover, all aircraft carriers then in service or building (&quot;Argus&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Furious&quot;, &quot;Hermes&quot;, &quot;Langley&quot; and &quot;Hōshō&quot;) were declared &quot;experimental&quot; and could be replaced without regard to their age, unlike other capital ships (Article VIII).
*All other warships were limited to a maximum displacement of 10,000 tons and a maximum gun calibre of 8 inches (Articles XI and XII).

The treaty also detailed by Chapter II the individual ships to be retained by each navy, including the allowance for the United States to complete two further ships of the &quot;Colorado&quot; class and for the UK to complete two new ships in accordance with the treaty limits (the &quot;Nelson&quot; class).

Chapter II, part 2, detailed what was to be done to render a ship ineffective for military use. In addition to sinking or scrapping, a limited number of ships could be converted as target ships or training vessels if their armament, armour and other combat-essential parts were removed completely. Some could also be converted into aircraft carriers.

Part 3, Section II specified the ships to be scrapped to comply with the treaty and when the remaining ships could be replaced. In all, the United States had to scrap 30 existing or planned capital ships, Britain 23 and Japan 17.

==Effects==

The treaty marked the end of a long period of increases of battleship construction. Many ships that were being constructed were scrapped or converted into aircraft carriers. Treaty limits were respected and then extended by the London Naval Treaty of 1930. It was not until the mid-1930s that navies began to build battleships once again, and the power and the size of new battleships began to increase once again. The Second London Naval Treaty of 1936 sought to extend the Washington Treaty limits until 1942, but the absence of Japan or Italy made it largely ineffective.

There were fewer effects on cruiser building. The treaty specified 10,000 tons and 8-inch guns as the maximum size of a cruiser, but that was also the minimum size cruiser that any navy was willing to build. The treaty began a building competition of 8-inch, 10,000-ton &quot;treaty cruisers&quot;, which gave further cause for concern. Subsequent naval treaties sought to address that by limiting cruiser, destroyer and submarine tonnage.

Unofficial effects of the treaty included the end of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Although it was not part of the Washington Treaty in any way, the American delegates had made it clear that they would not agree to the treaty unless the British ended their alliance with the Japanese. The 1921 Imperial Conference earlier in the year had already decided not to renew the Alliance.

==Violations==
In 1935, the French Navy laid down the battleship ; combined with the two s also under construction, which placed the total tonnage over the 70,000-ton limit on new French battleships until the expiration of the treaty. The keel laying of in December 1936, albeit less than three weeks before the treaty expired, increased the magnitude of France&#x27;s violation by another 35,000 tons. The French government dismissed British objections to the violations by pointing out that Britain had signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1935, which unilaterally dismantled the naval disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. German naval rearmament threatened France, and according to the French perspective, if Britain freely violated treaty obligations, France would similarly not be constrained.

Italy repeatedly violated the displacement limits on individual ships and attempted to remain within the 10,000-ton limit for the s built in the mid-1920s. However, by the s in the late 1920s and early 1930s, it had abandoned all pretense and built ships that topped by a wide margin. The violations continued with the s of the mid-1930s, which had a standard displacement in excess of . The Italian Navy nevertheless misrepresented the displacement of the vessels as being within the limits imposed by the treaty.

===Loopholes===
Several powers attempted to exploit loopholes in the treaty, though it is arguable whether these were technically violations of the treaty. 

The Japanese light aircraft carrier &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was an effort to exploit the definition of an aircraft carrier as being &quot;a vessel of war with a displacement in excess of 10,000 tons&quot;, by building a carrier of less than 10,000 tons, which would not be restricted by the treaty. However, the ship was not large enough to be fully capable, and was later expanded to be over 10,000 tons total. This loophole was closed by the London Naval Treaty, so no ships besides &quot;Ryūjō&quot; ever attempted this approach. 

The American conversions of &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; from battlecruisers to carriers was supposed to be done with a tonnage of no more than 33,000 tons, as conversions. However, the ships were overweight, so the US took advantage of the rules for reconstructing ships to add an additional 3,000 tons of weight limit to them for anti-air/anti-submarine defenses, arguing that they were being &quot;reconstructed&quot; as they were being constructed. No other power ever attempted to make this argument. 

The British &quot;Nelson&quot; class took advantage of the fact that the definition of tonnage excluded fuel and reserve boiler feed water. Anti-torpedo defense systems were most effective with liquid layers to absorb the shock of a torpedo strike, however liquids are quite heavy. By building their torpedo defenses such that the water within was usable as reserve boiler feed water, this weight was not counted towards the displacement limit of the ships, thus allowing stronger torpedo defenses than would otherwise have been practical.

==Japanese denunciation==

The naval treaty had a profound effect on the Japanese. With superior American and British industrial power, a long war would very likely end in a Japanese defeat. Thus, gaining strategic parity was not economically possible.

Many Japanese considered the 5:5:3 ratio of ships as another snub by the West, but it can be argued that the Japanese had a greater force concentration than the US Navy or the Royal Navy. The terms also contributed to controversy in high ranks of the Imperial Japanese Navy between the Treaty Faction officers and their Fleet Faction opponents, who were also allied with the ultranationalists of the Japanese army and other parts of the Japanese government. For the Treaty Faction, the treaty was one of the factors that had contributed to the deterioration of the relationship between the American and the Japanese governments.

Some have also argued that the treaty was one major factor in prompting Japanese expansionism by the Fleet Faction in the early 1930s. The perception of unfairness resulted in Japan&#x27;s renunciation of the Second London Naval Treaty in 1936.

Isoroku Yamamoto, who later masterminded the attack of Pearl Harbor, argued that Japan should remain in the treaty. His opinion was more complex, however, in that he believed the United States could outproduce Japan by a greater factor than the 5:3 ratio because of the huge American production advantage of which he had expert knowledge since he had served with the Japanese embassy in Washington. After the signing of the treaty, he commented, &quot;Anyone who has seen the auto factories in Detroit and the oil-fields in Texas knows that Japan lacks the power for a naval race with America.&quot; He later added, &quot;The ratio works very well for Japan – it is a treaty to restrict the other parties.&quot; He believed that other methods than a spree of construction would be needed to even the odds, which may have contributed to his advocacy of the plan to attack Pearl Harbor.

On December 29, 1934, the Japanese government gave formal notice that it intended to terminate the treaty. Its provisions remained in force formally until the end of 1936 and were not renewed.

==Influences of cryptography==

What was unknown to the participants of the Conference was that the American &quot;Black Chamber&quot; (the Cypher Bureau, a US intelligence service), commanded by Herbert Yardley, was spying on the delegations&#x27; communications with their home capitals. In particular, Japanese communications were deciphered thoroughly, and American negotiators were able to get the absolute minimum possible deal that the Japanese had indicated they would ever accept.

As the treaty was unpopular with much of the Imperial Japanese Navy and with the increasingly active and important ultranationalist groups, the value that the Japanese government accepted was the cause of much suspicion and accusation among Japanese politicians and naval officers.

<text>Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Ribic (born 1974) is a Canadian who fought in the Bosnian Serb Army where he was also known as Nikola Ribić. In 1995, he took four United Nations peacekeepers hostage and used them as a human shield to try to force a halt to the ongoing bombing of Serb-held territories in Bosnia by NATO forces.

He was the first Canadian to be prosecuted for a hostage-taking committed outside the country. Ribic was charged under a section of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; of Canada on jurisdiction that had never been used before that allows Canada to claim jurisdiction over kidnapping and hostage-taking offences outside of the country when a Canadian perpetrator or victim is involved.

Ribic&#x27;s hostage was a fellow Canadian, Capt. Patrick Rechner, working in Bosnia as an unarmed U.N. military observer. The May 1995 worldwide television and newspaper coverage showed the photo of Capt. Rechner chained to a lightning rod at an ammunition bunker in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale. Ribic was in the uniform of a Bosnian Serb soldier, wielding an AK47 rifle, in the company of other Serb soldiers. Held for 24 days, the photo of Capt. Rechner became a symbol of the United Nations&#x27; incapacity to deal with Serb military offensives.

==Hostage taking==
Ribic travelled to Republika Srpska in 1992, ostensibly because he &quot;want[ed] to fight Muslims&quot;. There he joined the Bosnian Serb Army as a volunteer. On May 24, 1995, British General Rupert Smith, leading a United Nations contingent, warned both the Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Serbs in Pale to cease street fighting and shelling, or risk an air strike from NATO aircraft. The Serbian faction ignored the warning and was hit by a retaliatory airstrike which dropped two bombs on their base ten kilometres south of the city the next day.

The day after the bombs were dropped, it is alleged that Ribic and other Bosnian Serbs walked into the United Nations office with AK-47s and took several staff members hostage, including Russians Capt. Zidlik and Capt. Pavel Teterevsk, and Canadian Capt. Patrick Rechner. They demanded that Major Guy Lavender phone Smith, and subsequently warned the General that bombing of Serb targets had to cease or the hostages would be killed.

The hostages were taken to the Serbian base south of the city, where Rechner was handcuffed to a lightning rod outside a warehouse being used to store mortar rounds. Ribic then allegedly phoned the United Nations and warned that &quot;The three UN observers are at the site of the warehouse. Any more bombings, they&#x27;ll be the first to go.&quot; The prisoners were noted to have been &quot;treated well&quot; during their confinement, and were voluntarily returned to the United Nations office on June 18.

==Arrest and subsequent trials==
In 2000, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police traced Ribic down to his new home in Germany, and he was arrested in February. Nine months later, he was extradited to face charges in Canada, where he was defended by lawyer D&#x27;Arcy DePoe.

Ribic&#x27;s trial began in Ottawa, Ontario on October 8, 2002. The trial however unraveled three months later when judge Douglas Cunningham of the Supreme Court of Ontario declared a mistrial on 20 January 2003, after only nine days of testimony.
Ribic was retried in 2005 for hostage taking and allegedly threatening death. His lawyer, D&#x27;Arcy DePoe, called it &quot;one of the most unusual criminal trials in Canadian history&quot; as it was the first time a Canadian had been tried in this manner. &quot;While this is an unusual form of trespass, it is submitted that NATO dropping 2,000-pound bombs on this property was clearly a trespass.&quot;

This time, there was no mistrial declared and Ribic was convicted and found guilty of hostage taking and threatening death and sentenced to three years in prison. Two witnesses from the Canadian Armed Forces, known only as Witness A and Witness B, were only allowed to testify by transcript during Ribic&#x27;s 2005 trial.

In 2008, Ribic appealed the decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal. Ribic&#x27;s attorney DePoe objected to the fact that the two witnesses from the Canadian Armed Forces were only allowed to testify by transcript.

The court rejected Ribic&#x27;s appeal, concluding that Ribic had no connection to the ammunition bunkers that entitled him to defend them from trespassing and that the trial judge&#x27;s handling of Witness A and Witness B was acceptable.

<doc id="102243" wikidata="Q3186699" url="?curid=102243" title="Go professional">
<text>A Go professional is a professional player of the game of Go. The minimum standard to acquire a professional diploma through one of the major Go organisations is very high. The competition is tremendous, and prize incentives for champion players are very large. For example, the Honinbo Tournament has a grand prize of about $350,000.

Almost all professional players are from China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This is because until recently, only China (China Qiyuan), Japan (Nihon Ki-in, Kansai Ki-in), South Korea (Korea Baduk Association (Hanguk Gi-Won)), and Taiwan (Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation) had professional Go organizations. In 2012, the AGA Professional System was established in the United States. In 2014, the EGF professional system was established in Europe.

Professional rankings are separate from the amateur ratings (usually &quot;30-kyu&quot; through &quot;7-dan&quot;). Professional rankings are &quot;1-dan&quot; through &quot;9-dan&quot; (sometimes written &quot;1p&quot; through &quot;9p&quot;). In the past, a&quot; 1-dan&quot; professional was roughly equal to a (European) &quot;7-dan&quot; amateur. However, since the competition to become a professional has increased since the late 1990s (particularly in China and Korea), it has become the case that new&quot; 1-dan&quot; professionals are much stronger than they usually were in the past.

There have also been professional Go players from the West competing in East Asian professional associations, specifically Romania, Austria, Germany, Russia, Hungary, Australia, Finland and the United States of America.

==Reaching professional level==

Professional dan rankings are normally awarded in Japan, China, South Korea or Taiwan, through one of the professional Go associations. The attainment of professional qualification differs in different countries:
* In China, a few amateurs are given the 1p grade as probationers, on the basis of success in amateur tournaments.
* In Japan, student professionals are called &quot;insei&quot;, and have to play in internal insei competitions to qualify; mostly they are adolescents, and must decide whether to continue based on their chances of a career in Go, or go to university. Insei rarely take part in amateur events, but some of the top amateurs are ex-insei.
* In South Korea, four amateurs become professional every year, at the top of a ferocious league system of 80 aspiring pros. Once within the professional system, promotion is based on game results.
* In Europe, the strongest players qualify or are invited to compete in a Qualification Tournament, with the top one or two players being awarded the rank of 1-dan professional. Seven such tournaments have taken place since 2014 with nine players having been granted professional status. Professional players can advance in rank by earning so-called &quot;low dan points&quot; and &quot;high dan points&quot; for beating other professionals in tournaments, competing in international tournaments and winning titles.

Most professional players begin studying Go seriously when they are children, commonly reaching professional status in their mid to late teens. Some rare students achieve professional status at a much earlier age, such as Sumire Nakamura and Cho Chikun.

In order to qualify as a first-dan professional (1p), one must have deep resources of game experience and study. In local positions, professionals are often on close ground with each other, understanding good shape, tesuji, life and death, fuseki and joseki patterns. However, in global positions they often differ in &quot;positional judgement&quot;—the global impact and interaction of josekis and differing importance of various parts of the board during the opening and middle game.

==Discrepancies among professionals==
The strength differences between professional levels is usually considered to be no more than 2–3 handicap stones. Therefore, the difference between professional dan levels corresponds to about one-third to one-fourth of a handicap stone.

Each country has different rules for promotion. Ranks may, therefore, differ somewhat from country to country.

Professionals may also differ in actual strength for a number of reasons, such as promotion not keeping up with actual gains in strength, or the fact that professional ranks (unlike kyu or amateur dan) may rise, but never fall (even if the player grows weaker). This has posed some problems, esp. with regards to international rank discernment. There are currently over one hundred people who have the rank of 9p (the highest professional rank), though many of them no longer play competitively. A further distinction is that some 9p players regularly hold titles, others won some titles, some entered the title leagues, and many 9p never had the fortune to achieve any of the above.

Traditionally it has been uncommon for a low professional dan to beat some of the highest pro dans. But since the late-1990s it has slowly become more common. This trend has been primarily credited to the result of increased competition to become a professional player in China and Korea. The result, that new &quot;1-dan&quot; professionals are generally stronger than other &quot;1 dans&quot; in the past.

In Japan, the &quot;Oteai&quot; system was reformed in 2004. The goal was to help alleviate some of the rank inflation that had crept in over the years. Today&#x27;s Japanese system uses various benchmarks; for example, winning certain tournaments or a certain number of games, to be promoted by a rank. The Korean and Chinese systems have also been similarly changed in the past several years. These systems have increased the importance of international tournaments by incentivising rank promotion through international placement. Recent criticism has been given to this aspect, arguing that an individual may increase many professional ranks at once through the virtue of a single competition result (such as Piao Wenyao).

==Pro and amateur dan==
In theory, professional dans should beat all levels of amateur dans. In reality, the very top amateurs have proven very able. The conventional wisdom is that such players may achieve some of the insight of a pro, though perhaps not the detailed knowledge.

In China, Korea, and Japan, there are two distinct ranking sets, one for amateur players and one for professional players (who receive a fee for each game they play, bonuses for winning, and fees for other related activities such as teaching).

In the Japanese professional ranking system, distinction between ranks was traditionally considered to be roughly one third of a handicap stone (making the difference 3 pro dan equal to one amateur dan). The strength of new professionals (1-dan) was usually comparable to that of the highest ranked amateurs. Currently the professional ranks are assumed to be more bunched together, covering not much more than two amateur dans; so that pro 1 dans win some games against 9 dans. There are also a number of amateur players acknowledged as having pro 6 dan understanding of the game.

In South Korea, there are several amateur systems in use, with the recent introduction of official 7-, 6- and 5-dan amateur ranks, each of which is somewhat stronger than the corresponding European grade. A 7-dan amateur will have won three national events, and will be effectively of lower-ranked pro standard. The older gup system does not easily match others. In practice, in Korean clubs, grades may be worked out against the resident strongest amateur.

The Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation also employs a dan system similar to that in Japan. It ranks its professional players from beginner dan (初段) up to 9-dan, being the highest. However, the amateur ranking system is established by another organization which certifies amateur player through competitions, ranking player from beginner dan (初段) to 6-dan with 7-dan being honorary.

In Germany and the Netherlands a &quot;classes&quot;-system (German: &quot;Klassen&quot;) was established by Go pioneer Bruno Rüger in 1920. It comprised a further subdivision into Kyu/Dan half-grades with classes 18 and 17 = amateur 1-dan with the 17 being on the stronger side. It was replaced by the Japanese amateur ranking system in the 1970s.

== European Professional System ==
A European professional system was established by the European Go Federation in 2014, with sponsorship from &quot;CEGO&quot;, a partnership of Chinese investors interesting in promoting the game of go in Europe. The aims of the system are to &quot;give the strongest players a chance to compete on the same level as the Asian pro players&quot;, &quot;attract more media attention and therefore also attract more sponsors.&quot; Any player holding a European passport and having been a citizen of an EGF-member country for at least 10 years is eligible, providing they are not already a professional player belonging to another professional association.

The EGF also supports an &quot;EGF Academy&quot; that provides high-level training to the strongest young players in Europe. The Academy is a collaboration between the EGF, CEGO and the Ge Yuhong Go Academy in Beijing. Tuition is provided by both European and Asian professionals, and includes exchange programs allowing students to travel to China to study.

The first Pro Qualification Tournament was held in three European cities in the same year as the system&#x27;s launch, and resulted in first Pavol Lisý of Slovakia and secondly Ali Jabarin of Israel emerging as the most successful players and thus the first two European professional players. A summary of all Qualification Tournaments is given below.

Professional players in Europe receive various benefits. They gain automatic qualification to prestigious European tournaments, including the Grand Slam that has the largest prize pool in Europe (the overall champion won €10,000 in 2021). Furthermore, they are provided with opportunities to compete in Professional Go Leagues organised by the EGF since 2020, which are reserved only to professional players and also offer high prize pools. During major European tournaments, professional players are also paid to provide live commentary of games.

=== Professional Players of the EGF ===
Seven qualification tournaments have resulted in nine European players being awarded professional status by the EGF. Promotion details of each player are given below.

<doc id="102251" wikidata="Q1392" url="?curid=102251" title="Battle of Nieuwpoort">
<text>The Battle of Nieuwpoort (also known as the Battle of the Dunes) was fought on 2 July 1600 during the Eighty Years War and the Anglo-Spanish war in the dunes near Nieuwpoort. An Anglo-Dutch army met a Spanish force head-on which, although their left flank nearly broke, were able to assail them with both infantry and cavalry. The Spanish gradually scattered in all directions and left their guns on the field.

==Background==
The battle pitted the military leaders of both of the Netherlands (the Dutch Republic and the Habsburg Netherlands) against each other: The armies of the Dutch Republic were commanded by Maurice, Count of Nassau; the armies of the Habsburg Netherlands were commanded by Albert, Duke of Burgundy. Albert ruled autocratically, Maurice had to abide by the demands of the Dutch parliament. Both commanded multinational armies, though the Spanish army was entirely Catholic while the Dutch army was predominantly Protestant.

Maurice (1567–1624) was the son of the leader of the original Dutch rebellion, William of Orange. He had been fighting from an early age. During the previous five years, he had set in motion a military revolution by completely reforming the Dutch army, introducing new concepts of drill and standard commands, and combining them with standardization and thorough bookkeeping. This created a dependable, predictable, maneuverable and steadfast army, with high continuous firepower, deadly cavalry, and experienced officers high and low.

Albert (1559–1621) was son of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. His uncle, brother-in-law, and father-in-law was King Philip II of Spain. Albert ruled the Royal Netherlands with his spouse, Philip&#x27;s daughter Isabella. He had little military experience. The Spanish army was as experienced as the Dutch, as were its officers, except for several of the highest in command. During Albert&#x27;s absence in 1598–99, getting married in Spain, the Spanish army had been led by Mendoza, aka the Admiral of Aragon.

Ambition had grown Mendoza&#x27;s army to beyond the territory&#x27;s financial means. As a result, units had not been paid in a long time. Exacerbated by Albert&#x27;s policy to promote bloodline over merit and to break up new regiments to reinforce older, mutiny had become commonplace. Several mutineer ‘republics’ had sprung up along the Dutch border, Diest the biggest. One new regiment even mutinied the moment it arrived from southern Europe and was told it would be broken up; it then camped around Hamont.

==To Dunkirk==
Maurice used these setbacks to capture several important border forts. Chief among those was the brand new and very strong fort Crevecoeur (north of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, part of previous year&#x27;s ambitious plans). Its men had mutinied but stayed loyal to the King of Spain. After a two month siege, and despite Spanish relief efforts, it surrendered in May 1600, with full honours intact. Maurice had offered them the pay they were still due by Spain, plus service in the Dutch army, all of which they accepted.

The relatively easy victory convinced the Dutch government to try something bigger. Dunkirk was the Spaniards main port in the north. It inflicted a lot of damage on Dutch merchants and fishermen. Maintaining a permanent blockade was quite expensive. Capturing it would also give the Dutch a bargaining chip with France and England. It was an ambitious target though and two earlier attempts (1594, 1595) to land an army close by had failed. A safer tactic was to use Dutch-held Ostend to the north as a base of operation. Only two obstacles remained between the two ports: Fort Albert just south of Ostend, and the port city of Nieuwpoort. It was decided to land an army right in front of Nieuwpoort, take it and the fort, and then march to Dunkirk.

The time was right for an operation deep inside enemy territory. Apart from Spanish mutiny issues, Ostend was being slowly encircled by forts. It was only a matter of time before Albert would lay siege to it: so using Ostend as a base was a matter of now or never. Maurice and the military didn’t agree on Dunkirk however. They’d much rather focus on Sluis, the Spanish galley port north of Ostend. Maurice knew the area well, after landings in 1586, 1591, and two in 1593. Sluis was closer to the Republic and important to control the sea access of major trade centre Antwerp. The government overruled the military however: it was to be Dunkirk.

==Maurice&#x27;s campaign==

For this operation, by 21 June Maurice had collected an army of twelve infantry regiments and 25 troops of cavalry: some 12,000 Foot and 2,000 Horse. The following day he crossed the Scheldt Estuary in a multitude of small vessels and moved to Ostend, his base of operations; there he left a half regiment and four troops to reinforce the garrison and, on 30 June, started for Nieuwpoort.

When Maurice arrived in front of the place on 1 July, he sent two thirds of his force across the Yser River to blockade it from the West. That night, while he was making preparations for a regular siege, he received news that the Archduke was close at hand with a field army; knowing that he was cut off from his base, he ordered his cousin Ernst Casimir (Ernst Casimir I of Nassau-Dietz) to delay with a force the advancing Spanish troops, while he was bringing the best part of his army to cross again the Yser and rejoin the rest, to face the Archduke: he had no option left but to present battle, or risk a potentially disastrous retreat by sea.

Ernst Casimir - commanding the Edmonds (Scottish) and the Van der Noot (Dutch) regiments, together with four troops of cavalry and two guns - was ordered to seize the Leffinghen bridge but, as he arrived, he found the Spanish already in its possession; Ernst deployed his force behind a ditch, hoping to fight a delaying action, but the Spaniards were already in great strength across the bridge and charged right home, piercing his centre routing the infantry at once while his cavalry fled in panic. Over 600 Scots were killed, with five out of the twelve company commanders being killed on the field and another two executed by the Spanish afterwards. The Dutch fared only slightly better, taking refuge in Ostend: for all purposes, Ernst&#x27;s command had ceased to exist.

After that cheap victory, the Archduke held a conference with his captains. Most urged to entrench the army across the road to Ostend, forcing Maurice to attack along a narrow front where the Dutch cavalry, mostly heavy, would not be effective against the lighter Spanish cavalry. However, the mutineers, who had been rallied by the Archduke on the promise of free plunder, were eager for a fight and out-argued the rest. The army therefore advanced in battle order along the coast; it was midday and the tide was coming in, so that in the end they were forced to abandon the shrinking beach and climb slowly up the slippery dunes. Maurice just had time to assemble his whole army to face the Archduke.

==Battle==

Maurice had posted his best regiments in a strong defensive position on top of a stretch of dunes, with guns covering both flanks with enfilade fire. Under the command of the experienced Francis Vere the English, who composed of one third of the States Army (some twenty four companies in total) were the first line of infantry and were placed on this stretch of dunes, and awaited the Spanish army to arrive.

The Spanish sent a screen of 500 harquebusiers to cover their advance; but soon the two unruly mutineer regiments in the vanguard started the attack with a rash charge up the hill. They were repulsed in disorder, while the light cavalry, counter-charged by the Dutch cuirassiers, were routed. It was then time for the second line of the Spanish infantry to advance. The Sapena and Ávila Tercios made quick progress against the Frisian regiment on the Dutch right, and Maurice sent his entire second line to protect that sector, stabilising the front.

Meanwhile offshore an Anglo-Dutch fleet had moved close to the shore and bombarded the Spanish positions supporting the land forces. Maurice then sent his entire cavalry against the Spanish flank, except for the small body of cavalry in the second line that he kept in reserve behind the infantry. The Dutch cuirassiers easily routed the lighter Spanish cavalry, and the mutineer cavalry, that had just rallied, fled the battlefield never to return. However, the Dutch were checked by the Spanish third line of infantry, supported by some guns, and retreated with heavy losses.

Meanwhile, on the Dutch left, the English regiments faced the veteran tercios of Monroy and Villar; the elite of the Spanish infantry. The English, well drilled in Maurice&#x27;s new tactics, kept a rolling fire on the Spaniards who advanced up the slope at a steady pace, covered by a screen of skirmisher harquebusiers. The fight was even for a time, until it came to the push of pike, the Spanish finally dislodging the English from the top of the hill. Francis Vere, seeing the risk of a disordered collapse of the English line, asked for reinforcements, but they did not arrive in time and the English were finally routed. However, the Spanish, exhausted after a day of fighting and marching on difficult terrain, pressed their advantage very slowly. Even more dangerously, they were disordered, with musket and pike units mixed. Noticing this, Maurice sent his reserve cavalry against them, only three troops strong. Their well-timed charge was unexpectedly very successful. The Spanish were thrown into confusion and started a slow retreat. Vere, who had been able to rally some English companies behind a battery, joined the fight, and he was reinforced by the regiments in the third line that had finally arrived. Finally Vere sent his own cavalry against the Spanish who were now heavily assailed and retreated in disorder.

On the Dutch right, the Archduke had committed his third line into the assault. Maurice saw his chance and asked his tired cavalry for one last effort. Under the command of his cousin Louis, another charge was delivered and the Spanish cavalry was finally driven from the field. The Spanish infantry, already engaged at the front, was this time unable to repulse the attack on their flank and started to give ground. After a while, the front crumbled and, one after another, all units were running in confusion, leaving behind their guns. The survivors scattered in all directions, but the inactivity of the Dutch garrison in Ostend allowed the Spanish army to avoid total destruction.

==Aftermath==

Spanish losses were high; in total from 2,500 to 4,000 killed and wounded and included some 600 taken prisoner. Many officers were lost and casualties were suffered by the elite units of the second line, veteran soldiers who were very hard to replace. The artillery train was also lost, while ninety Spanish standards were captured, while the Scots and Zeeland colours lost at Leffinghe were recaptured. Allied losses were also high - they amounted from 1,700 to 2,700 - these included the casualties at Leffinghen. British forces who bore the brunt of the Spanish attack suffered heavy losses of nearly 600 men, but was proof to the Dutch of their reliability in battle.

Maurice&#x27;s army remained in Nieuwpoort for fourteen days, and although his army had driven a Spanish army from the field, a rare feat at the time, the battle achieved little beyond that. The Dutch did not proceed to occupy or even invest Dunkirk, which had been the principal objective of the campaign. Their lines of communication had already been stretched to the limit and Maurice was soon forced to withdraw from the territory of the Spanish Netherlands. The Flemish, whom Maurice had hoped to rally to his revolt, proved loyal to the Spanish monarchy. Dunkirkers would continue to prey on Dutch and English trade. Instead the allied army proceeded to Ostend, where it captured a large Spanish fort named &#x27;Isabella&#x27;.

Strategically, the lesson drawn from this battle was that it was more advantageous to besiege and capture towns than to attempt to win in the open field. This would increasingly characterise operations in the Eighty Years&#x27; War thenceforth. While Maurice&#x27;s army had beaten a Spanish army, his reformed infantry had been dislodged from a strong defensive position by the Spanish infantry using its traditional methods, and it was only his cavalry that had saved him from defeat. The Battle of Nieuwpoort is considered to be the first challenge to the dominance of the tercios in sixteenth and seventieth century warfare. Spanish experts were quick to notice Maurice&#x27;s innovation in tactics - furthermore there was even an adoption in the increase of light mounted troops in the Spanish army.

News of the victory reached England; Elizabeth I was overjoyed - she repeatably said to her courtiers that Vere was, &#x27;the worthiest captain of our time&#x27;. In addition several ballads entertained the English public after news of victory had broken. Meanwhile Isabella bore disappointment on news of the defeat but was relieved to find that her husband the Archduke had escaped the rout.
