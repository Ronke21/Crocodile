<text>The Kyrgyz people (also spelled Kyrghyz, Kirgiz, and Kirghiz; or ) are a Turkic ethnic group native to Central Asia. They primarily reside in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and China. A Kyrgyz diaspora is also found in Russia, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan. They speak the Kyrgyz language, which is the official language of Kyrgyzstan.

The earliest people known as &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; were the descendants of several Central Asian tribes, first emerging in western Mongolia around 201 BC. Modern Kyrgyz people are descended in part from the Yenisei Kyrgyz that lived in the Yenisey river valley in Siberia. The Kyrgyz people were constituents of the Tiele people, the Göktürks, and the Uyghur Khaganate before establishing the Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate in the 9th century, and later a Kyrgyz khanate in the 15th century.

== Etymology ==
There are several theories on the origin of ethnonym &quot;Kyrgyz&quot;. It is often said to be derived from the Turkic word &quot;kyrk&quot; (&quot;forty&quot;), with -&quot;iz&quot; being an old plural suffix, so &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; literally means &quot;a collection of forty tribes&quot;. It also means &quot;imperishable&quot;, &quot;inextinguishable&quot;, &quot;immortal&quot;, &quot;unconquerable&quot; or &quot;unbeatable&quot;, as well as its association with the epic hero Manas, who – according to a founding myth – unified the 40 tribes against the Khitans. A rival myth, recorded in 1370 in the &quot;History of Yuan&quot;, concerns 40 women born on a steppe motherland.
The earliest records of the ethnonym appear to have been the Chinese transcriptions &quot;Gekun&quot; (, LH *&quot;kek-kuən&quot; &lt; Old Chinese: *&quot;krêk-kûn&quot;) and &quot;Jiankun&quot; (, LH *&quot;ken-kuən&quot; &lt; OC: *&quot;kên-kûn&quot;). Those suggest that the original ethnonym was *&quot;kirkur ~ kirgur&quot; and/or *&quot;kirkün&quot;, and another transcription &quot;Jiegu&quot; (, EMC: *&quot;kέt-kwət&quot;) suggests *&quot;kirkut / kirgut&quot;. Yury Zuev proposed that the ethnonym possibly means &#x27;field people, field Huns&#x27; (cf. Tiele tribal name 渾 &quot;Hún&quot; &lt; MC *&quot;ɣuən&quot;). Peter Golden reconstructs *&quot;Qïrğïz&quot; &lt; *&quot;Qïrqïz&quot;&lt; *&quot;Qïrqïŕ&quot; and suggests a derivation from Old Turkic &quot;qır&quot; &#x27;gray&#x27; (horse color) plus suffix &quot;-q(X)r/ğ(X)r&quot; ~ &quot;k(X)z/g(X)z&quot;. Besides, Chinese scholars later used a number of different transcriptions for the Kyrgyz people: these include &quot;Gegu&quot; (紇骨), &quot;Jiegu&quot; (結骨), &quot;Hegu&quot; (紇骨), &quot;Hegusi&quot; (紇扢斯), &quot;Hejiasi&quot; (紇戛斯), &quot;Hugu&quot; (護骨), &quot;Qigu&quot; (契骨), or &quot;Juwu&quot; (居勿), and then, during the reign of Tang Emperor Wuzong, &quot;Xiajiasi&quot; (黠戛斯), said to mean &quot;red face&quot;. Edwin G. Pulleyblank surmises that &quot;red face&quot; was possibly a folk etymology provided by an interpreter who explained the ethnonym based on Turkic &quot;qïzïl&quot; ~ &quot;qizqil&quot;, meaning &#x27;red&#x27;. By the time of the Mongol Empire, the ethnonym&#x27;s original meaning had apparently been forgotten – as was shown by variations in readings of it across different reductions of the &quot;History of Yuan&quot;. This may have led to the adoption of &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; and its mythical explanation.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, European writers used the early Romanized form &quot;Kirghiz&quot; – from the contemporary Russian – to refer not only to the modern Kyrgyz, but also to their more numerous northern relatives, the Kazakhs. When distinction had to be made, more specific terms were used:
the Kyrgyz proper were known as the &quot;Kara-Kirghiz&quot; (&quot;Black Kirghiz&quot;, from the colour of their tents),
and the Kazakhs were named the or &quot;Kirghiz-Kazak&quot;.

== Origins ==

The Kyrgyz are a Turkic ethnic group. Recent linguistic, genetic and archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest Turkic peoples descended from agricultural communities in Northeast China who moved westwards into Mongolia in the late 3rd millennium BC, where they adopted a pastoral lifestyle. By the early 1st millennium BC, these peoples had become equestrian nomads. In subsequent centuries, the steppe populations of Central Asia appear to have been progressively Turkified by an East Asian dominant minority moving out of Mongolia.

The Yenisei Kyrgyz, whose 9–10th century migration to the Tienshan area was of &quot;particularly great importance for the formative process&quot; of the Kyrgyz, have their origins in the western parts of modern-day Mongolia and first appear in written records in the Chinese annals of the Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (compiled 109-91 BCE) as &quot;Gekun&quot; (, ) or &quot;Jiankun&quot; (). The Middle Age Chinese composition &quot;Tang Huiyao&quot; of the 8–10th century transcribed the name &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; as &quot;Jiegu&quot; (Kirgut), and their tamga was depicted as identical to the tamga of the present-day Kyrgyz tribes Azyk, Bugu, Cherik, Sary Bagysh and a few others.

The 11th-century New Book of Tang described the Kyrgyz (結骨) with red hair, white skin, and green eyes. Contemporary Persian writer Gardizi recounted a legend that ascribed these traits to Saqaliba ancestry in the tribe.
The Yenisei Kyrgyz lived in the upper Yenisey River valley, central Siberia. In late antiquity, the Yenisei Kyrgyz were a part of the Tiele people. Later, in the Early Middle Ages, the Yenisei Kyrgyz were a part of the confederation of the Göktürks and the Uyghur Khaganate.

In 840, a revolt led by the Yenisei Kyrgyz brought down the Uyghur Khaganate, and brought the Yenisei Kyrgyz to a dominating position in the former Second Turkic Khaganate. With the rise to power, the center of the Kyrgyz Khaganate moved to Jeti-su, and brought about a spread south of the Kyrgyz to Tian Shan and Xinjiang, bringing them into contact with the existing peoples of what is now Western China, especially the Tibetan Empire.

The khagans of the Yenisei Kirghiz Khaganate claimed descent from the Han Chinese general Li Ling, which was mentioned in the diplomatic correspondence between the Kirghiz khagan and the Tang dynasty emperor, since the Tang imperial Li family claimed descent from Li Ling&#x27;s grandfather, Li Guang. The Kirghiz qaghan assisted the Tang dynasty in destroying the Uyghur Khaganate and rescuing the Princess Taihe from the Uyghurs. They also killed a Uyghur khagan in the process.

Then Kyrgyz quickly moved as far as the Tian Shan range and maintained their dominance over this territory for about 200 years. In the 12th century, however, Kyrgyz domination had shrunk to the Altai and Sayan Mountains as a result of Mongol expansion. With the rise of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the Kyrgyz migrated south. In 1207, after the establishment of &quot;Yekhe Mongol Ulus&quot; (Mongol empire), Genghis Khan&#x27;s oldest son Jochi occupied Kyrgyzstan without resistance. The state remained a Mongol vassal until the late 14th century. Various Turkic peoples ruled them until 1685, when they came under the control of the Oirats (Dzungars), which lasted until 1757. Many Kyrgyz tribes that had fled the Dzungars returned to modern Kyrgyzstan at this time.
By the 16th century, the carriers of the ethnonym &quot;Kirgiz&quot; lived in South Siberia, Xinjiang, Tian Shan, Pamir-Alay, Middle Asia, Urals (among Bashkirs), and in Kazakhstan. In the Tian Shan and Xinjiang area, the term &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; retained its unifying political designation, and became a general ethnonym for the Yenisei Kirgiz and aboriginal Turkic tribes that presently constitute the Kyrgyz population. Though it is impossible to directly identify the Yenisei and Tien Shan Kyrgyz, a trace of their ethnogenetical connections is apparent in archaeology, history, language and ethnography. A majority of modern researchers came to the conclusion that the ancestors of Kyrgyz tribes had their origin in the most ancient tribal unions of Sakas/Scythians, Wusun/Issedones, Dingling, Mongols, and Huns.

18th-century Qing administrators referred to the Kyrgyz by the name &quot;Bulute&quot;.

The oldest notes about a definite mention of the Kyrgyz ethnonym originate from the 6th century. There is a certain probability that there was relations between Kyrgyz and Gegunese already in the 2nd century BC and between Kyrgyz and Khakas since the 6th century AD, but there is a missing unique mention. The Kyrgyz as an ethnic group are mentioned quite unambiguously during the time of Genghis Khan&#x27;s rule (1162–1227), when their name replaces the former name Khakas.

=== Genetics ===

The genetic makeup of the Kyrgyz is consistent with their origin as a mix of tribes. For instance, 63% of modern Kyrgyz men of Jumgal District are Haplogroup R1a1. Low diversity of Kyrgyz R1a1 indicates a founder effect within the historical period. Other groups of Kyrgyz especially Southwest Kyrgyz show considerably lower haplogroup R frequencies and almost lack haplogroup N (except for the Kyrgyz from Pamir).

Depending on the geographical location of samples, West Eurasian mtDNA haplogroup lineages make up 27% to 42.6% in the Kyrgyz, with haplogroup mtDNA H being the most predominant West Eurasian mtDNA haplogroup at about 14.2% (range 8.3% Talas to 21.3% Sary-Tash) among the Kyrgyz. However, the majority of Kyrgyz belong to East Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups, with mtDNA haplogroup D (approx. 20.2%, range 14.6% Talas to 25.5% Sary-Tash) and D4 in particular (approx. 18.5%) being the most frequent Eastern Eurasian lineage among them.

A 2011 study of autosomal ancestry found that East Eurasian ancestry is predominant in most Kyrgyz living in Kyrgyzstan. East Eurasian ancestry makes up roughly two-thirds with exceptions of Kyrgyz living in Tajikistan and the western areas of Kyrgyzstan, where it forms only half.

A 2022 study and report found that Kyrgyz people from China were found to have more West Eurasian ancestry than the Kyrgyz from Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyz people from China clustered more closely with Europeans and South Asians.

== Religion ==

Kyrgyz are predominantly Muslims of the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam. Islam was first introduced by Arab traders who travelled along the Silk Road in the 7th and 8th centuries. In the 8th century, orthodox Islam reached the Fergana Valley with the Uzbeks. However, in the 10th-century Persian text &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;Alam&quot;, the Kyrgyz were still described as a people who &quot;venerate the Fire and burn the dead&quot;.

The Kyrgyz began to convert to Islam in the mid-17th century. Sufi missionaries played an important role in the conversion. By the 19th century, the Kyrgyz were considered devout Muslims and some performed the Hajj.

Atheism has some following in the northern regions under Russian communist influence. A few cultural rituals of Shamanism are practiced to this day, particularly in Central Kyrgyzstan. During a July 2007 interview, Bermet Akayeva, the daughter of Askar Akayev, the former President of Kyrgyzstan, stated that Islam was increasingly taking root, even in the northern regions which had been under communist influence. She emphasized that many mosques have been built and that the Kyrgyz are &quot;increasingly devoting themselves to Islam&quot;.

Many ancient indigenous beliefs and practices, including shamanism and totemism, coexisted syncretically with Islam. Shamans, most of whom are women, still play a prominent role at funerals, memorials, and other ceremonies and rituals. This split between the northern and southern Kyrgyz in their religious adherence to Muslim practices can still be seen today. Likewise, the Sufi order of Islam has been one of the most active Muslim groups in Kyrgyzstan for more than a century.

==Outside Kyrgyzstan==
=== Afghanistan ===
The Kyrgyz population of Afghanistan was 1,130 in 2003, all from eastern Wakhan District in the Badakhshan Province of northeastern Afghanistan. They still lead a nomadic lifestyle and are led by a &quot;khan&quot; or &quot;tekin&quot;.

The suppression of the 1916 rebellion against Russian rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz later to migrate to China and Afghanistan. Most of the Kyrgyz refugees in Afghanistan settled in the Wakhan region. Until 1978, the northeastern portion of Wakhan was home to about 3–5 thousand ethnic Kyrgyz. In 1978, most Kyrgyz inhabitants fled to Pakistan in the aftermath of the Saur Revolution. They requested 5,000 visas from the United States consulate in Peshawar for resettlement in Alaska, a state of the United States which they thought might have a similar climate and temperature with the Wakhan Corridor. Their request was denied. In the meantime, the heat and the unsanitary conditions of the refugee camp were killing off the Kyrgyz refugees at an alarming rate. Turkey, which was under the military coup rule of General Kenan Evren, stepped in, and resettled the entire group in the Lake Van region of Turkey in 1982. The village of Ulupamir (or &quot;Great Pamir&quot; in Kyrgyz) in Erciş in Van Province was given to these, where more than 5,000 of them still reside today. The documentary film &quot;37 Uses for a Dead Sheep – the Story of the Pamir Kirghiz&quot; was based on the life of these Kyrgyz in their new home. Some Kyrgyz returned to Wakhan in October 1979, following the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. They are found around the Little Pamir.

=== China ===


The Kyrgyz form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. There are more than 145,000 Kyrgyz in China. They are known in Mandarin Chinese as &quot;Kē&#x27;ěrkèzī zú&quot; ().

In the 19th century, Russian settlers on traditional Kirghiz land drove a lot of the Kirghiz over the border to China, causing their population to increase in China. Compared to Russian controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz on the Chinese controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war, that China would defeat Russia.

The Kirghiz of Xinjiang revolted in the 1932 Kirghiz rebellion, and also participated in the Battle of Kashgar (1933) and again in 1934.

They are found mainly in the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture in the southwestern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with a smaller remainder found in the neighboring Wushi (Uqturpan), Aksu, Shache (Yarkand), Yingisar, Taxkorgan and Pishan (Guma), and in Tekes, Zhaosu (Monggolkure), Emin (Dorbiljin), Bole (Bortala), Jinghev (Jing) and Gongliu County in northern Xinjiang. In Akto County, the Akto Turkmen, a former Kyrgyz tribe, now speaks Uyghur.

A peculiar group, also included under the &quot;Kyrgyz nationality&quot; by the PRC official classification, are the so-called &quot;Fuyu Kyrgyz&quot;. It is a group of several hundred Yenisei Kirghiz (Khakas people) people whose forefathers were relocated from the Yenisei river region to Dzungaria by the Dzungar Khanate in the 17th century, and upon defeat of the Dzungars by the Qing dynasty, they were relocated from Dzungaria to Manchuria in the 18th century, and who now live in Wujiazi Village in Fuyu County, Heilongjiang Province. Their language (the Fuyü Gïrgïs dialect) is related to the Khakas language.

Certain segments of the Kyrgyz in China are followers of Tibetan Buddhism.

=== Pakistan===

Kyrgyz are the only Turkic people native to Pakistan. The Kyrgyz in Pakistan live mostly in the north, primarily Chitral, where Kyrgyz is the only Turkic language spoken in Pakistan. There are only a few thousand left, and many have assimilated with Pashtun or the Kho. They used to dominate the region of Gilgit-Baltistan. There are also Afghan refugees of Kyrgyz origin in Pakistan. Some also come from Kyrgyzstan from the Soviet-Afghan War where some defected and settled in Pakistan. There are also Kyrgyz nationals who work in Pakistan.

=== United States ===
The Kyrgyz American Foundation (KAF) is a US registered non-profit organization with the mission to strengthen civil, humanitarian, cultural and business ties between Kyrgyzstan and the United States by advancing intercultural awareness and cooperation. While preserving the multicultural heritage of Kyrgyzstan, KAF strives to cultivate a strong sense of identity for Kyrgyz Americans living in the US through cultural and educational initiatives.

Kyrgyz-Washington Sister Region Organization was established in 2019. The organization is governed by a board of directors consisting of business, government, and community leaders, as well as ordinary citizens, in Wenatchee, Washington. The mission of the Kyrgyz-Washington Sister Region Organization is to foster cross-cultural understanding and professional development between Kyrgyzstan and Washington State. Our mission is carried out through exchanges of delegations between the two regions and by undertaking professional analysis and advances in Kyrgyzstan and Washington State in the areas of agricultural development, outdoor recreational tourism, and water resource management.

<text>David Glasgow Farragut (; also spelled Glascoe; July 5, 1801 – August 14, 1870) was a flag officer of the United States Navy during the American Civil War. He was the first rear admiral, vice admiral, and admiral in the United States Navy. He is remembered in U.S. Navy tradition for his bold order at the Battle of Mobile Bay, usually abbreviated to &quot;Damn the torpedoes ... full speed ahead.&quot;

Born near Knoxville, Tennessee, Farragut was fostered by naval officer David Porter after the death of his mother. When he was 11 years old, Farragut served in the War of 1812 under the command of his adoptive father. He received his first command in 1823, at the age of 22, and went on to participate in anti-piracy operations in the Caribbean Sea. He then served in the Mexican–American War under the command of Matthew C. Perry, participating in the blockade of Tuxpan. After the war, he oversaw the construction of the Mare Island Navy Yard (now Mare Island Naval Shipyard), which was the first U.S. Navy base established on the Pacific Ocean.

Though Farragut resided in Norfolk, Virginia, prior to the Civil War, he was a Southern Unionist who strongly opposed Southern secession and remained loyal to the Union after the outbreak of the Civil War. Despite some doubts about Farragut&#x27;s loyalty, Farragut was assigned command of an attack on the important Confederate port city of New Orleans. After defeating the Confederates at the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, Farragut captured New Orleans in April 1862. He was promoted to rear admiral after the battle and helped extend Union control up along the Mississippi River, participating in the siege of Port Hudson. With the Union in control of the Mississippi, Farragut led a successful attack on Mobile Bay, home to the last major Confederate port on the Gulf of Mexico. Farragut was promoted to admiral following the end of the Civil War and remained on active duty until his death in 1870.

==Early life==

James Glasgow Farragut was born in 1801 to George Farragut (born Jordi Farragut Mesquida, 1755–1817), a Spanish Balearic merchant captain from the Mediterranean island of Menorca, and his wife Elizabeth (née Shine, 1765–1808), of North Carolina Scotch-Irish American descent, at Lowe&#x27;s Ferry on the Holston River in Tennessee. It was a few miles southeast of Campbell&#x27;s Station, near Knoxville.

After serving in the Spanish merchant marine, George Farragut immigrated to North America in 1776 and served as a naval officer during the American Revolutionary War. He was first with the South Carolina Navy, then with the Continental Navy. George and Elizabeth moved west to Tennessee after his service in the Revolution, where he operated Lowe&#x27;s Ferry and served as a cavalry officer in the Tennessee militia.

In 1805, George accepted a position at the U.S. port of New Orleans. He traveled there first and his family followed in a flatboat guided by hired rivermen. It was four-year-old James&#x27;s first voyage. The family was still living in New Orleans when Elizabeth died of yellow fever. George Farragut made plans to place the young children with friends and family who could better care for them.

In 1808, after his mother&#x27;s death, James agreed to live with United States Navy officer David Porter, whose father had served with George Farragut during the Revolution. In 1812, he adopted the name &quot;David&quot; in honor of his foster father, with whom he went to sea late in 1810. David Farragut grew up in a naval family, with foster brothers David Dixon Porter, a future Civil War admiral, and William D. Porter, who became a Commodore.

==Career==
Farragut&#x27;s naval career began as a midshipman when he was nine years old, and continued for 60 years until his death at the age of 69. This included service in several wars, most notably during the American Civil War, where he gained fame for winning several decisive naval battles.

===War of 1812===
Farragut&#x27;s naval career began when he was added to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s rolls with the rank of &quot;boy&quot; in the spring of 1810. Through the influence of his foster father, Farragut was warranted a midshipman in the U.S. Navy on December 17, 1810, at the age of nine. A prize master by the age of 11, Farragut fought in the War of 1812, serving under Captain Porter, his foster father. While serving aboard the frigate , Farragut participated in the capture of HMS &quot;Alert&quot; on August 13, 1812, He helped to establish America&#x27;s first naval base and colony in the Pacific, named Fort Madison, during the ill-fated Nuku Hiva Campaign in the Marquesas Islands. At the same time, the Americans battled the hostile tribes on the islands with the help of their Te I&#x27;i allies.

Farragut was 11 years old when, during the War of 1812, he was given the assignment to bring a ship captured by the &quot;Essex&quot; safely to port. He was wounded and captured while serving on the &quot;Essex&quot; during the engagement at Valparaíso Bay, Chile, against the British on March 28, 1814.

===West Indies===
In 1823, Farragut was placed in command of , which was his first command of a U.S. naval vessel. He served in the Mosquito Fleet, a fleet of ships fitted out to fight pirates in the Caribbean Sea. After learning his old captain, Commodore Porter, would be commander of the fleet, he asked for, and received, orders to serve aboard &quot;Greyhound&quot;, one of the smaller vessels, commanded by John Porter, brother of David Porter. On February 14, 1823, the fleet set sail for the West Indies where, for the next six months, they would drive the pirates off the sea, and rout them from their hiding places in among the islands. He was executive officer aboard the &quot;Experiment&quot; during its campaign in the West Indies fighting pirates. Farragut was promoted to lieutenant in 1825.

===Mexican–American War===
In 1847, Farragut, now a commander, took command of the sloop-of-war when she was recommissioned at Norfolk Navy Yard in Norfolk, Virginia. Assigned to the Home Squadron for service in the Mexican–American War, &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed Norfolk on March 29, 1847, bound for the Gulf of Mexico under Farragut&#x27;s command and upon arriving off Veracruz, Mexico, on April 26, 1847, reported to the squadron&#x27;s commander, Commodore Matthew C. Perry, for duty. On April 29, Perry ordered Farragut to sail &quot;Saratoga&quot; to the north to blockade Tuxpan, where she operated from April 30 to July 12 before Farragut returned to Veracruz. About two weeks later, Farragut began a round-trip voyage to carry dispatches to Tabasco, returning to Veracruz on August 11, 1847. On September 1, 1847, Farragut and &quot;Saratoga&quot; returned to blockade duty off Tuxpan, remaining there for two months despite a yellow fever outbreak on board. Farragut then brought the ship back to Veracruz and, after a month there, got underway for the Pensacola Navy Yard in Pensacola, Florida, where &quot;Saratoga&quot; arrived on January 6, 1848, disembarked all of her seriously sick patients at the base hospital, and replenished her stores. On January 31, 1848, Farragut took the ship out of Pensacola bound for New York City, arriving there on February 19. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was decommissioned there on February 26, 1848.

===Mare Island Navy Yard===
In 1853, Secretary of the Navy James C. Dobbin selected Commander David G. Farragut to create Mare Island Navy Yard near San Francisco in San Pablo Bay. In August 1854, Farragut was called to Washington from his post as assistant inspector of ordnance at Norfolk, Virginia. President Franklin Pierce congratulated Farragut on his naval career and the task he was to undertake. On September 16, 1854, Commander Farragut arrived to oversee the building of the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, which became the port for ship repairs on the West Coast. Captain Farragut commissioned Mare Island on July 16, 1858. Farragut returned to a hero&#x27;s welcome at Mare Island on August 11, 1859.

===Civil War service===
Although he was a Southerner by birth and lived in the South prior to the American Civil War, Farragut made it clear to all who knew him that he regarded secession as treason. Just before the war&#x27;s outbreak, Farragut moved with his Virginia-born wife to Hastings-on-Hudson, a small town just outside New York City.

He offered his services to the Union, and was initially given a seat on the Naval Retirement Board. Offered a command by his foster brother, David Dixon Porter, for a special assignment, he hesitated upon learning the target might be Norfolk. As he had friends and relatives living there, he was relieved to learn the target was changed to his former childhood home of New Orleans.

Farragut was appointed under secret instructions on February 3, 1862, to command the Gulf Blockading Squadron, sailing from Hampton Roads on the screw steamer , bearing 25 guns, which he made his flagship, accompanied by a fleet of 17 ships. He reached the mouth of the Mississippi River, near Confederate forts St. Philip and Jackson, situated opposite one another along the banks of the river, with a combined armament of more than 100 heavy guns and a complement of 700 men. Now aware of Farragut&#x27;s approach, the Confederates had amassed a fleet of 16 gunboats just outside New Orleans.

On April 18, Farragut ordered the mortar boats, under the command of Porter, to commence bombardment on the two forts, inflicting considerable damage, but not enough to compel the Confederates to surrender. After two days of heavy bombardment, Farragut ran past forts Jackson and St. Philip and the Chalmette batteries to take the city and port of New Orleans on April 29, a decisive event in the war.

Congress honored him by creating the rank of rear admiral on July 16, 1862, a rank never before used in the U.S. Navy. Before this time, the American Navy had resisted the rank of admiral, preferring the term &quot;flag officer&quot;, to distinguish the rank from the traditions of the European navies. Farragut was promoted to rear admiral along with 13 other officers – three others on the active list and ten on the retired list. Later that year, Farragut passed the batteries defending Vicksburg, Mississippi, but had no success there. A makeshift Confederate ironclad forced his flotilla of 38 ships to withdraw in July 1862.

While an aggressive commander, Farragut was not always cooperative. At the siege of Port Hudson, the plan was that Farragut&#x27;s flotilla would pass by the guns of the Confederate stronghold with the help of a diversionary land attack by the Army of the Gulf, commanded by General Nathaniel Banks, to commence at 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 1863. Farragut unilaterally decided to move the timetable up to 9:00 p.m. on March 14, and initiated his run past the guns before Union ground forces were in position. The consequently uncoordinated attack allowed the Confederates to concentrate on Farragut&#x27;s flotilla and inflict heavy damage to his warships.

Farragut&#x27;s flotilla was forced to retreat with only two ships able to pass the heavy cannon of the Confederate bastion. After surviving the gauntlet, Farragut played no further part in the battle for Port Hudson, and General Banks was left to continue the siege without the advantage of naval support. The Union Army made two major attacks on the fort; both were repulsed with heavy losses. Farragut&#x27;s flotilla was splintered, yet was able to blockade the mouth of the Red River with the two remaining warships; he could not efficiently patrol the section of the Mississippi between Port Hudson and Vicksburg. Farragut&#x27;s decision proved costly to the Union Navy and the Union Army, which suffered its highest casualty rate of the war at Port Hudson.

Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, 1863, leaving Port Hudson as the last remaining Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. General Banks accepted the surrender of the Confederate garrison at Port Hudson on July 9, ending the longest siege in U.S. military history. Control of the Mississippi River was the centerpiece of the Union strategy to win the war, and, with the surrender of Port Hudson, the Confederacy was now cut in two.

On August 5, 1864, Farragut won a great victory in the Battle of Mobile Bay. Mobile, Alabama was then the Confederacy&#x27;s last major open port on the Gulf of Mexico. The bay was heavily mined (tethered naval mines were then known as &quot;torpedoes&quot;). Farragut ordered his fleet to charge the bay. As the battle progressed, smoke blocked Farragut&#x27;s view from his position on the USS &quot;Hartford&quot;. In a detailed account of the episode, Robert M. Browning reveals that, in order to see better, Farragut climbed the ship&#x27;s rigging until he reached the futtock shrouds under the main top. Fearing for his safety, the crew lashed him to the mast and rigging.

When the monitor struck a mine and sank, the others began to pull back. &quot;What&#x27;s the trouble?&quot; he shouted through a trumpet to . &quot;Torpedoes&quot;, was the shouted reply. &quot;Damn the torpedoes.&quot;, said Farragut, &quot;Four bells, Captain Drayton, go ahead. Jouett, full speed.&quot; The bulk of the fleet succeeded in entering the bay. Farragut triumphed over the opposition of heavy batteries in Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines to defeat the squadron of Admiral Franklin Buchanan. On December 21, 1864, Lincoln promoted Farragut to vice admiral, which made him the senior ranking officer in the United States Navy.

===Post-Civil War service===
After the Civil War, Farragut was elected a companion of the first class of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States on March 18, 1866, and assigned insignia number 231. He served as the commander of the Commandery of New York from May 1866 until his death. Farragut was promoted to full admiral on July 25, 1866, becoming the first U.S. Navy officer to hold that rank. His last active service was in command of the European Squadron, from 1867 to 1868, with the screw frigate as his flagship. Farragut remained on active duty for life, an honor accorded to only seven other U.S. Navy officers after the Civil War.

==Death==

Farragut died from a heart attack at the age of 69 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while on vacation in the late summer of 1870. He had served almost sixty years in the navy. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, in The Bronx, New York City. His gravesite is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is Woodlawn Cemetery itself.

==Personal life==
After appointment and an initial cruise as acting lieutenant commanding , Farragut married Susan Caroline Marchant on September 2, 1824. After years of ill health, Susan Farragut died on December 27, 1840. Farragut was noted for his kindly treatment of his wife during her illness.

After the death of his first wife, Farragut married Virginia Dorcas Loyall, on December 26, 1843, with whom he had one surviving son, named Loyall Farragut, born October 12, 1844. Loyall Farragut graduated from West Point in 1868, and served as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army before resigning in 1872. He spent most of the remainder of his career as an executive with the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey. He was a hereditary member of the Military Society of the War of 1812 and a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Loyall died on October 1, 1916, as noted on one side of the family monument that he and his mother erected to the memory of his father in Woodlawn Cemetery.

Farragut had a brother named William A. C. Farragut. William was also in the Navy but had a far less distinguished career. He was warranted as a midshipman on January 16, 1809 – a year before David would begin his career – and was promoted to lieutenant on December 9, 1814. He remained at that rank until he was transferred to the Reserve List on December 15, 1855. He died on December 20, 1859.

Farragut was a Freemason and a Scottish Rite freemason.

==Legacy==

The area formerly known as Campbell&#x27;s Station, Tennessee, only a few miles from Admiral Farragut&#x27;s birthplace, was renamed to the town of Farragut in his honor. Farragut Square in Washington, D.C., is named in his honor. A statue of him, named &quot;Admiral David G. Farragut&quot;, is in the center of Farragut Square. Two Washington Metro stations, Farragut West and Farragut North, also share his name. There is a statue of Admiral Farragut at the South Boston Marine Park adjacent to Castle Island. There is also an outdoor sculpture of him in Madison Square Park in Manhattan, New York City, where the Farragut section of the Borough of Brooklyn, including Farragut Road, is named for him. A street in The Bronx, New York is also named for him.

The Superintendent&#x27;s residence at the United States Naval Academy was named &#x27;Farragut House&#x27; in May 2023, replacing the former name of &#x27;Buchanan House&#x27; which had been in honor of the Confederate Admiral Buchanan defeated by Farragut at during the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War. Farragut Naval Training Station, located in Northern Idaho on Lake Pend Oreille, was a World War II naval training center with over 293,000 sailors receiving basic training there. In 1966, the state of Idaho turned the land into Farragut State Park. Two separate classes of U.S. Navy destroyers have been named for Farragut: the &quot;Farragut&quot; class of 1934 and the &quot;Farragut&quot; class of 1958. Other U.S. Navy ships named &quot;Farragut&quot; include TB-11 of 1898, DD-300 of 1920, and DDG-99 of 2006.

Admiral Farragut Academy, named after Farragut, was founded in 1933 as an all-boys military boarding high school located in St. Petersburg, Florida. Today, the academy is a college preperatory private school which serves students from PreK-12th grade. The Upper School, which starts in 8th grade, is also known worldwide for its Boarding program and Navy Junior ROTC military structure. Farragut also offers other signature academic programs: Aviation, Scuba, Marine Science, Engineering, Sailing, and more.
Farragut Career Academy Chicago, IL, founded in 1894, and Farragut High School, Farragut TN, founded in 1904, are other high schools named in honor of Farragut.

Few naval officers in American history have been honored on a U.S. postage stamp, but David Farragut has been so honored more than once. The first postage stamp (at left) to honor Farragut was the 1-dollar black issue of 1903. The Navy Issue of 1937 includes (among five in a series) a 3-cent purple stamp which depicts Admirals David Farragut (left) and David Porter, with a warship under sail displayed at center. The most recent postage issue honoring Farragut was released from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on June 29, 1995.

The Tennessee State Capitol Commission and Historical Commission voted on July 22, 2021, to move a bust of Admiral Farragut, as well as busts of Nathan Bedford Forrest and Admiral Albert Gleaves, from the Tennessee Capitol to the Tennessee State Museum. The process of moving them officially began on July 23, 2021. Farragut&#x27;s likeness is featured on the southern side of the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument in Portland, Maine.

<text>John Carter of Mars is a fictional Virginian soldier who acts as the initial protagonist of the Barsoom stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. A veteran of the American Civil War, he is transported to the planet Mars, called Barsoom by its inhabitants, where he becomes a warrior battling various mythological beasts, alien armies and malevolent foes. Created in 1911, the character has appeared in novels and short stories, comic books, television shows and films, including the 2012 feature film &quot;John Carter&quot;, which marked the 100th anniversary of the character&#x27;s first appearance.

==Appearances==
John Carter was the lead character in the first novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, set on a fictionalized version of Mars known as Barsoom. Written between July and September 28, 1911, the novel was serialized as &quot;Under the Moons of Mars&quot; in the pulp magazine &quot;The All-Story&quot; from February to July 1912. It later appeared as a complete novel only after the success of Burroughs&#x27;s Tarzan series. For its October 1917 hardcover publication by A.C. McClurg &amp; Company, the novel was retitled &quot;A Princess of Mars.&quot;

Carter reappeared in subsequent volumes of the series, most prominently in the second (&quot;The Gods of Mars,&quot; 1918), the third (&quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; 1919), the eighth (&quot;Swords of Mars,&quot; 1936), the tenth (&quot;Llana of Gathol,&quot; 1948), and the eleventh and final installment (&quot;John Carter of Mars,&quot; published posthumously in 1964). John Carter is also a major secondary character in the fourth volume (&quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars,&quot; 1920), and the ninth (&quot;Synthetic Men of Mars,&quot; 1940). In September 2021, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. released &quot;John Carter Of Mars: Gods of the Forgotten&quot;, by Geary Gravel. Considered by some to be the 12th book in the Barsoom series, it is not widely accepted as such.

==Description==
Carter stands and has close-cropped black hair and steel-grey eyes. Burroughs describes him as immortal. In the opening pages of &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, it is revealed that Carter can remember no childhood, having always been a man of about thirty years old. Many generations have known him as &quot;Uncle Jack,&quot; but he always lived to see them grow old and die, while he remained young.

His character and courtesy exemplify the ideals of the Antebellum South. A Virginian, he served as a captain in the American Civil War on the side of the Confederacy. After the war, Carter and his companion Powell, who was also a captain in the Civil War, became gold prospectors. Carter and Powell struck it rich by finding gold in Arizona. While hiding from Apaches in a cave, he appears to die; leaving his inanimate body behind, he is mysteriously transported by a form of astral projection to the planet Mars, where he finds himself re-embodied in a form identical to his earthly one. Accustomed to the greater gravity of Earth, he finds himself to be much stronger and more agile than the natives of Mars.

==Character biography==

On Mars, which its natives call Barsoom, Carter encounters both formidable alien creatures resembling the beasts of ancient myth, and various humanoids. He finds his true calling in life as a warlord who strives to save the planet&#x27;s inhabitants. He wins the hand of a Martian princess, Dejah Thoris of Helium, but after several years of marriage he sacrifices himself to save Barsoom from the loss of its atmosphere. Awakening again after this second death he finds he has been miraculously transported back to Earth, into his original body. Carter then collects the wealth that resulted from his discovery of a rich vein of gold ore right before his original passage to Barsoom. Unable to return to Mars, he spends several more years in a small cottage on the Hudson River in New York, where he once more appears to die on March 4, 1886. In his first appearance, he refers to the fact that he does not actually know how old he is or when or where he was born. He further states that he has been a fighting man for a very long time, by implication far longer than a single human lifetime.

Again, Carter&#x27;s apparent demise is not a true death; rather, he is restored to Barsoom, where after more adventures he rises to the position of Warlord of Mars, having played an instrumental role in creating alliances among many of the sentient races of Barsoom. He returns to Earth on a number of occasions afterward to relate his adventures to his nephew (&quot;Burroughs&quot;), revealing that he has mastered the process of astral travel between the two worlds. During his adventures on Mars his earthly body reposes in a special tomb that can only be opened from the inside.

John Carter and Dejah Thoris become the parents of a son, Carthoris, and daughter, Tara. Carthoris plays a secondary role in &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot;, and is the protagonist of &quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot;. Tara is the heroine of &quot;The Chessmen of Mars&quot; (1922), and the mother of Carter&#x27;s granddaughter Llana, heroine of &quot;Llana of Gathol&quot;.

Only one other Earthman, Ulysses Paxton is able to travel to Mars via the method Carter used.

A complete list of characters is given at the end of &quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot;.

==In other media==

===Comics===

John Carter has appeared many times in short-lived comic strips and comic books, as well as in various Big Little Books of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1932, Burroughs tried to convince United Feature Syndicate, the distributors of the &quot;Tarzan&quot; comic strip, to also make an adaptation of &quot;John Carter&quot;; however the syndicate rejected the idea. In 1933, King Features Syndicate, wanting a science fiction strip to compete with the popular &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, discussed a &quot;John Carter&quot; adaptation with Burroughs. Burroughs and the illustrator J. Allen St. John, expressed an interest in doing such a strip for King Features. However, Burroughs and King Features were unable to reach an agreement, and the syndicate decided to use an original strip—&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; by Alex Raymond—instead.

In 1941, United Feature agreed to the creation of a &quot;John Carter&quot; strip, hoping it would become as successful as &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. The most notable John Carter comic adaptation to appear in Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; was written and illustrated by Burroughs&#x27;s son John Coleman Burroughs. This strip debuted on Sunday, December 7, 1941—the very day of the infamous Pearl Harbor Attack. This strip lasted only one year and four months, ending on April 18, 1943. Coleman Burroughs&#x27;s strip was reprinted in book form by House of Greystoke in 1970.

Dell Comics released three issues of &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; under its &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; anthology title. The issue numbers are 375, 437, and 488 and were released in 1952–1953. These were reprinted by &quot;Gold Key Comics&quot; (with different covers) in 1964.

Carter has appeared in various subsequent graphic adaptations of the Martian stories, notably the &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; feature that ran in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Weird Worlds&quot; comics from 1972 to 1973, and in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;John Carter, Warlord of Mars&quot; from 1977 to 1979.

He also appeared, along with Tarzan, in a 1994–1995 storyline of the &quot;Tarzan&quot; Sunday comic strip, and in &quot;Tarzan/John Carter: Warlords of Mars&quot;, a 1996 four-issue miniseries from Dark Horse Comics.

In 2010, Dynamite Entertainment published an ongoing series titled &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;, written by Arvid Nelson. In 2011, &quot;Warlord of Mars: Dejah Thoris&quot; #1 debuted, also written by Nelson. He has since appearance in multiple Dejah Thoris comics and even had his own comics, and will have a new comic series.

SelfMadeHero are also adapting &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; into a graphic novel, adapted by Ian Edginton with art by INJ Culbard.

Carter&#x27;s physical appearances in the comics varied greatly from decade to decade. He was a frequent character in sketches and paintings by Frank Frazetta.

In 2023, Glénat Éditions published &quot;La Princesse de Mars - Tome 1&quot;, a graphic novel adaptation by Jean-David Morvan (script) and Francesco Biagini (art).

===Other novels and television programs===
Carter is also found in other novels and stories. He makes two appearances in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;. The first is in the story Allan and the Sundered Veil, which appears in the end of volume one. In this story, Moore claims that H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Randolph Carter is a descendant of John Carter. Carter also appears in the beginning of volume two, helping the Barsoomians fight against the Martians from &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. The same scenario also appeared in the Burroughs entry in the &quot;War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches&quot; anthology. In addition, one of the protagonists of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; is Captain Zebediah John Carter, whose lover becomes his wife Dejah Thoris &quot;Deety&quot; Burroughs Carter. The similarity in names is noted within the novel, since all of the major characters are fans of vintage science fiction. In &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Children&quot;, by Charles Stross, Barsoom and Carter City are names of settlements on Mars. In Philip José Farmer&#x27;s &quot;World of Tiers&quot; novels the moon circling the World of Tiers is modelled after Barsoom, from Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; novels, an homage which Farmer openly admits in the third book of the series. In Dan Simmon&#x27;s Hyperion, when Fedmahn Kassad turned eighteen, he was offered the choice of serving at a Martian polar work camp or enlisting with the John Carter Brigade, a volunteer task force seeking to aid FORCE against the Glennon-Height Rebellion. In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s Southern Victory series final novel, &quot;Settling Accounts: In at the Death&quot;, a character named John Carter of the &quot;Tarkas&quot; estate (a reference to Tars Tarkas, one of the green men of Mars), appears before a U.S. general after having protected African-Americans from the genocide taking place elsewhere.

The &quot;object compass&quot; in E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith&#x27;s Skylark series is very similar to the Barsoomian &quot;destination compass&quot; mentioned in the Mars series. Moreover, the Jandar of Callisto series by Lin Carter and the Dray Prescot series by Alan Burt Akers owe a great deal to Burroughs&#x27;s Mars stories. In Stephen King&#x27;s novella &quot;The Long Walk&quot;, a sarcastic reference is made by a Long-Walker - when asked his name, the character replies &quot;My name is John Carter, my home is Barsoom, Mars&quot;. In Allan Howard&#x27;s short story &quot;It&#x27;s a Small Solar System&quot;, originally published in &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot; (September 1957), the first explorers to land on Mars are welcomed by a man with a Southern accent: &quot;Welcome to Barsoom! My name is John Carter.&quot; But as no one reads for pleasure on Earth anymore, the significance of this encounter is totally lost on the newcomers, and so ends the story.

Carter has also been referenced in television shows. In &quot;Zone of the Enders: Dolores, i&quot;, the protagonist, James Links, is always called &quot;John Carter&quot; by the WIRED officer, Baan Dorfloun. James Links is an Earth-born human who fell in love and had children with a Mars-born woman. In Episode 15 of the anime series &quot;To Love-Ru&quot;, a prince named Carter, from the planet Burroughs, arrives on Earth to conduct a hunt in a hidden alien game preserve in Guyana. In the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Spider in the Web&quot;, John Carter is mentioned as the pilot of the first colony ship to Mars. In &quot;Secret Origins&quot;, the pilot episode of the cartoon TV series &quot;Justice League&quot;, the first US astronaut on Mars is named J. Allen Carter. Carter sets up Earth for invasion by the Mars-based &quot;Imperium&quot;, which had wiped out the native Martian population, except for sole survivor J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz, aka Martian Manhunter.

In January 2020, Altus Press released &quot;Tarzan: Conqueror of Mars&quot; by Will Murray, an authorized Tarzan novel in which Tarzan finds himself marooned on Barsoom and seeks John Carter&#x27;s help to return home.

===Influence on later works===
John Carter of Mars was a major influence on other science fiction/fantasy tales and characters through the 20th century, including Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Superman, Adam Strange, &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;Warp!&quot;, Den, and &quot;Star Wars&quot; to name just a few.

The movie &quot;Avatar&quot; was inspired by John Carter of Mars. According to &quot;Avatar&quot; creator, James Cameron, &quot;With &quot;Avatar&quot;, I thought, Forget all these chick flicks and do a classic guys&#x27; adventure movie, something in the Edgar Rice Burroughs mold, like John Carter of Mars – a soldier goes to Mars.&quot;

In the first chapters of Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot; (1967), the character Peter Sanford – aged 16 at the outset of the plot – indulges in vivid and detailed fantasies of being John Carter, and adds explicit erotic scenes not appearing in the original Burroughs books.

In &quot;The Number Of The Beast&quot;, by Robert Heinlein, two of the main characters are inspired by the John Carter series. One is actually a reserve captain from Virginia named Zebadiah John Carter and his (soon to be) bride is named Deejah Thoris (Deety) Burroughs. They use technology to skip to various worlds, and end up meeting Lazarus Long.

===Films===
Bob Clampett, the animator, wanted to produce a full-length cartoon of John Carter in the 1930s and talked with Burroughs about it. Several seconds of animation appear in the supplemental material of the home-video version of the Disney film.

John Carter was played by Antonio Sabàto Jr. in the 2009 film &quot;Princess of Mars&quot;, which also starred Traci Lords as Princess Dejah Thoris.

In the 2012 Disney film adaptation of the series, &quot;John Carter&quot;, Carter is played by Taylor Kitsch, with the role of Dejah Thoris played by Lynn Collins.

===Games===
The &quot;John Carter, Warlord of Mars&quot; role-playing game was published by Heritage Models in 1978. In 2015, British company Modiphius Entertainment acquired a John Carter license, announcing plans to put out a new John Carter role-playing game, miniatures and a board game in 2016.

<doc id="102739" wikidata="Q188205" url="?curid=102739" title="George Armstrong Custer">
<text>George Armstrong Custer (December 5, 1839 – June 25, 1876) was a United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the American Indian Wars.

Custer graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, last in his graduating class of 1861, although he finished 34th out of a starting class of 108 candidates. Nonetheless, Custer achieved a higher military rank than any other U.S. Army officer in his class. Following graduation, he worked closely with future Union Army Generals George B. McClellan and Alfred Pleasonton, both of whom recognized his abilities as a cavalry leader. He was promoted in the early American Civil War (1861–1865), to brevet brigadier general of volunteers when only aged 23. Only a few days afterwards, he fought at the pivotal Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania in early July 1863, where he commanded the Michigan Brigade. Despite being outnumbered, the new General Custer defeated Confederate States Army cavalry of General J. E. B. Stuart&#x27;s attack at East Cavalry Field on the crucial third day of the Gettysburg clash.

In 1864, Custer served in the Overland Campaign and with Union cavalry commander General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s army in the Shenandoah Valley campaigns later that summer, defeating Confederate General Jubal Early at Cedar Creek. In the last year of the war of 1865, he destroyed or captured the remainder of Early&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Waynesboro in Western Virginia. Custer&#x27;s division blocked the Southern Army of Northern Virginia&#x27;s final retreat from their fallen capital city of Richmond in early April 1865 and received the first flag of truce from the exhausted Confederates. He was present at the Army of Northern Virginia commanding General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender ceremony at the McLean House to Union Army General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. After the war, Custer was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the standing Regular Army and sent west to fight in the ongoing Indian Wars, mainly against the Lakota / Sioux and other Great Plains native peoples. On June 25, 1876, while leading the Army&#x27;s 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the southeastern Montana Territory against a coalition of Western Native American tribes, he was killed along with every soldier of the five companies he led of his regiment. This event became known as &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;.

Custer&#x27;s dramatic end was as controversial as the rest of his life and career, and the reaction to his life remains divided, even 150 years later. His mythologized status in American history was partly established through the energetic lobbying of his adoring wife Elizabeth Bacon &quot;Libbie&quot; Custer (1842–1933), throughout her long widowhood which spanned six decades longer into the mid-20th century.

==Family and ancestry==
Custer&#x27;s paternal ancestors, Paulus and Gertrude Küster, came to the North American English colonies around 1693 from the Rhineland in Germany, probably among thousands of Palatines whose passage was arranged by the English government to gain settlers in New York and Pennsylvania.

Custer&#x27;s maternal ancestors were of English and Ulster Scots descent, having ancestries from England and Northern Ireland.

According to family letters, Custer was named after George Armstrong, a minister, in his devout mother&#x27;s hope that her son might join the clergy.

==Birth, siblings, and childhood==
Custer was born in New Rumley, Ohio, to Emanuel Henry Custer (1806–1892), a farmer and blacksmith, and his second wife, Marie Ward Kirkpatrick (1807–1882), who was of English and Scots-Irish descent. He had two younger brothers, Thomas and Boston. His other full siblings were the family&#x27;s youngest child, Margaret Custer, and Nevin Custer, who suffered from asthma and rheumatism. Custer also had three older half-siblings. Custer and his brothers acquired a life-long love of practical jokes, which they played out among the close family members.

Emanuel Custer was an outspoken Jacksonian Democrat who taught his children politics and toughness at an early age. In a February 3, 1887, letter to his son&#x27;s widow Libby, Emanuel related an incident from when George Custer (known as Autie) was about four years old: 
&quot;He had to have a tooth drawn, and he was very much afraid of blood. When I took him to the doctor to have the tooth pulled, it was in the night and I told him if it bled well it would get well right away, and he must be a good soldier. When he got to the doctor he took his seat, and the pulling began. The forceps slipped off and he had to make a second trial. He pulled it out, and Autie never even scrunched. Going home, I led him by the arm. He jumped and skipped, and said &#x27;Father you and me can whip all the Whigs in Michigan.&#x27; I thought that was saying a good deal but I did not contradict him.&quot;

==Education==

In order to attend school, Custer lived with an older half-sister and her husband in Monroe, Michigan. Before entering the United States Military Academy, Custer attended the McNeely Normal School, later known as Hopedale Normal College, in Hopedale, Ohio. The school was known for training teachers for elementary schools. While attending Hopedale, Custer and classmate William Enos Emery were known to have carried coal to help pay for their room and board. After graduating from McNeely Normal School in 1856, Custer taught school in Cadiz, Ohio. His first sweetheart was Mary Jane Holland.

Custer entered West Point as a cadet on July 1, 1857, as a member of the class of 1862. His class numbered seventy-nine cadets embarking on a five-year course of study. With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the course was shortened to four years, and Custer and his class graduated on June 24, 1861. He was 34th in a class of 34 graduates: 23 classmates had dropped out for academic reasons while 22 classmates had already resigned to join the Confederacy.

Throughout his life, Custer tested boundaries and rules. In his four years at West Point, he amassed a record total of 726 demerits, one of the worst conduct records in the history of the academy. The local minister remembered Custer as &quot;the instigator of devilish plots both during the service and in Sunday school. On the surface he appeared attentive and respectful, but underneath the mind boiled with disruptive ideas.&quot; A fellow cadet recalled Custer as declaring there were only two places in a class, the head and the foot, and since he had no desire to be the head, he aspired to be the foot. A roommate noted, &quot;It was alright with George Custer, whether he knew his lesson or not; he simply did not allow it to trouble him.&quot;

==Civil War==
===McClellan and Pleasonton===

Like the other graduates, Custer was commissioned a second lieutenant; he was also assigned to the 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiment and tasked with drilling volunteers in Washington, D.C. On July 21, 1861, he was with his regiment at the First Battle of Bull Run during the Manassas Campaign where Army commander Winfield Scott detailed him to carry messages to Major General Irvin McDowell. After the battle, he continued participating in the defense of Washington D.C. until October 1861, when he became ill. He was absent from his unit until February 1862. In March, he participated with the 2nd Cavalry in the Peninsula Campaign in Virginia until April 4.

On April 5, Custer served in the 5th Cavalry Regiment which participated in the Siege of Yorktown from April 5 to May 4 and was aide to Major General George B. McClellan. McClellan was in command of the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign. On May 24, 1862, during pursuit of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston up the Peninsula, General McClellan and his staff were reconnoitering a potential crossing point on the Chickahominy River, they stopped, and Custer overheard General John G. Barnard mutter, &quot;I wish I knew how deep it is.&quot; Custer dashed forward on his horse out to the middle of the river, turned to the astonished officers, and shouted triumphantly, &quot;McClellan, that&#x27;s how deep it is, General!&quot;

Custer was assigned to lead an attack with four companies of the 4th Michigan Infantry across the Chickahominy River above New Bridge. The attack was successful, resulting in the capture of 50 Confederate soldiers and the seizing of the first Confederate battle flag of the war. McClellan termed it a &quot;very gallant affair&quot; and congratulated Custer personally. In his role as aide-de-camp to McClellan, he began his life-long pursuit of publicity. He was promoted to the rank of captain on June 5, 1862. On July 17, he was demoted to the rank of first lieutenant. He participated in the Maryland Campaign in September to October, the Battle of South Mountain on September 14, the Battle of Antietam on September 17, and the March to Warrenton, Virginia, in October.

On June 9, 1863, he became aide to Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Pleasonton, who was commanding the Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac. Recalling his service under Pleasonton, he was quoted as saying that &quot;I do not believe a father could love his son more than General Pleasonton loves me.&quot; Pleasonton&#x27;s first assignment was to locate the army of Robert E. Lee, moving north through the Shenandoah Valley in the beginning of what was to become the Gettysburg Campaign.

===Brigade command===
Pleasonton was promoted on June 22, 1863, to major general of U.S. Volunteers. On June 29, after consulting with the new commander of the Army of the Potomac, George Meade, Pleasanton began replacing political generals with &quot;commanders who were prepared to fight, to personally lead mounted attacks&quot;. He found just the kind of aggressive fighters he wanted in three of his aides: Wesley Merritt, Elon J. Farnsworth (both of whom had command experience), and Custer. All received immediate promotions, Custer to brigadier general of volunteers, commanding the Michigan Cavalry Brigade (&quot;Wolverines&quot;), part of the division of Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick. Despite having no direct command experience, he became one of the youngest generals in the Union Army at the age of 23. He immediately shaped his brigade to reflect his aggressive character. 
Now a general officer, he had greater latitude in choosing his uniform. Though often criticized as being gaudy, it was more than personal vanity. Historian Tom Carhart observed that &quot;A showy uniform for Custer was one of command presence on the battlefield: he wanted to be readily distinguishable at first glance from all other soldiers. He intended to lead from the front, and to him it was a crucial issue of unit morale that his men be able to look up in the middle of a charge, or at any other time on the battlefield, and instantly see him leading the way into danger.&quot;

===Hanover and Abbottstown===
On June 30, 1863, Custer and the First and Seventh Michigan Cavalry had just passed through Hanover, Pennsylvania, while the Fifth and Sixth Michigan Cavalry followed about seven miles behind. Hearing gunfire, he turned and started off to the sound of the guns. A courier reported that Farnsworth&#x27;s Brigade had been attacked by rebel cavalry from side streets in the town. Reassembling his command, he received orders from Kilpatrick to engage the enemy northeast of town near the railway station. Custer deployed his troops and began to advance. After a brief firefight, the rebels withdrew to the northeast. This seemed odd, since it was assumed that Lee and his army were somewhere to the west. Though seemingly of little consequence, this skirmish further delayed Stuart from joining Lee. As Captain James H. Kidd, commander of F troop, Sixth Michigan Cavalry, later wrote: &quot;Under [Custer&#x27;s] skillful hand the four regiments were soon welded into a cohesive unit...&quot;

Next morning, July 1, they passed through Abbottstown, Pennsylvania, still searching for Stuart&#x27;s cavalry. Late in the morning they heard sounds of gunfire from the direction of Gettysburg. That night at Heidlersburg, Pennsylvania, they learned that General John Buford&#x27;s cavalry had found Lee&#x27;s army at Gettysburg. The next morning, July 2, orders came for Custer to hurry north to disrupt General Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s communications and relieve the pressure on the Union forces. By midafternoon, as they approached Hunterstown, Pennsylvania, they encountered Stuart&#x27;s cavalry. Custer rode ahead alone to investigate and found that the rebels were unaware of the arrival of his troops.

Returning to his men, he carefully positioned them along both sides of the road where they would be hidden from the rebels. Further along the road, behind a low rise, he positioned the First and Fifth Michigan Cavalry and his artillery, under the command of Lieutenant Alexander Cummings McWhorter Pennington Jr. To bait his trap, he gathered A Troop, Sixth Michigan Cavalry, and called out, &quot;Come on boys, I&#x27;ll lead you this time!&quot; and galloped directly at the unsuspecting rebels. As he had expected, the rebels, &quot;more than two hundred horsemen, came racing down the country road&quot; after Custer and his men.

He lost half of his men in the deadly rebel fire and his horse went down, leaving him on foot. He was rescued by Private Norvell Francis Churchill of the 1st Michigan Cavalry, who galloped up, shot Custer&#x27;s nearest assailant, and pulled Custer up behind him. Custer and his remaining men reached safety, while the pursuing rebels were cut down by slashing rifle fire, then canister from six cannons. The rebels broke off their attack, and both sides withdrew.

Spending most of the night in the saddle, Custer&#x27;s brigade arrived at Two Taverns, Pennsylvania, roughly five miles southeast of Gettysburg around 3:00 a.m. on July 3. There he was joined by Farnsworth&#x27;s brigade. By daybreak they received orders to protect Meade&#x27;s flanks. At this point, he was about to experience perhaps his finest hours during the war.

===Gettysburg===

Lee&#x27;s battle plan, shared with less than a handful of subordinates, was to defeat Meade through a combined assault using all of his resources. General James Longstreet would attack Cemetery Hill from the west, Stuart would attack Culp&#x27;s Hill from the southeast, and Ewell would attack Culp&#x27;s Hill from the north. Once the Union forces holding Culp&#x27;s Hill had collapsed, the rebels would &quot;roll up&quot; the remaining Union defenses on Cemetery Ridge. To accomplish this, he sent Stuart with six thousand cavalrymen and mounted infantry on a long flanking maneuver.

By mid-morning on July 3, Custer had arrived at the intersection of Old Dutch Road and Hanover Road, two miles east of Gettysburg. He was later joined by Brigadier General David McMurtrie Gregg, who had him deploy his men at the northeast corner. Custer then sent out scouts to investigate nearby wooded areas. Meanwhile, Gregg had positioned Colonel John Baillie McIntosh&#x27;s brigade near the intersection and sent the rest of his command to do picket duty two miles to the southwest. After additional deployments, 2,400 cavalry under McIntosh and 1,200 under Custer remained together with Colonel Alexander Cummings McWhorter Pennington Jr.&#x27;s and Captain Alanson Merwin Randol&#x27;s artillery, who had a total of ten three-inch guns.

About noon, Custer&#x27;s men heard cannon fire, Stuart&#x27;s signal to Lee that he was in position and had not been detected. About the same time, Gregg received a message warning that a large body of rebel cavalry had moved out on the York Pike and might be trying to get around the Union right. A second message from Pleasonton ordered Gregg to send Custer to cover the Union far left. Since Gregg had already sent most of his force off to do other duties, it was clear to both Gregg and Custer that Custer must remain. They had about 2,700 men facing 6,000 Confederates.

Soon afterward, fighting broke out between the skirmish lines. Stuart ordered an attack by his mounted infantry under General Albert G. Jenkins, but the Union line held, with men from the First Michigan cavalry, the First New Jersey Cavalry, and the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry. Stuart ordered Jackson&#x27;s four gun battery into action; Custer ordered Pennington to answer. After a brief exchange in which two of Jackson&#x27;s guns were destroyed, there was a lull in the action.

About one o&#x27;clock, the massive Confederate artillery barrage began in support of the upcoming assault on Cemetery Ridge. Jenkins&#x27;s men renewed the attack, but soon ran out of ammunition and fell back. Resupplied, they again pressed the attack. Outnumbered, the Union cavalry fell back, firing as they went. Custer sent most of his Fifth Michigan cavalry ahead on foot, forcing Jenkins&#x27;s men to fall back. Jenkins&#x27;s men were reinforced by about 150 sharpshooters from General Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s brigade, and shortly Stuart ordered a mounted charge by the Ninth Virginia Cavalry and the Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry. Now it was Custer&#x27;s men who were running out of ammunition. The Fifth Michigan was forced back and the battle was reduced to vicious, hand-to-hand combat.

Seeing this, Custer mounted a counterattack. Riding ahead of the fewer than 400 new troopers of the Seventh Michigan Cavalry, he shouted, &quot;Come on, you Wolverines!&quot; As he swept forward, he formed a line of squadrons five ranks deep – five rows of eighty horsemen side by side – chasing the retreating rebels until their charge was stopped by a wood rail fence. The horses and men became jammed into a solid mass and were soon attacked on their left flank by the dismounted Ninth and Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry and on the right flank by the mounted First Virginia Cavalry. Custer extricated his men and raced south to the protection of Pennington&#x27;s artillery near Hanover Road. The pursuing Confederates were cut down by canister, then driven back by the remounted Fifth Michigan Cavalry. Both forces withdrew to a safe distance to regroup.

It was then about three o&#x27;clock. The artillery barrage to the west had suddenly stopped. Union soldiers were surprised to see Stuart&#x27;s entire force about a half mile away coming toward them, not in line of battle, but &quot;formed in close column of squadrons... A grander spectacle than their advance has rarely been beheld&quot;. Stuart recognized he now had little time to reach and attack the Union rear along Cemetery Ridge; he must make one last effort to break through the Union cavalry.

Stuart passed by McIntosh&#x27;s cavalry – the First New Jersey, Third Pennsylvania, and Company A of Purnell&#x27;s Legion, which had been posted about halfway down the field – with relative ease. As Stuart approached, the Union troops were ordered back into the woods without slowing down Stuart&#x27;s column, which was &quot;advancing as if in review, with sabers drawn and glistening like silver in the bright sunlight...&quot;

Stuart&#x27;s last obstacle was Custer and his 400 veteran troopers of the First Michigan Cavalry directly in the Confederate cavalry&#x27;s path. Outnumbered but undaunted, Custer rode to the head of the regiment, &quot;drew his saber, threw off his hat so they could see his long yellow hair&quot; and shouted... &quot;Come on, you Wolverines!&quot; Custer formed his men in line of battle and charged. &quot;So sudden was the collision that many of the horses were turned end over end and crushed their riders beneath them...&quot;

As the Confederate advance stopped, their right flank was struck by troopers of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Michigan. McIntosh was able to gather some of his men from the First New Jersey and Third Pennsylvania and charged the rebel left flank. &quot;Seeing that the situation was becoming critical, I [Captain Miller] turned to [Lieutenant Brooke-Rawle] and said: &#x27;I have been ordered to hold this position, but, if you will back me up in case I am court-martialed for disobedience, I will order a charge.&#x27;&quot; The rebel column disintegrated, and individual troopers fought with saber and pistol.

Within twenty minutes the combatants heard the sound of the Union artillery opening up on Pickett&#x27;s men. Stuart knew that whatever chance he had of joining the Confederate assault was gone. He withdrew his men to Cress Ridge. 
Custer&#x27;s brigade lost 257 men at Gettysburg; the highest loss of any Union cavalry brigade. &quot;I challenge the annals of warfare to produce a more brilliant or successful charge of cavalry&quot;, Custer wrote in his report. &quot;For Gallant And Meritorious Services&quot;, he was awarded a Regular Army brevet promotion to major.

===Shenandoah Valley and Appomattox Court House===
General Custer also participated in Sheridan&#x27;s campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. In this campaign, the civilian population was specifically targeted in what is known as &quot;the Burning&quot;.

In 1864, with the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac reorganized under the command of Major General Philip Sheridan, Custer (now commanding the 3rd Division) led his &quot;Wolverines&quot; to the Shenandoah Valley where by the year&#x27;s end they defeated the army of Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early in the Valley Campaigns of 1864. During May and June, Sheridan and Custer (Captain, 5th Cavalry, May 8 and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel, May 11) took part in cavalry actions supporting the Overland Campaign, including the Battle of the Wilderness (after which Custer ascended to division command), and the Battle of Yellow Tavern (where J.E.B. Stuart was mortally wounded).

In the largest all-cavalry engagement of the war, the Battle of Trevilian Station, in which Sheridan sought to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad and the Confederates&#x27; western resupply route, Custer captured Hampton&#x27;s divisional train, but was then cut off and suffered heavy losses (including having his division&#x27;s trains overrun and his personal baggage captured by the enemy) before being relieved. When Lieutenant General Early was ordered to move down the Shenandoah Valley and threaten Washington, D.C., Custer&#x27;s division was again dispatched under Sheridan. In the Valley Campaigns of 1864, they pursued the Confederates at the Third Battle of Winchester and effectively destroyed Early&#x27;s army during Sheridan&#x27;s counterattack at Cedar Creek.

Sheridan and Custer, having defeated Early, returned to the main Union Army lines at the Siege of Petersburg, where they spent the winter. In April 1865, the Confederate lines finally broke and Robert E. Lee began his retreat to Appomattox Court House, pursued by the Union cavalry. Custer distinguished himself by his actions at Waynesboro, Dinwiddie Court House, and Five Forks. His division blocked Lee&#x27;s retreat on its final day and received the first flag of truce from the Confederate force.

After a truce was arranged, Custer was escorted through the lines to meet Longstreet, who described Custer as having flaxen locks flowing over his shoulders, and Custer said &quot;in the name of General Sheridan I demand the unconditional surrender of this army.&quot; Longstreet replied that he was not in command of the army, but if he was, he would not deal with messages from Sheridan. Custer responded it would be a pity to have more blood upon the field, to which Longstreet suggested the truce be respected, and then added &quot;General Lee has gone to meet General Grant, and it is for them to determine the future of the armies.&quot;

Custer was present at the surrender at Appomattox Court House and the table upon which the surrender was signed was presented to him as a gift for his wife by Sheridan, who included a note praising Custer&#x27;s gallantry. She treasured the gift of the historic table, which is now in the Smithsonian Institution. On April 15, 1865, Custer was promoted to major general in the U.S. Volunteers, making him the youngest major general in the Union Army at age 25.

On April 25, after the war officially ended, Custer had his men search for and illegally seize a large, prize racehorse named &quot;Don Juan&quot; near Clarksville, Virginia, worth an estimated $10,000 (several hundred thousand today), along with his written pedigree. Custer rode Don Juan in the grand review victory parade in Washington, D.C., on May 23, creating a sensation when the scared thoroughbred bolted. The owner, Richard Gaines, wrote to General Grant, who ordered Custer to return the horse to Gaines, but he did not. Instead, he hid the horse and won a race with it the next year, before the horse suddenly died.

==Reconstruction duties in Texas==
On June 3, 1865, at Sheridan&#x27;s behest, Major General Custer accepted command of the 2nd Division of Cavalry, Military Division of the Southwest, to march from Alexandria, Louisiana, to Hempstead, Texas, as part of the Union occupation forces. Custer arrived at Alexandria on June 27 and began assembling his units, which took more than a month to gather and remount. On July 17, he assumed command of the Cavalry Division of the Military Division of the Gulf (on August 5, officially named the 2nd Division of Cavalry of the Military Division of the Gulf), and accompanied by his wife, he led the division (five regiments of veteran Western Theater cavalrymen) to Texas on an arduous 18-day march in August. On October 27, the division departed to Austin. On October 29, Custer moved the division from Hempstead to Austin, arriving on November 4. Major General Custer became Chief of Cavalry of the Department of Texas, from November 13 to February 1, 1866, succeeding Major General Wesley Merritt.

During his entire period of command of the division, Custer encountered considerable friction and near mutiny from the volunteer cavalry regiments who had campaigned along the Gulf coast. They desired to be mustered out of Federal service rather than continue campaigning. They resented the imposition of discipline (particularly from an Eastern Theater general) and considered Custer nothing more than a vain dandy.

Custer&#x27;s division was mustered out beginning in November 1865, replaced by the regulars of the U.S. 6th Cavalry Regiment. Although their occupation of Austin had apparently been pleasant, many veterans harbored deep resentments against Custer, particularly those in the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry, because of his attempts to maintain discipline. Upon its mustering out, several members planned to ambush Custer, but he was warned the night before and the attempt thwarted.

==Post-war options==



On February 1, 1866, Major General Custer mustered out of the U.S. volunteer service and took an extended leave of absence until September 24. During this time he explored several options in New York City, where he considered careers in railroads and mining. Offered a position (and $10,000 in gold) as adjutant general of the army of Benito Juárez of Mexico, who was then in a struggle with the Mexican Emperor Maximilian I (a satellite ruler of French Emperor Napoleon III), Custer applied for a one-year leave of absence from the U.S. Army, which was endorsed by Grant and Secretary Stanton. However, Sheridan and Mrs. Custer disapproved, and after his request for leave was opposed by U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, who was against having an American officer commanding foreign troops, Custer refused the alternative of resignation from the Army to take the lucrative post.

Following the death of his father-in-law in May 1866, Custer returned to Monroe, Michigan, where he considered running for Congress. He took part in public discussion over the treatment of the American South in the aftermath of the Civil War, advocating a policy of moderation. He was named head of the Soldiers and Sailors Union, regarded as a response to the hyper-partisan Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). Formed in 1866, it was led by Republican activist John Alexander Logan.

In September 1866, Custer accompanied President Andrew Johnson on a journey by train known as the &quot;Swing Around the Circle&quot; to build up public support for Johnson&#x27;s policies towards the South. Custer denied a charge by the newspapers that Johnson had promised him a colonel&#x27;s commission in return for his support, but Custer had written to Johnson some weeks before seeking such a commission. Custer and his wife stayed with the president during most of the trip. At one point, Custer confronted a small group of Ohio men who repeatedly jeered Johnson, saying to them: &quot;I was born two miles and a half from here, but I am ashamed of you.&quot;

==Indian Wars==

On July 28, 1866, Custer was appointed lieutenant colonel of the newly created 7th Cavalry Regiment, which was headquartered at Fort Riley, Kansas. He served on frontier duty at Fort Riley from October 18 to March 26, and scouted in Kansas and Colorado until July 28, 1867. He took part in Major General Winfield Scott Hancock&#x27;s expedition against the Cheyenne. On June 26, Lt. Lyman Kidder&#x27;s party, made up of ten troopers and one scout, were massacred while en route to Fort Wallace. Lt. Kidder was to deliver dispatches to Custer from General Sherman, but his party was attacked by Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne. Days later, Custer and a search party found the bodies of Kidder&#x27;s patrol.

Following the Hancock campaign, Custer was arrested and suspended at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, until August 12, 1868, for being absent without leave (AWOL), after having abandoned his post to see his wife. At the request of Major General Sheridan, who wanted him for his planned winter campaign against the Cheyenne, he was allowed to return to duty before his one year of suspension had expired and join his regiment on October 7, 1868. He then went on frontier duty, scouting in Kansas and Indian Territory through October 1869.

Under Sheridan&#x27;s orders, he took part in establishing Camp Supply in Indian Territory in early November 1868 as a supply base for the winter campaign. On November 27, 1868, he led the 7th Cavalry Regiment in an attack on the Cheyenne encampment of Chief Black Kettle – the Battle of Washita River. He reported killing 103 warriors; 53 women and children were taken as prisoners. Estimates by the Cheyenne of their casualties were substantially lower (11 warriors plus 19 women and children). Custer had his men shoot most of the 875 Indian ponies they had captured. The Battle of Washita River was regarded as the first substantial U.S. victory in the Southern Plains War, and it helped force a large portion of the Southern Cheyenne on to a U.S.-assigned reservation.

In 1873, he was sent to the Dakota Territory to protect a railroad survey party against the Lakota. On August 4, 1873, near the Tongue River, the 7th Cavalry Regiment clashed for the first time with the Lakota. One man on each side was killed. In 1874, Custer led an expedition into the Black Hills and announced the discovery of gold on French Creek near present-day Custer, South Dakota. Custer&#x27;s announcement triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Among the towns that immediately sprung up was Deadwood, South Dakota, notorious for its lawlessness.

==Grant, Belknap and politics==
In 1875, the Grant administration attempted to buy the Black Hills region from the Sioux. When the Sioux refused to sell, they were ordered to report to reservations by the end of January 1876. Mid-winter conditions made it impossible for them to comply. The administration labeled them &quot;hostiles&quot; and tasked the Army with bringing them in.

Custer was to command an expedition planned for the spring, part of a three-pronged campaign. While Custer&#x27;s expedition marched west from Fort Abraham Lincoln, near present-day Mandan, North Dakota, troops under Colonel John Gibbon were to march east from Fort Ellis, near present-day Bozeman, Montana, while a force under General George Crook was to march north from Fort Fetterman, near present-day Douglas, Wyoming.

Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry was originally scheduled to leave Fort Abraham Lincoln on April 6, 1876, but on March 15 he was summoned to Washington to testify at congressional hearings. Rep. Hiester Clymer&#x27;s Committee was investigating alleged corruption involving Secretary of War William W. Belknap (who had resigned March 2), along with President Grant&#x27;s brother Orville and traders granted monopolies at frontier Army posts. It was alleged that Belknap had been selling these lucrative trading post positions where soldiers were required to make their purchases. Custer himself had experienced first hand the high prices being charged at Fort Lincoln.

Concerned that he might miss the coming campaign, Custer did not want to go to Washington. He asked to answer questions in writing, but Clymer insisted. Recognizing that his testimony would be explosive, Custer tried &quot;to follow a moderate and prudent course, avoiding prominence.&quot; Despite this, he provided a quantity of unsubstantiated accusations against Belknap. His testimony, given on March 29 and April 4, was a sensation, being loudly praised by the Democratic press and sharply criticized by Republicans. Custer wrote articles published anonymously in &quot;The New York Herald&quot; that exposed trader post kickback rings and implied that Belknap was behind them. During his testimony, Custer attacked President Grant&#x27;s brother Orville on unproven grounds of extorting money in exchange for exerting undue influence. Historian Stephen E. Ambrose speculated that around this time Custer was presented with the idea of becoming the Democratic candidate in the upcoming 1876 United States presidential election, adding further motivation for Custer to rejoin his regiment and win further accolades in the Sioux Wars.

After Custer testified, Belknap was impeached, and the case sent to the Senate for trial. Custer asked the impeachment managers to release him from further testimony. With the help of a request from his superior, Brigadier General Alfred Terry, Commander of the Department of Dakota, he was excused. However, President Grant intervened, ordering that another officer fulfill Custer&#x27;s military duty.
General Terry protested, arguing that he had no available officers of rank qualified to replace Custer. Both Sheridan and Sherman wanted Custer in command, but had to support Grant. General Sherman, hoping to resolve the issue, advised Custer to meet personally with Grant before leaving Washington. Three times Custer requested meetings with the president, but each request was refused.

Finally, Custer gave up and took a train to Chicago on May 2, planning to rejoin his regiment. A furious Grant ordered Sheridan to arrest Custer for leaving Washington without permission. On May 3, a member of Sheridan&#x27;s staff arrested Custer as he arrived in Chicago. The arrest sparked public outrage. &quot;The New York Herald&quot; called Grant the &quot;modern Caesar&quot; and asked, &quot;Are officers... to be dragged from railroad trains and ignominiously ordered to stand aside until the whims of the Chief magistrate ... are satisfied?&quot;
Grant relented, but insisted that Terry—not Custer—personally command the expedition. Terry met Custer in St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 6. He later recalled that Custer &quot;with tears in his eyes, begged for my aid. How could I resist it?&quot; Custer and Terry both wrote telegrams to Grant asking that Custer be able to lead his regiment, with Terry in command. Sheridan endorsed the effort.

Grant was already under pressure for his treatment of Custer. His administration worried that if the &quot;Sioux campaign&quot; failed without Custer, then Grant would be blamed for ignoring the recommendations of senior Army officers. On May 8, Custer was told that he would lead the expedition, but only under Terry&#x27;s direct supervision.
Elated, Custer told General Terry&#x27;s chief engineer, Captain Ludlow, that he would &quot;cut loose&quot; from Terry and operate independently.

==Battle of the Little Bighorn==
 
By the time of Custer&#x27;s Black Hills expedition in 1874, the level of conflict and tension between the U.S. and many of the Plains Indians tribes (including the Lakota Sioux and the Cheyenne) had become exceedingly high. European-Americans continually broke treaty agreements and advanced further westward, resulting in violence and acts of depredation by both sides. To take possession of the Black Hills (and thus the gold deposits), and to stop Indian attacks, the U.S. decided to corral all remaining free Plains Indians. The Grant government set a deadline of January 31, 1876, for all Lakota and Arapaho wintering in the &quot;unceded territory&quot; to report to their designated agencies (reservations) or be considered &quot;hostile&quot;.
At that time, the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s regimental commander, Colonel Samuel D. Sturgis, was on detached duty as the Superintendent of Mounted Recruiting Service and in command of the Cavalry Depot in St. Louis, Missouri, which left Lieutenant Colonel Custer in command of the regiment. Custer and the 7th Cavalry departed from Fort Abraham Lincoln on May 17, 1876, part of a larger army force planning to round up remaining free Indians. Meanwhile, in the spring and summer of 1876, the Hunkpapa Lakota holy man Sitting Bull had called together the largest gathering of Plains Indians at Ash Creek, Montana (later moved to the Little Bighorn River) to discuss what to do about the whites. It was this united encampment of Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indians that the 7th Calvary met at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Crow Indian Reservation created in old Crow Country (in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, the valley of the Little Bighorn is in the heart of the Crow Indian treaty territory and was accepted as such by the Lakota, the Cheyenne, and the Arapaho). The Lakotas were staying in the valley without consent from the Crow tribe, which sided with the Army to expel the Indian invaders.

Around June 15, Major Marcus Reno while scouting, discovered the trail of a large village on the Rosebud River. On June 22, Custer&#x27;s entire regiment was detached to follow this trail. On June 25, some of Custer&#x27;s Crow Indian scouts identified what they claimed was a large Indian encampment in the valley near the Little Bighorn River. Custer had first intended to attack the Indian village the next day, but since his presence became known, he decided to attack immediately and divided his forces into three battalions: one led by Major Reno, one by Captain Frederick Benteen, and one by himself. Captain Thomas M. McDougall and Company B were with the pack train. Reno was sent north to charge the southern end of the encampment, Custer rode north, hidden to the east of the encampment by bluffs and planning to circle around and attack from the north, and Benteen was initially sent south and west to scout Indian presence and potentially protect the column from the south.

Reno began a charge on the southern end of the village, but halted some 500–600 yards short of the camp, and had his men dismount and form a skirmish line. They were soon overcome by mounted Lakota and Cheyenne warriors who counterattacked &quot;en masse&quot; against Reno&#x27;s exposed left flank, forcing Reno and his men to take cover in the trees along the river. Eventually, the troopers engaged in a bloody retreat up the bluffs above the river, where they made their stand. This opening action of the battle cost Reno a quarter of his command.

Custer may have seen Reno stop and form a skirmish line while he led his command to the northern end of the main encampment, where he may have planned to sandwich the Indians between his attacking troopers and Reno&#x27;s command in a &quot;hammer and anvil&quot; maneuver. According to Grinnell&#x27;s account, based on the testimony of the Cheyenne warriors who survived the fight, at least part of Custer&#x27;s command attempted to ford the river at the north end of the camp, but were driven off by Indian sharpshooters firing from the brush along the west bank of the river. From that point the soldiers were pursued by hundreds of warriors onto a ridge north of the encampment. Custer and his command were prevented from digging in by Crazy Horse. Those warriors had outflanked him and were now to his north, at the crest of the ridge. Traditional white accounts give credit to Gall for the attack that drove Custer up onto the ridge, but Indian witnesses have disputed that account.

For a time, Custer&#x27;s men appear to have been deployed by company, in standard cavalry fighting formation—the skirmish line, with every fourth man holding the horses, though this arrangement would have robbed Custer of a quarter of his firepower. Worse, as the fight intensified, many soldiers could have taken to holding their own horses or hobbling them, further reducing the 7th&#x27;s effective fire. When Crazy Horse and White Bull mounted the charge that broke through the center of Custer&#x27;s lines, order may have broken down among the soldiers of Calhoun&#x27;s command, though Myles Keogh&#x27;s men seem to have fought and died where they stood. According to some Lakota accounts, many of the panicked soldiers threw down their weapons and either rode or ran towards the knoll where Custer, the other officers, and about 40 men were making a stand. Along the way, the warriors rode them down, counting coup by striking the fleeing troopers with their quirts or lances.

Initially, Custer had 208 officers and men under his direct command, with an additional 142 under Reno, just over 100 under Benteen, and 50 soldiers with Captain McDougall&#x27;s rearguard, accompanied by 84 soldiers under 1st Lieutenant Edward Gustave Mathey with the pack train. The Lakota-Cheyenne coalition may have fielded over 1,800 warriors. Historian Gregory Michno settles on a low number of around 1,000 based on contemporary Lakota testimony, but other sources place the number at 1,800 or 2,000, especially in the works by Utley and Fox. The 1,800–2,000 figure is substantially lower than the higher numbers of 3,000 or more postulated by Ambrose, Gray, Scott, and others. Some of the other participants in the battle gave higher estimates:

:*Spotted Horn Bull – 5,000 braves and leaders
:*Maj. Reno – 2,500 to 5,000 warriors
:*Capt. Moylan – 3,500 to 4,000
:*Lt. Hare – not under 4,000
:*Lt. Godfrey – minimum between 2,500 and 3,000
:*Lt. Edgerly – 4,000
:*Lt. Varnum – not less than 4,000
:*Sgt. Kanipe – fully 4,000
:*George Herendeen – fully 3,000
:*Fred Gerard – 2,500 to 3,000

An average of the above is 3,500 Indian warriors and leaders.

As the troopers of Custer&#x27;s five companies were cut down, the native warriors stripped the dead of their firearms and ammunition, with the result that the return fire from the cavalry steadily decreased, while firing from the Indians constantly increased. The surviving troopers apparently shot their remaining horses to use as breastworks for a final stand on the knoll at the north end of the ridge. The warriors closed in for the final attack and killed every man in Custer&#x27;s command. As a result, the Battle of the Little Bighorn has come to be popularly known as &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;.

==Personal life==

On February 9, 1864, Custer married Elizabeth Clift Bacon (1842–1933), whom he had first seen when he was 10 years old. He had been socially introduced to her in November 1862, when home in Monroe on leave. She was not initially impressed with him, and her father, Judge Daniel Bacon, disapproved of Custer as a match because he was the son of a blacksmith. It was not until well after Custer had been promoted to the rank of brigadier general that he gained the approval of Judge Bacon. He married Elizabeth Bacon 14 months after they formally met.

In November 1868, following the Battle of Washita River, Custer was alleged (by Captain Frederick Benteen, chief of scouts Ben Clark, and Cheyenne oral tradition) to have unofficially married Mo-nah-se-tah, daughter of the Cheyenne chief Little Rock in the winter or early spring of 1868–1869 (Little Rock was killed in the one-day action at Washita on November 27). Mo-nah-se-tah gave birth to a child in January 1869, two months after the Washita battle. Cheyenne oral history tells that she also bore a second child fathered by Custer in late 1869. Some historians, however, believe that Custer had become sterile after contracting gonorrhea while at West Point and that the father was in actuality his brother Thomas. Clarke&#x27;s description in his memoirs included the statement, &quot;Custer picked out a fine looking one and had her in his tent every night.&quot;

In addition to &quot;Autie&quot;, Custer acquired several nicknames. During the Civil War, after his promotion to become the youngest brigadier general in the Army aged 23, the press called him &quot;The Boy General&quot;. During his years on the Great Plains in the American Indian Wars, his troopers referred to him with grudging admiration as &quot;Iron Butt&quot; and &quot;Hard Ass&quot; for his stamina in the saddle and strict discipline, as well as with the more derisive &quot;Ringlets&quot; for his long, curling blond hair, which he perfumed with cinnamon-scented hair oil.

Throughout his travels, he gathered geological specimens, sending them to the University of Michigan. On September 10, 1873, he wrote Libbie, &quot;the Indian battles hindered the collecting, while in that immediate region it was unsafe to go far from the command...&quot;

During his service in Kentucky, Custer bought thoroughbred horses. He took two on his last campaign, Vic (for Victory) and Dandy. During the march he changed horses every three hours. He rode Vic into his last battle. Custer took his two staghounds Tuck and Bleuch with him during the last expedition. He left them with orderly Burkman when he rode into battle. Burkman joined the packtrain. He regretted not accompanying Custer but lived until 1925, when he took his own life.

===Appearance===
Custer was fastidious in his grooming. Early in their marriage, Libbie wrote, &quot;He brushes his teeth after every meal. I always laugh at him for it, also for washing his hands so frequently.&quot; He was 5&#x27;11&quot; tall and wore a size 38 jacket and size 9C boots. At various times he weighed between 143 pounds (at the end of the 1869 Kansas campaign) and a muscular 170 pounds. A splendid horseman, &quot;Custer mounted was an inspiration.&quot; He was quite fit, able to jump to a standing position from lying flat on his back. He was a &quot;power sleeper&quot;, able to get by on short naps after falling asleep immediately on lying down. He &quot;had a habit of throwing himself prone on the grass for a few minutes&#x27; rest and resembled a human island, entirely surrounded by crowding, panting dogs.&quot;

The common media image of Custer&#x27;s appearance at the Last Stand—buckskin coat and long, curly blonde hair—is wrong. Although he and several other officers wore buckskin coats on the expedition, they took them off and packed them away because it was so hot. According to Soldier, an Arikara scout, &quot;Custer took off his buckskin coat and tied it behind his saddle.&quot; Further, Custer—whose hair was thinning—joined a similarly balding Lieutenant Varnum and &quot;had the clippers run over their heads&quot; before leaving Fort Lincoln.

==Death==
It is unlikely that any Native American recognized Custer during or after the battle. Michno summarizes: &quot;Shave Elk said, &#x27;We did not suspect that we were fighting Custer and did not recognize him either alive or dead.&#x27; Wooden Leg said no one could recognize any enemy during the fight, for they were too far away. The Cheyennes did not even know a man named Custer was in the fight until weeks later. Antelope said none knew of Custer being at the fight until they later learned of it at the agencies. Thomas Marquis learned from his interviews that no Indian knew Custer was at the Little Bighorn fight until months later. Many Cheyennes were not even aware that other members of the Custer family had been in the fight until 1922 when Marquis himself first informed them of that fact.&quot;

Several individuals claimed responsibility for killing Custer, including White Bull of the Miniconjous, Rain-in-the-Face, Flat Lip, and Brave Bear. In June 2005, at a public meeting, Northern Cheyenne storytellers said that according to their oral tradition, Buffalo Calf Road Woman, a Northern Cheyenne heroine of the Battle of the Rosebud, struck the final blow against Custer, which knocked him off his horse before he died. She hit him with a club-like instrument.

A contrasting version of Custer&#x27;s death is suggested by the testimony of an Oglala named Joseph White Cow Bull, according to novelist and Custer biographer Evan Connell. He says that Joseph White Bull stated he had shot a rider wearing a buckskin jacket and big hat at the riverside when the soldiers first approached the village from the east. The initial force facing the soldiers, according to this version, was quite small (possibly as few as four warriors) yet challenged Custer&#x27;s command. The rider who was hit had shouted orders that prompted the soldiers to attack and was next to a rider who bore a flag, but when the buckskin-clad rider fell off his horse after being shot, many of the attackers reined up. The allegation that the buckskin-clad officer was Custer, if accurate, might explain the supposed rapid disintegration of Custer&#x27;s forces. However, several other officers of the Seventh, including William Cooke, Tom Custer and William Sturgis, were also dressed in buckskin on the day of the battle, and the fact that each of the non-mutilation wounds to George Custer&#x27;s body (a bullet wound below the heart and a shot to the left temple) would have been instantly fatal casts doubt on his being wounded or killed at the ford, more than a mile from where his body was found. The circumstances are, however, consistent with David Humphreys Miller&#x27;s suggestion that Custer&#x27;s subordinates would not have left his dead body behind to be desecrated.

During the 1920s, two elderly Cheyenne women spoke briefly with oral historians about their having recognized Custer&#x27;s body on the battlefield and said that they had stopped a Sioux warrior from desecrating the body. The women were relatives of Mo-nah-se-tah, who was allegedly borne two children by him. Mo-nah-se-tah was among 53 Cheyenne women and children taken captive by the 7th Cavalry after the Battle of Washita River in 1868, in which Custer commanded an attack on the camp of Chief Black Kettle. Mo-nah-se-tah&#x27;s father, Cheyenne chief Little Rock, was killed in the battle.

During the winter and early spring of 1868–1869, Custer reportedly sexually assaulted teenage Mo-nah-se-tah. Cheyenne oral history alleges that she later bore Custer&#x27;s child in late 1869. (Custer, however, had apparently become sterile after contracting venereal disease at West Point, leading some historians to believe that the father was really his brother Thomas). In the Cheyenne culture of the time, such a relationship was considered a marriage. The women allegedly told the warrior: &quot;Stop, he is a relative of ours,&quot; and then shooed him away. The two women said they shoved their sewing awls into his ears to permit Custer&#x27;s corpse to &quot;hear better in the afterlife&quot; because he had broken his promise to Stone Forehead never to fight against Native Americans again.

When the main column under General Terry arrived two days later, the army found most of the soldiers&#x27; corpses stripped, scalped, and mutilated. Custer&#x27;s body had two bullet holes, one in the left temple and one just below the heart. Capt. Benteen, who inspected the body, stated that in his opinion the fatal injuries had not been the result of .45 caliber ammunition, which implies the bullet holes had been caused by ranged rifle fire. Some time later, Lieutenant Edward S. Godfrey described Custer&#x27;s mutilation, telling Charles F. Bates, that an arrow &quot;had been forced up his penis.&quot;

The bodies of Custer and his brother Tom were wrapped in canvas and blankets, then buried in a shallow grave, covered by the basket from a travois held in place by rocks. When soldiers returned a year later, the brothers&#x27; grave had been scavenged by animals and the bones scattered. &quot;Not more than a double handful of small bones were picked up.&quot; Custer was reinterred with full military honors at West Point Cemetery on October 10, 1877. The battle site was designated a National Cemetery in 1886.

==Controversial legacy==
===Public relations and media coverage during his lifetime===
Custer has been called a &quot;media personality&quot;, and he valued good public relations and used the print media of his era effectively. He frequently invited journalists to accompany his campaigns (one, Associated Press reporter Mark Kellogg, died at the Little Bighorn), and their favorable reporting contributed to his high reputation, which lasted well into the latter 20th century. Effusive praise from William Eleroy Curtis, the first journalist to report the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, laid the foundation for Custer&#x27;s status as a tragic hero who furthered the &quot;manifest destiny&quot; of the United States.

Custer enjoyed writing, often writing all night long. Before leaving the steamer &quot;Far West&quot; for the final leg of the journey, Custer wrote all night. His orderly John Burkman stood guard in front of his tent and on the morning of June 22, 1876, found Custer &quot;hunched over on the cot, just his coat and his boots off, and the pen still in his hand.&quot; Custer wrote a series of magazine articles of his experiences on the frontier, which were published in book form as &quot;My Life on the Plains&quot; in 1874. The work is still a valued primary source for information on U.S.-Native relations.

===Posthumous legacy===

After his death, Custer achieved lasting fame. Custer&#x27;s wife Elizabeth, who had accompanied him in many of his frontier expeditions, did much to advance his fame with the publication of several books about her late husband: &quot;Boots and Saddles, Life with General Custer in Dakota&quot;, &quot;Tenting on the Plains, or General Custer in Kansas and Texas&quot; and &quot;Following the Guidon&quot;., thus furthering a &quot;Custer myth&quot;. The emergence of this myth was also supported by the secrecy of the Official Record of the 1879 Court of Inquiry, which was not released until 1951.

The deaths of Custer and his troops became the best-known episode in the history of the American Indian Wars, due in part to a painting commissioned by the brewery Anheuser-Busch as part of an advertising campaign. The enterprising company ordered reprints of a dramatic work that depicted &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; and had them framed and hung in many United States saloons. This created lasting impressions of the battle and the brewery&#x27;s products in the minds of many bar patrons. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote an adoring (and in some places, erroneous) poem. President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s lavish praise pleased Custer&#x27;s widow.

President Grant, a highly successful general but recent antagonist, criticized Custer&#x27;s actions in the battle of the Little Bighorn. Quoted in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; on September 2, 1876, Grant said, &quot;I regard Custer&#x27;s Massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary – wholly unnecessary.&quot; General Phillip Sheridan took a more moderately critical view of Custer&#x27;s final military actions.

General Nelson Miles (who inherited Custer&#x27;s mantle of famed Indian fighter) and others praised him as a fallen hero betrayed by the incompetence of subordinate officers. Miles noted the difficulty of winning a fight &quot;with seven-twelfths of the command remaining out of the engagement when within sound of his rifle shots.&quot;

The assessment of Custer&#x27;s actions during the American Indian Wars has undergone substantial reconsideration in modern times. Documenting the arc of popular perception in his biography &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot; (1984), author Evan S. Connell notes the reverential tone of Custer&#x27;s first biographer Frederick Whittaker (whose book was rushed out the year of Custer&#x27;s death.) Connell concludes:

These days it is stylish to denigrate the general, whose stock sells for nothing. Nineteenth-century Americans thought differently. At that time he was a cavalier without fear and beyond reproach.In the same year, W.A. Graham stated in &quot;The Custer Myth&quot;:But for the &quot;blaze of glory&quot; that formed the setting for his dramatically tragic departure at the hands of yelling savages, he would probably be just another name of a long list of names in our histories of the Civil War, in which as &quot;The Boy General&quot; he made an outstanding record as a leader of Cavalry, as did also numerous others who have been long since all but forgotten.

===Criticism and controversy===
====Debate over tactics====

The controversy over blame for the disaster at Little Bighorn continues to this day. Major Marcus Reno&#x27;s failure to press his attack on the south end of the Lakota/Cheyenne village and his flight to the timber along the river after a single casualty have been cited as a factor in the destruction of Custer&#x27;s battalion, as has Captain Frederick Benteen&#x27;s allegedly tardy arrival on the field and the failure of the two officers&#x27; combined forces to move toward the relief of Custer.
Some of Custer&#x27;s critics have asserted tactical errors.
* While camped at Powder River, Custer refused the support offered by General Terry on June 21 of an additional four companies of the Second Cavalry. Custer stated that he &quot;could whip any Indian village on the Plains&quot; with his own regiment and that extra troops would simply be a burden.
* At the same time, he left behind at the steamer &quot;Far West&quot; on the Yellowstone and a battery of Gatling guns, although he knew he was facing superior numbers. Before leaving the camp, all the troops, including the officers, also boxed their sabers and sent them back with the wagons.
* On the day of the battle, Custer divided his 600-man command, despite being faced with vastly superior numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne.
* The refusal of an extra battalion reduced the size of his force by at least a sixth, and rejecting the firepower offered by the Gatling guns played into the events of June 25 to the disadvantage of his regiment.

Custer&#x27;s defenders, however, including historian Charles K. Hofling, have asserted that Gatling guns would have been slow and cumbersome as the troops crossed the rough country between the Yellowstone and the Little Bighorn. Custer rated speed in gaining the battlefield as essential and more important. Supporters of Custer claim that splitting the forces was a standard tactic, so as to demoralize the enemy with the appearance of the cavalry in different places all at once, especially when a contingent threatened the line of retreat.

====Attacks on Indigenous peoples====

Sharply criticizing the self-styled &quot;Indian fighter&quot;, U.S. Indigenous people&#x27;s organized movements have emphasized Custer&#x27;s role in the U.S. government&#x27;s treaty violations and other injustices against Native Americans.

Standing Rock Sioux theologian and author Vine Deloria Jr. made a comparison between Custer and Nazi SS officer Adolf Eichmann, referring to Custer as the &quot;Eichmann of the Plains&quot; in a 1996 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview. In his 1969 book &quot;Custer Died for Your Sins,&quot; Deloria condemned Custer&#x27;s violations of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty that established the Black Hills region as unceded territory of the Sioux and Arapaho peoples. Custer&#x27;s violations of the Fort Laramie Treaty included an 1874 gold expedition and the 1876 Battle of Greasy Grass (Battle of the Little Bighorn).

Critics have also highlighted Custer&#x27;s 1868 Washita River surprise attack that killed Cheyenne non-combatants including mothers, children, and elders. Custer was following Generals William Sherman and Philip Sheridan&#x27;s orders for &quot;total war&quot; on the Indigenous nations. Describing total war methods, Sherman wrote, &quot;We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women, and children...during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.&quot; There is credible evidence that, following the attack, Custer and his men sexually assaulted female captives. Another historian writes, &quot;There was a saying among the soldiers of the western frontier, a saying Custer and his officers could heartily endorse: &#x27;Indian women rape easy.&#x27;&quot;

Indigenous criticism of Custer&#x27;s posthumous legacy may have begun immediately after Custer died. Good Fox (Lakota) recounted:
&quot;I was told that after the battle two Cheyenne women came across Custer&#x27;s body. They knew him, because he had attacked their peaceful village on the Washita. These women said, &#x27;You smoked the peace pipe with us. Our chiefs told you that you would be killed if you ever made war on us again. But you would not listen. This will make you hear better.&#x27; The women each took an awl from their beaded cases and stuck them deep into Custer&#x27;s ears.&quot;

In 1976, the American Indian Movement (AIM) celebrated the centennial of Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho victory in the Battle of Greasy Grass, performing a victory dance around the marker of Custer&#x27;s death. AIM continued protesting there, demanding the official renaming of the &quot;Custer Battlefield,&quot; finally winning this demand in 1991.

In May 2021, the United Tribes of Michigan unanimously passed a resolution calling for the removal of a Custer statue in Monroe, Michigan. The resolution stated in part:

&quot;(It) is widely perceived as offensive and a painful public reminder of the legacy of Indigenous people&#x27;s genocide and present realities of systemic racism in our country... Custer is notoriously known as the &#x27;Indian Killer&#x27; [...] Custer does not deserve any glory, nor the right to further torment minoritized citizens 145 years postmortem.&quot;
==Monuments and memorials==

<doc id="102745" wikidata="Q206191" url="?curid=102745" title="Abigail Adams">
<text>Abigail Adams (&quot;née&quot; Smith; – October 28, 1818) was the wife and closest advisor of John Adams, the second president of the United States, and the mother of John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. She was a founder of the United States, and was both the first second lady and second first lady of the United States, although such titles were not used at the time. She and Barbara Bush are the only two women in American history who were both married to a U.S. president and the mother of a U.S. president.

Adams&#x27;s life is one of the most documented of the first ladies; many of the letters she wrote to her husband John Adams while he was in Philadelphia as a delegate in the Continental Congress prior and during the American Revolution document the closeness and versatility of their relationship. John Adams frequently sought the advice of Abigail on many matters, and their letters are filled with intellectual discussions on government and politics. Her letters also serve as eyewitness accounts of the American Revolutionary War home front.

Surveys of historians conducted periodically by the Siena College Research Institute since 1982 have consistently found Adams to rank as one of the three most highly regarded first ladies by historians.

==Early life and family (1744–1759)==

Abigail Adams was born on November 22, 1744, at the North Parish Congregational Church in Weymouth, Massachusetts, to William Smith and Elizabeth (née Quincy) Smith. On her mother&#x27;s side, she was descended from the Quincy family, a well-known political family in the Massachusetts colony. Through her mother she was a cousin of Dorothy Quincy, who was married to John Hancock. Adams was also the great-granddaughter of John Norton, founding pastor of Old Ship Church in Hingham, Massachusetts, the only remaining 17th-century Puritan meetinghouse in Massachusetts. Smith married Elizabeth Quincy in 1740, and together they had three daughters and a son; Abigail was the second child. As with several of her ancestors, Adams&#x27;s father was a liberal Congregational minister: a leader in a Yankee society that held its clergy in high esteem. Smith did not focus his preaching on predestination or original sin; instead he emphasized the importance of reason and morality. In July 1775 his wife Elizabeth, with whom he had been married for 35 years, died of smallpox. In 1784, at age 77, Smith died.

The Smith family were slaveholders and are known to have owned at least four people. A slave named Phoebe took a caretaking role to Abigail and other children; later on she would work as a paid servant for Abigail after she became free. Abigail would come to express anti-slavery beliefs as an adult.

Abigail did not receive formal schooling; she was frequently sick as a child, something which may have been a factor preventing her from receiving an education. Later in life, Adams would also consider that she was deprived an education because females were rarely given such an opportunity. Although she did not receive a formal education, her mother taught her and her sisters to read, write and cipher; her father&#x27;s, uncle&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s large libraries enabled the sisters to study English and French literature. Her grandmother, Elizabeth Quincy, also contributed to Adams&#x27;s education. As she grew up, Adams read with friends in an effort to further her learning. She became one of the most erudite women ever to serve as first lady.

==Marriage and children (1759–1783)==
Abigail Smith first met John Adams when she was 15 years old in 1759. Meanwhile, John accompanied his friend Richard Cranch to the Smith household. Cranch was engaged to Abigail&#x27;s older sister, Mary Smith, and they would be the parents of federal judge William Cranch. Adams reported finding the Smith sisters neither &quot;fond, nor frank, nor candid.&quot;

Although Abigail&#x27;s father approved of the match, her mother was appalled that her daughter would marry a country lawyer whose manner still reeked of the farm. Eventually, she gave in, and the couple married on October 25, 1764, in the Smiths&#x27; home in Weymouth. William Smith, Abigail&#x27;s father, presided over the marriage. After the reception, the couple mounted a single horse and rode off to their new home, the saltbox house and farm John had inherited from his father in Braintree, Massachusetts (a location that is now part of Quincy). The couple welcomed their first child nine months into their marriage.

In 12 years, Abigail Adams gave birth to six children:
* Abigail (&quot;Nabby&quot;; 1765–1813)
* John Quincy (1767–1848)
* Susanna (nicknamed &quot;Suky&quot;) (1768–1770)
* Charles (1770–1800)
* Thomas (1772–1832)
* Elizabeth (stillborn in 1777)

Her childrearing style included relentless and continual reminders of what the children owed to virtue and the Adams tradition. Adams was responsible for family and farm when her husband was on his long trips. &quot;Alas!&quot;, she wrote in December 1773, &quot;How many snow banks divide thee and me.&quot; Abigail and John&#x27;s marriage is well documented through their correspondence and other writings. Letters exchanged throughout John&#x27;s political obligations indicate his trust in Abigail&#x27;s knowledge was sincere. Like her husband, Abigail often quoted literature in her letters. Historian David McCullough claims that she did so &quot;more readily&quot; than her husband. Their correspondence illuminated their mutual emotional and intellectual respect. John often excused himself to Abigail for his &quot;vanity&quot;, exposing his need for her approval.

John Adams moved the family to Boston in April 1768, renting a clapboard house on Brattle Street that was known locally as the &quot;White House&quot;. He and Abigail and the children lived there for a year, then moved to Cold Lane; still later, they moved again to a larger house in Brattle Square in the center of the city.

John&#x27;s growing law practice required changes for the family. In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children back to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, hoping the time away from his family would allow him to focus on his work. Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and &quot;vulgar&quot; Braintree as a home for his family, and thus, in August 1772, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Abigail and John returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.

Abigail also took responsibility for the family&#x27;s financial matters, including investments. Her investments made through her uncle Cotton Tufts in debt instruments issued to finance the Revolutionary War were rewarded after Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s First Report on the Public Credit endorsed full federal payment at face value to holders of government securities. One recent researcher even credits Abigail&#x27;s financial acumen with providing for the Adams family&#x27;s wealth through the end of John&#x27;s lifetime.

==Europe (1784–1788)==
In 1784, Abigail and her daughter Nabby joined her husband and her eldest son, John Quincy, at her husband&#x27;s diplomatic post in Paris. Abigail had dreaded the thought of the long sea voyage, but in fact found the journey interesting. At first, she found life in Paris difficult and was rather overwhelmed by the novel experience of running a large house with a retinue of servants. However, as the months passed, she began to enjoy herself: she made numerous friends, discovered a fondness for the theatre and opera, and was fascinated by Parisian women&#x27;s fashions, although she ruefully admitted that she &quot;would never be in the mode.&quot;

After 1785, she filled the role of wife of the first U.S. minister to the Court of St James&#x27;s (Britain). In contrast to Paris, Abigail disliked London, where she had few friends and was, in general, cold-shouldered by polite society. One pleasant experience was her temporary guardianship of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s young daughter Mary (Polly), for whom Abigail came to feel a deep and lifelong love.

She and John returned in 1788 to their home in Quincy, Peacefield (also known as the &quot;Old House&quot;), which she set about vigorously enlarging and remodeling. It still stands and is open to the public as part of Adams National Historical Park.

==First Lady (1797–1801)==
John Adams was inaugurated as the second president of the United States on March 4, 1797, in Philadelphia at the age of 61. Abigail was not present at her husband&#x27;s inauguration as she was tending to his dying 89-year-old mother. When John was elected President of the United States, Abigail continued a formal pattern of entertaining. She held a large dinner each week, made frequent public appearances, and provided for entertainment for the city of Philadelphia each Fourth of July.

She took an active role in politics and policy, unlike the quiet presence of Martha Washington. Abigail was so politically active, her political opponents came to refer to her as &quot;Mrs. President&quot;. As John&#x27;s confidant, Abigail was often well informed on issues facing her husband&#x27;s administration, at times including details of current events not yet known to the public in letters to her sister Mary and her son John Quincy. Some people used Abigail to contact the president. At times Abigail planted favorable stories about her husband in the press. Abigail remained a staunch supporter of her husband&#x27;s political career, supporting his policies, such as passing the Alien and Sedition Acts.

Adams brought the children of her brother William Smith, her brother-in-law John Shaw, and her son Charles to live in the President&#x27;s House during her husband&#x27;s presidency because the children&#x27;s fathers all struggled with alcoholism. Charles&#x27;s daughter, Susanna, was just 3 years old in 1800 when Adams brought her to live in the President&#x27;s House in Philadelphia days before Charles&#x27;s death.

With the relocation of the capital to Washington, D.C. in 1800, she became the first First Lady to reside at the White House, or President&#x27;s House as it was then known. Adams moved into the White House in November 1800, living there for only the last four months of her husband&#x27;s term. At this time, the city of Washington D.C. was wilderness, with the President&#x27;s House far from completion. She found the unfinished mansion in Washington &quot;habitable&quot; and the location &quot;beautiful&quot;; but she complained that, despite the thick woods nearby, she could find no one willing to chop and haul firewood for the First Family. Abigail used the East Room of the White House to hang up the laundry. Adams&#x27;s health, never robust, suffered in Washington.

== Later life (1801–1818) ==

After John&#x27;s defeat in his presidential re-election campaign, the family retired to Peacefield in Quincy in 1800. Abigail followed her son&#x27;s political career earnestly, as her letters to her contemporaries show. In later years, she renewed correspondence with Thomas Jefferson, having reached out to him upon the death of his daughter Maria Jefferson Eppes (Polly), whom Abigail had cared for and come to love when Polly was a small child in London, even though Jefferson&#x27;s political opposition to her husband had hurt her deeply. She continued to raise her granddaughter Susanna. She also raised her elder grandchildren, including George Washington Adams and a younger John Adams, while their father John Quincy Adams was minister to Russia. Adams&#x27;s 48-year-old daughter, Nabby, died of breast cancer in 1813, after having endured three years of severe pain.

==Death==

Abigail Adams became ill during her final years. She died in her home on October 28, 1818, of typhoid fever. She was buried in what was to become the family crypt, which now also holds her husband John, their son John Quincy, and John Quincy&#x27;s wife Louisa, located in the United First Parish Church (also known as the &quot;Church of the Presidents&quot;) in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was 73 years old, exactly two weeks shy of her 74th birthday. Her last words were, &quot;Do not grieve, my friend, my dearest friend. I am ready to go. And John, it will not be long.&quot; Less than eight years later, on July 4, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, her husband died of heart failure at the age of 90. He was buried next to her in the family crypt in the United First Parish Church.

==Political viewpoints==
Biographer Lynne Withey argues for her conservatism because she: &quot;feared revolution; she valued stability, believed that family and religion were the essential props of social order, and considered inequality a social necessity&quot;. Her 18th-century mindset held that &quot;improved legal and social status for women was not inconsistent with their essentially domestic role.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s rights===
Abigail Adams wrote about the troubles and concerns she had as an 18th-century woman. She was an advocate of married women&#x27;s property rights and more opportunities for women, particularly in the field of education. Women, she believed, should not submit to laws not made in their interest, nor should they be content with the simple role of being companions to their husbands; they should educate themselves and thus be recognized for their intellectual capabilities so they could guide and influence the lives of their children and husbands. She is known for her March 1776 letter to John and the Continental Congress, requesting that they, &quot;remember the ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation.&quot;

John declined Abigail&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary code of laws&quot;, but acknowledged to Abigail, &quot;We have only the name of masters, and rather than give up this, which would completely subject us to the despotism of the petticoat, I hope General Washington and all our brave heroes would fight.&quot;

===Slavery and race===
Adams opposed the existence of slavery in the United States and saw it as a threat to American democracy. In a letter she wrote on March 31, 1776, Adams doubted that the majority of White people in Virginia had such &quot;passion for Liberty&quot; as they claimed they did, since they &quot;deprive[d] their fellow Creatures&quot; of freedom.

A notable incident regarding Adams&#x27;s views on race happened in Philadelphia in 1791, when a free black youth came to her house asking to be taught how to read and write. Adams subsequently placed the boy in a local evening school, though not without objections from a neighbor. Adams responded that he was &quot;a Freeman as much as any of the young Men and merely because his face is black, is he to be denied instruction? How is he to be qualified to procure a livelihood? ... I have not thought it any disgrace to my self to take him into my parlor and teach him both to read and write.&quot;

Despite her abolitionist views, Adams still held racist views during her life. After attending a 1785 production of &quot;Othello&quot; in London, Adams wrote in a letter of her &quot;disgust and horror&quot; at seeing the play&#x27;s titular protagonist, a Black man, touching the character of Desdemona, a White woman. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed stated that Adams&#x27;s views on race were in line with a &quot;typical white person of the 18th century&quot;.

==Religious beliefs==
Adams was an active member of First Parish Church in Quincy, which became Unitarian in doctrine by 1753. Her theological views evolved over the course of her life. In a letter to her son near the end of her life, dated May 5, 1816, she wrote of her religious beliefs:

She also asked Louisa Adams in a letter dated January 3, 1818, &quot;When will Mankind be convinced that true Religion is from the Heart, between Man and his creator, and not the imposition of Man or creeds and tests?&quot;

==Legacy==
Historian Joseph Ellis has found that the 1,200 letters between John and Abigail &quot;constituted a treasure trove of unexpected intimacy and candor, more revealing than any other correspondence between a prominent American husband and wife in American history.&quot; Ellis concluded that Abigail, although self-educated, was a better and more colorful letter-writer than John, even though John was one of the best letter-writers of the age. Ellis argues that Abigail was the more resilient and more emotionally balanced of the two, and calls her one of the most extraordinary women in American history.

===Memorials===

The Abigail Adams Cairn – a mound of rough stones – crowns the nearby Penn Hill from which she and her son, John Quincy Adams, watched the Battle of Bunker Hill and the burning of Charlestown. At that time she was minding the children of Dr. Joseph Warren, president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, who was killed in the battle.

One of the subpeaks of New Hampshire&#x27;s Mount Adams (whose main peak is named for her husband) is named in her honor.

In 2003, Adams was one of three women honored in a bronze sculpture as part of the Boston&#x27;s Women Memorial on the Commonwealth Avenue Mall in Boston.

In 2022, a seven-foot tall bronze statue of Adams was unveiled in Quincy, Massachusetts, on the Hancock Adams Common.

An Adams Memorial has been proposed in Washington, D.C., honoring Adams, her husband, her son, and other members of their family.

===Popular culture===
Passages from Adams&#x27;s letters to her husband figured prominently in songs from the Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot;. Virginia Vestoff played Adams in the original 1969 Broadway production of &quot;1776&quot; and recreated the role for the film version in 1972. On television, Kathryn Walker and Leora Dana portrayed Adams in the 1976 PBS mini-series &quot;The Adams Chronicles&quot;. In the mini-series &quot;John Adams&quot;, which premiered in March 2008 on HBO, she was played by Laura Linney. Linney enjoyed portraying Adams, saying that &quot;she is a woman of both passion and principle.&quot; A revolution-era Abigail, circa 1781, is portrayed by Michelle Trachtenberg, on the television series, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, in the season 2 episode, &quot;Pittura Infamante&quot; (January 19, 2015), her assistance being crucial in ending a series of unexplained murders from the period. Adams is a featured figure on Judy Chicago&#x27;s installation piece &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, being represented as one of the 999 names on the &quot;Heritage Floor&quot;. Novelist Barbara Hambly, writing as Barbara Hamilton, wrote three historical mysteries set in the early 1770s told from Abigail Adams&#x27;s perspective (and featuring Abigail as the detective): &quot;The Ninth Daughter&quot; (2009), &quot;A Marked Man&quot; (2010), and &quot;Sup with the Devil&quot; (2011).

===Portrait on currency===
The First Spouse Program under the Presidential $1 Coin Program authorizes the United States Mint to issue half-ounce $10 gold coins and bronze medal duplicates to honor the first spouses of the United States. The Abigail Adams coin was released on June 19, 2007, and sold out in just hours. She is pictured on the back of the coin writing her most famous letter to John Adams. In February 2009 &quot;Coin World&quot; reported that some 2007 Abigail Adams medals were struck using the reverse from the 2008 Louisa Adams medal, apparently by mistake. These pieces, called mules, were contained within the 2007 First Spouse medal set. The U.S. Mint has not released an estimate of how many mules were made.

===Regard by historians===
Since 1982, Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Adams has ranked among the three-most highly regarded first ladies in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Adams has been ranked:
*2nd-best of 42 in 1982
*3rd-best of 37 in 1993
*2nd-best of 38 in 2003
*2nd-best of 38 in 2008
*2nd-best of 39 in 2014

In the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Adams was ranked in the top-four of all criteria, ranking the third-highest in of background, second-highest in intelligence, 3rd-highest in value to the country, third-highest in being her &quot;own woman&quot;, second-highest in integrity, 3rd-highest in her accomplishments, 3rd-highest in courage, second-highest in leadership, fourth-highest in public image, and second-highest in her value to the president. In the 2014 survey, Adams and her husband were ranked the 5th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<text>Ratzeburg (; Low German: &quot;Ratzborg&quot;) is a town in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is surrounded by four lakes—the resulting isthmuses between the lakes form the access lanes to the town. Ratzeburg is the capital of the district Herzogtum Lauenburg.

==History==
The town was founded in the 11th century as Racisburg. The name is traditionally derived from the local Wendish ruler, Prince Ratibor of the Polabians, who was nicknamed Ratse. In the year 1044 Christian missionaries under the leadership of the monk Ansverus came into the region and built a monastery. It was destroyed in a pagan rebellion in 1066; the monks were stoned to death. Today monuments to the missionaries in two of the town&#x27;s churches commemorate these events. Ansverus was canonised in the 12th century and his relics were entombed in the Ratzeburg cathedral.

Henry the Lion became the ruler of the town in 1143 and established a bishopric in 1154. He was also responsible for the construction of the late Romanesque Cathedral (&quot;Dom&quot;), built in typical north German &#x27;red-brick&#x27; style. Henry also prompted the construction of the similar-looking Lübeck Cathedral and Brunswick Collegiate Church with his remains interred in the latter.

Since 1180 part of Ratzeburg diocesan area formed a Prince Bishopric, whose ruler was sovereign and as such had a vote at the Imperial Diet. The Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg was the last state in Northern Germany remaining Catholic. After the 1550 death of its ruler Prince-Bishop Georg von Blumenthal, who feuded with Thomas Aderpul, the bishopric converted to Lutheranism in 1554.

Though the town of Ratzeburg was part of the Ratzeburg diocese, the town itself was not within the territory of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg, but formed a part of the old Duchy of Saxony and became part of its dynastic partition of Saxe-Lauenburg around 1296, remaining with this duchy under altering dynasties until 1876. The cathedral quarter again formed an immunity district (Domfreiheit; cf. also Liberty) to the prince-bishopric, secularised as a principality in 1648. In 1619 Saxe-Lauenburg&#x27;s capital was moved from Lauenburg upon Elbe to Ratzeburg and remained there since. The town was almost completely destroyed in 1693, when Christian V of Denmark reduced Ratzeburg to rubble by bombardment in his unsuccessful attempt to push through his succession to the dukedom against the prevailing House of Hanover. After this event Ratzeburg was rebuilt in baroque style. The castle, however, was never reconstructed or built anew.

Ratzeburg briefly was part of the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars, afterwards the Duchy of (Saxe-)Lauenburg was awarded in personal union to the Danish crown in the Congress of Vienna. After the Danish crown lost Lauenburg in the Second Schleswig War (1864), Lauenburg&#x27;s estates of the realm offered the dukedom to the Prussian Hohenzollern dynasty in personal union, who accepted in 1865. On 1 July 1876 the Duchy of Lauenburg merged into the Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s Province of Schleswig-Holstein, forming the still existing district Herzogtum Lauenburg (Duchy of Lauenburg) seated in Ratzeburg. The former cathedral immunity district, at last a part of Mecklenburg, finally became part of the town of Ratzeburg with the 1937 Greater Hamburg Act.

From 1945 to 1989 the Iron Curtain ran just east of the town, putting it on the border with the German Democratic Republic.

==Sport==
Ratzeburg is known for its Olympic champion Ratzeburg Rowing Club, which was responsible for training, among others, the gold medalists at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. The grave of Ernst Barlach, perhaps the most notable creative artist to have made his home in Ratzeburg, is located in one of the town&#x27;s cemeteries.

<doc id="102775" wikidata="Q138367" url="?curid=102775" title="Camden, New Jersey">
<text>Camden is a city in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the Delaware Valley metropolitan region. The city was incorporated on February 13, 1828. Camden has been the county seat of Camden County since the county&#x27;s formation on March 13, 1844. The city derives its name from Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden. Camden is made up of over 20 neighborhoods, and is part of the South Jersey region of the state. 

The initial growth of Camden industrially is often credited to the “big three” employers of Camden: RCA Victor, Campbell&#x27;s Soup Company and New York Shipbuilding Corporation. The &quot;big three&quot; felt compelled to move away from Camden in the mid-to-late-20th century as they could find cheaper workers elsewhere. Though the city has declined in recent decades since the decline of heavy industry in the area and whiteflight to the suburbs, the city has made efforts to revitalize itself through various infrastructure and community projects.

Projects such as the redevelopment of the waterfront area brought three tourist attractions to the area: the USS &quot;New Jersey&quot;, the Freedom Mortgage Pavilion and the Adventure Aquarium. The city is the home of Rutgers University–Camden, which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926, and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, which opened in 2012. Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. Camden County College and Rowan University also have campuses in downtown Camden. The &quot;eds and meds&quot; institutions account for roughly 45% of Camden&#x27;s total employment.

Once known for violent crime, the restructuring of the police force in 2013 has been credited for the decrease in that number. As of January 2021, violent crime was down 46% from its high in the 1990s and at the lowest level since the 1960s. Overall crime reports in 2020 were down 74% compared to 1974, the first year of uniform crime-reporting in the city.

==History==
=== Prehistory ===
The city traces back to local indigenous Lenape, who are believed to have inhabited this area 13–15,000 years prior to the first European settlers. 

=== Settlement years (1623–1701) ===
Between 1623 and 1627, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May, an officer with the Dutch West India Company and first director of New Netherland, established Fort Nassau, where the Delaware River meets Big Timber Creek, which is today known as Brooklawn. In 1633, David Pietersen De Vries, a Dutch commander, was sailing up the Delaware River when he came across Natives in control of the fort. The settlers that had been left at the fort had decided to return to New Amsterdam (&quot;Today&quot; Manhattan, New York). Wouter van Twiller, Governor of New Netherland, restored Fort Nassau. He was accused of extravagant spending in the fort&#x27;s reconstruction. The settlement subsequently sparked competition from European Settlers over control of the fur trade in the area. The fort was used by the Dutch until around 1650 or 1651 when it was decided that it was far to up the river to be of any value. The buildings and stockades were demolished and Wouter van Twiller assigned Arent Corssen to find a place for another fort. 

The British first had a presence in the area in 1634. On June 21, 1634, Sir Edmund Ployden was given a charter from King Charles I of England for all territory that lies between New England and Maryland. After the Restoration in 1660, previous claims were largely overwritten, the land around Camden was then controlled by different nobles serving under King Charles II that those associated with Sir Edmund Ployden. 

In 1664, the Duke of York had the King Charles II create the new colony for Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. It was named the Province of New Jersey after George Carteret; in 1649, he was Governor of the Isle of Jersey. Lord John Berkeley kept his share of New Jersey from 1664 until 1674, when he sold it to two Quakers, John Fenwick and Edward Byllynge. This due to political difficulties between him, Carteret, and Governor of New York Richard Nicolls, as well as financial difficulties. Governor Richard Nicolls had objected to the Province of New Jersey as he had exercised control over the area prior under the Province of New York. After Edward Byllynge suffered a bankruptcy and having issues with his creditors, William Penn, one of the creditors, was chosen to be arbitrator. They argued that he funded the purchase of Lord John Berkeley&#x27;s share of the Province of New Jersey with funds that were justly due to them. It was decided that Fenwick was entitled to 10% of the share, while 90% would be controlled by trustees that are chosen for the benefit of the creditors of Edward Byllynge, who were mostly Quakers themselves. The trustees were chosen to be William Penn, Gawen Laurie and Nicholas Lucas. The goal was to have the trustees sell the territory to colonists so that the creditors of Edward Byllynge would be made whole. It was also hoped that Quaker may be motivated to emigrate to this territory. At the time, the Society of Friends were flirting with the idea of &quot;new country&quot;, where they could practice their religious beliefs and not be shamelessly persecuted. In 1676, the Quakers decided to form a colony, spittling the previous colony in two, East Jersey and West Jersey for the Quakers. Quakers settled in the area at the end of the 17th century and the start of the 18th century, drawn by promises of religious freedom, fairer taxation and more representation in government.

=== Colonial (1702–1775) ===
The Quakers expansion, consumption of resources, along with the introduction of alcohol and disease, led to a decline in the Lenape population. The development of a ferry system along the Delaware River bolstered trade between Fort Nassau and Philadelphia. Through ferries, families like Coopers and the Kaighns were able to establish settlements in surrounding areas. In 1773, Jacob Cooper played a significant role in developing the area which is today known as Camden, named after Charles Pratt, the Earl of Camden.

=== Post-colonial (1776–1827) ===
Throughout the Revolutionary War, there were several skrimishes and other effects of the war felt by locals. Development was impeded for the villiage due to the revolution, as Camden was held by the British along with Philadelphia across the Delaware River.

=== Founding and early years (1828–1890) ===
In the 19th century Camden underwent significant changes, transitioning from a hub of transportation to a growing city. Camden was incorporated as a city on February 13, 1828, from portions of Newton Township, while the area was still part of Gloucester County. In 1832, Camden Township was created as a township with Camden City. The township existed until it was repealed in 1848. Camden Township was established in 1832 which was the same area as Camden City until it was reduced in 1848. In 1830, the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company was chartered in Camden, which connected ferry terminals from New York City to Philadelphia via rail. The railroad ended in Camden&#x27;s Waterfront, where passengers would be ferried across the Delaware River to arrive in Philadelphia. Similarly to Camden&#x27;s inception, transportation was a huge catalyst in its growth—the railroads opening in 1834 led to an increase in population and commerce.

=== Industrial growth (1891–1950) ===
At the turn 20th Century, industry grew rapidly at the hands of companies such as the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor), New York Shipbuilding Corporation, and Campbell Soup Company. These were major employers in Camden, at times employing tens of thousands in and outside of Camden. Its location on the Delaware River made it ideal to launch ships.

Camden also experienced dramatic shifts in its population demographic. Immigration from Eastern Europe made them the leading ethnic group by 1920, whereas it had previously been German, British, and Irish immigrants. In 1926, a bridge connected New Jersey and Pennsylvania made its debut opening, which was named the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in 1956. The project cost $37 million, which New Jersey and Pennsylvania both paid equal parts of. The goal was to reduce ferry traffic between Philadelphia and Camden. Camden Central Airport opened in 1929 (closed in 1957).

During the 1930s, Camden faced economic decline in the face of the Great Depression. It was due to Camden&#x27;s thriving industry that they did not go bankrupt. The United States role in World War II made the New York Shipbuilding Company the largest and most productive ship yard in the world. World War II caused African American migration in and around Camden from the south as there was a need for factory workers for the war effort. Subsequently, Camden became ethnically and religiously segregated. On July 17, 1951, the Delaware River Port Authority, a bi-state agency, was created to promote trade and better coordinate transportation between the two cities of Camden and Philadelphia.

=== Industrial decline (1951–1991) ===
However, by the 1950s, manufacturing came to slow causing industries to relocate and employment to dwindle. In contrast to the growth and industrialization Camden experienced in the early 1900s, there came a drop in population and industry further into the 20th century. Having reached its peak number of manufacturing jobs in 1950, by 1982 it was a quarter of what it had been. Post World War II, Campbell&#x27;s Soup Company and RCA Victor had decentralized their production efforts in Camden. This Capital Flight was an attempt to avoid an increase in labor wages which unionized workers were fighting for. The New York Shipbuilding Company, a major contributor of naval units during World War II, shut down in 1967 due to low demand and mismanagement.

During this period there was a large amount of white flight, in which white residents moved to surrounding suburbs in search of economic opportunity. Along with this, civil unrest grew resulting in riots. Police brutality and crime were at an all-time high which further exacerbated Camden&#x27;s problems.

===Revitalization (1992–present)===
Efforts to revitalize Camden began in 1980 with Mayor Randy Primas. In an attempt to generate income for the city, he pursued initiatives such as the construction of a riverfront state-prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator which received substantial opposition from residents. With Milton Milan&#x27;s election as Camden&#x27;s next mayor, he declared the city bankrupt which resulted in $60 million of aid and the state&#x27;s assumption of Camden&#x27;s finances. Another notable revitalization effort was the establishment of non-profit organization, The Parkside Business and Community In Partnership, which occurred in 1993 and is active today.
==== Redevelopment ====

Redevelopment is an idea has loomed over the city since the 1980s, when Mayor Primas started looking for projects to be able to revitalize with the loss of several foundational industries in the preciding decades. In 2013 the New Jersey Economic Development Authority introduced incentives for companies to relocate to Camden. Other projects include the redevelopment of the Waterfront, the construction of the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex, and the Subaru of America&#x27;s headquarters.

==== 2020s ====
In recent years, Camden has transitioned from a manufacturing industry to an economy focused on education and healthcare. The Eds-and-Meds Industry has become the largest source of employment in Camden—with institutions such as Cooper University Hospital, Rowan University, Rutgers-Camden, Camden County College, Virtua, Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center, and CAMcare.

== Culture ==
Camden&#x27;s role as an industrial city gave rise to distinct neighborhoods and cultural groups that have affected the growth and decline of the city over the course of the 20th century. Camden is also home to historic landmarks detailing its rich history in literature, music, social work and industry such as the Walt Whitman House, the Walt Whitman Cultural Arts Center, the Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts and the Camden Children&#x27;s Garden. Others include the Camden County Historical Society, which document the city and surrounding area&#x27;s history. It was built in 1899 as a place for those who find anything that links to one&#x27;s heritage and for other educational purposes. 

Camden&#x27;s cultural history has been greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years. From 1950 to 1970, industry plummeted, resulting in close to 20,000 jobs being lost for Camden residents. This mass unemployment as well as social pressure from neighboring townships caused an exodus of citizens, mostly white. This gap was filled by new African American and Latino citizens and led to a restructuring of Camden&#x27;s communities. The number of White citizens who left to neighboring towns such as Collingswood or Cherry Hill left both new and old African American and Latino citizens to re-shape their community. To help in this process, numerous not-for-profit organizations such as Hopeworks or the Neighborhood Center were formed to facilitate Camden&#x27;s movement into the 21st century.
=== Community ===

The Black Community has been one of the city&#x27;s foundations since its founding in 1828 and have contributed heavily to the city&#x27;s culture. Corinne&#x27;s Place is a Black-owned soul food restaurant located in Camden, New Jersey. Corinne Bradley-Powers opened the restaurant on Haddon Avenue in 1989. The Hispanic and Latino Community in the city has increased heavily in the past twenty years, but have had a long history in Camden. Puerto Rican Unity for Progress is a multi-service, community-based organization that is located in Camden and serves the Hispanic community who reside in the city. The organization was established in 1976 and opened its physical location at 437 Broadway Street in Camden in June 1978.

=== Arts and entertainment ===
The Arts and Entertainment have always been presence in the city. In the early 20th century, Camden became a hub of music and innovation in entertainment with the presence of the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). It is the birth place of celebrities such as tragic star Russ Columbo; singer and Broadway actress Lola Falana. Today, Camden is home to individuals and groups that help bulster the arts in the city.

=== Religion ===

Camden has religious institutions including many churches and their associated non-profit organizations and community centers such as the Little Rock Baptist Church in the Parkside section of Camden, First Nazarene Baptist Church, 
Kaighn Avenue Baptist Church, and the Parkside United Methodist Church. Other congregations that are active now are Newton Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, on Haddon Avenue and Cooper Street and the Masjid at 1231 Mechanic St, Camden, NJ 08104.

The first Scientology church was incorporated in December 1953 in Camden by L. Ron Hubbard, his wife Mary Sue Hubbard, and John Galusha.

Father Michael Doyle, the pastor of Sacred Heart Catholic Church located in South Camden, has played a large role in Camden&#x27;s spiritual and social history. In 1971, Doyle was part of the Camden 28, a group of anti-Vietnam War activists who planned to raid a draft board office in the city. This is noted by many as the start of Doyle&#x27;s activities as a radical &#x27;Catholic Left&#x27;. Following these activities, Monsignor Doyle went on to become the pastor of Sacred Heart Church, remaining known for his poetry and activism. Monsignor Doyle and the Sacred Heart Church&#x27;s main mission is to form a connection between the primarily white suburban surrounding areas and the inner-city of Camden.

In 1982, Father Mark Aita of Holy Name of Camden founded the St. Luke&#x27;s Catholic Medical Services. Aita, a medical doctor and a member of the Society of Jesus, created the first medical system in Camden that did not use rotating primary care physicians. Since its conception, St. Luke&#x27;s has grown to include Patient Education Classes as well as home medical services, aiding over seven thousand Camden residents.

=== Philanthropy ===

The city has long had a history of philanthropy and charity, dating back to its founding. The city&#x27;s founding families were quakers that were very interested in charitable causes like the care of orphans and helping runaway slaves. They were members of the Society of Friends whose members were the likes of William Penn. In 1865, the Society of Friends founded the Camden Home for Friendless Children. Since that home was segregated, the Society of Friends opened the West Jersey Colored Orphanage in 1874.

Camden has a variety of non-profit Tax-Exempt Organizations aimed to assist city residents with a wide range of health and social services free or reduced charge to residents. Camden City, having one of the highest rates of poverty in New Jersey, fueled residents and local organizations to develop organizations aimed to provide relief to its citizens. As of the 2000 Census, Camden&#x27;s income per capita was $9,815. This ranking made Camden the poorest city in the state of New Jersey, as well as one of the poorest cities in the United States. Camden also has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the nation.

===Urban enterprise zone===
Portions of Camden are part of a joint Urban Enterprise Zone. The city was selected in 1983 as one of the initial group of 10 zones chosen to participate in the program. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the 6.625% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in September 1988, the city&#x27;s Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in December 2023.

The UEZ program in Camden and four other original UEZ cities had been allowed to lapse as of January 1, 2017, after Governor Chris Christie, who called the program an &quot;abject failure&quot;, vetoed a compromise bill that would have extended the status for two years. In May 2018, Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that reinstated the program in these five cities and extended the expiration date in other zones.

==Geography and architecture==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 10.34 square miles (26.78 km2), including 8.92 square miles (23.10 km2) of land and 1.42 square miles (3.68 km2) of water (13.75%).

Historically, the Waterfront has always been a foundational part and major hub of the city. It was home to the New York Shipbuilding Company Shipyards until 1968. Since the 1990s, the Waterfront began a beacon of revitalization for the city. The city&#x27;s waterfront, along the Delaware River is highlighted by its three main attractions, the USS &quot;New Jersey&quot;, the Freedom Mortgage Pavilion, and the Adventure Aquarium. The waterfront is also the headquarters for Catapult Learning, the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex, American Water.

===Port===

On the Delaware River, with access to the Atlantic Ocean, the Port of Camden handles break bulk, bulk cargo, as well as some containers. Terminals fall under the auspices of the South Jersey Port Corporation as well as private operators such as Holt Logistics/Holtec International. The port receives hundreds of ships moving international and domestic cargo annually and is one of the USA&#x27;s largest shipping centers for wood products, cocoa and perishables.

===Housing===
The most common type of home in Camden is rowhouse, similar to those in the neighboring city of Philadelphia. Saint Josephs Carpenter Society (SJCS) is a non profit that has rehabilitated 500 homes throughout the city.

Camden contains the United States&#x27; first federally funded planned community for working class residents, Yorkship Village (now called Fairview). The village was designed by Electus Darwin Litchfield, who was influenced by the &quot;garden city&quot; developments popular in England at the time.

In 2013, Cherokee Investment Partners had a plan to redevelop north Camden with 5,000 new homes and a shopping center on . Cherokee dropped their plans in the face of local opposition and the slumping real estate market. They are among several companies receiving New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) tax incentives to relocate jobs in the city.

===Climate===
Camden has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) with hot summers and cool to cold winters.

==Education==
===Public schools===
Camden&#x27;s public schools are operated by the Camden City School District. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in &quot;Abbott v. Burke&quot; which are now referred to as &quot;SDA Districts&quot; based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of 19 schools, had an enrollment of 7,553 students and 668.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.3:1.

High schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Brimm Medical Arts High School (175; 9–12), 
Camden Big Picture Learning Academy (196; 6–12), 
Camden High School (347; 9–12), 
Creative Arts Academy (290; 6–12), 
Eastside High School (784; 9–12) and 
Pride Academy (63; 6–12).

=== Charter and renaissance schools ===

In 2012, The Urban Hope Act was signed into law, allowing renaissance schools to open in Trenton, Newark, and Camden. The renaissance schools, run by charter companies, differed from charter schools, as they enrolled students based on the surrounding neighborhood, similar to the city school district. This makes renaissance schools a hybrid of charter and public schools. This is the act that allowed Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP), Uncommon Schools, and Mastery Schools to open in the city.

Under the renaissance charter school proposal, the Henry L. Bonsall Family School became Uncommon Schools Camden Prep Mt. Ephraim Campus, East Camden Middle School has become part of Mastery Charter Schools, Francis X. Mc Graw Elementary School and Rafael Cordero Molina Elementary School have become part of the Mastery charter network. The J.G Whittier Family school has become part of the KIPP Public Charter Schools as KIPP Cooper Norcross Academy.
Students were given the option to stay with the school under their transition or seek other alternatives.

In the 2013–14 school year, Camden city proposed a budget of $72 million to allot to charter schools in the city. In previous years, Camden city charter schools have used $52 million and $66 million in the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 school years, respectively.

March 9, 2015, marked the first year of the new Camden Charter Schools open enrollment. Mastery and Uncommon charter schools did not meet enrollment projections for their first year of operation by 15% and 21%, according to Education Law Center.

In October 2016, Governor Chris Christie, Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd, Camden Public Schools Superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard, and state and local representatives announced a historical $133 million investment of a new Camden High School Project. The new school is planned to be ready for student occupancy in 2021. It would have 9th and 12th grade.

As of 2019, there are 3,850 Camden students enrolled in one of the city&#x27;s renaissance schools, with 4,350 Camden students are enrolled one of the city&#x27;s charter schools. Combined, these students make up approximately 55% of the 15,000 students in Camden.

The city was once home to two Carnegie libraries, the Main Building and the Cooper Library in Johnson Park. The city&#x27;s once extensive library system, beleaguered by financial difficulties, threatened to close at the end of 2010, but was incorporated into the county system. The main branch closed in February 2011, and was later reopened by the county in the bottom floor of the Paul Robeson Library at Rutgers University.

Camden also has three academic libraries; The Paul Robeson Library at Rutgers University-Camden serves Rutgers undergraduate and graduate students, as well as students from the Camden campuses of Camden County College and Rowan University. Rutgers Law School has a law library and Cooper Medical School at Rowan has a medical library.

==Sports==

=== Camden Athletic Complex ===
The Camden Athletic Complex (former site of Campbell&#x27;s Field) which was completed in 2022. it contains a baseball field, track and field area, soccer field, and lacrosse field. The Camden Riversharks were an American professional baseball team based in Camden, which played out of the former Campbell&#x27;s Field. An investment totaling $15 million, planned to be split evenly between Rutgers and the city of Camden, will reportedly develop the area into a recreational complex for the city, as well as accommodations for the university&#x27;s NCAA Division III sports teams.

=== Philadelphia 76ers training facility ===

The team found a property at the Camden Waterfront. An $82 million grant was approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to begin construction of the training facility in Camden, and was scheduled to break ground in October 2014. The grant was somewhat controversial in that it saves the 76ers organization from paying any property taxes or fees that would be accrued by the building over its first decade. Vocal opponents of the facility claim that the site has now joined a list of large companies or industries that are invited to Camden with significant monetary incentive, at great expense to local tax payers as a form of corporate welfare. Based on contingent hiring, the grant was to be paid out over 10 years, with the facility scheduled to host practices by 2016. The training facilities include the two full-size courts, as well as a weight room, full hydrotherapy room, Gatorade Fuel Bar, full players-only restaurant and personal chef, medical facilities, film room, and full locker room.

==Government and services==
Since July 1, 1961, the city has operated within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under a Mayor-Council form of government. Since 1994, the city has been divided into four council districts, with a single council member elected from each of the four districts and three council members being elected at-large; previously, the entire council was elected at-large.

, the Mayor of Camden is Democrat Victor Carstarphen, whose term of office ends December 31, 2025.

Collins (D, 2027; Ward 2), Falio Leyba-Martinez (D, 2027; Ward 3), Jannette Ramos (D, 2027; Ward 4) and Noemi G. Soria-Perez (D, 2025; at large).

It was home to the Norcross brothers, three brothers who have dominated Southern Jersey democratic politics for the past 25 years, until legal troubles in 2024 led them to take a backseat. The city has had its struggles with corruption throughout its political history. Three Camden mayors have been jailed for corruption: Angelo Errichetti, Arnold Webster, and Milton Milan.

This city is on to something, no one is suggesting that the job is done,&quot; the president said. &quot;It&#x27;s still a work in progress.&quot; In the 2012 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama was seeking reelection and was challenged by Mitt Romney. The city overwhelmingly voted for Obama in the biggest Democratic landslide in Camden&#x27;s history.

=== Camden Fire Department (CFD) ===
Officially organized in 1869, the Camden Fire Department (CFD) is the oldest paid fire department in New Jersey and is among the oldest paid fire departments in the United States. The Camden Fire Department currently operates out of five fire stations, organized into two battalions. Each battalion is commanded by a battalion chief, who in turn reports to a deputy chief. The CFD currently operates five engine companies, one squad (rescue-pumper), three ladder companies, and one rescue company, as well as several other special, support, and reserve units. The department&#x27;s fireboat is docked on the Delaware River. Since 2010, the Camden Fire Department has suffered severe economic cutbacks, including company closures and staffing cuts. 

=== Camden County Police Department (CCPD) ===
On May 1, 2013, Camden Police Department was disbanded due to a union contract that made it financially impossible to keep officers on the street. The Camden County Police Department was formed to succeed the Camden Police Department. Camden County&#x27;s Police Department brought in 25 new officers to train in neighborhoods in hopes they could regain the trust of local communities. Because of the reorganized force in 2013, the number of cops in the streets has increased, and spread throughout Camden. Camden&#x27;s new police force began patrolling in tandem, speaking with residents, and driving patrol cars. A &quot;CNN&quot; report proposed that Camden might be a national model for what police abolition or &quot;defunding the police&quot; could look like.

==== Crime ====
Camden once had a national reputation for its violent crime rates, when there were a record 67 homicides in the city. On October 29, 2012, the FBI announced Camden was ranked first in violent crime per capita of cities with over 50,000 residents. Recent years have seen a significant drop in violent crime, with 2017 seeing the lowest number of homicides in three decades, 23 murders, half as many as the 44 murders the previous year. Morgan Quitno has ranked Camden as one of the top ten most dangerous cities in the United States since 1998, when they first included cities with populations less than 100,000.

Total violent crime in the city declined in 2022, despite 28 murders and a spike of 29% in non-violent crime, highlighted by a sharp increase in car-related crime.

==Transportation==
===Public transportation===
The Walter Rand Transportation Center opened May 17, 1989 under the name of Camden Transportation Center and was later named after a former New Jersey State senator, Walter Rand in 1994. The surface level bus transfer center located on the corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Broadway, includes both indoor and outdoor stations and runs between the hours of 6am and 9:30pm, seven days a week. A majority of buses that stop at the center are NJ Transit buses that provide inexpensive and quick transportation to Philadelphia, Camden and Burlington Counties surrounding cities. The different routes include 313, 315, 316, 317, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 412, 413, 418, 419, 450, 451, 452, 453, 457 and 551. Depending on distance and route the bus fare varies from under a dollar for closer stops, up to fifty dollars for farther stations including Philadelphia and Atlantic City. Along with the NJ Transit buses, the center is also home to many Greyhound Lines, that provide transportation to neighboring cities as well as to much farther destinations all around the country. Like the NJ Transit buses, the Greyhound bus fares vary from inexpensive for closer destinations and much more expensive for the farther the destination. Along with the bus stops, the center is home to two rail road system stations, the Walter Rand River Line station and PATCO, Broadway station which provides easy access to the busses from the surrounding area.

Since its opening on March 14, 2004, NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line has offered light rail service to cities along the Delaware River starting in North Camden, and terminating in Trenton. There are four total stations located in the city, the southern most station is located at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion located on the Delaware River, and goes north along the river up to Trenton. The second and third most south stations in Camden stop at the Camden Adventure Aquarium and at Rutgers University. The last stop in the city, the Walter Rand Transportation Center, located on Martin Luther King Boulevard and Broadway, is a major transportation hub where the PATCO, NJ Transit buses, and Greyhounds all meet. Since its opening the River Line was running 24-hours a day, but switched in 2010 to no service after 10pm. Fares are priced at $1.70 and are stamped by an employee when boarding the train and fare evasion carries a fine of up to $100. Along with physical tickets that can be purchased at each station, online tickets can be purchased through smart phones on the NJ Transit App. The River Line was the first railroad to use a diesel LRV vehicle. Using diesel LRV vehicles made it cheaper to run and much easier to start and stop because of the frequent stations and cross roads that the rail stops for. Since the start of this type of transit multiple other cities have started to use it as well, including Austin, Texas.

The PATCO Speedline offers frequent train service to Philadelphia and the suburbs to the east in Camden County, including Camden, Collingswood, Haddon Township, Haddonfield, Cherry Hill, Voorhees, and Lindenwold. Throughout the two states there are a total of 13 stations. Unlike most major US transit systems, the PACTO Speedline is running 24-hours a day. Opening in 1926 under the name of The Delaware River Bridge Commission, the rail consisted of 6 Philadelphia stops, and only two Camden stops, City Hall, and Broadway station. In 1951 Pennsylvania and New Jersey signed a contract allowing the expansion of the railroad. These expansions included station between Camden and Lindenwold. Unlike the River Line the PATCO uses automated fare collection. The first station after crossing the river into Philadelphia, Franklin Square closed in 1979 because of the low number of riders. The station was proposed for a remodel and is planned on opening during the summer of 2024. From 1969 to 2006 the system used plastic tickets which had an oxide layer on the entire back side used for magnetic encoding. Starting in 2006 the use of contactless paper tickets with a much smaller magnetic strip made the production and storage of tickets much cheaper and wasteful. Along with the paper tickets frequent rides could buy a plastic reusable card that could be refilled and also provide discounts on both fairs and specifics store near each station. Stations outside of the cities including Ferry ave, Collingswood, Vestment, Haddonfield, Woodcrest, Ashland, and Lindenwold, provide free day time parking and one dollar overnight parking, while the stations in the cities do not have access to parking.

The RiverLink Ferry opened March 1992, as a passenger ferry service that crossed the Delaware River connecting the Camden Water Front with Philadelphia&#x27;s, Penn&#x27;s Landing. The ferry operates daily from May through September, and on Fridays through Sundays in April and October. Docking at Wiggins Park, located between the Adventure Aquarium and the Battleship New Jersey, the ferry provides access to the Adventure Aquarium, Battleship New Jersey, Camden&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Garden, and the Freedom Mortgage Pavilion. On the Philadelphia side of the river the ferry docks at the Independence Seaport Museum, and provides access to the many attractions located at Penns Landing, including multiple city piers, and restaurants as well as Museums, the battle ship Olympia, and the submarine Becuna. Penn&#x27;s Landing opened up the opportunity to exploring the historical section of Center City Philadelphia including Independence Hall, and City Hall. Round trip ticket prices range from $8 for children and seniors to $10 for adults while children under the age of four ride for free.

The RiverLink Ferry was not the first ferry to call Camden home. Since the start of the United States there has been a need to transport goods and people across the Delaware. Before the construction of the Ben Franklin Bridge there were multiple ferries that launched from Camdens waterfront including on Market street, and Vine street located in the downtown area, as well as Kaighn ave located in South Camden. During the winter when the river had frozen horse were used to tow the ferries across like sleds, which helped slow the number of injuries and death that occurred from individuals that walked across the ice. On one occasion the fire started aboard one of the ferries. On March 15, 1856, the Delaware was full of floating chucks of ice rushing through the ruff current when flames burst out along the upper deck. People on board did their best to calm the fire with buckets of freezing water but resorted to jumping over board. As a result, over sixty people died in the accident with countless missing while only 30 made it out alive. Between the years of 1727 and 1766 more than 800 slaves were brought by 3 different ferries and sold in Downtown, Camden. Today there are historical signs placed at these three sites to commemorate the people sold there.

===Roads and highways===
, the city had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Camden County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the Delaware River Port Authority.

Interstate 676 and U.S. Route 30 run through Camden to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge on the north side of the city. Interstate 76 passes through briefly and interchanges with Interstate 676.

Route 168 passes through briefly in the south and County Routes 537, 543, 551 and 561 all travel through the center of the city.
== Environmental problems ==

Over the past few decades, Camden has faced many environmental problems due to its history of heavy industry and the improper disposal of contaminants. Environmental concerns include air/water pollution and soil contamination. There are several Superfund sites throughout the city. In recent years, illegal dumping has become an issue due to the large number of vacant lots throughout the city and a lack of security and maintenance.

<text>MAME (formerly an acronym of Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) is a free and open-source emulator designed to recreate the hardware of arcade games, video game consoles, old computers and other systems in software on modern personal computers and other platforms. Its intention is to preserve gaming history by preventing vintage video games from being lost or forgotten. It does this by emulating the inner workings of the emulated machines; the ability to actually play the video games is considered &quot;a nice side effect&quot;. &quot;Joystiq&quot; has listed MAME as an application that every Windows and Mac gamer should have.

The first public MAME release was by Nicola Salmoria on 5 February 1997. It now supports over 7,000 unique games and 10,000 actual ROM image sets, though not all of the games are playable. MESS, an emulator for many video game consoles and computer systems, based on the MAME core, was integrated into MAME in 2015.

With OTVDM (WineVDM) a version of MAME is available to emulate 16-Bit DOS and Windows applications on x64 and AArch64 versions of Windows. The NTVDM from Microsoft is only supported for the 32-bit versions of Windows.

== History and overview ==
The MAME project was started by Italian programmer Nicola Salmoria. It began as a project called Multi-Pac, intended to preserve video games in the Pac-Man family, but the name was changed as more games were added to its framework. The first MAME version was released in 1996. In April 1997, Salmoria stepped down for his national service commitments, handing stewardship of the project to fellow Italian Mirko Buffoni for half a year. In May 2003, David Haywood took over as project coordinator; and from April 2005 to April 2011, the project was coordinated by Aaron Giles; then Angelo Salese stepped in as the coordinator; and in 2012, Miodrag Milanovic took over. The project is supported by hundreds of developers around the world and thousands of outside contributors.

At first, MAME was developed exclusively for MS-DOS, but it was soon ported to Unix-like systems (X/MAME), Macintosh (MacMAME and later MAME OS X) and Windows (MAME32). Since 24 May 2001, with version 0.37b15, MAME&#x27;s main development has occurred on the Windows platform, and most other platforms are supported through the SDLMAME project, which was integrated into the main development source tree in 2006. MAME has also been ported to other computers, game consoles, mobile phones and PDAs and, at one point, even to digital cameras. In 2012, Google ported MAME to Native Client, which allows MAME to run inside Chrome.

Major releases of MAME occur approximately once a month. Windows executables in both 32-bit and 64-bit fashion are released on the development team&#x27;s official website, along with the complete source code. Smaller, incremental &quot;u&quot; (for update) releases were released weekly (until version 0.149u1) as source diffs against the most recent major version, to keep code in synchronization among developers. MAME&#x27;s source code is developed on a public GitHub repository, allowing those with the required expertise and tools to build the most up-to-date version and contribute enhancements as pull requests. Historical version numbers 0.32, and 0.38 through 0.52 inclusively, do not exist; the former was skipped due to similar naming of the GUI-equipped MAME32 variant (which itself has since been renamed MAMEUI due to the move to 64-bit builds), while the latter numbers were skipped due to the numerous releases in the 0.37 beta cycle (these version numbers have since been marked next to their equivalent 0.37 beta releases on the official MAMEdev website).

MAME&#x27;s architecture has been extensively improved over the years. Support for both raster and vector displays, multiple CPUs, and sound chips were added in the project&#x27;s first six months. A flexible timer system to coordinate synchronization between multiple emulated CPU cores was implemented, and ROM images started to be loaded according to their CRC32 hash in the ZIP files they were stored in. MAME has pioneered the reverse engineering of many undocumented system architectures, various CPUs (such as the M6809-derivative custom Konami CPU with new instructions) and sound chips (for example, Yamaha FM sound chips). MAME developers have been instrumental in reverse engineering many proprietary encryption algorithms utilized in arcade games, including Neo Geo, CP System II and CP System III.

MAME&#x27;s popularity has gone mainstream, with enthusiasts building their own arcade game cabinets to replay old games and even some companies producing illegal MAME derivatives to be installed in arcades. Cabinets are built either from scratch or by taking apart and modifying an original arcade game cabinet. Cabinets inspired by classic games can also be purchased and assembled (with MAME optionally preinstalled).

Although MAME contains a rudimentary user interface, the use of MAME in arcade game cabinets and home theaters necessitates special launcher applications called &quot;front ends&quot; with more advanced features. They provide varying degrees of customization, allowing one to see images of games&#x27; cabinets, histories, playing tips, specialized logo artwork for games, and video of the game&#x27;s play or &quot;attract mode&quot;.

The information within MAME is free for reuse, and companies have been known to utilize MAME when recreating their old classics on modern systems. Some have even hired MAME developers to create emulators for their old properties. An example is the &quot;Taito Legends&quot; pack, with ROMs readable on select versions of MAME.

On 27 May 2015 (0.162), the games console and computer system emulator MESS was integrated with MAME (so the MESS User Manual is still the most important usage instruction for the non-arcade parts of MAME). This also led to the removal of the acronym, as MAME can now emulate more than arcade machines. Since 2012, MAME has been maintained by former MESS project leader Miodrag Milanović.

In May 2015, it was announced that MAME&#x27;s developers planned to re-license the software under a more common free and open-source license, away from the original MAME license. MAME developer Miodrag Milanovic explained that the change was to draw more developer interest, allow game manufacturers to distribute MAME to emulate their own games, and to make the software &quot;a learning tool for developers working on development boards&quot;. The transition of MAME&#x27;s licensing to BSD/GPL was completed in March 2016. Most of MAME&#x27;s source code (90%+) is now available under the BSD-3-Clause license, and the complete project is under the GPL-2.0-or-later license.

On 24 February 2016 (0.171), MAME embedded the MEWUI front-end (and its developer joined the team), providing MAME with a flexible and more full-featured UI.

On 30 December 2021, exA-Arcadia, the Western copyright holders of the games &quot;Akai Katana&quot; and &quot;DoDonPachi SaiDaiOuJou&quot; had their lawyers file a cease and desist notice to the MAME developers over those games being included in the emulator. MAME complied with the request a day later, making both unplayable on the emulator outside of command line, as of version 0.240.

== Design ==

The MAME core coordinates the emulation of several elements at the same time. These elements replicate the behavior of the hardware present in the original machines. MAME can emulate many different central processing units (CPUs) and associated hardware. These elements are virtualized so that MAME acts as a software layer between the original program of the game, and the platform MAME runs on. MAME supports arbitrary screen resolutions, refresh rates and display configurations. Multiple emulated monitors, as required by, for example, &quot;Darius&quot;, are supported as well.

Individual systems are specified by &quot;drivers&quot; which take the form of C preprocessor macros. These drivers specify the individual components to be emulated and how they communicate with each other. While MAME was originally written in C, the need for object oriented programming caused the development team to begin to compile all code as C++ for MAME 0.136, taking advantage of additional features of that language in the process.

Although a great majority of the CPU emulation cores are interpretive, MAME also supports dynamic recompilation through an intermediate language called the Universal Machine Language (UML) to increase the emulation speed. Back-end targets supported are x86 and x64. A C back end is also available to further aid verification of the correctness. CPUs emulated in this manner are SH-2, MIPS R3000 and PowerPC.

=== ROM data ===

The original program code, graphics and sound data need to be present so that the system can be emulated. In most machines, the data is stored in read-only memory chips (ROMs), although other devices such as cassette tapes, floppy disks, hard disks, laserdiscs, and compact discs are also used. The contents of most of these devices can be copied to computer files, in a process called &quot;dumping&quot;. The resulting files are often generically called ROM images or ROMs regardless of the kind of storage they came from. A game usually consists of multiple ROM and PAL images; these are collectively stored inside a single ZIP file, constituting a &quot;ROM set&quot;. In addition to the &quot;parent&quot; ROM set (usually chosen as the most recent &quot;World&quot; version of the game), games may have &quot;clone&quot; ROM sets with different program code, different language text intended for different markets etc. For example, &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; is considered a variant of &quot;Street Fighter II Champion Edition&quot;. System boards like the Neo Geo that have ROMs shared between multiple games require the ROMs to be stored in &quot;BIOS&quot; ROM sets and named appropriately.

MAME ROMs come in three forms, &quot;split&quot;, &quot;non-merged&quot;, and &quot;merged&quot;:

* A &quot;split&quot; ROM only contains information about itself. For example, a &quot;clone&quot; ROM does not have the necessary data the &quot;parent&quot; ROM has, and a &quot;parent&quot; ROM will not contain its clones.
* A &quot;non-merged&quot; set is a ROM that has everything a program needs to run in one ZIP file, such as its &quot;parent&quot;. Non-merged ROMs take up more space due to redundancy, but they are useful for cases where only a specific set of programs are desired, such as only desiring one specific version of a game without desiring to also obtain the other required files.
* A &quot;merged&quot; set is a ROM that contains the &quot;parent&quot; ROM and its &quot;clones&quot; in one package. For example, a merged &quot;Pac-Man&quot; ROM would contain the &quot;parent&quot; Japanese &quot;Puck-Man&quot; ROM, the Midway USA &quot;Pac-Man&quot; version, and all other clone or bootleg versions of the game. It is more space-efficient than a split set. 

Hard disks, compact discs and laserdiscs are stored in a MAME-specific format called CHD (Compressed Hunks of Data). Some machines use analog hardware, such as laserdiscs, to store and play back audio/video data such as soundtracks and cinematics. This data must be captured and encoded into digital files that can be read by MAME. MAME does not support the use of external analog devices, which (along with identical speaker and speaker enclosures) would be required for a 100% faithful reproduction of the experience. An ever decreasing number of games with unemulated audio circuits require sound samples in WAV file format for sound emulation. MAME additionally supports artwork files in PNG format for bezel and overlay graphics. Furthermore, emulation of games with liquid-crystal displays such as Game &amp; Watch or extra physical aspects such as slot machines usually require extra image files for backgrounds or other aspects of the games.

== Philosophy, accuracy and quality ==
The stated aim of the project is to document hardware, and so MAME takes a somewhat purist view of emulation, prohibiting programming hacks that might make a game easier to run at the expense of emulation accuracy. Components such as CPUs are emulated at a low level (meaning individual instructions are emulated) whenever possible, and high-level emulation (HLE) is only used when a chip is completely undocumented and cannot be reverse-engineered in detail. Signal level emulation is used to emulate audio circuitry that consists of analog components.

MAME emulates well over a thousand different arcade system boards, a majority of which are completely undocumented and custom designed to run either a single game or a very small number of them. The approach MAME takes with regards to accuracy is an incremental one; systems are emulated as accurately as they reasonably can be. Bootleg copies of games are often the first to be emulated, with proper (and copy protected) versions emulated later. Besides encryption, arcade games were usually protected with custom microcontroller units (MCUs) that implemented a part of the game logic or some other important functions. Emulation of these chips is preferred even when they have little or no immediately visible effect on the game itself. For example, the monster behavior in Bubble Bobble was not perfected until the code and data contained with the custom MCU was dumped through the decapping of the chip. This results in the ROM set requirements changing as the games are emulated to a more and more accurate degree, causing older versions of the ROM set becoming unusable in newer versions of MAME.

Portability and generality are also important to MAME. Combined with the uncompromising stance on accuracy, this often results in high system requirements. Although a 2 GHz processor is enough to run almost all 2D games, more recent systems and particularly systems with 3D graphics can be unplayably slow, even on the fastest computers. MAME does not currently take advantage of hardware acceleration to speed up the rendering of 3D graphics, in part because of the lack of a stable cross-platform 3D API, and in part because software rendering can, in theory, be an exact reproduction of the various custom 3D rendering approaches that were used in the arcade games.

== Legal status ==

Owning and distributing MAME itself is legal in most countries, as it is merely an emulator. Companies such as Sony have attempted in court to prevent other software such as Virtual Game Station, a Sony PlayStation emulator from being sold, but they have been ultimately unsuccessful. MAME itself has thus far not been the subject of any court cases.

Most games are still covered by copyright. Downloading or distributing copyrighted ROMs without permission from copyright holders is almost always a violation of copyright laws. However, some countries (including the US) allow the owner of a board to transfer data contained in its ROM chips to a personal computer or other device they own. Some copyright holders have explored making ROMs available to the public through licensing. For example, in 2003 Atari made MAME-compatible ROMs for 27 of its arcade games available on the Internet site &quot;Star ROMs&quot;. However, by 2006 the ROMs were no longer being sold there. At one point, various Capcom games were sold with the HotRod arcade joystick manufactured by Hanaho, but this arrangement was discontinued as well. Other copyright holders have released games which are no longer commercially viable free of charge to the public under licenses that prohibit commercial use of the games. Many of these games may be downloaded legally from the official MAME web site. The Spanish arcade game developer Gaelco has also released &quot;World Rally&quot; for non-commercial use on their website.

The MAME community has distanced itself from other groups redistributing ROMs via the Internet or physical media, claiming they are blatantly infringing copyright and harm the project by potentially bringing it into disrepute. Despite this, illegal distributions of ROMs are widespread on the Internet, and many &quot;Full Sets&quot; also exist which contains a full collection of a specific version&#x27;s ROMs. In addition, many bootleg game systems, such as arcade multi carts, often use versions of MAME to run their games.

== Original MAME license ==

MAME was formerly distributed under a custom self-written copyleft license, called the &quot;MAME license&quot; or the &quot;MAME-like license&quot;, which was adopted also by other projects, e.g. Visual Pinball. This license ensures the availability of the licensed program&#x27;s source code, whilst the redistribution of the program in commercial activities is prohibited. Due to this clause, the license is incompatible with the OSI&#x27;s Open Source Definition and the FSF&#x27;s Free Software Definition, and as such is not considered an open source, or free software license, respectively. The non-commercial clause was designed to prevent arcade operators from installing MAME cabinets and profiting from the works of the original manufacturers of the games. The ambiguity of the definition &quot;commercial&quot; led to legal problems with the license.

Since March 2016 with version 0.172, MAME itself switched, by dual licensing, to common free software licenses, the BSD-3-Clause license, and the GPL-2.0-or-later license. However, old versions remain licensed under the original license.

<text>A photoresistor (also known as a light-dependent resistor, LDR, or photo-conductive cell) is a passive component that decreases in resistance as a result of increasing luminosity (light) on its sensitive surface, in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photoresistor can be used in light-sensitive detector circuits and light-activated and dark-activated switching circuits acting as a semiconductor resistance. In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megaohms (MΩ), while in the light, it can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on a photoresistor exceeds a certain frequency, photons absorbed by the semiconductor give bound electrons enough energy to jump into the conduction band. The resulting free electrons (and their hole partners) conduct electricity, thereby lowering resistance. The resistance range and sensitivity of a photoresistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photoresistors may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands.

A photoelectric device can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. An intrinsic semiconductor has its own charge carriers and is not an efficient semiconductor (such as silicon is). In intrinsic devices, most of the available electrons are in the valence band, and hence the photon must have enough energy to excite the electron across the entire bandgap. Extrinsic devices have impurities, also called dopants, added whose ground state energy is closer to the conduction band; since the electrons do not have as far to jump, lower energy photons (that is, longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) are sufficient to trigger the device. If a sample of silicon has some of its atoms replaced by phosphorus atoms (impurities), there will be extra electrons available for conduction. This is an example of an extrinsic semiconductor.

==Design considerations==
A photoresistor is less light-sensitive than a photodiode or a phototransistor. The latter two components are true semiconductor devices, while a photoresistor is a passive component that does not have a PN-junction. The photoresistivity of any photoresistor may vary widely depending on ambient temperature, making them unsuitable for applications requiring precise measurement of or sensitivity to light photons.

Photoresistors also exhibit a certain degree of latency between exposure to light and the subsequent decrease in resistance, usually around 10 milliseconds. The lag time when going from lit to dark environments is even greater, often as long as one second. This property makes them unsuitable for sensing rapidly flashing lights, but is sometimes used to smooth the response of audio signal compression.

==Applications==
Photoresistors come in many types. Inexpensive cadmium sulfide (CdS) cells can be found in many consumer items such as camera light meters, clock radios, alarm devices (as the detector for a light beam), nightlights, outdoor clocks, solar street lamps, and solar road studs, etc.

Photoresistors can be placed in streetlights to control when the light is on. Ambient light falling on the photoresistor causes the streetlight to turn off. Thus energy is saved by ensuring the light is only on during hours of darkness.

Photoresistors are also used in laser-based security systems to detect the change in the light intensity when a person or object passes through the laser beam.

They are also used in some dynamic compressors together with a small incandescent or neon lamp, or light-emitting diode to control gain reduction. A common usage of this application can be found in many guitar amplifiers that incorporate an onboard tremolo effect, as the oscillating light patterns control the level of signal running through the amplifier circuit.

The use of CdS and CdSe photoresistors is severely restricted in Europe due to the RoHS ban on cadmium.

Lead sulfide (PbS) and indium antimonide (InSb) LDRs (light-dependent resistors) are used for the mid-infrared spectral region. Ge:Cu photoconductors are among the best far-infrared detectors available, and are used for infrared astronomy and infrared spectroscopy.

<text>The Commissioners for the Discovery of the Longitude at Sea, or more popularly Board of Longitude, was a British government body formed in 1714 to administer a scheme of prizes intended to encourage innovators to solve the problem of finding longitude at sea.

==Origins==
Navigators and scientists had been working on the problem of not knowing a ship&#x27;s longitude. The establishment of the Board of Longitude was motivated by this problem and by the 1707 grounding of four ships of Vice-Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell&#x27;s fleet off the Isles of Scilly, resulting in heavy loss of life. Established by Queen Anne the Longitude Act 1714 named 24 Commissioners of Longitude, key figures from politics, the Navy, astronomy and mathematics. However, the Board did not meet until at least 1737 when interest grew in John Harrison&#x27;s marine timekeeper.

The Board administered prizes for those who could demonstrate a working device or method. The main longitude prizes were:
*£10,000 for a method that could determine longitude within (£ as of )
*£15,000 for a method that could determine longitude within (£ as of )
*£20,000 for a method that could determine longitude within (£ as of ).

In addition, the Board had the discretion to make awards to persons who were making significant contributions to the effort or to provide financial support to those who were working towards a solution. The Board could also make advances of up to £2,000 for experimental work deemed promising. Under this heading, the Board made many lesser awards, including some awards in total £5,000 made to John Harrison before he received his main prize, an award of £3,000 to the widow of Tobias Mayer, whose lunar tables were the basis of the lunar data in the early decades of &quot;The Nautical Almanac&quot;, £300 to Leonhard Euler for his (assumed) contribution to the work of Mayer, £50 each to Richard Dunthorne and Israel Lyons for contributing methods to shorten the calculations connected with lunar distances, and awards made to the designers of improvements in chronometers.

Even though many tried their hand at winning the main prize, for decades none was able to come up with a practical solution to the problem. The Board recognised that any serious attempt would be based on the recognition that the earth rotates through 15° of longitude every hour. The comparison of local time between a reference place (e.g., Greenwich) and the local time of the place in question would determine the longitude of that place. Since local apparent time could be determined with some ease, the problem centred on finding a means of determining (or in the case of chronometers, keeping) the time of the reference place when one is far away from it.

For details of the efforts towards determining the longitude, see History of longitude.

==End of the board&#x27;s mandate==
For many decades a sufficiently accurate chronometer was prohibitively expensive. The lunar distance method was used by mariners either in conjunction with or instead of the marine chronometer. However, with the expectation that accurate clocks would eventually become commonplace, John Harrison showed that his method was the way of the future. However, the board never awarded the prize to Harrison, nor anyone else.

With the significant problems considered as solved, the Board of Longitude was abolished by Act of Parliament in 1828 and replaced by a Resident Committee for Scientific Advice for the Admiralty consisting of three scientific advisors: Thomas Young, Michael Faraday and Edward Sabine.

<text>Dodger Stadium is a ballpark in the Elysian Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. It is the home of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Opened in 1962, it was constructed in less than three years at a cost of (US$ in ). It is the oldest ballpark in MLB west of the Mississippi River, and third-oldest overall, after Fenway Park in Boston (1912) and Wrigley Field in Chicago (1914), and is the largest baseball stadium in the world by seat capacity. Often referred to as a &quot;pitcher&#x27;s ballpark&quot;, the stadium has seen 13 no-hitters, 2 of which were perfect games.

The stadium hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1980 and 2022, as well as the World Series eleven times (1963, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988, 2017, 2018, and 2024). It also hosted the semifinals and finals of the 2009 and 2017 World Baseball Classics, as well as exhibition baseball during the 1984 Summer Olympics. The stadium hosted a soccer tournament on August 3, 2013, featuring four clubs: the hometown team Los Angeles Galaxy, and Europe&#x27;s Real Madrid, Everton, and Juventus. The Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks played a regular season game in 2014 as part of the NHL Stadium Series. The stadium was also the home of the Los Angeles Angels from 1962 through 1965.

The stadium is commonly referred to as Chavez Ravine Stadium (or just &quot;Chavez Ravine&quot;), after the geographic feature in which the stadium sits. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Blue Heaven on Earth,&quot; a nickname coined by Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda.

==History==

===Construction===
In the mid-1950s, Brooklyn Dodgers team president Walter O&#x27;Malley had tried to build a domed stadium in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, but was unable to reach an agreement with city officials for the land acquisition, and eventually reached a deal with the city of Los Angeles. The land that would be used for Dodger Stadium had previously been seized from local owners and inhabitants by the city of Los Angeles, using eminent domain with funds from the federal Housing Act of 1949. The city had planned to develop the Elysian Park Heights public housing project, which included two dozen 13-story buildings and more than 160 two-story townhouses, in addition to newly rebuilt playgrounds and schools, and a college.

Before construction could begin on the housing project, the local political climate changed greatly when Norris Poulson was elected mayor of Los Angeles in 1953. Proposed public housing projects such as Elysian Park Heights lost most of their support as they became associated with socialist ideals. Following protracted negotiations, the city purchased the Chavez Ravine property back from the Federal Housing Authority at a drastically reduced price, with the stipulation that the land be used for a public purpose. It was not until June 3, 1958, when Los Angeles voters approved a &quot;Taxpayers Committee for Yes on Baseball&quot; referendum, that the Dodgers were able to acquire of Chavez Ravine from the city. Los Angeles forcefully evicted residents from their homes, mainly Hispanics. While Dodger Stadium was under construction, the Dodgers played in the league&#x27;s largest capacity venue from 1958 through 1961 at their temporary home, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which could seat in excess of 90,000 people.

Los Angeles–based Mike Davis, in his seminal work on the city, &quot;City of Quartz&quot;, describes the process of gradually convincing Chavez Ravine homeowners to sell. With nearly all of the original Spanish-speaking homeowners initially unwilling to sell, developers resorted to offering immediate cash payments, distributed through their Spanish-speaking agents. Once the first sales had been completed, remaining homeowners were offered increasingly lesser amounts of money, to create a community panic of not receiving fair compensation, or of being left as one of the few holdouts. Many residents continued to hold out despite the pressure being placed upon them by developers, resulting in the Battle of Chavez Ravine, a ten-year struggle by the residents to maintain control of their property, which they ultimately lost.

Dodger Stadium was the first Major League Baseball stadium since the initial construction of the original Yankee Stadium to be built using 100% private financing, and the last until Oracle Park in San Francisco opened in 2000. Ground was broken for Dodger Stadium on September 17, 1959. The tops of local ridges were removed, and the soil was used to fill in Sulfur and Cemetery Ravines to provide a level surface for a parking lot and the stadium. A local elementary school (Palo Verde) was simply buried rather than demolished, and sits beneath the parking lot northwest of third base. A total of of earth were moved in the process of building the stadium. A total of 21,000 precast concrete units, some weighing as much as 32 tons, were fabricated onsite and lowered into place with a specially built crane to form the stadium&#x27;s structural framework. The stadium was originally designed to be expandable to 85,000 seats by expanding the upper decks over the outfield pavilions; the Dodgers have never pursued such a project.

===Frank McCourt era===
At the conclusion of the 2005 season, the Los Angeles Dodgers made major renovations during the subsequent off-season.

The largest of these improvements was the replacement of nearly all the seats in the stadium. The seats that were removed had been in use since 1975 and helped give the stadium its unique &quot;space age&quot; feel with a color palette of bright yellow, orange, blue, and red. The new seats are in the original (more muted) 1962 color scheme consisting of yellow, light orange, turquoise, and sky blue. 2,000 pairs of seats were made available for purchase at $250, with the proceeds going to charity.

The baseline seating sections have been converted into retro-style &quot;box&quot; seating, adding leg room and a table. Other repairs were made to the concrete structure of the stadium. These improvements mark the second phase of a multi-year improvement plan for Dodger Stadium.

===Renovations===
Between 2003 and 2005, Dodger Stadium upgraded with LED video displays. The large main video display measures high by wide.

In 2008, the Dodgers announced a $412 million project to build a Dodger museum, shops, and restaurants around Dodger Stadium. In a press release, the team described the various features of the renovation as follows:
*Dodger Way – A tree-lined entrance will lead to a landscaped grand plaza where fans can gather beyond center field. The plaza will connect to a promenade that features restaurants, shops and the Dodger Experience museum showcasing the history of the Dodgers in an interactive setting.
*Green Necklace – The vibrant street setting of Dodger Way links to a beautiful perimeter around Dodger Stadium, enabling fans to walk around the park, outdoors yet inside the stadium gates. This Green Necklace will transform acres of parking lots into a landscaped outdoor walkway connecting the plaza and promenade to the rest of the ballpark.
*Top of the Park – The Green Necklace connects to a large scale outdoor plaza featuring breathtaking 360° views spanning the downtown skyline and Santa Monica Bay, the Santa Monica and San Gabriel Mountains, and the Dodger Stadium diamond.

In the 2008–2009 off-season, the upper levels of the stadium were supposed to be renovated to match the repairs and improvements made to the field level. The improvements were to include the removal of the trough urinals in the men&#x27;s restrooms, new concession stands and earthquake retrofitting to the concrete structure. It was also to include the replacement of the outfield scoreboards and monitors with new HD monitors. Due to the 2009 World Baseball Classic hosted at Dodger Stadium, these renovations were put on hold. The divorce of Frank and Jamie McCourt, as well as a weak economy, were the reasons for the postponement.

To pay for an outstanding loan with the Dodgers former owner News Corporation, former owner Frank McCourt used Dodger Stadium as collateral to obtain a $250 million loan.

In 2008, the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to give the Dodger Stadium area bounded by Academy Rd, Lookout Dr. and Stadium Way its own zip code, 90090 (as of July 2009). This also gives the area a new name, Dodgertown. The signs from the former Dodgertown spring training facility in Vero Beach, Florida will likely be integrated into the $500 million project.

===New ownership and further renovation===
Following the sale of the Dodgers in 2012, the team brought in the architect, urban planner, and stadium specialist Janet Marie Smith to lead renovations efforts to the 50-year-old stadium. Renovations to Dodger Stadium began in the winter of 2012. Both video boards were replaced with High Definition screens, and new clubhouses and weight rooms were installed. The restrooms, concession stands, sound system and batting cages were also improved and renovated.

Dodgers owner Guggenheim Partners internally discussed moving the Dodgers to a new stadium at a Downtown Los Angeles site proposed by the Anschutz Entertainment Group to allow an NFL team to build a stadium at the Dodger Stadium site. Guggenheim Partners also considered allowing an NFL team to build a stadium next to Dodger Stadium. The NFL eventually chose to build SoFi Stadium in the City of Inglewood.

The extensive renovations to Dodger Stadium were ready for the 2013 season and included new HD hexagonal video and scoreboards, a new sound system, wider concourses, more standing room viewing areas, improved restrooms and a children&#x27;s playground amongst others.

Between the 2013 and 2014 seasons, more renovations were put in place. Dodger Stadium was the beneficiary of improvements such as wider concourses in the pavilions, new restaurants &quot;Think Blue Bar-B-Que&quot; and &quot;Tommy Lasorda&#x27;s Trattoria&quot;, dedicated team store buildings replacing the tents that previously served as team stores, bullpen overlooks with overlook bars, and tree relocation at the top of the stadium.

On July 23, 2019, a press conference was held with the presentation of the $100 million renovation to the ballpark, which includes a center field plaza with a children&#x27;s playground located between the left field and right field bleachers, the relocation of the Jackie Robinson statue from the left field entrance to the center field playground, as well as a display honoring the Legends of Dodger Baseball, along with a sports bar and a beer garden.

Also included as part of the renovation were new elevators and escalators which connect the outfield bleachers with the field, loge and reserve levels, a new stadium center main entrance, and the commission of a statue of Sandy Koufax which was to be unveiled next to the statue of Robinson. While the renovations were completed during the delayed 2020 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the unveiling of Koufax&#x27;s statue was delayed two years.

==Features==

===Design===
Dodger Stadium was one of the last baseball-only facilities built before the dawn of the multi-purpose stadium. It was built near the convergence of several freeways near downtown Los Angeles, with an expansive parking lot surrounding the stadium. With the construction of many new MLB ballparks in recent years, it is now the third-oldest park still in use, and the oldest on the West Coast.

Dodger Stadium offered several innovative design features. One of these was a covered and screened section of dugout-level seats behind home plate. Dodger owner Walter O&#x27;Malley was inspired to incorporate this feature into the Dodger Stadium design after having seen it at Tokyo&#x27;s Korakuen Stadium during the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; postseason goodwill tour of Japan in 1956. The original dugout seating area was replaced by more conventional box seating in a 1999 renovation, but this feature has been replicated at Progressive Field in Cleveland and Angel Stadium of Anaheim.

Two of Dodger Stadium&#x27;s most distinctive features are the wavy roof atop each outfield pavilion and the top of a 10-story elevator shaft bearing the Dodger logo rising directly behind home plate at the top of the uppermost seating level.

A unique terraced-earthworks parking lot was built behind the main stands, allowing ticket-holders to park at roughly the level of their seats, minimizing use of ramps once inside. The stadium was also designed to be earthquake-resistant, an important consideration in California, and it has withstood several serious earthquakes.

Dodger Stadium was originally equipped with two large Fair Play electronic scoreboard units above the left- and right-field pavilions. The right-field board displayed in-game information. The left-field board displayed scores of out-of-town games and other messages. Smaller auxiliary scoreboards were installed at field level on the box seat fences beyond the first- and third-base dugouts during the inaugural 1962 season. The left-field message board was replaced by a Mitsubishi Electric Diamond Vision video board in 1980. The field-level auxiliary scoreboards were replaced by larger units installed on the facade of the Loge (second) seating level in 1998; these, in turn, were replaced by a video ribbon board in 2006. Field-level out-of-town scoreboards were installed on the left- and right-field walls in 2003.

Strobe lights were added in 2001; they flash when the Dodgers take the field, after a Dodger home run, and after a Dodger win. In 2018, blue strobe lights were added.

===Retired numbers===
In addition to those of Don Drysdale (53), Sandy Koufax (32), and Don Sutton (20), the retired numbers of Pee Wee Reese (1), Jackie Robinson (42), Duke Snider (4), Tommy Lasorda (2), Walter Alston (24), Roy Campanella (39), Jim Gilliam (19), Gil Hodges (14), and Fernando Valenzuela (34) are mounted on the club level facade near the left field foul pole. Also honored on the left field line in addition to the retired numbers are broadcasters Vin Scully and Jaime Jarrin, and longtime owner Walter O&#x27;Malley.

===Statues===
On April 15, 2017, to mark the 70th anniversary of Robinson&#x27;s major league debut, the Dodgers unveiled a bronze statue of the historic player in the stadium&#x27;s left-field plaza. The sculpture, made by sculptor Branly Cadet, depicts Robinson sliding into home plate as a rookie.

On June 18, 2022, the Dodgers unveiled a bronze statue of Sandy Koufax in the centerfield plaza, next to the statue of Robinson, which had been moved there in 2020 as part of renovations. The sculpture, which was also made by Cadet, depicts Koufax&#x27;s signature leg kick as he goes into his windup.

===Location===

Built on top of the historic Los Angeles neighborhood of Chavez Ravine in Solano Canyon, the stadium overlooks downtown Los Angeles and provides views of the city to the south, the green tree-lined hills of Elysian Park to the north and east, and the San Gabriel Mountains beyond the outfield pavilions. Due to dry summers in Southern California, rainouts at Dodger Stadium are rare. Prior to 1976, the Dodgers were rained out only once, against the St. Louis Cardinals, on April 21, 1967, ending a streak of 737 consecutive games without a postponement. On April 12, 1976, the second home rainout ended a streak of 724 straight games. April 19–21, 1988 saw three consecutive rainouts, the only time consecutive games have been rained out at Dodger Stadium. No rainouts occurred between April 21, 1988, and April 11, 1999 – a major league record of 856 straight home games without a rainout. That record has since been broken, with no rainouts since April 17, 2000, 1,471 consecutive games through October 3, 2019.

===Seating===
Dodger Stadium has never increased its seating capacity, and was the only current MLB park (through 2005) that had never done so, due to a conditional-use permit that limits Dodger Stadium&#x27;s seating capacity to 56,000. Whenever higher-revenue lower seats were added, some in the upper deck or pavilion were removed to keep the number the same. Through the sale of standing room only tickets, the Dodgers&#x27; 2009 home opener drew 57,099 fans, the largest crowd in stadium history. Following a number of incidents in the early 1970s in which fans showered Cincinnati Reds left fielder Pete Rose with beer, bottles, cups, and trash, the sale of beer was discontinued in both pavilions. Beer sales were reinstated in the right field pavilion in 2008, when that section was converted into the All You Can Eat Pavilion. Fans seated in that section can eat unlimited hot dogs and peanuts and also have access to free soft drinks. There is a charge for beer.

With the retirement of the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in 2008, the park reigned as the largest capacity ballpark in the Majors.

As of 2010, there are a total of 2,098 club seats and 68 luxury suites. Both of these amounts will increase once the renovations are complete, with the necessary offset to comply with its conditional-use permit.

Due to renovations made in the 2012–2013 offseason, the current maximum capacity of Dodger Stadium is less than 56,000, although the team&#x27;s president, Stan Kasten, refuses to provide an exact number. A 53,393 attendance is considered a sellout. The high water mark since the renovations is 56,800 in Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2008 NLCS. The team&#x27;s 2013 media guide and website still report the capacity as 56,000.

Dodger Stadium achieved record paid attendance during the 2024 season with 3,941,251 spectators.

===Field dimensions and &quot;pitchers&#x27; park&quot; reputation===
==== Historical reputation ====
For various reasons, Dodger Stadium has long enjoyed a reputation as a pitchers&#x27; park. The park has been home to 13 no-hitters, including two perfect games (by the Dodgers&#x27; Sandy Koufax in 1965 and by Dennis Martínez of the former Montreal Expos in ). Pitchers such as Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Don Sutton, Fernando Valenzuela, and Orel Hershiser became superstars after arriving in Los Angeles. In addition, players have hit for the cycle just twice in Dodger Stadium (Jim Fregosi in 1964 and Orlando Hudson in 2009).

At first, the relatively deep outfield dimensions were a factor, with the power alleys being about . Home plate was moved toward center field in 1969, but that move also expanded foul ground by , a tradeoff which helped to offset the increased likelihood of home runs caused by the decreased field dimensions.

Night games at Dodger Stadium are said to be particularly pitcher-friendly due to the so-called &quot;marine layer effect.&quot; According to the marine layer theory, as the sun sets, the surrounding air at Dodger and Angel Stadiums cools quickly due to the ocean climate, becoming more dense. As a result, deep fly balls that might otherwise be home runs during the day instead often remain in play becoming outs. Although Torii Hunter estimated that the marine layer can decrease fly ball distance by 15 feet, two researchers concluded in 2017 that while &quot;the marine layer has a statistically significant effect on flyball distance [in Petco Park and Oakland Coliseum] ... [t]he effect size is around six feet,&quot; and Dodger Stadium&#x27;s marine layer effect was close to zero. From 2022 to 2024, Dodger Stadium&#x27;s night-game home run park factor was 126 (i.e., the stadium inflated home runs by 26%), the second-highest in MLB.

==== Dimensions ====
Although the distance to center field has been marked at 395 feet since 1973, it is still actually to center, as has been the case since 1969. The two signs erected in 1973 are to the left and right of dead center. However, curvature of the fence between the posted distance signs is not exactly radial from home plate, thus the distance from home plate directly to center field is most likely farther than the posted . As of 2012, distance to center field is indicated , and is located virtually exactly at the center field point.

With the opening of Citi Field and the demolition of Shea Stadium in 2009, Dodger Stadium became the only stadium with symmetrical outfield dimensions remaining in the National League and only one of three total in Major League Baseball. The other two symmetrical fields are Kansas City&#x27;s Kauffman Stadium, and Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, both in the American League.

==== Transition from pitchers&#x27; park to neutral venue ====

Following the 1968 &quot;Year of the Pitcher,&quot; MLB issued league-wide changes to favor batting, including lowering the height of the pitcher&#x27;s mound. In addition, the Dodgers moved the diamond about 10 feet (3 m) towards center field, which was partially credited for generating 46 more home runs than the prior season.

According to MLB&#x27;s park factor database, Dodger Stadium decreased offense by 6% from 1997 to 1999 (the first year data was reported), making it the most pitcher-friendly park in MLB during this period. However, the park actually inflated home runs by 3%, and achieved the low park factor primarily by deflating doubles (by 21%) and triples (by 45%). This effect has been attributed to the stadium&#x27;s uniform outfield walls and relatively small &quot;corners&quot; near the foul poles. The extremely short outfield walls near the foul poles also make some balls that would bounce off the wall in other parks go for home runs.

Following the 2004 season, the Dodgers&#x27; then-owner Frank McCourt installed 1,600 high-priced field level seats, shrinking Dodger Stadium&#x27;s foul territory from 30,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet. The team noted that the dimensions of the fair territory had not been changed and predicted that the stadium would remain a pitchers&#x27; park. From 2005 to 2007, MLB ranked Dodger Stadium as a balanced park, with an exactly average park factor. The stadium continued to depress doubles and triples, but inflated walks by 7%. However, from 2008 to 2010, the stadium returned to its original status as a pitchers&#x27; park, decreasing total offense by 7%. FanGraphs noted in 2018 that many other teams had been shrinking their foul territory, although Dodger Stadium still has less foul territory than most MLB ballparks. Since park factors are based on MLB averages and not absolute values, a league-wide decrease in foul territory would by definition make Dodger Stadium&#x27;s limited foul territory look more pitcher-friendly.

From 2022 to 2024, MLB ranked Dodger Stadium as a balanced park once again. Although the stadium depresses walks and most types of hits, it inflates home runs by 22%. In 2024, BetMGM stated that Dodger Stadium&#x27;s 395-feet centerfield distance was the third-shortest in baseball, behind only Fenway Park and Oracle Park.

<text>Chattanooga ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Hamilton County, Tennessee, United States. It is located along the Tennessee River, and borders Georgia to the south. With a population of 181,099 in 2020, it is Tennessee&#x27;s fourth-most populous city and one of the two principal cities of East Tennessee, along with Knoxville. It anchors the Chattanooga metropolitan area, Tennessee&#x27;s fourth-largest metropolitan statistical area, as well as a larger three-state area that includes Southeast Tennessee, Northwest Georgia, and Northeast Alabama.

Chattanooga was a crucial city during the American Civil War due to the multiple railroads that converge there. After the war, the railroads allowed for the city to grow into one of the Southeastern United States&#x27; largest heavy industrial hubs. Today, major industry that drives the economy includes automotive, advanced manufacturing, food and beverage production, healthcare, insurance, tourism, and back office and corporate headquarters. Chattanooga remains a transit hub in the present day, served by multiple Interstate highways and railroad lines. It is northwest of Atlanta, Georgia, southwest of Knoxville, Tennessee, southeast of Nashville, Tennessee, east-northeast of Huntsville, Alabama, and northeast of Birmingham, Alabama.

Divided by the Tennessee River, Chattanooga is at the transition between the ridge-and-valley Appalachians and the Cumberland Plateau, both of which are part of the larger Appalachian Mountains. Its official nickname is the &quot;Scenic City&quot;, alluding to the surrounding mountains, ridges, and valleys. Unofficial nicknames include &quot;River City&quot;, &quot;Chatt&quot;, &quot;Nooga&quot;, &quot;Chattown&quot;, and &quot;Gig City&quot;, the latter a reference to its claims that it has the fastest internet service in the Western Hemisphere.

Chattanooga is internationally known from the 1941 hit song &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; by Glenn Miller and his orchestra. It is home to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC) and Chattanooga State Community College.

==History==
===Early history===
The first inhabitants of the Chattanooga area were Native Americans. Sites dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period (c. 10,000 BCE) show continuous human occupation through the Archaic, Woodland, Mississippian/Muskogean/Yuchi (900–1714 CE), and Cherokee (1776–1838) periods. The Chickamauga Mound near the mouth of the Chickamauga Creek is the oldest () remaining visible art in Chattanooga.

The Citico town and mound site was the most significant Mississippian/Muscogee landmark in Chattanooga up to 1915. The first part of the name &quot;Chattanooga&quot; derives from the Muskogean word &quot;cvto&quot; /chắtȯ/ – &#x27;rock&#x27;. The latter may be derived from a regional suffix &quot;-nuga&quot; meaning dwelling or dwelling place. It is also believed to be derived from the Creek Indian word &quot;Chat-to-to-noog-gee&quot;, meaning &#x27;rock rising to a point&#x27;, which is speculated to be a reference to Lookout Mountain.

The earliest Cherokee occupation of the area dates from 1776, when Dragging Canoe separated himself from the main tribe to establish resistance to European settlement during the Cherokee–American wars. In 1816 John Ross, who later became Principal Chief, established Ross&#x27;s Landing. Located along what is now Broad Street, it became one of the centers of Cherokee Nation settlement, which also extended into Georgia and Alabama.

In 1838, the U.S. government forced the Cherokees, along with other Native Americans, to relocate to the area designated as Indian Territory, in what is now the state of Oklahoma. Their journey west became known as the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; for their exile and fatalities along the way. The U.S. Army used Ross&#x27;s Landing as the site of one of three large internment camps, or &quot;emigration depots&quot;, where Native Americans were held before the journey on the Trail of Tears.

In 1839, the community of Ross&#x27;s Landing incorporated as the city of Chattanooga. The city grew quickly, initially benefiting from a location well-suited for river commerce. With the arrival of the railroad in 1850, Chattanooga became a boom town. The city was known as the site &quot;where cotton meets corn,&quot; referring to its location along the cultural boundary between the mountain communities of southern Appalachia and the cotton-growing states to the south.
===Civil War===

During the American Civil War, Chattanooga was a center of battle. Chattanooga served as a hub connecting fifty percent of the Confederacy&#x27;s arsenals, those being located in Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, and Macon. Chattanooga&#x27;s railroads were vital to the Confederacy&#x27;s transportation of raw material to processing plants for producing small arms munitions. During the Chickamauga Campaign, Union artillery bombarded Chattanooga as a diversion and occupied it on September 9, 1863. Following the Battle of Chickamauga, the defeated Union Army retreated to safety in Chattanooga. On November 23, 1863, the Battles for Chattanooga began when Union forces led by Major General Ulysses S. Grant reinforced troops at Chattanooga and advanced to Orchard Knob against Confederate troops besieging the city. The next day, the Battle of Lookout Mountain was fought, driving the Confederates off the mountain. On November 25, Grant&#x27;s army routed the Confederates in the Battle of Missionary Ridge. In regard to victories won by the Union, Chattanooga marks one of three defining moments that turned the Civil War in their favor. The Battle of Gettysburg brought the streak of victories obtained by the Confederacy to an end, while the Siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy itself in half, while Chattanooga served as the doorway to the Deep South. These battles were followed the next spring by the Atlanta Campaign, beginning just over the nearby state line in Georgia and moving southeastward. After the war ended, the city became a major railroad hub and industrial and manufacturing center.

===1867 flood===
The largest flood in Chattanooga&#x27;s history occurred in 1867, before the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) system was created in 1933 by Congress. The flood crested at and completely inundated the city. Since the completion of the reservoir system, the highest Chattanooga flood stage has been nearly , which occurred in 1973. Without regulation, the flood would have crested at . Chattanooga was a major priority in the design of the TVA reservoir system and remains a major operating priority in the 21st century.

===20th century===
In December 1906, Chattanooga was in the national headlines in &quot;United States v. Shipp,&quot; as the United States Supreme Court, in the only criminal trial in its history, ruled that Hamilton County Sheriff Joseph H. Shipp had violated Ed Johnson&#x27;s civil rights when Shipp allowed a mob to enter the Hamilton County jail and lynch Johnson on the Walnut Street Bridge.

Chattanooga grew with the entry of the United States in the First World War in 1917; the nearest training camp was in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. The Influenza pandemic of 1918 closed local movie theaters and pool halls. By the 1930s, Chattanooga was known as the &quot;Dynamo of Dixie&quot;, inspiring the 1941 Glenn Miller big-band swing song &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot;. Through Mayor P.R. Olgiati&#x27;s efforts, Chattanooga became the first city in Tennessee to have a completed interstate highway system in the latter 1960s. In February 1958, Chattanooga became one of the smallest cities in the country with three VHF television stations: WROM-TV (now WTVC-TV) channel 9 (ABC), WRGP-TV (now WRCB-TV) channel 3 (NBC), and WDEF-TV channel 12 (CBS).

The same mountains that provide Chattanooga&#x27;s scenic backdrop also trap industrial pollutants, which settle over the city. In 1969, the federal government declared that Chattanooga had the dirtiest air in the nation. Like other early industrial cities, Chattanooga entered the 1970s with serious socioeconomic challenges, including job layoffs because of de-industrialization, deteriorating city infrastructure, racial tensions, and social division. Chattanooga&#x27;s population increased by nearly 50,000 in the 1970s. However, this was mostly because the city annexed nearby residential areas. By the mid-1980s, local leaders launched Vision 2000, an effort to revitalize and reinvent Chattanooga&#x27;s culture and economy. Chattanooga&#x27;s population declined by more than 10% in the 1980s, but regained it over the next two decades, the only major U.S. city to do so in that period.

==== Civil Rights Movement ====
The civil rights movement of Chattanooga began in 1960 when teenage students of Howard High School, inspired by activists in Nashville and Greensboro, began to organize a similar sit-in protest. Class President Paul Walker, Lehman Pierce and as many as 200 other black students organized peaceful sit-ins at four businesses along one block in downtown Chattanooga. White youth mobs responded with agitation, inflammatory language and violence. By the third day, Mayor Rudy Olgiatti instructed the fire department to utilize water hoses on crowds becoming the first city to utilize this tactic against protesters. Three months later the city would agree to desegregate the downtown businesses.

Unlike many southern cities the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. did not lead to riots in Chattanooga. Mayor Kelley and Police Commissioner Turner met with young people to defuse the situation and bought the protesters lunch. The frustrated youths voiced their complaints about racial injustice in Chattanooga, but were convinced to peacefully disperse.

In 1971, John Franklin Sr. became the first African-American elected official of Chattanooga. However racial tensions related to poverty and education continued to simmer. In the same year, a cancelled concert refusing to give ticket refunds sparked a four-day riot of black youth. An all-night curfew was called and close to 2,000 National Guard troops arrived in the city, setting up a post at City Hall. The unrest led to 1 death and 300 arrests.

On April 19, 1980, three Ku Klux Klan members rode down historic 9th street and opened fire on five black women: Viola Ellison, Lela Mae Evans, Katherine O. Johnson, Opal Lee Jackson and Fannie Crumsey. All of the women survived. When an all-white jury acquitted the three Klan members for their crime, Chattanooga erupted into four nights of rioting. Not deterred by the jury verdict, the five women went on to be plaintiffs in a historic civil lawsuit against the Klan. In 1982, the federal courts ordered the Klan to pay the women $535,000 on account of the attack. This case created the legal strategy for dismantling the Klan across the country in the following years.

In 1987, the city&#x27;s at-large voting process was challenged on the basis that it marginalized the voting power of Black voters. The issue was initially presented by Lorenzo Ervin, Annie Thomas and Maxine Cousin to the ACLU in Atlanta. Following the case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Commissioners of Chattanooga,&quot; the city terminated the at-large voting system.

===21st century===

Chattanooga launched the first government-provided one-gigabit-per-second Internet service in the United States in September 2010, provided through the city-owned utility EPB.

In August 2012, Chattanooga developed its own typeface, called &quot;Chatype&quot;, which marks the first time a municipality has its own typeface in the United States and the first crowd-funded, custom-made typeface in the world.

On July 16, 2015, five people — four U.S. Marines and one sailor — were murdered and two more were wounded in shootings at two U.S. military facilities in Chattanooga. The perpetrator was Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, an Islamic terrorist.

On November 21, 2016, a school bus carrying students from Woodmore Elementary School crashed in the Brainerd neighborhood, killing 6 and injuring 23. In March 2018, the driver, an employee of Durham School Services, was convicted of six counts of criminally negligent homicide, 11 counts of reckless aggravated assault, seven counts of assault, reckless endangerment, reckless driving and illegally using his phone while driving. The crash reignited the debate about whether seat belts should be required in school buses.

On June 5, 2022, there was a mass shooting in Chattanooga that left three dead and injured 11.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 5.12%, are water. The most prominent natural features in and around Chattanooga are the Tennessee River and the surrounding mountains. The Tennessee River is impounded by the Chickamauga Dam north of the downtown area. The city is nestled between the southwestern Ridge-and-valley Appalachians and the foot of Walden&#x27;s Ridge; the river separates the ridge from the western side of downtown. Several miles east, the city is bisected by Missionary Ridge. The downtown area sits at an elevation of approximately , one of the lowest elevations in East Tennessee.

===Cityscape===
Downtown Chattanooga has a wide variety of entertainment, dining, cultural and architectural attractions, including the Tennessee Aquarium, opened in 1992; the Creative Discovery Museum, opened in 1995; and the historic Walnut Street Bridge, reopened in 1993. The downtown footprint is bounded by interstate highway I-24 on the south to Frazier Avenue in the Northshore, as well as US highway 27 in the west to Central Avenue in the east.

The modern downtown skyline is dominated by the Aquarium, the Republic Centre (tallest building in Chattanooga), John C. Portman Jr.&#x27;s the Westin (Gold Building), the James Building (Chattanooga&#x27;s first skyscraper), and The Block, a climbing gym with 5,000 square feet of functional climbing space. Chattanooga has buildings with historical significance, such as The Read House Hotel (the longest continuously operating hotel in the Southeastern United States), the Chattanooga Choo-Choo Hotel (a converted railroad terminal), the Maclellan Building, the Dome Building (once the home to the Chattanooga Times), and the Tivoli Theatre. The BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee headquarters, atop Cameron Hill, is the second-largest LEED Gold-certified corporate campus in the nation.

Downtown Chattanooga has four main bridges over the Tennessee River: the Walnut Street Bridge, the Market Street Bridge, the Olgiati Bridge, and the Veterans Memorial Bridge. These bridges allow pedestrians to connect the Riverfront and Northshore to the Tennessee Riverwalk and Bluff View Art District. Downtown Chattanooga parks include Coolidge Park, Renaissance Park, Miller Park, Miller Plaza and Main Terrain Art Park. The Martin Luther King District runs parallel to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga&#x27;s campus and features the largest mural in Chattanooga. The 40,000-square-foot mural was created by Philadelphia-based muralist Meg Saligman and seven other local artists.

==== Downtown revitalization ====
In late 20th and early 21st centuries, substantial private and governmental resources have been invested in transforming the city&#x27;s tarnished image. In 1993, restoration of the Walnut Street Bridge was completed. An excellent specimen of the Camelback truss bridge, it is the oldest surviving bridge of its kind in the Southeastern United States, having been built in 1891. Efforts to improve the city include the &quot;21st Century Waterfront Plan&quot; – a $120 million redevelopment of the Chattanooga waterfront area, which was completed in 2005. The Tennessee Aquarium, which opened in 1992, has become a major waterfront attraction that has helped to spur neighborhood development. Since the opening of the aquarium, downtown Chattanooga has received over $5 billion of private investment, including nearly $1 billion from 2014 to 2018.

The city has won three national awards for outstanding &quot;livability&quot;, and nine Gunther Blue Ribbon Awards for excellence in housing and consolidated planning. Public art experts chose Passageways 2.0 City Thread from among 50 outstanding public art projects created in 2018 through the Public Art Network Year in Review program, a national program that recognizes compelling public art. In addition to winning various national and regional awards, Chattanooga has been in the national limelight numerous times. Chattanooga was the profile city of the August 2007 edition of &quot;US Airways Magazine&quot;. Chattanooga-based businesses have been recognized for their investment in solar energy. In December 2009, Chattanooga was ranked 8th out of America&#x27;s 100 largest metro areas for the best &quot;Bang For Your Buck&quot; city, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, which measured overall affordability, housing rates, and more.

Snowfall is highly variable from year to year. were recorded between January 9–10, 2011. The average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity. Summers are hot and humid, with a July daily mean of and 52 days annually with or greater temperatures. Chattanooga is the sixth fastest warming city in the United States due to climate change.

Average annual precipitation is over . On average, November through March represents an extended relatively wet period, because of Chattanooga&#x27;s frequent placement (in the winter season) in a zone of conflict between warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada, amplified by jet-stream energy and abundant Gulf moisture. July presents a secondary maximum in precipitation, due to frequent thunderstorm activity. Despite the mountains that surround the city, Chattanooga has been affected by tornadoes. These tornadoes include the 2011 Super Outbreak, which impacted the city and nearby locations, including Apison and Cherokee Valley in Catoosa County, Georgia, where fifteen people died, eight in Apison and seven in Cherokee Valley. An EF3 tornado struck southeastern portions of Chattanooga on the night of April 12, 2020, and caused significant damage and three fatalities.

== Economy ==

Chattanooga&#x27;s economy includes a diversified and growing mix of manufacturing and service industries.

Notable Chattanooga businesses include Access America Transport, BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, CBL &amp; Associates, The Chattanooga Bakery, Sanofi, the world&#x27;s first Coca-Cola bottling plant, Coker Tire, U.S. Xpress Inc., Covenant Logistics, Double Cola, CraftWorks Restaurants &amp; Breweries, Luken Communications, Miller &amp; Martin, the National Model Railroad Association, PepsiCo, Reliance Partners, Republic Parking System, Rock/Creek, Tricycle Inc., and Unum. The city also hosts large branch offices of Cigna, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile USA, and UBS. McKee Foods Corporation, the maker of nationally known Little Debbie brand snack cakes, is a privately held, family-run company headquartered in nearby Collegedale, Tennessee.

Notable companies that have manufacturing or distribution facilities in the city include Amazon.com, BASF, DuPont, Invista, Komatsu, PepsiCo, Rock-Tenn, Plantronics, Domtar, Norfolk Southern, Ferrara Candy Company (manufacturer of Brach&#x27;s candies), Alco Chemical, Colonial Pipeline, and Buzzi Unicem. The William Wrigley Jr. Company has a prominent presence in Chattanooga, the sole site of production of Altoids breath mint products since 2005.

In a seminal event for Chattanooga, Volkswagen announced in July 2008 the construction of its first U.S. auto plant in over three decades, the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant. In May 2011, Volkswagen Group of America inaugurated its plant. The $1 billion plant, opened in May 2011, served as the group&#x27;s North American manufacturing headquarters. The plant, which initially employed 2,700 people, later increasing to 4,700, manufactures the Passat and the Atlas. It also has a full research and development center in downtown Chattanooga, employing some 200 engineers, the first of its kind in the South. The plant was the first new Volkswagen plant in the United States since the 1988 closure of Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly near New Stanton, Pennsylvania. In 2019, Volkswagen Chattanooga announced plans to expand its Chattanooga-based plant to construct electric vehicles. The expansion is expected to create one thousand new jobs and $800 million in investments.

In addition to corporate business interests, there are many retail shops in Chattanooga, including two shopping malls: Hamilton Place Mall in East Brainerd and Northgate Mall in Hixson. Eastgate Mall in Brainerd used to be a shopping mall, but has changed into a multi-use office building. Tourism and Hospitality has been a growing part of Chattanooga&#x27;s economy, with 2014 being the first year for Hamilton County to surpass $1 billion in revenue.

Startups have been an increasing trend, due in part to EPB&#x27;s fiber optic grid. Notable venture firms based in the city are Blank Slate Ventures, Chattanooga Renaissance Fund, Lamp Post Group, SwiftWing Ventures, the Jump Fund, Dynamo Ventures, and Brickyard VC. The city is served by several incubators, notably Co.Lab, the Business Development Center, and Lamp Post Group. The Business Development Center is among the nation&#x27;s largest incubators, both in square footage and in the number of startups that it supports. Co-working spaces have picked up downtown, including Society of Work and Chattanooga Workspace. Unique in the city is the startup accelerator Gigtank, which utilizes the city&#x27;s gigabit capacities and focuses on 3D printing, healthcare, and smartgrid technologies. Notable startups include Quickcue (acquired by OpenTable in 2013), and Reliance Partners. Chattanooga went from zero investable capital in 2009 to over $50 million in 2014.

===Utilities===
Electric power for most of the city and surrounding area is provided by the city-run Electric Power Board (EPB). EPB also provides high-speed Internet service, TV, and telephone service to business and residential customers throughout Hamilton County, as well as parts of Bledsoe County, Bradley County, Catoosa County, Dade County, Marion County, Rhea County, Sequatchie County, and Walker County, via the nation&#x27;s largest municipally owned fiber optic system. TVA operates the nearby Sequoyah Nuclear Power Plant, Chickamauga Dam, and the Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant, all of which provide electricity to the greater Chattanooga area. TVA&#x27;s corporate power generation and distribution organization is headquartered in downtown Chattanooga.

Natural gas and water are provided by the privately run Chattanooga Gas Company and Tennessee-American Water Company, respectively. In 2005, Mayor Ron Littlefield stated his desire for the city to purchase the Tennessee-American Water Company, which was sold in a public offering in 2007. Former Mayor Jon Kinsey&#x27;s attempts to have the city buy control of Tennessee-American Water were defeated in court.

EPB Fiber Optics is the dominant cable and internet service provider for most areas of the city. The incumbent telephone company is AT&amp;T Inc. However, competing phone companies, such as EPB, cellular phones, and VoIP are making inroads. A major interstate fiber optics line operated by AT&amp;T traverses the city, making its way from Atlanta to Cincinnati. There are more choices among TV, Internet, and phone service providers for Chattanooga residents than in most other cities its size because of the intense competition between AT&amp;T, Comcast, and EPB.

===EPB&#x27;s gigabit public fiber optic network===

Beginning in 2009 and continuing through March 2011, when Haletown, Tennessee, received service from EPB&#x27;s fiber optic network, EPB began to establish its exclusive fiber optic network to its service area, which covers the greater Chattanooga Metropolitan Statistical Area. In September 2010, EPB became the first municipally-owned utilities company in the United States to offer internet access directly to the public at speeds up to ten gigabit (10,000 megabits) per second. The network has been emulated by at least six other cities in Tennessee and studied by other cities in the U.S. and internationally. However, Tennessee state law has prevented the expansion of Chattanooga&#x27;s municipal network to nearby communities that have requested connections, and that restriction was upheld in the 2016 circuit court ruling &quot;Tennessee v. FCC&quot;.

Jay Weatherill, South Australia&#x27;s Premier, visited Chattanooga in January 2012 and studied the gigabit network that was supporting critical city safety functions such as police and fire communications infrastructure, equipment and applications. He also inspected wastewater management, storm water management, traffic control and medical diagnostics applications, as well as operations of a smart lighting and camera system that allows the police to control public lighting and see what is happening in heavy crime areas. The use of broadband to carry the video and control signaling has contributed to making Chattanooga&#x27;s Coolidge Park a safer place to visit.

In 2011, the expansion of EPB&#x27;s network became a subject of major controversy in Tennessee. The success of its network, credited with the expansion of Volkswagen&#x27;s Chattanooga plant and the establishment of Amazon.com facilities in Chattanooga and Cleveland, led to a number of legal challenges by AT&amp;T and Comcast insisting that public funds not be used to fund expansion of public networks in competition with private ones. However, according to EPB, federal agencies, electricity industry trade sources, and other press sources, the investment in the fully fiber optic network is justified by electrical system benefits alone, including early fault detection and decreases in standby power.

===Banking===

As of 2014, there are 27 banks operating in the Chattanooga metropolitan area, lending to financial strength. Among the larger banks are regional banks First Horizon Bank, Truist Financial, and Regions Financial Corporation, but the area also has offices from UBS, Chase, and Bank of America. Due in part to the strength and growing economic development, Chase recently shifted its East Tennessee headquarters from Knoxville to Chattanooga.

In early 2015, three locally owned banks and one in nearby Cleveland, Tennessee, were acquired by other banks. CapitalMark, formed in 2007, will be acquired by the Nashville-based Pinnacle Financial Partners for $187 million to have the fourth largest market share in the Chattanooga metro area. First Security Group, Inc, the largest Chattanooga-based bank, formed in 2000, will be acquired by the Atlanta-based Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc., for $160 million. Cornerstone, started in 1985, will merge with the Knoxville-based SmartBank in a stock deal. Cleveland&#x27;s Southern Heritage Bank was acquired in 2014 by First Citizens National Bank in Dyersburg, Tennessee, for $32.2 million. All these mergers only leave one Chattanooga-based, independent bank, First Volunteer Bank. Others in the area locally based include Dunlap, Tennessee-based Citizens Tri-County Bank, Ooltewah-based Community Trust and Banking Co., Dayton, Tennessee-based Community National Bank, Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia-based Capital Bank, LaFayette, Georgia-based Bank of LaFayette, and Cleveland-based Bank of Cleveland.

In 2019, Chattanooga FC became one of the founding members of NPSL&#x27;s Founders Cup, a group of eleven teams playing a professional tournament in the fall before forming a fully professional league in 2020. To support this, Chattanooga FC became only the second sports team in the U.S., after the Green Bay Packers, to sell supporter shares in the team. These moves were partially in response to a USL League One franchise, the Chattanooga Red Wolves SC starting play in the 2019 inaugural season of that new third-tier professional league under the direction of Chattanooga FC&#x27;s former general manager. The Red Wolves play in USL League One and intend to build a multi-million dollar soccer specific stadium in the neighboring town of East Ridge, Tennessee.

===Newspapers===
The &quot;Chattanooga Times Free Press&quot;, the area&#x27;s only daily newspaper, is published every morning. It was formed in 1999 from the merger of two papers that had been bitter rivals for half a century, the &quot;Times&quot; and the &quot;News-Free Press&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; was owned and published by Adolph Ochs, who later bought &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; was the morning paper and had a generally more liberal editorial page. The &quot;News-Free Press&quot;, whose name was the result of an earlier merger, was an afternoon daily and its editorials were more conservative than those in the &quot;Times&quot;. On August 27, 1966, the &quot;News-Free Press&quot; became the first newspaper in the nation to dissolve a joint operating agreement. In 1999, the &quot;Free Press&quot;, which had changed its name from &quot;News-Free Press&quot; in 1993, was bought by an Arkansas company, WEHCO Media, publisher of the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,&quot; which then bought The &quot;Times&quot; from the Ochs heirs. The &quot;Times Free Press&quot; is the only newspaper in the United States to have two editorial pages, reflecting opposite ends of the political spectrum. The &quot;Times&quot;″s editorial page, which is liberal, is on the left page and the &quot;Free Press&quot;″s editorial page, which is conservative, is on the right.

The &quot;Chattanooga Pulse&quot; is a free weekly alternative newspaper, published every Wednesday, that focuses primarily on arts, music, film and culture.

==Law and government==

The current mayor is Tim Kelly, who was elected in April 2021. 

The city operates under a charter granted by the state legislature in 1852; the charter has been subsequently amended.

The city operates under a strong mayor system, which changed from a commission form of government with members voted at-large. In 1987 twelve African American city residents filed a complaint, &quot;Brown v. Board of Commissioners of the City of Chattanooga&quot;, alleging that the commission-style government violated their civil rights, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, by diluting the minority black vote. In 1989 U.S. District Judge R. Allan Edgar ruled in their favor, compelling the city to abandon the at-large voting system that it had used for the &#x27;commission&#x27; form of government, established single-member geographical districts to proportionally represent both majority and minority elements of the population according to the city&#x27;s racial demographics, eliminated voting privileges for non-resident property owners, and created the city&#x27;s current mayor-council form of government. The Chattanooga City Council has nine members, of whom four are African American. The strong-mayor system began in 1991 after a 1990 citywide election that used the new court-ordered district system.

The city&#x27;s legislative branch is represented by members from nine districts, elected from single-member districts in partisan elections. The current council members are Chip Henderson (District 1), Jenny Hill (District 2), Ken Smith (District 3), Darrin Ledford (District 4), Isiah Hester (District 5), Jenni Berz (District 6), Raquetta Dotley (District 7), Marvene Noel (District 8), and Demetrus Coonrod (District 9).

Chattanooga&#x27;s delegation to the Tennessee House of Representatives includes Robin Smith (R), District 26; Patsy Hazlewood (R), District 27; Yusuf Hakeem (D), District 28; Mike Carter (R), District 29; and Esther Helton (R), District 30. In the Tennessee Senate, Chattanooga is divided between Districts 10 and 11 with Todd Gardenhire (R) and Bo Watson (R) representing each district respectively.

Chattanooga is represented in the United States House of Representatives by Chuck Fleischmann (R), who represents the 3rd District. In the United States Senate, both Marsha Blackburn (R) and Bill Hagerty (R) have district offices in Chattanooga.

Chattanooga, as the county seat of Hamilton County, is home to Chattanooga&#x27;s City Courts and Hamilton County&#x27;s Courts.

Chattanooga is the location of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee&#x27;s Southern Division, which is housed in the Joel W. Solomon Federal Courthouse. The Southern Division has jurisdiction over Bledsoe, Bradley, Hamilton, Marion, McMinn, Meigs, Polk, Rhea, and Sequatchie counties.

The Chattanooga Police Department dates from 1852. Starting in 1883, it hired black police officers, making Chattanooga one of the first major Southern cities to have them. But after the state legislature imposed segregation, black police officers were dropped from the force. They were hired again on a permanent basis beginning on August 11, 1948, years before other major cities in the Southeast, such as Birmingham, Alabama and Jackson, Mississippi, integrated their police departments. The first seven black officers in 1948, Thaddeus Arnold, Singer Askins, W.B. Baulridge, C.E. Black, Morris Glenn, Arthur Heard, and Thomas Patterson, were initially restricted to walking beats in black neighborhoods. In 1960, black police officers were authorized to patrol all neighborhoods and arrest white citizens.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary education===
Most of Chattanooga&#x27;s primary and secondary education is funded by the government. The public schools in Chattanooga, as well as Hamilton County, have fallen under the purview of the Hamilton County Schools since the 1997 merger of the urban Chattanooga City Schools system and the mostly rural Hamilton County Schools system. The Howard School was the first public school in the area, established in 1865 after the Civil War. Tyner High School (now Tyner Academy) was the first secondary school built east of Missionary Ridge in 1907. It is now the home of Tyner Middle Academy. The Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences, the STEM School Of Chattanooga and the Chattanooga High School Center for Creative Arts are additional public magnet schools.

The city is home to several well-known private and parochial secondary schools, including Baylor School, Boyd-Buchanan School, Chattanooga Christian School, Girls Preparatory School, McCallie School, and Notre Dame High School. The Siskin Children&#x27;s Institute in Chattanooga is a specialized institution in the field of early childhood special education.

===Higher education===
A wide variety of higher education institutions can be found in Chattanooga and nearby. The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is the second largest campus of the University of Tennessee System, with a student population of over 11,587 as of 2017–18 school year. Chattanooga State Community College is a two-year community college with a total undergraduate enrollment of roughly 8150 students in 2018. Tennessee Temple University was a Baptist college located in the Highland Park neighborhood that is no longer operating as of 2015. Chattanooga is also home to a branch of the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, which provides medical education to third- and fourth-year medical students, residents, and other medical professionals in southeast Tennessee through an affiliation with Erlanger Health System. Covenant College, a private liberal arts college operated by the Presbyterian Church in America, is located in the nearby suburb of Lookout Mountain, Georgia, and has a student population of about 1,000. Southern Adventist University is located in the suburb of Collegedale, Tennessee, and enrolls roughly 3,000 students. Richmont Graduate University is a Christian graduate school located in Chattanooga with a CACREP accredited clinical mental health counseling program as well as other ministry related degrees and a student population close to 300. Virginia College School of Business and Health offers a variety of programs leading to diplomas, associate degrees, and bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

===Public library===
The Chattanooga Public Library opened in 1905. Since 1976, the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Bicentennial Library system had been jointly operated by the city and county governments; due to Chattanooga terminating a 1966 agreement with Hamilton County to distribute sales tax revenue equally, the city has taken over full funding responsibilities as of 2011. The city was given a Carnegie library in 1904, and the two-story purpose-built marble structure survives to this day at Eighth Street and Georgia Avenue as commercial office space. In 1939, the library moved to Douglas Street and McCallie Avenue and shared the new building with the John Storrs Fletcher Library of the University of Chattanooga. This building is now called Fletcher Hall and houses classrooms and offices for the university. In 1976, the city library moved to its third and current location at the corner of Tenth and Broad streets.

==Health care==

Chattanooga has three hospital systems: Erlanger Health System, Parkridge Hospital System, and CHI Memorial Hospital System.

Founded in 1889, Erlanger is the seventh largest public healthcare system in the United States with more than half a million patient visits a year. Erlanger Hospital is a non-profit academic teaching center affiliated with the University of Tennessee&#x27;s College of Medicine. Erlanger is also the area&#x27;s primary trauma center, a Level-One Trauma Center for adults, and the only provider of tertiary care for the residents of southeastern Tennessee, north Georgia, northeastern Alabama, and western North Carolina. In 2008, Erlanger was named one of the nation&#x27;s &quot;100 Top teaching hospitals for cardiovascular care&quot; by Thomson Reuters. Erlanger has been operated by the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Hospital Authority since 1976.

Parkridge Hospital is located east of downtown in the Glenwood district and is run by Tri-Star Healthcare. Tri-Star also operates Parkridge East Medical Center in nearby East Ridge.

Memorial Hospital, which is operated by Denver-based Catholic Health Initiatives, is located downtown. In 2004, Memorial was named one of the &quot;100 Top Teaching Hospitals&quot; by Thomson Reuters.

==Transportation==
Considered to be the gateway to the Deep South, along with the Midwest and the Northeast for motorists from states such as Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, Chattanooga&#x27;s extensive transportation infrastructure has evolved into an intricate system of interstates, streets, tunnels, railroad lines, bridges, and a commercial airport. While only a midsize city, Chattanooga is ranked as having some of the worst traffic congestion of cities its size, due primarily to unusually high volumes of truck traffic. A 2015 study by Cambridge Systematics found that 80% of trucks that pass through Chattanooga are destined for a different location, the highest share of any metropolitan area in the country.

===Highways===
Interstate 75 (I-75) connects Chattanooga with Knoxville to the northeast and Atlanta to the south. Interstate 24 (I-24), which to Nashville to the northwest, passes through the central part of the city and reaches its eastern terminus at the 75/24 Split with I-75. The northern terminus of Interstate 59 (I-59) is about southwest of downtown Chattanooga in Dade County, Georgia, and connects the city to Birmingham to the southwest. A controlled-access segment of U.S. Route 27 (US 27) begins at an interchange with I-24 in downtown Chattanooga, and ends in northern Hamilton County, connecting the city with the cities of Red Bank, Soddy Daisy, Dayton, and Dunlap to the north. State Route 153 (SR 153), some of which is controlled-access, is a major route which connects I-75 to US 27 in the eastern and northern parts of the city. A short controlled-access portion of SR 319, known as DuPont Parkway, connects downtown Chattanooga to the Hixson area.

In addition to US 27, several other US Highways pass through Chattanooga as surface streets, and many share concurrencies. They include U.S. Routes 11, 41, 64, 72, 76, and 127, the last three of which have termini in Chattanooga. US 11 and 64 form a concurrency as Brainerd Road and Lee Highway, and connect Chattanooga to Collegedale and Cleveland to the northeast. US 41/76 (Ringgold Road) connects the city to Ringgold, Georgia to the southeast, and a surface-street section of US 27 (Rossville Boulevard) connects to Rossville, Fort Oglethorpe, and LaFayette, all in Georgia, to the south. Beginning in downtown and continuing for several miles to the southwest, US Routes 11, 41, 64, and 72 run together as Cummings Highway, before US 11 splits off, heading toward Trenton, Georgia. The remaining three routes continue toward Jasper, where US 72 splits off headed towards Huntsville, Alabama. US 127 (Signal Mountain Boulevard) begins in North Chattanooga at an interchange with US 27, and connects the city to Signal Mountain and Dunlap to the northwest.

Other major state routes in Chattanooga include routes 17, 58 (Highway 58, Ochs Highway), 148 (Lookout Mountain Scenic Highway), 317 (Bonny Oaks Drive), 319 (Hixson Pike), and 320 (East Brainerd Road). Major city-maintained surface streets include Broad Street, Georgia Avenue, Gunbarrel Road, Hickory Valley Road, McCallie Avenue, Shallowford Road, Dayton Boulevard, and Frazier Avenue.

===Tunnels===
*Bachman Tubes (also unofficially known as The East Ridge Tunnels), which carry Ringgold Road (US 41/76) into the neighboring city of East Ridge.
*Missionary Ridge Tunnels (also unofficially known as McCallie or Brainerd Tunnels), which carry McCallie and Bailey Avenues (US 11/64) through Missionary Ridge where the route continues as Brainerd Road.
*Stringer&#x27;s Ridge Tunnel, which carries Cherokee Boulevard through Stringer&#x27;s Ridge where the route continues as Dayton Boulevard.
*Wilcox Tunnel, which carries Wilcox Boulevard through Missionary Ridge and connects to Shallowford Road.

===Public transit===
The city is served by a publicly run bus company, the Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA). CARTA operates 17 routes, including a free electric shuttle service in the downtown area, and free wireless Internet on certain &quot;smartbuses&quot;.

The Chattanooga Department of Transportation has a mission &quot;to make efficient transportation viable for all commuters- cyclists, pedestrians, transit users, and motorists while enhancing multi-use public spaces for all people.&quot; Chattanooga favors public transit, as the opening lines on the TDOT website read: &quot;Sit back, relax, and let someone else deal with the traffic. Compared to driving, public transportation is less expensive, safer, and better for the environment. It reduces traffic congestion, saves energy, and benefits the communities it serves.&quot;

===Bicycle-sharing system===
The city has its own bicycle transit system (Bike Chattanooga) with 300 bikes and 33 docking stations, all supplied by PBSC Urban Solutions, a Canadian company.

===Railroad lines===

Though Chattanooga&#x27;s most famous connection to the railroad industry is &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot;, a 1941 song made famous by Glenn Miller &amp; His Orchestra, the city serves as a major freight hub with Norfolk Southern (NS) and CSX running trains on their own (and each other&#x27;s) lines. The Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s main classification yard, DeButts Yard, is just east of downtown; Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Shipp&#x27;s Yard and CSX&#x27;s Wauhatchie Yard are southwest of the city. Norfolk Southern maintains a large railroad repair shop in Chattanooga. The two railroad companies are among the largest individual landowners in the city (the Federal Government is another).

The Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum (TVRM), the largest historic operating railroad in the South, and the Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway also provide railroad service in Chattanooga. The headquarters of the National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) were located in Chattanooga next to the TVRM from 1982 to 2013, when the NMRA moved to Soddy-Daisy, a nearby suburb. (The NMRA had moved from Indianapolis, Indiana to Chattanooga.)

Despite the high level of freight rail activity, there is no passenger rail service in the city for commuters or long-distance travelers. But the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) has Chattanooga on a proposed future route that would run from Atlanta to Nashville twice daily, with additional stops in Marietta, GA; Cartersville, GA; Dalton, GA; Bridgeport, AL; Tullahoma, TN; Murfreesboro, TN; and the Nashville International Airport.

Using the AAR reporting marks (NS for Norfolk Southern, CSXT for CSX Transportation, TVRM for the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, TNT for subsidiary Tyner Terminal Railroad, and CCKY for Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway), the rail lines passing through Chattanooga are as follows:
*CSXT – Western &amp; Atlantic Subdivision (Chattanooga to Atlanta)
**Chattanooga Subdivision (Chattanooga to Nashville on former NC&amp;StL trackage)
*NS – Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific, aka the Queen and Crescent Route, (Chattanooga to Cincinnati, Ohio via Lexington, Kentucky)
**Alabama Division (Chattanooga to Memphis via Huntsville, Alabama)
**Alabama Great Southern (Chattanooga to New Orleans, Louisiana via Birmingham, Alabama)
**Georgia Division (Chattanooga to Atlanta)
**Central Division (Chattanooga to Knoxville)
**Chattanooga Traction Company
***North Chattanooga to Signal Mountain
***Dry Valley Line (Red Bank to Lupton City)
*TVRM – East Chattanooga to Grand Junction ()
**East Chattanooga Belt Line Railroad (from near 23rd Street, across to Holtzclaw Avenue and East Chattanooga around North Chamberlain Ave., used by TVRM)
**TNT – Tyner Terminal Railroad (Enterprise South Industrial Park railroad operations)
*CCKY – formerly the Tennessee Alabama &amp; Georgia line (Chattanooga to Hedges, Georgia, abandoned since 2009)
**formerly the Central of Georgia line (Chattanooga to Lyerly, Georgia)

The Lookout Mountain Incline Railway, often referred to as the Incline Railway by locals, serves as a tourist attraction. It is also occasionally used for commuting by Lookout Mountain residents, particularly during wintry weather when traveling up and down the mountain could be very dangerous.

Until the 1960s the Louisville and Nashville railroad ran passenger trains through Union Station and the Southern Railway ran trains through Terminal Station. The last train, the L&amp;N&#x27;s &quot;Georgian&quot;, left Terminal Station in October 1971.

===Bridges===
Being bisected by the Tennessee River, Chattanooga has seven bridges that allow people to traverse the river; five of the bridges being automobile bridges, one a rail bridge, and one a pedestrian bridge. These are the following, from west to east:

* P.R. Olgiati Bridge – Named for a former mayor, P.R. Olgiati, this bridge, which was dedicated in 1959, carries U.S. Highway 27 from downtown towards Dayton, Tennessee and points northward.
* Market Street Bridge – Officially called the John Ross Bridge, this bridge is a bascule bridge, which is a type of draw bridge. The bridge was completed in 1917 for the large sum of $1 million for the time. Having stood for decades since its last major overhaul, the Tennessee Department of Transportation declared it unsafe in late 2004. The bridge was closed in 2005 for a long-overdue renovation and was reopened on August 4, 2007.
* Walnut Street Bridge – Also known as &quot;The Walking Bridge&quot;, it is one of the centerpieces of Chattanooga&#x27;s urban renewal and is the second longest pedestrian bridge in the nation. Constructed in 1891, the bridge was declared unsafe and closed to traffic in 1978. It was on the verge of being demolished in the late 1980s when public outcry led to it being restored as a pedestrian-only span that opened in 1993.
* Veterans Memorial Bridge – Completed in 1984, this bridge has helped commuters from Hixson, Lupton City, and other northern areas reach downtown quickly.
*C.B. Robinson Bridge – Opened in 1981, this bridge carries DuPont Parkway (SR 319) from Amnicola Highway (SR 58) to Hixson Pike and Route 153.
*Tenbridge – This truss bridge with a vertical lift carries the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway over the river and is a popular railfan area. It was constructed in 1920.
*Wilkes T. Thrasher Bridge – Completed in 1955, this route carries Highway 153 over the Chickamauga Dam.

In January 2007, all of the cities above (with the exceptions of Wolfsburg and Tōno) and the former sister cities of Swindon and Ascoli Piceno had a tree native to each locale planted at Coolidge Park&#x27;s Peace Grove, which was established to replace a 100-year-old Slippery elm tree which was damaged in a lightning storm in August 2006. Wolfsburg and Tōno were added in September 2011 and January 2018, respectively. The Peace Grove has nine trees: a linden tree, which represents Hamm; a Chinese elm, which represents Wuxi; a Mediterranean cedar, which represents Givatayim; a white birch, which represents Nizhny Tagil; a ginkgo tree, which represents Gangneung; an English elm, which represents Swindon; a European hornbeam, which represents Ascoli Piceno; an oak tree, which represents Wolfsburg; and a cherry tree, which represents Tōno.

<text>David Mark Winfield (born October 3, 1951) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) right fielder. He is the special assistant to the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Over his 22-year career, he played for six teams: the San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins, and Cleveland Indians. He had the winning hit in the 1992 World Series with the Blue Jays over the Atlanta Braves.

Winfield is a 12-time MLB All-Star, a seven-time Gold Glove Award winner, and a six-time Silver Slugger Award winner. The Padres retired Winfield&#x27;s No. 31 in his honor. He also wore No. 31 while playing for the Yankees and Indians and wore No. 32 with the Angels, Blue Jays and Twins. In 2004, ESPN named him the third-best all-around athlete of all time in any sport. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001 in his first year of eligibility, and was an inaugural inductee into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Early life==
David Mark Winfield was born on October 3, 1951, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and grew up in the city&#x27;s Rondo neighborhood. His parents divorced when he was three years old, leaving him and his older brother Stephen to be raised by their mother, Arline, and a large extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins. The Winfield brothers honed their athletic skills in Saint Paul&#x27;s Oxford Field, where coach Bill Peterson was one of the first to notice Winfield. Winfield did not reach his full height of until his senior year at Saint Paul Central High School.

==College career==
Winfield earned a full baseball scholarship to the University of Minnesota in 1969, where he starred in baseball and basketball for the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Winfield&#x27;s 1971–72 Minnesota team won a Big Ten Conference basketball championship, the school&#x27;s first outright championship in 53 years. During the 1972–73 basketball season, he was involved in a brawl when Ohio State played at Minnesota. Winfield also played college summer baseball for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks for two seasons (1971–72) and was the MVP in 1972. In 1973, he was named All-American and voted MVP of the College World Series—as a pitcher.

Following college, Winfield was drafted by four teams in three different sports. The San Diego Padres selected him as a pitcher with the fourth overall pick in the MLB draft. Winfield was also drafted by the Atlanta Hawks in the 5th round of the 1973 NBA draft and by the Utah Stars in the 6th round of the 1973 ABA Draft. Though he never played college football, the Minnesota Vikings selected Winfield in the 17th round of the 1973 NFL draft. He is one of five players ever to be drafted by three professional sports (the others being George Carter, Noel Jenke, Mickey McCarty and Dave Logan) and one of three athletes, along with Carter and McCarty, to be drafted by four leagues.

==Professional career==
===Draft and San Diego Padres (1973–1980)===

Winfield chose baseball; the San Diego Padres selected him in the first round, with the fourth overall selection, of the 1973 MLB draft. Winfield signed with the Padres, who promoted him directly to the major leagues. Although he was a pitcher, the Padres wanted his powerful bat in the lineup and put him in right field, where he could still use his powerful arm. He batted .277 in 56 games his first season.

Over the next several years, he developed into an All-Star player in San Diego, gradually increasing his ability to hit for both power and average. In 1977, he appeared in his first All-Star game at Yankee Stadium. In 1978, he was named Padres team captain and in , he batted .308 with 34 home runs and 118 RBI. He played one more season with the Padres before becoming a free agent.

===New York Yankees (1981–1990)===
In December 1980, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner made Winfield the game&#x27;s highest-paid player by signing him to a ten-year, $23 million contract (equivalent to $ million in ). Steinbrenner mistakenly thought he was signing Winfield for $16 million, unaware of the meaning of a cost-of-living clause in the contract, a misunderstanding that led to an infamous public feud. The $2.3 million annual average value of the contract set a record. He more than doubled the previous record set when Nolan Ryan signed with the Houston Astros in 1979.

Winfield was among the highest-rated players in the game throughout his Yankee contract. He was a key factor in leading the Yankees to the 1981 American League pennant. In the 1981 American League Division Series, Winfield batted .350 with two doubles and a triple and made some important defensive plays helping the Yankees to victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Unfortunately, Winfield had a sub-par World Series, which the Yankees lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. After getting his only series hit, Winfield jokingly asked for the ball. Steinbrenner did not find this humorous, and criticized Winfield at the end of the series. Many commentators have since noted that Winfield&#x27;s postseason doldrums were somewhat overstated when compared to those of his teammates. Four of his seven hits came in games won by the Yankees. The team&#x27;s offense for the most part was inconsistent, and they were also set back by key injuries to Reggie Jackson and Graig Nettles, who each only played three games with one combined RBI (the same as Winfield).
Winfield did not let Steinbrenner&#x27;s comments affect his play. He hit 37 home runs during the season.

On August 4, , Winfield killed a seagull by throwing a ball while warming up before the fifth inning of a game at Toronto&#x27;s Exhibition Stadium. Fans responded by hurling obscenities and objects onto the field. After the game, he was brought to a nearby Metropolitan Toronto Police station and charged with cruelty to animals. He was released after posting a $500 bond. Yankee manager Billy Martin quipped, &quot;It&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s hit the cutoff man all season.&quot; Charges were dropped the following day. As Winfield missed the Yankees team bus to Hamilton that night to catch their flight home, he was driven to Hamilton personally by Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick. In the offseason, Winfield returned to Toronto and donated two paintings for an Easter Seals auction, which raised over $60,000. For years afterward, Winfield&#x27;s appearances in Toronto were greeted by fans standing and flapping their arms.

From 1981 through , Winfield was the most effective run producer in MLB. In 1984, he and teammate Don Mattingly were in a race for the batting title in which Mattingly won out by .003 points on the last day of the season; Winfield finished with a .340 average. In the last few weeks of the race, it became obvious to most observers that the fans were partial to Mattingly. Winfield took this in stride, noting that a similar thing happened in 1961 when Mantle and Maris competed for the single season home run record.

In 1985, Steinbrenner derided Winfield by saying to &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Murray Chass, &quot;Where is Reggie Jackson? We need a Mr. October or a Mr. September. Winfield is Mr. May.&quot; This criticism has become somewhat of an anachronism as many cite the statement to Steinbrenner after the 1981 World Series. Winfield was struggling while the Yankees eventually lost the division title to Toronto on the second to last day of the season. The &quot;Mr. May&quot; sobriquet lived with Winfield until he won the 1992 World Series with Toronto.

Throughout the late 1980s, Steinbrenner regularly leaked derogatory and fictitious stories about Winfield to the press. He also forced Yankee managers to move him down in the batting order and bench him. Steinbrenner frequently tried to trade him, but Winfield&#x27;s status as a 10-and-5 player (10 years in the majors, five years with a single team) meant he could not be traded without his consent. Winfield continued to put up excellent numbers with the Yankees, driving in 744 runs between 1982 and , and was selected to play in the All-Star Game every season. Winfield won five (of his seven) Gold Glove Awards for his stellar outfield play as a Yankee.

In 1989, Winfield missed the entire season due to a back injury. was the last year of his contract with the Yankees, but the troubles with Steinbrenner in his feud with Winfield continued to escalate. He had a rusty spring training before being relegated from the field to being the designated hitter. Further troubles led to being just the DH against left-handed pitchers. On May 11, manager Bucky Dent and general manager Pete Peterson met in a room with the intent of stating a trade of Winfield for Mike Witt of the California Angels. Winfield stepped in the room and stated his refusal to be traded; the argument over whether his 10-and-5 rights overrode his list of having the Angels on his trade list failed to meet at an impasse when Angels owner Gene Autry came in with a three-year extension. He proceeded to hit 19 home runs in 112 games for the Angels in the remainder of the 1990 season. As for Steinbrenner, he attempted to curry favor by stating to Winfield that he would welcome back Winfield openly if he had won the arbitration case; by this point in the month of May, he was already under investigation by commissioner Fay Vincent for his apparent connections to Howard Spira, a known gambler with supposed Mafia connections, whom he had paid $40,000 for embarrassing information on Winfield. A month later, the team received a fine that required them to pay money to the league and the Angels for tampering and Steinbrenner soon received a life-time ban. However, the suspension lasted only two years.

===California Angels (1990–1991)===
Winfield was traded for Mike Witt during the 1990 season and won &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Comeback Player of the Year Award. He hit for the cycle in June 1991 against the Kansas City Royals, hitting 5-for-5 in the game. He also recorded his 400th home run against the Twins in his hometown.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1992)===
Winfield was still a productive hitter after his 40th birthday. On December 19, , he signed with the Toronto Blue Jays as their designated hitter, and also made &quot;Winfieldian&quot; plays when he periodically took his familiar position in right field. He batted .290 with 26 home runs and 108 RBI during the season.

Winfield proved to be a lightning rod for the Blue Jays, providing leadership and experience as well as his potent bat. Winfield was a fan favorite and also demanded fan participation. In August 1992, he made an impassioned plea to the reserved fans during an interview for more crowd noise. The phrase &quot;Winfield Wants Noise&quot; became a popular slogan for the rest of the season, appearing on T-shirts, dolls, buttons, and signs.

The Blue Jays won the pennant, giving Winfield a chance at redemption for his previous post-season futility. In Game 6 of the World Series, he became &quot;Mr. Jay&quot; as he delivered the game-winning two-run double in the 11th inning off Atlanta&#x27;s Charlie Leibrandt to win the World Series Championship for Toronto. At 41 years of age, Winfield became the third-oldest player to hit an extra base hit in the World Series, trailing only Pete Rose and Enos Slaughter.

===Minnesota Twins (1993–1994)===
After the 1992 season, Winfield was granted free agency and signed with his hometown Minnesota Twins. In 1993, he batted .271 with 21 home runs, appearing in 143 games for the Twins, mostly as their designated hitter. On September 16, 1993, at age 41, he collected his 3,000th career hit with a single off Oakland Athletics closer Dennis Eckersley.

During the 1994 baseball strike, which began on August 12, Winfield was traded to the Cleveland Indians at the trade waiver deadline on August 31 for a player to be named later. The 1994 season had been halted two weeks earlier (it was eventually canceled a month later on September 14), so Winfield did not get to play for the Indians that year and no player was ever named in exchange. To settle the trade, Cleveland and Minnesota executives went to dinner, with the Indians picking up the tab. This makes Winfield the only player in major league history to be &quot;traded&quot; for a dinner (although official sources list the transaction as Winfield having been sold by the Twins to the Indians).

===Cleveland Indians (1995)===
Winfield, who was the oldest player in MLB at the time, was again granted free agency in October but re-signed with the Indians as spring training began in April . A rotator cuff injury kept him on the disabled list for most of the season, thus he played in only 46 games and hit .191 for Cleveland&#x27;s first pennant winner in 41 years. He did not participate in the Indians&#x27; postseason.

===Honors and awards===

Winfield retired in and, in his first year of eligibility, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in as a San Diego Padre, the first Padre to be so honored. The move reportedly irked Yankees&#x27; owner George Steinbrenner, however Winfield sounded a conciliatory note toward him, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s said he regrets a lot of things that happened. We&#x27;re fine now. Things have changed.&quot;

In 1998, Winfield was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame, honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

In , Winfield ranked number 94 on &quot;The Sporting News list of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot;, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

He was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 2000. The Padres retired Winfield&#x27;s No. 31 on April 14, 2001.

On July 4, , Winfield was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in its inaugural class.

In 2010, Winfield was selected as one of 28 members of the NCAA Men&#x27;s College World Series Legends Team.

The Big Ten Network named Winfield its #15 ranked Big Ten Conference &quot;Icon&quot; in 2010.

The 2016 MLB All-Star Game, played at Petco Park in San Diego, was dedicated to Winfield. He had represented the Padres at the first All-Star Game to be played in San Diego.

On June 21, 2024, Winfield returned to Fairbanks for the unveiling of a bronze statue near Growden Park, where he had played for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks. Winfield also threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the annual Midnight Sun Game.

==Post-playing career and appearances==
In 1996, Winfield joined the new Major League Baseball on Fox program as studio analyst for their Saturday MLB coverage.

From 2001 to 2013, Winfield served as executive vice president/senior advisor of the San Diego Padres.

In 2006, Winfield teamed up with conductor Bob Thompson to create The Baseball Music Project, a series of concerts that celebrate the history of baseball, with Winfield serving as host and narrator.

In 2008, Winfield participated in both the final Old Timers&#x27; Day ceremony and final game ceremony at Yankee Stadium.

On June 5, , Major League Baseball held a special draft of the surviving Negro league players to acknowledge and rectify their exclusion from the major leagues on the basis of race. The idea of the special draft was conceived by Winfield. Each major league team drafted one player from the Negro leagues.

On March 31, 2009, Winfield joined ESPN as an analyst on their &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; program.

On December 5, 2013, Winfield was named special assistant to Executive Director Tony Clark at the Major League Baseball Players Association.

On July 14, 2014, Winfield returned to Minnesota to throw out the first pitch at the 2014 Home Run Derby along with fellow St. Paul natives Joe Mauer, Paul Molitor, and Jack Morris.

In March 2016, Winfield helped represent Major League Baseball in Cuba during President Obama&#x27;s trip to the island in an attempt to help normalize relations. On March 21 he gave a press conference with Joe Torre, Derek Jeter, and Luis Tiant in Havana and attended the baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuba National Team the next day.

In July 2022, Winfield delivered Bud Fowler&#x27;s Hall of Fame speech in Cooperstown.

==In popular media==
On Thanksgiving Day 1981, Winfield sang &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot; atop the Big Apple Float at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

In 1985, the video game &quot;Dave Winfield&#x27;s Batter Up!&quot; was released on computers by Avant-Garde, a producer of interactive educational software. The game featured a 55-page manual co-authored by Winfield and was marketed as an educational tool aimed to teach players about batting. The game was conceived after Winfield was seated next to an Avant-Garde investor on a cross-country flight.

During the 1994–95 MLB strike, Winfield and a handful of other striking players appeared as themselves in the November 27, 1994, episode of &quot;Married With Children&quot; (Season 9, Episode 11).

==Activism==
===Philanthropy===
Well known for his philanthropic work, Winfield was the first active athlete to create a philanthropic foundation, The David M. Winfield Foundation. He began giving back to the communities in which he played from 1973, his first year with the Padres, when he began buying blocks of tickets to Padres games for families who could not afford to go to games, in a program known as &quot;pavilions.&quot; Winfield then added health clinics to the equation, by partnering with San Diego&#x27;s Scripps Clinic who had a mobile clinic which was brought into the stadium parking lot. When Winfield joined the Toronto Blue Jays, he learned teammate David Wells was one of the &quot;Winfield kids&quot; who attended Padres games.

In his hometown of St. Paul, he began a scholarship program (which continues to this day). In 1977, he organized his efforts into an official 501(c)(3) charitable organization known as the David M. Winfield Foundation for Underprivileged Youth. As his salary increased, Foundation programs expanded to include holiday dinner giveaways and national scholarships. In 1978, San Diego hosted the All-Star game, and Winfield bought his usual block of pavilion tickets. Winfield then went on a local radio station and inadvertently invited &quot;all the kids of San Diego&quot; to attend. To accommodate the unexpected crowd, the Foundation brought the kids into batting practice. The All-Star open-practice has since been adopted by Major League Baseball and continues to this day.

When Winfield joined the New York Yankees, he set aside $3 million of his contracted salary for the Winfield Foundation. The foundation created a partnership with the Hackensack University Medical Center including founding The Dave Winfield Nutrition Center, near his Teaneck, New Jersey, home. The Foundation also partnered with Merck Pharmaceuticals and created an internationally acclaimed bilingual substance abuse prevention program called &quot;Turn it Around&quot;.
The Winfield Foundation also became a bone of contention in Steinbrenner&#x27;s public feud with Winfield. Steinbrenner alleged that the foundation was mishandling funds and often held back payments to the organization, which resulted in long, costly court battles. It also created the appearance that Steinbrenner was contributing to the foundation, when in actuality, Steinbrenner was holding back a portion of Winfield&#x27;s salary. Ultimately, the foundation received all of its funding and the alleged improprieties proved unfounded.

Winfield&#x27;s philanthropic endeavors had as much influence on many of MLB&#x27;s players as his on-field play. Yankee Derek Jeter, who grew up idolizing Winfield for both his athleticism and humanitarianism, credits Winfield as the inspiration for his own Turn 2 Foundation. In turn, Winfield continues to help raise funds and awareness for Jeter&#x27;s Foundation and for many other groups and causes throughout the country.

==Personal life==
Winfield resides in California with his wife Tonya, and three children, Shanel and twins David II and Arielle.

<text>The Caledonian Railway (Brechin) Ltd is a private limited company formed by a group of steam railway enthusiasts, the Brechin Railway Preservation Society, with the object of operating a railway service on the former Caledonian Railway line between Brechin and Montrose, Angus, Scotland. This line was built by the Aberdeen Railway in the 1840s. It closed for passenger traffic during the early 1950s with final closure undertaken by British Rail in 1981.

==Brechin to Bridge of Dun==
The line has now been re-instated and preserved for between Brechin railway station and Bridge of Dun railway station and since 1993 trains have run at weekends during the summer as well as on special occasions at other times of the year. The two railway stations have also been refurbished.

Although the line originally went all the way to Montrose, which is still a station on the main rail network, there are currently no immediate plans to link the Brechin line back into the main rail network, as the section at Dubton through and onto Kinnaber Junction close to Montrose itself has now been redeveloped, making it difficult for the preserved railway to be reconnected to the national network at all.

==Proposed extension==
However, there is still hope of seeing the &quot;CR Brechin&quot; extended a further to Dubton, bringing it up to a total of in length. This is a long-term aim which would only require the re-instatement of a short length of track.

<doc id="102803" wikidata="Q239581" url="?curid=102803" title="Noumenon">
<text>In philosophy, a noumenon (, ; from ; : noumena) is knowledge posited as an object that exists independently of human sense. The term &quot;noumenon&quot; is generally used in contrast with, or in relation to, the term &quot;phenomenon&quot;, which refers to any object of the senses. Immanuel Kant first developed the notion of the noumenon as part of his transcendental idealism, suggesting that while we know the noumenal world to exist because human sensibility is merely receptive, it is not itself sensible and must therefore remain otherwise unknowable to us. In Kantian philosophy, the noumenon is often associated with the unknowable &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; (). However, the nature of the relationship between the two is not made explicit in Kant&#x27;s work, and remains a subject of debate among Kant scholars as a result.

==Etymology==
The Greek word (plural ) is the neuter middle-passive present participle of , which in turn originates from the word , an Attic contracted form of . A rough equivalent in English would be &quot;that which is thought&quot;, or &quot;the object of an act of thought&quot;.

==Historical predecessors==
The Indian Vedānta philosophy (specifically Advaita), the roots of which go back to the Vedic period, talks of the ātman (self) in similar terms as the noumenon.

Regarding the equivalent concepts in Plato, Ted Honderich writes: &quot;Platonic Ideas and Forms are noumena, and phenomena are things displaying themselves to the senses... This dichotomy is the most characteristic feature of Plato&#x27;s dualism; that noumena and the noumenal world are objects of the highest knowledge, truths, and values is Plato&#x27;s principal legacy to philosophy.&quot;

==Kantian noumena==

===Overview===
As expressed in Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason,&quot; human understanding is structured by &quot;concepts of the understanding&quot; or pure categories of understanding, found prior to experience in the mind and which make outer experiences possible as counterpart to the rational faculties of the mind.

By Kant&#x27;s account, when one employs a concept to describe or categorize &quot;noumena&quot; (the objects of inquiry, investigation or analysis of the workings of the world), one is also employing a way of describing or categorizing &quot;phenomena&quot; (the observable manifestations of those objects of inquiry, investigation or analysis). Kant posited methods by which human understanding makes sense of and thus intuits phenomena that appear to the mind: the concepts of the &quot;transcendental aesthetic&quot;, as well as that of the &quot;transcendental analytic&quot;, &quot;transcendental logic&quot; and &quot;transcendental deduction&quot;. Taken together, Kant&#x27;s &quot;categories of understanding&quot; are the principles of the human mind which necessarily are brought to bear in attempting to understand the world in which we exist (that is, to understand, or attempt to understand, &quot;things in themselves&quot;). In each instance the word &quot;transcendental&quot; refers to the process that the human mind must exercise to understand or grasp the form of, and order among, phenomena. Kant asserts that to &quot;transcend&quot; a direct observation or experience is to use reason and classifications to strive to correlate with the phenomena that are observed. Humans can make sense out of phenomena in these various ways, but in doing so can never know the &quot;things-in-themselves&quot;, the actual objects and dynamics of the natural world in their noumenal dimension - this being the negative, correlate to phenomena and that which escapes the limits of human understanding. By Kant&#x27;s Critique, our minds may attempt to correlate in useful ways, perhaps even closely accurate ways, with the structure and order of the various aspects of the universe, but cannot know these &quot;things-in-themselves&quot; (noumena) directly. Rather, we must infer the extent to which the human rational faculties can reach the object of &quot;things-in-themselves&quot; by our observations of the manifestations of those things that can be perceived via the physical senses, that is, of phenomena, and by ordering these perceptions in the mind help infer the validity of our perceptions to the rational categories used to understand them in a rational system. This rational system (&quot;transcendental analytic&quot;), being the categories of the understanding as free from empirical contingency.

According to Kant, objects of which we are cognizant via the physical senses are merely representations of &quot;unknown somethings&quot;—what Kant refers to as the &quot;transcendental object&quot;—as interpreted through the &quot;a priori&quot; or &quot;categories of the understanding&quot;. These &quot;unknown somethings&quot; are manifested within the noumenon—although we can never know how or why as our perceptions of these &quot;unknown somethings&quot; via our physical senses are bound by the limitations of the &quot;categories of the understanding&quot; and we are therefore never able to fully know the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;.

===Noumenon and the thing-in-itself===

Many accounts of Kant&#x27;s philosophy treat &quot;noumenon&quot; and &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; as synonymous, and there is textual evidence for this relationship. However, Stephen Palmquist holds that &quot;noumenon&quot; and &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; are only &quot;loosely&quot; synonymous, inasmuch as they represent the same concept viewed from two different perspectives, and other scholars also argue that they are not identical. Schopenhauer criticised Kant for changing the meaning of &quot;noumenon&quot;. However, this opinion is far from unanimous. Kant&#x27;s writings show points of difference between noumena and things-in-themselves. For instance, he regards things-in-themselves as existing:
...though we cannot know these objects as things in themselves, we must yet be in a position at least to think them as things in themselves; otherwise we should be landed in the absurd conclusion that there can be appearance without anything that appears.
He is much more doubtful about noumena:

But in that case a noumenon is not for our understanding a special [kind of] object, namely, an intelligible object; the [sort of] understanding to which it might belong is itself a problem. For we cannot in the least represent to ourselves the possibility of an understanding which should know its object, not discursively through categories, but intuitively in a non-sensible intuition.
A crucial difference between the noumenon and the thing-in-itself is that to call something a noumenon is to claim a kind of knowledge, whereas Kant insisted that the thing-in-itself is unknowable. Interpreters have debated whether the latter claim makes sense: it seems to imply that we know at least one thing about the thing-in-itself (i.e., that it is unknowable). But Stephen Palmquist explains that this is part of Kant&#x27;s definition of the term, to the extent that anyone who claims to have found a way of making the thing-in-itself knowable must be adopting a non-Kantian position.

===Positive and negative noumena===
Kant also makes a distinction between &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; noumena:

If by &#x27;noumenon&#x27; we mean a thing so far as it is not an object of our sensible intuition, and so abstract from our mode of intuiting it, this is a noumenon in the &quot;negative&quot; sense of the term.

But if we understand by it an object of a non-sensible intuition, we thereby presuppose a special mode of intuition, namely, the intellectual, which is not that which we possess, and of which we cannot comprehend even the possibility. This would be &#x27;noumenon&#x27; in the &quot;positive&quot; sense of the term.
The positive noumena, if they existed, would be immaterial entities that can only be apprehended by a special, non-sensory faculty: &quot;intellectual intuition&quot; (&quot;nicht sinnliche Anschauung&quot;). Kant doubts that we have such a faculty, because for him intellectual intuition would mean that thinking of an entity, and its being represented, would be the same. He argues that humans have no way to apprehend positive noumena:
Since, however, such a type of intuition, intellectual intuition, forms no part whatsoever of our faculty of knowledge, it follows that the employment of the categories can never extend further than to the objects of experience. Doubtless, indeed, there are intelligible entities corresponding to the sensible entities; there may also be intelligible entities to which our sensible faculty of intuition has no relation whatsoever; but our concepts of understanding, being mere forms of thought for our sensible intuition, could not in the least apply to them. That, therefore, which we entitle &#x27;noumenon&#x27; must be understood as being such only in a negative sense.
===The noumenon as a limiting concept===
Even if noumena are unknowable, they are still needed as a &quot;limiting concept&quot;, Kant tells us. Without them, there would be only phenomena, and since potentially we have complete knowledge of our phenomena, we would in a sense know everything. In his own words:
Further, the concept of a noumenon is necessary, to prevent sensible intuition from being extended to things in themselves, and thus to limit the objective validity of sensible knowledge.
What our understanding acquires through this concept of a noumenon, is a negative extension; that is to say, understanding is not limited through sensibility; on the contrary, it itself limits sensibility by applying the term noumena to things in themselves (things not regarded as appearances). But in so doing it at the same time sets limits to itself, recognising that it cannot know these noumena through any of the categories, and that it must therefore think them only under the title of an unknown something.
Furthermore, for Kant, the existence of a noumenal world limits reason to what he perceives to be its proper bounds, making many questions of traditional metaphysics, such as the existence of God, the soul, and free will unanswerable by reason. Kant derives this from his definition of knowledge as &quot;the determination of given representations to an object&quot;. As there are no appearances of these entities in the phenomenal, Kant is able to make the claim that they cannot be known to a mind that works upon &quot;such knowledge that has to do only with appearances&quot;. These questions are ultimately the &quot;proper object of faith, but not of reason&quot;.

===The dual-object and dual-aspect interpretations===
Kantian scholars have long debated two contrasting interpretations of the thing-in-itself. One is the &quot;dual object&quot; view, according to which the thing-in-itself is an entity distinct from the phenomena to which it gives rise. The other is the &quot;dual aspect&quot; view, according to which the thing-in-itself and the thing-as-it-appears are two &quot;sides&quot; of the same thing. This view is supported by the textual fact that &quot;Most occurrences of the phrase &#x27;things-in-themselves&#x27; are shorthand for the phrase, &#x27;things considered in themselves&#x27; (Dinge an sich selbst betrachtet).&quot;
Although we cannot &quot;see&quot; things apart from the way we do in fact perceive them via the physical senses, we can &quot;think&quot; them apart from our mode of sensibility (physical perception); thus making the thing-in-itself a kind of noumenon or object of thought.

==Criticisms of Kant&#x27;s noumenon==

===Pre-Kantian critique===
Though the term &quot;noumenon&quot; did not come into common usage until Kant, the idea that undergirds it, that matter has an absolute existence which causes it to emanate certain phenomena, had historically been subjected to criticism. George Berkeley, who pre-dated Kant, asserted that matter, independent of an observant mind, is metaphysically impossible. Qualities associated with matter, such as shape, color, smell, texture, weight, temperature, and sound are all dependent on minds, which allow only for relative perception, not absolute perception. The complete absence of such minds (and more importantly an omnipotent mind) would render those same qualities unobservable and even unimaginable. Berkeley called this philosophy immaterialism. Essentially there could be no such thing as matter without a mind.

===Schopenhauer&#x27;s critique===
Schopenhauer claimed that Kant used the word &quot;noumenon&quot; incorrectly. He explained in his &quot;Critique of the Kantian philosophy&quot;, which first appeared as an appendix to &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;:

The difference between abstract and intuitive cognition, which Kant entirely overlooks, was the very one that ancient philosophers indicated as φαινόμενα [&quot;phainomena&quot;] and νοούμενα [&quot;nooumena&quot;]; the opposition and incommensurability between these terms proved very productive in the philosophemes of the Eleatics, in Plato&#x27;s doctrine of Ideas, in the dialectic of the Megarics, and later in the scholastics, in the conflict between nominalism and realism. This latter conflict was the late development of a seed already present in the opposed tendencies of Plato and Aristotle. But Kant, who completely and irresponsibly neglected the issue for which the terms φαινομένα and νοούμενα were already in use, then took possession of the terms as if they were stray and ownerless, and used them as designations of things in themselves and their appearances.
The noumenon&#x27;s original meaning of &quot;that which is thought&quot; is not compatible with the &quot;thing-in-itself,&quot; the latter being Kant&#x27;s term for things as they exist apart from their existence as images in the mind of an observer. In a footnote to this passage, Schopenhauer provides the following passage from the &quot;Outlines of Pyrrhonism&quot; (Bk. I, ch. 13) of Sextus Empiricus to demonstrate the original distinction between phenomenon and noumenon according to ancient philosophers: νοούμενα φαινομένοις ἀντετίθη Ἀναξαγόρας (&#x27;Anaxagoras opposed what is thought to what appears.&#x27;)

<text>Filmation Associates was an American production company founded by Lou Scheimer, Hal Sutherland and Norm Prescott in 1962, before closing by Group W Productions on February 3, 1989. Located in Reseda, California, Filmation produced animated and live-action productions.

Notable productions that the company produced include the DC Comics and Archie Comics animated adaptations, &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, the animated version of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and the two adaptations of the Mattel toyline &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; and &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;).

== History ==
=== Background ===
Lou Scheimer and Filmation&#x27;s main director Hal Sutherland met in 1957 while working at Larry Harmon Pictures on the made-for-TV &quot;Bozo&quot; and &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons. Eventually Larry Harmon closed the studio by 1961. Scheimer and Sutherland went to work at a small company called True Line, one of whose owners was Marcus Lipsky, who then owned Reddi-wip whipped cream. SIB Productions, a Japanese firm with U.S. offices in Chicago, approached them about producing a cartoon called &quot;Rod Rocket&quot;. The two agreed to take on the work and also took on a project for Family Films, owned by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, for ten short animated films based on the life of Christ. Paramount Pictures soon purchased SIB Productions, and True Line&#x27;s staff increased, including the arrival of former radio disc jockey Norm Prescott, who became a partner in the firm. He had already been working on the animated feature &quot;Pinocchio in Outer Space&quot; which was primarily produced by Belvision Studios.

=== Peak era ===
They eventually left True Line, and Scheimer began working on commercials, including for Gillette and others, which began what became Filmation. He met lawyer Ira Epstein, who had worked for Harmon but had left the firm, and now put together the new corporation with Scheimer and Sutherland. It officially became Filmation Associates as of September 1962, so named because &quot;We were working on film, but doing animation&quot;; so putting them together yielded the portmanteau &quot;Filmation&quot;.

Both &quot;Rod Rocket&quot; and the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; series credited &quot;Filmation Associates&quot; with &quot;Production Design&quot; in addition to Scheimer and Sutherland as directors. (SIB Productions, whose logo bore a resemblance to the original Filmation logo designed by Ted Littlefield, would soon go on to become &quot;Sib-Tower 12 Productions&quot; and produce the first few of Chuck Jones&#x27; &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; films for MGM, until becoming MGM Animation/Visual Arts for the remainder of the films).

Norm Prescott brought in Filmation&#x27;s first major project, &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot;, an animated sequel to the MGM film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). Begun in 1962, storyboarding, voice recording, and most of the music scoring and animation had been completed when financial challenges caused the project to be put on hold for nearly eight years.

In the meantime, the new Filmation studio turned their attention to a more successful medium, network television. For the next few years they made television commercials and some other projects for other companies and made an unsuccessful pilot film for a Marx Brothers cartoon series. They also tried to develop an original series named &quot;The Adventures of Stanley Stoutheart&quot; (later renamed &quot;Yank and Doodle&quot;) about a boy and a dog, but they were never able to sell it and almost closed down; until approached by DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger to do a &quot;Superman&quot; cartoon that premiered on CBS on September 10, 1966. This was followed by several of the other DC superheroes, and then, in 1968, the first &quot;Archie Show&quot;. Both series greatly helped Filmation&#x27;s popularity to increase into the 1970s, when it scored big with several of its series.

The Filmation studio was purchased by the TelePrompTer Corporation in 1969. Two years later, in 1971, Filmation and Warner Bros. signed an agreement to distribute cartoons for film and television.

=== Final years ===
In 1981, while Prescott left the company, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, through its Group W Productions division, acquired Filmation along with its purchase of TelePrompTer&#x27;s cable and entertainment properties. 

The last shows produced by Filmation were &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;BraveStarr&quot;, and the company&#x27;s last production was the feature film &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; (a sequel to the story of Snow White); this film was produced from 1986 to 1988, and was theatrically released in the United States five years later, in 1993. Also, at the time of the closing, two new animated series, &quot;Bugzburg&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night&quot;, concerning insect characters who had shown up in that movie) and &quot;Bravo&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;BraveStarr&quot;), were beginning production.

In 1989, Westinghouse sold Filmation to Paravision International, an investment consortium led by the French cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal. Before that sale was complete, Westinghouse shuttered the film studio on February 3, 1989, which left L&#x27;Oréal with only the Filmation library. This happened a day before the WARN Act went into effect requiring companies to give employees 60 days&#x27; notice before a mass layoff.

== Production ==
=== Animation style ===
Like other producers of Saturday-morning cartoons, Filmation was more concerned with quantity rather than quality; however, it did make a number of attempts to rise above the standard animated fare and produce reasonably well-written cartoons. The best-known example of this is its animated adaptation &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, which included scripts contributed by well-known science fiction writers and starred most of the original cast. Other favorably remembered Filmation series included a 16-part animated serial of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, originally intended as a movie for theatrical release, &quot;Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All&quot;. The original film edit was only aired three times on NBC, years after the series was cancelled. &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; was another hailed series created by and starring Bill Cosby with an explicit educational focus. &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, based on the popular line of Mattel toys, opened up a new North American market for first-run television syndication for animation in the 1980s. The animated adaptations of the Archie Comics characters were also noteworthy for the original pop music produced for it, particularly the song &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot;, which was a No. 1 hit single.

In addition, certain episodes of &quot;He-Man&quot; and &quot;BraveStarr&quot;, in substance, and often animation, were pioneers in children&#x27;s animated series of their time and paved the way for broader storytelling. Examples include He-Man&#x27;s &quot;The Problem with Power&quot; which dealt with He-Man believing he had killed an innocent bystander. Another is &quot;Teela&#x27;s Quest&quot; which introduced a now-famous mythology on the Sorceress being Teela&#x27;s mother, who is thus the heir to the mantle of safeguarding Grayskull, the versed continuity shared between He-Man and She-Ra, among others. Other notable examples include the &quot;BraveStarr&quot; episode &quot;The Price&quot;, which includes the death of a character due to drug addiction. The 1985 &quot;Fat Albert&quot; episode &quot;Busted&quot; was a direct homage to the primetime &quot;Scared Straight!&quot; specials. A first for American children&#x27;s cartoons, the original airing of this episode included mild profanity that has, however, been edited out of re-airings and home video versions. Likewise, the scripts for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which were often written by the same people who had written for the live-action version of the series, tended to be quite sophisticated, and garnered the first Emmy Award for the franchise.

==== Quality ====
Filmation had a reputation for exploiting the technique of limited animation to produce a number of animated series with a distinct look. This technique involved limiting of the number of frames per second (fps) to fewer than the standard 24 fps seen on film or 25/30 fps seen on video. Frames would be repeated to compensate for the deficiency, resulting in a &quot;jerky&quot; motion. Filmation also made heavy use of rotoscoping in later years (beginning with its &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; series). It also re-used the same animated sequences over and over, many times, to the point where the Filmation style was instantly recognizable. One example of this can be seen in She-Ra&#x27;s and He-Man&#x27;s transformation sequences.

This frequent use of stock footage saved production money, but often resulted in sacrifice of continuity. This was countered by cutting from one stock shot to another after only a second or two, long enough to set the scene but before the eye could notice all of the unexplained errors. This became part of the Filmation style during a period when most television and motion picture productions tended to run minimum shots of 4–5 seconds.

In contrast to the rapid jump cuts during action sequences, another Filmation trademark was the recurring use of long establishing shots in which the camera would pan slowly across a very wide background painting, thus filling up screen time with sequences requiring little or no animation. Filmation also pioneered other animation technologies, particularly in &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, which included backlighting effects for the first time in American animation (they were already in use in Japan), including moire effects to represent energy fields (a technique that was later used in &quot;He-Man&quot; and in &quot;She-Ra&quot;). It also pioneered a unique method of generating 3-D vehicle animation by filming white-outlined black miniatures against black backgrounds using a computerized motion-control camera and high-contrast film, then printing the negatives onto acetate frame-by-frame, to create animation cels which were then hand-painted. This produced a three-dimensional effect that had been used by Disney in films such as &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; previously. It predated the modern use of 3-D computer animation for vehicles in 2-D animated productions. However, it had a distinctive &quot;flicker&quot; to it, because some of the painted lines went in and out of visibility as the miniatures moved.

Unlike many American studios, Filmation never relied on animation studios outside the United States for the bulk of its production; &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;BraveStarr&quot; both state in the ending credits that they were &quot;made entirely in the U.S.A.&quot; This occurred during a time when rival studio Hanna-Barbera shifted from saying in the final production credits (immediately before the production logo appearances) &quot;A Hanna-Barbera Production&quot; to &quot;Produced in Association with: Wang Film Productions / Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest Studios&quot; which is located in Taiwan (along with H-B&#x27;s own Philippines-based Fil-Cartoons). The quality of Filmation&#x27;s &quot;Made Entirely in the U.S.A.&quot; strategy was comparable to the outsourced animation. Filmation did, however, rely on outsourcing once, when the company created its animated &quot;Zorro&quot; series. It was animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsha of Japan; however, the storyboards and graphics were made by Filmation itself.

Filmation is also noteworthy for its background paintings under the direction of long-time department head Erv Kaplan, such as the purple-colored &quot;night sky&quot; backgrounds used in &quot;He-Man&quot; and &quot;She-Ra&quot;.

Characters, as well as plots, were typically run-of-the-mill for the time. For example, most episodes of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had the same scheme (bad guys develop an evil plan, the heroes are needed but always absent, Ghost Buggy the talking car complains about their dangerous position, Tracy the Gorilla pulls out of his back pack exactly the miscellaneous item the Ghostbuster needs in a moment of despair, Eddie doing a number of clumsy/stupid things, etc.); although as previously mentioned, Filmation made various attempts to rise above the norm. Many of the sound effects used in its cartoons are also very familiar, the majority of them being recycled from Hanna-Barbera (this was, and still is, a common trait among animation companies, though Filmation&#x27;s copies of the Hanna-Barbera sound effects were of a distinctively lower quality), though the company&#x27;s DC Comics cartoons of 1966–67 used more realistic sound effects.

Filmation received particular criticism for &quot;Lassie&#x27;s Rescue Rangers&quot;, an animated continuation of the long-running live-action series &quot;Lassie&quot;. Lassie&#x27;s co-creator and trainer, Rudd Weatherwax, said of the show: &quot;That&#x27;s not Lassie. That&#x27;s trash.&quot; It drew a rare denunciation from the National Association of Broadcasters, which accused Filmation of corrupting the &quot;Lassie&quot; franchise with &quot;violence, crime and stupidity.&quot;

=== Trademarks ===
A trademark of the company&#x27;s productions, beginning in 1969, was a rotating, circular &quot;Produced by&quot; (and on some series, &quot;Executive Producers&quot;) credit seen in the ending credits (and in later productions, the opening sequences) of Filmation programs, as a device that was supposedly created to allow Prescott and Scheimer to share equal billing. Previously, Scheimer&#x27;s name had been placed above Prescott&#x27;s. However, the later Filmation productions credited only Scheimer, in the form of his signature (&quot;Lou Scheimer, (Executive) Producer&quot;), starting with &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; (1982).

Many of its series—particularly the productions of the late 1970s and 1980s—are notable for imparting a simple moral or life-lesson (explained by a key character, in a child-friendly manner) in the epilogue.

=== Original characters ===
The studio created very few original animated characters. Two examples were Fraidy Cat, a timid feline who has lost eight of his nine lives, which come back to haunt him; and Wacky and Packy, a caveman and his pet mammoth (Packy refers to the latter character being a &quot;pachyderm&quot;) who enter the modern age through a time warp. Both of these originally aired as segments of the &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot; series on ABC (hosted by Charles Nelson Reilly). In a period where comedy in cartoons was heavily scrutinized for violence and many shows duplicated the popular &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; format, Filmation&#x27;s strong point was its adaptations of popular television series, movies and other works, although at least one series, &quot;M*U*S*H&quot; (the first animated segment on &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;), while not a direct adaptation, was inspired by the film (and later TV series) &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. &quot;M*U*S*H&quot; is an acronym for Mangy Unwanted Shabby Heroes since all the character were dogs stationed in the Arctic.

== Film library ownership ==
The studio&#x27;s intellectual property assets have changed hands on a number of occasions. The in-house productions (&quot;The Archie Show&quot;, &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, etc.), which form a majority of the Filmation back catalog, were sold to Hallmark Cards in 1995, and were managed by its Hallmark Entertainment subsidiary. However, since the rest of Filmation&#x27;s output was based on characters licensed from other companies, such titles are under the control of other studios (such as CBS Media Ventures and Warner Bros. via Turner Entertainment Co. and DC Entertainment).

In March 2004, ownership of the Filmation in-house library, which was under the ownership of Hallmark, was sold to UK-based Entertainment Rights. Entertainment Rights has since made the revelation that when Hallmark converted all of its Filmation series to digital format in the 1990s, only PAL-format copies were made, with the original film negatives and print rolls apparently discarded, as well as the original sound masters and other archival material belonging to Filmation. This was due to Hallmark&#x27;s previously unstated (but long-suspected) short-sighted policy of only distributing Filmation&#x27;s in-house shows outside of the United States. As a result, many of Entertainment Rights&#x27; DVD releases (distributed by BCI Eclipse LLC in the United States prior to the latter company&#x27;s folding) were based on the international versions (which have PAL prints).

Because they were taken from PAL-based transfers, without correction, these releases exhibit the so-called 576i speedup effect in which the soundtrack plays 4% too fast, which results in the pitch being a half-step higher than it was originally (see PAL and Telecine for more information). PAL-NTSC conversion artifacts also include softness and ghosting. The exception appears to be at least three titles from ER&#x27;s library: &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot;, &quot;Ark II&quot; and the animated &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; series. These series appear to have been sourced from original NTSC transfers for their U.S. release by BCI. The live-action series was, unlike most Filmation shows, shot on NTSC format tape (rather than film), so even if those did come from PAL masters, they would not have exhibited 576i speedup, as that only applies to material sourced from film masters. Other exceptions included the shows which were licensed properties, such as &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, which was owned by Paramount Television (now CBS Studios, which is now part of Paramount Global since 2019), and &quot;Shazam!&quot; (owned by Warner Bros./DC Comics), because the master elements for those shows were turned over to the owners of those licensed properties years before the sale to Hallmark.

On April 1, 2009, it was announced that Entertainment Rights would be acquired by Boomerang Media and on May 11, 2009, it was announced that the subsidiaries and offices of Entertainment Rights would be absorbed under the name Classic Media.

In 2012, it was announced that Classic Media, owner of the Filmation library, would be acquired by DreamWorks Animation. DreamWorks Animation and its programming library, including those of Filmation (not including shows whose rights are owned by other companies, such as &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;), would later be acquired on August 22, 2016, by Universal Studios for $3.8 billion.

== Filmography ==

=== Live-action shows ===
Filmation incorporated live-action into some of its animated series. Series like &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; and &quot;Archie&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; featured live-action footage of an audience watching the bands perform and &quot;Fat Albert&quot; had segments featuring series creator Bill Cosby. &quot;The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!&quot;, was more of a hybrid—a live-action variety show with animated segments. Actors appeared as characters from the &quot;Hero High&quot; portion of the series, singing songs and telling jokes.

Filmation made six fully live-action series, including &quot;Space Academy&quot;, its spin-off &quot;Jason of Star Command&quot;, &quot;Ark II&quot;, &quot;Shazam!&quot; (based on the DC Comics character Captain Marvel), &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot; and &quot;The Secrets of Isis&quot;.

==== &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot; ====
Filmation produced a live-action series called &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot; (1975), starring former &quot;F Troop&quot; stars Larry Storch and Forrest Tucker, with noted science-fiction fan and collector Bob Burns as &quot;Tracy the Gorilla&quot;. The characters worked as paranormal investigators, working for an unseen &quot;Chief&quot; named &quot;Zero&quot; who delivered their &quot;Ghost Busting Assignments&quot; in whimsical disguised recording devices as in &quot;&quot;.

Nine years later, Columbia Pictures, who produced an unrelated 1984 movie of almost the same name, had to obtain the rights to the title from the company. Filmation capitalized on the popularity of the film by producing a new cartoon based on their earlier series. Like its other shows, it used stock footage heavily; in one episode, character designs and animation sequences were recycled from the &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot; series of nearly 15 years earlier.

To avoid confusion, the animated series based on the film was called &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;. As a dig on the Filmation series, an episode was written about a group of fraudulent ghost fighters, trying to steal the &quot;Real&quot; Ghostbusters&#x27; business and thunder.

==== Looney Tunes/Groovie Goolies crossover ====
Also of note is &quot;Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies&quot;, a special featuring several of Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; stars (except Bugs Bunny) paired with Filmation&#x27;s own &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot;, a group of classic monsters. Directed by Sutherland and written by Len Janson and Chuck Menville, it aired on ABC as part of &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot; on December 16, 1972. While most of the Warner Bros. characters were drawn well (veteran Warners animator Virgil Ross was working there at the time, along with other animators that had worked for Warner Bros. Animation in the late 1960s, such as Laverne Harding and Ed Solomon), and were voiced by veteran voice actor Mel Blanc, the special is not liked by many fans of classic Warner Bros. animation because of its limited animation, as well as a weak storyline.

This was not Filmation&#x27;s last dalliance with classic cartoon characters; in the late 1970s the company produced new series based on the characters from the Terrytoons archive (Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle, titled &quot;The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot;) and a new &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; series as well.

=== Feature films ===
Filmation also ventured into the feature film business. With their success in television firmly established by 1970, the company became profitable enough to return to the shelved &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; project, completing the animation and some minor voiceover work begun in 1962, and finished the film in 1971. It would take another year for &quot;Journey&quot; to be released theatrically in the United Kingdom, two more years before its 1974 U.S. release, and yet another two (1976) before it finally found its audience in network television, the very medium in which Filmation became successful. There, the film was expanded with live-action segments featuring Bill Cosby, who was in the midst of his success with the studio&#x27;s &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;.

A deal with Warner Bros. yielded &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, but left several others unproduced.

In its final years, Filmation produced feature films of its &quot;He-Man&quot; and &quot;She-Ra&quot; franchises (&quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot;), as well as continuations to established stories, such as &quot;Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night&quot; (1987) and &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; (1989; unreleased until 1993). In 1986, Omega Entertainment inked a worldwide television pact with Filmation in order to distribute the company&#x27;s non-animated products, such as theatrical feature films, for worldwide TV distribution. Also that year, on October 22, Filmation is beginning to serve as representative for three animated films at the MIFED, in order to cleaning up unsold territories on various Filmation productions, which accordingly hit by a lawsuit from The Walt Disney Company back in 1985 in order to prevent making films that the company claims to be based on Disney classics.

== Voice talent ==
Like other animation studios, Filmation had its stock company of voiceover actors. Some of the most famous included Larry Storch, Dallas McKennon (best known as the voice of Archie in the Archie cartoon and as Cincinnatus, in the Daniel Boone TV series), Bud Collyer, the original radio voice of Superman, reprised the role for Filmation for their late 1960s version of the Man of Steel; Adam West and Burt Ward (who recreated their roles as &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; from their 1960s live-action series for Filmation&#x27;s 1977 animated incarnation), Jane Webb, and good friends and colleagues Edward Asner and Linda Gary (Gary voiced a majority of Filmation&#x27;s work in the 1980s), along with John Erwin (voice of Reggie Mantle, and later the voice of He-Man), Alan Oppenheimer (character actor in TV and film), Ted Knight, George DiCenzo (John Blackstar, Hordak, Bow on &quot;She-Ra&quot;), Bill Cosby (voice of Fat Albert and himself), Melendy Britt, Howard Morris, Pat Fraley, Charlie Adler, Ed Gilbert, Susan Blu, Peter Cullen, Frank Welker, and Lou Scheimer (either uncredited, or under the pseudonym of &quot;Erik (sometimes &quot;Eric&quot;) Gunden&quot;).

=== Background musical talent ===
For the company&#x27;s 1960s superhero efforts, composer John Gart (under the stage name John Marion) and music supervisor Gordon Zahler created strong themes and backing cues using a large orchestra, until the &quot;Batman&quot; entry in 1968, which used sparser production and jazzier themes.

The company&#x27;s 1960s adventure series &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1967) and &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1968) likewise used sparser music production. &quot;Journey&quot; made heavier emphasis on guitar than the company&#x27;s previous series, while &quot;Voyage&quot; made use of deliberately haunting woodwinds to create a science fiction flavor.

According to the booklets accompanying some of the DVDs of Filmation&#x27;s shows, composer Ray Ellis (who was assisted by his son Marc Ellis) had produced the background music for most Filmation series under the pseudonyms &quot;Yvette Blais and Jeff Michael&quot;. Yvette Blais was Ellis&#x27;s wife, while &quot;Jeff&quot; and &quot;Michael&quot; were the names of producer Norm Prescott&#x27;s two sons (exactly what role Prescott played in the music, other than hiring the composers and musicians, is unclear). The full-length features &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; credit &quot;George Blais&quot;. Ellis&#x27;s name does appear in &quot;Archie&quot; and &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; credits and both &quot;Ray Ellis&quot;, and &quot;Jeff Michaels&quot; appear side by side on &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot; credits, where &quot;Ellis&quot; is credited for &quot;Sabrina background music&quot;, and &quot;Michaels&quot; is credited for &quot;Groovie Goolies background music&quot;.

Much of Ellis&#x27;s background music in the late 1960s had a distinct, richly orchestrated sound not found on many other made-for-TV cartoon series of that period; though as time went on, it became more contemporary and often synthesized. Ellis&#x27;s work at the studio lasted from 1968 to 1982. Haim Saban and Shuki Levy composed and produced the studio&#x27;s music for &quot;He-Man&quot; and &quot;She-Ra&quot; (during 1983–1986), along with the other studios for which they produced music scores. Frank W. Becker provided the music for Filmation&#x27;s final animated series &quot;BraveStarr&quot;.

In 1977, Dean Andre (Wallschlaeger), a 24-year-old composer/recording artist/producer, began writing theme and featured music for Filmation. His first series &quot;Archie&#x27;s Bang-Shang Lalapalooza Show&quot; featured the voice of Daws Butler. He went on to compose themes for &quot;The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot; and &quot;Fabulous Funnies&quot; (featuring the voices of June Foray and Alan Oppenheimer). Dean also lent his vocal talents to Filmation for thematic and featured music that he composed and produced for &quot;A Snow White Christmas&quot;, &quot;Sport Billy&quot; and &quot;The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!&quot; In 1981, Dean also took on the position of musical director for &quot;The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!&quot;.

Filmation routinely included a plug for its music publisher, Shermley Music (ASCAP), in the closing credits of most of its series. This has never been common practice on American television.

<text>The Bure Valley Railway is a minimum gauge visitors&#x27; attraction in Norfolk, England. It was created on the original disused full-gauge bed of a defunct passenger service to incorporate a new, adjacent pedestrian footpath.

The railway runs from Wroxham to Aylsham () and is Norfolk&#x27;s second longest heritage railway. It uses both steam and diesel locomotives. There are intermediate halts at Brampton, Buxton and Coltishall. There are 17 bridges, including a -long girder bridge over the River Bure in Buxton with Lammas, and the Aylsham Bypass Tunnel under the A140 at Aylsham.

The railway is listed as exempt from the UK Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2000.

== History ==


The railway is built on part of the trackbed of the East Norfolk Railway (ENR). The ENR started in 1877 when the East Norfolk Railway opened from Norwich to Cromer, with an extension from Wroxham to Aylsham in 1880. The western extension was planned by Edward Wilson &amp; Co. in 1876, with the line being constructed by William Waddell at a cost of £44,000, initially employing 100 men, 10 horses and 43 waggons.

The ENR was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway in 1882, although they had always held a controlling interest in the company, with the GER completing the line&#x27;s extension to County School on the Norfolk Railway&#x27;s line. The GER was amalgamated into the London &amp; North Eastern Railway in 1923, and the railway was nationalised in 1948.

On 15 September 1952 the passenger service stopped, and the line between Foulsham and Reepham was closed to all traffic, but the freight service continued on the remainder of the line. , as it was then known, closed for goods in 1964, and Aylsham and Coltishall in 1974.

Freight trains continued to run over the line after this for two principal sources of traffic. From September 1960, the line west of Aylsham via Cawston and Reepham, which originally went to the junction at County School Station, instead turned south via a new curve at Themelthorpe to join a fragment of the old Midland and Great Northern system to reach and .

Coal traffic continued to be carried from via Aylsham to Norwich City There was also regular traffic from Lenwade in the form of concrete building components.

This traffic ended in 1981 and the line through Aylsham formally closed on 6 January 1982. A weed-killing train ran in 1983 and track-lifting trains ran the following year.

== Re-opening ==

The trackbed was purchased by Broadland District Council, initially with plans to develop it as a long-distance footpath. In 1986, however, the idea of using part of the closed line as an operational railway was considered. Equipment and experience of railway operation came from Robert Hudson and John Edwards, who supplied railway equipment to Pleasurewood Hills, with &quot;Pleasureworld&quot;, under Chairman Joe Larter, providing tourism experience. Graham Fowler, of Broadland District Council, was later appointed the first General Manager. Grants from the English Tourist Board and Department of the Environment helped launch the £2.5 million scheme.

Forty three objections to the restoration of the line were made to the Light Railway Order, for the following reasons:
* the appearance of the railway in the landscape;
* the possible effect on property values;
* possible congestion in Aylsham, including access to/from the station;
* the width of the footpath adjacent to the railway,
* the security of the fence separating it from the railway;
* possible noise from premises at Aylsham Station associated with sheet metal working. 

Many of these issues were resolved by conducting a comparative study between the proposed Bure Valley Railway and the established Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway, with various mitigations required of the new company. Consent was given for the rebuilding of the line in 1987, despite local objections and with complaints from residents of Buxton with Lamas initially seeing plans for a restored station in the village dropped.

Track relaying, using 30-foot section flat-bottom steel rail (BS 30 m) secured by Pandrol clips, was well-underway in September 1989, with one-and-a-half miles of the track relaid and claims that the new railway would create about 60 jobs. In 1990, the station buildings at Aylsham, one of the most complete remaining Great Eastern station complexes in Norfolk, were demolished to make way for the new Bure Valley Railway headquarters. Construction of the line created the Aylsham Bypass Tunnel, Norfolk&#x27;s only operational railway tunnel, which carries the railway under the Aylsham Bypass replacing the original standard gauge level crossing. Cromer Tunnel in Cromer, the only other surviving railway tunnel in the county, is disused.

The Bure Valley Railway opened on 10 July 1990 under the management of RKF Leisure which had purchased the trackbed. The opening ceremony saw a series of issues, including overloading of the first train, causing it to stall at Coltishall for 30 minutes with defective brakes. 

===Receivership and rescue by Broadland District Council===
When the RKF&#x27;s parent company, RKF Group Plc, went into receivership in January 1991, Broadland District Council moved quickly to acquire the line from the receivers as it feared that property developers might seize the opportunity to take control of the land. Agreement was reached with Ffestiniog Railway director Mike Hart to set up a new company, Bure Valley Railway (1991) Ltd, to lease and operate the line. A long distance footpath (rail trail) opened alongside it in 1991.

In 1993 Mike Hart sold his interest in Bure Valley Railway (1991) Limited to Robert Baker of Sudbury, Suffolk. In 1995 control passed to Westernasset Limited. In 2001 control of Westernasset was acquired by Andrew Barnes. Westernasset was subsequently wound up and shares in Bure Valley Railway (1991) Limited were held directly by Andrew Barnes, who operates the railway on a not for profit basis with the support of many volunteers.

Broadland District Council considered selling the line to the Bure Valley Railway in June 2017, but this was delayed by Brexit, resulting in a partnership approach being made by Norfolk County Council, which it was felt would improve the opportunities for funding and ensure the retention of the permissive footpath alongside the line. The council&#x27;s managing director stated that it was important that &quot;members should be sure about what they were seeking to achieve by the disposal of the railway&quot;. The Council changed its mind before the transaction was completed and the route continues to be owned by Broadland District Council. In 2019 Norfolk County Council received £1.2 million Interreg funding to invest in refurbishments along the Bure Valley route. This was additional to the £10,000 annual maintenance budget the council employs on the line.

In March 2020 the Bure Valley Railway threatened to take the council to the Office of Rail and Road over a claimed contractual failure to adequately maintain fences and structures along the line for which the council has responsibility.

===COVID-19 and financial troubles===

In April 2020 the railway stated that they were in difficulties due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations.

In June 2020 the local media reported, that the BVR were in &quot;dire straits&quot; and at risk of closure due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the refusal of an insurance claim relating to loss of income, despite Broadland DC deferring their annual £30,000 rent payments until September 2020 and receiving a £25,000 Covid-19 support grant. Full relief from business rates was granted by national government for 2020/21 fiscal year. The BVR furloughed some of its staff.

The railway&#x27;s case against insurer MS Amlin, who the railway claimed had refused to pay out cover for loss of income due to “any notifiable disease within a radius of 25 miles of the premises” drew national attention. The railway was able to re-open with volunteers on at weekends from 11 July and 5 days per week from 1 August were all staff came off the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. As of January 2021, the insurance claim remained unpaid despite a High Court ruling that insurers had to make payments owed under business interruption policies.

In January 2021 the railway, once again, declared that they were in financial crisis, having lost £765,000 in a year despite having been able to operate for much of their main season. The issues were compounded by the discovery of major faults on two of the railway&#x27;s steam locomotive boilers, the failures of which might mean that the railway would not have the required locomotives to be able to reopen if said boilers were not repaired/replaced.

The railway opened again in Summer 2021, after the boilers of two locomotives were replaced.

=== Alternative Fuel ===
In June and December 2021, the railway performed trials contributing to the development of a sustainable coal replacement for steam locomotives on heritage railways, in collaboration with the Advanced Steam Traction Trust (ASTT), the Heritage Railway Association, and Coal Products Limited.

The first trial compared 3 bio-coals to traditional welsh coal, and the second pitted the best performing of these bio-coals against the welsh coal again, but under harsher conditions. The first trial found that a variant of Ecoal50 could deliver equal engine performance with a 28% increase in coal consumption, and this coal was chosen for use in the second trial.

In May 2022, the railway won the Heritage Railway Association&#x27;s &quot;Award for Environmental Innovation&quot; for their work.

== Locomotives ==
A list of the railway&#x27;s operational locomotives is below:
== Passenger coaches ==

Passenger rolling stock consists of 29 vehicles, which are usually marshalled so as to form three complete carriage sets, thus allowing for the operation of up to three distinct passenger trains. The 29 vehicles may be further subdivided as below:
* 19 standard passenger saloon bogie coaches
* 6 standard passenger saloon bogie coaches with wheelchair-accessible compartments
* 1 brake composite bogie coach with guard&#x27;s compartment, baggage compartment, and passenger compartments
* 1 brake composite bogie coach with guard&#x27;s compartment, baggage compartment, and diesel generator for winter train heating
* 2 brake short-wheelbase coaches (4-wheel) with guard&#x27;s compartment and baggage compartment

All except one of the carriages are equipped with electric heating, for winter services. All carriages are equipped with internal lighting. All carriages are connected to a passenger communication system, allowing passengers to stop the train in an emergency.

In addition to the standard coaching stock, two non-standard passenger saloon bogie coaches, formerly used on the Fairbourne Railway, were acquired for use on special event days, purporting to be Thomas the Tank Engine&#x27;s coaches, Annie and Clarabel. These vehicles were subsequently sold to the Evesham Vale Light Railway and left Aylsham in Spring 2016. They are now painted in standard EVLR colours.

== Accidents ==
On Monday 30 May 2011, a train on the line suffered a derailment at Brampton, during which wheels from one of the coaches were reported to have come up through the floor of the vehicle. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch were called in to conduct a preliminary examination into the incident, and found it to have been caused by the failure due to metal fatigue of an axle journal that had been welded several years previously (when the railway was under different management). It found that the BVR did not have an adequate safety management system. Following this accident all wheels of this design were identified by the railway and scrapped, being replaced by new wheelsets, and a new computerised passenger carriage maintenance database was introduced, providing detailed tracking of the service regime of whole carriages, and of individual bogies and axles.

== The Friends of the Bure Valley Railway ==
The Friends of the Bure Valley Railway (FoBVR) is the volunteer supporting group for the Bure Valley Railway. It owns locomotive number 4 and supports the railway financially and with regular working parties of volunteers. There is a hut at Aylsham which sells donated bric-a-brac, second hand books and magazines during the season to raise money to support the railway. A secondhand book, record and DVD shop is open at Wroxham station.

<text>Euphemia Chalmers Millais, Lady Millais (&quot;née&quot; Gray; 7 May 1828 – 23 December 1897) was a Scottish artists&#x27; model and writer who was married to Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais. She had previously married the art critic John Ruskin, but she left him with the marriage never having been consummated; it was subsequently annulled. This famous Victorian &quot;love triangle&quot; has been dramatised in plays, films, and an opera.

== Early life ==
Euphemia Chalmers Gray was born on 7 May 1828 in Perth, Perthshire, Scotland to lawyer and businessman George Gray (1798–1877) and Sophia Margaret (1808–1894), daughter of Andrew Jameson, Sheriff-substitute of Fife. She grew up at Bowerswell, an Italianate-style house near the foot of Kinnoull Hill. Though she was given the pet-name &quot;Phemy&quot; by her parents as a child, she started to be known as &quot;Effie&quot; by the time she was a teenager. Her sisters Sophie and Alice often modelled for John Everett Millais.

Between 1842 and 1844 she attended Avonbank school run by the Misses Byerley near Stratford on Avon, Warwickshire, England, partly as her parents wanted her to lose her Scottish accent. She was an assiduous student at Avonbank winning prizes in every year but was taken out of school to be a support to her mother when her siblings died of scarlet fever.

== Relationship with John Ruskin ==
John Ruskin wrote the fantasy story &quot;The King of the Golden River&quot; for Gray in 1841, when she was 12 and he was 21. Gray&#x27;s family knew Ruskin&#x27;s father and encouraged a match between the two when she had matured. After an initially unsteady courtship, she married Ruskin on 10 April 1848; she was 19 years old. During their honeymoon, they travelled to Venice, where Ruskin was doing research for his book &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;. While in Perth, Scotland, they lived at Bowerswell, the Gray family home, and site of their wedding. It had, coincidentally, previously been the home of Ruskin&#x27;s paternal grandparents. In 1817, Ruskin&#x27;s mother, Margaret, during her engagement to Ruskin&#x27;s father, had stayed at Bowerswell and was witness to three tragic deaths within its walls in quick succession (Ruskin&#x27;s grandmother, grandfather, and newborn cousin). This caused her to develop a severe phobia concerning Bowerswell, keeping her from attending her son&#x27;s wedding to Gray.

Gray and Ruskin&#x27;s different personalities were thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Gray, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro and the Palazzo Ducale (Doge&#x27;s Palace), because he feared they would soon be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of the troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Gray, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later said that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship in order to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

When she met John Everett Millais five years later, Gray was still a virgin. Ruskin had persistently put off consummating the marriage. Gray and Ruskin had agreed upon abstaining from sex for five years to allow Ruskin to focus on his studies. Another reason involved his apparent disgust with some aspect of her body. As she later wrote to her father:

He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening.

Ruskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings: &quot;It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.&quot; The reason for Ruskin&#x27;s disgust with &quot;circumstances in her person&quot; is unknown. Various suggestions have been made, including revulsion at either her pubic hair or menstrual blood. Robert Brownell, on the contrary, in his analysis &quot;Marriage of Inconvenience&quot;, argues that Ruskin&#x27;s difficulty with the marriage was financial and related to concerns that Gray and her less affluent family were trying to tap into Ruskin&#x27;s considerable wealth.

== Relationship with John Everett Millais ==
While married to Ruskin, Gray modelled for Millais&#x27; painting &quot;The Order of Release&quot;, in which she was depicted as the loyal wife of a Scottish rebel who has secured his release from prison. She then became close to Millais when he accompanied the couple on a trip to Scotland in order to paint Ruskin&#x27;s portrait according to the critic&#x27;s artistic principles. During this time, spent in Brig o&#x27; Turk in the Trossachs, they fell in love. While working on the portrait of her husband, Millais made many drawings and sketches of Gray. He also sent humorous cartoons of himself, Gray and Ruskin to friends. She copied some of his works.

After their return to London, Gray left Ruskin, ostensibly to visit her family. She sent back her wedding ring with a note announcing her intention to file for an annulment. With the support of her family and influential friends, she pursued the case, causing a public scandal. Their marriage was annulled on the grounds of &quot;incurable impotency&quot; in 1854.

== Marriage to John Everett Millais ==

In 1855, she married John Millais and they had eight children together: Everett, born in 1856; George, born in 1857; Effie, born in 1858; Mary, born in 1860; Alice, born in 1862; Geoffrey, born in 1863; John in 1865; and Sophie in 1868. Their youngest son, John Guille Millais, became a notable bird artist and gardener. Gray also modelled for a number of her husband&#x27;s works, notably &quot;Peace Concluded&quot; (1856), which idealises her as an icon of beauty and fertility. In 1885, her husband was elevated to the baronetage by Queen Victoria, having been created Baronet Millais of Palace Gate, in the parish of St Mary Abbot, Kensington, in the county of Middlesex, and of Saint Ouen, in the Island of Jersey. Upon her husband&#x27;s elevation, Effie became entitled to use the style Lady Millais.

=== Ruskin&#x27;s rapport with Rose La Touche ===

In 1858, Ruskin met Rose La Touche; at the time she was 10 years old, and he became her teacher in drawing as well as other subjects. Ruskin became attracted to La Touche and when she turned 18 sought to become engaged. Rose&#x27;s parents were concerned and wrote to Gray, asking for her opinion of Ruskin as a husband. Her reply described him as &quot;oppressive&quot;. The engagement was broken off.

=== Influence on Millais ===

Gray was an effective manager of Millais&#x27; career and often collaborated with him in choosing his subjects. Her journal indicates her high regard for her husband&#x27;s art, and his works are still recognisably Pre-Raphaelite in style several years after his marriage.

However, Millais eventually abandoned the Pre-Raphaelite obsession with detail and began to paint in a looser style which produced more paintings for the time and effort. Many paintings were inspired by his family life with his wife, often using his children and grandchildren as models. Millais also used his sister-in-law, Sophie Gray, then in her early teens, as the basis of some striking images in the mid to late 1850s, provoking suggestions of a mutual infatuation.

== Later life and death ==

Gray had been officially presented to Queen Victoria on 20 June 1850. This was arranged by Lady Davy, a friend and neighbour of hers from London who was also friends with one of the Queen&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting. However, the annulment from Ruskin barred her from events at which the Queen was present. Her social status was affected negatively, although many in society were still prepared to receive her and to press her case sympathetically. Eventually, when Millais was dying, the Queen relented through the intervention of her daughter Princess Louise, allowing Gray to attend an official function. 

Gray had an interest in local and family history, and corresponded with Perthshire historian Robert Scott Fittis, author of Sketches of the Olden Times in Perthshire (1878), about the Gray family history. 

Sixteen months after Millais&#x27; death in August 1896, Gray died at Bowerswell on 23 December 1897. She was buried beside her son George, who died aged 21, in Kinnoull Parish churchyard, Perth, which is depicted in Millais&#x27;s painting &quot;The Vale of Rest&quot;. Gray&#x27;s father had donated the Millais window, the West window, to Kinnoull Church in 1870. It is based on designs drawn by Millais.

Her letters have been published posthumously in &quot;Effie in Venice: Her Picture of Society Life with John Ruskin, 1849-52&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Order of Release: The Story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais Told for the First Time in their Unpublished Letters&quot; (1948).

<doc id="102810" wikidata="Q313976" url="?curid=102810" title="P. G. T. Beauregard">
<text>Pierre Gustave Toutant-Beauregard (May 28, 1818 – February 20, 1893) was an American military officer known as being the Confederate general who started the American Civil War at the battle of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Today, he is commonly referred to as P. G. T. Beauregard, but he rarely used his first name as an adult. He signed correspondence as G. T. Beauregard.

Trained in military and civil engineering at the United States Military Academy, West Point, Beauregard served with distinction as an engineer officer in the Mexican–American War. Following a brief appointment as superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy in 1861, and after Louisiana seceded, he resigned from the United States Army and became the first brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. He commanded the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina, at the start of the Civil War at Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Three months later he helped win the First Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia.

Beauregard held several key commands in the Western Theater, including control of armies at the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, and the Siege of Corinth in northern Mississippi, both in 1862. He returned to Charleston and defended it in 1863 from repeated naval and land attacks by Union forces. He is most known for his defense of the industrial city of Petersburg, Virginia, from Union troops in June 1864, which delayed the eventual fall of the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia in April 1865.

His influence over Confederate strategy was lessened by his poor professional relationships with President Jefferson Davis and other senior generals and officials. In April 1865, Beauregard and his commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, convinced Davis and the remaining cabinet members that the war needed to end. Johnston surrendered most of the remaining armies of the Confederacy, including Beauregard and his men, to Major General William Tecumseh Sherman.

After his military career, Beauregard returned to Louisiana, where he advocated black civil rights including suffrage as a means of voting out Radical Republicans, served as a railroad executive, and became wealthy as a promoter of the Louisiana Lottery.

==Early life and education==

Beauregard was born at the &quot;Contreras&quot; sugar-cane plantation in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, about outside New Orleans, to a Louisiana Creole family. Beauregard was the third child of Hélène Judith de Reggio, of mixed French and Italian ancestry and descendant of Francesco Maria de Reggio, member of an Italian noble family whose family had migrated first to France and then to Louisiana, and her husband, Jacques Toutant-Beauregard, of French and German ancestry. He had three brothers and three sisters. As was typical for Louisiana Creoles, his family spoke French and practiced Catholicism.

Beauregard had several Creole of color cousins and uncles; the Creole of color side of Beauregard&#x27;s family came from a marriage between Marguerite Pantalon (daughter of a prominent New Orleans Creole of color family) and one of Beauregard&#x27;s uncles, Martin Barthelemy Toutant Beauregard.

As a child, he befriended and played with slave boys his own age, including his favorite friend, the tall and strong storyteller Baptiste; Beauregard was often seen following and frolicking by Baptiste&#x27;s side. Beauregard was nursed by a slave woman from Saint-Domingue (later Haiti) named Mamie Françoise Similien. 

Similien and Beauregard had a very close relationship, often seen giving each other hugs and kisses. Similien was held in the Beauregards&#x27; highest esteem, and after Pierre&#x27;s grandfather died, the Beauregard family gave Similien a Creole Cottage in the Faubourg Treme of New Orleans. 

Pierre often visited with Mamie, and during an interview with a reporter of the New Orleans Times in 1882, while sharing stories of Pierre&#x27;s youth and growing up, Mamie pointed to a personal portrait that Pierre gave her during a visit in 1867, saying &quot;that&#x27;s my son&quot;. 

Beauregard grew up in a large one-story house, unlike the &quot;later plantation palaces, but a mansion of aristocracy by the standards of its time.&quot; He hunted and rode in the woods and fields around his family&#x27;s plantation and paddled his boat in its waterways. Beauregard attended New Orleans private schools and then went to a &quot;French school&quot; in New York City. During his four years in New York, beginning at age 12, he learned to speak English, as French had been his first and only language in Louisiana.

===West Point===
Beauregard attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. One of his instructors was Robert Anderson, the later commander of Fort Sumter; he surrendered to Beauregard at the start of the Civil War. Upon enrolling at West Point, Beauregard dropped the hyphen from his surname and treated Toutant as a middle name, to fit in with his classmates. From that point on, he rarely used his first name, preferring &quot;G. T. Beauregard.&quot; He graduated second in his class in 1838 and excelled both as an artilleryman and military engineer. His Army friends gave him many nicknames: &quot;Little Creole&quot;, &quot;Bory&quot;, &quot;Little Frenchman&quot;, &quot;Felix&quot;, and &quot;Little Napoleon&quot;.

In February 1845, Beauregard returned to Louisiana, where he moved into the French Quarter of New Orleans, living in a prominent Creole of color neighborhood on St.Louis Street. Beauregard maintained an office on Bourbon Street, where he continued his work for the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In the meantime, he worked on an improved furnace for boiling sugar.

==Early military career==
===Mexican-American War===

During the Mexican–American War, Beauregard served as an engineer under General Winfield Scott. He was appointed brevet captain for the battles of Contreras and Churubusco and major for Chapultepec, where he was wounded in the shoulder and thigh. He was noted for his eloquent performance in a meeting with Scott in which he convinced the assembled general officers to change their plan for attacking the fortress of Chapultepec. He was one of the first officers to enter Mexico City. Beauregard considered his contributions in dangerous reconnaissance missions and devising strategy for his superiors to be more significant than those of his engineer colleague, Captain Robert E. Lee, so he was disappointed when Lee and other officers received more brevets than he did.

===Return to New Orleans===
Beauregard returned from Mexico in 1848. For the next 12 years, he was in charge of what the Engineer Department called &quot;the Mississippi and Lake defenses in Louisiana.&quot; Much of his engineering work was done elsewhere, repairing old forts and building new ones on the Florida coast and in Mobile, Alabama. He also improved the defenses of Forts St. Philip and Jackson on the Mississippi River below New Orleans. He worked on a board of Army and Navy engineers to improve the navigation of the shipping channels at the mouth of the Mississippi. He created and patented an invention he called a &quot;self-acting bar excavator&quot; to be used by ships in crossing bars of sand and clay. While serving in the Army, he actively campaigned for the election of Franklin Pierce, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1852, and a former general in the Mexican War who had been impressed by Beauregard&#x27;s performance at Mexico City. Pierce appointed Beauregard as superintending engineer of the U.S. Custom House in New Orleans, a huge granite building that had been built in 1848. As it was sinking unevenly in the moist soil of Louisiana, Beauregard had to develop a renovation program. He served in this position from 1853 to 1860 and stabilized the structure successfully.

====Peacetime Officer, West Point Superintendent====
During his service in New Orleans, Beauregard became dissatisfied as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 that he was going to join the filibuster with William Walker, who had seized control of Nicaragua; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard to stay in the United States.

Beauregard briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.

Employing the political influence of his brother-in-law, John Slidell, Beauregard obtained an appointment as superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy on January 23, 1861. However, when Louisiana seceded from the Union, the Federal Government immediately revoked his orders and he subsequently relinquished his office after only five days. He protested to the U.S. War Department that they had cast &quot;improper reflection upon [his] reputation or position in the Corps of Engineers&quot; by forcing him out as a Southern officer before any hostilities began.

==American Civil War==
===Creole State, First CSA General===

Beauregard traveled by steamship from New York to New Orleans and immediately began giving military advice to the local authorities in his home state of Louisiana, which included further strengthening Forts St. Philip and Jackson, which guarded the Mississippi approaches to New Orleans. He hoped to be named commander of the Louisiana state army, but was disappointed that the state legislature appointed Braxton Bragg. Aware that Beauregard might resent him, Bragg offered him the rank of colonel. Instead Beauregard enrolled as a private in the &quot;Orleans Guards&quot;, a battalion of French Creole aristocrats. At the same time, he communicated with Slidell and the newly chosen President Davis, angling for a senior position in the new Confederate States Army. Rumors that Beauregard would be placed in charge of the entire Army infuriated Bragg. Concerned about the political situation regarding the Federal presence at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, Davis selected Beauregard to take command of Charleston&#x27;s defenses. Beauregard seemed the perfect combination of military engineer and charismatic Southern leader needed at that time and place.

Beauregard became one of the most frequently described generals in Confederate chronicles, and almost every observer noted his foreign French visage. His comportment was &quot;courteous, grave, sometimes reserved and severe, sometimes abrupt with people who displeased him.&quot; Associates saw him go months without smiling. &quot;Many who saw him thought he looked like a French marshal or like Napoleon in a gray uniform—which was what he wanted them to think.&quot;

&quot;Because he was French and seemed different, he was the victim of all kind of rumors, most of them baseless. The charge of immorality was, of course, inevitable. Some soldiers believed that he was accompanied by a train of concubines and wagons loaded with cases of champagne. Even in Louisiana it was said, by non-Creoles, that he was unfaithful to his wife, infidelity being allegedly a Creole characteristic.&quot;

&quot;[Beauregard&#x27;s] military retinue was a wonderful collection in itself to inspire rumor. His staff glittered with former governors and senators serving as voluntary aides.&quot; Beauregard also kept the company of Frederick Maginnis, a very important confidant; he rented him from a South Carolinian woman. &quot;Another eminent camp follower was a young Spaniard who served as Beauregard&#x27;s barber and valet.&quot;

Beauregard became the first Confederate general officer, appointed a brigadier general in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States on March 1, 1861. (On July 21, he was promoted to full general in the Confederate Army, one of only seven appointed to that rank; his date of rank made him the fifth most senior general, behind Samuel Cooper, Albert Sidney Johnston, Robert E. Lee, and Joseph E. Johnston.)

====Start of the Civil War, Fort Sumter====

Arriving in Charleston on March 3, 1861, Beauregard met with Governor Francis Wilkinson Pickens and inspected the defenses of the harbor, which he found to be in disarray. He was said to display &quot;a great deal in the way of zeal and energy ... but little professional knowledge and experience.&quot; Major Robert Anderson at Fort Sumter wrote to Washington, D.C., that Beauregard, who had been his student at West Point in 1837, would guarantee that South Carolina&#x27;s actions be exercised with &quot;skill and sound judgment.&quot; Beauregard wrote to the Confederate government that Anderson was a &quot;most gallant officer&quot;. He sent several cases of fine brandy and whiskey and boxes of cigars to Anderson and his officers at Sumter, but Anderson ordered that the gifts be returned.

By early April, political tensions were mounting and Beauregard demanded that Sumter surrender before a planned Union expedition to re-provision the fort could arrive. Early on the morning of April 12, negotiations with Anderson had failed. Beauregard ordered the first shots of the American Civil War to be fired from nearby Fort Johnson. The bombardment of Fort Sumter lasted for 34 hours. After a heavy bombardment from batteries ringing the harbor, Anderson surrendered Fort Sumter on April 14. Biographer T. Harry Williams described the extravagant praise from throughout the Confederacy that &quot;The Hero of Fort Sumter&quot; received for his victory: &quot;He was the South&#x27;s first paladin.&quot;

===First Bull Run (First Manassas)===
Summoned to the new Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, Beauregard received a hero&#x27;s welcome at the railroad stations along the route. He was given command of the &quot;Alexandria Line&quot; of defenses against an impending Federal offensive that was being organized by Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell (one of Beauregard&#x27;s West Point classmates) against the Confederate railroad junction at Manassas. Beauregard devised strategies to concentrate the forces of (full) General Joseph E. Johnston from the Shenandoah Valley with his own, aiming not only to defend his position, but to initiate an offensive against McDowell and Washington. Despite his seniority in rank, Johnston lacked familiarity with the terrain and ceded tactical planning of the impending battle to Beauregard as a professional courtesy. President Davis considered many of Beauregard&#x27;s plans to be impractical for an army as inexperienced as the Confederates could field in 1861; throughout the war, Davis and Beauregard would argue about Beauregard&#x27;s tendencies to devise grand strategies based on formal military principles. Davis believed he lacked a pragmatic grasp of logistics, intelligence, relative military strengths, and politics.

The First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) began early on July 21, 1861, with an element of surprise for both armies—both McDowell and Beauregard planned to envelop their opponent with an attack from their right flank. McDowell struck first, crossing Bull Run and threatening Beauregard&#x27;s left flank. For a while, Beauregard persisted in moving his troops for an attack on his right flank (McDowell&#x27;s left, toward Centreville), but Johnston urged him to travel with him to the threatened flank at Henry House Hill, which was weakly defended. Seeing the strength of the Union attack at that point, Beauregard insisted that Johnston leave the area of immediate action and coordinate the overall battle from a position to the rear. Beauregard rallied the troops, riding among the men, brandishing regimental colors, and giving inspirational speeches. The Confederate line held.

As Johnston&#x27;s final troops arrived from the Shenandoah Valley, the Confederates launched a counterattack that routed the Union Army, sending it streaming in disorder back toward Washington. William C. Davis credits Johnston with the majority of the tactical decisions that led to the victory, judging that &quot;Beauregard acted chiefly as a dime novel general, leading the charge of an individual regiment, riding along the line to cheer the troops, accepting the huzzas of the soldiers and complementing them in turn. The closest he came to a major tactical decision was his fleeting intention to withdraw from the Henry Hill line when he briefly mistook the advance of Johnston&#x27;s reinforcements for the arrival of fresh Union troops.&quot; Nonetheless, Beauregard received the bulk of the acclaim from the press and general public. On July 23, Johnston recommended to President Davis that Beauregard be promoted to full general. Davis approved, and Beauregard&#x27;s date of rank was established as the date of his victory, July 21.

====Confederate battle flag design====
After Bull Run, Beauregard advocated the use of a standardized battle flag other than the &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; Confederate national flag to avoid visual confusion with the U.S. flag. He worked with Johnston and William Porcher Miles to create the Confederate Battle Flag. Women visiting Beauregard&#x27;s army contributed silk material from their dresses to create the first three flags, for Beauregard, Johnston, and Earl Van Dorn; thus, the first flags contained more feminine pink than martial red. However, the official battle flag had a red background with white stars. Throughout his career, Beauregard worked to have the flag adopted, and he helped to make it the most popular symbol of the Confederacy.

As the Army went into winter quarters, Beauregard caused considerable friction with the Confederate high command. He strongly advocated an invasion of Maryland to threaten the flank and rear of Washington. With his plan rebuffed as impractical, he requested reassignment to New Orleans, which he assumed would be under Union attack in the near future, but his request was denied. He quarreled with Commissary General Lucius B. Northrop (a personal friend of Davis) about the inadequate supplies available to his army. He issued public statements challenging the ability of the Confederate Secretary of War to give commands to a full general. And he enraged President Davis when his report about Bull Run was printed in the newspaper, which suggested that Davis&#x27;s interference with Beauregard&#x27;s plans prevented the pursuit and full destruction of McDowell&#x27;s army and the capture of Washington.

===Shiloh and Corinth===

Having become a political liability in Virginia, Beauregard was transferred to Tennessee to become second-in-command to General Albert Sidney Johnston (no relation to Joseph E. Johnston) in his Army of Mississippi, effective March 14, 1862. The two generals planned the concentration of Confederate forces to oppose the advance of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant before he could combine his army with that of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell in a thrust up the Tennessee River toward Corinth, Mississippi. The march from Corinth was plagued by bad weather, which delayed the army&#x27;s arrival by several days, and during that time, several contacts were made with Union scouts. Because of this, Beauregard felt the element of surprise had been lost and recommended calling off the attack, but Johnston decided to proceed with the plan. In the Battle of Shiloh, which began April 6, 1862, the Confederates launched a surprise attack against Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee, which despite days of prior reports of Confederate troop movements, were completely unaware that the entire Army of Mississippi was coming directly at them. Once again a more senior general named Johnston deferred to the junior Beauregard in planning the attack. The massive frontal assault was marred by Beauregard&#x27;s improper organization of forces—successive attacks by corps in lines long, rather than assigning each corps a discrete portion of the line for a side-by-side assault. This arrangement caused intermingling of units and confusion of command; it failed to concentrate mass at the appropriate place on the line to affect the overall objectives of the attack. In midafternoon, Johnston, who was near the front of the battle action, was mortally wounded. Beauregard, positioned in the rear of the army to send reinforcements forward, assumed command of the army and Johnston&#x27;s overall Western department (officially designated &quot;Department Number Two&quot;). As darkness fell, he chose to call off the attack against Grant&#x27;s final defensive line, which had contracted into a tight semicircle backed up to the Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing.

Beauregard&#x27;s decision was one of the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered about the aftermath if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant&#x27;s defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.

Grant was temporarily disgraced by the surprise attack and near defeat, causing his superior, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, to assume field command of the combined armies. Halleck cautiously and slowly approached Beauregard&#x27;s fortifications at Corinth; his action became derisively called the Siege of Corinth. Beauregard withdrew from Corinth on May 29 to Tupelo, Mississippi. He was able to deceive Halleck into thinking the Confederates were about to attack; he ran empty trains back and forth through the town while whistles blew and troops cheered as if massive reinforcements were arriving. Beauregard retreated because of the overwhelming Union force and because of contaminated water supplies in Corinth. In April and May, the Confederates lost almost as many men to death by disease in Corinth as had been killed in battle at Shiloh. Nevertheless, his leaving the critical rail junction at Corinth without a fight was another controversial decision. When Beauregard went on medical leave without requesting permission in advance, President Davis relieved him of command and replaced him with Gen. Braxton Bragg.

===Return to Charleston===

At Beauregard&#x27;s request, his allies in the Confederate Congress petitioned Davis to restore his command in the West. Davis remained angry at Beauregard&#x27;s absence and told him he should have stayed at his post even if he had to be carried around in a litter. He wrote, &quot;If the whole world were to ask me to restore General Beauregard to the command which I have already given to General Bragg, I would refuse it.&quot; Beauregard was ordered to Charleston and took command of coastal defenses in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, replacing Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton. The latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi.

Beauregard was unhappy with his new assignment, believing that he deserved command of one of the great Confederate field armies. He performed successfully, however, preventing the capture of Charleston by Union naval and land attacks in 1863. On April 7, 1863, Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, led a union ironclad attack against Fort Sumter that was repulsed by highly accurate artillery fire from Beauregard&#x27;s forces. In July through September 1863, union land forces under Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore launched a series of attacks on Fort Wagner on Morris Island and other fortifications at the mouth of the harbor, while Rear Adm. John A. Dahlgren attempted to destroy Fort Sumter. Because the latter operation failed, the successful seizure of Morris Island was not effective in threatening Charleston.

During this period, Beauregard promoted innovative naval defense strategies, such as early experimentation with submarines, naval mines (called &quot;torpedoes&quot; in the Civil War), and with a small vessel called a torpedo-ram. A swift boat fitted with a torpedo on a pole projecting from its bow under water, it could be used to surprise an enemy vessel and impale it underneath the water line. He was also busy devising strategies for other generals in the Confederacy. He proposed that some of the state governors meet with Union governors of the Western states (what are called the Midwest states today) for a peace conference. The Davis administration rejected the idea, but it caused considerable political maneuvering by Davis&#x27;s enemies in the Congress. Beauregard also proposed a grand strategy—submitted anonymously through his political allies so that it was not tainted by his reputation—to reinforce the Western armies at the expense of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army in Virginia, destroy the Federal army in Tennessee, which would induce Ulysses S. Grant to relieve pressure on Vicksburg and maneuver his army into a place where it could be destroyed. The Confederate Army would continue to Ohio, and induce the Western states to ally with the Confederacy. Meanwhile, a fleet of torpedo-rams built in England could be used to recapture New Orleans, ending the war. There is no record that his plan was ever officially presented to the government.

While visiting his forces in Florida, which had just repelled a Union advance at Jacksonville, Beauregard received a telegram that his wife had died on March 2, 1864. Living in Union-occupied New Orleans, she had been seriously ill for two years. A Northern-leaning local newspaper printed an opinion that her husband&#x27;s actions had exacerbated her condition. This so fanned negative popular opinion that 6,000 people attended her funeral. Union Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks provided a steamer to carry her body upriver for burial in her native parish. Beauregard wrote that he would like to rescue &quot;her hallowed grave&quot; at the head of an army.

===Richmond===
In April 1864, Beauregard saw little opportunity for military glory because he foresaw that there would be no more significant assaults against Charleston, and prospects for a major field command were unlikely. He requested a leave to recover from fatigue and a chronic throat ailment, but he instead received an order to report to Weldon, North Carolina, near the Virginia border, to play a key role in the defense of Virginia. His new assignment, the Department of North Carolina and Cape Fear, also included Virginia south of the James River. When he took command on April 18, he renamed it, on his own initiative, the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. The Confederates were preparing for the spring offensive of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and were concerned that attacks south of Richmond could interrupt the critical supply lines to Richmond and the army of Robert E. Lee.

As Grant moved south against Lee in the Overland campaign, Union Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler launched the surprise Bermuda Hundred Campaign with landings up the James River. Beauregard successfully lobbied with Jefferson Davis&#x27;s military adviser, Braxton Bragg, to prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred north of Richmond to the aid of Lee. His timely action, coupled with the military incompetence of Butler, bottled up the Union army, nullifying its threat to Petersburg and Lee&#x27;s supply line. Now that this sector was stable, pressure began to rise to transfer troops from Beauregard&#x27;s front to Lee&#x27;s. Beauregard did send a division (Maj. Gen. Robert Hoke&#x27;s) to Lee for the Battle of Cold Harbor, but Lee urgently wanted more and took the step of offering Beauregard command of the right wing of the Army of Northern Virginia for his cooperation. Beauregard replied in a passive–aggressive manner, &quot;I am willing to do anything for our success, but cannot leave my Department without orders of War Department.&quot;

After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate high command were unable to anticipate Grant&#x27;s next move, but Beauregard&#x27;s strategic sense allowed him to make a prophetic prediction: Grant crossed the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee&#x27;s army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.

Beauregard continued commanding the defenses of Petersburg in the early days of the siege, but with the loss of the Weldon Railroad in the Battle of Globe Tavern (August 18–21), he was criticized for not attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with the command arrangements under Lee. He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to lead an expedition north through the Shenandoah Valley and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood to replace the faltering Joseph E. Johnston in the Atlanta campaign.

===Return to the West===
After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis considered replacing John Bell Hood in command of the Army of Tennessee and he asked Robert E. Lee to find out if Beauregard would be interested. Beauregard was indeed interested, but it is unclear whether Davis seriously considered the appointment, and in the end decided to retain Hood. Davis met with Beauregard in Augusta, Georgia, on October 2 and offered him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River, with the armies of Hood and Richard Taylor under his ostensible command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of the armies unless he should join them in person during an emergency. Nevertheless, anxious to return to the field, he accepted the assignment.

The major field operation of the fall was Hood&#x27;s Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an invasion of Tennessee, which he undertook under Beauregard and Davis&#x27; orders. Beauregard always kept in touch with Hood, despite all the obstacles facing the latter general&#x27;s way. The two later developed a friendship that lasted until Hood&#x27;s death in 1879, after which Beauregard became chairman of the Hood Relief Committee; he arranged for the publication of Hood&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Advance and Retreat&quot;, in order to care for the orphaned Hood children.

While Hood traveled through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, which focused Beauregard&#x27;s attention back to Georgia. He was ineffective in stopping, or even delaying, Sherman&#x27;s advance. He had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against Sherman. Furthermore, Sherman did an excellent job of deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of his march. Savannah fell on December 21, and Sherman&#x27;s army began to march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December, Beauregard found out that Hood&#x27;s army had been severely weakened in its defeat at the Battle of Nashville; there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose Sherman&#x27;s advance.

Beauregard attempted to concentrate his small forces before Sherman could reach Columbia, South Carolina, the state capital. His urgent dispatches to Richmond were treated with disbelief—Davis and Robert E. Lee (now the general in chief of all the Confederate armies) could not believe that Sherman was advancing without a supply line as quickly as Beauregard was observing him do. Also concerned about what he considered Beauregard&#x27;s &quot;feeble health,&quot; Lee recommended to Davis that he be replaced by Joseph E. Johnston. The change of command came on February 22 and Beauregard, although outwardly cooperative and courteous to Johnston, was bitterly disappointed at his replacement. For the remainder of the war, Beauregard was Johnston&#x27;s subordinate, assigned to routine matters without combat responsibilities. Johnston and Beauregard met with President Davis on April 13, and their assessment of the Confederate situation helped convince Davis that Johnston should meet with Sherman to negotiate a surrender of his army. The two surrendered to Sherman near Durham, North Carolina, on April 26, 1865, and were paroled in Greensboro on May 2. Beauregard traveled to Mobile and then took a U.S. naval transport to his hometown of New Orleans. In August that year, Beauregard&#x27;s house was surrounded by troops who suspected he was harboring Edmund Kirby Smith. All the inhabitants were locked in a cotton press overnight. Beauregard complained to General Philip Sheridan who expressed his annoyance at his erstwhile enemy&#x27;s treatment.

==Post-bellum career==
===Later life===
After the war, Beauregard was reluctant to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled him to do so, which he did before the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He was one of many Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by President Andrew Johnson on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief and the bill on his behalf was signed by President Grant on July 24, 1876.

Beauregard pursued a position in the Brazilian Army in 1865, but declined the Brazilians&#x27; offer. He claimed that the positive attitude of President Johnson toward the South swayed his decision. &quot;I prefer to live here, poor and forgotten, than to be endowed with honor and riches in a foreign country.&quot; He also declined offers to take command of the armies of Romania and Egypt.

Beauregard worked to end the harsh penalties levied on Louisiana by Radical Republicans during Reconstruction. His outrage over the perceived excesses of Reconstruction, such as heavy property taxation, was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He was active in the Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of black civil rights and voting, and attempted to form alliances between black and white Louisianians to vote out the Radical Republicans in control of the state legislature.

Beauregard&#x27;s first employment following the war was in October 1865 as chief engineer and general superintendent of the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad. In 1866 he was promoted to president, a position he retained until 1870, when he was ousted in a hostile takeover. This job overlapped with that of president of the New Orleans and Carrollton Street Railway (1866–1876), where he invented a system of cable-powered street railway cars. Once again, Beauregard made a financial success of the company, but was fired by stockholders who wished to take direct management of the company.

In 1869, he demonstrated a cable car and was issued .

After the loss of these two railway executive positions, Beauregard spent time briefly at a variety of companies and civil engineering pursuits, but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited as a supervisor of the Louisiana State Lottery Company in 1877. He and former Confederate general Jubal Early presided over lottery drawings and made numerous public appearances, lending the effort some respectability. For 15 years the two generals served in these positions, but the public became opposed to government-sponsored gambling and the lottery was closed down by the legislature.

Beauregard&#x27;s military writings include &quot;Principles and Maxims of the Art of War&quot; (1863), &quot;Report on the Defense of Charleston&quot;, and &quot;A Commentary on the Campaign and Battle of Manassas&quot; (1891). He was the uncredited co-author of his friend Alfred Roman&#x27;s &quot;The Military Operations of General Beauregard in the War Between the States&quot; (1884). He contributed the article &quot;The Battle of Bull Run&quot; to &quot;Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine&quot; in November 1884. During these years, Beauregard and Davis published a series of bitter accusations and counter-accusations retrospectively blaming each other for the Confederate defeat.

Beauregard served as adjutant general for the Louisiana state militia, 1879–88. During the late nineteenth century the Knights of Labor, an organization for labor advocacy and militancy, organized sugar worker wage strikes. Democratic newspapers began circulating false reports of black-on-white violence from the Knights of Labor, and several states called out militias to break the strikes. In 1887, Democratic Governor John McEnery called for the assistance of ten infantry companies and an artillery company of the state militia. They were to protect black strikebreakers and suppress the wage strikers. A part of the militia arrived to suppress wage strikers in St. Mary Parish, resulting in the Thibodaux Massacre; the Attakapas Rangers led by Captain C. T. Cade joined a sheriff&#x27;s posse facing down a group of sugar strikers. When one of the wage strikers reached into a pocket, posse members opened fire into the crowd, &quot;as many as twenty people&quot; killed or wounded on November 5 in the black village of Pattersonville.

Ultimately, the militia protected some 800 strikebreakers in Terrebone Parish, and captured and arrested 50 wage strikers, mostly for union activities. The Knights of Labor strike collapsed there, and sugar workers returned to the plantations.

In 1888, he was elected as commissioner of public works in New Orleans. When John Bell Hood and his wife died in 1879, leaving ten destitute orphans, Beauregard used his influence to get Hood&#x27;s memoirs published, with all proceeds going to the children. He was appointed by the governor of Virginia to be the grand marshal of the festivities associated with the laying of the cornerstone of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s statue in Richmond. But when Jefferson Davis died in 1889, Beauregard refused the honor of heading the funeral procession, saying &quot;We have always been enemies. I cannot pretend I am sorry he is gone. I am no hypocrite.&quot;

Beauregard died in his sleep in New Orleans. The cause of death was recorded as &quot;heart disease, aortic insufficiency, and probably myocarditis.&quot; Edmund Kirby Smith, the last surviving full general of the Confederacy, served as the &quot;chief mourner&quot; as Beauregard was interred in the vault of the Army of Tennessee in historic Metairie Cemetery.

== Personal life ==
In 1841, Beauregard married Marie Antoinette Laure Villeré (1823–1850), the daughter of a Louisiana sugarcane planter. The two had three children – Rene (1843–1910), Henri (1845–1915), and Laure (1850–1884). Marie died giving birth to the latter, her only daughter. In 1860, Beauregard married Caroline Deslonde (1831–1864), who died in New Orleans following a long illness. Beauregard was Catholic.

Beauregard was related to the inventor/firearms engineer and physician Jean Alexandre LeMat, who had married Beauregard&#x27;s cousin Justine Sophie LePretre in 1849.

==Views on race==
===Treatment by Anglo-Americans due to his Creole heritage===
Beauregard in his young adult years had lived and served primarily with Anglo-Americans in the US army (a rarity for Louisiana Creoles). For the bloody years of the Civil War he fought almost exclusively with Anglo-American Confederates; the prevailing attitudes of his Anglo-American peers were anti-Catholic and anti-foreign, and he was rejected by many of them; they often ignored his opinions during the Civil War, such as his emphasis on the defense of New Orleans and his native Louisiana. In the Confederacy, because he was a Creole Frenchman and seemed different, he was the victim of all kinds of rumors.

An example of these Confederate rumors is his treatment after he was defeated in the Battle of Shiloh; rumors circulated that during the battle he was lying in a tent crying because of sadness and depression. Another rumor from the Confederate media said that the Frenchman was insane and stayed in his quarters fondling a pheasant. They spun the tale that a soldier found a pheasant cowering in a bush and brought it back to Beauregard as a present, and that Beauregard ordered the soldier to cage it as a present for one of his friends. The media claimed that on the day of the battle, both the hopes of a Confederate victory and the bird disappeared with the Creole.

The soldiers who served under Beauregard respected him greatly; here is a quote where a Confederate soldier relates to his father the cheer Beauregard&#x27;s men gave him after the defeat at the Battle of Shiloh:

Non-Creoles continually judged him as being immoral, as he was a favorite of ladies, constantly receiving letters, flags, scarves, writing desks, and flowers. His entourage during the war included a black man from South Carolina named Frederick Maginnis whom Beauregard made his confidant and with whom he talked freely of his war plans, and a young Spaniard who acted as his barber and valet. However, due to the constant need to conform to Anglo-American societal pressures, Beauregard always sought to Americanize himself. One such example was his refusal to use his first name &quot;Pierre&quot;, always signing his name &quot;G.T. Beauregard&quot; in order to not seem foreign to his peers.

As the Civil War ended, Beauregard went back to his native Louisiana, which in the meantime had been under Federal occupation and had adopted many Anglo-American racial policies and attitudes. Beauregard had not been home for years, and just one week after his return to New Orleans, as he was going down a road in Algiers, he was stopped by an Anglo-American man with anti-Creole sentiments. The man screamed at him &quot;I always did believe you were a nigger. Tell me if you are a nigger or not,&quot; and continued his stream of abuse, the result of which caused Beauregard to flee the area.

===Political views after the end of the Civil War===
Reconstruction was a period of great unrest, and resulted in the rise of racial tension and political bipartisanship. Two parties, Republican and Democrat, now controlled the political power in the American Union, and they also had to contend with the lower classes having the right to vote.

In Louisiana, for example, laws had been put in place ever since Louisiana&#x27;s admission into the Union that restricted the vote to only the elite class, the &quot;grands habitants&quot;. These were the aristocratic planters throughout the state; now all men of any class could vote, and the Republicans and Democrats sought supporters. Republicans served mainly Northern interests such as industrialization, while Democrats served mainly Southern interests such as revitalizing the plantation economy. In the South, poor whites began to vote mostly for Democrats, and freed slaves began to vote mostly for Republicans. Voting and racial tensions were being inflamed in the South, causing public demonstrations, fighting, and riots between the groups. New Orleans was split between Democrats and Republicans. Beauregard was insulted, even ridiculed at his home in New Orleans, and had the threat looming of being arrested, exiled, or executed by the Federal Government for having joined the Confederacy.

Beauregard was in a very dark place of his life in 1865. As Reconstruction began, Southern Democrats began to blame the newly emancipated black population of their states for the widespread postwar poverty, destruction, and starvation. Beauregard wrote a letter to his brother-in-law John Slidell in regards to the newly freed slaves; his words echoed the ideas of his embittered Democratic Confederate colleagues, that freed slaves were inferior, ignorant, and indolent; freed slaves had not yet voted in the South, and at this time it did not appear to him that they would. In this period, Beauregard was still a Democrat.

=== Shift toward acceptance ===

==== Political views during the Reconstruction Era ====
In the years following the beginning of Reconstruction, Beauregard&#x27;s opinions changed. Unlike other ex-Confederates, his economic situation improved, and his native home of Louisiana seemed soon to be redeemed from the Reconstruction Period. Beauregard played a prominent vocal role in Louisiana during Reconstruction, and he began writing many letters, gave interviews, and made speeches about almost every issue of that time.

In March 1867, Radical Republicans enforced black suffrage but, when many Southerners became angry and resistant, Beauregard wrote a widely published letter advising Southerners to accept the new situation. He said that the South could either submit or resist, and common sense made it clear that resistance was futile.

Beauregard sought to end the bickering between the Democrats and the Republicans; he felt that by encouraging the cooperation of the races through voting, a better future could be created for the South. His pragmatic change of opinion was exemplified when he argued that emancipated blacks were native to the South, and that all they needed was education and property to take an active interest in Southern politics.

====1868 post-war interview====
In 1868, while Beauregard was vacationing at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, Robert E. Lee invited him to a resort, along with other famous Confederates, as well as William S. Rosecrans, a former Union general and politician. The purpose of the meeting was to combat the Republican charge that the mostly-Democratic Southerners could not be trusted to deal justly with emancipated blacks. The result of the meeting was a document, signed by the parties present, including Beauregard, stating that the South would accept the results of the war and emancipation, and that they felt kindly towards emancipated blacks, although there was opposition to their exercising of political power.

Rosecrans gave an interview upon returning to the north and described Lee&#x27;s efforts as somewhat weak but that Lee was a sincere man. When asked if Beauregard was weak, Rosecrans responded: &quot;By the side of Lee, certainly. Take him alone, however, and he strikes you as quick, ready and incisive — well, a man of the world, a good business character, a smart active Frenchman. But with Lee he dwindles. Lee says shut the door, and Beauregard shuts the door.&quot; When asked by the interviewer if the Southern generals would really allow freed slaves to vote, Rosecrans responded: &quot;Lee will not, probably, but Beauregard will. He is in favor of it and so expressed himself to me.&quot;

====Abraham Lincoln====
Beauregard became a deep admirer of Abraham Lincoln. In 1889, he was personally invited by the president of the Lincoln Memorial League to participate in ceremonies at Springfield, Illinois that were honoring Abraham Lincoln. Beauregard wanted to go, but he was unfortunately unable to make the trip. He replied regretfully that he would be present in spirit to pay homage. Beauregard wrote the following in regards to Abraham Lincoln:

===Political activism===
Beauregard continued voting Republican, but Radical Republicans maintained the heavy taxation of the South; he sought ways to change the economical situation of his state. In a public letter, he endorsed the 1872 Liberal Republican nominee Horace Greeley instead of the Radical Republican candidate Ulysses S. Grant. Beauregard &quot;called for peace, reconciliation, a forgetting of old issues, and a union of conservative-minded people to remove corruption and extravagance from the government&quot;.

In 1872, Beauregard resumed an interest in politics. He was one of the guiding leaders to form the Reform Party of Louisiana, a Southern party made up of Louisiana businessmen, advocating an economical state government, and recognized black civil and political rights. The Reform Party demanded that the South acknowledge black political power. It attempted to replace the Democratic party and sought to end Radical Republican taxation.
In 1873, the Reform Party created a detailed and specific plan to induce cooperation between the races in a political union. The plan called for the creation of the Louisiana Unification Movement. Approving letters and interviews about the movement came flooding into the newspapers. The majority of the communications came from New Orleans businessmen who declared that they were willing to work with blacks, and recognize their political and civil equality if they would agree to cooperate to lower the high taxes and end the inflammation of racial tension. The chant of the Unification movement was &quot;Equal Rights! One Flag! One Country! One People!&quot;

===Louisiana Unification Movement===
Beauregard approached Lieutenant Governor Caesar Antoine, who was a Creole Republican, and invited fifty leading white and fifty black New Orleanian families to join for a meeting on June 16, 1873. The fifty white sponsors were leaders of the community in business, legal and journalistic affairs, and the presidents of almost every corporation and bank in the city attended. The black sponsors were the wealthy, cultured Creoles of color, who were well-off and had been free before the war. Beauregard was the chairman of the resolutions committee. He spoke at the meeting:

The result of the meeting was a report that &quot;advocated complete political equality for blacks, an equal division of state offices between the races, and a plan where blacks would become land owners. It denounced discrimination because of color in hiring laborers or in selecting directors of corporations, and called for the abandonment of segregation in public conveyances, public places, railroads, steams, and public schools.&quot; Beauregard argued that blacks &quot;already had equality and the whites had to accept that hard fact&quot;. 

===Civil rights legacy===
Beauregard lived a paradoxical life. Unlike many ex-Confederates, he did not look back on &quot;the planting South and the mellow glories of the ancient regime&quot; but looked toward the future of the international house of Louisiana, to the industrial district of New Orleans, and a bustling delta of a better tomorrow.

Beauregard was admired by many because of his work after the war, and when he went to a meeting in Waukesha, Wisconsin in 1889, he was given the title by a local reporter of &quot;Sir Galahad of Southern Chivalry&quot;. A Northerner at the meeting welcomed Beauregard, commenting on the fact that 25 years ago, the North &quot;did not feel very kindly toward him; but the past was dead and now they admired him&quot;. Beauregard responded by saying: &quot;As to my past life, I have always endeavored to do my duty under all circumstances, from the point I entered West Point, a boy of seventeen, up to the present&quot;. He was then loudly applauded.

Following Beauregard&#x27;s death in 1893, Victor E. Rillieux, a Creole of color and poet who wrote poems for many famous contemporary civil rights activists, including Ida B. Wells, was moved by Beauregard&#x27;s passing to create a poem titled &quot;Dernier Tribut&quot; ().

==Legacy==
Beauregard&#x27;s residence at 1113 Chartres Street in New Orleans is now called the Beauregard-Keyes House, and is operated as a historic house museum. It was previously owned by American author Frances Parkinson Keyes, who wrote a fictional biography of Beauregard in which the house is an important setting.

Beauregard Parish in western Louisiana is named for him. As was Camp Beauregard, a former U.S. Army base and National Guard camp near Pineville in central Louisiana, until 2023, when it was renamed Louisiana National Guard Training Center Pineville. The unincorporated community of Beauregard, Alabama is also named for him, as is Beauregard, Mississippi. Four camps are named after Beauregard in the Sons of Confederate Veterans.

An equestrian monument by Alexander Doyle in New Orleans depicted him. The monument was removed on May 17, 2017.

Beauregard was portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1999 TNT TV movie &quot;The Hunley&quot;.

Beauregard Hall was an Instructional Building at Nicholls State University. It was renamed as College of Sciences and Technology in 2020.
