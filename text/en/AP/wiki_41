<text>La Monte Thornton Young (born October 14, 1935) is an American composer, musician, and performance artist recognized as one of the first American minimalist composers and a central figure in Fluxus and post-war avant-garde music. He is best known for his exploration of sustained tones, beginning with his 1958 composition &quot;Trio for Strings.&quot; His compositions have called into question the nature and definition of music, most prominently in the text scores of his &quot;Compositions 1960&quot;. While few of his recordings remain in print, his work has inspired prominent musicians across various genres, including avant-garde, rock, and ambient music.

Young played jazz saxophone and studied composition in California during the 1950s, and subsequently moved to New York in 1960, where he was a central figure in the downtown music and Fluxus art scenes. He then became known for his pioneering work in drone music (originally called &quot;dream music&quot;) with his Theatre of Eternal Music collective, alongside collaborators such as Tony Conrad, John Cale, and his wife, the multimedia artist Marian Zazeela.

Since 1962, he has worked extensively with Zazeela, with whom he developed the &quot;Dream House&quot; sound and light environment. In 1964, he began work on his unfinished improvisatory composition &quot;The Well-Tuned Piano&quot;, iterations of which he has performed throughout subsequent decades. Beginning in 1970, he and Zazeela studied under Hindustani singer Pandit Pran Nath. In 2002, Young and Zazeela formed the Just Alap Raga Ensemble with their disciple Jung Hee Choi.

==Biography==

===1935–1959===
Young was born in a log cabin in Bern, Idaho. As a child he was influenced by the droning sounds of the environment, such as blowing wind and electrical transformers. During his childhood, Young&#x27;s family moved several times before settling in Los Angeles, as his father searched for work. He was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He graduated from John Marshall High School. Young began his music studies at Los Angeles City College, and transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he received a BA in 1958. In the jazz milieu of Los Angeles, Young played with notable musicians including Ornette Coleman, Don Cherry, Billy Higgins, and Eric Dolphy. He undertook additional studies at the University of California, Berkeley from 1958 to 1960. In 1959 he attended the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music under Karlheinz Stockhausen, and in 1960 relocated to New York in order to study electronic music with Richard Maxfield at the New School for Social Research. His compositions during this period were influenced by Anton Webern, Gregorian chant, Indian classical music, Japanese Gagaku, and Indonesian gamelan music.

A number of Young&#x27;s early works use the twelve-tone technique, which he studied under Leonard Stein at Los Angeles City College. (Stein had served as an assistant to Arnold Schoenberg when Schoenberg, the inventor of the twelve-tone method, taught at UCLA.) Young also studied composition with Robert Stevenson at UCLA and with Seymore Shifrin at UC Berkeley. In 1958, he developed the &quot;Trio for Strings&quot;, originally scored for violin, viola, and cello, and which presaged his later work. The Trio for Strings has been described as an &quot;origin point for minimalism.&quot; When Young visited Darmstadt in 1959, he encountered the music and writings of John Cage. There he also met Cage&#x27;s collaborator, pianist David Tudor, who subsequently would première some of Young&#x27;s works. At Tudor&#x27;s suggestion, Young engaged in a correspondence with Cage. Within a few months, Young was presenting some of Cage&#x27;s music on the West Coast. In turn, Cage and Tudor included some of Young&#x27;s works in performances throughout the U.S. and Europe. Influenced by Cage, Young at this time took a turn toward the conceptual, using principles of indeterminacy in his compositions and incorporating non-traditional sounds, noises, and actions.

===1960–1969===
Young moved to Downtown New York City in 1960. In the Spring of 1961 he developed an artistic relationship with Fluxus founder George Maciunas at the electronic music course of Richard Maxfield at The New School. Maciunas would go on to design the book &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot;, an artist&#x27;s book publication from the early 1960s, featuring experimental neodada art and music composition that used John Cage–inspired indeterminacy. It was edited by Young and DIY co-published in 1963 by Young and Jackson Mac Low. A few months earlier, in December 1960, Young had curated and organized a series of concert-performances by members of the nascent Fluxus movement at the top floor loft of Yoko Ono at 112 Chambers Street involving visual artists, musicians, dancers and composers — mixing music, visual art and performance together. It was attended by John Cage, Peggy Guggenheim, Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp, among others art world luminaries.

During this period, Young created short, haiku-like, conceptual art but dreamlike scores-texts that have become associated with Fluxus. For example, Young&#x27;s &quot;Compositions 1960&quot; includes a number of unusual actions: some of them un-performable, and constituted an early form of poetic conceptual and post-conceptual art. Most examine a certain presupposition about the nature of music and art by carrying absurd Dada-like concepts to an extreme. One, &quot;Composition 1960 #10 to Bob Morris&quot; instructs: &quot;draw a straight line and follow it&quot; (a directive which Young has said has guided his life and work since). Another instructs the performer to build a fire. Another states that &quot;this piece is a little whirlpool out in the middle of the ocean.&quot; Another says the performer should release a butterfly into the room. Yet another challenges the performer to push a piano through a wall. &quot;Composition 1960 #7&quot; proved especially pertinent to his future endeavors: it consisted of a B, an F#, a perfect fifth, and the instruction: &quot;To be held for a long time.&quot;

In 1962, based on his dream chord, Young wrote &quot;The Second Dream of the High-Tension Line Stepdown Transformer&quot;. One of &quot;The Four Dreams of China&quot;, the piece is based on four pitches, which he later gave as the frequency ratios: 36-35-32-24 (G, C, +C#, D), and limits as to which may be combined with any other. Most of his pieces after this point are based on select pitches, played continuously, and a group of long held pitches to be improvised upon. For &quot;The Four Dreams of China&quot; Young began to plan &quot;Dream House&quot;, a light and sound installation conceived as a dream chord &quot;work that would be played continuously and ultimately exist as a &#x27;living organism with a life and tradition of its own, where musicians would live and create music twenty-four hours a day. He formed the music collective Theatre of Eternal Music to realize &quot;Dream House&quot; and other pieces. The group initially included calligrapher and light artist Marian Zazeela (who married Young in 1963), Angus MacLise, and Billy Name. In 1964 the ensemble comprised Young and Zazeela, John Cale and Tony Conrad (a former Harvard mathematics major), and sometimes Terry Riley (voices). Since 1966 the group has seen many permutations and has included Garrett List, Jon Hassell, Alex Dea, and many others, including members of Young&#x27;s 60s groups.

On September 25, 1965, the Fluxus FluxOrchestra was conducted by Young at Carnegie Recital Hall in New York City, with a program, designed by George Maciunas, folded into paper airplanes and launched during the evening into the audience.

Young and Zazeela&#x27;s first continuous electronic sound environment was created in their loft on Church Street, New York City, in September 1966 with sine wave generators and light sources designed to produce a continuous installation of floating sculptures and color sources, and a series of slides entitled &quot;Ornamental Lightyears Tracery&quot;. This &quot;Dream House&quot; environment was maintained almost continuously from September 1966 to January 1970, being turned off only to listen to &quot;other music&quot; and to study the contrast between extended periods in it and periods of silence. Young and Zazeela worked, sang and lived in it and studied the effects on themselves and visitors. Performances were often extreme in length, conceived by Young as having no beginning and no end, existing before and after any particular performance. In their daily lives, too, Young and Zazeela practiced an artificial sleep–wake cycle—with &quot;days&quot; longer than twenty-four hours.

===1970–present===
As of 1970, Young&#x27;s interests in the music of Asia and his wish to find precedents for the intervals he was using in his minimalist work led him to Indian spiritualist and musician Shyam Batnager who introduced Young to the recordings of Pandit Pran Nath, whose name means Lord of the life-breath in Sanskrit. Impressed, Young would go on to meet and study and perform with Pran Nath for the rest of Pran Nath&#x27;s life through the partial support of the Dia Art Foundation. Fellow students of Pran Nath, included Zazeela, Terry Riley, Rhys Chatham, Jon Hassell, Simone Forti, Shabda Kahn, Jon Gibson, Michael Harrison, Yoshi Wada, Don Cherry, Henry Flynt, Lee Konitz, Charlemagne Palestine and Catherine Christer Hennix.

Young considers &quot;The Well-Tuned Piano&quot;—a permutating composition of themes and improvisations for just-intoned solo piano—to be his masterpiece. Young gave the world premiere of &quot;The Well-Tuned Piano&quot; in Rome in 1974, ten years after the creation of the piece. Previously, he had presented it as a recorded work. In 1975, Young premiered the work in New York, with eleven live performances during the months of April and May. As of October 25, 1981, the date of the Gramavision recording of &quot;The Well-Tuned Piano&quot;, Young had performed the piece 55 times. In 1987, Young performed the piece again as part of a larger concert series that included many more of his works. This performance, on May 10, 1987, was videotaped and released on DVD in 2000 on Young&#x27;s label, &quot;Just Dreams&quot;. Performances have exceeded six hours in length, and so far have only been documented several times. &quot;The Well-Tuned Piano&quot; is strongly influenced by mathematical composition as well as Hindustani classical music practice.

Since the 1970s, Young and Zazeela have realized a long series of semi-permanent &quot;Dream House&quot; installations, which combine Young&#x27;s just-intoned sine waves in elaborate, symmetrical configurations with Zazeela&#x27;s quasi-calligraphic light sculptures. In July 1970 a model short-term &quot;Dream House&quot; was displayed to the public at the gallery Friedrich &amp; Dahlem in Munich, Germany. Later, model &quot;Dream House&quot; environments were presented in various locations in Europe and the United States. In 1974, the two released &quot;Dream House 78&#x27; 17&quot;&quot;. From January through April 19, 2009, &quot;Dream House&quot; was installed in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York as part of &quot;The Third Mind&quot; exhibition. A &quot;Dream House&quot; installation exists today at the MELA Foundation on 275 Church Street, New York, above the couple&#x27;s loft, and is open to the public.

In 2002, Young, with Zazeela and senior disciple Jung Hee Choi, founded the Just Alap Raga Ensemble. This ensemble, performing Indian classical music of the Kirana gharana, merges the traditions of Western and Hindustani classical music, with Young applying his own compositional approach to traditional raga performance, form, and technique.

==Influences==
Young&#x27;s first musical influence came in early childhood in Bern. He relates that &quot;the very first sound that I recall hearing was the sound of wind blowing under the eaves and around the log extensions at the corners of the log cabin&quot;. Continuous sounds—human-made as well as natural—fascinated him as a child. He described himself as fascinated from a young age by droning sounds, such as &quot;the sound of the wind blowing&quot;, the &quot;60 cycle per second drone [of] step-down transformers on telephone poles&quot;, the tanpura drone and the alap of Indian classical music, &quot;certain static aspects of serialism, as in the Webern slow movement of the Symphony Opus 21&quot;, and Japanese gagaku &quot;which has sustained tones in it in the instruments such as the Sho&quot;. The four pitches he later named the &quot;Dream chord&quot;, on which he based many of his mature works, came from his early age appreciation of the continuous sound made by the telephone poles in Bern.

Jazz is one of his main influences; prior to 1956, he planned to devote his career to it. At first, Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh influenced his alto saxophone playing style, and later John Coltrane shaped Young&#x27;s use of the sopranino saxophone. Jazz was, together with Indian music, an important influence on the use of improvisation in his works post-1962. Young discovered Indian music in 1957 on the campus of UCLA. He cites Ali Akbar Khan (sarod) and Chatur Lal (tabla) as particularly significant. The discovery of the &quot;tanpura&quot;, which he learned to play with &quot;Pandit&quot; Pran Nath, was a decisive influence in his interest in long-sustained sounds. Young also acknowledges the influence of Japanese music, especially Gagaku, and Pygmy music.

Young discovered classical music relatively late in life, thanks to his teachers at university. He cites Béla Bartók, Igor Stravinsky, Pérotin, Léonin, Claude Debussy and Organum musical style as important influences. The serialism of Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern had the greatest impact.

Young was also keen to pursue his musical endeavors with the help of psychedelics. Cannabis, LSD and peyote played an important part in Young&#x27;s life from mid-1950s onwards, when he was introduced to them by Terry Jennings and Billy Higgins. He said that &quot;everybody [he] knew and worked with was very much into drugs as a creative tool as well as a consciousness-expanding tool&quot;. This was the case with the musicians of the Theatre of Eternal Music, with whom he &quot;got high for every concert: the whole group&quot;. He considers that the cannabis experience helped him open up to where he went with &quot;Trio for Strings&quot;, though sometimes it proved a disadvantage when performing anything which required keeping track of the number of elapsed bars. He commented on the subject:
==Legacy==
Young&#x27;s use of long tones and just intonation has been extremely influential within Young&#x27;s group of associates: Tony Conrad, Jon Hassell, Rhys Chatham, Michael Harrison, Henry Flynt, Ben Neill, Charles Curtis, and Catherine Christer Hennix. It has also been notably influential on John Cale&#x27;s contribution to The Velvet Underground&#x27;s sound; Cale has been quoted as saying &quot;LaMonte [Young] was perhaps the best part of my education and my introduction to musical discipline.&quot;
His work has inspired prominent musicians across various genres, including fellow minimalist composer Terry Riley, experimental rock groups the Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth, and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno. Eno calls him &quot;the daddy of us all&quot;. In 1981, Eno referred to &quot;X for Henry Flynt&quot; by saying, &quot;It really is a cornerstone of everything I&#x27;ve done since.&quot;

Andy Warhol attended the 1962 première of the static composition by La Monte Young called &quot;Trio for Strings&quot;. Uwe Husslein cites film-maker Jonas Mekas, who accompanied Warhol to the &quot;Trio&quot; premiere, claiming that Warhol&#x27;s static films were directly inspired by the performance. In 1963 Young had joined Warhol&#x27;s musical group The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise music band, but, finding it ridiculous, quit after the second rehearsal. In 1964 Young provided a loud minimalist drone soundtrack to Warhol&#x27;s static films &quot;Kiss&quot;, &quot;Eat&quot;, &quot;Haircut&quot;, and &quot;Sleep&quot; when shown as small TV-sized projections at the entrance lobby to the third New York Film Festival held at Lincoln Center.

Lou Reed&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; notes, &quot;Drone cognizance and harmonic possibilities vis a vis Lamont &quot;(sic)&quot; Young&#x27;s Dream Music&quot; among its &quot;Specifications&quot;.

The album &quot;&quot; by the band Spacemen 3 is influenced by La Monte Young&#x27;s concept of &quot;Dream Music&quot;, evidenced by their inclusion of his notes on the jacket. In 2018, Sonic Boom of Spacemen 3, along with Etienne Jaumet of Zombie Zombie and Indian &quot;dhrupad&quot; singer Céline Wadier, released &quot;Infinite Music: A Tribute to La Monte Young&quot;.

According to Seth Colter Walls, writing in &quot;The Guardian,&quot; while Young has released very little recorded material, with much of it currently out of print, he has had an &quot;outsized influence on other artists.&quot;

Drone rock musician Dylan Carlson has described Young&#x27;s work as being a major influence.

<doc id="98791" wikidata="Q1778029" url="?curid=98791" title="SHRDLU">
<text>SHRDLU is an early natural-language understanding computer program that was developed by Terry Winograd at MIT in 1968–1970. In the program, the user carries on a conversation with the computer, moving objects, naming collections and querying the state of a simplified &quot;blocks world&quot;, essentially a virtual box filled with different blocks.

SHRDLU was written in the Micro Planner and Lisp programming language on the DEC PDP-6 computer and a DEC graphics terminal. Later additions were made at the computer graphics labs at the University of Utah, adding a full 3D rendering of SHRDLU&#x27;s &quot;world&quot;.

The name SHRDLU was derived from ETAOIN SHRDLU, the arrangement of the letter keys on a Linotype machine, arranged in descending order of usage frequency in English.

==Functionality==

SHRDLU is primarily a language parser that allows user interaction using English terms. The user instructs SHRDLU to move various objects around in the &quot;blocks world&quot; containing various basic objects: blocks, cones, balls, etc. What made SHRDLU unique was the combination of four simple ideas that added up to make the simulation of &quot;understanding&quot; far more convincing.

One was that SHRDLU&#x27;s world is so simple that the entire set of objects and locations could be described by including as few as perhaps 50 words: nouns like &quot;block&quot; and &quot;cone&quot;, verbs like &quot;place on&quot; and &quot;move to&quot;, and adjectives like &quot;big&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;. The possible combinations of these basic language building blocks are quite simple, and the program is fairly adept at figuring out what the user means.

SHRDLU also includes a basic memory to supply context. One could ask SHRDLU to &quot;put the green cone on the red block&quot; and then &quot;take the cone off&quot;; &quot;the cone&quot; would be taken to mean the green cone one had just talked about. SHRDLU can search back further through the interactions to find the proper context in most cases when additional adjectives were supplied. One could also ask questions about the history, for instance one could ask &quot;did you pick up anything before the cone?&quot;

A side effect of this memory, and the original rules SHRDLU was supplied with, is that the program can answer questions about what was possible in the world and what was not. For instance, SHRDLU can deduce that blocks could be stacked by looking for examples, but also realize that triangles couldn&#x27;t be stacked, after having tried it. The &quot;world&quot; contains basic physics to make blocks fall over, independent of the language parser.

Finally, SHRDLU can also remember names given to objects, or arrangements of them. For instance one could say &quot;a steeple is a small triangle on top of a tall rectangle&quot;; SHRDLU can then answer questions about steeples in the blocks world, and build new ones.
Here is a famous demonstration of SHRDLU:

:Person: Pick up a big red block.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Grasp the pyramid.
:Computer: I DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND WHICH PYRAMID YOU MEAN.
:Person (changing their mind): Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box.
:Computer: BY &quot;IT&quot;, I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE BLOCK WHICH IS TALLER THAN THE ONE I AM HOLDING.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: What does the box contain?
:Computer: THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLUE BLOCK.
:Person: What is the pyramid supported by?
:Computer: THE BOX.
:Person: How many blocks are not in the box?
:Computer: FOUR OF THEM.
:Person: Is at least one of them narrower than the one which i told you to pick up?
:Computer: YES, THE RED CUBE.
:Person: Is it supported?
:Computer: YES, BY THE TABLE.
:Person: Can the table pick up blocks?
:Computer: NO.
:Person: Can a pyramid be supported by a block?
:Computer: YES.
:Person: Can a pyramid support a pyramid?
:Computer: I DON&#x27;T KNOW.
:Person: Stack up two pyramids.
:Computer: I CAN&#x27;T.
:Person: Will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid?
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Which cube is sitting on the table?
:Computer: THE LARGE GREEN ONE WHICH SUPPORTS THE RED PYRAMID.
:Person: Is there a large block behind a pyramid?
:Computer: YES, THREE OF THEM: A LARGE RED ONE, A LARGE GREEN CUBE, AND THE BLUE ONE.
:Person: Put a small one onto the green cube which supports a pyramid.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Put the littlest pyramid on top of it.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Does the shortest thing the tallest pyramid&#x27;s support supports support anything green?
:Computer: YES, THE GREEN PYRAMID.
:Person: What color is it?
:Computer: BY &quot;IT&quot;, I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE SHORTEST THING THE TALLEST PYRAMID&#x27;S SUPPORT SUPPORTS.
:Computer: RED
:Person: How many things are on top of green cubes?
:Computer: I&#x27;M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY &quot;ON TOP OF&quot; IN THE PHRASE &quot;ON TOP OF GREEN CUBES&quot; .
:DO YOU MEAN:
:1 - DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE
:2 - ANWHERE ON TOP OF ?
:Person: 2
:Computer: THREE OF THEM.
:Person: Had you touched any pyramid before you put the green one on the little cube?
:Computer: YES, THE GREEN ONE.
:Person: When did you pick it up?
:Computer: WHILE I WAS STACKING UP THE RED CUBE, A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN CUBE.
:Person: Why?
:Computer: TO GET RID OF IT.
:Person: Why did you do that?
:Computer: TO CLEAN OFF THE RED CUBE.
:Person: Why did you clear off that cube?
:Computer: TO PUT IT ON A LARGE GREEN CUBE.
:Person: Why did you do that?
:Computer: TO STACK UP THE RED CUBE , A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN CUBE.
:Person: Why did you do that?
:Computer: BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO.
:Person: How did you do it?
:Computer: BY PUTTING A LARGE RED BLOCK ON THE TABLE ; THEN LETTING GO OF IT ; THEN PUTTING A LARGE GREEN CUBE ON IT ; THEN LETTING GO OF THAT CUBE ; THEN PUTTING THE RED CUBE ON THAT CUBE; THEN LETTING GO OF THAT CUBE.
:Person: How many objects did you touch while you were doing it?
:Computer: FOUR OF THEM.
:Person: What did the red cube support before you started to clean it off?
:Computer: THE GREEN PYRAMID.
:Person: There were five blocks to the left of the box then.
:Computer: NO, ONLY FOUR OF THEM: THE RED CUBE, TWO LARGE GREEN CUBES AND A LARGE RED BLOCK.
:Person: Put the blue pyramid on the block in the box.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Is there anything which is bigger than every pyramid but is not as wide as the thing that supports it?
:Computer: YES, THE BLUE BLOCK.
:Person: Does a steeple
:Computer (interrupting): SORRY, I DON&#x27;T KNOW THE WORD &quot;STEEPLE&quot;.
:Person: A &quot;steeple&quot; is a stack which contains two green cubes and a pyramid.
:Computer: I UNDERSTAND.
:Person: Are there any steeples now?
:Computer: NO.
:Person: Build one.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Call the biggest block &quot;superblock&quot;.
:Computer: OK.
:Person: Have you picked superblock up since we began?
:Computer: YES.
:Person: Why did you drop it?
:Computer: BY &quot;IT&quot;, I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE SUPERBLOCK.
:I CAN&#x27;T EXPLAIN A NON-EXISTENT EVENT.
:Person: Is there anything to the right of the red pyramid?
:Computer: YES, FOUR THINGS: THE BOX, THE RED CUBE, THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLOCK NAMED SUPERBLOCK
:Person: Thank you.
:Computer: YOU&#x27;RE WELCOME!

==Consequences==
SHRDLU was considered a tremendously successful demonstration of artificial intelligence (AI). This led other AI researchers to excessive optimism which was soon lost when later systems attempted to deal with situations with a more realistic level of ambiguity and complexity. Subsequent efforts of the SHRDLU type, such as Cyc, have tended to focus on providing the program with considerably more information from which it can draw conclusions.

In a 1991 interview, Winograd said about SHRDLU:
Though not intentionally developed as such, SHRDLU is considered the first known formal example of interactive fiction, as the user interacts with simple commands to move objects around a virtual environment, though lacking the distinct story-telling normally present in the interactive fiction genre. The 1976-1977 game &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; is broadly considered to be the first true work of interactive fiction.

<text>Rene Farrait Nieves (born November 2, 1967) is a Puerto Rican singer, actor, and former member of the boy band Menudo.

After leaving the band, Farrait enjoyed a brief solo career.

In the 1980s, Rene Farrait reunited with former Menudo bandmates Xavier Serbiá, Ray Reyes and Johnny Lozada (Reyes and Farrait were not Menudo members at the same time) and formed a trio called Proyecto M. (Reyes replaced Serbiá as a member of Proyecto M).

In 1998, Farrait joined five other former band members (including Reyes and Lozada) for a comeback tour named &quot;El Reencuentro&quot;.

Following El Reencuentro&#x27;s break up in 2015, Farrait, along with Reyes and fellow former Menudo members Miguel Cancel, Charlie Massó (who had substituted Farrait as member of Menudo) and Robert Avellanet returned to touring, this time being allowed to use the name Menudo again but using the name Menudomania Forever.

== Acting ==
Farrait participated in a film named along with his Menudo bandmates in 1981. When Una aventura llamada Menudo was shot in 1982, Farrait had already left the band; substituted by Charlie Massó; nevertheless, he appeared on the background during parts of the film as one of the film&#x27;s main secondary characters, &quot;Señora Mía&quot;, greatly enjoyed the band&#x27;s last album with Rene on it and had a poster of Rene and his Menudo band-mates in her room.

In 2017, Farrait retook his film career, playing a priest on the Peruvian film &quot;La paisana Jacinta en búsqueda de Wasaberto&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Farrait was married to Carol Maldonado, and later got divorced. He has three daughters and is currently single.

<text>Berga () is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; (county) of Berguedà, in the province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It is bordered by the municipalities of Cercs, Olvan, Avià, Capolat and Castellar del Riu.

== History ==
Berga derives its name from the &quot;Bergistani,&quot; an Iberian tribe which lived in the area before the Roman conquest. The Bergistani were first subdued by Hannibal in 218 BC. They rebelled twice against the Romans and were twice defeated; after their second uprising, much of the tribe was sold into slavery. Livy mentions their principal town, &quot;&quot;, which was probably the precursor of the present-day town of Berga.

Berga was ruled by viscounts in the Early Middle Ages and had its own counts from 988.

Berga was sold to king Peter II of Aragon in 1199.

In May 2012, the town council passed a motion declaring King Juan Carlos &#x27;persona non grata&#x27; following a series of scandals involving the royal family, most notably the king&#x27;s recent elephant hunting trip to Africa in the middle of Spain&#x27;s deepening recession.

== La Patum ==
The Patum de Berga, or simply La Patum, is a popular and traditional festival that is celebrated each year in the city. Locals dress as mystical and symbolic figures, and are accompanied either by the rhythm of a drum (the tabal, whose sound gives the festival its name) or band music.

== Free Software Street ==
On July 3, 2010 the world&#x27;s first Free Software Street was inaugurated in Berga, during a ceremony attended by Richard Stallman.

<text>The national flag of Djibouti is a horizontal flag bicolor with equal bands of light blue and light green, with a white, equilateral triangle at the hoist. In the center of the triangle is a red star. The flag combines the basic layout and colors from the flag of the Front de Libération de la Côte des Somalis. The light blue represents the sky and the sea, as well as the Somalis, green represents the everlasting green of the earth, as well as the Afars, white represents the colour of peace and the five point red star represents unity, the blood shed by the martyrs of independence, as well as Djibouti being one of the five regions inhabited by the Somali people.

Beginning in the mid-19th century before the establishment of the French Somaliland, other flags were used as the flag of the Ottoman Empire, Sultanate of Tajoura and as well religious flags. During the French Somaliland and French Territory of the Afars and the Issas, the only ensign used was the tricolor. The flag was created and designed by the Front for the Liberation of the Somali Coast (FLCS) as the party official flag in the 1960s, which was a guerrilla group who fought for the independence of Djibouti from France. With the help of &quot;Ligue Populaire Africaine pour l&#x27;Indépendance&quot; (LPAI) to independence in 1977. The Djiboutian flag was raised for the first time upon independence on 27 June 1977, by the head of police Yacine Yabeh Galab. It is today flown on many governmental buildings.

==Characteristics==

<doc id="98895" wikidata="Q15385" url="?curid=98895" title="Cerdanya">
<text>Cerdanya (; , ; , ) or often La Cerdanya is a natural comarca and historical region of the eastern Pyrenees divided between France and Spain. Historically it was one of the counties of Catalonia.

Cerdanya has a land area of , divided almost evenly between Spain (50.3%) and France (49.7%). In 2001 its population was approximately 26,500, of whom 53% lived on Spanish territory. Its population density is 24 residents per km² (63 per sq. mile). The only urban area in Cerdanya is the cross-border urban area of Puigcerdà-Bourg-Madame, which contained 10,900 inhabitants in 2001.

The area enjoys a high annual amount of sunshine – around 3,000 hours per year. For this reason, pioneering large-scale solar power projects have been built in several locations in French Cerdagne, including Font-Romeu-Odeillo-Via, the Themis plant near Targassonne, and Mont-Louis Solar Furnace in Mont-Louis.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
The first inhabitants of Cerdanya probably spoke a language related to the old Basque language and to Aquitanian. Many place names testify to this.

In the first millennium BC came the Iberians from the south. In Cerdanya they probably mixed with the native inhabitants, and the resulting people were known as the Kerretes, from the native word &quot;ker&quot; or &quot;kar&quot;, meaning &quot;rock&quot;, related to old Basque &quot;karri&quot; (modern Basque &quot;harri&quot;), &quot;stone&quot;.

The Kerretes were probably essentially of Basque and Aquitanian-related stock, as the Iberian clans who mixed with the native inhabitants can have comprised only small numbers of people. The Kerretes retained a language related to old Basque and Aquitanian, although some Iberian words may have entered the language, and Iberians probably occupied positions at the top of the Kerrete society.

The main oppidum of the Kerretes, commanding the whole country, was called &quot;Kere&quot; and was built on the hill above the modern-day village of Llívia (a Spanish exclave in French territory). Later the Kerretes came under Roman rule, and the Romans renamed the oppidum &quot;Julia Lybica&quot;, with a significant number of Roman citizens settling there. During the Roman Empire, the area of Cerdanya was a &quot;pagus&quot; known as &quot;pagus Liviensis&quot; (a name derived from its capital Julia Lybica), part of the province of Hispania Tarraconensis. The &quot;pagus Liviensis&quot; was itself divided in two: the eastern part around Julia Lybica was known as &quot;Cerretania Julia&quot;, while the western part was known as &quot;Cerretania Augusta&quot;. The name Cerdanya comes from &quot;Cerretania&quot;, itself coming from the old name of the inhabitants, the Kerretes. As for Julia Lybica, the name evolved into &quot;Julia Livia&quot; and then &quot;Llívia&quot;.

The Kerretes seem to have kept their old language until very late, probably as late as the 8th or 9th century. Romanization in the area was extremely slow, even though eventually the native language gave way, and the people in Cerdanya ended up speaking Catalan, a language derived from Latin. At the end of the Roman Empire, Julia Lybica entered a period of decadence, and lost much of its importance. It is around this time that the town of La Seu d&#x27;Urgell (in Catalonia, but outside of Cerdanya) started to replace Julia Lybica as the main center of population in that area of northern Catalonia, and in the 6th century when the diocese (bishopric) of Urgell was founded, Cerdanya was inside its limits.

=== Middle Ages ===
Devastated by the Vandals and other Germanic tribes, Cerdanya was part of the Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse and later Toledo, until eventually it was conquered by the Muslims. After Muslim expansion was halted by Odo the Great in the Battle of Toulouse (721), the Berber commander Uthman ibn Naissa established a small realm in Cerdanya and allied with Odo, so that the Aquitanian leader could secure his south-eastern borders. However, Uthman ibn Naissa came next under Umayyad attack and the Berber lord was defeated, opening the way to Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi&#x27;s expedition into Aquitaine. During Abd al-Rahman I&#x27;s military campaign across the Ebro region (781), the Cordovan commander received the submission of Ibn Belaskut, or Galindo Belascotenes, in Cerdanya. Under Carolingian pressure, Cerdanya became a Frankish vassal about 785.

;County of Cerdanya
The county of Cerdanya has its origin in the Spanish Marches established by Charlemagne. In the 9th century, Cerdanya was one of the lordships united in the person of the counts of Barcelona, who were also counts of Girona, Narbonne, and Urgell. Wilfred the Hairy (count 870–897) had three sons and established the youngest, Miron (died 927), as Count of Cerdanya, a sovereign state.

The sovereign county of Cerdanya bordered the county of Urgell, the county of Barcelona, the county of Besalú, the county of Roussillon, and the county of Razès. The county of Cerdanya was made up of Cerdanya proper with the addition of other areas which it managed to acquire over time through inheritance, such as Capcir and Conflent. Thus, the county of Cerdanya was actually quite an important county. The counts of Cerdanya were great patrons of abbeys, most famously Saint-Michel de Cuxa (Catalan: &quot;Sant Miquel de Cuixà&quot;), dating back to the 10th century and located in Conflent, and Saint-Martin-du-Canigou (Catalan: &quot;Sant Martí del Canigó&quot;), dedicated by Count Guifred of Cerdanya in 1009.

However, the line of the counts died out in 1117 and the county was inherited by the counts of Barcelona, later to become kings of Aragon.

=== Modern times ===

Cerdanya proper was split between Spain and France by the Treaty of the Pyrenees of 1659, with the north of Cerdanya becoming French, while the south of Cerdanya remained Spanish. The counties of Rosselló, Capcir, and Conflent also became French at that time.

Today, the Spanish side of Cerdanya is a Catalan &quot;comarca&quot; known as Baixa Cerdanya (i.e. &quot;Lower Cerdanya&quot;), and whose capital is Puigcerdà. Puigcerdà was already the capital of Cerdanya before the division of 1659, having replaced Hix in 1178 as capital of Cerdanya. Hix, the place where the counts of Cerdanya resided, is now a village inside the commune of Bourg-Madame on the French side of the border. Hix had itself replaced Llívia, which was the ancient capital of Cerdanya in Antiquity. At the Treaty of the Pyrenees it was decided that Llívia would remain Spanish (allegedly because the treaty stipulated that only villages were to be ceded to France, and Llívia was considered a city and not a village, due to its status as the ancient capital of Cerdanya), so Llívia is now an enclave of Spain inside French territory.

The French side of Cerdanya is part of the &quot;département&quot; of Pyrénées-Orientales and has no particular status. People in France refer to it as &quot;Cerdagne française&quot; (that is, &quot;French Cerdanya&quot;), or just &quot;Cerdagne&quot;, while people on the Spanish side refer to it as &quot;Alta Cerdanya&quot; (&quot;Upper Cerdanya&quot;). Its main towns are Bourg-Madame and the ski resort of Font-Romeu.

Despite the split between France and Spain, ties remain between families on both sides of the border, with frequent travel from one country to the other. During World War I, Cerdanya has been the place of an important smuggling trade in which horses and mules went from French to Spanish Cerdanya, before being sold to the French army and going back to France through Le Perthus.

==Municipalities==
===French side===
Known as French Cerdagne (Catalan: &quot;Alta Cerdanya&quot;), it is part of the French department of Pyrénées-Orientales, this one itself part of the Occitanie region. It has no special administrative self-government status apart from that of the department, thus solely being a physiographic region within the department.

===Spanish side=== 
Known as Baixa Cerdanya. Unlike its French counterpart, it does constitute its own administrative division inside the autonomous community of Catalonia as a comarca or county, with its own self-ruling institutions known as the Comarcal Council of Cerdanya, inside the already self-ruling autonomous Catalonia. All municipalities of Baixa Cerdanya are part of the Catalan region of Alt Pirineu, this one itself divided between the Spanish provinces of Lleida and Girona.

== Economy ==
Like neighboring areas of the Pyrenees, Cerdanya relies on tourism to provide strong support for the economy. Spas, skiing, and hiking are long-established attractions. In addition the Yellow Train is a major tourist attraction.

La Cerdanya is best known amongst Barcelona locals and tourists for its skiing. &quot;Masella&quot; ski resort, located close to Urus and Alp, opened on January 3 and, due to the mountain&#x27;s orientation to the North, offers one the longest skiing season in the Pyrenees. The ski station today boasts of 62 slopes with 15 ski lifts, and since 2013, has nocturnal skiing. Physically adjacent to Masella, though requiring a different ski pass, is &quot;La Molina&quot; with 68 ski slopes. Due to La Cerdanya&#x27;s close proximity to Andorra and France, its residents also enjoy skiing in &quot;Font Romeu,&quot; &quot;Formigueres,&quot; &quot;Les Angles,&quot; and &quot;Grandvalira.&quot;

<doc id="98896" wikidata="Q910850" url="?curid=98896" title="Hurricane Lili">
<text>Hurricane Lili was the second costliest, deadliest, and strongest hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, only surpassed by Hurricane Isidore, which affected the same areas around a week before Lili. Lili was the twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm developed from a tropical disturbance in the open Atlantic on September 21. It continued westward, affecting the Lesser Antilles as a tropical storm, then entered the Caribbean. As it moved west, the storm dissipated while being affected by wind shear south of Cuba, and regenerated when the vertical wind shear weakened. It turned to the northwest and strengthened up to category 2 strength on October 1. Lili made two landfalls in western Cuba later that day, and then entered the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane rapidly strengthened on October 2, reaching Category 4 strength that afternoon. It weakened rapidly thereafter, and hit Louisiana as a Category 1 hurricane on October 3. It moved inland and dissipated on October 6.

Lili caused extensive damage through the Caribbean, particularly to crops and poorly built homes. Mudslides were common on the more mountainous islands, particularly Haiti and Jamaica. In the United States, the storm cut off the production of oil within the Gulf of Mexico, and caused severe damage in parts of Louisiana. Lili was also responsible for severe damage to the barrier islands and marshes in the southern portion of the state. Total damage amounted to $925 million (2002 USD), and the storm killed 15 people during its existence.

==Meteorological history==
A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on September 16. A low level center of circulation developed from a tropical disturbance spawned by this tropical wave midway between the African coast and the Caribbean on September 20. The next day, the system gained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression. The depression moved westward in excess of , and reached tropical storm strength-becoming Tropical Storm Lili as it passed through the Windward Islands. The cyclone continued to intensify as it moved west through the Caribbean Sea, reaching an initial peak strength of on the morning of September 24. This was immediately followed by an abrupt weakening, and the storm&#x27;s maximum sustained winds dropped to later that day. The sudden weakening was attributed to strong southerly vertical shear. The system degenerated into an open tropical wave the next morning, and remained in that state for nearly two days.

Lili regenerated near Jamaica on the evening of September 26 and gradually turned more to the west-northwest while strengthening. The system became a hurricane on September 30, just after passing through the Cayman Islands. The storm continued on its course while continuing to intensify, and made landfall twice the next day, on the Isle of Youth and near Pinar del Río as a Category 2 hurricane. Lili emerged over the Gulf of Mexico later that day, having lost little strength during its overland passage.

The system turned to the northwest and sped up, becoming a major hurricane on October 2 while south-southeast of New Orleans. This intensification continued, aided by warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and good outflow. The system reached its peak strength of category 4 intensity, with winds of , during that afternoon.

This strength was not maintained for long. The storm began to quickly weaken in the early morning hours of October 3, and this rapid weakening continued until the hurricane&#x27;s final landfall near Intracoastal City, Louisiana, due to a combination of vertical wind shear, cool waters just offshore Louisiana, and slowly encroaching dry air within its southwest quadrant. By the time of landfall, maximum sustained winds had dropped to . The weakening was accompanied by a collapse of the inner eyewall before landfall. The system continued inland, curving to the north-northeast, and dissipated when absorbed by an extratropical low near the Arkansas/Tennessee border on October 6.

==Preparations==

Tropical storm watches were issued in parts of the Lesser Antilles on September 22. These were upgraded to warnings the next afternoon, and all advisories were dropped late on September 23 once the storm had passed. Over the next week, the islands of Hispaniola, Jamaica, Cuba, the Caymans, and the Yucatán Peninsula were all under advisories of some kind at different times. Hurricane and tropical storm watches were issued for the Gulf Coast on October 1, and were upgraded to warnings the next morning. They were discontinued after the storm moved past the following day.
Preparations in most of the Lesser Antilles were minimal as the storm only hit as a tropical storm. Two hundred people evacuated their homes in advance of the storm on the islands of St. Vincent and Grenadine. In Jamaica, all schools and universities were closed in advance of the storm, and 17 public shelters were opened on the island.

Preparations were extensive in Cuba. Military officials at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp prepared for the possibility of evacuating their Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. A total of 130,000 Cuban citizens, mainly in western portions of the island, evacuated their homes prior to the storm.

Significant action was taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed, predicted to come ashore at Category Four strength, became more urgent. Over a half million people evacuated their homes in Texas and Louisiana, including everyone in Iberia Parish. A total of 200,000 people evacuated in Louisiana. At least 2,000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. More than 20,000 people stayed in those shelters. The Red Cross also sent over 160,000 meals to the area. A total of 3,000 prison inmates in Texas were evacuated to safer inland locations. The launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was delayed for five days when the Kennedy Space Center was threatened by the storm, the first time a launch in Florida had been delayed because of weather in Houston. Stores across the warning area were very busy in advance of the storm. In New Iberia, Louisiana, hardware stores ran out of stock, and businesses in Lafayette, Louisiana reported similar shortages.

Collegiate activities were also affected by the storm. Southern University canceled four days of classes because of Lili, and 20 Texas A&amp;M University Galveston, Texas students evacuated to the school&#x27;s College Station location. The University of South Alabama canceled two athletic events in advance of the storm.

==Impact==

Hurricane Lili was both the second deadliest and the second most devastating hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season (Isidore killed 22 people and damaged $1.28 billion worth of property). A total of 13 people died in the Caribbean Islands, and 2 more were killed in the United States. Severe damage to crops and livestock occurred through the Lesser Antilles, and damage to buildings and other infrastructure was reported in other Caribbean nations and the United States.

===Lesser Antilles===
Lili affected the islands as a tropical storm. Winds in the area were generally below hurricane force, although some gusts exceeded . Rainfall of up to caused deadly mudslides. The winds, combined with poor construction, tore the roofs off numerous homes and businesses. The majority of the damage was dealt to primarily to the banana crop.

St. Lucia lost at least 75 percent of its banana crop, and hundreds of homes were damaged by the strong winds. Near total loss of electricity, water, and telephone services occurred, and utility systems were heavily damaged. Four people were killed on the island, and total damage was estimated at $20 million (2002 USD)

Over 400 homes were damaged in Barbados, and nearly 50 trees were downed by the high gusts. Similar to in St. Lucia, there was significant damage to the nation&#x27;s banana crop. Extensive loss of electricity and telephone service also occurred. Damage totaled at nearly $200,000 (2002 USD).

Grenada also experienced moderate damage. A total of 14 homes&#x27; roofs
were damaged, and one was completely destroyed. The island Medical Centre&#x27;s roof was also damaged, and 12 landslides were reported. There was also mild damage to infrastructure, particularly in St. Patrick&#x27;s Parish; three bridges were damaged or destroyed, along with seven utility poles and a water main. The entire island was without power at some point, but it was quickly restored in the southern part of the island where damage to the poles themselves was less significant.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines were heavily damaged, especially compared to other islands in the area. Several hundred homes and two schools were damaged, and the Rose Hall Police Station&#x27;s roof was lost. Still, the majority of damage was dealt to the agricultural industry. In all, damage to the islands totaled $40 million (2002 USD).

===Haiti===

Lili passed offshore of Haiti as a weakening tropical storm. The storm&#x27;s major impact was extremely heavy rainfall, in excess of near the settlement of Camp-Perrin, Haiti. This caused the Ravine du Sud River to overflow, and submerge buildings in the town. Two people died in the mudslides these rains triggered, and two more drowned in the flooding around Camp-Perrin. The floods also seriously damaged crops and infrastructure; over 1700 homes were damaged and 240 were destroyed. Haiti was affected dramatically and many towns and villages submerged into rivers exceeding their bankfull discharge

===Jamaica===
Lili affected Jamaica as a strengthening tropical storm. Wind gusts in excess of and rainfall over resulted in damage to homes, crops, and utility systems.

Extremely heavy rainfall inundated the island. Cedar Valley recorded the most rainfall, with measured. This led to prolific flooding that triggered mudslides across the island and killed four people. These floods decimated the island&#x27;s sugar cane crop, one of the island&#x27;s principal exports. The resultant flooding caused widespread problems with the infrastructure of the island. All of the island&#x27;s hospitals had flood damage, and three were also dealt structural damage by the strong winds. The flooding caused latrines and other sewage sources to overflow into the intake sources for the water supply, leading to fear of disease.

===Cuba===

Lili made landfall as a category two hurricane twice in Cuba, on the Isle of Youth and in the Pinar del Río Province, on October 1. Wind gusts up to and rainfall amounts reaching in some places caused damage to homes, businesses and crops. One person was killed.

Damage to buildings and other infrastructure was significant. The most severely affected provinces were Pinar del Río and La Habana. A total of 48,000 homes were damaged, 16,000 of them lost their roofs. The province Sancti Spiritus was not affected as severely, as only 945 homes were damaged, with 500 losing their roofs. The provinces in Eastern Cuba, including Guantanamo, suffered similar damage. Electricity outages for whole towns lasted weeks in parts of the western provinces. This led to loss of running water due to unpowered pumps, and deliveries of fresh water had to be made to remote villages. The tobacco and rice crops were badly depleted, but it was difficult to differentiate how much damage was caused by Lili, since Isidore had struck the region just a week earlier.

===Louisiana===

Lili made landfall on the morning of October 3 near Intracoastal City, as a weakening category one hurricane. Wind gusts reaching , coupled with over of rainfall and a storm surge of caused over $790 million (2002 USD) in damage to Louisiana. A total of 237,000 people lost power, and oil rigs offshore were shut down for up to a week. Crops were badly affected, particularly the sugar cane, damage totaled nearly $175 million (2002 USD). No direct deaths were reported as early warnings and the compact nature of the storm circumvented major loss of life.

Vermillion Parish, the point of landfall, was hardest hit. Wind gusts in excess of , along with a storm surge of dealt major damage to nearly 4000 homes. The worst storm surge flooding occurred in Intracoastal City, destroying 20 buildings owned by a helicopter company. One person died after the storm, and 20 were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning.
Acadia Parish was also hard hit, recording wind gusts exceeding , and 5 tornadoes touched down in the parish. Thousands of homes were damaged with over 2,500 suffering severe damage. Power across the parish was knocked out, 2 people were injured and one was killed after the storm. Schools in the parish also sustained $1.6 million (2002 USD) in damage.

===Mississippi===
Lili&#x27;s outer rainbands dumped large amounts of rain and brought tropical storm force wind gusts to Mississippi. Pascagoula, Mississippi, recorded wind gusts of , and Picayune, Mississippi, received of rainfall. Minor power outages occurred, mainly in southern Mississippi, and combined with the flooding of roads and buildings caused $30 million (2002 USD) in damage. No deaths occurred in Mississippi.

===Other areas in the United States===
Hurricane Lili&#x27;s remnants brought heavy rainfall, peaking at four inches in Arkansas, to the Southeast, before dissipating near the Arkansas-Tennessee border. Lili&#x27;s remnants also caused minimal rainfall in the Lower Tennessee Valley. No major damage was reported.

==Aftermath==

President Bush declared Louisiana a federal disaster area after the storm, making it eligible for assistance. FEMA set up three locations to apply in Mississippi and Louisiana. Applications began pouring in, 153,000 by the time of the deadline. Over $311 million in aid was granted to Louisiana. A total of $50 million of that money was in the form of low interest loans, and not actual grants.

Over 1,000 power workers from eight different states went to the worst hit areas to help restore power. Seven states sent tree trimmers to help clear debris from power lines and roads to speed the recovery process. In addition, FEMA gave SLEMCO, the state&#x27;s power company, an $8.6 million grant, which paid for 75% of the damage to the electrical grid there. It took up to four weeks to restore power to all customers.

Hurricane Lili caused great environmental damage to the marshes and barrier islands in Louisiana. Huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The barrier islands to the east of the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were severely eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.

===Retirement===

Due to the widespread and heavy damage caused by the hurricane, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Lili&quot; in the spring of 2004. It was replaced with &quot;Laura&quot; for the 2008 season.

<doc id="98904" wikidata="Q991765" url="?curid=98904" title="Bruce Paltrow">
<text>Bruce Weigert Paltrow (November 26, 1943 – October 3, 2002) was an American television and film director and producer. He was the husband of actress Blythe Danner, and the father of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and screenwriter/director Jake Paltrow.

==Life and career==
Paltrow was born in Brooklyn, the son of Dorothy (née Weigert) and Arnold Paltrow (&quot;né&quot; Paltrowitz). He had a brother, Robert. He was a first cousin of Spencer J. Giffords, father of Gabby Giffords, who became an American politician and member of the United States House of Representatives. His family was of Eastern European Jewish descent with roots in Minsk. His paternal great-grandfather, whose surname was Paltrowicz, was a Rabbi in Novogrudok. His father and mother owned Paltrow Steel Company and a home in Palm Beach, Florida.

Paltrow studied painting at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. In the late 1960s, he began directing stage productions in New York City, where he met actress Blythe Danner. They were married from December 14, 1969, until his death.

He was the producer of the television series &quot;The White Shadow&quot; and &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;. His last production was the film &quot;Duets&quot;, which starred his daughter Gwyneth.

He also owned a restaurant in Aspen called Gordon&#x27;s.

Paltrow identified himself as a Democrat. He reportedly refused to cast Dwight Schultz for a role on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; because the actor, a political conservative, supported Ronald Reagan.

==Death and legacy==
Paltrow died on October 3, 2002, aged 58, while vacationing in Rome, Italy, to celebrate his daughter&#x27;s 30th birthday. He had been diagnosed with oral cancer in 1999; his death was due to complications from oral cancer and pneumonia.

In 2007, his widow Blythe Danner, in co-operation with The Oral Cancer Foundation, set up a fund in his name to address oral cancer issues in the United States. The foundation works primarily in the areas of public awareness, early detection, patient support functions and research.

In 2002, three weeks after Paltrow&#x27;s death, his daughter Gwyneth met Coldplay singer Chris Martin, whom she married in 2003. The 2005 Coldplay album &quot;X&amp;Y&quot; carried a dedication to Bruce Paltrow, and the song &quot;Fix You&quot; was written to help Gwyneth through her grief.

<text>János Bolyai (; ; 15 December 1802 – 27 January 1860) or Johann Bolyai, was a Hungarian mathematician who developed absolute geometry—a geometry that includes both Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry. The discovery of a consistent alternative geometry that might correspond to the structure of the universe helped to free mathematicians to study abstract concepts irrespective of any possible connection with the physical world.

==Early life==
Bolyai was born in the town of Kolozsvár, Grand Principality of Transylvania (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania), the son of Zsuzsanna Benkő and the well-known mathematician Farkas Bolyai.

By the age of 13, he had mastered calculus and other forms of analytical mechanics, receiving instruction from his father. He studied at the Imperial and Royal Military Academy (TherMilAk) in Vienna from 1818 to 1822, and Bolyai received his commission as sub-lieutenant. At the age of 21, he was already a lieutenant, at the age of 22, a first lieutenant and at the age of 24, a captain.

==Career==
Bolyai became so obsessed with Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate that his father, who had pursued the same subject for many years, wrote to him in 1820: &quot;You must not attempt this approach to parallels. I know this way to the very end. I have traversed this bottomless night, which extinguished all light and joy in my life. I entreat you, leave the science of parallels alone...Learn from my example.&quot;

János, however, persisted in his quest and eventually came to the conclusion that the postulate is independent of the other axioms of geometry and that different consistent geometries can be constructed on its negation. In 1823, he wrote to his father: &quot;I have discovered such wonderful things that I was amazed...out of nothing I have created a strange new universe.&quot; Between 1820 and 1823 he had prepared a treatise on parallel lines that he called absolute geometry. Bolyai&#x27;s work was published in 1832 as an appendix to a mathematics textbook by his father.

Carl Friedrich Gauss, on reading the Appendix, wrote in a letter, &quot;I regard this young geometer Bolyai as a genius of the first order.&quot; To his old friend Farkas Bolyai, however, Gauss wrote: &quot;To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work...coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.&quot; Indeed, Gauss had disclosed his discovery of a consistent non-Euclidean geometry in a letter in 1827, and in 1829 wrote that he feared backlash if he published about it. János suspected that Gauss had been secretly informed about his discoveries by his father, causing a rift between him and his father. He later bitterly complained about Gauss&#x27;s attitude. 

In 1848 Bolyai learned that Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky had published a piece of work similar to his appendix in 1829. Though Lobachevsky published his work a few years earlier than Bolyai, it contained only hyperbolic geometry. Working independently, Bolyai and Lobachevsky pioneered the investigation of non-Euclidean geometry.

In addition to his work in geometry, Bolyai developed a rigorous geometric concept of complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers. Although he never published more than the 24 pages of the Appendix, he left more than 20,000 pages of mathematical manuscripts when he died. These can now be found in the Teleki-Bolyai Library in Târgu Mureș, where Bolyai died. His grave lies in the Lutheran Cemetery in Târgu Mureș.

==Personal life==
He was an accomplished linguist, speaking several foreign languages beside his native Hungarian, these being German, Latin, French, Italian and Romanian. He learned the violin and performed in Vienna.
 
No original portrait of Bolyai survives. An unauthentic picture appears in some encyclopedias and on a Hungarian postage stamp.

==Legacy==
The Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, that was established in 1959, bears his name, as does the professional society of Hungarian mathematicians, the János Bolyai Mathematical Institute, at the University of Szeged. There is also a mathematical award given out every five years, named the Bolyai Prize. Bolyai is a minor character in the 1969 science-fiction/fantasy story &quot;Operation Changeling&quot;, where his unique abilities allow the protagonists to navigate the non-Euclidean geometry of Hell.

The crater Bolyai on the Moon and 1441 Bolyai, a minor planet discovered in 1937, are also named after him. 

Several primary and secondary schools in the Carpathian Basin also bear Bolyai&#x27;s name; for instance, Bolyai János Műszaki Szakközépiskola in Budapest, Bolyai János Gyakorló Általános Iskola és Gimnázium in Szombathely, and the Bolyai János Általános Iskola in Debrecen. Streets in Budapest, Cluj-Napoca, and Timișoara are named after Bolyai.

<text>Joseph Wolstenholme (30 September 1829 – 18 November 1891) was an English mathematician.

Wolstenholme was born in Eccles near Salford, Lancashire, England, the son of a Methodist minister, Joseph Wolstenholme, and his wife, Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; Clarke. He graduated from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge as Third Wrangler in 1850 and was elected a fellow of Christ&#x27;s College in 1852. Collaborating with Percival Frost, a &quot;Treatise on Solid Geometry&quot; was published in 1863.

Wolstenholme served as Examiner in 1854, 1856, and 1863 for Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, and according to Andrew Forsyth his book &quot;Mathematical Problems&quot; made a significant contribution to mathematical education:
:...gathered together from many examination papers to form a volume, which was considerably amplified in later editions, they exercised a very real influence upon successive generations of undergraduates; and &quot;Wolstenholme&#x27;s Problems&quot; have proved a help and stimulus to many students.
In 1869 he resigned his fellowship to marry Térèse Kraus, his Swiss bride. 
He became a professor of mathematics at the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper&#x27;s Hill, Egham, Surrey from 1871 to 1889. 
In 1878 he published an expanded version of &quot;Mathematical Problems&quot;, and in 1888 &quot;Examples for Practice in the Use of Seven-figure Logarithms&quot;.

He was a close friend of Leslie Stephen from his undergraduate studies at Cambridge. Virginia Woolf used his personality for the character Augustus Carmichael in her novel &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;. His sister was the feminist Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy.

<text>Georg Ernst Stahl (22 October 1659 – 24 May 1734) was a German chemist, physician and philosopher. He was a supporter of vitalism, and until the late 18th century his works on phlogiston were accepted as an explanation for chemical processes.

Raised as a son to a Lutheran pastor, he was brought up in a very pious and religious household. From an early age he expressed profound interest in chemistry, by age 15 mastering a set of university lecture notes on chemistry and eventually a difficult treatise by Johann Kunckel. He had two wives, who both died from puerperal fever in 1696 and 1706. He also had a son Johnathan and a daughter who died in 1708. He continued to work and publish following the death of both of his wives and eventually his children, but was often very cold to students and fell into deep depression until his death in 1734 at the age of 74.

He was born in St. John&#x27;s parish in Ansbach, Brandenburg, on October 22, 1659. His father was Johann Lorentz Stahl (1620–1698). He was raised in Pietism, which influenced his viewpoints on the world. His interests in chemistry were due to the influence a professor of medicine, Jacob Barner, and a chemist, Johann Kunckel von Löwenstjern. In the late 1670s, Stahl moved to Saxe-Jena to study medicine at the University of Jena. Stahl&#x27;s success at Jena earned him a M.D. around 1683 and then he went on to teach at the same university.

Teaching at the university gained him such a good reputation that in 1687 he was hired as the personal physician to Duke Johann Ernst of Sachsen-Weimar. In 1693, he joined his old college friend Friedrich Hoffmann at the University of Halle. In 1694, he held the chair of medicine at the University of Halle. From 1715 until his death, he was the physician and counselor to King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia and in charge of Berlin&#x27;s Medical Board.

==Medicine==
Stahl&#x27;s focus was on the distinction between the living and nonliving. Although he did not support the views of iatro-mechanists, he believed that all non-living creatures are mechanical and so are living things to a certain degree. His views were that nonliving things are stable throughout time and did not rapidly change. On the other hand, living things are subject to change and have a tendency to decompose, which led Stahl to work with fermentation.

Stahl professed an animistic system, in opposition to the materialism of Hermann Boerhaave and Friedrich Hoffmann. His main argument on living things was that there is an agent responsible for delaying this decomposition of living things and that agent is the &quot;anima&quot; or soul of the living organism. The &quot;anima&quot; controls all of the physical processes that happen in the body. It not only just controls the mechanical aspects of it but the direction and goals of them too. How the anima controls these processes is through motion. He believed that the three important motions of the body are the circulation of blood, excretion and secretion.

These beliefs were reflected in his views on medicine. He thought that medicine should deal with the body as a whole and its &quot;anima&quot;, rather than the specific parts of a body. Having knowledge on the specific mechanical parts of the body is not very useful. His views had been criticized by Gottfried Leibniz, with whom he exchanged letters, later published in a book titled &quot;Negotium otiosum seu σκιαμαχία&quot; (1720). Also, during the first part of the 18th century, Stahl&#x27;s ideas on the non-physical part of the body were disregarded while his mechanistic ideas on the body were accepted in the works of Boerhaave and Hoffmann.

===Tonic motion===
As a physician, Stahl worked with patients and focused on the soul, or &quot;anima&quot;, as well as blood circulation and tonic motion. &quot;Anima&quot; was a vital force that when working properly would allow the subject to be healthy; however, when malfunction of the &quot;anima&quot; occurred, so did illness. Tonic motion, to Stahl, involved the contracting and relaxing movements of the body tissue in order to serve the three main purposes. Tonic motion helped explain how animals produce heat and how fevers were caused. In Stahl&#x27;s 1692 dissertation, &quot;De motu tonico vitali,&quot; Stahl explains his theory of tonic motion and how it is connected to blood flow within a subject, without citing William Harvey&#x27;s blood flow and circulation theories, which lacked an explanation of irregular blood flow. Also within the dissertation, &#x27;practitioners&#x27; are mentioned as users of his theory of tonic motion.

Stahl&#x27;s theory of &quot;tonic motion&quot; was about the muscle tone of the circulatory system. During his work at Halle, Stahl oversaw patients experiencing headaches and nosebleeds. Tonic motion explained these phenomena as blood needed a natural or artificial path to flow when a part of the body is obstructed, injured, or swollen. Stahl also experimented with menstruation, finding that bloodletting in an upper portion of the body would relieve bleeding during the period. During the next period, the wound would experience pain and swelling, which would only be relieved by an opening in the foot. He also followed this procedure as a treatment for amenorrhoea.

==Chemistry==
The best of Stahl&#x27;s work in chemistry was done while he was a professor at Halle. Just like medicine, he believed that chemistry could not be reduced to mechanistic views. Although he believed in atoms, he did not believe that atomic theories were enough to describe the chemical processes that go on. He believed that atoms could not be isolated individually and that they join to form elements. He took an empirical approach when establishing his descriptions of chemistry.

Stahl used the works of Johann Joachim Becher to help him come up with explanations of chemical phenomena. The main theory that Stahl got from J. J. Becher was the theory of phlogiston. This theory did not have any experimental basis before Stahl. Becher&#x27;s theories attempted in explaining chemistry as comprehensively as seemingly possible through classifying different earths according to specific reactions. &quot;Terra pinguis&quot; was a substance that escaped during combustion reactions, according to Becher. Stahl, influenced by Becher&#x27;s work, developed his theory of phlogiston. Phlogiston theory did not have any experimental basis before Stahl worked with metals and various other substances in order separate phlogiston from them. Stahl proposed that metals were made of calx, or ash, and phlogiston and that once a metal is heated, the phlogiston leaves only the calx within the substance. He was able to make the theory applicable to chemistry as it was one of the first unifying theories in the discipline. Phlogiston provided an explanation of various chemical phenomena and encouraged the chemists of the time to rationally work with the theory to explore more of the subject. This theory was later replaced by Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier&#x27;s theory of oxidation and caloric theory. He also propounded a view of fermentation, which in some respects resembles that supported by Justus von Liebig a century and half later. Although his theory was replaced, Stahl&#x27;s theory of phlogiston is seen to be the transition between alchemy and chemistry.

Stahl is credited for being among the first to describe carbon monoxide as noxious &quot;carbonarii halitus&quot; (carbonic vapors) in his 1697 publication &quot;Zymotechnia fundamentalis.&quot;

<text>A bolometer is a device for measuring radiant heat by means of a material having a temperature-dependent electrical resistance. It was invented in 1878 by the American astronomer Samuel Pierpont Langley.

== Principle of operation ==
A bolometer consists of an absorptive element, such as a thin layer of metal, connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal link. The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir – the greater the absorbed power, the higher the temperature. The intrinsic thermal time constant, which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal conductance between the absorptive element and the reservoir. The temperature change can be measured directly with an attached resistive thermometer, or the resistance of the absorptive element itself can be used as a thermometer. Metal bolometers usually work without cooling. They are produced from thin foils or metal films. Today, most bolometers use semiconductor or superconductor absorptive elements rather than metals. These devices can be operated at cryogenic temperatures, enabling significantly greater sensitivity.

Bolometers are directly sensitive to the energy left inside the absorber. For this reason they can be used not only for ionizing particles and photons, but also for non-ionizing particles, any sort of radiation, and even to search for unknown forms of mass or energy (like dark matter); this lack of discrimination can also be a shortcoming. The most sensitive bolometers are very slow to reset (i.e., return to thermal equilibrium with the environment). On the other hand, compared to more conventional particle detectors, they are extremely efficient in energy resolution and in sensitivity. They are also known as thermal detectors.

== Langley&#x27;s bolometer ==

The first bolometers made by Langley consisted of two steel, platinum, or palladium foil strips covered with lampblack. One strip was shielded from radiation and one exposed to it. The strips formed two branches of a Wheatstone bridge which was fitted with a sensitive galvanometer and connected to a battery. Electromagnetic radiation falling on the exposed strip would heat it and change its resistance. By 1880, Langley&#x27;s bolometer was refined enough to detect thermal radiation from a cow a quarter of a mile (400 m) away. This radiant-heat detector is sensitive to differences in temperature of one hundred-thousandth of a degree Celsius (0.00001 °C). This instrument enabled him to thermally detect across a broad spectrum, noting all the chief Fraunhofer lines. He also discovered new atomic and molecular absorption lines in the invisible infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Nikola Tesla personally asked Dr. Langley whether he could use his bolometer for his power transmission experiments in 1892. Thanks to that first use, he succeeded in making the first demonstration between West Point and his laboratory on Houston Street.

== Applications in astronomy ==

While bolometers can be used to measure radiation of any frequency, for most wavelength ranges there are other methods of detection that are more sensitive. For sub-millimeter wavelengths through millimeter wavelengths (from around 200 μm to a few mm wavelength, also known as the far-infrared, terahertz) bolometers are among the most sensitive available detectors, and are therefore used for astronomy at these wavelengths. To achieve the best sensitivity, they must be cooled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero (typically from 50 mK to 300 mK). Notable examples of bolometers employed in submillimeter astronomy include the Herschel Space Observatory, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Recent examples of bolometers employed in millimeter-wavelength astronomy are AdvACT, BICEP array, SPT-3G and the HFI camera on the Planck satellite, as well as the planned Simons Observatory, CMB-S4 experiment, and LiteBIRD satellite.

== Applications in particle physics ==

The term bolometer is also used in particle physics to designate an unconventional particle detector. They use the same principle described above. The bolometers are sensitive not only to light but to every form of energy.
The operating principle is similar to that of a calorimeter in thermodynamics. However, the approximations, ultra low temperature, and the different purpose of the device make the operational use rather different. In the jargon of high energy physics, these devices are not called &quot;calorimeters&quot;, since this term is already used for a different type of detector (see Calorimeter). Their use as particle detectors was proposed from the beginning of the 20th century, but the first regular, though pioneering, use was only in the 1980s because of the difficulty associated with cooling and operating a system at cryogenic temperature. They can still be considered to be at the developmental stage.

== Applications in plasma physics ==

Bolometers play a pivotal role in monitoring radiation in fusion plasmas. The Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator employs a two-camera bolometer system to capture plasma radiation. This setup is optimized to identify 2D radiation distributions within a symmetrical triangular plasma cross-section. Recent progress includes the refinement of a tomographic reconstruction algorithm, which leans on the principle of relative gradient smoothing (RGS) of emission profiles. This has been effectively applied to the W7-X hydrogen discharges powered by electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH). In terms of hardware, the W7-X bolometers are equipped with metal-resistive detectors. These are distinguished by a 5 μm thick gold absorber, sized 1.3 mm in the poloidal direction and 3.8 mm toroidally, mounted on a ceramic (silicon nitride Si3N4) substrate. The inclusion of a 50 nm carbon layer is strategic, enhancing the detection efficiency for low-energy photons. These detectors are notably attuned to impurity line radiation, covering a spectrum from the very ultraviolet (VUV) to soft x-rays (SXR). Given their resilience and innovative design, they are being considered as prototypes for the upcoming ITER bolometer detectors.

==Microbolometers==
A microbolometer is a specific type of bolometer used as a detector in a thermal camera. It is a grid of vanadium oxide or amorphous silicon heat sensors atop a corresponding grid of silicon. Infrared radiation from a specific range of wavelengths strikes the vanadium oxide or amorphous silicon, and changes its electrical resistance. This resistance change is measured and processed into temperatures which can be represented graphically. The microbolometer grid is commonly found in three sizes, a 640×480 array, a 320×240 array (384×288 amorphous silicon) or less expensive 160×120 array. 640x512 VOx arrays are commonly used in static security camera applications with low shock resistance requirements. Different arrays provide the same resolution with larger array providing a wider field of view. Larger, 1024×768 arrays were announced in 2008.

==Hot electron bolometer==
The hot electron bolometer (HEB) operates at cryogenic temperatures, typically within a few degrees of absolute zero. At these very low temperatures, the electron system in a metal is weakly coupled to the phonon system. Power coupled to the electron system drives it out of thermal equilibrium with the phonon system, creating hot electrons. Phonons in the metal are typically well-coupled to substrate phonons and act as a thermal reservoir. In describing the performance of the HEB, the relevant heat capacity is the electronic heat capacity and the relevant thermal conductance is the electron-phonon thermal conductance.

If the resistance of the absorbing element depends on the electron temperature, then the resistance can be used as a thermometer of the electron system. This is the case for both semiconducting and superconducting materials at low temperature. If the absorbing element does not have a temperature-dependent resistance, as is typical of normal (non-superconducting) metals at very low temperature, then an attached resistive thermometer can be used to measure the electron temperature.

==Microwave measurement==
A bolometer can be used to measure power at microwave frequencies. In this application, a resistive element is exposed to microwave power. A dc bias current is applied to the resistor to raise its temperature via Joule heating, such that the resistance is matched to the waveguide characteristic impedance. After applying microwave power, the bias current is reduced to return the bolometer to its resistance in the absence of microwave power. The change in the dc power is then equal to the absorbed microwave power. To reject the effect of ambient temperature changes, the active (measuring) element is in a bridge circuit with an identical element not exposed to microwaves; variations in temperature common to both elements do not affect the accuracy of the reading. The average response time of the bolometer allows convenient measurement of the power of a pulsed source.

In 2020, two groups reported microwave bolometers based on graphene-based materials capable of microwave detection at the single-photon level.

<text>Joseph Easton Gary (July 9, 1821October 31, 1906) was an American lawyer and judge in the state of Illinois. He served over 40 years as a judge of the Superior Court of Cook County, including eight years as judge of the Illinois Appellate Court for the Cook County district. He infamously presided over the trial of eight anarchists for their alleged role in the Haymarket Riot, and sentenced seven of them to death despite a lack of a clear connection to the bomber.

==Early life==
Joseph Gary was born in Potsdam, New York. As a young man he worked as a carpenter, following the trade of his father. He then moved to St. Louis in 1843 to study law and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He practiced for five years in Springfield, Missouri, then moved to Las Vegas in 1849 and established a practice there. At the time, Las Vegas was a small settlement in what was then the State of Deseret. After three years, he moved to San Francisco, California, and then to Berlin, Wisconsin. He finally settled in Chicago in 1856, and remained there for the rest of his life.

== Judicial service ==
In 1863, Gary was elected as a judge of the Superior Court of Chicago (which was in 1870 renamed the &quot;Superior Court of Cook County&quot;). He ceased practicing law after becoming a judge. Gary was re-elected in 1881, 1887, 1893, 1900, and 1905. 

As a judge on this court, Gary presided over the Haymarket Riot case in 1886, sentencing anarchists August Spies, Michael Schwab, Samuel Fielden, Albert Parsons, Adolph Fischer, George Engel, and Louis Lingg to death, and sentencing Oscar Neebe to 15 years. There was no evidence that any of the defendants had any connection with the bombing. Gary allowed them to be convicted on the theory that their speeches had encouraged the unknown bomber to commit the act. During the trial, anarchist sympathizers frequently made death threats against him, raising his general popularity.

In 1888, Gary was appointed as one of the three judges of the Illinois Appellate Court in the first district—Cook County—by the members of the Illinois Supreme Court. He served eight years assigned to the Appellate Court before being dismissed by the Illinois Supreme Court in June 1897, along with nearly every other appellate judge in the state.

Gary had continued to hold his judgeship on the Cook County Superior Court while serving on the appellate court. After his dismissal from the appellate court, Gary continued serving on the county superior court. Later that year, he presided over the sensational murder trial of Adolph Luetgert. 

Gary was still active as a judge at the time of his death, and was the oldest judge on his court and one of the oldest judges in the country at the time. He held court on the morning before his death. He became ill the morning of his death, and soon died at home just after noon. On April 1907, a special election was held to fill the remaining four years of his term. Republican William H. McSurely narrowly defeated Democrat William Emmett Dever.

==Personal life==
Joseph Gary was the eldest of five children born to Eli Bush Gary and his wife Frances O. (&quot;&quot; Easton). Eli Gary was a carpenter and joiner who served as a volunteer in the War of 1812. Joseph Gary&#x27;s younger brother, George Gary, was a notable politician and judge in Wisconsin.

In 1855, Joseph Gary married Elizabeth Jane Swelting, at Berlin, Wisconsin.

<text>Aristoxenus of Tarentum (; born 375, fl. 335 BC) was a Greek Peripatetic philosopher, and a pupil of Aristotle. Most of his writings, which dealt with philosophy, ethics and music, have been lost, but one musical treatise, &quot;Elements of Harmony&quot; (Greek: ; Latin: &quot;Elementa harmonica&quot;), survives incomplete, as well as some fragments concerning rhythm and meter. The &quot;Elements&quot; is the chief source of our knowledge of ancient Greek music.

==Life==
Aristoxenus was born at Tarentum (in modern-day Apulia, southern Italy) in Magna Graecia, and was the son of a learned musician named Spintharus (otherwise Mnesias). He learned music from his father, and having then been instructed by Lamprus of Erythrae and Xenophilus the Pythagorean, he finally became a pupil of Aristotle, whom he appears to have rivaled in the variety of his studies.

According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, he heaped insults on Aristotle after his death, because Aristotle had designated Theophrastus as the next head of the Peripatetic school, a position which Aristoxenus himself had coveted, having achieved great distinction as a pupil of Aristotle. This story is, however, contradicted by Aristocles, who asserts that he only ever mentioned Aristotle with the greatest respect. Nothing is known of his life after the time of Aristotle&#x27;s departure, apart from a comment in &quot;Elementa Harmonica&quot; concerning his works.

==Overview of his works==
His writings were said to have consisted of four hundred and fifty-three books, and dealt with philosophy, ethics and music. 
Although his final years were in the Peripatetic school, and he hoped to succeed Aristotle on his death, Aristoxenus was strongly influenced by Pythagoreanism, and was only a follower of Aristotle in so far as Aristotle was a follower of Plato and Pythagoras. Thus, as Gibson tells us: &quot;the various philosophical influences&quot;
on Aristoxenus included growing up in the profoundly Pythagorean city of Taras (Tarentum), home also of the two Pythagoreans Archytas and Philolaus, and his father&#x27;s (Pythagorean) musical background, which he inculcated into his son. Gibson tells us that, after the influence of his father:

However, Aristoxenus disagreed with earlier Pythagorean musical theory in several respects, building on their work with ideas of his own. The only work of his that has come down to us is the three books of the &quot;Elements of Harmony&quot;, an incomplete musical treatise. Aristoxenus&#x27; theory had an empirical tendency; in music he held that the notes of the scale are to be judged, not as earlier Pythagoreans had believed, by mathematical ratio, but by the ear. Vitruvius in his &quot;De architectura&quot; paraphrases the writings of Aristoxenus on music. His ideas were responded to and developed by some later theorists such as Archestratus, and his place in the methodological debate between rationalists and empiricists was commented upon by such writers as Ptolemais of Cyrene.

The Pythagorean theory that the soul is a &#x27;harmony&#x27; of the four elements composing the body, and therefore mortal (&quot;nothing at all,&quot; in the words of Cicero), was ascribed to Aristoxenus (fr. 118–121 Wehrli) and Dicaearchus. This theory is comparable to the one offered by Simmias in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;.

==&quot;Elementa harmonica&quot;==
In his &quot;Elements of Harmony&quot; (also &quot;Harmonics&quot;), Aristoxenus attempted a complete and systematic exposition of music. The first book contains an explanation of the genera of Greek music, and also of their species; this is followed by some general definitions of terms, particularly those of sound, interval, and system. In the second book Aristoxenus divides music into seven parts, which he takes to be: the genera, intervals, sounds, systems, tones or modes, mutations, and &quot;melopoeia&quot;. The remainder of the work is taken up with a discussion of the many parts of music according to the order which he had himself prescribed.

While it is often held among modern scholars that Aristoxenus rejected the opinion of the Pythagoreans that arithmetic rules were the ultimate judge of intervals and that in every system there must be found a mathematical coincidence before such a system can be said to be harmonic, Aristoxenus made extensive use of arithmetic terminology, notably to define varieties of semitones and dieses in his descriptions of the various genera.

In his second book he asserted that &quot;by the hearing we judge of the magnitude of an interval, and by the understanding we consider its many powers.&quot; And further he wrote, &quot;that the nature of melody is best discovered by the perception of sense, and is retained by memory; and that there is no other way of arriving at the knowledge of music;&quot; and though, he wrote, &quot;others affirm that it is by the study of instruments that we attain this knowledge;&quot; this, he wrote, is talking wildly, &quot;for just as it is not necessary for him who writes an Iambic to attend to the arithmetical proportions of the feet of which it is composed, so it is not necessary for him who writes a Phrygian song to attend to the ratios of the sounds proper thereto.&quot; However, this should not be construed as meaning that he postulated a simplistic system of harmony resembling that of modern twelve tone theory, and especially not an equally tempered system. As he urges us to consider, &quot;(a)fter all, with which of the people who argue about the shades of the genera should one agree? Not everyone looks to the same division when tuning the chromatic or the enharmonic, so why should the note a ditone from mesé be called lichanos rather than a small amount higher?&quot;

It is sometimes claimed that the nature of Aristoxenus&#x27; scales and genera deviated sharply from his predecessors. That Aristoxenus used a model for creating scales based upon the notion of a topos, or range of pitch location, is fact, but there is no reason to believe that he alone set this precedent as he himself does not make this claim. Indeed, the idea of unfixed pitch locations that cover certain ranges, the limits of which may be defined by fixed points, is a notion that was popular until the modern fixation upon fixed pitch systems, as is indicated by Baroque theoretical systems of pitch and intonation. Another way of stating this, however perhaps less accurate, is that instead of using discrete ratios to place intervals, he used continuously variable quantities.

The postulation that this resulted in the structuring of his tetrachords and the resulting scales having &#x27;other&#x27; qualities of consonance is one that can only be accounted for by the recourse to often repeated inconsistencies amongst his interpreters and modern confirmation bias in favour of simplified twelve tone theories. Aristoxenus himself held that &quot;... two things must not be overlooked: First, that many people have mistakenly supposed us to be saying that a tone can be divided into three equal parts in a melody. They made this mistake because they did not realise that it is one thing to employ the third part of a tone, and another to divide a tone into three parts and sing all three. Secondly we accept that from a purely abstract point of view there is no least interval.&quot;

In book three Aristoxenus goes on to describe twenty eight laws of melodic succession, which are of great interest to those concerned with classical Greek melodic structure.

==On rhythmics and metrics==

Part of the second book of a work on rhythmics and metrics, &quot;Elementa rhythmica&quot;, is preserved in medieval manuscript tradition.

Aristoxenus was also the author of a work &quot;On the Primary Duration&quot; (&quot;chronos&quot;).

A five-column fragment of a treatise on meter (P. Oxy. 9) was published in Grenfell and Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Oxyrhynchus Papyri&quot;, vol. 1 (1898) and is probably by Aristoxenus.

<doc id="98923" wikidata="Q27702" url="?curid=98923" title="October Crisis">
<text>The October Crisis () was a chain of political events in Canada that started in October 1970 when members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped the provincial Labour Minister Pierre Laporte and British diplomat James Cross from his Montreal residence. These events saw Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoking the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; for the first time in Canadian history during peacetime.

The premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa, and the mayor of Montreal, Jean Drapeau, supported Trudeau&#x27;s invocation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, which limited civil liberties and granted the police far-reaching powers, allowing them to arrest and detain 497 people. The Government of Quebec also requested military aid to support the civil authorities, with Canadian Forces being deployed throughout Quebec.

Although negotiations led to Cross&#x27;s release, Laporte was murdered by the kidnappers. The crisis affected the province of Quebec, especially the metropolitan area of Montreal, and ended on December 28.

At the time opinion polls in Quebec and throughout Canada showed widespread support for the usage of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;. The response was criticized by prominent politicians such as René Lévesque and Tommy Douglas.

After the crisis, movements that pushed for electoral votes as a means to attain autonomy and independence grew stronger. At the time, support also grew for the sovereignist political party known as the Parti Québécois, which formed the provincial government in 1976.

==Background==
From 1963 to 1970, the Quebec nationalist group Front de libération du Québec detonated over 200 bombs. While mailboxes, particularly in the affluent and predominantly Anglophone city of Westmount, were common targets, the largest single bombing occurred at the Montreal Stock Exchange on February 13, 1969, which caused extensive damage and injured 27 people. Other targets included Montreal City Hall, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the T. Eaton Company department store, armed forces recruiting offices, railway tracks, statues, and army installations. In a strategic move, FLQ members stole several tons of dynamite from military and industrial sites. Financed by bank robberies, they also threatened, via their official communication organ &quot;La Cognée&quot;, that more attacks were to come.

On July 24, 1967, the nationalist cause received support from French President Charles de Gaulle who, standing on a balcony in Montreal, shouted &quot;&quot;. De Gaulle was promptly rebuked by Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson. In a statement delivered to the French embassy Pearson declared, &quot;The people of Canada are free. Every province in Canada is free. Canadians do not need to be liberated. Indeed, many thousands of Canadians gave their lives in two world wars in the liberation of France and other European countries.&quot;

By 1970, 23 members of the FLQ were in prison, including four convicted of murder. On February 26, 1970, two men in a panel truck, including Jacques Lanctôt, were arrested in Montreal when they were found with a sawed-off shotgun and a communiqué announcing the kidnapping of the Israeli consul. In June, police raided a home in the small community of Prévost, located north of Montreal in the Laurentian Mountains, and found firearms, ammunition, of dynamite, detonators, and the draft of a ransom note to be used in the kidnapping of the United States consul.

==Timeline==

* October 5: Montreal, Quebec: Two members of the &quot;Liberation Cell&quot; of the FLQ kidnap British diplomat James Cross from his home. The kidnappers are disguised as delivery men bringing a package for his recent birthday. Once the maid lets them in, they pull out a rifle and a revolver and kidnap Cross. This is followed by a communiqué to the authorities containing the kidnappers&#x27; demands, which included the exchange of Cross for &quot;political prisoners&quot;, a number of convicted or detained FLQ members, and the CBC broadcast of the FLQ Manifesto. The terms of the ransom note are the same as those found in June for the planned kidnapping of the U.S. consul. At this time, the police do not connect the two.
* October 8: Broadcast of the FLQ Manifesto in all French- and English-speaking media outlets in Quebec.
* October 10: Montreal, Quebec: Members of the Chénier Cell of the FLQ approach the home of the Quebec Minister of Labour, Pierre Laporte, while he is playing football with his nephew on his front lawn. These members kidnap Laporte.
* October 11: The CBC broadcasts a letter from captivity from Pierre Laporte to the Premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa.
* October 12: General Gilles Turcot sends troops from the Canadian Forces to guard federal property in the Ottawa region, by request of the federal government. Lawyer Robert Lemieux is appointed by the FLQ to negotiate the release of James Cross and Pierre Laporte. The Quebec government appoints Robert Demers.
* October 13: Prime Minister Trudeau is interviewed by the CBC with respect to the military presence. In a combative interview Trudeau asks the reporter, Tim Ralfe, what he would do in his place. When Ralfe asks Trudeau how far he would go, Trudeau replies, &quot;Just watch me&quot;.
* October 14: Sixteen prominent Quebec personalities, including René Lévesque and Claude Ryan, call for negotiating &quot;exchange of the two hostages for the political prisoners&quot;. FLQ&#x27;s lawyer Robert Lemieux urges Université de Montréal (University of Montreal) students to boycott classes in support of FLQ.
* October 15: Quebec City: The negotiations between the lawyers Lemieux and Demers are put to an end. The Government of Quebec formally requests the intervention of the Canadian army in &quot;aid of the civil power&quot; pursuant to the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;. All three opposition parties, including the Parti Québécois, rise in the National Assembly and agree with the decision. On the same day separatist groups are permitted to speak at the Université de Montréal. Robert Lemieux organizes 3,000 students in a rally in Paul Sauvé Arena to show support for the FLQ; labour leader Michel Chartrand announces that popular support for FLQ is rising and states &quot;We are going to win because there are more boys ready to shoot members of Parliament than there are policemen.&quot; The rally frightens many Canadians, who view it as a possible prelude to outright insurrection in Quebec.
* October 16: Premier Bourassa formally requests that the government of Canada grant the government of Quebec &quot;emergency powers&quot; that allow them to &quot;apprehend and keep in custody&quot; individuals. This results in the implementation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, allowing the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, giving wide-reaching powers of arrest to police. The City of Montreal had already made such a request on the previous day. These measures came into effect at 4:00 a.m. Prime Minister Trudeau makes a broadcast announcing the imposition of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;.
* October 17: Montreal, Quebec: The Chénier cell of the FLQ announces that hostage Pierre Laporte has been executed. He was strangled and then stuffed in the trunk of a car and abandoned in the bush near Saint-Hubert Airport, a few miles from Montreal. A communique to police advising that Pierre Laporte has been executed refers to him derisively as the &quot;minister of unemployment and assimilation&quot;. In another communique issued by the &quot;Liberation cell&quot; holding James Cross, his kidnappers declare that they are suspending indefinitely the death sentence against him, that they will not release him until their demands are met, and that he will be executed if the &quot;fascist police&quot; discover them and attempt to intervene. The demands they make are: Controversially, police reports (which were not released to the public until 2010) state that Pierre Laporte was accidentally killed during a struggle. The FLQ subsequently wanted to use his death to its advantage by convincing the government that they should be taken seriously.
* October 18: While denouncing the acts of &quot;subversion and terrorism – both of which are so tragically contrary to the best interests of our people&quot;, columnist, politician, and future Premier of Quebec René Lévesque criticizes the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;: &quot;Until we receive proof (of the size the revolutionary army) to the contrary, we will believe that such a minute, numerically unimportant fraction is involved, that rushing into the enactment of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; was a panicky and altogether excessive reaction, especially when you think of the inordinate length of time they want to maintain this regime.&quot;
* November 6: Police raid the hiding place of the FLQ&#x27;s Chénier cell. Although three members escape the raid, Bernard Lortie is arrested and charged with the kidnapping and murder of Pierre Laporte.
* December 3: Montreal, Quebec: After being held hostage for 62 days, kidnapped British Trade Commissioner James Cross is released by the FLQ Liberation Cell after negotiations between lawyers Bernard Mergler and Robert Demers. Simultaneously, the five known kidnappers, Marc Carbonneau, Yves Langlois, Jacques Lanctôt, Jacques Cossette-Trudel and his wife, Louise Lanctôt, are granted safe passage to Cuba by the government of Canada after approval by Fidel Castro. They are flown to Cuba by a Canadian Forces aircraft. Jacques Lanctôt is the same man who, earlier that year, had been arrested and then released on bail for the attempted kidnapping of the Israeli consul.
* December 23: Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announces that all troops stationed in Quebec will be withdrawn by January 5, 1971.
* December 28: Saint-Luc, Quebec: The three members of the Chénier Cell still at large, Paul Rose, Jacques Rose, and Francis Simard, are arrested after being found hiding in a 6m tunnel in a rural farming community. They would later be charged with the kidnapping and murder of Pierre Laporte.

==War Measures Act and military involvement==
When Trudeau was asked by CBC reporter Tim Ralfe how far he was willing to go to stop the FLQ, he replied: &quot;Just watch me.&quot; Three days later, on October 16, the Cabinet, under Trudeau&#x27;s chairmanship, advised the governor general to invoke the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; at the request of the Premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa; and the Mayor of Montreal, Jean Drapeau. The &quot;War Measures Act&quot; gave sweeping powers of arrest and internment to the police. The provisions took effect at 4 a.m. and, shortly after that, hundreds of suspected FLQ members and sympathizers were rounded-up. In total, 497 people were arrested, including union activist Michel Chartrand, singer Pauline Julien and her partner, future Quebec Minister Gérald Godin, poet Gaston Miron, Dr. Henri Bellemare, simple living advocate Serge Mongeau, and CBC journalist Nick Auf der Maur and a junior producer.

This act was imposed after the negotiations with the FLQ had broken down, and the premier of Quebec was facing the next stage in the FLQ&#x27;s agenda.

At the time, opinion polls in Quebec and the rest of Canada showed overwhelming support for the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;; in a December 1970 Gallup Poll, it was noted that 89% of English-speaking Canadians and 86% of French-speaking Canadians supported the introduction of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;. They respectively showed 6% and 9% disapproval while the remaining 5% of each population was undecided. Since then, the government&#x27;s use of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; in peacetime has been a subject of debate in Canada as it gave police sweeping powers of arrest and detention.

Simultaneously, under provisions quite separate from the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; and much more commonly used, the solicitor-general of Quebec requisitioned the military&#x27;s deployment from the chief of the Defence Staff in accordance with the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;. Troops from Quebec bases and elsewhere in the country were dispatched, under the direction of the (Quebec&#x27;s provincial police force), to guard vulnerable points and prominent individuals at risk. This freed up police resources to pursue more proactive tasks in dealing with the crisis.

The two named Canadian Forces operations were Operation Ginger (to mount guards on the Government of Canada buildings and significant residences outside of Quebec) and Operation Essay (to provide aid to Quebec&#x27;s civil power). The , more commonly known as the &quot;Van Doos&quot;, the most famous French-Canadian regiment in the Canadian Army, was deployed to Montreal to guard buildings. It was understood that deploying troops from English-speaking regiments in Quebec as an aid to civil power would be politically problematic. Throughout the operation, the Army made a point of deploying primarily French-Canadian soldiers to guard buildings in Quebec. The was based in Quebec City, but it was felt that having the &quot;Van Doos&quot; perform guard duty in Montreal, the largest city in Quebec, would be less likely to offend public opinion. The Canadian Army saw no action during its deployment, which lasted until November 12. Only one soldier was killed when he tripped over his loaded rifle while on guard duty and inadvertently shot and killed himself.

Outside Quebec, mainly in the Ottawa area, the federal government deployed troops under its own authority to guard federal offices and employees. The combination of the increased powers of arrest granted by the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, and the military deployment requisitioned and controlled by Quebec&#x27;s government gave every appearance that martial law had been imposed. However, a significant difference was that the military remained in a support role to the civil authorities (in this case, Quebec authorities) and never had a judicial role. It still allowed for the criticism of the government, and the was able to go about its everyday business free of any restrictions, including the criticism of the government and the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;.

Nevertheless, many Canadians found the sight of tanks outside the federal parliament disconcerting. Moreover, police officials sometimes abused their powers without just cause, and some prominent artists and intellectuals associated with the sovereignty movement were detained.

The October Crisis was the only occasion in which the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; was invoked in peacetime. The FLQ was declared an unlawful association, which meant that, under the &quot;War Measures Act,&quot; the police had full power to arrest, interrogate, and hold anyone whom they believed was associated with the FLQ: &quot;A person who was a member to this group, acted or supported it in some fashion became liable to a jail term not to exceed five years. A person arrested for such a purpose could be held without bail for up to ninety days.&quot; It is estimated that within the first 24 hours of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; being put in place, police had mobilized to arrest suspects of the unlawful organization. The police conducted 3000 searches, and 497 people were detained. 
The &quot;War Measures Act&quot; also violated and limited many human rights of people being incarcerated: &quot;Everyone arrested under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; was denied due process. Habeas corpus (an individual&#x27;s right to have a judge confirm that they have been lawfully detained) was suspended. The Crown could detain a suspect for seven days before charging them with a crime. In addition, the attorney general could order, before the seven days expired, that the accused be held for up to 21 days. The prisoners were not permitted to consult legal counsel, and many were held incommunicado.&quot;
Several of those detained were upset by the method of their interrogation. However, most of those interviewed after had little cause to complain, and several even commented on the courteous nature of the interrogations and searches. In addition, the Quebec Ombudsman, Louis Marceau, was instructed to hear complaints of detainees, and the Quebec government agreed to pay damages to any person unjustly arrested. On February 3, 1971, John Turner, Minister of Justice of Canada, reported that 497 persons had been arrested under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, 435 of whom had already been released. The other 62 were charged, of whom 32 were accused of crimes of such seriousness that a Quebec Superior Court judge refused them bail. Regarding Trudeau&#x27;s invocation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, the Canadian historian Desmond Morton wrote: &quot;It was unprecedented. On the basis of facts then and revealed later, it was unjustified. It was also a brilliant success. Shock was the best safeguard against bloodshed. Trudeau&#x27;s target was not two frightened little bands of terrorists, one of which soon strangled its helpless victim: it was the affluent dilettantes of revolutionary violence, cheering on the anonymous heroes of the FLQ. The proclamation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; and the thousands of grim troops pouring into Montreal froze the cheers, dispersed the coffee-table revolutionaries, and left them frightened and isolated while the police rounded up suspects whose offence, if any, was dreaming of blood in the streets&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Pierre Laporte was eventually found killed by his captors, while James Cross was freed after 59 days as a result of negotiations with the kidnappers who requested exile to Cuba rather than facing trial in Quebec. The cell members responsible for Laporte&#x27;s death were arrested and charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder after they returned.

The response by the federal and provincial governments to the incident still sparks controversy. This is the only time that the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; had been put in place during peacetime in Canada. A few critics (most notably Tommy Douglas and some members of the New Democratic Party) believed that Trudeau was excessive in advising the use of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; to suspend civil liberties and that the precedent set by this incident was dangerous. Federal Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield initially supported Trudeau&#x27;s actions but later regretted doing so.

In 1972, Michael Forrestall, the defence critic in the Conservative shadow cabinet, warned when Trudeau stated he would use the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; again, &quot;the deliberate use of the military to enforce the will of one group of Canadians over the will of another group of Canadians is detrimental to the credibility of the armed forces.&quot; The size of the FLQ organization and the number of sympathizers in the public was not known. However, in its Manifesto the FLQ stated: &quot;In the coming year (Quebec Premier Robert) Bourassa will have to face reality; 100,000 revolutionary workers, armed and organized.&quot; Given this declaration, seven years of bombings, and communiques throughout that time that strove to present an image of a powerful organization spread secretly throughout all sectors of society, the authorities took significant action.

The events of October 1970 marked a significant loss of support for the violent wing of the Quebec sovereigntist movement. This came after it had gained support over nearly ten years and increased support for political means of attaining independence, including support for the sovereigntist Parti Québécois, which went on to take power at the provincial level in 1976. In 1987, after the defeat of the Meech Lake Accord, which sought to amend the Constitution of Canada to resolve the passage by a previous government of the &quot;Constitution Act 1982&quot; without Quebec&#x27;s ratification, a pro-independence political party, the Bloc Québécois, was also created at the federal level.

The deployment of the military as an aid to civil power was very unpopular with the senior leadership of the Canadian Forces. In the 1950s the primary purpose of the Canadian Army was to fight against the Red Army in Central Europe if World War Three broke out. During the Pearson years and even more so under Trudeau there was a tendency on the part of the government to cut military spending and to shift the role of the Canadian Forces to acting more as an internal security force. In 1968–69, Trudeau had seriously considered pulling out of NATO and stayed only to avoid damaging relations with the United States and Western Europe.

On April 3, 1969, Trudeau announced that Canada would stay in NATO after all, but he drastically cut military spending and pulled out half of the 10,000 Canadian soldiers and airmen stationed in West Germany. In the same speech Trudeau stated that safeguarding Canada against external and internal threats would be the number-one mission of the Canadian Forces, guarding North America in co-operation with the United States would be the number-two mission, and NATO commitments would be the number-three mission. In early 1970 the government introduced a white paper &quot;Defence in the Seventies&quot;, which stated the &quot;Priority One&quot; of the Canadian Forces would be upholding internal security rather than preparing for World War III, which of course meant a sharp cut in military spending since the future enemy was now envisioned to be the FLQ rather than the Red Army.

The October Crisis, much to the dismay of the generals, was used by Trudeau as an argument for transforming the Canadian Forces into a force whose &quot;Priority One&quot; was internal security. Many officers knew very well that the &quot;Priority One&quot; of internal security was &quot;a greater threat than any other potential role.&quot; By the end of the 1970s, the Canadian Forces had been transformed by Trudeau into an internal security force that was not capable of fighting a major conventional war.

By 1982 all the convicted participants had been paroled and all of those sent to Cuba had returned to Canada, some completing short sentences in Canada.

In 1988, the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; and the &quot;Emergency Preparedness Act&quot; (which in turn was replaced by the &quot;Emergency Management Act&quot; in 2007).

In October 2020, 50 years following the October Crisis, Yves-François Blanchet, the party and parliamentary leader of the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois, introduced a motion in the House of Commons demanding an official apology from the federal government, now led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, son of Pierre Trudeau, for invoking the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;.

<doc id="98924" wikidata="Q582093" url="?curid=98924" title="Antiphon">
<text>An antiphon (Greek ἀντίφωνον, ἀντί &quot;opposite&quot; and φωνή &quot;voice&quot;) is a short chant in Christian ritual, sung as a refrain. The texts of antiphons are usually taken from the Psalms or Scripture, but may also be freely composed. Their form was favored by St Ambrose and they feature prominently in Ambrosian chant, but they are used widely in Gregorian chant as well. They may be used during Mass, for the Introit, the Offertory or the Communion. They may also be used in the Liturgy of the Hours, typically for Lauds or Vespers.

They should not be confused with Marian antiphons or processional antiphons.

When a chant consists of alternating verses (usually sung by a cantor) and responses (usually sung by the congregation), a refrain is needed.

The looser term antiphony is generally used for any call and response style of singing, such as the kirtan or the sea shanty and other work songs, and songs and worship in African and African-American culture. Antiphonal music is that performed by two choirs in interaction, often singing alternate musical phrases. &quot;Antiphonal psalmody&quot; is the singing or musical playing of psalms by alternating groups of performers. The term &quot;antiphony&quot; can also refer to a choir-book containing antiphons.

== Origins ==

The chant of early Christianity through to the end of the 5th century had its root in the Synagogue, whence early Christians borrowed the traditions of the chanting of psalms, singing of hymns and cantillation. There is some evidence from Acts of the Apostles that early Christians stayed close to contemporary Jewish traditions. For example, Acts 2:46–47 states that &quot;with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people&quot;. Socrates of Constantinople wrote that antiphony was introduced into Christian worship by Ignatius of Antioch (died 107) after he saw a vision of two choirs of angels. Antiphonal singing was an element of Jewish liturgy believed to have entered the monasteries of Syria and Palestine in the 4th century from the Jewish communities such as the one in Antioch.

Antiphons have remained an integral part of the worship in the Byzantine and Armenian Rite. The practice did not become part of the Latin Church until more than two centuries later. Ambrose and Gregory the Great, who are known for their contributions to the formulation of Gregorian chant, are credited with &#x27;antiphonaries&#x27;, collections of works suitable for antiphon, which are still used in the Catholic Church today.

== Polyphonic votive antiphons ==

Polyphonic Marian antiphons emerged in England in the 14th century as settings of texts honouring the Virgin Mary, which were sung separately from the mass and office, often after Compline. Towards the end of the 15th century, English composers produced expanded settings up to nine parts, with increasing complexity and vocal range. The largest collection of such antiphons is the late-15th-century &quot;Eton Choirbook&quot;. As a result, antiphony remains particularly common in the Anglican musical tradition: the singers often face each other, placed in the quire&#x27;s &quot;Decani&quot; and &quot;Cantoris&quot;.

== Greater Advent antiphons ==

The Greater Advent or O Antiphons are antiphons used at daily prayer in the evenings of the last days of Advent in various liturgical Christian traditions. Each antiphon is a name of Christ, one of his attributes mentioned in Scripture. In the Roman Catholic tradition, they are sung as antiphons to the Magnificat in Vespers from December 17 to December 23. In the Church of England they have traditionally been used as antiphons to the Magnificat at Evening Prayer. More recently they have found a place in primary liturgical documents throughout the Anglican Communion, including the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Common Worship&quot; liturgy. Use of the O Antiphons was preserved in Lutheranism at the German Reformation, and they continue to be sung in Lutheran churches.

== Polychoral antiphony ==

When two or more groups of singers sing in alternation, the style of music can also be called &quot;polychoral&quot;. Specifically, this term is usually applied to music of the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. Polychoral techniques are a definitive characteristic of the music of the Venetian school, exemplified by the works of Giovanni Gabrieli: this music is often known as the Venetian polychoral style. The Venetian polychoral style was an important innovation of the late Renaissance. This style, with its variations as it spread across Europe after 1600, helped to define the beginning of the Baroque era. Polychoral music was not limited to Italy in the Renaissance; it was also popular in France with Marc-Antoine Charpentier (37 settings H.16–H.52), in Spain and Germany. There are examples from the 19th and 20th centuries, from composers as diverse as Hector Berlioz, Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

<doc id="98927" wikidata="Q139083" url="?curid=98927" title="Theramenes">
<text>Theramenes (; ; died 404/403 BC) was an Athenian military leader and statesman, prominent in the final decade of the Peloponnesian War. He was active during the two periods of oligarchic government at Athens, the 400 and later the Thirty Tyrants, as well as in the trial of the generals who had commanded at Arginusae in 406 BC. A moderate oligarch, he often found himself caught between the democrats on the one hand and the extremist oligarchs on the other. Successful in replacing a narrow oligarchy with a broader one in 411 BC, he failed to achieve the same end in 404 BC, and was executed by the extremists whose policies he had opposed.

==Historical record==

No ancient biographies of Theramenes are known, but his life and actions are relatively well documented, due to the extensive treatment given him in several surviving works. The Attic orator Lysias deals with him at length in several of his speeches, albeit in a very hostile manner. Theramenes also appears in several ancient narrative histories: Thucydides&#x27; account includes the beginnings of Theramenes&#x27; career, and Xenophon, picking up where Thucydides left off, gives a detailed account of several episodes from Theramenes career including a sympathetic and vivid description of his last actions and words; Diodorus Siculus, probably drawing his account from Ephorus at most points, provides another account that varies widely from Xenophon&#x27;s at several points. Theramenes also appears in several other sources, which, although they do not provide as many narrative details, have been used to illuminate the political disputes which surrounded Theramenes&#x27; life and memory.

==Family==
Only the barest outlines of Theramenes&#x27; life outside the public sphere have been preserved in the historical record. His father, Hagnon had played a significant role in Athenian public life in the decades before Theramenes&#x27; appearance on the scene. He had commanded the group of Greek colonists who founded Amphipolis in 437–6 BC, had served as a general on several occasions before and during the Peloponnesian War, and was one of the signers of the Peace of Nicias. Hagnon&#x27;s career overlapped with his son&#x27;s when he served as one of the ten commissioners appointed by the government of the 400 to draft a new constitution in 411 BC.

==Coup of 411 BC==
===Overthrow of the democracy===
Theramenes&#x27; first appearance in the historical record comes with his involvement in the oligarchic coup of 411 BC. In the wake of the Athenian defeat in Sicily, revolts began to break out among Athens&#x27; subject states in the Aegean Sea and the Peace of Nicias fell apart; the Peloponnesian War resumed in full by 412 BC. In this context, a number of Athenian aristocrats, led by Peisander and with Theramenes prominent among their ranks, began to conspire to overthrow the city&#x27;s democratic government. This intrigue was initiated by the exiled nobleman Alcibiades, who was at that time acting as an assistant to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes. Claiming that he had great influence with Tissaphernes, Alcibiades promised to return to Athens, bringing Persian support with him, if the democracy that had exiled him were replaced with an oligarchy. Accordingly, a number of trierarchs and other leaders of the Athenian army at Samos began planning the overthrow of the democracy. They eventually dispatched Peisander to Athens, where, by promising that the return of Alcibiades and an alliance with Persia would follow if the Athenians would replace their democracy with an oligarchy, he persuaded the Athenian &quot;ecclesia&quot; to send him as an emissary to Alcibiades, authorized to make whatever arrangements were necessary.

Alcibiades, however, did not succeed in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be speaking for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city&#x27;s democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.

After making arrangements to their satisfaction at Samos the leaders of the conspiracy set sail for Athens. Among them was Theramenes; Thucydides refers to him as &quot;one of the leaders of the party that put down the democracy—an able speaker and a man with ideas.&quot; Calling the assembly together, the conspirators proposed a series of measures by which the democracy was formally replaced with a government of 400 chosen men, who were to select and convene a larger body of 5,000 as time went on. Shortly afterwards, the conspirators went, under arms, to the council chamber, where they ordered the democratic council to disperse after collecting their pay; the council did as ordered, and from this point forward the mechanism of government was fully under the control of the oligarchic conspirators; they quickly changed the laws to reflect the new form of government they had imposed.
===Conflict within the movement===
At this point, several conflicts began to develop that threatened the future of the new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias as the leader of the moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynichus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens&#x27; power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.

Shortly after taking power, the extremist leaders of the revolution had begun constructing fortifications on Eëtioneia, a dominant point in the entrance to the harbor of Piraeus, ostensibly to protect the harbor against an attack from the fleet at Samos. With internal dissent increasing, they joined these new fortifications to existing walls to form a redoubt defensible against attacks from land or sea, which contained a large warehouse into which the extremists moved most of the city&#x27;s grain supply. Theramenes protested strongly against the building of this fortification, arguing that its purpose was not to keep the democrats out, but to be handed over to the Spartans; Thucydides testifies that his charges were not without substance, as the extremists were actually contemplating such an action. Initially cautious (as enemies of the regime had been executed before), Theramenes and his party were emboldened and galvanized into action by several events. First, a Peloponnesian fleet, ostensibly dispatched to assist anti-Athenian forces on Euboea, was moving slowly up the coast of the Peloponnese; Theramenes charged that this fleet was planning to seize the fortifications on Eetioneia, in collaboration with the extremists. Second, an Athenian militiaman, apparently acting on orders from conspirators higher in the ranks of the government, assassinated Phrynichus, the leader of the extremist faction. He escaped, but his accomplice, an Argive, was captured; the prisoner, under torture, refused to state the name of his employer. With the extremists unable to take effective action in this case, and with the Peloponnesian fleet overrunning Aegina (a logical stopping point on the approach to Piraeus), Theramenes and his party decided to act.

Aristocrates, who was commanding a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, arrested the extremist general Alexicles; enraged, the extremist leaders of the 400 demanded action, and made a number of threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that if they wanted to pull it down, he thought that would be good. Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes&#x27; party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus, but, finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.

==In command==
Under the government of the 5,000 and under the democracy that replaced it in 410 BC, Theramenes served as a general for several years, commanding fleets in the Aegean Sea and the Hellespont. Shortly after the rise of the government of the 5,000, Theramenes set sail to the Hellespont to join Thrasybulus and the generals elected by the army at Samos. After the Athenian victory at Abydos, he took thirty triremes to attack the rebels on Euboea, who were building a causeway to Boeotia to provide land access to their island. Unable to stop the construction, he plundered the territory of several rebellious cities, then travelled around the Aegean suppressing oligarchies and raising funds from various cities of the Athenian Empire. He then took his fleet to Macedon, where he assisted the Macedonian king Archelaus in his siege of Pydna, but, with that siege dragging on, he sailed on to join Thrasybulus in Thrace. The fleet soon moved on from there to challenge Mindarus&#x27; fleet, which had seized the city of Cyzicus. Theramenes commanded one wing of the Athenian fleet in the resulting Battle of Cyzicus, a decisive Athenian victory. In that battle, Alcibiades (who had been recalled from exile by the fleet at Samos shortly after the coup) led a decoy force that drew the Spartan fleet out into open water, while Thrasybulus and Theramenes, each commanding an independent squadron, cut off the Spartans&#x27; retreat. Mindarus was forced to flee to a nearby beach, and vicious fighting ensued on land as the Athenians attempted to drag off the Spartan ships. Thrasybulus and Alcibiades kept the Spartans occupied while Theramenes joined up with the nearby Athenian land forces and then hurried to the rescue; his arrival precipitated a total Athenian victory, in which all the Spartan ships were captured. In the wake of this victory, the Athenians captured Cyzicus and constructed a fort at Chrysopolis, from which they extracted a customs duty of one tenth on all ships passing through the Bosporus. Theramenes and another general remained at this fort with a garrison of thirty ships to oversee the collection of the duty. At Athens, meanwhile, the government of the 5,000 was replaced by a restored democracy within a few months of this battle; Donald Kagan has suggested that the absence of Theramenes, &quot;the best spokesman for the moderates&quot;, paved the way for this restoration.

According to Diodorus and Plutarch, Theramenes participated under the command of Alcibiades to the siege of Byzantium (408 BC), winning the battle against the Peloponnesian army that was appointed to defend that city: Alcibiades was in command of the right wing, while Theramenes was in charge of the left one.

==Arginusae==
Theramenes remained a general through 407 BC, but, in that year, when the Athenian defeat at Notium led to the downfall of Alcibiades and his political allies, Theramenes was not reelected. In the next year, however, he did sail as a trierarch in the scratch Athenian relief fleet sent out to relieve Conon, who had been blockaded with 40 triremes at Mytilene by Callicratidas. That relief force won a surprising victory over the more experienced Spartan force in the Battle of Arginusae, but in the wake of that battle Theramenes found himself in the middle of a massive controversy. At the end of the battle, the generals in command of the fleet had conferred to decide on their next steps. Several pressing concerns presented themselves; 50 Peloponnesian ships under Eteonicus remained at Mytilene, blockading Conon, and decisive action by the Athenians could lead to the destruction of that force as well, but, at the same time, ships needed to be dispatched to recover the sailors of the twenty five Athenian triremes sunk or disabled in the battle. Accordingly, all eight generals, with the larger part of the fleet, set out for Mytilene, while a rescue force under Thrasybulus and Theramenes, both of whom were trierarchs in this battle but had served as generals in prior campaigns, remained behind to pick up the survivors and retrieve corpses for burial. At this point, however, a severe storm blew up, and both of these forces were driven back to shore. Eteonicus escaped, and a great number of Athenian sailors—estimates as to the precise figure have ranged from near 1,000 to as many as 5,000—drowned.
Soon after the news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive controversy erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious over the loss of so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.

Diodorus notes that the generals committed a critical error by attempting to shift the blame onto Theramenes. &quot;For,&quot; he states, &quot;although they could have had the help of Theramenes and his associates in the trial, men who both were able orators and had many friends and, most important of all, had been participants in the events relative to the battle, they had them, on the contrary, as adversaries and bitter accusers.&quot; When the trial came, Theramenes&#x27; numerous political allies were among the leaders of the faction seeking the generals&#x27; conviction. A bitter series of debates and legal maneuvers ensued as the assembly fought over what to do with the generals. At first, it appeared that they might be treated leniently, but in the end, public displays of bereavement by the families of the deceased and aggressive prosecution by a politician named Callixenus swung the opinion of the assembly; the six generals were tried as a group and executed. The Athenian public, as the grief and anger prompted by the disaster cooled, came to regret their action, and for thousands of years historians and commentators have pointed to the incident as perhaps the greatest miscarriage of justice the city&#x27;s government ever perpetrated.

==Negotiating a peace==
In 405 BC, the Athenian navy was defeated and destroyed by the Peloponnesian fleet under Lysander at the Battle of Aegospotami in the Hellespont. Without sufficient funds to build another fleet, the Athenians could only wait as Lysander sailed westward across the Aegean towards their city. Blockaded by land and sea, with their food supplies running low, the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Spartan king Agis, whose army was camped outside their walls, offering to join the Spartan alliance if they were allowed to keep their walls and port; Agis, claiming that he had no power to negotiate, sent the ambassadors on to Sparta, but there they were told that, if they really wanted peace, they should bring the Spartans better proposals. The Athenians were initially intransigent, going so far as to imprison a man who suggested that a stretch of the long walls be torn down as the Spartans had insisted, but the reality of their situation soon compelled them to consider compromises. In this situation, Theramenes, in a speech to the assembly, requested that he be sent as an ambassador to Lysander (who was at this time besieging Samos) to determine the Spartans&#x27; intentions towards Athens; he also stated that he had discovered something that might improve the Athenians&#x27; situation, although he declined to share it with the citizenry. His request was granted, and Theramenes sailed to Samos to meet with Lysander; from there, he was sent to Sparta, perhaps stopping at Athens on the way. At Sparta, with representatives of all of Sparta&#x27;s allies present, Theramenes and his colleagues negotiated the terms of the peace that ended the Peloponnesian War; the long walls and the walls of Piraeus were pulled down, the size of the Athenian fleet was sharply limited, and Athenian foreign policy was subordinated to that of Sparta; the treaty also stipulated that the Athenians were to use &quot;the constitution of their ancestors&quot;. Theramenes returned to Athens and presented the results of the negotiations to the assembly; although some still favored holding out, the majority voted to accept the terms; the Peloponnesian War, after 28 years, was at an end.

==Thirty Tyrants==
In the wake of Athens&#x27; surrender, the long walls were torn down and the troops besieging the city returned to their various homes; a Spartan garrison probably remained in Athens to supervise the dismantling of the walls; Lysander sailed off to Samos to complete the siege of that city. Another clause of the treaty that had ended the war had allowed all exiles to return to Athens, and these men, many of them oligarchic agitators who had been cast out by the democracy, were hard at work in the months after the treaty. Five &quot;overseers&quot; were appointed by the members of the oligarchic social clubs to plan the transition to an oligarchy. In July 404 BC, they summoned Lysander back to Athens, where he supervised the change of government; an oligarchic politician, Dracontides, proposed in the council to place the government in the hands of thirty chosen men; Theramenes supported this motion, and, with Lysander threatening to punish the Athenians for failing to dismantle the walls quickly enough unless they assented, it passed the assembly. Thirty men were selected: ten appointed by the &quot;overseers&quot;, ten chosen by Theramenes (including himself), and ten picked by Lysander.

This government, which soon came to be known as the &quot;Thirty Tyrants&quot; for its excesses and atrocities, rapidly set about establishing its control over the city. The oligarchs, led by Critias, one of the &quot;overseers&quot; and a former exile, summoned a Spartan garrison to ensure their safety and then initiated a reign of terror, executing any men who they thought might possess sufficient initiative or a large enough following to effectively challenge them. It was this campaign that first drove a wedge between Theramenes and the leaders of the Thirty; initially a supporter of Critias, Theramenes now argued that it was unnecessary to execute men who had shown no sign of wishing the oligarchy harm just because they had been popular under the democracy. This protest, however, failed to slow the pace of the executions, so Theramenes next argued that, if the oligarchy was to govern by force, it must at least expand its base; fearful that Theramenes might lead a popular movement against them, Critias and the leaders of the Thirty issued a list of 3,000 men who would be associates in the new government. When Theramenes again objected that this number was still too small, the leaders arranged for a military review to be staged after which the citizens were ordered to pile their arms; with the help of the Spartan garrison, the oligarchs then confiscated all arms except those belonging to the 3,000.
This, in turn, marked the beginning of even greater excesses; to pay the Spartan garrison&#x27;s wages, Critias and the leaders ordered each of the Thirty to arrest and execute a metic, or resident alien, and confiscate his property. Theramenes, protesting that this action was worse than the worst excesses of the democracy, refused to follow the order.

Critias and his compatriots, in the light of these events, decided that Theramenes had become an intolerable threat to their rule; accordingly, speaking before the assembly of the 3,000, Critias denounced Theramenes as a born traitor, always ready to shift his political allegiances with the expediencies of the moment. Famously, he branded him with the nickname &quot;cothurnus&quot;, the name of a boot worn on the stage that could fit either foot; Theramenes, he proclaimed, was ready to serve either the democratic or oligarchic cause, seeking only to further his own personal interest. In an impassioned response, Theramenes denied that his politics had ever been inconsistent. He had always, he insisted, favored a moderate policy, neither extreme democracy nor extreme oligarchy, and held true to the ideal of a government composed of men of hoplite status or higher, who would be able to effectively serve the state. This speech had a substantial effect on the audience, and Critias saw that, if the case were brought to a vote, Theramenes would be acquitted. Accordingly, after conferring with the Thirty, Critias ordered men with daggers to line the stage in front of the audience and then struck Theramenes&#x27; name from the roster of the 3,000, denying him his right to a trial. Theramenes, springing to a nearby altar for sanctuary, admonished the assemblage not to permit his murder, but to no avail; the Eleven, keepers of the prison, entered, dragged him away, and forced him to drink a cup of hemlock. Theramenes, imitating a popular drinking game in which the drinker toasted a loved one as he finished his cup, downed the poison and then flung the dregs to the floor, exclaiming &quot;Here&#x27;s to the health of my beloved Critias!&quot;

==Historiography==
Theramenes lived a controversial life, and his death did not end the struggle over how to interpret his actions. In the years after his death, his reputation became an item of contention as former associates of his defended themselves against prosecutors under the restored democracy. (The regime of the Thirty lasted only until 403 BC.) It would appear that, as they defended themselves before democratic-sympathizing Athenian jurymen, Theramenes&#x27; former comrades in the oligarchy attempted to exculpate themselves by associating their actions with those of Theramenes and portraying him as a steadfast defender of the Athenian democracy; examples of such accounts can be found in the &quot;Histories&quot; of Diodorus Siculus and in the &quot;Theramenes papyrus&quot;, a fragmentary work discovered in the 1960s. An example of the sort of attack this portrayal was intended to defend against can be found in two orations of Lysias, &quot;Against Eratosthenes&quot; and &quot;Against Agoratus&quot;; there, Theramenes is portrayed as treasonous and self-interested, doing tremendous harm to the Athenian cause through his machinations. Xenophon adopts a similarly hostile attitude in the early parts of his work, but apparently had a change of heart during the chronological break in composition that divides the second book of the &quot;Hellenica&quot;; his portrayal of Theramenes during the reign of the Thirty Tyrants is altogether more favorable than that of his earlier years. A final portrayal is offered by Aristotle, who, in his &quot;Constitution of the Athenians&quot;, portrays Theramenes as a moderate and a model citizen; historians have disputed the origin of this account, with some treating it as a product of 4th-century BC propaganda by a moderate &quot;Theramenean&quot; party, while others, such as Phillip Harding, see no evidence for such a tradition and argue that Aristotle&#x27;s treatment of Theramenes is entirely a product of his own reassessment of the man. Diodorus Siculus, a historian active in the time of Caesar, presents a generally favorable account of Theramenes, which appears to be drawn from the noted historian Ephorus, who studied in Athens under Isocrates who was taught by Theramenes.

Theramenes&#x27; reputation has undergone a dramatic shift since the 19th century, when Xenophon&#x27;s and Lysias&#x27; unfavorable accounts were widely accepted, and Theramenes was execrated as a turncoat and blamed for instigating the execution of the generals after Arginusae. The discovery of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Constitution of the Athenians&quot; in 1890 reversed this trend for the broad assessment of Theramenes&#x27; character, and Diodorus&#x27; account of the Arginusae trial has been preferred by scholars since Antony Andrewes undermined Xenophon&#x27;s account in the 1970s; Diodorus&#x27; more melodramatic passages, such as his elaborate presentation of Theramenes&#x27; last moments, are still discounted, but he is now preferred on a number of issues, and on the Arginusae trial in particular. Aristophanes, in &quot;The Frogs&quot;, pokes fun at Theramenes&#x27; ability to extricate himself from tight spots, but delivers none of the scathing rebukes one would expect for a politician whose role in the shocking events after Arginusae had been regarded as particularly blameworthy, and modern scholars have seen in this a more accurate depiction of how Theramenes was perceived in his time; Lysias, meanwhile, who mercilessly attacks Theramenes on many counts, has nothing negative to say about the aftermath of Arginusae.

Recent works have generally accepted the image of Theramenes as a moderate, committed to the ideal of a hoplite-based broad oligarchy. Donald Kagan has said of him that &quot;...his entire career reveals him to be a patriot and a true moderate, sincerely committed to a constitution granting power to the hoplite class, whether in the form of a limited democracy or a broadly based oligarchy&quot;, while John Fine has noted that &quot;like many a person following a middle course, he was hated by both political extremes.&quot; The constitution of the 5,000 is recognized as his political masterpiece; his attempt to bring about a similar shift towards moderatism in 404 led directly to his death. That death, meanwhile, has become famous for its drama, and the story of Theramenes&#x27; final moments has been repeated over and over throughout classical historiography. &quot;Because he met his death defying a tyrant,&quot; John Fine notes, &quot;it is easy to idealize Theramenes.&quot; In the millennia since his death, Theramenes has been both idealized and reviled; his brief seven-year career in the spotlight, touching as it did on all the major points of controversy in the last years of the Peloponnesian War, has been subject to myriad different interpretations. From the polemical contemporary works which describe his career have emerged the outlines of a complex figure, charting a dangerous course through the chaos of the late 5th-century Athenian political scene; although historians from ancient times to the present have offered far more specific portraits, of one form or another, it may be that nothing more than that outline will ever be known with certainty.

<text>Odinani, also known as Odinala, Omenala, Odinana, and Omenana (), is the traditional cultural belief and practice of the Igbo people of south east and Igbo people of south south Nigeria. These terms, as used here in the Igbo language, are synonymous with the traditional Igbo &quot;religious system&quot; which was not considered separate from the social norms of ancient or traditional Igbo societies. Theocratic in nature, spirituality played a huge role in their everyday lives. Although it has largely been syncretised with Catholicism, the indigenous belief system remains in strong effect among the rural, village and diaspora populations of the Igbo. Odinani can be found in Haitian Voodoo, Obeah, Santeria and even Candomblé. Odinani is a pantheistic and polytheistic faith, having a strong central deity at its head. All things spring from this deity. Although a pantheon of other gods and spirits, these being Ala, Amadiọha, Anyanwụ, Ekwensu, Ikenga, exists in the belief system, as it does in many other Traditional African religions, the lesser deities prevalent in Odinani serve as helpers or elements of Chukwu, the central deity.

Lesser spirits known as &quot;ágbàrà&quot; or &quot;árúsí&quot; operate below the other gods and higher spirits. These lesser spirits represent natural forces; agbara as a divine force manifests as separate arụsị in the Igbo pantheon. A concept of &#x27;the eye of sun or God&#x27; (&quot;Anyanwu&quot;, ) exists as a masculine and feminine solar deity which forms a part of the solar veneration among the Nri-Igbo in northern Igboland. Arụsị are mediated by &quot;Dibia&quot; and other priests who do not contact the high god directly. Through &quot;áfà&quot;, &#x27;divination&#x27;, the laws and demands of the arụsị are communicated to the living. Arụsị are venerated in community shrines around roadsides and forests while smaller shrines are located in the household for ancestor veneration. Deceased ancestors live in the spirit world where they can be contacted. Below the arụsị are minor and more general spirits known as &quot;mmúọ&quot; loosely defined by their perceived malevolent or benign natures. These minor spirits are not venerated and are sometimes considered the lost souls of the dead. Ancestor worship and the worship of various gods and spirits, form the main component of the traditional Igbo religion, standing in contrast with Abrahamic religions.

The number of people practicing Igbo religion decreased drastically in the 20th century with the influx of Christian missionaries under the auspices of the British colonial government in Nigeria. In some cases, Igbo traditional religion practice known as ọdịnala was syncretised with Christianity, but in many cases indigenous rites were demonised by Christian missionaries who pointed out the practice of human sacrifice and some other cultural practices that were illegal under the colonial government. Earlier missionaries referred to many indigenous religious practices as &quot;juju&quot;. Igbo religion is most present today in harvest ceremonies such as new yam festival (&quot;ị́wá jí&quot;) and masquerading traditions such as mmanwụ and Ekpe.

Remnants of Igbo religious rites spread among African descendants in the Caribbean and North America in era of the Atlantic slave trade. Igbo &quot;ọ́bị̀à&quot; was transferred to the British West Indies and Guyana as obeah and aspects of Igbo masquerading traditions can be found among the festivals of the Garifuna people and jonkonnu in the West Indies and North Carolina.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Ọdịnala&quot; in central Igbo dialect is the compound of the words &quot;ọ̀ dị̀&quot; (&#x27;located&#x27;) + &quot;n&quot; (&quot;nà&quot;, &#x27;within&#x27;) + &quot;àla&quot; (the one god) [consisting of Elu above (the heavens) and Ala, below (the earth)]. Other dialectal variants include &quot;ọdịnanị&quot;, &quot;ọdịnana&quot;, &quot;omenala&quot;, &quot;omenana&quot;, and &quot;omenanị&quot;. The word ọdịnala and all its variations is also associated with the culture and customary laws of the Igbo people. Many of the laws and culture were counterparts with religion such as taboos and laws concerning sacred spaces like a deity&#x27;s sacred forest. Since customary law is recognised in Nigeria, many in Igbo society find themselves syncretising these beliefs with other beliefs and religions.

==Beliefs==

Ọdịnala could loosely be described as a polytheistic and panentheistic faith with a strong central spiritual force at its head from which all things are believed to spring; however, the contextual diversity of the system may encompass various theistic perspectives that derive from a variety of beliefs held within the religion. Chukwu as the central deity is classed among the , &#x27;invisible beings&#x27;, an ontological category of beings which includes &quot;Ala&quot; the divine feminine earth force, &quot;chi&quot; the &#x27;personal deity&#x27;, the ancestors, and the minor spirits. The other ontological category consists of &quot;ndi mmadu&quot;, &#x27;visible beings&#x27;, which include &quot;ánụ́&quot; animals, &quot;ósísí&quot; plants, and the final class &quot;ùrò&quot; which consists of elements, minerals and inanimate beings. While various gods, the spirit class of Arusi, and ancestors are worshiped and prayed to; no sacrifices are given to Chukwu and no shrines and altars are erected for it. If an Arusi is assigned to an individual, it becomes a chi, a personal guardian god/spirit.

Complex animism builds the core concept of most traditional African religions, including Odinala, this includes the worship of tutelary deities, nature worship, ancestor worship and the belief in an afterlife. While some religions adopted a pantheistic worldview, most follow a polytheistic system with various gods, spirits and other supernatural beings. Traditional African religions also have elements of fetishism, shamanism and veneration of relics.

Nigerian American professor of indigenous African religions at Harvard University, Jacob Olupona summarized the many traditional African religions as complex animistic religious traditions and beliefs of the African people before the Christian and Islamic &quot;colonization&quot; of Africa. Ancestor veneration has always played a &quot;significant&quot; part in the traditional African cultures and may be considered as central to the African worldview. Ancestors (ancestral ghosts/spirits) are an integral part of reality. The ancestors are generally believed to reside in an ancestral realm (spiritworld), while some believe that the ancestors became equal in power to deities.Olupona rejects the western/Islamic definition of Monotheism and says that such concepts could not reflect the complex African traditions and are too simplistic. While some traditions have a supreme being (next to other deities), others have not. Monotheism does not reflect the multiplicity of ways that the traditional African spirituality has conceived of deities, gods, and spirit beings.

Chukwuemeka Mbaegbu from the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria, describes the Igbo religion&#x27;s system as &quot;Monopolytheism&quot;, referring to the belief in many distinct gods and spirits, but with one distant and unpersonalized supreme force, which resulted in the creation of everything, but is not a god per definition.

===Chi===

In Odinani, the Igbo people believe that each person has their own personal spiritual guardian called Chi (or &quot;ḿmúọ́&quot;), appointed to them before and at the time of their birth. The Chi remains with them for the rest of their lives on Earth. A person&#x27;s Chi is the personification of that individual&#x27;s fate, which is credited for an individual&#x27;s life&#x27;s successes, misfortunes and failures. The Igbo believe that their success in life is determined by their Chi, and that no man can rise past the greatness of his or her own Chi. In this respect, the concept of chi is analogous to the concept of a guardian angel in Christianity, the daemon in ancient Greek religion, and the genius in ancient Roman religion. Culturally, people are seen as the creators or makers of their own destiny. The breath of life is in the heart, &quot;óbì&quot;. Chi can be masculine and feminine. A &quot;Dibia&quot; can identify a person&#x27;s chi through divination (&quot;ájà&quot;) and advise adherents of ways to placate it. &quot;Éké&quot; is one&#x27;s ancestral guardian spirit but exists at the periphery of human life and remains a mystery to the people. Households usually contain a shrine for veneration of the Chi, which could be focused on a tree. In marriage a woman takes her chi shrine along with all her belongings to her matrimonial home. A shrine to ones chi is set up at daybreak to summon the spirit from the sun. The shrine of an individual&#x27;s chi is destroyed when they die. Around Nkarahia, in southern Igboland, there are the most elaborate chi shrines which are decorated with colourful china plates inset into the clay walls of the chi shrine building; the altars hold sacred emblems, while the polished mud benches hold offerings of china, glass, manillas, and food. As a marker of personal fortune or misfortune, good acts or ill, chi can be described as a focal point for &#x27;personal religion&#x27;.

===Cosmology===
The community of visible interacting beings and the cosmos is referred to as &quot;ụ̀wà&quot;, which includes all living things &quot;íhẹ́ ndi dị́ ńdụ̀&quot;, including animals and vegetation and their mineral elements which possess a vital force and are regarded as counterparts to invisible forces in the spirit world. These living things and geomorphological features of the world therefore possess a guardian deity. Igbo cosmology presents a balance between the feminine and masculine, perhaps, with a preponderance of female representation in Igbo lore. In Igbo cosmology, the world was divided into four corners by the high god corresponding to &quot;èké&quot; &quot;órìè&quot; &quot;àfọ̀&quot; &quot;ǹkwọ́&quot; which are the days of the week in the Igbo calendar regarded as market days. The universe is regarded as a composite of bounded spaces in an overlapping hemispherical structure, the total spaces are referred to as &quot;élú nà àlà&quot;. In one Igbo cosmological theory reported by W.R.G. Morton in the 1950s from an elder in Ibagwa Nike in northern Igboland, Chukwu sees that the sun travels across the world in the day time and then cuts into two in order for the moon to pass on a perpendicular route, and so the world is divided into four parts and four days. The quarterly division of the earth and the days makes the number four sacred (&quot;ńsọ́&quot;) to the Igbo. The &quot;élú nà àlà&quot; space is defined by two boundaries: &quot;élú ígwé&quot;, &#x27;sky&#x27;s limit&#x27; composed of heavenly bodies under the main forces of the &#x27;masculine&#x27; sun and &#x27;feminine&#x27; moon, and &quot;élú àlà&quot;, &#x27;earth or lands limit&#x27; consisting of the four material elements of fire and air (masculine), and earth and water (feminine).
The pattern of two and four recur in Chukwu&#x27;s creations. The days correspond to the four cardinal points and are its names in Igbo, èké east, órìè west, àfọ̀ north, ǹkwọ́ south. The Nri-Igbo claim the market days to have been introduced to the Igbo by their divine progenitor and king Eri in the 9th century after encountering the days as deities. These Arusi are venerated as the primary or as a major deity under Chineke in parts of Igboland. In terms of hierarchy, some communities recognise èké as the head of these Arusi, while others prioritise órìè and ǹkwọ́ first after the high god. Market days may have local deities representing the spirits in some places, in many southern Igbo towns Agwu is the patron of Eke, Ogwugwu the patron of Orie, Amadioha the patron of Afọ and Ala for Nkwọ.

The Cosmos itself is divided into &quot;four constituent complexes&quot; known as &quot;Okike&quot;, &quot;Alusi&quot;, &quot;Mmuo&quot;, and &quot;Uwa&quot;. Okike is the event of &quot;Creation&quot;, the Alusi are the lesser deities, Mmụọ are the spirits of the Ancestors and all other beings, and Uwa is the World.

===Justice===

Ọfọ and ogụ́ is a law of retributive justice. It vindicates anyone that is wrongly accused of a crime as long as their &quot;hands are clean&quot;. It is only a person who is on the righteous side of &quot;Ọfọ-na-Ogụ́&quot; that can call its name in prayer, otherwise such a person will face the wrath of Amadiọha (the god of thunder and lightning). Kola nut is used in ceremonies honour Chukwu, chi, Arusi and ancestors and is used as a method of professing innocence when coupled with libations. The Igbo often make clay altars and shrines of their deities which are sometimes anthropomorphic, the most popular example being the wooden statues of Ikenga. Typically, only men are allowed to make representational figures of supernatural forces.

===Afterlife and reincarnation===

The Igbo traditionally believe in an afterlife in the spirit world or dimension, where the deceased ancestors exist, and may influence the material world and their descendants. Ancestors are protectors and guardians of ones lineage, close friends and heritage, and may become to higher spirits (semi-gods), as in the case of many other traditional religions of the world. Sometimes however, ancestors may reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive. This is called &quot;ilọ-uwa.&quot; Reincarnation is seldom, but may happen occasionally, if a deceased person cannot enter the spirit world for various reasons or may be absorbed into a new-born if it would die immediately after birth. Unlike in Hinduism, humans can only be reincarnated as humans. Families hire fortune-tellers to reveal if the child harbours the soul or an aspect of an ancestor; the baby is sometimes named after this relative. The personality of the ancestor is not identical to the child&#x27;s but rather the concept establishes a vital relationship with the child and characteristics of the ancestor. Other signs can be certain behaviors, physical traits, and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting if the child has reincarnated from an ancestor and may identify this ancestor. It is considered an insult if a male is said to have been reincarnated as a female. An ancestor (or aspects of the ancestor) may be reincarnated in multiple people, in which case the reincarnations share a mortal bond; upon the death of one person, it is believed that the others may die a sudden death if they see the corpse.

====Ogbanje====

An &quot;ọgbanje&quot; is a reincarnating evil or revengeful spirit, that would deliberately plague a family with misfortune. In folklore, the &quot;ọgbanje&quot;, upon being born by the mother, would deliberately die after a certain amount of time (usually before puberty) and then come back and repeat the cycle, causing the family grief. This time period varies between minutes, hours, days and years. Female circumcision was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit. Finding the evil spirit&#x27;s &quot;Iyi-uwa&quot;, which is buried in a secret location, would ensure that the &quot;ọgbanje&quot; would never plague the family with misfortune again. The &quot;Iyi-uwa&quot; is a stone that the &quot;ọgbanje&#x27;s&quot; way of coming back to the human world and is also a way of finding its targeted family. The stone is usually buried deep enough to not have been hidden by a child. The &quot;iyi-uwa&quot; is dug out by a priest and destroyed. Female &quot;ọgbanje&quot; die during pregnancies along with the baby, male &quot;ọgbanje&quot; die before the birth of a wife&#x27;s baby or the baby dies. The child is confirmed to no longer be an &quot;ọgbanje&quot; after the destruction of the stone or after the mother successfully gives birth to another baby.

==Deities==

The Arusi, who are also known as &quot;the Arushi&quot;, &quot;Anusi&quot; or &quot;Alusi&quot; by dialects (see Orisha, the Yoruba cognate), all spring from Ala the Earth goddess and Goddess of Fertility, who embodies the workings of the World. They are lesser deities in Odinani, each of whom are responsible for a specific aspect of nature or abstract concept. According to Igbo lore, these lesser deities as elements of Chukwu have their own specific purpose. They exist only as long their purpose does, thus many Alusi die off save for those who represent universal concepts. Some of the more notable male Alusi include: Amadioha the God of Thunder and Lightning, popular among the Southern Igbo; Ikenga the horned god of Fortune and Industry; Agwu the God of Divination and Healing; Njoku Ji the God of Yam, and Ogbunabali the God of Death. In southern Igbo dialects especially, &quot;ágbàrà&quot; is the term for these forces.

&quot;Arusi&quot; manifest in natural elements and their shrines are usually found in forests in which they are based around specific trees. At shrines, &quot;íhú mmúọ́&quot;, an object such as a hung piece of cloth or a group of statues, are placed at an &quot;Arusi&#x27;s&quot; group of trees to focus worship. Deities are described as &#x27;hot&#x27; and often capricious so that much of the public approach shrines cautiously and are advised to avoid them at most times; priests are entrusted in the maintenance of most shrines. Many of these shrines are by the roadside in rural areas. Tender palm fronds symbolize spiritual power and are objects of sacred power. Shrines are cordoned off with &quot;ọmu&quot; to caution the public of the deity&#x27;s presence. Larger clay modelings in honor of an &quot;Arusi&quot; also exist around forests and rivers. Other &quot;Arusi&quot; figures may be found in and around peoples&#x27; homes and the shrines of &quot;Dibia.&quot; Much of these are related to personal chi, cults, and ancestral worship.

===Ala===
Ala (meaning &#x27;earth&#x27; and &#x27;land&#x27; in Igbo, also &quot;Ájá-ànà&quot;) is the feminine earth spirit who is responsible for morality, fertility and the dead ancestors who are stored in the underworld in her womb. Ala is at the head of the Igbo pantheon, maintaining order and carrying out justice against wrongdoers. Ala is the most prominent and worshipped Arusi, almost every Igbo village has a shrine dedicated to her called &quot;íhú Ala&quot; where large decisions are taken. Ala is believed to be involved in all aspects of human affairs including festivals and at offerings. Ala stands for fertility and things that generate life including water, stone and vegetation, colour (&quot;àgwà&quot;), beauty (&quot;mmá&quot;) which is connected to goodness in Igbo society, and uniqueness (&quot;ájà&quot;). She is a symbol of morality who sanctioned &quot;omenala&quot; Igbo customs from which these moral and ethical behaviours are upheld in Igbo society. Ala is the ground itself, and for this reason taboos and crimes are known as &quot;ńsọ́ Ala&quot; (&#x27;desecration of Ala&#x27;), all land is holy as the embodiment of Ala making her the principal legal sanctioning authority. Prohibitions include murder, suicide, theft, incest, and abnormalities of birth such as in many places the birth of twins and the killing and eating of pregnant animals, if a slaughtered animal is found to be pregnant sacrifices are made to Ala and the foetus is buried. People who commit suicides are not buried in the ground or given burial rites but cast away in order not to further offend and pollute the land, their ability to become ancestors is therefore nullified. When an individual dies a &#x27;bad death&#x27; in the society, such as from the effects of divine retributive justice or breaking a taboo, they are not buried in the earth, but are discarded in a forest so as not to offend Ala. As in cases of most Arusi, Ala has the ability to be malevolent if perceived to be offended and can cause harm against those who offend her.
Within the earth&#x27;s spherical limit, in a cosmological sense, is a designation of the &#x27;earth&#x27;s bosom&#x27; within, , a hemispherical base to the earth with an opening or &#x27;mouth&#x27; at its highest point, &quot;ónụ́ àlà&quot;. This is composed of mainly deep dark sea water (). Ime ala is considered as the underworld. Ala in addition to embodying nature, is the cosmic base on which the vault of heaven, , rests. As the foundation of all existence, children&#x27;s umbilical cords are saved and symbolically buried under a tree to mark the child&#x27;s first sharing of family owned lands; this tree could either be an oil palm, bread-fruit tree, raffia palm, or plantain tree depending on the cultural region. In some places, such as Nri, the royal python, &quot;éké&quot;, is considered a sacred and tame agent of Ala and a harbinger of good fortune when found in a home. The python is referred to as &quot;nne&quot; &#x27;mother&#x27; in areas where the python is revered, it is a symbol of female beauty and gentleness. Killing of the python is expressly forbidden in these places and sanctions are taken against the killer including the funding of expensive human sized burials that are given to slain pythons.

===Amadioha===

Amadioha (from &quot;ámádí&quot; + &quot;ọ̀hà&quot;, &#x27;free will of the people&#x27; in Igbo) is the Arusi of justice, thunder, lightning and the sky. He is referred to as &quot;Amadioha&quot; in southern Igboland, &quot;Kamalu&quot;, &quot;Kamanu&quot;, &quot;Kalu&quot; among the Aro and other Cross River Igbo people, &quot;Igwe&quot; among the Isuama Igbo and in northwestern Igboland, and &quot;Ofufe&quot; in certain parts of Igboland. His governing planet is the Sun. His color is red, and his symbol is a white ram. Metaphysically, Amadioha represents the collective will of the people and he is often associated with Anyanwu. He is the expression of divine justice and wrath against taboos and crimes; in oaths he is sworn by and strikes down those who swear falsely with thunder and lightning. Amadioha shrines exist around Igboland, his main shrine is located at Ozuzu in the riverine Igbo region in northern Rivers State. While Anyanwu is more prominent in northern Igboland, Amadioha is more prominent in the south. His day is Afọ, which is the second market day. In mbari houses Amadioha is depicted beside Ala as her consort.

===Ikenga===

Ikenga (literally &#x27;place of strength&#x27;) is an Arusi and a cult figure of the right hand and success found among the northern Igbo people. He is an icon of meditation exclusive to men and owners of the sculpture dedicate and refer to it as their &#x27;right hand&#x27; which is considered instrumental to personal power and success. Ikenga is a source of encoded knowledge unraveled through psychological principles. The image of Ikenga comprises someone&#x27;s &quot;chi&quot; (&#x27;personal god&#x27;), his (ancestors), &quot;aka Ikenga&quot; (right hand), &quot;ike&quot; (power) as well as spiritual activation through prayer and sacrifice. Igbo cultures value of resourcefulness and individualism in society utilises the concept of Ikenga to regulate the relationship between individuality and family relations and obligations, as well as free will and industriousness balanced with destiny decided persons chi. Ikenga acts as a physical medium to the consciousness and emphasises individual initiative through reflection and meditation. Success validates the Ikenga and the sculptures act as visual representation of a person&#x27;s inner success, people give offerings in thanks to the Ikenga after providing energy to overcome any unwanted pre-life choices. These choices are at the hands of the persons earth bound spirit, mmuo, who chooses sex, type, and lifespan before incarnation. The successful Ikenga influenced the saying of well-being &#x27;íkéǹgàm kwụ̀ ọ̀tọ́ ta ta&#x27; meaning that &#x27;my Ikenga stands upright today&#x27;. During festivals of &quot;Ogbalido&quot; or (&#x27;feast of Ikenga&#x27;) sculptures of him may be paraded around a village or displayed at the village centre if too monumental to transport. When a person does not become successful with hard work the Ikenga has &#x27;fallen&#x27; and is seen as a sign of danger, if meditation and cajoling the Ikenga fails, the sculpture is &#x27;thrown down&#x27; and broken which spiritually kills the Ikenga; a new one is carved to replace it.

Ikenga figures are common cultural artefacts ranging for six inches to 6 feet high and can be humanistic or highly stylised. There are anthropomorphic, architectonic, and abstract cylindrical Ikenga sculptures. Ikenga is a symbol of success and personal achievement. Ikenga is mostly maintained, kept or owned by men and occasionally by women of high reputation and integrity in the society. At burials, a man&#x27;s Ikenga is broken into two with one piece buried with him and the other destroyed.

===Ekwensu===

This Arusi was adept at bargains and trade, and praying to Ekwensu was said to guarantee victory in negotiations. As a force of change and chaos, Ekwensu also represented the spirit of war among the Igbo, invoked during times of conflict and banished during peacetime to avoid his influences inciting bloodshed in the community, warriors set up shrines to Ekwensu to help war efforts. This is based upon the finding of old shrines dedicated to the worship of the spirit, as well as the recounting of old oral stories which depict the character of Ekwensu. Ekwensu was a bringer of violence and possessed people with anger. Ekwensu holds the propensity of bringing misfortune and is regarded as an evil spirit in this sense. Among the Christian Igbo Ekwensu is representative of Satan and is seen as a force which places itself opposite to that of Chukwu. Ekwensu festivals are held in some Igbo towns where military success is celebrated and wealth is flaunted.

===Mmuo and minor gods===
Mmụọ is a broad class of minor gods and spirits or divinities manifesting in natural elements under the class of elder divinities with major cults. Feminine mmụọ inhabit earth and water and masculine mmụọ inhabit fire and air. This class can be broken down by the &quot;Arusi&quot;, serviceable mmụọ, &quot;àgwụ&quot; are related to unusual and deranged human behaviours, these spirits interact with human in a capricious nature that often makes them dangerous. Other cult deities exist around Igboland such as Njoku Ji, yam and fire deity overseeing agriculture, Idemili, &#x27;the pillar of water&#x27;, the female Arusi based in Idemili North and South who holds up the waters, and Mbatuku the &#x27;bringer of wealth&#x27; or &#x27;coming in of wealth&#x27;. In addition to minor spirits there are evil wondering spirits of wrong doers called &quot;ogbonuke&quot;.

Among the Mmuo are:

* Mbatuku: spirit of wealth
* Ikoro: drum spirit
* Ekwu: heart spirit or spirit of the home
* Imo miri: river spirit
* Okwara-afo: for Nkwerre people in Imo state is god of mercantile activities
* Aju-mmiri: sea-goddess in Nkwerre is goddess of prosperity, fertility and general well-being.
* Ogbuide: goddess of the water associated with the Oguta people.
* Urashi and Enyija: god of the river
* Ezenwaanyi/Owummiri: Female Water Spirit, Mermaid, Seductress

==Practices==

===Dibia===

Dibia are the mystic mediators between the human world and the spirit world and act as healers, scribes, teachers, diviners and advisors of people in the community. They are usually consulted at the shrine of a communities major deity. &quot;Dibia&quot; is a compound of the words &quot;di&quot; (&#x27;professional, master, husband&#x27;) + &quot;ọ́bị̀à&quot; (&#x27;doctoring, sciences&#x27;). The dibia are believed to be destined for spiritual work. The dibia sees the spiritual world at any time and interprets what messages being sent and sees the spiritual problems of living people. They are given the power by the spirit world to identify any alusi by name and the possible ways of placating and negotiating with the deity. Dibia are thought to be revealed to possess the power over one of three elements namely water (and large bodies of water), fire and vegetation. Dibia whose elements are vegetation can go on to become herbalists by their supposed instinctual knowledge of the health benefits of certain plants they are instinctually drawn to, fire element dibia can handle fire unscathed during their initiation, and water element dibia do not drown. Dibia can partially enter the spirit world and communicate this by rubbing chalk on one half of their face. Dibia and obia practices were transported to the West Indies as a result of the Atlantic slave trade and became known as &quot;obeah&quot;.

====Afa divination====
The name of divination in Igbo derives from &quot;ígbá áfà&quot; or &quot;áhà&quot; meaning &#x27;to name&#x27; coming from the diviner&#x27;s skill in rooting out problems hence naming them. The dibia or &quot;ogba afa&quot;, &#x27;interpreter of afa&#x27;, is considered a master of esoteric knowledge and wisdom and igba afa is a way in which people can find out the cause of such things as misfortunes. The diviner interprets codes from &quot;àlà mmuọ&quot; the unseen by throwing divination seeds, cowries, and beads, or observing a divination board sometimes called &quot;osho&quot; which can be used in pronouncing curses on the evil. In this way the diviner is endowed with special sight. it is related the sciences of homeopathic medicine known as &quot;ọ́gwụ̀&quot;, a practitioner consciously picks to either of these abilities. 
Animals that are special in divination and sacrifice include a white he-goat, a white ram, a tortoise and male wall gecko. These animals are prized for their rarity, price and therefore the journey taken to obtain. Chameleons and rats are used for more stronger medicines and deadly poisons, and antidotes can include lambs, small chickens, eggs, and oils. Nzu is used in rites from birth to death and is used to mark sacred buildings and spaces. Agwu Nsi is the Igbo patron deity of health and divination and is related to insanity, confusion, and unusual human behaviour which is linked to possession of Agwu by the diviner. Agwu can be manifested by other alusi so that there could be images of a divination Ikenga or &quot;Ikenga Agwu&quot; for instance.

===Ancestral veneration===

Ndebunze, or , are the deceased ancestors who are considered to be in the spirit world, . In Odinani, it is believed that the dead ancestors are invisible members of the community; their role in the community, in conjunction with Ala, is to protect the community from epidemics and strife such as famine and smallpox. Ancestors helped chi look after men. Shrines for the ancestors in Igbo society were made in the central house, or &quot;òbí&quot; or &quot;òbú&quot;, of the patriarch of a housing compound. The patriarchal head of the household is in charge of venerating the patriarchal ancestors through libations and offerings, through this the living maintain contact with the dead. Only a patriarch whose father is dead, and therefore in the spirit world where they await reincarnation into the community, were able to venerate ancestors. Female ancestors were called upon by matriarchs. At the funeral of a man&#x27;s father there is a hierarchy in Igbo culture of animals that will be killed and eaten in his honor. Usually this depended on the rarity and price of the animal, so a goat or a sheep were common and relatively cheaper, and therefore carried less prestige, while a cow is considered a great honor, and a horse the most exceptional. Horses cannot be given for women. Horses were more common among the northeastern Igbo due to tsetse fly zone that Igboland is situated in and renders it an unsuitable climate for horses. Horse heads are traditionally decorated and kept in a reliquary and at shrines.

A number of major masking institutions exist around Igboland that honour ancestors and reflect the spirit world in the land of the living. Young women, for example, are incarnated in the society through the àgbọ́ghọ̀ mmúọ́ masking tradition in which mean represent ideal and benevolent spirits of maidens of the spirit world in the form of feminine masks. These masks are performed at festivals at agricultural cycles and at funerals of prominent individuals in the society.

===Kola nut===

Kola nut (, or ) offerings and prayers (, &#x27;kola nut blessing&#x27;, , &#x27;kola nut breaking&#x27;) can be performed personally between one and his spirit or in a group in a form of a prayer or chant. The saluter addresses their personal god or chi as well as alusi and their ancestors. These kola nuts are held in a special round bowl called with a compartment at the centre of the bowl for condiments for the kola nut such as alligator pepper (or &quot;capsicum cayenne&quot;, ) and ground peanuts. The bowl and kola nut rite is used to welcome visitors into a household. After the prayer, the ceremony ends with the saluter sharing pieces of the kola with the group, known as . The kola is supposed to cut by hand, but more recently knives have become acceptable. When the cola has three cotyledons, or parts, it is considered an in some northern communities (going by other names in communities Ikenga does not operate) and is considered a sign of great luck, bravery and nobility. — &#x27;one who brings kola brings life&#x27; is a popular saying that points to the auspiciousness of the kola rite.

== Folktales ==
The Igbos have been known to pass down their culture from generation to generation with the use of verbal (largely undocumented) stories. Examples include:
===Architecture===

====Mbari====

Among a small area of the Urata-Igbo cultural area, near Owerri, there is a tradition of building votive monument houses called &quot;ḿbàrí&quot; primarily dedicated to the &quot;ágbàrà&quot; Àlà specific to the community and sometimes other community deities. The name joins the word &quot;ḿbà&quot; (&#x27;nation, town, society&#x27;) + &quot;rí&quot; (&#x27;eat&#x27;) in reference to the &#x27;festival of life&#x27; held after its completion. These votive shrines are typically designed with four columns and a central volt, around the columns are modelled deities, spirits, and depictions of human life, the entire building built out of clay from termite mounds symbolically named &quot;jí&quot; (&#x27;yam&#x27;) by the initiated spirit workers called &quot;ńdí m̀gbè&quot;. Ndi mgbe are secluded from the community for a couple of months during the rites of building the mbari to a deity. Mbari are requested by a deity who the diviner tells the community feels neglected and cannot feel pride in the face of other deities in the spirit world. A string of unusual and unfortunate events befalling the community is linked to the aggrieved deity. An mbari is commissioned and artists are chosen. After the completion of the mbari the spirit workers are reincorporated into the community and a feast is held for the opening of the mbari house where elders and the community come to exhibit the critique the expensive mbari. The mbari house is not a source of worship and is left to dilapidate, being reabsorbed by nature in symbolic sense related to Ala.

====Uto pyramids====

Before the twentieth century, circular stepped pyramids were built in reverence of Ala at the town of Nsude in northern Igboland. In total ten clay/mud pyramidal structures were still existing in 1935. The base section of a pyramid was in circumference and in height. The next stack was in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto who was believed to live at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god&#x27;s residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.

<text>The AIM alliance, also known as the PowerPC alliance, was formed on October 2, 1991, between Apple, IBM, and Motorola. Its goal was to create an industry-wide open-standard computing platform based on the POWER instruction set architecture. It was intended to solve legacy problems, future-proof the industry, and compete with Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly and the Wintel duopoly. The alliance yielded the launch of Taligent, Kaleida Labs, the PowerPC CPU family, the Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP) hardware platform standard, and Apple&#x27;s Power Macintosh computer line.

==History==
===Development===

From the 1980s into the 1990s, the computer industry was moving from a model of just individual personal computers toward an interconnected world, where no single company could afford to be vertically isolated anymore. &quot;Infinite Loop&quot; says &quot;most people at Apple knew the company would have to enter into ventures with some of its erstwhile enemies, license its technology, or get bought&quot;. Furthermore, Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly and the Wintel duopoly threatened competition industrywide, and the Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) consortium was underway.

Phil Hester, a designer of the IBM RS/6000, convinced IBM&#x27;s president Jack Kuehler of the necessity of a business alliance. Kuehler called Apple President Michael Spindler, who bought into the approach for a design that could challenge the Wintel-based PC. Apple CEO John Sculley was even more enthusiastic.

On July 3, 1991, Apple and IBM signed a non-contractual letter of intent, proposing an alliance and outlining its long-term strategic technology goals. Its main goal was creating a single unifying open-standard computing platform for the whole industry, made of a new hardware design and a next-generation operating system. IBM intended to bring the Macintosh operating system into the enterprise and Apple intended to become a prime customer for the new POWER hardware platform. Considering it to be critically poorly communicated and confusing to the outside world at this point, industry commentators nonetheless saw this partnership as an overall competitive force against Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly and Intel&#x27;s and Microsoft&#x27;s duopoly. IBM and Motorola would have 300 engineers to codevelop chips at a joint manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas. Motorola would sell the chips to Apple or anyone else.

Between the three companies, more than 400 people had been involved to define a more unified corporate culture with less top-down executive decree. They collaborated as peers and future coworkers in creating the alliance and the basis of its ongoing future dialog which promised to &quot;change the landscape of computing in the 90s&quot;.

===Launch===

On October 2, 1991, the historic AIM alliance was officially formed with a contract between Apple CEO John Sculley, IBM Research and Development Chief Jack Kuehler, and IBM Vice President James Cannavino. Kuehler said &quot;Together we announce the second decade of personal computing, and it begins today&quot; and Sculley said this would &quot;launch a renaissance in technological innovation&quot;, as they signed the foot-high stack of papers comprising the contract. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an act that a year ago almost no one in the computer world would have imagined possible&quot;. It was so sweeping that it underwent antitrust review by the United States federal government.

In 1992, Apple and IBM created two new companies called Taligent and Kaleida Labs as had been declared in the alliance contract, with the expectation that neither would launch any products until the mid-90s. Since 1988, Apple had already created a next-generation operating system, codenamed &quot;Pink&quot;; and Taligent Inc. was incorporated to bring Pink to market as the ultimate crossplatform object-oriented OS and application frameworks. Kaleida was to create an object-oriented, cross-platform multimedia scripting language which would enable developers to create entirely new kinds of applications that would harness the power of the platform. IBM provided affinity between its own Workplace OS and Taligent, replacing Taligent&#x27;s microkernel with the IBM Microkernel and adopting Taligent&#x27;s CommonPoint application framework into Workplace OS, OS/2, and AIX.

CISC microprocessors, including the mainstream Intel x86 products, were considered an evolutionary dead end, and that because RISC was the future, the next few years were a period of great opportunity.

The alliance&#x27;s hardware is based on the PowerPC processorsthe first of which, the PowerPC 601, is a single-chip version of IBM&#x27;s POWER1 CPU. Both IBM and Motorola would manufacture PowerPC integrated circuits for this new platform. The computer architecture base is called &quot;PReP&quot; (PowerPC Reference Platform), later complemented with OpenFirmware and renamed &quot;CHRP&quot; (Common Hardware Reference Platform). IBM used PReP and CHRP for the PCI version of IBM&#x27;s RS/6000 platform, which was adapted from existing Micro Channel architecture models, and changed only to support the new 60x bus style of the PowerPC.

In 1994, Apple delivered its first alliance-based hardware platform, the PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line, on schedule as predicted by the original alliance contract. &quot;Infinite Loop&quot; considered the PowerPC to be five years too late to the overall market, &quot;no more than a welcome offering to Apple&#x27;s own market base&quot;, and further hamstrung by the legacy architecture of System 7.

===Downturn===
In 1995, IT journalist Don Tennant asked Bill Gates to reflect upon &quot;what trend or development over the past 20 years had really caught him by surprise&quot;. Gates responded with what Tennant described as biting, deadpan sarcasm: &quot;Kaleida and Taligent had less impact than we expected.&quot; Tennant believed the explanation to be that &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s worst nightmare is a conjoined Apple and IBM. No other single change in the dynamics of the IT industry could possibly do as much to emasculate Windows.&quot;

Efforts by Motorola and IBM to popularize PReP and CHRP failed when Apple, IBM, and Taligent all failed to provide a single comprehensive reference operating system for server and personal markets—mainly Taligent&#x27;s OS or IBM&#x27;s Workplace OS. Windows NT was the only OS with mainstream consumer recognition that had been ported to PowerPC, but there was virtually no market demand for it on this non-mainstream hardware. Although PowerPC was eventually supported by several Unix variants, Windows NT, and Workplace OS (in the form of OS/2), these operating systems generally ran just as well on commodity Intel-based hardware so there was little reason to use the PReP systems. The BeBox, designed to run BeOS, uses some PReP hardware but is overall incompatible with the standard. Kaleida Labs closed in 1995. Taligent was absorbed into IBM in 1998. Some CHRP machines shipped in 1997 and 1998 without widespread reception.

Relations between Apple and Motorola further deteriorated in 1998 with the return of Steve Jobs to Apple and his contentious termination of Power Macintosh clone licensing. Reportedly, a heated telephone conversation between Jobs and Motorola CEO Christopher Galvin resulted in the long-favored Apple being demoted to &quot;just another customer&quot;, mainly for PowerPC CPUs. In retaliation, Apple and IBM briefly expelled Motorola from the AIM alliance, and forced Motorola to stop making PowerPC CPUs, leaving IBM to design and produce all future PowerPC chips. Motorola was reinstated into the alliance in 1999.

==Legacy==
The PowerPC is the clearest intended success that came out of the AIM alliance. From 1994 to 2006, Apple used PowerPC chips in almost every Macintosh. PowerPC also has had success in the embedded market, and in video game consoles: GameCube, Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

After being reinstated into the AIM alliance, Motorola helped IBM to design some laptop PowerPC chips with IBM&#x27;s manufacturing. In 2004, Motorola spun off its Semiconductor production as Freescale Semiconductor, and left the AIM alliance completely, leaving IBM and Apple in the alliance. Freescale continued to help IBM design PowerPC chips until Freescale was acquired and absorbed by NXP Semiconductors in 2015.

Apple transitioned entirely to Intel CPUs in 2006, due to eventual disappointment with the direction and performance of PowerPC development as of the G5 model, especially in the fast-growing laptop market. This was seen as the end of the AIM alliance as that left IBM as the sole user of PowerPC.

Taligent was launched from the original AIM alliance, based originally on Apple&#x27;s Pink operating system. From Taligent came the CommonPoint application framework and many global contributions to internationalization and compilers, in the form of Java Development Kit 1.1, VisualAge C++, and the International Components for Unicode open source project.

Power.org was founded in 2004 by IBM and fifteen partners with intent to develop, enable, and promote Power Architecture technology, such as PowerPC, POWER, and software applications.

The OpenPOWER Foundation is a collaboration around Power ISA-based products initiated by IBM and announced as the &quot;OpenPOWER Consortium&quot; on August 6, 2013. It has more than 250 members. In 2019, IBM announced its open-sourcing of the Power ISA.

<text>Great Yarmouth ( ), often called Yarmouth, is a seaside town which gives its name to the wider Borough of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, England; it straddles the River Yare and is located east of Norwich. Its fishing industry, mainly for herring, shrank after the mid-20th century and has all but ended. North Sea oil from the 1960s supplied an oil rig industry that services offshore natural gas rigs; more recently, offshore wind power and other renewable energy industries have ensued.

Yarmouth has been a resort since 1760 and a gateway from the Norfolk Broads to the North Sea. Holidaymaking rose when a railway opened in 1844, bringing easier, cheaper access and some new settlement. Wellington Pier opened in 1854 and Britannia Pier in 1858. Through the 20th century, Yarmouth boomed as a resort, with a promenade, pubs, trams, fish-and-chip shops, theatres, the Pleasure Beach, the Sea Life Centre, the Hippodrome Circus, the Time and Tide Museum and a Victorian seaside Winter Garden in cast iron and glass.

==Geography and demography==
Great Yarmouth is located on a spit of land between the North Sea and River Yare. It features historic rows of houses in narrow streets and a main tourist sector on the seafront. It is linked to Gorleston, Cobholm and Southtown by Haven Bridge and to the A47 and A149 by Breydon Bridge. The urban area covers and according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2002 had a population of 47,288. It is the main town in the Borough of Great Yarmouth.

The ONS identifies a Great Yarmouth urban area as having a population of 68,317, which includes the sub-areas of Caister-on-Sea (population 8,756) and Great Yarmouth (population 58,032). The wider Great Yarmouth borough had a population of around 92,500, which increased to 97,277 at the 2011 United Kingdom census. Ethnically, Great Yarmouth was 92.8 per cent White British, with the next biggest ethnic demographic being Other White at 3.5 per cent – Eastern Europeans in the main.

==History==
Great Yarmouth (Gernemwa, Yernemuth) lies near the site of the Roman fort camp of Gariannonum at the mouth of the River Yare. Its situation having attracted fishermen from the Cinque Ports, a permanent settlement was made, and the town numbered 70 burgesses before the Norman Conquest. Henry I placed it under the rule of a reeve.

In 1101 the Church of St Nicholas was founded by Herbert de Losinga, the first Bishop of Norwich, and consecrated in 1119. This was to be the first of several priories founded in what was a wealthy trading centre of considerable importance. In 1208, King John granted a charter to Great Yarmouth. The charter gave his burgesses of Yarmouth general liberties according to the customs of Oxford, a gild merchant and weekly hustings, amplified by several later charters asserting the rights of the borough against Little Yarmouth and Gorleston. The town is bound to send to the sheriffs of Norwich every year &quot;one hundred herrings, baked in twenty four pasties&quot;, which the sheriffs are to deliver to the lord of the manor of East Carlton who is then to convey them to the King.

A hospital was founded in Great Yarmouth during the reign of Edward I by Thomas Fastolfe, father of Thomas Fastolf, Bishop of St David&#x27;s. In 1551, a grammar school founded and the great hall of the old hospital was appropriated for its use. The school was closed from 1757 to 1860 but re-established by charity trustees and settled in new buildings in 1872.
In 1552, Edward VI granted a charter of admiralty jurisdiction, later confirmed and extended by James I. Elizabeth I came to Great Yarmouth in July 1578. In 1668 a charter from Charles II extended the borough boundaries to also include Little Yarmouth (also known as Southtown), which lay on the opposite bank of the Yare in the parish of Gorleston in Suffolk. In 1703 a new charter from Queen Anne replaced the two bailiffs by a mayor. In 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Zealand Expedition was assembled in the town. In 1702 the Fishermen&#x27;s Hospital was founded. In the early 18th century, Yarmouth, as a thriving herring port, was vividly and admiringly described several times in Daniel Defoe&#x27;s travel journals, in part as follows:
Yarmouth is an ancient town, much older than Norwich; and at present, tho&#x27; not standing on so much ground, yet better built; much more compleat; for number of inhabitants, not much inferior; and for wealth, trade, and advantage of its situation, infinitely superior to Norwich.

It is plac&#x27;d on a peninsula between the River Yare and the sea; the two last lying parallel to one another, and the town in the middle: The river lies on the west-side of the town, and being grown very large and deep, by a conflux of all the rivers on this side the county, forms the haven; and the town facing to the west also, and open to the river, makes the finest key in England, if not in Europe, not inferior even to that of Marseille itself.

The ships ride here so close, and as it were, keeping up one another, with their head-fasts on shore, that for half a mile [800 m] together, they go cross the stream with their bolsprits over the land, their bowes, or heads, touching the very wharf; so that one may walk from ship to ship as on a floating bridge, all along by the shore-side: The key reaching from the drawbridge almost to the south-gate, is so spacious and wide, that in some places &#x27;tis near one hundred yards from the houses to the wharf. In this pleasant and agreeable range of houses are some very magnificent buildings, and among the rest, the custom-house and town-hall, and some merchants houses, which look like little palaces, rather than the dwelling-houses of private men.

The greatest defect of this beautiful town, seems to be, that tho&#x27; it is very rich and encreasing in wealth and trade, and consequently in people, there is not room to enlarge the town by building; which would be certainly done much more than it is, but that the river on the land-side prescribes them, except at the north end without the gate...

In 1797, during the French Revolutionary Wars, the town was the main supply base for the North Sea Fleet. The fleet collected at the Yarmouth Roads, from whence it sailed to the decisive Battle of Camperdown against the Dutch fleet.

Again in 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, the collected fleet sailed from the roadstead to the Battle of Copenhagen.

From 1808 to 1814, the Admiralty in London could communicate with its ships in Yarmouth by a shutter telegraph chain. Ships were routinely anchored offshore during the Napoleonic Wars and the town served as a supply base for the Royal Navy. Part of an Ordnance Yard survives from this period on Southtown Road, probably designed by James Wyatt: a pair of roadside lodges (which originally housed senior officers) frame the entrance to the site, which contains a sizeable armoury of 1806, a small barracks block and other ancillary buildings. Originally the depot extended down to a wharf on the River Yare and was flanked by a pair of storehouses, but these and other buildings were destroyed in The Blitz. A grander survival is the former Royal Naval Hospital designed by William Pilkington, begun in 1806 and opened in 1811. Consisting of four colonnaded blocks around a courtyard, it served as a naval psychiatric hospital, then as a barracks. The barrack-master was Captain George Manby, during his time in post he invented the Manby mortar. The premises was transferred to the NHS in 1958. After its closure in 1993, the buildings were turned into private residences.

The town was the site of a bridge disaster and drowning tragedy on 2 May 1845, when the Yarmouth suspension bridge crowded with children collapsed under the weight killing 79. They had gathered to watch a clown in a barrel being pulled by geese down the river. As he passed under the bridge the weight shifted, causing the chains on the south side to snap, tipping over the bridge deck.

Great Yarmouth had an electric tramway system from 1902 to 1933. From the 1880s until the First World War, the town was a regular destination for Bass Excursions, when fifteen trains would take 8,000–9,000 employees of Bass&#x27;s Burton brewery on an annual trip to the seaside.

During World War I, Great Yarmouth suffered the first aerial bombardment in the UK, by Zeppelin &quot;L3&quot; on 19 January 1915. That same year on 15 August, Ernest Martin Jehan became the first and only man to sink a steel submarine with a sail-rigged Q-ship, off the coast of Great Yarmouth. It was bombarded by the German Navy on 24 April 1916.
The town suffered from bombing raids by the German Luftwaffe during World War II, as the last significant place Germans could drop bombs before returning home, but much is left of the old town, including the original protective medieval wall, of which two-thirds has survived, and eleven of the eighteen towers remain. On the South Quay is a 17th-century Merchant&#x27;s House, as well as Tudor, Georgian and Victorian buildings. Behind South Quay is a maze of alleys and lanes known as &quot;The Rows&quot;. Originally there were 145. Despite war damage, several have remained.

The town was badly affected by the North Sea flood of 1953. More recent flooding has also been a problem, with four floods in 2006, the worst being in September. Torrential rain caused drains to block and an Anglian Water pumping station to break down, which caused flash flooding in which 90 properties were flooded up to .

On 1 April 1974, the civil parish of Great Yarmouth was abolished.

The southern section of the A47 Great Yarmouth Western Bypass opened in May 1985, with the northern section opened in March 1986. The bypass was re-numbered as part of the A12, until it returned to being part of the A47 in February 2017.

In February 2023, there was an explosion on River Yare when disposal of unexploded ordnance from World War II resulted in accidental detonation.

==Sightseeing and tourism==

The Tollhouse with dungeons, dating from the late 13th century, is one of Britain&#x27;s oldest former gaols and oldest civic buildings. It backs onto the central library. Major sections of the medieval town walls survive around the parish cemetery and in parts of the old town.

Great Yarmouth Minster (the Minster Church of St Nicholas, founded in the 12th century as an act of penance) stands in Church Plain, just off the market place. It is the third largest parish church in England, after Beverley Minster in the East Riding of Yorkshire and Christchurch Priory in Dorset. Neighbouring Church Plain has the 17th-century timber-framed house where Anna Sewell (1820–1878), author of &quot;Black Beauty&quot;, was born.

The market place, one of England&#x27;s largest, has functioned since the 13th century. It is also home to the town&#x27;s shopping sector and the famous Yarmouth chip stalls. The smaller area south of the market is used as a performance area for community events and for access to the town&#x27;s shopping centre, Market Gates.

Great Yarmouth railway station is the terminus of the Wherry Lines from Norwich. Before the Beeching Axe, the town had a number of stations and a direct link to London down the east coast. The only remaining signs of these is a coach park, where Beach Station once was, and the A12 relief road, which follows the route of the railway down into the embankment from Breydon Bridge.
Yarmouth has two piers: Britannia Pier (Grade II listed)) and Wellington Pier. The theatre building on the latter was demolished in 2005 and reopened in 2008 as a family entertainment centre, including a ten-pin bowling alley overlooking the beach. Britannia Pier holds the Britannia Theatre, which during the summer has featured acts such as Jim Davidson, Jethro, Basil Brush, Cannon and Ball, Chubby Brown, the Chuckle Brothers, and The Searchers. It is one of the few end-of-the pier theatres surviving in England.

The Scroby Sands Wind Farm of thirty generators is within sight of the seafront, with its giant wind generators. Also visible are grey seals during their breeding season. The country&#x27;s only full-time circus, Hippodrome Circus, is just off the seafront.

The Grade II listed Winter Gardens building sits next to the Wellington Pier. The cast iron, framed glass structure was shipped by barge from Torquay in 1903, ostensibly without the loss of a single pane of glass. Over the years, it has been used as ballroom, roller skating rink and beer garden. In the 1990s it was converted into a nightclub by Jim Davidson and has since been used as a family leisure venue. It is currently closed. In the meantime it has been named by the Victorian Society as a heritage building at risk of disrepair.

Great Yarmouth&#x27;s seafront, known as &quot;The Golden Mile&quot; attracts millions of visitors each year to its sandy beaches, indoor and outdoor attractions and amusement arcades. Great Yarmouth&#x27;s Marine Parade has twelve Amusement Arcades within , including: Atlantis, The Flamingo, Circus Circus, The Golden Nugget, The Mint, Leisureland, The Majestic, The Silver Slipper, The Showboat, Magic City, Quicksilver and The Gold Rush, opened in 2007. In addition to the two piers, tourist attractions on Marine Parade include Joyland, Pirates Cove Adventure Golf, Castaway Island Adventure Golf, the Marina Centre, the Sea Life Centre, Merrivale Model Village and the Pleasure Beach and Gardens.
In August 2019, the Venetian Waterways and gardens reopened. The waterways, running parallel to the main beach, were a feature constructed as a work-creation scheme in 1926–1928, consisting of canals and formal gardens, with rowing boats, pedalos and gondolas. These had been allowed to silt up, decay and become abandoned. With a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund of £1.7m and the labour of volunteers, the flowerbeds have been restored with 20,000 plants, and the 1920s cafe has been restored. That and the boat hire are being run by a social enterprise.

The South Denes area is home to the Grade I listed Norfolk Naval Pillar, known locally as the Britannia Monument or Nelson&#x27;s Monument. This tribute to Nelson was completed in 1819, 24 years before the completion of Nelson&#x27;s Column in London. The monument, designed by William Wilkins, shows Britannia standing atop a globe holding an olive branch in her right hand and a trident in her left. There is a popular assumption in the town that the statue of Britannia was supposed to face out to sea but now faces inland due to a mistake during construction, although it is thought she is meant to face Nelson&#x27;s birthplace at Burnham Thorpe. The monument was originally planned to mark Nelson&#x27;s victory at the Battle of the Nile, but fundraising was not completed until after his death and it was instead dedicated to England&#x27;s greatest naval hero. It is currently surrounded by an industrial estate but there are plans to improve the area. The Norfolk Nelson Museum on South Quay housed the Ben Burgess collection of Nelson memorabilia and was the only dedicated Nelson museum in England. Its several galleries looked at Nelson&#x27;s life and personality, and at what life was like for men who sailed under him. It closed in 2019.
Charles Dickens used Yarmouth as a key location in his novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, and described the town as &quot;the finest place in the universe&quot;. Dickens stayed at the Royal Hotel on the Marine Parade while writing the novel.

The Time and Tide Museum in Blackfriars Road, managed by Norfolk Museums Service, was nominated in the UK Museums Awards in 2005. It was built as part of a regeneration of the south of the town in 2003. Its location in an old herring smokery harks back to the town&#x27;s status as a major fishing port. Sections of the historic town wall stand opposite the museum, next to the Great Yarmouth Potteries, part of which is housed in another former smoke house. The town wall is among the most complete medieval town walls in the country, with 11 of the 18 original turrets still standing. Other museums in the town include the National Trust&#x27;s Elizabethan House, the Great Yarmouth Row Houses, managed by English Heritage, and the privately owned Blitz and Pieces, based on the Home Front during World War II.

The Maritime Heritage East partnership, based at the award-winning Time and Tide Museum aims to raise the profile of maritime heritage and museum collections.

In October 2021, street artist Banksy created a number of murals in the town as part of his set A Great British Spraycation.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Great Yarmouth, at district and county level: Great Yarmouth Borough Council and Norfolk County Council, based in Norwich. The borough council meets at Great Yarmouth Town Hall in Hall Plain, which is a Grade II* listed building.

Great Yarmouth was an ancient borough. The original borough was entirely on the north side of the Yare, which formed the historic boundary between Norfolk and Suffolk. After the borough was enlarged to include Southtown in 1668 the borough straddled the two counties. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, at which point the boundaries were enlarged to include all of the parish of Gorleston. When elected county councils were created in 1889, Great Yarmouth was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services and so it became a county borough, independent from Norfolk County Council. For ceremonial and judicial purposes the borough continued to straddle Norfolk and Suffolk until 1 April 1891 when the county boundary was adjusted to place the whole borough in Norfolk.

The County Borough of Great Yarmouth was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the larger Borough of Great Yarmouth, a lower-tier non-metropolitan district, with Norfolk County Council providing county-level services to the town for the first time. No successor parish was created for the area of the former county borough, which therefore became an unparished area, directly administered by Great Yarmouth Borough Council.

Great Yarmouth is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Its current MP, starting 5 July 2024, is Rupert Lowe of the Reform UK.

==Wildlife==

The Yarmouth area provides habitats for a number of rare and unusual species. The area between the piers is home to one of the largest roosts of Mediterranean gulls in the UK. Breydon Water, just behind the town, is a major wader and waterfowl site, with winter roosts of over 100,000 birds. Grey seal and common seal are frequently seen offshore, as are seabirds such as gannet, little auk, common scoter, razorbill, Gull and guillemot.

This and the surrounding Halvergate Marshes are environmentally protected. Most of the area is now managed by conservation organisations, principally the RSPB. The North Denes area of the beach is an SSSI due to its dune plants, and supports many skylarks and meadow pipits, along with one of the largest little tern colonies in the UK each summer, and a small colony of grayling butterflies. Other butterflies found include small copper and common blue.

The nearby cemetery is a renowned temporary roost for spring and autumn migrants. Common redstart and pied flycatcher are often seen during their migration. It has also recorded the first sightings of a number of rare insects blown in from the continent.

==Sport and leisure==
The main local football club is Great Yarmouth Town, known as the Bloaters, which plays in the Eastern Counties League. Its ground is at Wellesley Recreation Ground, named after Sir Arthur Wellesley, later to become the Duke of Wellington. There is strong East Anglian rivalry with Gorleston. Local football clubs are served by the Great Yarmouth and District League.

Great Yarmouth has a horse racecourse that features a chute allowing races of one mile () on the straight.

Speedway racing was staged before and after the Second World War. The meetings were held at the greyhound stadium in Caister Road. The post-war team was known as the Yarmouth Bloaters, after the smoked fish. Banger and Stock car racing are also staged there.

The main Marina leisure centre, built in 1981, has a large swimming pool and conference facilities; it holds live entertainment, such as summer pantomime variety shows produced by local entertainers Hanton &amp; Dean. The centre is run by the Great Yarmouth Sport and Leisure Trust. The Trust was set up in April 2006 to run the building as a charitable non-profit-making organisation.

At the beginning of the 2008 summer season, a world&#x27;s first Segway Grand Prix was opened at the Pleasure Beach gardens.

The English Pool Association (EPA), the governing body for 8-Ball Pool in England, holds its National Finals Competitions (including Inter-County and Inter-League, singles and team competitions, and England trials) over several weekends through the year at the Vauxhall Holiday Park on the outskirts of Great Yarmouth.

==Local media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals is received from the Tacolneston transmitter or from one of the two local relay transmitters (Great Yarmouth and Gorleston on Sea).

The town’s local radio stations are BBC Radio Norfolk on 95.1 FM, Heart East on 102.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Norfolk &amp; North Suffolk (formerly The Beach) on 103.4 FM, and Harbour Radio, a community radio station that broadcasts from the town on 107.4 FM.

The &quot;Great Yarmouth Mercury&quot; is the town&#x27;s weekly local newspaper, alongside the county-wide newspaper &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;.

==Transport==
===Railway===
The Wherry Lines link and Great Yarmouth railway station, with an hourly service operated by Greater Anglia; most services travel via , with the remainder via Reedham.

Before the Beeching cuts, there were three other railway lines that entered the town: 
* From the north: The Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway down the coast from Melton Constable to a terminus at Beach station;
* From the south-west: The Yarmouth-Beccles line from London Liverpool Street, via Beccles, terminating at South Town station;
* From the south: The Yarmouth-Lowestoft line from Lowestoft Central, via Hopton and Gorleston, terminating at South Town station.

The remaining Vauxhall station was renamed Great Yarmouth in 1989. It is the sole surviving station from a former total of seventeen within the borough limits.

===Buses===
The bus station in Great Yarmouth is the hub for local routes, located beneath Market Gates Shopping Centre. Services are operated predominantly by First Eastern Counties. The Excel X1 route, which links Norwich and Lowestoft, stops in the town. Other local bus services link the suburban areas of Martham, Hemsby, Gorleston, Bradwell and Belton.

===Port and river===

The River Yare cuts off Great Yarmouth from other areas of the borough such as Gorleston and Southtown; as a result, the town&#x27;s bridges became major transport links. Originally Haven Bridge was the only link over the river but, in the late 1980s, Breydon Bridge was built to take the A12 over Breydon Water, replacing the old railway bridge of Breydon Viaduct. In January 2020 construction began on a third river crossing, the Herring Bridge, which opened to traffic on 1 February 2024. All three are lifting bridges, which can be raised to allow river traffic to pass through; this can result in traffic tailbacks. The phrase &quot;the bridge was up&quot; has become synonymous in the town with being late for appointments.

A ferry running between the southern tip of Great Yarmouth and Gorleston provided a much shorter link between the factories on South Denes and the mostly residential areas of Gorleston. However, increased running costs and the decline of industrial activity led to its closure in the early 1990s.

Since 2006, the restored pleasure steamer the &quot;Southern Belle&quot; has offered regular river excursions from the town&#x27;s Haven Bridge. Built in 1925 for the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, she is now owned by the Great Yarmouth and Gorleston Steam Packet Company Limited.

Construction work on the Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour, a deep-water harbour on the North Sea, began in June 2007 and was completed by 2009. Originally, there was to be a roll-on/roll-off ferry link with Ĳmuiden, which failed to materialise. An initiative by Seamax Ferries to connect Great Yarmouth and Ijmuiden by ferry was due to start in 2008. Nor did installation of two large cranes in 2009, since removed, save plans for a container terminal, which have also been scrapped.

====Lifeboat station====

There has been a lifeboat at Great Yarmouth since at least 1802. Early boats were privately operated, until the RNLI took over in 1857. It has a lifeboat station at Riverside Road, Gorleston from where the Trent-class lifeboat &quot;Samarbeta&quot; and B class (inshore) lifeboat &quot;Seahorse IV&quot; run.

====Roadstead====
The anchorage off Yarmouth, known as &quot;Yarmouth Roads&quot;, was seen as one of East Coast&#x27;s best in the early 1800s. Their fleets gathered and set sail during the Napoleonic wars. Nowadays the roadstead is more likely to be referred to as an anchorage.

===Roads===
The town is served by the A47 and the terminating A143. Until 2017, the A12 from London terminated in Yarmouth; the route from Lowestoft was renumbered as the A47 by Highways England, as part of a wider road-improvement scheme, thereafter the A12 has terminated in Lowestoft instead of at Vauxhall roundabout. The relief road was built along the path of the old railway to carry the A12 onwards to Lowestoft and London. Roundabouts, junctions and bridges often become gridlocked at rush hour.

====Third river crossing====
Plans were advanced for a third river crossing in Great Yarmouth to link northern Gorleston with the South Denes and the Outer Harbour, avoiding the congested town centre. A public consultation took place in mid-2009 over four possible proposals but plans were stalled by lack of funding and closure of the container terminal. In 2016, additional funding of just over £1 million was pledged and a potential crossing proposal outlined for the crossing to link the A12 at Harfrey&#x27;s Roundabout to South Denes. The bridge project was approved in 2020 construction of the bascule bridge, to be named &quot;Herring Bridge&quot; began in January 2021, and was set to end in May 2023. During construction works, an unexploded German bomb from the Second World War was discovered and exploded during defusing attempts. Opening for road traffic will take place in 2024.

The North Denes Heliport, sited in the north of the town, is operated by CHC Helicopter. In 2011, the heliport&#x27;s closure was announced, with operations moving to Norwich International Airport, but this has never occurred.

<text>Burgenland (; ; ; Austro-Bavarian: &quot;Burgnland&quot;; Slovene: &quot;Gradiščanska&quot;; ) is the easternmost and least populous state of Austria. It consists of two statutory cities and seven rural districts, with a total of 171 municipalities. It is long from north to south but much narrower from west to east ( wide at Sieggraben). The region is part of the Centrope Project. The name of Burgenland was invented/coined in 1922, after its territories became part of Austria. The population of Burgenland as of 1 January 2024 is 301,951. Burgenland&#x27;s capital is Eisenstadt.

==History==
The territory of present-day Burgenland was successively part of the Roman Empire, the Hun Empire, the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths, the Italian Kingdom of Odoacer, the Kingdom of the Lombards, the Avar Khaganate, the Frankish Empire, Dominion Aba belonging to the Aba (family); Aba – Koszegi, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Habsburg monarchy, the Austrian Empire, Austria-Hungary, and lastly Austria.

Burgenland is the only Austrian province which has never been part of the Archduchy of Austria, Holy Roman Empire, German Confederation nor Austria-Hungary&#x27;s Cisleithania.

===Prehistory and antiquity===
From the 4th century BC, the area was dominated by Celts and in the 1st century AD it became part of the Roman Empire. During Roman administration, it was part of the province of Pannonia, and later part of the provinces of Pannonia Superior (in the 2nd century) and Pannonia Prima (in the 3rd century). During the late Roman Empire, Pannonia Prima province was part of larger administrative units, such are Diocese of Pannonia, Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum and Praetorian prefecture of Italy.

=== Early Germanic states ===

The first Germanic people to settle in this region were the Ostrogoths, who came to Pannonia in AD 380. The Ostrogoths became allies of Rome and were allowed to settle in Pannonia, being tasked to defend the Roman borders. In the 5th century, the area was conquered by the Huns, but after their defeat, an independent Kingdom of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia was formed. The territory of present-day Burgenland became part of the Italian Kingdom of Odoacer, but at the end of the 5th century the Ostrogothic king Theodoric conquered this kingdom and restored Ostrogothic administration in western Pannonia.

In the 6th century, the territory was included in another Germanic state, the Kingdom of the Lombards. However, the Lombards subsequently left towards Italy and the area came under the control of the Avars. For a brief period in the 7th century, the area became part of the Slavic State of Samo, however it subsequently came back under Avar control. After the Avar defeat at the end of the 8th century, the area became part of the Frankish Empire. After the Battle of Lechfeld (or Augsburg) in 955, new Germanic settlers came to the area.

=== Medieval Kingdom of Hungary ===
In 1043, Henry III and King Samuel Aba of Hungary signed a peace treaty. On 20 September 1058, Agnes of Poitou and Andrew I of Hungary met to negotiate the border. The area of Burgenland remained the western frontier of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century.

The majority of the population was Germanic, except for the Hungarian border guards of the frontier March (&quot;Gyepű&quot;). Germanic immigration from neighbouring Austria was also continuous in the Middle Ages.

===Habsburg administration===

In 1440 the territory of present-day Burgenland was controlled by the Habsburgs of Austria, and in 1463 the northern part of it (with the town of Kőszeg) became a mortgage-territory according to the peace treaty of Wiener Neustadt. In 1477 King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary had retaken the area, but in 1491 it was mortgaged again by King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary to Emperor Maximilian I. In 1647 Emperor Ferdinand II returned it to the Kingdom of Hungary (which itself was a Habsburg possession in this time).

In the 16th century, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary lost its independence and its northwestern part that was not conquered by the Ottoman Empire was included in the Habsburg Empire. This Habsburg possession was known as Royal Hungary and it included territory of present-day Burgenland and western Hungary. Royal Hungary still had counties. What is today Burgenland was in those times the Moson, Sopron and Vas counties of Hungary.
In the 16th and 17th centuries German Protestant refugees arrived in Western Royal Hungary to shelter from the religious wars of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly from the suppression of the Reformation in Austrian territories, then ruled by the staunchly Roman Catholic Habsburgs. After the Habsburg military victory against the Ottomans at the end of the 17th century, the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary was enlarged to include much of the territory of the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary. In the 17th and 18th centuries the region of Western Hungary was dominated by the wealthy Catholic landowning families, for example the Esterházys and Batthyánys. In 1867, the Habsburg Empire was transformed into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.

===Dissolution of Austria-Hungary===
According to the 1910 census 291,800 people lived on the territory of present-day Burgenland. Among them 217,072 were German-speaking (74%), 43,633 Croatian-speaking (15%) and 26,225 (9%) Hungarian-speaking. Roma people were counted according to their native language.

In December 1918, the Republic of Heinzenland was declared by Austrian politician Hans Suchard with the goal of the territory being annexed by Austria. However, it was taken over within two days by Hungary.

From March to August 1919, Burgenland was part of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.

The area had also been discussed as the site of a Czech Corridor to Yugoslavia. The decision on &quot;German West Hungary&quot; (&quot;Deutsch-Westungarn&quot;) was fixed in the treaties of Saint Germain and Trianon. Despite diplomatic efforts by Hungary, the victorious parties of World War I set the date of Burgenland&#x27;s official unification with Austria for 28 August 1921. However, on that day sharpshooters with the support of Hungary prevented the establishment of Austrian police control and customs. Lieutenant Colonel Pál Prónay and his men, the Rongyos Gárda, defended western Hungary from occupation by Austrian officials and forces of the Austrian Gendarmerie. Prónay had help from Hungarians and Croatians who did not want to live under Austrian rule, leading to the Uprising in West Hungary in 1921. Prónay occupied the whole area and created the state of Lajtabánság.

=== Ninth Austrian province ===

With the help of Italian diplomatic mediation in the Venice Protocol, the crisis was resolved in the autumn of 1921, when Hungary committed to disarm the sharpshooters by 6 November 1921. This was in exchange for a plebiscite on the unification of certain territories, including Ödenburg (Sopron), the designated capital of Burgenland, and eight surrounding villages. The vote took place from 14 to 16 December, and resulted in a clear (but doubted by Austria) vote of the people who inhabited the Sopron district to be part of Hungary. Consequently, the territory was incorporated into Austria, except for the Sopron district which was united with Hungary.

Further border adjustments were made in 1922 by the League of Nations border committee. After their decision was approved on 17 September, 10 Settlements were returned to Hungary. That included 8 settlements in the Pinka valley: Kisnarda, Nagynarda, Felsőcsatár, Alsócsatár, Németkeresztes, Magyarkeresztes, Horvátlövő and Pornóapáti, as well as Rendek (Liebing) and Rőtfalva (Rattersdorf) north of Kőszeg. The latter two was handed back to Austria in a swap agreement on 22 November in exchange for Szentpéterfa and Ólmod.

In contrast to all the other present Austrian states, which had been part of Cisleithania, Burgenland did not constitute a specific &quot;Kronland&quot;, and when it was formed it did not have its own regional political and administrative institutions such as a &quot;Landtag&quot; (representative assembly) and &quot;Statthalter&quot; (imperial governor).

On 18 July 1922, the first elections for the parliament of Burgenland took place. Various interim arrangements were required due to the changeover from Hungarian to Austrian jurisdiction. The parliament decided in 1925 on Eisenstadt as the capital of Burgenland, and moved from the various provisional estates throughout the country to the newly built &quot;Landhaus&quot; in 1929.

The first Austrian census in 1923 registered 285,600 people in Burgenland. The ethnic composition of the province had changed slightly: the percentage of German speakers increased compared to 1910 (227,869 people, 80%) while the percentage of Hungarian speakers rapidly declined (14,931 people, 5%). This was due mainly to the emigration of the Hungarian civil servants and intellectuals after the territory was ceded to Austria.

In 1923, emigration to the United States of America, which started in the late 19th century, reached its climax; in some places up to a quarter of the population went overseas.

After the Nazi German &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria, the administrative unit of Burgenland was dissolved. Northern and central Burgenland joined the district of Niederdonau (Lower Danube) while southern Burgenland joined Styria. The Jews of Burgenland were forced to emigrate in the immediate aftermath of the &quot;Anschluss&quot;.

The policy of Germanization also affected other minorities, especially Burgenland Croats and Hungarians. Minority schools were closed and the use of their native language discouraged.

In 1944, the Nazis began to build the &quot;Südostwall&quot; (South-east wall) with the help of mostly Jewish forced labor and collaborating inhabitants. Soviet troops crossed the Hungarian–Austrian border during the Vienna offensive and were only somewhat delayed by the unfinished fortifications. In the last days of the Nazi regime many executions and death marches of Jewish forced laborers took place.

=== Occupation ===

As of 1 October 1945 Burgenland was reestablished with Soviet support and given to the Soviet forces in exchange for Styria, which was in turn occupied by the United Kingdom.

Under Soviet occupation, people in Burgenland had to endure a period of serious mistreatment and an extremely slow economic progress, the latter induced by the presence of Soviet troops which discouraged investment. The Soviet occupation ended with the signing of the Austrian Independence Treaty of Vienna in 1955 by the Occupying Forces.

The brutally crushed Hungarian Revolution on 23 October 1956 resulted in a wave of Hungarian refugees on the Hungarian-Austrian border, especially at the Andau Bridge (Brücke von Andau). They were received by the inhabitants of Burgenland with overwhelming hospitality.

In 1957, the construction of the &quot;anti-Fascist Protective Barrier&quot; resulted in a complete sealing off of the area under Soviet influence from the rest of the world, turning the Hungarian-Austrian border next to Burgenland into a deadly zone of minefields and barbed wire (on the Hungarian side of the border): part of the Iron Curtain. Even during the era of the Iron Curtain, local trains between the north and south of Burgenland operated as &quot;corridor trains&quot; (&quot;Korridorzüge&quot;) – they had their doors locked as they crossed through Hungarian territory.

Between 1965 and 1971, the minefields were cleared because people were often harmed by them, even on the Austrian side of the border.

=== Recent history ===

Despite Burgenland (especially the area around the Neusiedler See) always producing excellent wine, some vintners in Burgenland added illegal substances to their wine in the mid-1980s. When this was revealed, Austria&#x27;s wine exports dwindled dramatically. After recovering from the scandal, vintners in Austria, and not only in Burgenland, started focusing on quality and mostly stopped producing low-quality wine.

On 27 July 1989, the foreign ministers of Austria and Hungary, Alois Mock and Gyula Horn, cut the Iron Curtain in the village of Klingenbach in a symbolic act with far-reaching consequences. At the same time, the border crossing at Nickelsdorf (Austria) / Hegyeshalom (Hungary) was opened by the Hungarian border patrol and this enabled the escape of East Germans. Directly behind the wires special medic troops of the Austrian Red Cross awaited them and provided first assistance. Thousands of East Germans fled to the West in this way. Again, the inhabitants of Burgenland received them with great hospitality. Later, this was often referred to as the beginning of German reunification.

After 1990 Burgenland regained its traditional role as a bridge between the western and eastern parts of Central Europe. In 2003 it joined an Interreg project Centrope. Cross-border links were further strengthened when Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic joined the European Union in 2004. All three countries became part of the Schengen zone in late 2007, and border controls ceased to exist in the region.

In 2021, Burgenland grew by about 6,000 m2. This was due to the change of flood protection measures along the river Lafnitz, which forms part of the border between Burgenland and Styria, in the late 1970s. As the course of the river changed somewhat along with the change of the flood protection measures, some areas belonging to Styria ended up to the east of the river and some areas belonging to Burgenland ended up to the west of the river. In 2010, it was decided by legislators together with the local councils that the areas to the west of the river would be part of Styria and the areas to the east of the river would be part of Burgenland, reflecting the perceptions and attitudes of the population. This decision was put into law in 2021.

== Geography ==

Burgenland is the third-smallest of Austria&#x27;s nine states at . The province&#x27;s highest point is exactly on the border with Hungary, on the Geschriebenstein, above sea level. The highest point entirely within Burgenland is 879 metres above sea level; the lowest point (which is also the lowest point of Austria) at , is in the municipal area of Apetlon.

Burgenland borders the Austrian states of Styria to the southwest and Lower Austria to the northwest. To the east it borders Hungary (Vas County and Győr-Moson-Sopron County). In the extreme north and south there are short borders with Slovakia (Bratislava Region) and Slovenia (Mura Statistical Region) respectively.

Burgenland and Hungary share the Neusiedler See (Hungarian: &quot;Fertő-tó&quot;), a lake known for its reeds and shallowness, as well as its mild climate throughout the year. The Neusiedler See is Austria&#x27;s largest lake. It is a tourist attraction, bringing ornithologists, sailors, and wind and kite surfers into the region north of the lake.

==Politics==
Burgenland&#x27;s provincial assembly &quot;(Landtag)&quot; has 36 seats. At the election held on 26 January 2020, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) won an absolute majority of 19 seats, the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) won 11 seats, the Freedom Party (FPÖ) won 4 seats and the Green Party won 2 seats. The voting age for regional elections in Burgenland was reduced to 16 years in 2003.

== Economy ==
The province&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was €9 billion in 2018, accounting for 2.3% of Austria&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €27,300 or 90% of the EU27 average in the same year. Burgenland is the province with the lowest GDP per capita in Austria.

==Administrative divisions==
Burgenland consists of nine districts, two statutory cities and seven rural districts. From north to south:
=== Statutory cities ===
These combine the attributes of district and city.
* Eisenstadt
*Rust

===Rural districts===
* Neusiedl am See (administrative center Neusiedl am See)
* Eisenstadt-Umgebung (Eisenstadt)
* Mattersburg (Mattersburg)
* Oberpullendorf (Oberpullendorf)
* Oberwart (Oberwart)
* Güssing (Güssing)
* Jennersdorf (Jennersdorf)

==Demographics==

=== Population development ===
The historical population is given in the following chart:
=== Minorities ===
Burgenland has notable Croatian (130,000) and Hungarian (5,000–15,000) populations. Croats number 30,000.

==== Croats ====

The Croats arrived after the devastating Ottoman war in 1532, when the Ottoman army destroyed some settlements in their ethnic territory. The emigration in great haste of the remaining Catholic population of western Slavonia into Burgenland was – as far as possible – organized by estate owners. The archives of the Sabor (the Croatian parliament) from this period contain numerous references to such resettlements. As reported in the spring of 1538 by the Ban of Croatia, Petar Keglević, who himself owned large estates in western Slavonia, that the country&#x27;s population at the Ottoman border was preparing to emigrate. Their resettlement by estate owners was finished only in 1584. They have preserved their strong Catholic faith and their language until today, and in the 19th century their national identity grew stronger because of the influence of the National Revival in Croatia. Between 1918 and 1921 Croats opposed the planned annexation of West-Hungary to Austria, and in 1923 seven Croatian villages voted for a return to Hungary. The Croatian Cultural Association of Burgenland was established in 1934. In the Nazi era (1938–45) the Croatian language was officially prohibited, and the state pursued an aggressive policy of Germanization. The Austrian State Treaty of 1955 guaranteed minority rights for every native ethnic minority in Austria but Croats had to fight for the use of their language in schools and offices even in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2000 51 new bilingual village name signs were erected in Burgenland (47 Croatian and 4 Hungarian).

The Burgenland Croatian language is a 16th-century dialect which is different from standard Croatian. In minority schools and media the local dialect is used, and it has had a written form since the 17th century (the Gospel was first translated to this dialect in 1711). Today the language is endangered by assimilation, according to the UNESCO&#x27;s Red Book of Endangered Languages. The Croats of Burgenland belong to the same group as their relatives on the other side of the modern-day border with Hungary.

==== Hungarians ====
Hungarians live in the villages of Oberwart/Felsőőr, Unterwart/Alsóőr and Siget in der Wart/Őrisziget. The three villages together are called Upper Őrség (Hun: &quot;Felső-Őrség&quot;, German: &quot;Wart&quot;), and they have formed a language island since the 11th century. The other old Hungarian language island in Oberpullendorf/Felsőpulya has almost disappeared today. The Hungarians of Burgenland were &quot;őrök&quot;, i.e. guards of the western frontier, and their special dialect is similar to the Székelys in Transylvania. Their cultural centre is Oberwart/Felsőőr. Another distinct Hungarian group were the indentured agricultural workers living on the huge estates north of Neusiedler See. They arrived mainly from the Rábaköz region. After the dissolution of the manors in the mid-20th century this group ceased to exist.

==== Roma and Jews ====
In addition to Germans, Croats and Hungarians, Burgenland used to have substantial Roma and Jewish populations, but these were wiped out by the Nazi regime. Before their deportation during 1938, the traditionally very religious Burgenland Jews were concentrated in the famous &quot;Seven Communities&quot; (Siebengemeinden/Sheva kehillot) in Eisenstadt, Mattersburg, Kittsee, Frauenkirchen, Kobersdorf, Lackenbach and Deutschkreutz, where they formed a substantial part of the population: e.g. in Lackenbach, 62% of the population was Jewish as of 1869. After the war, Jews from Burgenland founded the Jerusalem haredi neighbourhood of Kiryat Mattersdorf, reminding of the original name of Mattersburg, once a centre of a famous yeshiva.

According to 2021 figures of Statistics Austria, Burgenland&#x27;s population is mostly Christian (80.3%), with the highest proportion of Protestants in Austria (11.4%). 65.5% of the population are Roman Catholic, and further 3.4% are adherents of other Christian denominations (mostly Orthodox Christians). Islam is practiced by 2.2%, while 0.7% profess another religion. 16.8% of Burgenland&#x27;s inhabitants profess no affiliation with any religion or denomination.

==Names==
In Slovak, Burgendland is known as &quot;Hradsko&quot;; in Croatian as &quot;Gradišće&quot;; in Hungarian as &quot;Őrvidék&quot;, &quot;Felsőőrvidék&quot; or &quot;Várvidék&quot;; in Slovene as &quot;Gradiščanska&quot;.

As the region was not a territorial entity before 1921, it never had an official name. Until the end of World War I the German-speaking western borderland of the Kingdom of Hungary was sometimes unofficially called &quot;Deutsch-Westungarn&quot; (German West Hungary). The historical region included the border city of Sopron in Hungary (known as Ödenburg in German).

The name &quot;Vierburgenland&quot; (Land of Four Castles) was created in 1919 by Odo Rötig, a Viennese resident of Sopron. It was derived from the four &quot;vármegye&quot; of the Kingdom of Hungary (in German &quot;Komitaten&quot;, &#x27;counties&#x27;) known in Hungarian as Pozsony, Moson, Sopron and Vas, or in German as Pressburg, Wieselburg, Ödenburg and Eisenburg. After the town of Pozsony/Pressburg (Bratislava) was assigned to Czechoslovakia, the number &quot;vier&quot; was to be changed to &quot;drei&quot; (=three), but after it became clear that none of the &quot;Burgen&quot; would be part of the Burgenland, the number was dropped completely but the name Burgenland was kept because it was deemed to be appropriate for a region with so many old frontier castles. The &quot;Burgenland&quot; name was adopted by the first provincial Landtag in 1922.

In Hungarian the German name is generally accepted but there are three modern alternatives used by minor groups. The Hungarian translation of the German name, &quot;Várvidék&quot;, was invented by László Juhász, an expert of the region in the 1970s, and it is becoming increasingly popular especially in tourist publications. The other two names &quot;Őrvidék&quot; and &quot;Felső-Őrvidék&quot; are derived from the name of the most important old Magyar language island, the Felső-Őrség. This microregion is around the town Felsőőr/Oberwart, so these new names are a bit misleading; however they are sometimes used.

The Croatian and Slovenian names &quot; and &quot; are calques of the German name. The village of Jennersdorf is no more than 5 kilometers from the Slovenian and Hungarian borders (see the United Slovenia movement).

Alternatively, the Serbs, Czechs and Slovaks call the western shores of the Neusiedler See, the lake adjoining the town of Rust, Luzic or Lusic. However, the descendants of Luzic Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats, Czechs and Slovaks were eventually assimilated into the ethnic German or Hungarian cultures over four centuries.

The province has a long history of Slavic, as well Austrian-German and Hungarian-Magyar settlement. The province&#x27;s easternmost portion (the shores of the Neusiedler See) carried its own topographical term &quot;Seewinkel&quot; in Austrian-German. This is the area least influenced by Austrian-German since the Hungarian and Slovak borders are less than 10 kilometers away.

==Symbols==
Heraldic description of the coat-of-arms of Burgenland:

:Or, standing upon a rock sable, an eagle regardant, wings displayed gules, langued of the same, crowned and armed of the first, on his breast an escutcheon paly of four, of the third and white fur, fimbriated of the field, and in dexter and sinister cantons two crosslets paty sable.

The arms were introduced in 1922 after the new province was created. They were composed from the arms of the two most important medieval noble families of the region, the counts of Nagymarton and Fraknó (Mattersdorf-Forchtenstein, eagle on the rock) and the counts of Németújvár (Güssing, three bars of red and white fur).

The flag of the province shows two stripes of red and gold, the colours of the coat-of-arms. It was officially confirmed in 1971.

==Culture==

The cultural offerings are diverse and especially in the summer famous for the Seefestspiele Mörbisch and the Nova Rock Festival with numerous international rockbands.

The permanent exhibition at Forchtenstein Castle shows an impressive collection of the dukes of Esterházy, at whose court at Esterházy Palace worked the world-famous musician Joseph Haydn, who composed from the Burgenland Croatian folk-song &quot;V jutro rano se ja stanem&quot; (&quot;In the morning I rise up early&quot;) the melody of &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot; (&quot;God save Franz the Emperor&quot;), which became the melody of today&#x27;s national anthem of Germany. There are also cultural events organized by the minorities such as Croatian or Hungarian folk evenings.

The dialect spoken in Burgenland is called Hianzisch.

People from Burgenland tend to be the butt of a joke cycle by people from other regions of Austria, similar to the German East Frisian jokes. These jokes portray people from Burgenland as dumb or slow on the uptake.

<text>The State is an American newspaper published in Columbia, South Carolina. The newspaper is owned and distributed by The McClatchy Company in the Midlands region of the state. It is by circulation, the second-largest newspaper in South Carolina after &quot;The Post and Courier&quot;.

==History==
The newspaper, first published on February 18, 1891. was founded by two brothers, N.G. Gonzales and A.E. Gonzales. In 1903, N. G. Gonzales was fatally shot by lieutenant governor James H. Tillman, who was later acquitted of murder charges.

In 1945, &quot;The State&quot; bought its rival, the &quot;Columbia Record&quot;, with the parent company becoming &quot;The State-Record Company.&quot; The paper&#x27;s owners diversified in 1971 by founding &quot;State Telecasting Company&quot;. State Telecasting purchased two television stations in New Mexico and Texas, along with a station in South Carolina. KCBD in Lubbock, Texas, and its full-time satellite KSWS in Roswell, New Mexico, were acquired in 1971 for $6 million from the Joe Bryant estate. WUSN-TV in nearby Charleston, South Carolina, was acquired and the call letters changed to WCBD-TV to conform with those of KCBD. The paper remained in the hands of the Gonzales family until 1986, when Knight Ridder purchased the State-Record Company and six subsidiaries (including the &quot;Sun Herald&quot; and &quot;The Sun News&quot;) for $311 million. In 2006, Knight Ridder was purchased by McClatchy.

In 2020, McClatchy filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by hedge fund, Chatham Asset Management for $312 million.

On April 22, 2024 &quot;The State&quot; started printing Sunday, Wednesday and Friday only and delivering through the mail.

== Background ==
Its news staff was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in general news reporting for its Hurricane Hugo coverage in 1989. Its cartoonist, Robert Ariail, was a Pulitzer finalist in 1995 and 2000. Reporter Gina Smith and current projects editor broke the Mark Sanford scandal story on June 24, 2009, when she interviewed Sanford at Atlanta Hartsfield Airport as he returned from Argentina.

According to the newspaper&#x27;s Web site, it has 440 full-time employees and another 31 who work part-time, not including an on-premises &quot;McClatchy Customer Care Center for subscriber assistance.&quot; &quot;The State&quot; has a building completed in 1988, south of downtown.

In 2017, the McClatchy Company listed the State&#x27;s Columbia headquarters building for sale for $17,000,000.

<doc id="98943" wikidata="Q791285" url="?curid=98943" title="Avon Products">
<text>Avon Products, Inc. ( ) is an Anglo-American multinational company selling cosmetics, skin care, perfume, and personal care products. It is a multi-level marketing company based in London. In 2020, Avon had annual sales of $9.1 billion worldwide.

It is the fourteenth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest multi-level marketing company in the world (after Amway). The company&#x27;s CEO is Kristof Neirynck who was appointed to the position in November 2023.

In May 2019, the Brazilian multinational company Natura &amp; Co announced its intent to acquire Avon; the deal closed in January 2020. Following the merger, existing Natura shareholders held 73% of the combined company, Natura Holding S.A., with former Avon shareholders owning 27%. At merger completion, Avon became a privately held company, common stock was removed from the NYSE trading.

==History==
Avon&#x27;s founder, David H. McConnell, initially sold books as a door-to-door salesman to New York homes. In September 1886, he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892. His business partner suggested calling it the &quot;California Perfume Company.&quot; His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.
In May 1894, Alexander D. Henderson joined the company, became vice-president and treasurer, and helped shape its policies and assist in its growth. In 1897 they built a laboratory in Suffern, New York. On May 3, 1909, the California Perfume Company corporate office moved to 31 Park Place, New York. On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Incorporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey. On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials. In 1939, the California Perfume Company changed its name to Avon.

===International expansion===

Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company&#x27;s largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998, which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.

88% of Avon&#x27;s 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million. In May 2012, perfume company Coty offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon&#x27;s stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer, earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating &quot;At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty&#x27;s indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon&#x27;s shareholders.&quot;

In March 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of its North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.

In January 2020, Natura &amp; Co closed the acquisition of Avon Products, Inc. The Natura &amp; Co group also includes Natura, Aesop, and The Body Shop, and with the acquisition of Avon has created the world&#x27;s fourth-largest pure-play beauty company.

===Recent history===

In 2014, Avon&#x27;s global sales had fallen for five straight years, and its North American revenues fell 18% that year.

In 2016, Avon completed the separation of its United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico business as &quot;New Avon LLC&quot;, which also trades with the &quot;Avon&quot; name. As part of a three-year plan, the global Avon Products relocated its headquarters to London in the United Kingdom. In August 2019, New Avon LLC, the privately held North American company that split from Avon Products, Inc. (Avon Worldwide) in 2016 entered into a definitive agreement with South Korean consumer goods giant LG Household &amp; Health Care, Ltd., which purchased the direct-selling cosmetics business for $125 million in cash. 

Jan Zijderveld was appointed the company&#x27;s CEO in February 2018. The former CEO, Sherilyn S. McCoy, stayed on as an adviser to the Board and to Zijderveld through March 31, 2018.

In January 2021, New Avon Company announced its corporate name change to The Avon Company.

In 2019, the Brazilian beauty company Natura agreed to buy Avon Products for more than $2bn via a share swap, creating the world&#x27;s fourth-largest beauty company. Under the deal&#x27;s terms, Natura will hold 76% of the combined business with over $10 billion in annual revenue.

In November 2023, Avon announced it would open stores in the United Kingdom for the first time in the company&#x27;s history, augmenting its already existing network of 63 stores in Turkey. However, in August 2024, Avon Products filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in an effort to settle its talc-based lawsuits.

==Business model and marketing==

Avon uses both door-to-door salespeople (&quot;Avon ladies&quot;, as well as &quot;Avon men&quot;) and brochures to advertise its products. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon recruits sales representatives who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories, and clothing.

Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon Color (including Power Stay, Make Up + Care, and Ultra Colour range), Imari, Far Away, Avon Eve, Today Tomorrow Always, Black Suede, Avon Fashions, Anew, Clearskin, Naturals, Avon Care, Avon Senses, Skin So Soft among others. According to the U.S. government, Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.

Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.

==Controversies==
===American corruption charges===
Beginning in 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon were investigated for possible violations of the law, including bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Avon began a probe of its China division after an internal whistleblower alleged bribery in June 2008. At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010, and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Avon spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011. The final tally was about $500 million.

The Times reported that Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose. On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.

In 2014, Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.

===Animal testing===
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, it would no longer participate in animal testing. Avon has since claimed to be working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include &quot;in vitro&quot; testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.

Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm or growth products. Despite laws that require animal testing in some countries, Avon chooses to distribute its products in those jurisdictions. Laws in various countries require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell certain products in that country. Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.

In 2019, Avon ended all regulatory-required animal testing, making it the first global beauty company selling in China to stop all animal testing of ingredients and products across all its brands by developing new ways to deliver products that do not require animal testing, such as reformulating products. PETA has since announced that it has added Avon Products Inc. to their list of companies &quot;Working for Regulatory Change&quot;.

== Withdrawal from major markets ==
In October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in France at the end of that month. Its French employees accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the company&#x27;s publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of &quot;open and candid communication.&quot; As of January 2014, Avon France was in receivership.

This was followed by an announcement via Facebook on February 15, 2018, that Avon Australia and New Zealand would close by the end of the year. This decision resulted in the loss of 220 jobs and 21,400 sales representatives. The company has attracted criticism for poor communication with its customers and employees.

Avon is still active in Russia and is recruiting more people and continuing to manufacture products as of January 2024.

<text>The Canadian province of Nova Scotia has a historical system of 18 counties that originally had appointed court systems for local administration before the establishment of elected local governments in 1879. The historical counties continue as census divisions used by Statistics Canada in administering the Canadian census.

== History ==
Before the establishment of rural municipalities in the form of county municipalities and district municipalities in 1879, local government in the historical counties was administered by appointed courts of sessions including justices appointed by the Crown with support from local proprietors selected to grand juries. These courts of sessions met &quot;in the counties to hear cases, make regulations, authorize assessments, and appoint local officers.&quot; On April 17, 1879, the original non-elected courts of sessions were abolished in favour of elected councils when &quot;The County Incorporation Act&quot; came into force, which stated
 As a result, 12 county municipalities were established, while the remaining 6 counties, which were previously divided into districts for court sessional purposes, were established as district municipalities. Today, 9 of the original 12 remain incorporated as county municipalities, with 3 eventually becoming regional municipalities in 1995 and 1996, while Statistics Canada uses all 18 historical counties as census divisions for statistical purposes in the Canadian census. County municipalities and district municipalities provide local government to the residents of the historical counties living outside of incorporated towns and regional municipalities.

<doc id="98954" wikidata="Q441537" url="?curid=98954" title="Frances Wright">
<text>Frances Wright (September 6, 1795 – December 13, 1852), widely known as Fanny Wright, was a Scottish-born lecturer, writer, freethinker, feminist, utopian socialist, abolitionist, social reformer, and Epicurean philosopher, who became a US citizen in 1825. The same year, she founded the Nashoba Commune in Tennessee as a utopian community to demonstrate how to prepare slaves for eventual emancipation, but the project lasted only five years.

In the late 1820s, Wright was among the first women in America to speak publicly about politics and social reform before gatherings of both men and women. She advocated universal education, the emancipation of slaves, birth control, equal rights, sexual freedom, legal rights for married women, and liberal divorce laws. Wright was also vocal in her opposition to organized religion and capital punishment. The clergy and the press harshly criticized Wright&#x27;s radical views. Her public lectures in the United States led to the establishment of Fanny Wright societies. Her association with the Working Men&#x27;s Party, organized in New York City in 1829, became so intense that its opponents called the party&#x27;s slate of candidates the Fanny Wright ticket.

Wright was also a writer. Her &quot;Views of Society and Manners in America&quot; (1821), a travel memoir that included observations on the political and social institutions of the United States, was very successful. She also authored &quot;A Plan for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in the United States Without Danger of Loss to the Citizens of the South&quot; (1825). In addition, Wright co-edited &quot;The New Harmony and Nashoba Gazette&quot; with Robert Dale Owen in New Harmony, Indiana, as well as other periodicals.

==Early life and education==

Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Wright was born at 136 Nethergate in Dundee, Scotland, on September 6, 1795, to Camilla Campbell and her husband James Wright. Their house was then a newly built house by the town architect, Samuel Bell on the recently widened Nethergate, close to Dundee harbour.

Her father was a wealthy linen manufacturer, a designer of Dundee trade tokens, and a political radical. He corresponded with Adam Smith and was sympathetic to the American patriots and French republicans, including Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Thomas Paine. Frances, or &quot;Fanny&quot; as she was called since childhood, was the second eldest of the family&#x27;s three children. Her siblings included an older brother, who died when Frances was still young, and a sister named Camilla. Wright&#x27;s mother also died young, and her father died in 1798, when Frances was about the age of two. With support from a substantial inheritance, the orphaned Wright sisters were raised in England by members of the Campbell family, who were their mother&#x27;s relatives.

A maternal aunt became Wright&#x27;s guardian and taught her ideas founded on the philosophy of the French materialists. In 1813, when Wright was sixteen, she returned to Scotland to live with her great-uncle, James Mylne, a philosophy professor at Glasgow College. Wright was interested in the works of Greek philosophers, especially Epicurus, who was the subject of her first book, &quot;A Few Days in Athens&quot; (1822), which she had written by the age of eighteen. Wright also studied history and became interested in the United States&#x27; democratic form of government.

==First visits to the United States and France==
Twenty-three-year-old Wright and her younger sister Camilla made their first trip to the United States in 1818. The sisters toured the country for two years before returning to England. While Wright was visiting New York City, &quot;Altorf&quot;, her play about the struggle for Swiss independence from Austria, was anonymously produced and performed beginning on February 19, 1819. However, it closed after three performances. For its Philadelphia premiere on January 5, 1820, an advertisement noted that it was &quot;performed in New York last season with distinguished success.&quot;

Soon after her return to England in 1820, Wright published &quot;Views of Society and Manners in America&quot; (1821). The book&#x27;s publication was a major turning point in her life. It brought her an invitation from Jeremy Bentham to join his circle of acquaintances, which included economist James Mill, politician Francis Plore, and author George Grote, among others. The group&#x27;s opposition to religious clergy influenced Wright&#x27;s own emerging philosophy.

In 1821, Wright traveled to France at the invitation of the Marquis de Lafayette and met with him in Paris. Despite the differences in their ages, the two became friends. At one point, Wright encouraged him to adopt her and her sister. Wright&#x27;s request strained the relationship with General Lafayette&#x27;s family, and no adoption occurred. Wright&#x27;s friendship with the general continued after relations with his family were repaired. She also returned to Lafayette&#x27;s home in France for a six-month visit in 1827 to work on a biography of him.

==Second visit to the United States==

In 1824, Wright and her sister returned to the United States to follow the Marquis de Lafayette and his entourage during much of his farewell tour of the United States. Wright joined Lafayette for a two-week stay at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s plantation in Virginia. In addition to Jefferson, Lafayette also introduced Wright to Presidents James Madison and John Quincy Adams, as well as General Andrew Jackson.

In February 1825, when Lafayette headed south, Wright traveled northwest to visit Harmonie, George Rapp&#x27;s utopian community in Butler County, Pennsylvania. She also visited the Rappite colony established in Indiana, which was also named Harmonie. At that time, the Indiana community was in a period of transition. It had recently been sold to Welsh industrialist and social reformer Robert Owen, who renamed his utopian community New Harmony. Wright&#x27;s visits to these utopian communities inspired her to form an experimental community, which she established in Tennessee. After leaving Indiana, she traveled along the Mississippi River with her new friend Emily Ronalds to rejoin Lafayette&#x27;s group in New Orleans in April 1825. When Lafayette returned to France, Wright decided to remain in the United States, where she continued her work as a social reformer. It was also in 1825 that Wright became a U.S. citizen.

==Views==
Wright believed in many foundational tenets of feminism, including equality in education between the sexes. She opposed organized religion, marriage, and capitalism. Educational opportunities were a particular interest. Along with Robert Owen, Wright demanded that the government offer free public education for all children after the age of twelve or eighteen months of age in federal government-supported
boarding schools.

Wright was a vocal advocate of birth control, equal rights, sexual freedom, legal rights for married women, liberal divorce laws, the emancipation of slaves, and the controversial idea of interracial marriages. She tried to demonstrate through her experiment project in Tennessee what the utopian socialist Charles Fourier had said in France, &quot;that the progress of civilization depended on the progress of women.&quot; Wright&#x27;s opposition to slavery contrasted with the views of many other Democrats of the era, especially those of the South. Her activism on behalf of working men also distanced her from the leading abolitionists of the day.

==Career==
===Early career===
Wright&#x27;s early writing career included her book, &quot;Few Days in Athens&quot; (1822), which was a defense of the philosophy of Epicurus, written before the age of eighteen. Wright&#x27;s &quot;Views of Society and Manners in America&quot; (1821), a memoir of her first visit to the United States, enthusiastically supported the country&#x27;s democratic institutions. This book provides early descriptions of American life that preceded later works such as Alexis De Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835 and 1840) and Harriet Martineau&#x27;s &quot;Society in America&quot; (1837). Wright&#x27;s book is also an example of an early nineteenth-century humanitarian perspective of the new democratic world. Historian Helen Elliott also pointed out that Wright&#x27;s travelogue was &quot;translated into several languages and widely read by liberals and reformers&quot; in Great Britain, the United States, and Europe.

===Nashoba experiment===
In early 1825, after spending time at former President Jefferson&#x27;s home in Virginia and Robert Owen&#x27;s utopian settlement at New Harmony, Wright began developing her plans for an experimental farming community. By the summer of 1825, she sought advice from Lafayette and Jefferson, among others, to implement her ideas. Owen and Lafayette later became members of her project&#x27;s board of trustees; however, Jefferson declined to participate. Wright also published &quot;A Plan for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in the United States Without Danger of Loss to the Citizens of the South&quot; (1825), a tract that she hoped would persuade the U.S. Congress to set aside federal land for promoting emancipation. To demonstrate how enslaved people could be emancipated without their owners losing money, Wright established a model farming community in Tennessee where enslaved people could work to earn money to purchase their own freedom and receive an education.

Taking inspiration from the New Harmony community in Indiana, Wright traveled to Tennessee in the fall of 1825 and bought about of land along Wolf River about thirteen miles from Memphis. Wright founded a community at this wilderness site, which she named Nashoba. Emily Ronalds contributed £300 to the scheme. To demonstrate that her idea was a viable way to abolish slavery, Wright purchased about thirty enslaved people, nearly half of them children, to live in the experimental community. Her plan was for the enslaved people to acquire their freedom through labor on the property gradually. Wright also planned to eventually colonize the newly emancipated slaves to areas outside the United States.

In addition to building cabins and farm buildings, Wright planned to establish a school for black students. However, many abolitionists criticized her idea of gradual emancipation and educational training for formerly enslaved people. Wright joined in the early efforts to clear land and build log cabins for its inhabitants, which included blacks and whites. Nashoba was, however, plagued with difficulties from the start. It was built on mosquito-infested land conducive to malaria and failed to produce good harvests. Wright contracted malaria in the summer of 1826 and had to leave the property to recover her health in New Harmony, Indiana, and visits to France and England. While she was absent from Nashoba, the community declined. Its interim managers began instituting a policy of harsher punishments toward the black workers. A scandal also erupted over the community&#x27;s tolerance of &quot;free love&quot; amid publicized accounts of an interracial relationship between James Richardson, a white supervisor of the community, and Josephone Lalotte, the mulatto daughter of a freed African American woman slave who had brought her family to live at Nashoba. Wright returned to Nashoba in 1828 with her friend, Frances Trollope, who spent ten days in the community and found it in disarray and on the verge of financial collapse. Trollope&#x27;s published descriptions of the area criticized its poor weather, lack of scenic beauty, and Nashoba&#x27;s remoteness and desolation.

In 1828, when Nashoba was rapidly declining, the &quot;New-Harmony Gazette&quot; published Wright&#x27;s explanation and defense of the commune and her views on the principles of &quot;human liberty and equality.&quot; In January 1830, Wright chartered a ship and accompanied the community&#x27;s thirty slaves to Haiti, which had achieved independence in 1804, so they could live as free men and women. The failed experiment cost Wright about US$16,000. Germantown, Tennessee, a present-day suburb of Memphis, was established on the land where Nashoba once stood.

===Newspaper editor===
After Wright&#x27;s failure at Nashoba in the late 1820s, she returned to New Harmony, Indiana, where she became the coeditor of &quot;The New Harmony and Nashoba Gazette&quot; (later renamed the &quot;Free Enquirer&quot;) with Robert Dale Owen, the eldest son of Robert Owen, the Owenite community&#x27;s founder. In 1829, Wright and Robert Dale Owen moved to New York City, where they continued to edit and publish the &quot;Free Enquirer&quot;. Wright was also editor of &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (later titled &quot;New York Sentinel and Working Man&#x27;s Advocate&quot;).

===Political and social activist===

Beginning in the late 1820s and early 1830s, Wright spoke publicly in favor of abolition and lectured to support women&#x27;s suffrage. She also campaigned for reforms to marriage and property laws. While residing in New York City, she purchased a former church in the Bowery area and converted it into a &quot;Hall of Science&quot; as a lecture hall. From 1833 to 1836, her lectures on slavery and other social institutions attracted large and enthusiastic audiences of men and women in the eastern United States and the Midwest, leading to the establishment of what were called Fanny Wright societies. Although her lecture tours extended to the principal cities of the United States, the enunciation of her views and publication of a collection of her speeches in her book, &quot;Course of Popular Lectures&quot; (1829 and 1836), met with opposition.

The clergy and the press were critical of Wright and her opinions on religion and social reform. The &quot;New York American&quot;, for example, called Wright &quot;a female monster&quot; because of her controversial views, but she was undeterred. As Wright&#x27;s philosophy became even more radical, she left the Democratic Party to join the Working Men&#x27;s Party, organized in New York City in 1829. Her influence on the Working Men&#x27;s Party was so strong that its opponents called its slate of candidates the Fanny Wright ticket. Wright was also an activist in the American Popular Health Movement in the 1830s and advocated for women being involved in health and medicine.

==Personal life==
Wright married French physician Guillaume D&#x27;Arusmont in Paris, France, on July 22, 1831. Wright met him at New Harmony, Indiana, where he was once a teacher. D&#x27;Arusmont accompanied her to Haiti in 1830, serving as her business manager. Wright&#x27;s and D&#x27;Arusmont&#x27;s daughter, Francès-Sylva Phiquepal D&#x27;Arusmont, was born on April 14, 1832.

==Later years==
Wright, her husband, and their daughter traveled to the United States in 1835 and made several subsequent trips between the United States and Europe. Wright eventually settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she bought a home in 1844 and attempted to resume her career as a lecturer. Wright continued to travel the lecture circuit, but her appearances and views on social reform issues were not always welcome. She also became a supporter of President Andrew Jackson. After the mid-term political campaign of 1838, Wright suffered from various health problems. She published her final book, &quot;England, the Civilizer&quot; in 1848.

Wright divorced D&#x27;Arusmont in 1850. She also fought a lengthy legal battle to retain custody of their daughter and control of her own personal wealth. The legal proceedings remained unsettled at the time of Wright&#x27;s death. Wright spent her last years in quiet retirement at Cincinnati, estranged from her daughter, Francès-Sylva D&#x27;Arusmont.

==Death and legacy==
Wright died on December 13, 1852, in Cincinnati, Ohio, from complications of a broken hip after falling on ice outside her home. She is buried at the Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati. Her daughter, Francès-Sylva D&#x27;Arusmont, inherited the majority of Wright&#x27;s wealth and property.

Wright, an early women&#x27;s rights advocate and a social reformer, was the first woman to deliver public lectures to men and women on political social reform issues in the United States in the late 1820s. Her views on slavery, theology, and women&#x27;s rights were considered radical for that time, and attracted harsh criticism from the press and clergy.

The first volume of &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;, published in 1881, states, “THESE VOLUMES ARE AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED TO THE Memory of Mary Wollstonecraft, Frances Wright, Lucretia Mott, Harriet Martineau, Lydia Maria Child, Margaret Fuller, Sarah and Angelina Grimké, Josephine S. Griffing, Martha C. Wright, Harriot K. Hunt, M.D., Mariana W. Johnson, Alice and Phebe Carey, Ann Preston, M.D., Lydia Mott, Eliza W. Farnham, Lydia F. Fowler, M.D., Paulina Wright Davis, Whose Earnest Lives and Fearless Words, in Demanding Political Rights for Women, have been, in the Preparation of these Pages, a Constant Inspiration TO The Editors”.

<doc id="98955" wikidata="Q478666" url="?curid=98955" title="Wroxham">
<text>Wroxham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. The civil parish of Wroxham has an area of 6.21 square kilometres, and in 2001, had a population of 1,532 in 666 households. A reduced population of 1,502 in 653 households was noted in the 2011 Census. The village is situated within the Norfolk Broads on the south side of a loop in the middle reaches of the River Bure. It lies in an elevated position above the Bure, between Belaugh Broad to the west, and Wroxham Broad to the east and south east. Wroxham is some eight miles north-east of Norwich, to which it is linked by the A1151 road. The village and broad lie in an area of fairly intensive agriculture, with areas of wet woodland adjoining the broad and river. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of Broadland although the river, broad and their immediate environs fall within the executive area of the Broads Authority. On the northern side of the Bure is the village of Hoveton, often confused with Wroxham.

The village&#x27;s name origin is uncertain; it is believed to mean &#x27;wrocc&#x27;s homestead/village&#x27; or &#x27;buzzard homestead/village&#x27;.

==Wroxham Bridge==

Wroxham Bridge was rebuilt with brick and stone in 1619, replacing a bridge built in 1576, which itself replaced an earlier, probably wooden, structure. It is considered to be the second most difficult on the Broads to navigate (after Potter Heigham) and a pilot station sits on the Hoveton side of the river to assist boaters for a fee: £12 each way per boat.

==The Broad==
Wroxham Broad lies about one mile downstream from Wroxham Bridge. The broad has an area of 34.4 hectares and a mean depth of 1.3 metres. It lies to the west of the Bure, with two navigable openings between river and broad. The broad is popular for sailing and is the home of the Norfolk Broads Yacht Club. It is also an important habitat for broadland flora and fauna. Between 2000 and 2005, the island between the two channels linking Wroxham Broad to the Bure underwent restoration to stop erosion and improve the island&#x27;s ecology, which had become degraded. The project was a joint initiative involving the Broads Authority, Norfolk Broads Yacht Club, and the local landowner, Trafford Estates. Scrub was cleared and a stretch of piling installed, allowing sedge, reed, and rush to grow back. By 2005 it was reported that more birds, including kingfishers, were nesting on the island and the Cetti&#x27;s warbler was often spotted. Greater numbers of ducks, including pochard and tufted duck, now wintered nearby and there was a greater profusion of wild flowers and marsh flora including orchids. During the course of the work in 2004, volunteers came across an unexploded Second World War hand grenade in the dredgings, which was exploded by an army bomb disposal team.

==Capital of the Broads==
Wroxham is often called the &quot;Capital of the Broads&quot;, an accolade that may, with some merit, be challenged by Hoveton, where the majority of local businesses and boatyards are situated; it has been the primary centre on the Broads for boating holidays and excursions from the late nineteenth century, when expansion of the rail network had made access to the area easier. 

The East Norfolk Railway arrived in Wroxham and Hoveton between 1874 and 1876. John Loynes, regarded as the father of the Broadland holiday business, started the first boat hire firm on the Broads of Wroxham where he moved the business he had started in Norwich in 1878.

==Wroxham and Hoveton==
Both Wroxham and Hoveton have several boat building and pleasure craft hire yards. Other local industries include the canning of soft fruits. Wroxham village had at one time, for much of the 20th century, its own public house (The Castle, in Norwich Road), four village shops (one in Castle Street and three in Norwich Road), and a primary school (in Church Lane), all now closed. A public library was built near Bridge Broad, a small broad near Wroxham Bridge, in the 1960s.

Wroxham has almost merged with Hoveton, with each village growing on either bank of the river, and much of the area&#x27;s commercial activity developing in Hoveton. The area around Wroxham Bridge is a local shopping centre, mainly due to the presence of Roys of Wroxham – situated near Wroxham Bridge since 1899 and, since the 1930s, proud bearer of the accolade &quot;world&#x27;s largest village store&quot;. Roys owns much of the commercial property in the area. Roys of Wroxham is entirely situated in Hoveton, as are the local post office and the Hotel Wroxham. 

It seems that the proximity and name of Wroxham Bridge, one side of which, naturally, is in Hoveton, gave rise to the common erroneous attribution of the name &#x27;Wroxham&#x27; to that part of Hoveton that is close to the river and may be considered the commercial centre for both villages. Like many other local amenities, the railway station is actually located in Hoveton.

Wroxham in 1954 is featured in film held by the Cinema Museum in London. Ref HM0568.

==Significant buildings==
The Church of St Mary the Virgin is a grade I listed building and stands at the top of a steep slope above the River Bure. It is built of flint with limestone dressings and with lead roofs. It has a high tower and a famous Norman (12th century) south doorway, stained blue, with seven orders and three shafts, described by the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as &#x27;barbaric and glorious&#x27;. The church was heavily restored in the Victorian age. In the churchyard is the Trafford Mausoleum, mediaeval in appearance but built in 1831 to designs by the architect Anthony Salvin. The area near the church was historically the core of the village. A brick and pantile manor house to the south east of the church has stepped gables showing Dutch influence, and a panel dating to 1623. A picturesque red brick grade II listed cottage dating from about 1820 abuts the churchyard.

Other significant houses in the village include Keys Hill House, built to the east of Norwich Road around 1890 by important Norwich architect, Edward Boardman, as a substantial country house in Jacobean style. It was briefly used as a camp for Italian prisoners of war and later as an old people&#x27;s home. George Formby, the early twentieth-century entertainer, once owned a riverside home in Beech Road, off the Avenue, a thatched house called Heronby, built in 1907. Nearby is Charles Close, a mid-20th century residential development on the site of the Charles family&#x27;s large Georgian mansion, Wroxham House, demolished in 1954. Closer to Wroxham Broad to the south stands the early 18th century red brick estate house Broad House, formerly the seat of the local land-owning Trafford family, more recently a &#x27;boutique&#x27; hotel. On the west side of Norwich Road stands the large former village inn, The Castle, which has been converted into flats. The red brick Victorian school house stands between Norwich Road and the church, the additional post-war school buildings having been demolished after the school closed in the 1980s (although the old school house continued as a Steiner school until the 2000s).

==Sport and leisure==

Wroxham has a non-League football club, Wroxham F.C., who play at Trafford Park.

==Literary reference==
The 20th-century children&#x27;s author, Arthur Ransome, visited Wroxham in the 1930s. In his book &quot;Coot Club&quot; (1934), he describes the busy scene on the river at Wroxham Bridge with numerous boats, a wherry, punts, motor cruisers, and sailing yachts, jostling for a mooring.

==Wherry base==
In April 2011, a base for the restoration of the Norfolk wherry was opened in Hartwell Road by the Wherry Yacht Charter Charitable Trust. Work began with the restoration of the Edwardian wherry yacht, the &quot;Norada&quot;, with restoration of another wherry yacht, the &quot;Olive,&quot; and the pleasure wherry, the &quot;Hathor&quot;, projected over the following two years. Once restored, the wherries are intended to be available for use by school and youth groups as well as by private charter. A third of the cost of the project came from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

==Transport==

===Railways===

Hoveton and Wroxham railway station is located over in Hoveton and was previously called &quot;Wroxham&quot;. It is a stop on the Bittern Line between , and , with services operated by Greater Anglia.

====Heritage====

The Bure Valley Railway is a minimum gauge heritage railway which runs from to . At , it is Norfolk&#x27;s longest railway of less than standard gauge.

Barton House Railway is a miniature steam-driven railway (now two railways) large enough for passengers, with a full-size signal box and signals, and a museum of railway artefacts. It has been open to the public since 1963, in a large riverside garden in Hartwell Road. It is based on the Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway, which operated some of the train services in East Anglia before British railway nationalisation in 1947. The original railway runs on a track with a miniature steam locomotive. In 1979, work started on the &#x27;Riverside&#x27; railway which ran initially with an electric engine and later with a steam locomotive. The railway is run by volunteers and makes donations from proceeds to local charities.

===Buses===

Bus routes in and around Wroxham are operated primarily by First Eastern Counties and Konectbus. Destinations include Norwich, Sprowston, Aylsham and Acle.

<text>Annie M. Sprinkle (born Ellen F. Steinberg on July 23, 1954) is an American certified sexologist, performance artist, former sex worker, and advocate for sex work and health care. 

Sprinkle has worked as a prostitute, sex educator, feminist stripper, pornographic film actress, and sex film producer and director. In 1996, she became the first known porn star to get a doctoral degree, earning a PhD in human sexuality from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco.

Identifying as ecosexual, Sprinkle is best known for her self-help style of pornography, teaching individuals about pleasure, and for her conventional pornographic film &quot;Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle&quot; (1981). Through the production of feminist based pornographic content, include understanding of female genitalia and pornography based on women&#x27;s desires, Sprinkle has contributed to feminist pornography and the larger social movement of feminism; she is also known for contributing to the rise of the post-porn movement and bisexual/lesbian pornography. Sprinkle, a bisexual woman and member of the LGBTQ+ community, married her long-time partner Beth Stephens in Canada on January 14, 2007.

== Life and career ==
Sprinkle was born Ellen F. Steinberg on July 23, 1954, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a Russian-Jewish mother and a Polish-Jewish father. Her family moved to Los Angeles, California, when she was five years old, and she lived in Panama from age thirteen to seventeen. At eighteen, she began working at the ticket booth at the Cine-Plaza Theatre in Tucson, Arizona, when &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (1972) was playing. The film was busted, and when Steinberg had to appear in court as a witness, she met and began a relationship with &quot;Deep Throat&#x27;s&quot; director, Gerard Damiano, becoming his mistress. She followed him to New York City, where she lived for twenty-two years.

Not long after becoming Damiano&#x27;s mistress, Steinberg began working in porn herself and, at that time, started calling herself &quot;Annie.&quot; As her career continued, she says that one night, &quot;as if from the goddess herself,&quot; the name &quot;Annie Sprinkle&quot; came to her. She later changed her name legally to Annie Sprinkle. Her first porn movie was &quot;Teenage Deviate&quot; released in 1975. Perhaps her best known mainstream porn featured role was in &quot;Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle&quot; (co-directed by Sprinkle and sexploitation veteran Joseph W. Sarno) which was the No. 2 grossing porn film of 1981.

In 1991, Sprinkle created the &quot;Sluts and Goddesses&quot; workshop, which became the basis for her 1992 production &quot;The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop – Or How To Be A Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps.&quot; The film was co-produced and co-directed with videographer Maria Beatty, and it featured music by composer Pauline Oliveros. Sprinkle pioneered new genres of sexually explicit film and video such as edu-porn, gonzo, post porn, xxx docudrama, art porn, and feminist erotica. Sprinkle has also presented many sex workshops with fellow sex facilitator Barbara Carrellas, with whom she presented the stage production &quot;Metamorphosex.&quot;

Sprinkle has appeared in almost 200 films, including hard- and softcore pornography, B movies, loops, and numerous documentaries. She starred in Nick Zedd&#x27;s experimental films &quot;War Is Menstrual Envy&quot; (1992), &quot;Ecstasy in Entropy&quot; (1999), and &quot;Electra Elf: The Beginning&quot; (2005). She also appeared in various television shows including four HBO &quot;Real Sex&quot; programs. She has also produced, directed, and starred in several of her own films, such as &quot;Annie Sprinkle&#x27;s Herstory of Porn&quot;, &quot;Annie Sprinkle&#x27;s Amazing World of Orgasm&quot;, and &quot;Linda/Les &amp; Annie—The First Female to Male Transsexual Love Story&quot;. Her work in adult films earned her a spot on the Adult Star Path of Fame in Edison, New Jersey, and she was inducted to both the AVN Hall of Fame and the XRCO Hall of Fame in 1999. For three decades, she has presented her work as a visiting artist at many major universities and colleges in the US and Europe.

Annie Sprinkle is known as the &quot;prostitute and porn star turned sex educator and artist.&quot; Her best known theater and performance art piece is her &quot;Public Cervix Announcement&quot;, in which she invites the audience to &quot;celebrate the female body&quot; by viewing her cervix with a speculum and flashlight. She also performed &quot;The Legend of the Ancient Sacred Prostitute&quot;, in which she did a &quot;sex magic&quot; masturbation ritual on stage. She has toured one-woman shows internationally for 17 years, some of which were titled &quot;Post Porn Modernist&quot;, &quot;Annie Sprinkle&#x27;s Herstory of Porn&quot;, and &quot;Hardcore from the Heart&quot;. She then performed two-woman shows with Beth Stephens titled &quot;Exposed; Experiments in Love, Sex, Death and Art&quot;, &quot;Dirty Sex Ecology&quot;, &quot;Earthly: An Ecosex Bootcamp&quot;, and &quot;Ecosex Walking Tour&quot;.

Her work and publications, spanning over four decades, are studied in courses at numerous universities, in theater history, women&#x27;s studies, performance studies, LGBTQ studies and film studies courses. Through The New School of Erotic Touch, she has released several video classes, including &quot;Female Genital Massage&quot; and &quot;Amazing World of Orgasm.&quot; Currently her lecture presentation is called &quot;My Life and Work as a Feminist Porn Activist, Radical Sex Educator, and Ecosexual&quot;. She has also presented dozens of &quot;Free Sidewalk Sex Clinics&quot;, offering free sex education to the public in public space.

Sprinkle&#x27;s work has always been about sexuality, with a political, spiritual and artistic bent. In December 2005, she committed to doing seven years of art projects about love with her art collaborator and eventual wife, Beth Stephens. They called this their &quot;Love Art Laboratory.&quot; Part of their project was to do an experimental art wedding each year, and each year had a different theme and color. The seven-year structure was adapted to their project by invitation of artist Linda M. Montano. Sprinkle and Stephens have done twenty-one art weddings, eighteen with ecosexual themes. They married the Earth, Sky, Sea, Moon, Appalachian Mountains, the Sun, and other non-human entities in nine different countries including at Montreal&#x27;s Edgy Women Festival in 2011.

She was featured in Maya Gallus&#x27;s 1997 documentary film &quot;&quot;.

Sprinkle and her partner Beth Stephens became pioneers of ecosexuality, a kind of earth-loving sexual identity, which states, &quot;The Earth is our lover&quot;. Their Ecosex Manifesto proclaims that anyone can identify as an ecosexual along with being &quot;GLBTQI, heterosexual, asexual, and/or Other.&quot;

Sprinkle identifies as a sex-positive feminist, and much of her activist and sex education work reflects this philosophy. In 2009, she appeared in the French documentary film &quot;Mutantes: Punk, Porn, Feminism&quot;, speaking about the beginnings of the movement as well as her own contributions to it.

In 2017, Sprinkle and Stephens were official artists in Documenta 14. They presented performances and visual art, lectured, and previewed their new film documentary, &quot;Water Makes Us Wet: An Ecosexual Adventure&quot;.

Harvard&#x27;s Schlesinger Library acquired her papers from 1967-2010, including those covering work with her partner Elizabeth Stephens.

== Feminism and environmental activism ==
Sprinkle is known as a contributor to the development of pornography that intends to be feminist and is known for her disagreement with women against pornography, feminists who do not believe that the creation of feminist porn is possible and argue that porn is a means of hyper sexualization of women, that it is inherently harmful, promotes violence, and objectifies women. In contrast Sprinkle is known for arguing that women should contribute to the production of pornography or other erotic media and that censorship or restrictions on pornography will not cease its production. 

As a porn actress, Sprinkle refused to play any submissive roles. She also drew greater attention to the female orgasm. A stated aim of her performance art and other works has been to challenge the censorship of female genitals including the vulva, clitoris, vagina.

Sprinkle and her wife Beth Stephens are known for naming and promoting a combination of environmental activism and sexuality called ecosexuality. They state ecosexuality involves seeing nature as a lover, viewing people&#x27;s relationship with the Earth is two-sided and considering humans accountable for taking care of the planet and the planet as responsible for taking care of us. Ecosexuality combining sexuality and ecology with an added focus on female sexuality and opposition to heterosexual and patriarchal sexual dynamics of dominance and exploitation places it within ecofeminism, which highlights how women and nature are treated similarly in a patriarchal society.

After receiving her breast cancer diagnosis, Sprinkle made a collage of her breast tissue scans in order to provoke questions about whether a body that has been subject to surgical procedures and illness can be a sexual one. Sprinkle continued to engage in this medical commentary by juxtaposing medical scans with erotic images and using an electrocardiogram to record the waves of an orgasm. In her performance &quot;Public Cervix Announcement,&quot; Sprinkle inserted a speculum into her vaginal canal to display her cervix to the audience. The previous acted as satirical-commentary on the private and invasive nature of gynecological procedures. Sprinkle has characterized her own art involving erotic and explicit imagery of the vulva and internal female anatomy as feminist activism.

== Post-porn movement ==
The post-porn movement is a counterculture body of scholarship and ideals that were developed within Europe and the USA. Within the post-porn movement there is a critical lens applied to corporations producing pornography and non-corporate pornographic content is instead valued. The post-porn movement also values the production of pornography which centres queer and gender diverse folks as well as questions the racialization and reliance on stereotypes found in the pornography industry. Sprinkle has contributed to the post-porn movement explicitly in her now retired show &quot;Post-Porn Modernist&quot; and implicitly through her artistic body of work which engages in critical reflection and parody. Sprinkle has also contributed to this movement by challenging who can be represented in porn and which bodies are sexual ones.

<doc id="98958" wikidata="Q515105" url="?curid=98958" title="Dunstanburgh Castle">
<text>Dunstanburgh Castle is a 14th-century fortification on the coast of Northumberland in northern England, between the villages of Craster and Embleton. The castle was built by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster between 1313 and 1322, taking advantage of the site&#x27;s natural defences and the existing earthworks of an Iron Age fort. Thomas was a leader of a baronial faction opposed to King Edward II, and probably intended Dunstanburgh to act as a secure refuge, should the political situation in southern England deteriorate. The castle also served as a statement of the Earl&#x27;s wealth and influence and would have invited comparisons with the neighbouring royal castle of Bamburgh. Thomas probably only visited his new castle once, before being captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge as he attempted to flee royal forces for the safety of Dunstanburgh. Thomas was executed, and the castle became the property of the Crown before passing into the Duchy of Lancaster.

Dunstanburgh&#x27;s defences were expanded in the 1380s by John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, in the light of the threat from Scotland and the peasant uprisings of 1381. The castle was maintained in the 15th century by the Crown, and formed a strategic northern stronghold in the region during the Wars of the Roses, changing hands between the rival Lancastrian and Yorkist factions several times. The fortress never recovered from the sieges of these campaigns, and by the 16th century the Warden of the Scottish Marches described it as having fallen into &quot;wonderfull great decaye&quot;. As the Scottish border became more stable, the military utility of the castle steadily diminished, and King James I finally sold the property off into private ownership in 1604. The Grey family owned it for several centuries; increasingly ruinous, it became a popular subject for artists, including Thomas Girtin and J. M. W. Turner, and formed the basis for a poem by Matthew Lewis in 1808.

The castle&#x27;s ownership changed during the 19th and 20th centuries; by the 1920s its owner Sir Arthur Sutherland could no longer afford to maintain Dunstanburgh, and he placed it under the guardianship of the state in 1930. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, measures were taken to defend the Northumberland coastline from a potential German invasion. The castle was used as an observation post and the site was refortified with trenches, barbed wire, pill boxes and a minefield. In the 21st century, the castle is owned by the National Trust and run by English Heritage. The ruins are protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and are part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, forming an important natural environment for birds and amphibians.

Dunstanburgh Castle was built in the centre of a designed medieval landscape, surrounded by three artificial lakes called meres covering a total of . The curtain walls enclose , making it the largest castle in Northumberland. The most prominent part of the castle is the Great Gatehouse, a massive three-storey fortification, considered by historians Alastair Oswald and Jeremy Ashbee to be &quot;one of the most imposing structures in any English castle&quot;. Rectangular towers protect the walls, including the Lilburn Tower, which looks out towards Bamburgh Castle, and the Egyncleugh Tower, positioned above Queen Margaret&#x27;s Cove. Three internal complexes of buildings, now ruined, supported the earl&#x27;s household, the castle constable&#x27;s household, and the running of the surrounding estates. A harbour was built to the southeast of the castle, of which only a stone quay survives.

==History==

===Prehistory – 13th century===
The site of Dunstanburgh Castle in north-east Northumberland was probably first occupied in prehistoric times. A promontory fort with earthwork defences was built on the same location at the end of the Iron Age, possibly being occupied from the 3rd century BC into the Roman period. By the 14th century, the defences had been long abandoned, and the land was being used for arable crops. Dunstanburgh formed part of the barony of Embleton, a village that lies inland to the west, traditionally owned by the earls of Lancaster.

The origins and the earliest appearance of the name &quot;Dunstanburgh&quot; are uncertain. Versions of the name, &quot;Dunstanesburghe&quot; and &quot;Donstanburgh&quot; were in use by the time of the castle&#x27;s construction, however, and Dunstanburgh may stem from a combination of the name of the local village of Dunstan, and the Old English word &quot;burh&quot;, meaning fortress.

===Early 14th century===

====Construction====

Dunstanburgh Castle was constructed by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, between 1313 and 1322. Thomas was an immensely powerful English baron, the second richest man in England after the King, with major land holdings across the kingdom. He had a turbulent relationship with his cousin, King Edward II, and had been a ringleader in the capture and killing of Edward&#x27;s royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, in 1312.

It is uncertain exactly why Thomas decided to build Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong defensive site, it was some distance from the local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.

In the years following Gaveston&#x27;s death, however, civil conflict in England rarely seemed far away, and it is currently believed that Thomas probably intended to create a secure retreat, a safe distance away from Edward&#x27;s forces in the south. He also probably hoped to erect a prominent status symbol, illustrating his wealth and authority, and challenging that of the King. He may perhaps also have hoped to create a planned town alongside the castle, possibly intending to relocate the population of Embleton there.

Building work on the castle had commenced by May 1313, with labourers beginning to excavate the moat and starting to construct the castle buildings. Some of the outer walls may have been built by workers from Embleton as part of their feudal dues to Thomas. The operations were overseen by a mason, Master Elias, possibly Elias de Burton, who had been previously involved in the construction of Conwy Castle in North Wales. Iron, Newcastle coal and Scandinavian wood was brought in for use in the project. By the end of the year £184 had been spent, and work continued for several years. A licence to crenellate – a form of royal authorisation for a new castle – was issued by Edward II in 1316, and a castle constable was appointed in 1319, charged with defending both the castle and the surrounding manors of Embleton and Stamford. By 1322 the castle was probably complete.

The resulting castle was huge, protected on one side by the sea cliffs, with a stone curtain wall, a massive gatehouse, and six towers around the outside. A harbour was built on the south side of the fortress, enabling access from the sea. Northumbria was a lawless region in this period, suffering from the activities of thieves and &quot;schavaldours&quot;, a type of border brigand, many of whom were members of Edward II&#x27;s household, and the harbour may have represented a safer way to reach the castle than land routes.

====Loss====

Thomas of Lancaster made little use of his new castle; the only time he might have visited it was in 1319 when he was on his way north to join Edward&#x27;s military campaign against Scotland. Civil war then broke out in 1321 between Edward and his enemies among the barons. After the initial royalist successes, Thomas fled the south of England for Dunstanburgh in 1322, but was intercepted en route by Sir Andrew Harclay, resulting in the Battle of Boroughbridge, in which Thomas was captured; he was later executed.

The castle passed into royal control, and Edward considered it a useful fortress for protection against the threat from Scotland. Initially it was managed by Robert de Emeldon, a merchant from Newcastle, and protected by a garrison of 40 men at arms and 40 light horsemen. Roger Maduit, a politically rehabilitated former member of Thomas&#x27;s army, was appointed as constable, followed by Sir John de Lilburn, a Northumberland &quot;schavaldour&quot; in 1323, who was in turn replaced by Roger Heron.

Maduit and the castle&#x27;s garrison took part in the Battle of Old Byland in North Yorkshire in 1322, and the garrison was subsequently increased to 130 men, predominantly light horsemen, and formed a key part of the northern defences against the Scots. By 1326, the castle was given back to Thomas&#x27;s brother, Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, with Lilburn returning as its constable, and continued to be of use in defence against the Scottish invasions over the next few decades.

===Late 14th century===

Dunstanburgh Castle was acquired by John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster through his marriage to Henry of Lancaster&#x27;s granddaughter, Blanche, in 1362. Gaunt was the 3rd son of King Edward III and, as the Duke of Lancaster, was one of the wealthiest men of his generation. He became the Lieutenant of the Scottish Marches and visited his castle in 1380.

Dunstanburgh Castle was not a primary strategic target for Scottish attack, as it was positioned away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the Scottish wars. The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from Scottish raids and Gaunt had concerns over the condition of the castle&#x27;s defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse. Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either to feed a growing garrison or to protect the crops against Scottish attacks.

In 1381 the Peasants&#x27; Revolt broke out in England, during which Gaunt was targeted by the rebels as an especially hated member of the administration. He found himself stranded in the north of England in the early part of the revolt but considered Dunstanburgh insufficiently secure to function as a safe haven, and was forced to turn to Alnwick Castle instead, which refused to let him in, fearing that his presence would invite a rebel attack.

The experience encouraged Gaunt to further expand Dunstanburgh&#x27;s defences over the next two years. A wide range of work was carried out under the direction of the constable, Thomas of Ilderton, and the mason Henry of Holme, including blocking up the entrance in the gatehouse to turn it into a keep. In 1384 a Scottish army attacked the castle but they lacked siege equipment and were unable to take the defences. Gaunt lost interest in the property after he gave up his role as the Lieutenant of the Marches. Dunstanburgh Castle remained part of the Duchy of Lancaster, but the duchy was annexed to the Crown when Gaunt&#x27;s son, Henry IV, took the throne of England in 1399.

===15th – 16th centuries===

The Scottish threat persisted, and in 1402 Dunstanburgh Castle&#x27;s constable, probably accompanied by its garrison, took part in the Battle of Homildon Hill in north Northumberland. Henry VI inherited the throne in 1422 and during the next few decades, numerous repairs were undertaken to the property&#x27;s buildings and outer defences, which had fallen into disrepair. The Wars of the Roses, a dynastic conflict between the rival houses of Lancaster and York, broke out in the middle of the 15th century. The castle was initially held by the Lancastrians, and the castle&#x27;s constable, Sir Ralph Babthorpe, died at the Battle of St Albans in 1455, fighting for the Lancastrian Henry VI.

The castle formed part of a sequence of fortifications protecting the eastern route into Scotland, and in 1461 King Edward IV attempted to break the Lancastrian stranglehold on the region. Sir Ralph Percy, one of the joint constables, defended the castle until September 1461, when he surrendered it to the Yorkists. In 1462, Henry VI&#x27;s wife, Margaret of Anjou, invaded England with a French army, landing at Bamburgh; Percy then switched sides and declared himself for the Lancastrians.
Another Yorkist army was dispatched north in November under the joint command of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick and John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester, and Sir Ralph Grey. They besieged the castle, which surrendered that Christmas. Percy was left in charge of Dunstanburgh as part of Edward IV&#x27;s attempts at reconciliation, but the next year he once again switched sides, returning the castle to the Lancastrians. Percy died at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor in 1464, and the Earl of Warwick reoccupied the castle that June following a short siege.

The castle was probably damaged during the wars, but, other than minor repairs in 1470, nothing was spent on repairs and it fell into disrepair. It was used as a base for piracy in 1470, and by the 1520s its roof was robbed for the lead for use at the castle at Wark-upon-Tweed, and further lead and timber were taken for the moot hall in Embleton. By 1538 it was described in a royal report to Henry VIII as &quot;a very ruinous house and of small strength&quot;, and it was observed that only the gatehouse was still habitable. Some repairs were carried out to the walls by Sir William Ellerker, the King&#x27;s receiver, but a 1543 survey showed it to still be in poor condition.

In 1550 the Warden of the Middle and Eastern Marches, Sir Robert Bowes, described Dunstanburgh as being &quot;in wonderfull great decaye&quot;. A report in 1584 suggested that it would cost Queen Elizabeth I £1,000 to restore the castle, but argued that it was too far from the Scottish border to be worth repairing. Alice Craster, a wealthy widow, occupied the castle from 1594 to 1597, probably living in the gatehouse, where she carried out restoration work, and farming the surrounding estate. For much of the 16th century, local farmers bought the right to use the outer bailey of the castle to store their cattle in the event of Scottish raids, at the price of six pence a year.

===17th – 19th centuries===

In 1603, the unification of the Scottish and English crowns eliminated any residual need for Dunstanburgh Castle as a royal fortress. The following year, King James I sold the castle to Sir Thomas Windebank, Thomas Billott and William Blake, who in turn sold it onto Sir Ralph Grey, a nearby landowner, the following year. Ralph&#x27;s son, William Grey, 1st Baron Grey of Werke, was affirmed as the owner of the castle in 1625.

The Grey dynasty maintained their ownership of the castle, which passed into Lady Mary Grey&#x27;s side of the family following a law case in 1704. The lands around the castle and the outer bailey were used for growing wheat, barley and oats, and the walls were robbed of their stone for other building work. A small settlement, called Nova Scotia or Novia Scotia, was built on the site of the castle&#x27;s harbour, possibly by Scottish immigrants. Several engravings were published of the castle in the 18th century, including a somewhat inaccurate depiction by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck in 1720, and by Francis Grose and William Hutchinson in 1773 and 1776 respectively.
Mary&#x27;s descendants, the Earls of Tankerville, owned the property until the heavily indebted Charles Bennet, 6th Earl of Tankerville, sold it for £155,000 in 1869 to the trustees of the estate of the late Samuel Eyres. There had been some attempts at restoration in the early 19th century, and the passageway through the gatehouse was modified and reopened in 1885. The historian Cadwallader John Bates undertook fieldwork at the castle in the 1880s, publishing a comprehensive work in 1891, and a professional architectural plan of the ruins was produced in 1893. Nonetheless, a representative of the estate expressed his concern to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne about the condition of the castle in 1898, noting the poor repair of much of the stonework and the importance of the ongoing preservation work that the estate was undertaking.

Dunstanburgh&#x27;s ruins became a popular subject for artists from the end of the 18th century onwards. Thomas Girtin toured the region and painted the castle, his picture dominated by what art historian Souren Melikian describes as &quot;the forces of nature unleashed&quot;, with &quot;wild waves&quot; and dark clouds swirling around the ruins. J. M. W. Turner was influenced by Girtin, and when he first painted the castle in 1797 he similarly focused on the wind and the waves around the ancient ruins, taking some artistic licence with the view of the castle to reinforce its sense of isolated and former grandeur. Turner drew on his visit to produce further works in oils, watercolours, etchings, and sketches, through until the 1830s, making the castle one of the most common subjects in his corpus of work.

A similarly wild view was painted by Thomas Allom showing a ship in a heavy sea offshore, the wreck of which is taken up by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in her poetical illustration to an engraving of that work published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839.

===20th and 21st centuries===

A golf course was constructed alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional course at the castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became too much for him and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship of the state in 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.

Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, concerns grew in the British government about the threat of German invasion along the east coast of England. The bays just to the north of Dunstanburgh Castle were vulnerable targets for an enemy amphibious landing, and efforts were made to fortify the castle and the surrounding area in 1940, as part of a wider line of defences erected by Sir Edmund Ironside.

The castle itself was occupied by a unit of the Royal Armoured Corps, who served as observers; the soldiers appear to have relied on the stone walls for protection rather than trenches, and, unusually, no additional firing points were cut out of the stonework, as typically happened elsewhere. The surrounding beaches were defended with lines of barbed wire, slit trenches and square weapons pits, reinforced by concrete pillboxes to the north and south of the castle, at least partially laid down by the 1st Battalion Essex Regiment.
A wide ditch was dug at the north end of the moat to prevent tanks from breaking through and following the track south past the castle, and a wide anti-personnel minefield was laid to the south-west to prevent infantry soldiers from circumventing the castle&#x27;s defences and advancing down into Craster. After the end of the war, the barbed wire was cleared away from the beaches by local Italian prisoners of war, although the two pillboxes, the remnants of the anti-tank ditch and some of the trenches and weapons pits remain.

In 1961, Arthur&#x27;s son, Sir Ivan Sutherland, passed the estate to the National Trust. Archaeological surveys were carried out in 1985, 1986 and 1989 by Durham University, and between 2003 and 2006 researchers from English Heritage carried a major archaeological investigation of of land around the castle.

In the 21st century, the castle remains owned by the National Trust and is managed by English Heritage. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and the ruins are protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building. It lies within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, with parts of the site comprising a Special Protection Area for the conservation of wild birds. The National Trust has encouraged the land around the outside of the castle to remain waterlogged to enable the conservation of amphibians and bird species, and the inside of the castle is protected from grazing animals to encourage nesting birds.

==Architecture and landscape==

===Landscape===

Dunstanburgh Castle occupies a site within a larger body of National Trust land along the coast. The castle is situated on a prominent headland, part of the Great Whin Sill geological formation. On the south side of the castle there is a gentle slope across low-lying, boggy ground, but along the northern side, the Gull Crag cliffs form a natural barrier up to high. The cliffs are punctuated by various defiles, formed from weaknesses in the black basalt rock, including the famous Rumble Churn.

The landscape around the castle was carefully designed in the 14th century as a deer park or planned borough, and would have looked similar to those at the contemporary castles of Framlingham, Kenilworth, Leeds and Whittington; in particular, Kenilworth may have been a specific model for Dunstanburgh. The area around the castle was dominated by three shallow artificial lakes, called meres, and accessed by three gates on the north, west and south sides. The meres were fed from a freshwater spring inland, linked to the meres by an underground stone channel. The meres were originally bounded by a sod-cast boundary bank and ditch; today this is heavily eroded, and up to high. The main route by land into the castle would have been from the village of Embleton, through the West Gate.

The North Mere is in area, and is blocked off on its northern end by a sod-cast bank, adjacent to the site of the North Gate. The southern half takes the form of a long moat, which was recorded as being deep in the medieval period, terminating in the West Gate. The northern part of this mere occasionally floods in the 21st century, creating a temporary lake, and the moated section usually still contains some standing water. The West Mere, covering , stretches away from the location of West Gate and is blocked at the far end by a small, stone dam. Three rectangular fishponds were built alongside the West Mere, the smallest, probably a stew pond for raising young fish, being fed with water from the lake. A protective earthen bank, probably originally reinforced by a timber palisade, ran for approximately along either side of the West Gate, where a gatehouse was probably built. At the far end of the lake complex was the South Mere, in size, with the South Gate positioned in its eastern corner.

A harbour was built south-east of the castle, which would originally have been used to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its quay, built from basalt boulders, and it may not have been in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is such siege work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.

===Architecture===

Dunstanburgh Castle&#x27;s buildings are located around the outside of the fortification&#x27;s outer bailey, enclosed by a stone curtain wall, which enclose , making it the largest castle in Northumberland. Possibly from the very start of the castle, and certainly by the 1380s, the castle buildings formed three distinct complexes supporting the Earl&#x27;s household, the castle&#x27;s constable and the administration of the Embleton barony respectively. The inside of the bailey still shows the marks of former strip farming, which can be seen in winter.

The southern and western parts of the walls were originally faced with a local ashlar sandstone with a core of basalt rubble; the sandstone was mostly quarried at Howick. The sandstone has since been stripped from the western parts of the wall, and the sandstone along the eastern end of the walls gives way to small limestone blocks, originally only laid high with a parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.

Moving anticlockwise around the curtain wall from the north-west, the rectangular Lilburn Tower looks out across Embleton beach. The tower was named after an early castle constable, John de Lilburn, but may have been built under Thomas of Lancaster; it was intended as a high-status residence, high, square with thick walls, with a guardroom for soldiers on the ground floor. The rectangular towers at Dunstanburgh reflects the local tradition in Northumberland, and are similar to those at nearby Alnwick. Further along the wall there are the remains of a small tower, called Huggam&#x27;s House by local tradition. Earthworks around the inside of the curtain wall suggest that there may once have been a complex of buildings stretching between Lilburn Tower and Huggam&#x27;s House.

On the southwest corner of the walls are the castle gatehouses. The most prominent of these is the Great Gatehouse, a massive three-storey fortification, comprising two drum-shaped towers of ashlar stone; originally high. This was heavily influenced by the Edwardian gatehouses in North Wales, such as that at Harlech, but contains unique features, such as the frontal towers, and is considered by historians Alastair Oswald and Jeremy Ashbee to be &quot;one of the most imposing structures in any English castle&quot;. In the 1380s this gatehouse was further strengthened with a long barbican, of which only the rubble foundations now survive, around high.

The passageway through the gatehouse was protected by a portcullis and possibly a set of wooden gates. The ground floor contained two guardrooms, each wide, and latrines, with spiral staircases in the corner of the gatehouse running up to the first floor, where relatively well-lit chambers with fireplaces probably accommodated the garrison&#x27;s officers. The staircases continued up to the second floor, containing the castle&#x27;s great hall, an antechamber, and bedchamber, originally intended for the use of Thomas of Lancaster and his family. Four towers extended above the gatehouse&#x27;s lead-covered roof for an additional two storeys of height, giving extensive views of the surrounding area. This design may have influenced the construction of Henry IV&#x27;s gatehouse at Lancaster Castle.
Immediately to the west of the Great Gatehouse is John of Gaunt&#x27;s Gatehouse, originally either two or three storeys tall, but now only surviving at the foundation level. This gatehouse replaced the Great Gatehouse as the main entrance, and would have contained a porter&#x27;s lodge, defended by a combination of a portcullis and an long barbican. A inner bailey was approximately , defended by a high mantlet wall, was constructed in the 1380s behind John of Gaunt&#x27;s Gatehouse and the Great Gatehouse. This complex comprised a vaulted inner gatehouse, square, and six buildings, including an antechamber, kitchen and bakehouse.

Further along, the south side of the walls is the Constable&#x27;s Tower, a square tower containing comfortable accommodation for the castle&#x27;s constable, including stone window seats. On the inside of the walls are the foundations of a hall and chamber, built before 1351, part of a larger complex of buildings used by the constable and his household, approximately square. To the west of the Constable&#x27;s Tower is a small turret that projects from the upper wall – an unusual feature, similar to that at Pickering Castle – and a mural garderobe; and to the east a small oblong turret with a single chamber, .

In the south-east corner of the walls, the Egyncleugh Tower – whose name means &quot;eagle&#x27;s ravine&quot; in the Northumbrian dialect – overlooks Queen Margaret&#x27;s Cove below. A three-storey, square building, across, Egyncleugh Tower was designed to house a castle official, and included a small gateway and drawbridge into the castle, either for the use of the castle constable, or possibly for the local people.

There is a postern gate in the eastern wall, added in the 1450s, and a further gateway in the north-eastern corner, which gave access to Castle Point and Gull Crag below. Along the inside of the curtain walls are the foundations of a yard, , and a large rectangular building, usually identified as a grange or a barn. This would have probably supported the administration of the Embleton estates, and have included the auditor&#x27;s chamber and other facilities.

===Interpretation===

Early analysis of Dunstanburgh Castle focused on its qualities as a military, and a defensive site, but more recent work has emphasised the symbolic aspects of its design and the surrounding landscape. Although the castle was intended as a secure bolt-hole for Thomas of Lancaster should events go awry in the south of England, it was, however &quot;clearly not an inconspicuous hiding place&quot;, as the English Heritage research team have pointed out: it was a spectacular construction, located in the centre of a huge, carefully designed medieval landscape. The meres surrounding the castle would have reflected the castle walls and towers, turning the outcrop into a virtual island and producing what the historians Oswald and Ashbee have called &quot;an awe-inspiring and beautiful sight&quot;.

The different elements of the castle were also positioned for a particular effect. Unusually, the huge Great Gatehouse faced southeast, away from the main road, hiding its extraordinary architectural features. This may have been because Thomas intended to establish a new settlement in front of it, but the gatehouse was also probably intended to be viewed from the harbour, where the most senior visitors were expected to arrive. The Lilburn Tower was positioned to be clearly – and provocatively – visible to Edward II&#x27;s castle at Bamburgh, away along the coast, and would have been elegantly framed by the entranceway to the Great Gatehouse for any visitors. It was also positioned on a set of natural basalt pillars, which – although inconvenient to build upon – would have enhanced its dramatic appearance and reflection in the meres.

The design of the castle may also have alluded to Arthurian mythology, which was a popular set of ideals and beliefs among the English ruling classes at the time. Thomas appears to have had an interest in the Arthurian legends and used the pseudonym &quot;King Arthur&quot; in his correspondence with the Scots. Dunstanburgh, with an ancient fort at its centre encircled by water, may have been an allusion to Camelot, and in turn to Thomas&#x27;s claim to political authority over the failing Edward II, and was also strikingly similar to contemporary depictions of Sir Lancelot&#x27;s castle of &quot;Joyous Garde&quot;.

==Folklore==

Dunstanburgh Castle has been closely associated with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle and spends the rest of his life attempting to find a way back inside.

It is unclear when the story first emerged, but similar stories, possibly inspired by medieval Arthurian legends, exist at the nearby locations of Hexham and the Eildon Hills. Matthew Lewis wrote a poem, &quot;Sir Guy the Seeker&quot;, popularising the story in 1808, with subsequent versions produced by W. G. Thompson in 1821 and James Service in 1822. The tale continues to be told as part of the local oral tradition.

Several other oral traditions about the castle survive. One of these involves a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing the key to her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile. Another centres on a man called Gallon who was left in charge of the castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six Venetian glasses. The historian Katrina Porteous has noted that in the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the Gallon of this story.

There are local stories of tunnels stretching from Dunstanburgh Castle to Craster Tower, Embleton, and nearby Proctor Steads, as well as a tunnel running from the castle well to the west of the castle. These stories may be linked to the presence of the drainage system around the castle.

<text>The IBM 370 printer was used on the IBM 305 RAMAC computer system, introduced by IBM on September 14, 1956. The 370 was connected to the 305 by a serial data line from the &quot;S track&quot; of the computer&#x27;s drum memory (the printer and punch both obtain information from a single output track, the control as to what information to print or punch and how, is within the print and punch units) and printed 80-columns with a punched tape controlled carriage. Line formatting was programmed by inserting wire jumpers into a plugboard control panel.

The printer mechanism used an eight sided, seven position (56 character) print slug in a horizontal orientation. The X, O, and 2 bits of the character code rotate the slug and the 1, 4, and 8 bits selected the position. The platen hammer then struck the paper from behind, causing the selected character to print. Of the 56 characters on the print slug, only 47 were printable with the standard valid character set of the IBM 305 computer—the complete alphabet, numbers 0–9, and eleven special characters (48 characters, including the blank character).

The printer can achieve the speed of 50 columns per second, with processing of 30 cards per minute; At two seconds per line can be achieved 1,800 lines per hour.

<text>Rafael Hernández Colón (October 24, 1936 – May 2, 2019) was a Puerto Rican politician who served as the governor of Puerto Rico from 1973 to 1977 and 1985 to 1993 for a total of three terms. An experienced politician, Hernández held the record for having been the youngest Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to date, having won his first term at the age of 36. Hernández was also the person to have run for governor the most times, a total of five. During his terms as governor, Hernández Colón&#x27;s administrations were known for trying to invigorate the Puerto Rican economy as well as for defending the political status quo of the island. He is also the second longest-serving Puerto Rico Governor with 12 years of service due to his three terms.

==Early years and education==
Hernández Colón was born October 24, 1937, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Rafael Hernández Matos and Doraldina &quot;Dora&quot; Colón Clavell. Rafael and Dora married in 1934 and had three children. Rafael was the oldest. Rafael had two brothers José A. (born 1939) and César A. (1942). Hernández Colón graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy and College in Wayne, Pennsylvania, then obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Johns Hopkins University in 1956 where he graduated with honors. In 1959, he obtained his degree in law from the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and as valedictorian of his class. Between 1961 and 1965 he was a lecturer on civil procedure at the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico in Ponce.

==Political career==
Hernández Colón affiliated himself with the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (&quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot;, PPD). He served as Associate Commissioner of Public Service under the governorship of Roberto Sánchez Vilella. In 1965 he was named Secretary of the Department of Justice.

===President of the Senate===
Hernández Colón was elected to the Senate of Puerto Rico in the 1968 elections, in which his party retained control of the Senate but lost the governorship and House of Representatives. As President of the Senate, Hernández Colón became the Popular Democratic Party&#x27;s president and main opposition leader. As a Senator, he proposed a constitutional amendment to lower the minimum voting age to 18, which passed in 1970. He also spearheaded efforts to persuade Congress to stop bombing practices on the island of Culebra. On the issue of political status, he opposed Governor Ferré&#x27;s creation of an Ad Hoc Committee for the Presidential Vote, alleging that it was a misleading effort to enhance the island&#x27;s current Commonwealth status in accordance with the results of the 1967 status plebiscite. In 1972, he successfully ran for Governor of Puerto Rico, defeating the incumbent by approximately 95,000 votes, or 7.3%. He remains the last PDP gubernatorial candidate to have achieved victory with over 50% of votes.

===First term (1973–1977)===
During his first term, the island was wracked by recession, induced by the 1973 oil crisis, which hit Puerto Rico particularly hard because of the many businesses that were directly related to petroleum processing in Puerto Rico. After enacting austerity measures and tax increases, the economy recovered by 1976.

In 1973, he appointed, alongside President Richard Nixon, an Ad Hoc Committee for Puerto Rico to enhance Puerto Rico&#x27;s Commonwealth status pursuant to the people&#x27;s mandate in the 1967 elections. The Committee rendered a report and proposal for a Compact of Permanent Union Between Puerto Rico and the United States that expanded Puerto Rico&#x27;s autonomy over local affairs, expanded its right to participate in international matters, created a mechanism to object to the automatic application of federal laws, and allowed for the election of a delegate to the U.S. Senate. President Gerald Ford, who replaced Nixon, did not react to the report until after the 1976 elections, when he proposed statehood for the island. According to Hernández Colón, his delayed response was due to political pressure by island Republicans, who supported Ford in his primary against Ronald Reagan. Nevertheless, the Compact was approved by the House Subcommittee on Insular Affairs.

In 1974, &quot;Time&quot; magazine recognized Rafael Hernández Colón as one of the world&#x27;s young leaders.

Hernández Colón, Treasury Secretary Salvador Casellas, and Resident Commissioner Jaime Benítez successfully lobbied Congress for Section 936, which created a tax incentive for U.S. corporations that established in Puerto Rico. The incentive remained active until 1996, when Congress enacted a phase-out which ended in 2006. Its elimination is often credited as one of the main causes for Puerto Rico&#x27;s current fiscal and economic crisis.

Hernández Colón also signed Law No. 80 of 1976, which required just cause for terminating employment. In 2018, Law 80 became a hotly debated issue when the governor proposed its elimination.

Hernández Colón lost the 1976 race for Governor to then Mayor of San Juan, Carlos Romero Barceló, by 3%. He then lost again to Romero Barceló in 1980, in this second matchup by a slim margin of approximately 3,000 votes, or 0.2%.

===Second and third terms (1985–1993)===
Hernández Colón ran again against Romero Barceló in the November 1984 elections and was victorious by about 54,000 votes (48 to 45% respectively). He won re-election in the 1988 election, besting his main rival Baltasar Corrada del Río by 49 to 46%.

As part of his 1984 electoral campaign, Hernández Colón released a musical album with Puerto Rican country music titled &quot;Ahora Es Que Vamos&quot; (&quot;Here We Go Now&quot;).

In 1991, Hernández Colón signed a law stating that the only official language of Puerto Rico should be Spanish. The immediate effect was that English was no longer the second official language. While many applauded the governor&#x27;s decision, on the other hand, supporters of the Commonwealth and the parties in favor of the American federal state interpreted this law as a threat to their ideologies. In 1993, his successor Pedro Rosselló rescinded the law and reinstated English as the official language, alongside Spanish.

During this time Puerto Rico experienced an economic boom with GDP growth at 5% during the years 1987–1989 the highest since Operation Bootstrap and the Economic Boom in the United States. Unemployment dropped drastically in his term from an all-time high 25% in 1983 to 12.0% in 1990.
He lost popularity with the controversial Pabellón de Sevilla that was an attempt of a representation of Puerto Rico at the Universal Exposition of Seville in 1992.
In January 1992 Hernández announced that he would not seek re-election. On January 11, he resigned as President of the Popular Democratic Party, a post he had held for 23 years. Senator Victoria Muñoz Mendoza succeeded him as president of the party and later became a gubernatorial candidate herself.

==Personal life==
On October 24, 1959, Hernández Colón married Lila Mayoral Wirshing, daughter of the industrialist Juan Eugenio Mayoral Renovales (1906-1967), founder of Ponce Candy Industries. Rafael Hernández Colón and Lila Mayoral had four children: Rafael, Jose Alfredo, Dora Mercedes and Juan Eugenio. The latter was elected to Puerto Rico&#x27;s Senate. In early 2003, Lila Mayoral Wirshing died of cancer. Hernández Colón subsequently married attorney Nelsa López in late 2004. He had his main residence in his hometown of Ponce, in the historic downtown district.

===Retirement===
Hernández Colón published various works specializing in law. Among his works are &quot;Procedimiento Civil: Trayectoria Histórica de la Autonomía Política Puertorriqueña&quot; and &quot;Nueva Tesis&quot; which discusses the Puerto Rican Commonwealth&#x27;s political relationship with the United States.

In later years, Hernández Colón maintained his distance from public political engagement, but continued to be involved in Puerto Rico&#x27;s political affairs assisting active politicians. He occasionally appeared at official events. For example, in December 2011, he publicly admitted before the Senate of Puerto Rico that &quot;the U.S. Congress can do as it wishes with Puerto Rico.&quot;

Some political analysts speculated that Hernández exerted sizeable control over the PDP&#x27;s party structure during his retirement from office, which may have rivaled the PDP president&#x27;s.

===Illness and death===
On December 6, 2018, Hernández Colón announced he had been diagnosed with leukemia in November of that year. Hernández Colón died on May 2, 2019, at the age of 82. He was interred at Cementerio Católico San Vicente de Paul. Flags were flown at half-mast by the municipalities after his death.

==Accolades==
Hernández Colón was granted honoris causa degrees from Johns Hopkins University and Seton Hall University. He also had an honorary degree from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico, where he served as a law professor in the university&#x27;s Law School.

In 1985, Hernández Colón was awarded the Order of Merit of Duarte, Sánchez and Mella by the government of the Dominican Republic. In 1987 he was awarded the Cross of Isabella the Catholic by King Juan Carlos I and the government of Spain. That same year he was awarded the &quot;Grand Cordón del Libertador&quot; by the government of Venezuela, the Harvard Foundation Award, and the Spirit of the Caribbean Award. In 1989 he was awarded the Olympic Order Award.

On October 18, 1991, at the Campoamor Theater in Oviedo, Spain, Hernández Colón received the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature that was granted to the people of Puerto Rico by Felipe de Borbón.

<doc id="98964" wikidata="Q4597016" url="?curid=98964" title="2/1 game forcing">
<text>2/1 game forcing (&quot;Two-over-one game forcing&quot;) is a bidding system in modern contract bridge structured around the following responses to a one-level opening bid:
#a non-jump response in a new suit at the one-level is constructive and forcing for one round,
#a non-jump response in a new suit at the two-level is forcing to game, and
#a 1NT response to a major opening is forcing for one round and indicates insufficient values to immediately commit to game or bid a suit at the one-level.

The 2/1 game force does not apply to responses by a passed hand, or if there is an intervening by an opponent. Other responses are per Standard American methods in accordance with .

==Game forcing auctions==
The 2/1 auctions are: 1–2, 1–2, 1–2, 1–2, 1–2, and 1–2.

===Variations===
The following variations may be made by :
*Some play that 1–2 is not game forcing
*Some play that 2/1 is not absolutely game forcing and the pair can stop below game when responder rebids his suit. For example, 1–2; 2–3 may be treated as nonforcing.

==1NT response to major suit opening==
Because the two-level responses are stronger than in Standard American bidding, the response of 1NT is forcing for one round and is used (among other things) for weaker hands containing low-ranking suits. Since the 1NT response is forcing, hands with a three-card limit raise can start with 1NT and later jump-support partner. See Forcing notrump for additional details. Some pairs play a variant in which the 1NT response to 1 or 1 is semi-forcing.

Since opener has been forced to rebid on hands which he might otherwise have passed, he may have to rebid in a new suit with only three or even two cards.

==Other features==
Use of the 2/1 system usually implies (at least) the following additional agreements:
*Five card majors, i.e. major suit openings require at least a five-card suit;
*Either limit raises of major suit openings (i.e. the jump raise 1 – 3 or 1 – 3 shows a game-invitational hand with at least four-card support) or Bergen raises;
*Inverted minor raises, in which a jump raise of a minor suit opening is a weak preemptive bid, while a single raise is strong and forcing for one round;
*Jacoby 2NT, showing strong support with 4 or more cards;
*Splinter bids;
*New minor forcing;
*Fourth suit forcing and artificial.

==Examples==

1 – 2&lt;br&gt;
2 – 2&lt;br&gt;
Forcing to game, with original spade support and good club suit. This is different from standard bidding, in which such a sequence would show about 10 points, and club suit could be semi-fake.

1 – 2&lt;br&gt;
2 – 2NT.&lt;br&gt;
Forcing to game, with balanced hand and a good club suit.

1 – 2&lt;br&gt;
2 – 3&lt;br&gt;
Forcing, unless the partnership has agreed that this is an exception to the &quot;2/1 rule.&quot;

1 – 2&lt;br&gt;
Forcing for one round only (as in Standard American), except in the variant of 2/1 where this sequence is game forcing as well.

1 – 2&lt;br&gt;
Forcing for one round; 10 points or more with at least four clubs.

1 – 3&lt;br&gt;
Weak; 9 points or less—sometimes much less—with at least five clubs.

1 – 2&lt;br&gt;
Weak; 6-9 points with at least 3 hearts (unless Bergen raises are in use, in which case it shows precisely 3 hearts)

1 – 1NT;&lt;br&gt;
2 – 2&lt;br&gt;
Shows a weak hand, 6-9 points, with precisely two spades. Some also use this for an extremely weak hand (0-5) with three spades.

1 – 1NT;&lt;br&gt;
2 – Pass&lt;br&gt;
Shows a very weak hand, perhaps 5-7 points, with at least four clubs.

1 – 1NT;&lt;br&gt;
2 – 2&lt;br&gt;
Shows a weak hand, 5-9 points, with a long diamond suit.

1 – 1NT;&lt;br&gt;
2 – 2&lt;br&gt;
Shows a weak hand, 5-9 points, with a long heart suit.

1 – 1NT;&lt;br&gt;
2 – 3&lt;br&gt;
Shows a weak hand, 5-9 points, with a long club suit.

1 – 1NT;&lt;br&gt;
2 – 2NT;&lt;br&gt;
Shows 10-11 points without support for spades.

1 – 1NT;&lt;br&gt;
2 – 3&lt;br&gt;
Shows 10-11 points with 3-card support for spades.

1 – 3&lt;br&gt;
Shows 10-11 points with at least 4-card support for spades.

1 – 1NT;&lt;br&gt;
2 – 3&lt;br&gt;
Shows 10-11 points with a long heart suit.

1 – 2&lt;br&gt;
This is a jump response, and there are different ways of handling it. In Standard American, such a &quot;jump shift&quot; shows a very strong hand and is unequivocally forcing. However, since such hands do not occur with great frequency, it is more common today to use such a bid to show a weak hand with a long suit, unsuitable for defense. Another possibility is to play it as a &quot;fit-showing jump&quot;, showing 8-10 points, a decent heart suit, and good diamond support.

<doc id="98967" wikidata="Q5532247" url="?curid=98967" title="General Trades Union">
<text>The General Trades&#x27; Union was formed in New York City in 1833 with the purpose of uniting all of the trade societies of New York. The goal of this central union was to better coordinate the various trade unions in the New York City area, to provide assistance during conflicts with employers, and to maintain a fund for striking laborers. The GTU formed the National Trades Union, the first attempt at a nationwide union movement. The GTU of New York organised one the first strikes in the United States and initiated the system now known as collective bargaining.

==History==
The first large trade union, the General Trades&#x27; Union (GTU), was organized in New York City on 14 August 1833 by delegates from nine craft trades. It celebrated with a public parade displaying its new emblem, a banner bearing a likeness of Archimedes lifting a mountain with a lever. Ely Moore, a journeyman printer, was elected its first president. He left soon after, and with the backing of the newly formed National Trades’ Union won a seat in Congress as a Democrat. Later he helped generate Congressional support for the 10-hour workday.

John Commerford, a cabinet and chair maker, replaced Moore, and asserted that skilled artisans were only seen as commodities by their employers. Commerford did not have the benefit of experience, and thus much of what he accomplished was ad hoc. Commerford stressed education as necessary for empowering workers. True reform would come when workers knew the value of their own worth and the truth about the economic and political system. Commerford later ran for Congress on several third party tickets.

The Union was affiliated with the Locofocos, who were against the Second Bank of the United States, but refrained from political activity so as to avoid the kind of demise suffered by the Working Men&#x27;s Party in 1829–30. They staged over 40 strikes and by 1836 had a membership including 66% of New York City&#x27;s Journeyman labourers.

The GTU spread across many cities along the eastern seaboard, including Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Newark, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. By 1835 a network of trade unions developed in New York City and Philadelphia. One year later the number of unions in the network had grown to 13, with 52 local societies in New York, 53 in Philadelphia, 23 in Baltimore, and 16 in Boston.

The labor movement of the 1830s was wiped out by the financial panic of 1837. An even larger labor movement in the 1860s collapsed in the Depression of 1873. It was only in the 1880s that a labor movement was established for good.

==Philadelphia, Pennsylvania==

The GTU of the City and County of Philadelphia was formed in 1834.

<doc id="98968" wikidata="Q105987" url="?curid=98968" title="Charles Boyer">
<text>Charles Boyer (; 28 August 1899 – 26 August 1978) was a French-American actor who appeared in more than 80 films between 1920 and 1976. After receiving an education in drama, Boyer started on the stage, but he found his success in American films during the 1930s. His memorable performances were among the era&#x27;s most highly praised, in romantic dramas such as &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; (1936), &quot;Algiers&quot; (1938), and &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939), as well as the mystery-thriller &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944). He received four Oscar nominations for Best Actor. He also appeared as himself on the CBS sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Boyer was born in Figeac, Lot, France, the son of Augustine Louise Durand and Maurice Boyer, a merchant. Boyer (whose surname comes from , the Occitan word for &quot;cowherd&quot;) was a shy small-town boy who discovered the movies and theatre at the age of eleven.

===Early acting career===
Boyer performed comic sketches for soldiers while working as a hospital orderly during World War I. He began studies briefly at the Sorbonne, and was waiting for a chance to study acting at the Paris Conservatory.

He went to the capital city to finish his education, but spent most of his time pursuing a theatrical career. In 1920, his quick memory won him a chance to replace the leading man in a stage production, &quot;Aux jardins de Murcie&quot;. He was successful. Then he appeared in a play &quot;La Bataille&quot; and Boyer became a theatre star overnight.

In the 1920s, he played charming and charismatic characters on both stage and in silent films.

===Early French films===
Boyer&#x27;s first film was &quot;L&#x27;homme du large&quot; (1920), directed by Marcel L&#x27;Herbier. He had roles in &quot;Chantelouve&quot; (1921), &quot;Le grillon du foyer&quot; (1922), and &quot;Esclave&quot; (1922).

At first, he performed film roles only for the money and found that supporting roles were unsatisfying. However, with the coming of sound, his deep voice made him a romantic star.

Boyer focused on theatre work for a number of years. He returned to the screen with &quot;Infernal Circle&quot; (1928), &quot;Captain Fracasse&quot; (1929), and &quot;La barcarolle d&#x27;amour&quot; (1930).

===Early trips to Hollywood===
Boyer was first brought to Hollywood by MGM who wanted him to play the Chester Morris part in a French version of &quot;The Big House&quot; (1930), &quot;Révolte dans la prison&quot; (1931).

Boyer had an offer from Paramount to appear in a small role in &quot;The Magnificent Lie&quot; (1931) with Ruth Chatterton, directed by Berthold Viertel. It was his first English speaking role.

He went back to MGM to make &quot;Le procès de Mary Dugan&quot; (1931), the French version of &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot; (1929). He did &quot;Tumultes&quot; (1932) for director Robert Siodmak.

Then he did the English-language &quot;The Man from Yesterday&quot; (1932) with Claudette Colbert at Paramount again directed by Viertel. He had a choice small role in Jean Harlow&#x27;s &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; (1932) at MGM.

===Return to France===

Boyer went back to France where he starred in &quot;F.P.1 Doesn&#x27;t Answer&quot; (1932), &quot;Moi et l&#x27;impératrice&quot; (1933), &quot;Les Amoureux&quot; (1933) (&quot;The Sparrowhawk&quot;), and &quot;La bataille&quot; (1933) with Annabella. The last was also filmed in an English-language version called &quot;The Battle,&quot; with Merle Oberon replacing Annabella and Boyer reprising his role.

He did &quot;The Only Girl&quot; (1933) with Lilian Harvey and performed on the Paris stage in &quot;Le Bonheur&quot; which was another success. It would be the last time he appeared on the Parisian stage.

He returned to Hollywood for &quot;Caravan&quot; (1934) with Loretta Young at Fox. He was also in the French-language version &quot;Caravane&quot;, again with Annabella.

Then in France he starred in &quot;Liliom&quot; (1934), directed by Fritz Lang, his first classic.

Boyer starred in some English language movies: &quot;Thunder in the East&quot; (1934).

In France he was in &quot;Le bonheur&quot; (1934), reprising his stage performance for director Marcel L&#x27;Herbier.

===Walter Wanger===

Boyer co-starred with Claudette Colbert in the psychiatric drama &quot;Private Worlds&quot; (1935) for Walter Wanger at Paramount. He signed a five-year contract with Wanger.

Then he romanced Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Break of Hearts&quot; (1935) for RKO, and Loretta Young in &quot;Shanghai&quot; (1935) for Wanger.

Boyer became an international star with &quot;Mayerling&quot; (1936), co-starring Danielle Darrieux and directed by Anatole Litvak. Boyer played Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria.

Back in Hollywood he was teamed with Marlene Dietrich in &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; (1936) for David O. Selznick. He and Dietrich were reunited on &quot;I Loved a Soldier&quot; (1936) for director Henry Hathaway at Paramount but the film was abandoned.

Boyer paired with Jean Arthur in &quot;History Is Made at Night&quot; (1937) for Wanger, and Greta Garbo in &quot;Conquest&quot; (1937) at MGM (where he played Napoleon Bonaparte). Boyer&#x27;s fee for the latter was $150,000 but with all the re-takes he wound up earning $450,000.

Boyer returned to France briefly to make &quot;Orage&quot; (1938), opposite Michèle Morgan for director Marc Allégret.

Back in Hollywood he had the lead in &quot;Tovarich&quot; (1937) with Claudette Colbert, directed by Litvak.

In 1938, he landed his famous role as Pepe le Moko, the thief on the run in &quot;Algiers&quot;, an English-language remake of the classic French film &quot;Pepe le Moko&quot; with Jean Gabin, produced by Wanger. Although in the movie Boyer never said to costar Hedy Lamarr &quot;Come with me to the Casbah,&quot; this line was in the movie trailer. The line would stick with him, thanks to generations of impressionists and Looney Tunes parodies. Boyer&#x27;s role as Pepe Le Moko was already world-famous when animator Chuck Jones based the character of Pepé Le Pew, the romantic skunk introduced in 1945, on Boyer and his best-known performance. Boyer&#x27;s vocal style was also parodied on the Tom and Jerry cartoons, most notably when Tom was trying to woo a female cat. (See &quot;The Zoot Cat&quot;).

Boyer made three films with Irene Dunne: &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939) at RKO, &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot; (1939) at Universal and &quot;Together Again&quot; (1944) at Columbia.

===World War II===

He went back to France to make &quot;Le corsaire&quot; (1939) for Marc Allégret. He was making the movie in Nice when France declared war on Germany in September 1939. Production ceased on the declaration of war. Boyer joined the French army. The film was never completed, although some footage of it was later released.

By November, Boyer was discharged from the army and back in Hollywood as the French government thought he would be of more service making films.

Boyer played in three classic film love stories: &quot;All This, and Heaven Too&quot; (1940) with Bette Davis, directed by Litvak at Warners; as the ruthless cad in &quot;Back Street&quot; (1941) with Margaret Sullavan, at Universal; and &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; (1941) with Olivia de Havilland and Paulette Goddard, at Paramount.

In contrast to his glamorous image, Boyer began losing his hair early, had a pronounced paunch, and was noticeably shorter than leading ladies like Ingrid Bergman. When Bette Davis first saw him on the set of &quot;All This, and Heaven Too&quot;, she did not recognize him and tried to have him removed.

===Universal===
In January 1942 Boyer signed a three-year contract with Universal to act and produce. The contract would cover nine films.

Before he started the contract he finished a film at Warners, &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1943) with Joan Fontaine.

Boyer was reunited with Sullavan in &quot;Appointment for Love&quot; (1942) at Universal and was one of many stars in &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (1942), directed by Julien Duvivier and &quot;Immortal France&quot; (1942). He became a US citizen in 1942.

He was one of many stars in &quot;Flesh and Fantasy&quot; (1943) which he also produced with Julien Duvivier at Universal. He was an uncredited producer on Duvivier&#x27;s &quot;Destiny&quot; (1944).

In 1943, he was awarded an Honorary Oscar Certificate for &quot;progressive cultural achievement&quot; in establishing the French Research Foundation in Los Angeles as a source of reference (certificate).

Boyer had one of his biggest hits with &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944) with Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten. He followed it with &quot;Together Again&quot; (1944) re-uniting with Irene Dunne; &quot;Congo&quot; (1944), a short; and &quot;Confidential Agent&quot; (1945) with Lauren Bacall, at Warners.

Boyer began his post war career with &quot;Cluny Brown&quot; (1946) with Jennifer Jones directed by Ernst Lubitsch. He was Warners highest paid actor at this stage earning $205,000 in 1945.

In 1947, he was the voice of Capt. Daniel Gregg in the Lux Radio Theater&#x27;s presentation of &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot;, played in the film by Rex Harrison. In 1948, he was made a &quot;chevalier&quot; of the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;. That year he did a thriller &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Vengeance&quot; (1948).

Another film he did with Bergman, &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; (1948), failed at the box office and Boyer was no longer the box office star he had been. &quot;If you are in a big flop, nobody wants you,&quot; he said later.

===Broadway===
Boyer went to Broadway, where he made his first appearance in &quot;Red Gloves&quot; (1948–49), based on Dirty Hands by Jean-Paul Sartre, which went for 113 performances.

In 1951, he appeared on the Broadway stage in one of his most notable roles, that of Don Juan, in a dramatic reading of the third act of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Man and Superman&quot;. This is the act popularly known as &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;. In 1952, he won Broadway&#x27;s 1951 Special Tony Award for &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;. It was directed by actor Charles Laughton. Laughton co-starred as the Devil, with Cedric Hardwicke as the statue of the military commander slain by Don Juan, and Agnes Moorehead as Dona Anna, the commander&#x27;s daughter, one of Juan&#x27;s former conquests. The production was a critical success, and was subsequently recorded complete by Columbia Masterworks, one of the first complete recordings of a non-musical stage production ever made. As of 2006, however, it has never been released on CD, but in 2009 it became available as an MP3 download.

Boyer did not abandon cinema: he had leading roles in &quot;The 13th Letter&quot; (1951), &quot;The First Legion&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Happy Time&quot; (1952). He had a character role in &quot;Thunder in the East&quot; (filmed 1951, released 1953) an Alan Ladd film.

===&quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;===

Boyer moved into television as one of the pioneering producers and stars of the anthology show &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot; (1952–56). It was made by Four Star Productions which would make Boyer and partners David Niven and Dick Powell rich.

Boyer returned to France to star in &quot;The Earrings of Madame de...&quot; (1953) for Max Ophüls alongside Darrieux. While there he was one of many names in &quot;Boum sur Paris&quot; (1953).

He returned to Broadway for Norman Krasna&#x27;s &quot;Kind Sir&quot; (1953–54) directed by Joshua Logan which ran for 166 performances. (In the film version, &quot;Indiscreet&quot; (1958), Cary Grant was cast in Boyer&#x27;s role.)

Back in Hollywood, Boyer had a support role in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Cobweb&quot; (1955).

He went back to France to star in &quot;Nana&quot; (1955) with Martine Carol and then to Italy for &quot;What a Woman!&quot; (1956) with Sophia Loren.

In 1956, Boyer was a guest star on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and had a cameo in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956). In France he had the lead in &quot;Paris, Palace Hotel&quot; (1956).

He appeared as the mystery guest on the 10 March 1957 episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

On 17 March 1957, Boyer starred in an adaptation for TV of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play, &quot;There Shall Be No Night&quot;, by Robert E. Sherwood. The performance starred Katharine Cornell, and was broadcast on NBC as part of the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;.

He appeared several times in &quot;Goodyear Theatre&quot; and &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot; on TV.

In France, Boyer was one of several stars in &quot;It Happened on the 36 Candles&quot; (1957) and he co-starred with Brigitte Bardot in &quot;La Parisienne&quot; (1957) and Michele Morgan in &quot;Maxime&quot; (1958), the latter directed by Henri Verneuil.

In Hollywood Boyer had a strong supporting role as real life privateer Dominique You alongside Yul Brynner&#x27;s Jean LaFitte in &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1958).

Boyer co-starred again with Claudette Colbert in the Broadway comedy &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; (1958–1960), but said to the producer, &quot;Keep that woman away from me&quot;. The production was a hit and ran for 431 performances. Boyer did not reprise his performance in the film version. He kept busy doing work for Four Star.

===1960s===

Onscreen, he continued in older roles: in &quot;Fanny&quot; (1961) starring Leslie Caron; &quot;Demons at Midnight&quot; (1961), in France, the lead; MGM&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (1962); &quot;Adorable Julia&quot; (1962) with Lilli Palmer; several episodes of &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;; and &quot;Love Is a Ball&quot; (1963).

He was nominated for the Tony Award as Best Actor (Dramatic) in the 1963 Broadway production of &quot;Lord Pengo&quot;, which ran for 175 performances.

Later that same year Boyer performed in &quot;Man and Boy&quot; on the London and New York stage. The Broadway run only went for 54 performances.

Boyer was reunited with David Niven in &quot;The Rogues&quot; (1964–65), a television series also starring Gig Young. Niven, Boyer and Young revolved from week to week as the episode&#x27;s leading man, sometimes appearing together, although most episodes wound up being helmed by Young since both Niven and Boyer had flourishing movie careers.

He had good support roles in &quot;A Very Special Favor&quot; (1965) with Rock Hudson; &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966) with Audrey Hepburn and Peter O&#x27;Toole; &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1967) with Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. He had cameos in &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966) and &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967) and was top billed in &quot;The Day the Hot Line Got Hot&quot; (1968).

His career had lasted longer than that of other romantic actors, winning him the nickname &quot;the last of the cinema&#x27;s great lovers.&quot; He recorded a laid-back album called &quot;Where Does Love Go&quot; in 1966. The album consisted of famous love songs sung (or rather spoken) with Boyer&#x27;s distinctive deep voice and French accent. The record was reportedly Elvis Presley&#x27;s favorite album for the last 11 years of his life, the one he most listened to.

Boyer supported in &quot;The April Fools&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; (1969) and guest starred on &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;.

===1970s===
Boyer&#x27;s son had died in 1965 and Boyer was finding it traumatic to continue living in Los Angeles so in March 1970 he decided to relocate to Europe.

Boyer&#x27;s final credits included the musical remake of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1973) and the French film &quot;Stavisky&quot; (1974), starring Jean-Paul Belmondo, the latter winning him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor, and also received the Special Tribute at Cannes Film Festival.

Boyer&#x27;s final performance was in &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; (1976) with Liza Minnelli and Ingrid Bergman, directed by Vincente Minnelli.

==Radio==
Boyer was the star of &quot;Hollywood Playhouse&quot; on NBC in the 1930s, but he left in 1939 &quot;for war service in France,&quot; returning on the 3 January 1940, broadcast. When he went on vacation in the summer of 1940, an item in a trade publication reported: &quot;It is an open secret that he doesn&#x27;t like the present policy of a different story and characters each week. Boyer would prefer a program in which he could develop a permanent characterization.&quot; Boyer would later star in his own radio show entitled &quot;Presenting Charles Boyer&quot; during 1950 over NBC.

==Personal life==

Boyer became a naturalized citizen of the United States on June 15, 1942, in Los Angeles.

In addition to French and English, Boyer spoke Italian, German, and Spanish.

Boyer was the husband of British actress Pat Paterson, whom he met at a dinner party in 1934. The two became engaged after two weeks of courtship and were married three months later. Later, they moved from Hollywood to Paradise Valley, Arizona. The marriage lasted 44 years until her death.

Boyer&#x27;s only child, Michael Charles Boyer (9 December 1943 – 23 September 1965), died by suicide at age 21, after separating from his girlfriend moments before.

==Suicide==
On 26 August 1978, Boyer died by suicide with an overdose of Seconal while at a friend&#x27;s home in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was taken to the hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, where he died, two days after his wife&#x27;s death from cancer, and two days before his own 79th birthday. He was interred in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California, alongside his wife and son.

==Awards==
Boyer never won an Oscar, though he was nominated for Best Actor four times in &quot;Conquest&quot; (1937), &quot;Algiers&quot; (1938), &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944) and &quot;Fanny&quot; (1961), the latter also winning him a nomination for the Laurel Awards for Top Male Dramatic Performance. He is particularly well known for &quot;Gaslight&quot; in which he played a thief/murderer who tries to convince his newlywed wife that she is going insane.

He was nominated for the Golden Globe as Best Actor for the 1952 film &quot;The Happy Time&quot;; and also nominated for the Emmy for Best Continuing Performance by an Actor in a Dramatic Series for his work in &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot; (1952–1956).

In 1960, Boyer was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star and a television star. Both stars are located at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="98969" wikidata="Q191045" url="?curid=98969" title="Felipe VI">
<text>Felipe VI (; Felipe Juan Pablo Alfonso de Todos los Santos de Borbón y Grecia; born 30 January 1968) is King of Spain since 19 June 2014. In accordance with the Spanish Constitution, as monarch, he is head of state and commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armed Forces, holding the military rank of captain general, and also plays the role of the supreme representation of Spain in international relations.

Felipe was born in Madrid during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco as the third child and only son of Prince Juan Carlos of Spain and Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark. Felipe was officially created Prince of Asturias in 1977, two years after his father became king. Felipe was formally proclaimed as prince in 1986. He was also made honorary soldier of the Spanish Army at the age of 9. Felipe was educated at Santa María de los Rosales School and went to Lakefield College School in Canada. Later, he studied law at the Autonomous University of Madrid and he obtained a Master of Science in Foreign Service degree from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

To prepare for his future role as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, Felipe joined the Spanish Army in 1985. During the next two years, he completed his military training in the Navy and Air Force. After completing his civil and military studies, he undertook official duties representing his father in different social and institutional events, such as chairing charity foundations or attending inaugurations of Latin American leaders. At one of these events with the press, Felipe met TV news journalist Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano, whom he married in 2004. They have two daughters, Leonor and Sofía.

Felipe ascended the throne on 19 June 2014 upon the abdication of his father. His reign has been marked by his condemnation of the Catalan independence referendum that led to the 2017–2018 constitutional crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and moves towards greater transparency in royal affairs. According to a poll conducted in 2020, Felipe has moderately high approval ratings.

==Early life and family==
Felipe was born at 12:45 (CET) on 30 January 1968, at Our Lady of Loreto Hospital at Madrid, being the third child and only son of Prince Juan Carlos of Spain and Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark. He was baptized on 8 February 1968 at the Palace of Zarzuela by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Madrid, Casimiro Morcillo, with water from the Jordan River. His full baptismal name, Felipe Juan Pablo Alfonso de Todos los Santos, consists of the names of the first Bourbon king of Spain (Felipe V), his grandfathers (Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, and King Paul of Greece), his great-grandfather Alfonso XIII of Spain, and &quot;de Todos los Santos&quot; (&quot;of all the Saints&quot;) as is customary among the Bourbons. 

His godparents were his paternal grandfather, the Count of Barcelona, and his paternal great-grandmother, Queen Victoria Eugenie. 

Shortly after his birth Felipe was styled &quot;infante&quot;. The dictator Francisco Franco died just over two months before Felipe&#x27;s eighth birthday, and Felipe&#x27;s father ascended the throne, as the latter had been appointed as Prince of Spain back in 1969. In his first official appearance, Felipe attended his father&#x27;s proclamation as king on 22 November 1975.

==Prince of Asturias==

In 1977, Felipe was formally proclaimed Prince of Asturias. In May, nine-year-old Felipe was made an honorary soldier of the 1st King&#x27;s Inmemorial Infantry Regiment. The occasion was marked on 28 May and was attended by the king, the prime minister and several other ministers in a ceremony at the infantry&#x27;s barracks. On 1 November the same year, he was ceremoniously paid homage as Prince of Asturias in Covadonga. In 1981 Felipe received the Collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece from his father, the Chief and Sovereign of the Order. On his 18th birthday on 30 January 1986, Felipe swore allegiance to the Constitution and to the King in the Spanish Parliament as required by the constitution, fully accepting his role as successor to the Crown.

In 1999, the construction began on a new royal residence near the Zarzuela Palace. This residence, known as the Prince&#x27;s Pavilion (), became Felipe&#x27;s private residence in the summer of 2002 and cost 4.23 million euros.

===Education and military training===

Felipe attended school at Santa María de los Rosales, which his daughters both attended. Felipe attended high school at Lakefield College School in Ontario, Canada, and studied at the Autonomous University of Madrid, where he graduated with a degree in law; he also completed several courses in economics. He completed his academic studies by obtaining a Master of Science in Foreign Service degree from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he was the roommate of his cousin, Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece.

As the heir to the throne, a carefully regulated and structured plan was laid out for Felipe&#x27;s military training. In August 1985, a Royal Decree named Felipe as officer at the General Military Academy in Zaragoza. He began his military training there in September. He completed the first phase of his formation in October. In July 1986, he was promoted to Cadet Ensign. He was also named as Midshipman. In September 1986, he began his naval training at the Naval Military Academy in Marin (Pontevedra), joining the Third Brigade. In January 1987, he continued his naval training on board the training ship &quot;Juan Sebastián Elcano&quot;.

In July, he was named as Student Ensign at the General Air Academy in Murcia. In September 1987, he began his air force training there where he learned to fly aircraft. In 1989, he was promoted to lieutenant in the Army, ensign in the Navy, and lieutenant in the Air Force. In 1992, he was promoted to captain in the Air Force. In 1993, he was promoted to lieutenant in the Navy and captain in the Infantry of the Army.

Further promotions in 2000 were commandant in the Army, corvette captain in the Navy, and commandant in the Air Force. Promotions in 2009 were lieutenant colonel in the Army, frigate captain in the Navy, and lieutenant colonel in the Air Force.

Since 19 June 2014, after his ascension to the throne, he acquired the rank of Captain General (Commander-in-chief) of all the Spanish armies (Army, Navy and Air Force). During the 2016 Pascua Militar, the Chief of the Defence Staff, Fernando García Sánchez, on behalf of the Armed Forces, gifted the monarch with a personalized command baton, which symbolizes the loyalty of the armies to the king and the command he has over them. The piece, made by some jewelers from León, is made of cherry wood and the tips are adorned with silver pieces.

Felipe speaks Spanish, Catalan, French, English and some Greek.

===Participation in the Olympics===
Felipe was a member of the Spanish Olympic sailing team at the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona. Felipe took part in the opening ceremony as the Spanish team&#x27;s flag bearer. The Spanish crew finished in sixth place in the Soling class and obtained an Olympic diploma. He is an honorary member of the International Soling Association. Both his mother and uncle, King Constantine II of Greece, were on the Greek sailing team at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome (his mother as a substitute), and Felipe&#x27;s father and sister were also Olympic sailors for Spain.

===Marriage and children===
Felipe&#x27;s bachelor years were a source of interest to the Spanish press for several years. His name was linked with several eligible women, but only two notable girlfriends: Spanish noblewoman Isabel Sartorius, around 1989 to 1991, daughter of the Marquess of Mariño, who was viewed unfavorably by the Royal Family due to her mother&#x27;s cocaine addiction, and Norwegian model Eva Sannum, who modeled underwear.

Although there were some engagement rumors in the previous weeks, on 31 October 2003, a TV program called &quot;Con T de Tarde&quot; announced unexpectedly that the Prince of Asturias was dating Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano, a television journalist who had been married previously. The following day, the Royal Household made official their engagement. According to the Royal House, they met in late 2002. The official hand petition was made on 6 November 2003 at the Royal Palace of El Pardo. Felipe proposed with a 16-carat diamond engagement ring with a white gold trim and gifted her with a pearl and sapphire necklace. Ortiz marked the occasion by giving him white gold and sapphire cufflinks and a classic book, &quot;El doncel de don Enrique el doliente&quot; by Mariano José de Larra.

The wedding, which was officiated by the archbishop of Madrid and president of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, Antonio María Rouco Varela, took place on the morning of 22 May 2004 in the Almudena Cathedral, with representatives of royal families from all over the world and most heads of state from Latin America present. In Spain alone, the royal wedding was watched by more than 25 million viewers, the most watched television event in the history of Spanish television.

Felipe and Letizia have two daughters: Leonor, Princess of Asturias (born 31 October 2005) and Infanta Sofía (born 29 April 2007). Both were born at Ruber International Hospital in Madrid.

===Activities in Spain and abroad===
Felipe undertook his constitutional duties as heir to the throne, hosting many official events in Spain and participating in all events of different sectors and aspects of Spanish public life. Since October 1995, Felipe has represented the Crown on a series of official visits to the Spanish regions, starting with Valencia. Felipe has held regular meetings with constitutional bodies and state institutions keeping up-to-date with their activities. He also attends meetings of the various bodies of the General State Administration and of the Autonomous Communities Administrations as required by his national and international constitutional obligations. In particular, he has held meetings with people of his generation who have built successful careers in political, economic, cultural and media circles. As part of his military training, Felipe trained as a military helicopter pilot. On occasions when King Juan Carlos I was unable to attend, Felipe presided over the annual presentation of dispatches to officers and non-commissioned officers in the Armed Forces as well as participating in military exercises held by the three Armed Services.

Since January 1996, Felipe has represented Spain at many Latin American presidents&#x27; inauguration ceremonies. As Prince, he visited every country in Latin America except Cuba, which he visited as King in 11–14 November 2019. He made over 200 foreign trips in total.

Felipe has also played an active role in promoting Spain&#x27;s economic, commercial and cultural interests and the Spanish language abroad. He frequently represents Spain at world economic and trade events (e.g. Expotecnia, Expoconsumo, and Expohabitat), and is especially interested in promoting the creation of Centres and University Chairs to advance the study of Spain both historically and in the present-day at major foreign universities.

Following the March 2004 Madrid bombings, Felipe, along with his sisters Elena and Cristina, took part in a public demonstration.

===Social activities===

In addition to his official activities, Felipe serves as honorary president of several associations and foundations, such as the Codespa Foundation, which finances economic and social development in Ibero-America and other countries, and the Spanish branch of the Association of European Journalists, comprising outstanding communications professionals. Most noteworthy is the Prince of Asturias Foundation, where he presides annually at the international awards ceremony of the highly prestigious Princess of Asturias Awards (formerly the Prince of Asturias Awards).

Felipe was appointed a &quot;UN-Eminent Person&quot; by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2001, during its &quot;International Year of Volunteers&quot;, and continues to make contributions internationally towards enhancing the importance of voluntary work.

Felipe is a member of the Sons of the American Revolution due to his patriot ancestor Charles III of Spain. 

==Reign==
===Accession===
On 2 June 2014, King Juan Carlos announced his intent to abdicate in Felipe&#x27;s favor. As required by the Constitution of Spain, the Council of Ministers began deliberations the following day on an organic law to give effect to the abdication. The law had to be passed by a majority of all members of the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the &quot;Cortes Generales&quot;. According to Jesús Posada, the president of the Congress of Deputies, Felipe could be proclaimed king as early as 18 June. On 4 June, &quot;El País&quot; of Madrid reported that Felipe would indeed be proclaimed king on 18 June.

Felipe ascended the throne at the stroke of midnight on 19 June; his father had given his sanction to the organic law effecting his abdication just hours earlier. The next morning, after receiving the Captain General&#x27;s sash from his father (symbolizing the transfer of royal and military power), he was formally sworn in and proclaimed king in a low-key ceremony held in the Cortes. He swore to uphold the Constitution before formally being proclaimed king by Posada. Upon his accession, he became the youngest monarch in Europe, being nine months younger than King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.

As king, Felipe has fairly extensive reserve powers on paper. He is the guardian of the Constitution and is responsible for ensuring it is obeyed and followed. It was expected that he would follow his father&#x27;s practice of taking a mostly ceremonial and representative role, acting largely on the advice of the government. He indicated as much in a speech to the Cortes on the day of his enthronement, saying that he would be &quot;a loyal head of state who is ready to listen and understand, warn and advise as well as to defend the public interest at all times&quot;. While he is nominally chief executive, he is not politically responsible for exercising his powers. Per the Constitution, his acts are not valid unless countersigned by a minister, who then assumes political responsibility for the act in question.

A poll conducted by &quot;El País&quot;, however, indicates that a majority of Spaniards wish Felipe would play a greater role in politics, with 75% of the 600 people surveyed stating they would approve if he personally pushed the political parties to reach agreements on national problems. According to an &quot;El Mundo&quot; newspaper poll, Felipe had a greater approval than his father prior to his reign.

On 23 June 2014, he appointed his private secretary since 1995, Jaime Alfonsín, as Private Secretary to the King. Two days later, he also appointed José Manuel de Zuleta y Alejandro, 14th duke of Abrantes, as Private Secretary to the Queen.

On 18 July, the new king chaired his first meeting of the Council of Ministers.

===Household reforms===
During his ascension speech, Felipe pledged a &quot;renewed monarchy for a new time&quot;. A few days later after this, Felipe and Letizia became the first Spanish monarchs to receive and recognize LGBT organisations at the Palace. Felipe also changed the protocol in order to allow people to take the oath of office without a crucifix or Bible. This did not mean, in any way, a change in his relations with the Catholic Church or religion, in fact, on their first overseas trip as king and queen, Felipe VI and Letizia met Pope Francis in the Apostolic Palace on 30 June 2014. They subsequently met with Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin and Under-Secretary for Relations with States Antoine Camilleri. The visit followed one by King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía on 28 April.

The king also established a difference between the royal family and the King&#x27;s family, leaving his sisters and their descendants outside the royal family and, therefore, not carrying out institutional representation of the Crown (although they do it occasionally). In July 2014, the king banned the royal family from working outside the Royal Household and he established an external audit made by the Office of the Comptroller General of the State.

Following orders from the king, since 1 January 2015, the Spanish royal family cannot accept &quot;expensive gifts&quot; when &quot;they exceed social or courtesy uses&quot;. In February 2015, Felipe announced he would cut his annual salary by 20% as a result of the economic recession and hardships continuing to hamper Spain.

In June 2015, Felipe VI stripped his sister, Infanta Cristina, of her royal title of Duchess of Palma de Mallorca, after the tax fraud allegations surrounding her and her husband, Iñaki Urdangarín. While her husband was eventually sentenced to six years in prison, she was acquitted of all charges.

In 2017, the Crown opened for the first time the gardens of the royal family&#x27;s vacation palace, the Marivent Palace, at the request of the regional government of the Balearic Islands. The public can enjoy the gardens as long as the royal family is not there.

In February 2024, the king appointed a new Private Secretary, diplomat Camilo Villarino, at that time Head of the Cabinet of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell. Villarino replaced Jaime Alfonsín, private secretary to Felipe for almost 30 years, both as prince and king. Alfonsin remains in the Household as private counselor. Likewise, in April 2024 the king appointed a new private secretary to the Queen, State lawyer María Dolores Ocaña Madrid, replacing the duke of Abrantes. At the end of 2024, the king concluded the renewal of the senior positions of his Household, appointing two other women to relevant positions. On the one hand, parliamentary clerk Mercedes Araújo Díaz de Terán was appointed Secretary-General and diplomat Mercedes Araújo Díaz de Terán was appointed as Diplomatic Counselor.

==== 2020 royal finances controversy ====
On 15 March 2020, following the revelation in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Felipe VI appeared as second beneficiary (after his father) of the Lucum Foundation, the entity on the receiving end of a €65 million donation by Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, King of Saudi Arabia, the Royal Household issued a statement declaring (a) that Felipe VI would renounce any inheritance from his father to which he could be entitled, and (b) that Juan Carlos would lose his public stipend from the part of the General State Budget dedicated to the Royal Household. The renunciation of the inheritance is a mere declaration of intent, since the Spanish Civil Code prevents accepting or rejecting an inheritance until the death of the person who bequeaths takes place. The Royal Household also implied that Felipe VI already had prior knowledge of the Lucum Foundation and his condition as beneficiary of the latter since April 2019.

After this controversy, in April 2022 the Council of Ministers approved a Royal Decree elaborated by the Royal Household that puts the King&#x27;s house completely under the 2013 Transparency Act and the 2015 Senior Officials Act. This implies, on the one hand, a greater control of the Crown&#x27;s finances, since the Court of Auditors will be able to audit its accounts; on the other hand, the disclosure of the wealth of the king and of the senior officials of the Household.

On 25 April 2022, in a move towards greater transparency, Felipe VI made public his personal assets for the first time, revealing them to be valued at 2.6 million euros (US$2.8 million). The Spanish royal palace stated that his wealth is in savings, current accounts and securities, as well as art, antiques and jewelry; and that he has no real estate or financial dealings abroad. It also noted that Felipe VI had paid tax on all his financial earnings. This amount makes him one of the least wealthy monarchs in the world, despite previous estimates of his father Juan Carlos I&#x27;s wealth being estimated between $2–2.3 billion.

=== National politics ===

==== Dissolution of Parliament ====

The elections in 2015 resulted in no party winning enough seats to form a government. No agreements with the different parties were successful. After months of talks with the different party leaders, and with there being no apparent candidate in a position of support in forming a government, the king issued a royal decree dissolving parliament with new elections being called in June. This marked the first time since the transition to democracy that an election was called under Article 99.5 of the Constitution, wherein the initiative for issuing the dissolution of the Cortes belonged to the King and not to the Prime Minister.

After the second elections, some socialist MPs abstained in order to make it easy for the conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to form a new government. The king swore in the new cabinet on 4 November 2016.

==== Catalan independence referendum ====
On 3 October 2017, as huge protest rallies and a general strike took place in Catalonia following the 2017 Catalan independence referendum that was deemed illegal by Spanish authorities, Felipe delivered an unusually strongly worded televised address, watched by more than 12 million people across the country, in which he condemned the actions of the referendum organizers for acting &quot;outside the law&quot;, accusing them of &quot;unacceptable disloyalty&quot; and of &quot;eroding the harmony and co-existence within Catalan society itself&quot;. He also warned the referendum could put the economy of the entire north-east region of Spain at risk.

Reactions to Felipe&#x27;s speech were mixed. Party officials from the PP, PSOE and Ciudadanos acclaimed the King&#x27;s &quot;commitment to legality&quot; and the &quot;defense of the Constitution, the [regional] Statute, the rule of law and the territorial integrity of Spain&quot;, whereas leaders from Unidos Podemos and Catalunya en Comú criticized it as &quot;as unworthy as it was irresponsible&quot;, paving the way for a harsh intervention of the Catalan autonomy. However, some PSOE leaders were upset that the King had not made any call to understanding or dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments.

After the speech, where Felipe ordered the &quot;legitimate powers of the State&quot; to ensure &quot;constitutional order&quot;, the Spanish government started the process to apply article 155 of the Constitution, which gives special powers to the central government to intervene in a Spanish region. On 27 October 2017, the Spanish Senate approved government proposal to impose direct rule in the region with the support of conservative and socialist votes. The Spanish government dismissed all Catalan authorities, dissolved the regional parliament and called for early elections in 2017.

==== Conservative government fall and political instability ====
 In May 2018, the Audiencia Nacional issued a ruling finding the ruling party, People&#x27;s Party, guilty as beneficiary of some corruption cases. The left-wing opposition, led by socialist Pedro Sánchez, called for a vote of no confidence against the conservative prime minister. The Congress of Deputies approved the motion on 1 June 2018, and the King appointed Sánchez as new prime minister on 2 June. The socialist minority government lasted for a year and a half, and fell in February 2019 after the government failed to pass the budget.

Although the Socialists won the April 2019 general election, the political scenario was left wide open. The socialist prime minister refused to agree with the leaders of left-wing populist Podemos, and the King dissolved Parliament. The November general election had the same result as in April, so the prime minister agreed to a coalition. Felipe swore in the new coalition cabinet on 13 January 2020.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====

On 18 March 2020, a widespread &quot;cacerolada&quot; from the balconies of some cities across Spain took place, in an attempt to counter-program the TV discourse of Felipe VI on the COVID-19 pandemic in that country. The intent was to force Juan Carlos I to donate to public healthcare the €100M he had allegedly obtained through kickbacks from Saudi Arabia, which was ultimately dismissed. Despite the attempt to boycott the speech, it was seen by more than 15 million citizens, making it the most watched speech by a monarch in the history of Spain. In July, he led a memorial paying tribute to victims of the pandemic at the Royal Palace.

In December 2021, Felipe VI warned against virus complacency during the pandemic, stating that &quot;the risk has not disappeared.&quot;

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, King Felipe had to isolate himself in quarantine for testing positive for coronavirus on several occasions between 2020 and 2022. While he was isolated, Queen Letizia replaced him in those events for which she was constitutionally authorized (awards delivery, lunches, event openings, etc.) but not in those activities tightly related to constitutional responsibilities (such as the working meeting with the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Željko Komšić, in 2022, which had to be postponed).

==== 2023 Spanish general election and third Sánchez government ====
The coalition government formed in 2020 led to almost a complete legislature of stability, however, in May 2023, local and regional elections were held. The result of these elections could not have been worse for the government; although the Socialist Party held up well, losing just 400,000 votes compared to the 2019 regional and local elections, the parties to its left collapsed and, in many regions and cities, disappeared, causing the Socialists to lose most of their regional and local power.

After this disastrous result, the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, requested the king to dissolve Parliament and call early elections with the aim of &quot;clarifying the [will of the] Spanish people about the political forces that should lead this new phase and the policies to be applied&quot;. As happened in the regional and local elections, the People&#x27;s Party led by Alberto Núñez Feijóo won the election, but he fell short of a majority to form a new conservative government. In general, this was considered a victory for Sánchez, who still had a chance to renew its coalition government.

After meeting with political parties represented in parliament, and after verifying that neither Sánchez nor Núñez Feijóo had a sufficient majority to form a government, on 22 August 2023 the king asked the winner of the elections, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, to form a government. As expected, Núñez Feijóo failed to gather enough support to govern and the Congress of Deputies rejected his candidacy. Following new meetings with political parties on early October, the king nominated acting prime minister Pedro Sánchez. After obtaining the support of Sumar and the pro-independence and regionalist political parties, the Congress of Deputies re-elected Sánchez on 16 November 2023 and the king swore in the new cabinet on 21 November 2023.

On 3 November 2024, King Felipe, Queen Letizia, Prime Minister Sánchez and Valencian president Carlos Mazón were violently confronted during a meeting with victims of the October 2024 Spain floods in Paiporta in the Valencian Community, who threw mud and objects at them and injured two bodyguards. Although the Prime Minister had to be evacuated, the monarchs remained there listening to the complaints and requests of the residents. After the incident, the visit to neighboring towns was postponed, but the Royal Household confirmed that they would return &quot;in the next few days&quot;. The king returned to the region on November 12 to check the efforts of the Armed Forces in the disaster and, in November 19, the monarchs resumed the visit canceled two weeks earlier.

===10th accession anniversary===

In 2024 Felipe marked his 10th anniversary of his accession and, for this occasion, the king renewed his motto: &quot;Servicio, compromiso y deber&quot; (English: &quot;Service, commitment and duty&quot;). As was customary during his reign, it was announced that the events to celebrate this anniversary would be discreet.

The celebrations began in the Royal Palace, when the royal family presided, from the interior balcony of the palace, over the Royal Guard changing. Subsequently, and after greeting the citizens who approached the palace, the king presented the Order of Civil Merit to 19 anonymous citizens, each from a Spanish region, as well as from the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. This event ended with a lunch for the invited authorities and the recipients. Before the start of lunch, the Princess of Asturias and Infanta Sofía surprised the king with an improvised speech to congratulate him on the anniversary.

In the afternoon, the monarch&#x27;s daughters visited the Royal Collections Gallery with 40 young people who, at some point, won the contest &quot;What is a King to you?&quot;, organized annually by the Royal Household and two private foundations that promotes the monarchy. On this occasion, the monarchs surprised the attendees by attending the event when it was not planned.

To conclude the celebrations, public concerts were held in the Royal Palace, including one of the violinist Ara Malikian, as well as a projection of images on the façade of the palace attended by the royal family.

=== Sports ===

Felipe is a huge fan of sports and has attended hundreds of sports events since 1976, when he accompanied his father to a match between Real Madrid and Atlético de Madrid at the 1976 Copa del Generalísimo final. At the end of the event, when asked by journalist about his favourite team, he said Atlético de Madrid. He is also the club&#x27;s honorary president since 2003. Besides football, he loves skiing, squash and sailing.

As King of Spain, most of the sports have a tournament in his honor, &quot;Copa del Rey&quot; (), which he normally attends and delivers the trophy to the winner. Also, since the reign of Alfonso XIII (1886–1931), the King exercises high patronage over the sports federations. Most of them hold the title of &quot;royal&quot; granted by the ruling monarch; the latest federation to receive this honor was the Rugby Federation in 2023.

It is also common for him to attend international sporting events in which Spanish clubs or Spanish national teams participate. If he cannot attend, it is common for him to be replaced by a member of the royal family, such as Leonor, Princess of Asturias and Infanta Sofía in the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 or Queen Letizia in the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup final.

=== 2017 terrorist attacks ===

=== International agenda ===

Since his proclamation as king on 19 June 2014, Felipe VI has visited, , 57 sovereign countries on four continents, in 129 official visits abroad (The number of countries includes Puerto Rico, which has the status of &quot;Commonwealth of the United States&quot;). The first international trip was to the Vatican City on 30 June 2014, to meet with the Pope. The last one was to Montevideo, Uruguay, on 28 February–1 March 2025, to attend the inauguration of Yamandú Orsi as president of Uruguay.

Most of his visits have been to European countries (22 countries in 71 visits), followed by American countries (19 countries in 36 visits), Asian (12 countries in 16 visits) and African (4 countries in 5 visits). He has never visited an Oceanian country as a king; as prince of Asturias, he visited Australia and New Zealand in 1990.

==== Ibero-America ====

Like his father did, Felipe VI has maintained an important presence and influence in the countries of Latin America, Portugal and Brazil. As King of Spain, he represents Spain in all the Ibero-American Summits, normally calling for the &quot;unity&quot; of the region and the strengthening of relations with Spain and the European Union. In this sense, Spain is also the main contributor to the Ibero-American General Secretariat, headquartered in Madrid. This organization is mainly financed by Spain, with more than 60 per cent of the budget as of 2016. Felipe VI has attended all the summits since he ascended the throne. For the 2021 Ibero-American summit in Andorra la Vella, Felipe became the first Spanish monarch to visit neighbouring Andorra, a principality whose co-prince is the Spanish Bishop of Urgell.

Also, as he did as prince of Asturias, Felipe has kept the tradition of attending the inauguration of Latin American leaders. As of January 2024, he has attended more than 80 presidential inaugurations.

===== Portugal =====

During the reign of Felipe VI, good relations between Spain and Portugal have continued. After his visit to the Vatican, Felipe dedicated his second foreign visit to Portugal, in July 2015. There, he met with President Aníbal Cavaco Silva and Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, and stated that the relationship between the two countries was &quot;not only the relationship of good neighbors, but of brother countries&quot; and remembered that his grandfather, Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, chose Portugal to live while in exile. He also made it clear that he intended to keep the good relationship between the neighbor countries.

After the election of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as new president of Portugal, he made his first official visit to a foreign country to Spain in March 2016. The king, who had attended the inauguration of Rebelo de Sousa early that month, and the Portuguese leader, had established a very good relationship, being described as a true friendship. In addition to courtesy and institutional visits, it is very common to see both leaders in each other&#x27;s countries as well as attending various events led by the other. Examples of this good relationship are the support that the Portuguese president gave to the king when the monarch was awarded with the World Peace &amp; Liberty Award from the World Association of Jurists in 2018, the private visit that Rebelo de Sousa made to Spain in 2020 to visit the Prado Museum, and having a private lunch with the monarch at Zarzuela Palace, as well as in 2021, when they were seen eating on a public terrace near the Royal Palace of Madrid.

===== Cuba =====
From 11 to 14 November 2019, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the founding of the city of Havana by the Spanish, Felipe and Letizia made a state visit to Cuba. This was the fifth royal visit to the island after Infanta Eulalia, Duchess of Galliera in 1893, Infante Alfonso, Count of Covadonga in 1937, Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona in 1948 and King Juan Carlos in 1999. However, King Felipe&#x27;s visit was the first state visit in history. The visit was harshly criticized by the conservative opposition, as well as by the Cuban opposition and human rights associations which considered the visit a legitimization of the regime.

The Spanish monarchs, who were greeted with cheers by the Cubans, were also welcomed by Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel and his wife, Lis Cuesta Peraza. After signing some cooperation agreements and receiving the baton of the city, the royal couple walked through the streets of the Cuban capital and visit the most relevant monuments and buildings. The next day, King Felipe awarded Eusebio Leal with the Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III, a relevant Cuban historian who already held the grand crosses of the orders of Alfonso X, the Wise and Isabella the Catholic.

To conclude the trip, the monarchs traveled to Santiago de Cuba and visited the Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca, where they paid homage to the fallen in the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898) and Spanish–American War of 1898.

===== Mexico =====

Felipe has had a good relationship with Mexico, coinciding in his first years of reign with president Enrique Peña Nieto, who favored this relationships. Felipe made a state visit to the North American country in 2015. However, things got worse with the rise to power of Andrés Manuel López Obrador. López Obrador was inaugurated as Mexican president in December 2018, an inauguration attended by the King, and from the beginning, the Mexican president showed rejection of what Spain and its companies represented.

At the beginning of 2019, the Mexican president asked Felipe VI for an apology on behalf of the Crown and of Spain for the events that occurred during the Spanish conquest of the Americas. The Royal Household did not respond to this request, forwarding the letter from the Mexican president to the Government. In a release, the Spanish government &quot;firmly rejected&quot; López Obrador&#x27;s arguments and encouraged both governments to &quot;work together&quot; to &quot;intensify the already existing relations of friendship and cooperation&quot;. This request for an apology and the criticism for not answering has been reiterated by the Mexican president on various occasions between 2020 and 2022.

After this incident, neither the Royal Family nor the King&#x27;s Household have spoken about the issue or intervened in any way in the relations between Spain and Mexico, leaving it in the hands of the Government.

In 2024, incoming Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum officially banned Felipe VI from attending her inauguration on 1 October, citing his failure to respond to López Obrador&#x27;s letter. In response, the Spanish government said that it would boycott the event altogether.

==== Gibraltar ====

As King of Spain, Felipe has defended the historic claim of Spain over Gibraltar. In September 2014, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time and, although he made some reference to the territorial integrity of the states, he did not directly mention Gibraltar.

Two years later, in another speech at the UN General Assembly podium, the king referred to Gibraltar as the &quot;only existing colony in European territory&quot; and he invited the UK to &quot;put an end to this anachronism with a agreed solution between our two countries that restores the territorial integrity of Spain and is beneficial for the population of the colony and Campo de Gibraltar&quot;.

The last time the King mentioned the Gibraltar dispute was on his state visit to the United Kingdom.

=====State trip to the UK=====
From 12 to 14 July 2017, the King and Queen of Spain made a state visit to the United Kingdom, which had been postponed twice: the first in March 2016, due to the political crisis in Spain and the second in May 2017, due to the snap general election in Britain.

On Wednesday morning the 12th, Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, came to receive the King and Queen. From there, they proceeded to Horse Guards Parade, where they were officially received by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, with military honours and ordnance salutes. The hymns of the two countries were played and the King reviewed the Guard formed there. Next, they moved to Buckingham Palace where they visited the Picture Gallery. In the afternoon Felipe went to the Parliament of the United Kingdom where he addressed a few words at the joint session and held an informal meeting with the leader of the Labour opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. During his speech before parliament, he mentioned the status of Gibraltar, saying that &quot;I am certain that this resolve to overcome our differences will be even greater in the case of Gibraltar, and I am confident that through the necessary dialogue and effort our two governments will be able to work towards arrangements that are acceptable to all involved&quot;. In the evening, the State Dinner, hosted by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in honor of the King and Queen of Spain, took place in the Gala Hall of Buckingham Palace.

On Thursday the 13th, there was a Spanish-British business meeting (UK-SPAIN Business Forum) at Mansion House, with the presence of the Mayor of the City of London, Andrew Parmley, and an important business delegation from both countries. Later, the party visited Westminster Abbey accompanied by Prince Harry. There, the King made an offering at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. At mid-morning, they went to the Spanish Embassy in London, where they received representatives of the Spanish community in the capital and where, previously, they had held a brief meeting with the families of Ignacio Echeverría and Aysha Frade, murdered in the terrorist attacks in London. Later, the King visited 10 Downing Street, where he had a working lunch with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, in which they discussed matters of bilateral interest. Thursday&#x27;s day was completed with a gala dinner offered by the Mayor of London in honor of the King and Queen, at Guildhall.

On Friday the 14th, Felipe and Letizia were officially bid farewell by Elizabeth and Philip, at the gates of Buckingham Palace. Subsequently, Felipe and Letizia moved to the Francis Crick Institute, a biomedical research center that houses the largest individual biomedical laboratory in Europe. Later they went to Oxford to visit the Weston Library, where they were shown a manuscript of the Codex Mendoza, they saw a copy of a Ptolemy, with the coat of arms of the Catholic Monarchs and an original copy of a first edition of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. At noon, Oxford University hosted a luncheon in his honour. To conclude, they held a meeting at Exeter College with representatives of the university&#x27;s academic community, including professors, postgraduate students and doctoral students linked to Spain.

=== Jews ===

Felipe, like his father before him, has supported the initiatives of Spanish institutions to normalize relations with the Jewish people and religion. In 1990, he awarded the Sephardic Jews communities with the Prince of Asturias Award.

In December 2015, the King hosted a solemn ceremony in the Royal Palace to celebrate the approval by the Cortes and the subsequent sanction by the Sovereign of the law that granted Spanish nationality to the Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 due to the Alhambra Decree. At his speech, Felipe thanked the Sephardic Jews for preserving their language, &quot;Ladino&quot;, and for teaching their own children &quot;to love this Spanish homeland&quot;. He also welcomed them &quot;back home&quot;, adding that they had &quot;returned home forever.&quot; The Jewish associations thanked the gesture, declaring that they were no longer &quot;Spaniards without a homeland.&quot;

In January 2020, the King attended the Fifth World Holocaust Forum at Jerusalem. Felipe, who claims the title of King of Jerusalem as one of the historic titles of the Spanish crown, was the only international leader to speak at the opening dinner. In his speech, he stated that &quot;there is no room for indifference in the face of racism, xenophobia, hatred and antisemitism&quot; and that &quot;forgetting the Holocaust would be extremely dangerous and an utter disrespect to the memory of the victims.&quot;

On 9 October 2023, King Felipe condemned &quot;with all firmness&quot; the Hamas-led attack on Israel, called for &quot;doing everything possible to avoid greater suffering, destruction, hopelessness and the loss of more human lives&quot; and affirmed that Spain &quot;remains faithful to its commitment to peace and stability in the region&quot;. Later that month, during the 2023 Princess of Asturias Awards ceremony, Felipe referred to the ongoing conflict asking for unity to resolve it and recalled that in 1994, Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat received the Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation for their &quot;effort to create conditions of peace in the region&quot; after the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the 1994 Oslo I Accord. On 11 January 2024, the King, in a meeting with the diplomatic corps in Spain, called for the release of war hostages and defended the &quot;establishment of the Palestinian State next to Israel&quot; to stop the &quot;cycle of violence&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
In 2019, as King, Felipe received the World Peace &amp; Liberty Award from the World Jurist Association at the World Law Congress in Madrid.

==Titles, styles and arms==
===Titles and styles ===
Juan Carlos became King in late November 1975, but no title was conferred on Felipe as heir apparent until 1977, when he was created Prince of Asturias, the traditional title normally held by the heir to the Spanish throne. The royal decree granting him this title also entitled him to use &quot;the other historical titles corresponding to the heir of the Crown&quot;. Felipe started using the Aragonese title of Prince of Girona publicly on 21 April 1990, during a trip around Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia, becoming the first Bourbon to use this title.

Upon ascending the throne, Felipe assumed the same titles held by his father. If the former Kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre had separate naming styles, he would also be known as Felipe V of Aragon and Felipe VIII of Navarre along with Felipe VI of Castile.

===Arms===

As heir to the Spanish throne, Felipe&#x27;s arms were the Spanish coat of arms with a label of three points azure (blue). The first quarter represents Castile, the second León, the third Aragon, and the fourth Navarre; below are the arms of Granada. In the centre, on an inescutcheon, were the ancestral arms of the sovereign House of Bourbon-Anjou. Surrounding the shield was the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece and surmounting it was the heraldic crown of the heir to the throne, decorated with four half-arches.

Following his accession to the throne, the label on his arms was removed and the crown of the heir was changed to that of the monarch&#x27;s (eight half-arches instead of four). These arms differ from those of his father&#x27;s as king, as they omit the Cross of Burgundy, the yoke, and the sheaf of five arrows.

<doc id="98970" wikidata="Q311669" url="?curid=98970" title="Shoko Asahara">
<text>, born , was the founder and leader of the Japanese doomsday cult known as Aum Shinrikyo. He was convicted of masterminding the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, and was also involved in several other crimes. Asahara was sentenced to death in 2004, and his final appeal failed in 2011. In June 2012, his execution was postponed due to further arrests of Aum members. He was ultimately executed along with other senior members of Aum Shinrikyo on July 6, 2018.

== Early life ==
Chizuo Matsumoto was born on March 2, 1955, the fourth son of a large, poor family of tatami-mat-makers in Kumamoto Prefecture. He had infantile glaucoma from birth, which made him lose all sight in his left eye and go partially blind in his right eye at a young age, and was thus enrolled in a school for the blind when he was 6 years old since he could not continue the family trade; he never lived with his family again. 

Matsumoto discovered a way to earn money by directing other kids to a candy store, and as he was the only student in the school still capable of having some vision, this led to him becoming somewhat well-liked. However, Matsumoto was also known to be a bully at the school, taking advantage of the other students by beating them and extorting money from them. During his adolescence, Matsumoto developed a fantasy about ruling a kingdom of robots with total power and confided in his schoolmates about his aspiration to rule Japan as Prime Minister. 

He graduated in 1973 and applied to study politics at Tokyo University, but was rejected. He then turned to the study of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, which were common careers for the blind in Japan, and he established a Chinese medicine shop outside Tokyo. Asahara married the following year and eventually fathered six children, the eldest of whom was born in 1978. In 1981, Matsumoto was convicted of practicing pharmacy without a license and selling unregulated drugs, for which he was fined ¥200,000 (equivalent to about ¥270,000 in 2023).

Matsumoto&#x27;s interest in religion reportedly started at this time. Having been recently married, he worked to support his large and growing family. He dedicated his free time to the study of various religious concepts, starting with Chinese astrology and Taoism. Later, Asahara practiced Western esotericism, yoga, meditation, esoteric Buddhism, and esoteric Christianity. Matsumoto let his hair and beard grow and adopted the name Shoko Asahara. 

Starting in 1984, Asahara made several pilgrimages to India, where he met Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama. Asahara later claimed to his followers that he managed to achieve Enlightenment, met Shiva, and was given a &quot;special mission&quot; to preach &quot;real Buddhism&quot; in Japan. The Dalai Lama later distanced himself from Asahara and said that he had met &quot;a strange Japanese man&quot;, but denied having any significant relationship with him. Asahara returned permanently to Japan in 1987 and assumed the title &quot;sonshi&quot; meaning &quot;guru&quot; before stating that he had mastered meditation to such an extent that he could lift himself with his mind. He promoted this achievement with pamphlets produced by his own publishing company, but outside a few Japanese periodicals with an occult subject, little publicity was achieved.

==Aum Shinrikyo==

===Establishment===
, currently named , was founded by Asahara in his one-bedroom apartment in Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya ward in 1987, starting off as a yoga and meditation class known as and steadily grew in the following years. It gained official status as a religious organization in 1989 and attracted a considerable number of graduates from Japan&#x27;s elite universities, thus being dubbed a &quot;religion for the elite&quot;.

===Early activities===
Although Aum was considered controversial in Japan, it was not initially associated with serious crimes until Asahara became obsessed with Biblical prophecies. Aum&#x27;s public relations activities included publishing comics and animated cartoons that attempted to tie its religious ideas to popular anime and manga themes, including space missions, powerful weapons, world conspiracies, and the quest for ultimate truth. Aum published several magazines including &quot;Vajrayana Sacca&quot; and &quot;Enjoy Happiness&quot;, adopting a somewhat missionary attitude. Isaac Asimov&#x27;s science fiction &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot; was referenced &quot;depicting as it does an elite group of spiritually evolved scientists forced to go underground during an age of barbarism so as to prepare themselves for the moment...when they will emerge to rebuild civilization&quot;. It has been posited that Aum&#x27;s publications used Christian and Buddhist ideas to impress what he considered to be the more shrewd and educated Japanese who were not attracted to boring, purely traditional sermons.

Advertising and recruitment activities, dubbed the &quot;Aum Salvation plan&quot;, included claims of curing physical illnesses with health improvement techniques, realizing life goals by improving intelligence and positive thinking, and concentrating on what was important at the expense of leisure. This was to be accomplished by practicing ancient teachings, accurately translated from original Pali sutras. These efforts resulted in Aum being able to recruit a variety of people ranging from bureaucrats to personnel from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. Authors David Kaplan and Andrew Marshall, in their 1996 book, &quot;The Cult at the End of the World&quot;, claim that initiation rituals often involved the use of hallucinogens, such as LSD. Religious practices often involved extremely ascetic practices claimed to be &quot;yoga&quot;. These included everything from renunciants being hung upside down to being given shock therapy.

The cult started attracting controversy in the late-1980s with accusations of deception of recruits, holding cult members against their will, forcing members to donate money and murdering a cult member who tried to leave in February 1989. Kaplan and Marshall alleged in their book that Aum was also connected with such activities as extortion. The group, authors report, &quot;commonly took patients into its hospitals and then forced them to pay exorbitant medical bills&quot;.

===Sakamoto family murder===

In October 1989, Tokyo Broadcasting System Television (TBS) taped an interview with 33-year-old Tsutsumi Sakamoto, a lawyer working on a class action lawsuit against Aum Shinrikyo, regarding his anti-Aum efforts. However, the network secretly showed a video of the interview to Aum members without Sakamoto&#x27;s knowledge, intentionally breaking its protection of sources. Aum officials then pressured TBS to cancel the planned broadcast of the interview. Several days later, on November 3, 1989, several Aum Shinrikyo members, including Hideo Murai, chief scientist, Satoro Hashimoto, a martial arts master, Tomomasa Nakagawa and Kazuaki Okazaki drove to Yokohama, where Sakamoto lived. They carried a pouch with fourteen hypodermic needles and a supply of potassium chloride. According to court testimony provided by the perpetrators later, they planned to use the chemical substance to kidnap Sakamoto from Yokohama&#x27;s Shinkansen train station, but, contrary to expectations, he did not show up—it was a holiday (&quot;Bunka no hi&quot;, or &quot;Culture Day&quot;), so he slept in with his family at home.

At 3 a.m. on November 5, the group entered Sakamoto&#x27;s apartment through an unlocked door. Tsutsumi Sakamoto was struck on the head with a hammer, injected with potassium chloride, and strangled. His 29-year-old wife, Satoko Sakamoto (坂本都子 &quot;Sakamoto Satoko&quot;) was beaten and injected with potassium chloride. Their 14-month-old infant son Tatsuhiko Sakamoto (坂本竜彦 &quot;Sakamoto Tatsuhiko&quot;) was injected with the potassium chloride and then his face was covered with a cloth. The family&#x27;s remains were placed in metal drums and hidden in three separate rural areas in three different prefectures (Tsutsumi in Niigata, Satoko in Toyama, and Tatsuhiko in Nagano) so that in case the bodies were uncovered, police might not link the three incidents. Their bed sheets were burned and the tools were dropped in the ocean. The victims&#x27; teeth were smashed to prevent identification. Their bodies were not found until the perpetrators revealed the locations after they were captured in connection with the 1995 Tokyo subway attack. By the time police searched the areas in which the victims were placed, their bodies were reduced to bones. TBS kept the showing of the video secret until March 25, 1996. This led to strong criticism that it contributed to the murder.

===Matsumoto sarin attack===

On the night of June 27, 1994, the cult carried out a chemical weapons attack against civilians when they released sarin in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto, Nagano. When carrying out the attack, Aum Shinrikyo had two goals; to attack three judges who were expected to rule against the cult in a lawsuit concerning a real estate dispute, and to test the efficacy of its sarin—which the cult was manufacturing at one of its facilities—as a weapon of mass murder. Residents of Matsumoto had also angered Asahara by vigorously opposing his plan to set up an office and factory in the city&#x27;s southern area. Opponents of the plan gathered 140,000 signatures on an anti-Aum petition, equivalent to 70 percent of Matsumoto&#x27;s population at the time.

Aum&#x27;s original plan to release the aerosol into the Matsumoto courthouse was altered when the cult members arrived in the city after the courthouse had closed. They decided to instead target a three-story apartment building where the city&#x27;s judges resided. At 10:40 pm, members of Aum used a converted refrigerator truck to release a cloud of sarin which floated near the home of the judges. The truck&#x27;s cargo space held &quot;a heating contraption that had been specifically designed to turn &quot;twelve litres of liquid sarin into an aerosol, and fans to diffuse the aerosol into the neighbourhood&quot;.

At 11:30 pm, Matsumoto police received an urgent report from paramedics that casualties were being transported to hospital. The patients were suffering from darkened vision, eye pain, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, miosis (constricted pupils), and numbness in their hands. Some victims described having seen a fog with a pungent and irritating smell floating by. A total of 274 people were treated. Five dead residents were discovered in their apartments, and two died in hospital immediately after admission. An eighth victim, Sumiko Kono, remained in a coma for fourteen years and died in 2008. The fatalities also included Yutaka Kobayashi, a 23-year-old salaryman, and Mii Yasumoto, a 29-year-old medical school student.

===Additional incidents before 1995===
The cult is known to have considered assassinations of several individuals critical of the cult, such as the heads of Buddhist sects Soka Gakkai and The Institute for Research in Human Happiness. After cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi began satirizing the cult, he was included on Aum&#x27;s assassination list. An assassination attempt was made on Kobayashi in 1993. In 1991, Aum began to use wiretapping to get NTT uniforms/equipment and created a manual for wiretapping.

In July 1993, cult members sprayed large amounts of liquid containing &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; spores from a cooling tower on the roof of Aum Shinrikyo&#x27;s Tokyo headquarters. However, their plan to cause an anthrax epidemic failed. The attack resulted in a large number of complaints about bad odors but no infections. At the end of 1993, the cult started secretly manufacturing the nerve agent sarin and later VX. Aum tested its sarin on sheep at Banjawarn Station, a remote pastoral property in Western Australia, killing 29 sheep. Both sarin and VX were then used in several assassinations between 1994 and 1995.

At the end of 1994, the cult broke into the Hiroshima factory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, in an attempt to steal technical documents on military weapons such as tanks and artillery. In December 1994 and January 1995, Masami Tsuchiya of Aum Shinrikyo synthesized 100 to 200 grams of VX which was used to attack three people. On December 2, Noboru Mizuno was attacked with syringes containing VX Gas, leaving him in a serious condition. The VX victim, who Asahara had suspected was a spy, was attacked at 7:00 a.m. on December 12, 1994, on a street in Osaka by Tomomitsu Niimi and another Aum member, who sprinkled the nerve agent on his neck. He chased them for about before collapsing, dying ten days later without coming out of a deep coma. Doctors in the hospital suspected at the time he had been poisoned with an organophosphate pesticide. But the cause of death was pinned down only after cult members were arrested for the subway attack in Tokyo in March 1995 confessed to the killing.

On January 4, Hiroyuki Nagaoka, an important member of the Aum Victims&#x27; Society, a civil organization that protested against the sect&#x27;s activities, was assassinated in the same way.
In February 1995, several cult members kidnapped Kiyoshi Kariya, a 69-year-old brother of a member who had escaped, from a Tokyo street and took him to a compound in Kamikuishiki near Mount Fuji, where he was killed. His corpse was destroyed in a microwave-powered incinerator and the remnants disposed of in Lake Kawaguchi. Before Kariya was abducted, he had been receiving threatening phone calls demanding to know the whereabouts of his sister, and he had left a note saying, &quot;If I disappear, I was abducted by Aum Shinrikyo&quot;. 

Police made plans to simultaneously raid cult facilities across Japan in March 1995. Prosecutors alleged Asahara was tipped off about this and that he ordered the Tokyo subway attack to divert police. Meanwhile, Aum had also attempted to manufacture 1,000 assault rifles, but only completed one. According to the testimony of Kenichi Hirose at the Tokyo District Court in 2000, Asahara wanted the group to be self-sufficient in manufacturing copies of the Soviet Union&#x27;s main infantry weapon, the AK-74; one rifle was smuggled into Japan, to be studied so that Aum could reverse engineer and mass-produce the AK-74. Police seized AK-74 components and blueprints from a vehicle used by an Aum member on April 6, 1995.

==Tokyo subway gas attack, arrests, and further incidents==
On the morning of March 20, 1995, Aum members released a binary chemical weapon, chemically most closely similar to sarin, in a coordinated attack on five trains in the Tokyo subway system, killing 13 commuters, seriously injuring 54 and affecting 980 more. Some estimates claim as many as 6,000 people were injured by the sarin. It is difficult to obtain exact numbers since many victims are reluctant to come forward. Prosecutors allege that Asahara was tipped off by an insider about planned police raids on cult facilities and ordered an attack in central Tokyo to divert police attention away from the group. The attack evidently backfired, and police conducted huge simultaneous raids on cult compounds across the country.

Over the next weeks, the full scale of Aum&#x27;s activities was revealed for the first time. At the cult&#x27;s headquarters in Kamikuishiki on the foot of Mount Fuji, police found explosives, chemical weapons, and a Russian Mil Mi-17 military helicopter. While the finding of biological warfare agents such as anthrax and Ebola cultures was reported, those claims now appear to have been widely exaggerated. There were stockpiles of chemicals that could be used for producing enough sarin to kill four million people. On March 30, 1995, Takaji Kunimatsu, chief of the National Police Agency, was shot four times near his house in Tokyo and was seriously wounded. While many suspected Aum involvement in the shooting, the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; reported that Hiroshi Nakamura is suspected of the crime, but nobody has been charged.

On April 23, 1995, Hideo Murai, the head of Aum&#x27;s Ministry of Science, was stabbed to death outside the cult&#x27;s Tokyo headquarters amidst a crowd of about 100 reporters, in front of cameras. The man responsible, a Korean member of Yamaguchi-gumi, was arrested and eventually convicted of the murder. His motive remains unknown. On the evening of May 5, a burning paper bag was discovered in a toilet in Tokyo&#x27;s busy Shinjuku station. Upon examination it was revealed that it was a hydrogen cyanide device which, had it not been extinguished in time, would have released enough gas into the ventilation system to potentially kill 10,000 commuters. On July 4, several undetonated cyanide devices were found at other locations in the Tokyo subway.

During this time, numerous cult members were arrested for various offenses, but arrests of the most senior members on the charge of the subway gassing had not yet taken place. In June, an individual unrelated to Aum had launched a copycat attack by hijacking All Nippon Airways Flight 857, a Boeing 747 bound for Hakodate from Tokyo. The hijacker claimed to be an Aum member in possession of sarin and plastic explosives, but these claims were ultimately found to be false. Asahara was finally found hiding within a wall of a cult building known as &quot;The 6th Satian&quot; in the Kamikuishiki complex on May 16 and was arrested. On the same day, the cult mailed a parcel bomb to the office of Yukio Aoshima, the governor of Tokyo, blowing off the fingers of his secretary&#x27;s hand.

===After 1995===
On June 21, 1995, Asahara acknowledged that in January 1994 he ordered the killing of a sect member, Kotaro Ochida, a pharmacist at an Aum hospital. Ochida, who tried to escape from a sect compound, was held down and strangled by another Aum member who was allegedly told that he too would be killed if he did not strangle Ochida. Fumihiro Joyu, one of the few senior leaders of the group under Asahara who did not face serious charges, became official head of the organization in 1999. Kōki Ishii, a legislator who formed an anti-Aum committee in the National Diet in 1999, was murdered in 2002. At 11:50 p.m. on December 31, 2011, Makoto Hirata surrendered himself to the police and was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the 1995 abduction of Kiyoshi Kariya, a non-member who had died during an Aum kidnapping and interrogation.

==Trial and execution==

Asahara faced 27 counts of murder in 13 separate indictments. The prosecution argued that Asahara gave orders to attack the Tokyo Subway to &quot;overthrow the government and install himself in the position of Emperor of Japan&quot;. Later, during the trial which took more than seven years to conclude, the prosecution forwarded an additional theory that the attacks were ordered to divert police attention away from Aum. The prosecution also accused Asahara of masterminding the Matsumoto incident and the Sakamoto family murder. During the trials, some of the disciples testified against Asahara, and he was found guilty on 13 of 17 charges, including the Sakamoto family murder; four charges were dropped. On February 27, 2004, he was sentenced to death. The trial was called the &quot;trial of the century&quot; by the Japanese media.

The defence appealed against Asahara&#x27;s sentence on the grounds that he was mentally unfit and psychiatric examinations were undertaken. During much of the trials, Asahara remained silent or only muttered to himself. However, he communicated with the staff at his detention facility, which convinced the examiner that Asahara was maintaining his silence out of free will. Owing to his lawyers&#x27; failure to submit the statement of reason for appeal, the Tokyo High Court decided on March 27, 2006, not to grant them leave to appeal. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of Japan on September 15, 2006. Two re-trial appeals were declined by the appellate court. In June 2012, Asahara&#x27;s execution was postponed due to arrests of several fugitive Aum Shinrikyo members.

Asahara was executed by hanging at the Tokyo Detention House on July 6, 2018, along with six other cult members. Relatives of victims said they approved the execution. Asahara&#x27;s final words, as reported by officials, assigned his remains to his fourth daughter, who was unsympathetic to the cult and stated she planned to dispose of the ashes at sea; this was contested by Asahara&#x27;s wife, third daughter, and other family members, who were suspected of wanting to enshrine the ashes where believers can honor them. Until 2024, the ashes remained at the Tokyo Detention House. In 2021, the Supreme Court of Japan ordered Asahara&#x27;s remains to be released to his second daughter, which was affirmed by the Tokyo District Court in 2024.

<doc id="98971" wikidata="Q1017286" url="?curid=98971" title="Busch Memorial Stadium">
<text>Busch Memorial Stadium (Busch Stadium II) was a multi-purpose sports facility in St. Louis, Missouri, that operated for 40 years, from 1966 through 2005. Built as Civic Center Busch Memorial Stadium, its official name was shortened to Busch Stadium in January 1982.

The stadium served as the home of the St. Louis Cardinals National League baseball team for its entire operating existence, while also serving as home to the National Football League&#x27;s Cardinals team for 22 seasons, from 1966 through 1987, as well as the St. Louis Rams during part of the 1995 season. It opened four days after the last baseball game was played at Sportsman&#x27;s Park (which had been renamed Busch Stadium in 1953, when Anheuser-Busch bought the team). The St. Louis Stars of the NPSL and later NASL played at the stadium from 1967 to 1974; the team later used the stadium for select matches up through the 1977 season.

The stadium was designed by Sverdrup &amp; Parcel and built by Grün &amp; Bilfinger. Edward Durell Stone designed the roof, a 96-arch &quot;Crown of Arches&quot;. The Crown echoed the Gateway Arch, which had been completed only a year before Busch Stadium opened. Otherwise, it was very similar in appearance to other circular multipurpose &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; stadiums built in the 1960s and early 1970s in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh, all of which were essentially open-air copies of the Houston Astrodome.

Its final event was the sixth game of the 2005 NLCS on October 19. The stadium was demolished by wrecking ball in late 2005 and part of its former footprint is occupied by its replacement stadium—the new Busch Stadium (a.k.a. Busch Stadium III), located just south.

==History==
===Background===
With new stadiums such as the Astrodome and Shea Stadium, St. Louis felt the need to modernize. Many of these stadiums demonstrated modern feats of engineering and architecture, but also demonstrated a transition occurring for the American public at the time—traditional to the cutting edge. At the time of design, the Busch Stadium II was planned to be used for several purposes. The stadium was named Civic Center Busch Memorial Stadium. Just weeks after opening, the new stadium hosted the All-Star Game, followed by a performance by the Beatles. The landmark that distinguishes St. Louis&#x27; skyline today, the Gateway Arch, was built across the street. To complement this historic landmark, the new stadium had 96 open arches on its roof. As a testament to the design, Busch was one of the last built in the 1960s to be torn down. After serving the St. Louis Cardinals for 40 seasons, it was torn down in 2005.

===Construction===
The baseball Cardinals had played at Sportsman&#x27;s Park since , originally as tenants of the St. Louis Browns of the American League.

The Cardinals had long since passed the Browns as St. Louis&#x27; premier team, and chafed at having the Browns as landlords. At least as early as the 1940s, the Cardinals had sought to build their own park. Longtime owner Sam Breadon had set aside $3 million to build a new park. However, he was unable to find any land to do so, and World War II put those plans on hold. By 1947, Breadon faced the prospect of having to pay a heavy tax bill on his stadium fund. Tax lawyer Fred Saigh convinced Breadon to sell him the team, arguing this would save the Cardinals from this stiff tax burden.

When this tax dodge came to light in 1953 following an IRS audit, Saigh was subsequently charged with tax evasion, and pleaded no contest. Facing certain banishment from baseball, he put the team up for sale. Ultimately, Anheuser-Busch bought the Cardinals with the specific goal of keeping them in St. Louis.

However, the Cardinals would have needed a new park in any event. Sportsman&#x27;s Park had been built in its final form in 1909, and had not aged well. By 1953, even with the rent from the Cardinals, there was not nearly enough revenue to bring the stadium up to code, with city officials even threatening to have it condemned. With this in mind, soon after Anheuser-Busch bought the Cardinals, Browns owner Bill Veeck sold the park to the Cardinals, who heavily renovated the park and renamed it Busch Stadium, while Veeck relocated his team to Baltimore (rebranding it the Orioles).

By the late 1950s, however, the need for a new park could no longer be staved off. Sportsman&#x27;s Park/Busch Stadium had almost no parking, and the neighborhood around it had gone to seed.

In 1958, Charles Farris, the city&#x27;s head of development, proposed a new stadium downtown as the core of a plan to revive a 31-block area of the business district. The original design of the stadium called for a baseball-only format, but after the NFL&#x27;s Chicago Cardinals moved to St. Louis at the end of the 1959 season, becoming known as the football Cardinals in St. Louis, the design was altered to accommodate football as well: the football Cardinals would share Sportsman&#x27;s Park/Busch Stadium with the baseball Cardinals.

With support from the local Chamber of Commerce, the Civic Center Redevelopment Corporation was established in September 1959, and it was given power of eminent domain, which was used to condemn several areas that were rundown or had gone to seed years before, including the small Chinatown district, the Grand Theater (a historic opera house that had evolved into a burlesque strip club), and various flophouses and abandoned warehouses.

Groundbreaking occurred on May 25, 1964, and construction took just under two years. The plan also included parking garages, a hotel (a Stouffer&#x27;s hotel), and office buildings. A few years later, it also became the new home of the Spanish Pavilion from the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

The stadium opened on May 12, 1966, one month into the baseball season, as &quot;Civic Center Busch Memorial Stadium.&quot; However, the &quot;Civic Center&quot; part was rarely used, and most people called it simply &quot;Busch Memorial Stadium.&quot;

===Subsequent years===
The stadium&#x27;s grass was replaced with AstroTurf in 1970. St. Louis&#x27; notoriously hot summers made it difficult to keep the grass alive, especially when the football Cardinals insisted on practicing on the field during the end of the baseball Cardinals&#x27; season. The Cardinals retained a full dirt infield for eight seasons. A removable, sectioned Astroturf surface covered the infield during football season. The infield was converted to sliding pits when the surface was replaced for the 1978 baseball season. With artificial turf, the playing conditions at Busch Stadium were among the hottest in baseball, with temperatures well above the local official readings.
Anheuser-Busch (who owned the baseball Cardinals at the time) bought the stadium in 1981 for $53 million and removed the &quot;Memorial&quot; from the stadium&#x27;s name, becoming simply Busch Stadium; the price included the parking garages.

Over the years, the grounds became home to bronze statues of Stan Musial, Enos Slaughter, Dizzy Dean, Rogers Hornsby, Red Schoendienst, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, James &quot;Cool Papa&quot; Bell, George Sisler, Jack Buck, and Ozzie Smith.

Following Busch&#x27;s last 1995 event—the Rams&#x27; October 22 game before the opening of the now-Dome at America&#x27;s Center—the Cardinals retrofitted it into a baseball-only stadium. A large section of the upper deck outfield seats was closed, replaced with a hand-operated scoreboard and flags commemorating the Cardinals&#x27; retired numbers and World Series championships. The stadium&#x27;s original natural grass field was restored, and the outfield walls were re-painted green from their original blue.
===Demolition===

Busch Memorial Stadium was originally slated to be imploded, like most modern-day stadium demolitions, to be able to finish construction on the new stadium in time for the 2006 season. Due to fear of damaging the nearby Stadium MetroLink station, it was decided to tear down the stadium with a wrecking ball, piece-by-piece, over the course of a few weeks.

Demolition of the stadium began at 3:07 p.m. CST on November 7 and was completed shortly after midnight on December 8, 2005.

Part of the footprint of the old stadium is now occupied by the outfield of the current stadium. The Cardinals had planned to build Ballpark Village on the site of the stadium ($320 million for the first phase). It was to consist of boutiques and restaurants, condominium apartments anchored by the new headquarters of Centene Corporation—all to be built in time for the All-Star Game in 2009.

None of the construction had occurred until groundbreaking ceremonies on February 8, 2013, and locals derisively referred to its rain-soaked unfinished status before that date as &quot;Lake DeWitt&quot;—after Cardinal President William DeWitt, Jr. In March 2009, the Cardinals announced the site would be used for a softball field and parking during the game.

== Uses ==

===Baseball===

In its opening year, Busch Stadium hosted the All-Star Game, a 2–1 National League victory in 10 innings, mostly remembered for the humidity and temperatures. The stadium hosted World Series games in six different seasons: , , , , , and . The Cardinals won the World Series in 1967 and 1982 while playing in the stadium (the seventh game of the 1982 Series was won at Busch). The 1968 and 2004 World Series were clinched in Busch Stadium by visitors: the Detroit Tigers in the seventh game and the Boston Red Sox in a four-game sweep, respectively.

The stadium was also the site of Mark McGwire&#x27;s historic 62nd home run of the 1998 season that broke Roger Maris&#x27; single-season record, and also of McGwire&#x27;s 70th of that season, for a record which lasted until Barry Bonds surpassed it in 2001. The dimensions in the center and the power alleys had been altered from time to time over the years. Initially, the park was very favorable to pitchers, with spacious outfield dimensions. Consequently, its design (as well as the Astroturf surface) was favorable to the Cardinals&#x27; style of play for most of the time from the 1960s through the 1990s, which emphasized good baserunning and extra-base hits. Later changes attempted to make the outfield better balanced between pitching and power hitting.

Before the 1996 season, the stadium was retrofitted to become a baseball-only stadium. Part of the top deck in center field was permanently closed, and in 1997, flags were put in place to honor the team&#x27;s retired numbers and pennants. Even before then, the stadium had come under less scorn from baseball purists than other cookie-cutter stadiums built during the same era, partly because the &quot;crown of arches&quot; gave it a more traditional look than its cousins and partially because it was alone amongst cookie-cutters in having field-level outfield seating.

The baseball diamond was oriented southeast by east (home to center field); the new stadium is aligned east-northeast, the recommended orientation by MLB.

===Football===
Busch Stadium was also the home of the St. Louis Cardinals of the National Football League for 22 seasons, from 1966 through 1987.

The stadium was one of, and later the smallest, facilities in the NFL: while the football Cardinals played there, it seated 54,692 people, barely more than the NFL&#x27;s minimum capacity of 50,000 (mandated in 1970). Various efforts were made to get a new larger stadium or expansion of Busch Stadium, but after these failed, Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill relocated the team to Phoenix, Arizona after the 1987 season.

The football Cardinals never hosted a playoff game during their 28 seasons in St. Louis, while the &quot;Gridbirds&quot; made only three playoff appearances during that stretch, losing on the road against the Minnesota Vikings in 1974, Los Angeles Rams in 1975, and Green Bay Packers in 1982. Despite this lack of success, they won the third place Playoff Bowl after the 1964 season, upsetting Vince Lombardi&#x27;s Packers 31–24 at the Orange Bowl in Miami.

Busch Stadium was also briefly the home of the St. Louis Rams, who had relocated from Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California. Due to completion of their new home stadium, the new and nearby Trans World Dome (later renamed the Dome at America&#x27;s Center) being delayed, the Rams played the first half of the 1995 season at Busch Stadium: for these four home games, Busch Stadium seated 60,000 people.

The Rams played their last game at Busch Stadium on October 22, while the new indoor venue hosted its first NFL game on November 12, 1995.

Between the Cardinals&#x27; 1987 departure and the Rams&#x27; 1995 arrival, the stadium hosted two NFL pre-season games: one between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots in 1989, and one between the New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs in 1991.

===Soccer===

The St. Louis Stars, a professional soccer team, played at Busch Stadium for several years in the 1960s and 1970s. They were initially a member of the National Professional Soccer League for one season in 1967 and moved to the North American Soccer League for their remaining seasons, which they split between Busch Stadium and Francis Field. The team set their record attendance of 32,605 against the New York Cosmos in 1977. The Stars were relocated to Southern California after the 1977 season after being unable to sign a new lease at Busch Stadium.

The stadium also hosted international soccer. It served as the temporary home venue for Trinidad and Tobago in a 1985 CONCACAF Championship match against the United States, who won 2–1 in front of 15,823 fans. The match was part of regional qualifiers for the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

The annual Bronze Boot Game between the Saint Louis Billikens and the SIU Edwardsville Cougars was played at Busch Stadium from 1972 until 1985. The matchup saw record size crowds, including the all-time record attendance for a regular season college soccer match: 22,512 on October 30, 1980.

<text>Ingham is a small village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It lies close to the village of Stalham, and is about from Sea Palling on the North Sea coast.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 376 in 153 households, falling slightly to 374 at the 2011 census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of North Norfolk.

There are the remains of a priory and the Ingham Poor&#x27;s Allotment.

==History==
Ingham is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the village of Hincham in the hundred of Happing. Possible etymologies are &quot;homestead or village of [a man called] Inga&quot; or &quot;home of the Inguiones&quot; (an ancient Germanic tribe).

The Lordship of Ingham was possessed at a very early date by the Ingham family. An Oliver de Ingham was living in 1183 and a John de Ingham is known to have been Lord in the reign of Richard I. The great-grandson of John, the distinguished Oliver Ingham lived here and his son-in-law Miles Stapleton of Bedale, Yorkshire, inherited jure uxoris.

Ingham Old Hall has its origins in the medieval times having been built circa 1320. In the 14th century the Hall was inhabited by the local Lord of the Manor, Sir Miles Stapleton, whose tomb stands in Ingham&#x27;s Holy Trinity church alongside that of his father in law, Sir Oliver de Ingham.

==Amenities==
The village has one public house, The Ingham Swan, which is one of only two public houses tied to the Woodforde&#x27;s Brewery of Woodbastwick in Norfolk. The original building was built in the 14th century and was part of Ingham Priory until its destruction under Henry VIII in the 16th century. In spring 2010 chef Daniel Smith and business partner Gregory Adjemian took ownership of the pub, renaming it as The Ingham Swan to avoid confusion with The Swan in nearby Stalham. The building has had much interior renovation.

<doc id="98974" wikidata="Q2679259" url="?curid=98974" title="Linear classifier">
<text>In machine learning, a linear classifier makes a classification decision for each object based on a linear combination of its features. Such classifiers work well for practical problems such as document classification, and more generally for problems with many variables (features), reaching accuracy levels comparable to non-linear classifiers while taking less time to train and use.

== Definition ==
If the input feature vector to the classifier is a real vector formula_1, then the output score is

:formula_2

where formula_3 is a real vector of weights and &quot;f&quot; is a function that converts the dot product of the two vectors into the desired output. (In other words, formula_4 is a one-form or linear functional mapping formula_1 onto R.) The weight vector formula_6 is learned from a set of labeled training samples. Often &quot;f&quot; is a threshold function, which maps all values of formula_7 above a certain threshold to the first class and all other values to the second class; e.g.,

:formula_8

The superscript T indicates the transpose and formula_9 is a scalar threshold. A more complex &quot;f&quot; might give the probability that an item belongs to a certain class.

For a two-class classification problem, one can visualize the operation of a linear classifier as splitting a high-dimensional input space with a hyperplane: all points on one side of the hyperplane are classified as &quot;yes&quot;, while the others are classified as &quot;no&quot;.

A linear classifier is often used in situations where the speed of classification is an issue, since it is often the fastest classifier, especially when formula_1 is sparse. Also, linear classifiers often work very well when the number of dimensions in formula_1 is large, as in document classification, where each element in formula_1 is typically the number of occurrences of a word in a document (see document-term matrix). In such cases, the classifier should be well-regularized.

==Generative models vs. discriminative models==
There are two broad classes of methods for determining the parameters of a linear classifier formula_6. They can be generative and discriminative models. Methods of the former model joint probability distribution, whereas methods of the latter model conditional density functions formula_14. Examples of such algorithms include:
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)—assumes Gaussian conditional density models
* Naive Bayes classifier with multinomial or multivariate Bernoulli event models.

The second set of methods includes discriminative models, which attempt to maximize the quality of the output on a training set. Additional terms in the training cost function can easily perform regularization of the final model. Examples of discriminative training of linear classifiers include:
* Logistic regression—maximum likelihood estimation of formula_6 assuming that the observed training set was generated by a binomial model that depends on the output of the classifier.
* Perceptron—an algorithm that attempts to fix all errors encountered in the training set
* Fisher&#x27;s Linear Discriminant Analysis—an algorithm (different than &quot;LDA&quot;) that maximizes the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter, without any other assumptions. It is in essence a method of dimensionality reduction for binary classification.
* Support vector machine—an algorithm that maximizes the margin between the decision hyperplane and the examples in the training set.

Note: Despite its name, LDA does not belong to the class of discriminative models in this taxonomy. However, its name makes sense when we compare LDA to the other main linear dimensionality reduction algorithm: principal components analysis (PCA). LDA is a supervised learning algorithm that utilizes the labels of the data, while PCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm that ignores the labels. To summarize, the name is a historical artifact.

Discriminative training often yields higher accuracy than modeling the conditional density functions. However, handling missing data is often easier with conditional density models.

All of the linear classifier algorithms listed above can be converted into non-linear algorithms operating on a different input space formula_16, using the kernel trick.

===Discriminative training===
Discriminative training of linear classifiers usually proceeds in a supervised way, by means of an optimization algorithm that is given a training set with desired outputs and a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the classifier&#x27;s outputs and the desired outputs. Thus, the learning algorithm solves an optimization problem of the form

:formula_17

where

* is a vector of classifier parameters,
* is a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the classifier&#x27;s prediction and the true output for the &#x27;th training example,
* is a regularization function that prevents the parameters from getting too large (causing overfitting), and
* is a scalar constant (set by the user of the learning algorithm) that controls the balance between the regularization and the loss function.

Popular loss functions include the hinge loss (for linear SVMs) and the log loss (for linear logistic regression). If the regularization function is convex, then the above is a convex problem. Many algorithms exist for solving such problems; popular ones for linear classification include (stochastic) gradient descent, L-BFGS, coordinate descent and Newton methods.

<text>In algebraic number theory, an algebraic integer is a complex number that is integral over the integers. That is, an algebraic integer is a complex root of some monic polynomial (a polynomial whose leading coefficient is 1) whose coefficients are integers. The set of all algebraic integers is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication and therefore is a commutative subring of the complex numbers.

The ring of integers of a number field , denoted by , is the intersection of and : it can also be characterised as the maximal order of the field . Each algebraic integer belongs to the ring of integers of some number field. A number is an algebraic integer if and only if the ring formula_1 is finitely generated as an abelian group, which is to say, as a formula_2-module.

==Definitions==

The following are equivalent definitions of an algebraic integer. Let be a number field (i.e., a finite extension of formula_3, the field of rational numbers), in other words, formula_4 for some algebraic number formula_5 by the primitive element theorem.

* is an algebraic integer if there exists a monic polynomial formula_6 such that .
* is an algebraic integer if the minimal monic polynomial of over formula_3 is in formula_8.
* is an algebraic integer if formula_9 is a finitely generated formula_10-module.
* is an algebraic integer if there exists a non-zero finitely generated formula_10-submodule formula_12 such that .

Algebraic integers are a special case of integral elements of a ring extension. In particular, an algebraic integer is an integral element of a finite extension formula_13.

==Examples==
* The only algebraic integers that are found in the set of rational numbers are the integers. In other words, the intersection of formula_3 and is exactly formula_2. The rational number is not an algebraic integer unless divides . The leading coefficient of the polynomial is the integer .
* The square root formula_16 of a nonnegative integer is an algebraic integer, but is irrational unless is a perfect square.
*If is a square-free integer then the extension formula_17 is a quadratic field of rational numbers. The ring of algebraic integers contains formula_18 since this is a root of the monic polynomial . Moreover, if , then the element formula_19 is also an algebraic integer. It satisfies the polynomial where the constant term is an integer. The full ring of integers is generated by formula_18 or formula_19 respectively. See Quadratic integer for more.
*The ring of integers of the field formula_22, , has the following integral basis, writing for two square-free coprime integers and : formula_23
* If is a primitive th root of unity, then the ring of integers of the cyclotomic field formula_24 is precisely formula_25.
* If is an algebraic integer then is another algebraic integer. A polynomial for is obtained by substituting in the polynomial for .

==Non-example==
* If is a primitive polynomial that has integer coefficients but is not monic, and is irreducible over formula_3, then none of the roots of are algebraic integers (but &quot;are&quot; algebraic numbers). Here &quot;primitive&quot; is used in the sense that the highest common factor of the coefficients of is 1, which is weaker than requiring the coefficients to be pairwise relatively prime.

==Finite generation of ring extension==
For any , the ring extension (in the sense that is equivalent to field extension) of the integers by , denoted by formula_27, is finitely generated if and only if is an algebraic integer.

The proof is analogous to that of the corresponding fact regarding algebraic numbers, with formula_28 there replaced by formula_10 here, and the notion of field extension degree replaced by finite generation (using the fact that formula_10 is finitely generated itself); the only required change is that only non-negative powers of are involved in the proof. 

The analogy is possible because both algebraic integers and algebraic numbers are defined as roots of monic polynomials over either formula_10 or formula_28, respectively.

==Ring==
The sum, difference and product of two algebraic integers is an algebraic integer. In general their quotient is not. Thus the algebraic integers form a ring.

This can be shown analogously to the corresponding proof for algebraic numbers, using the integers formula_10 instead of the rationals formula_28.

One may also construct explicitly the monic polynomial involved, which is generally of higher degree than those of the original algebraic integers, by taking resultants and factoring. For example, if , and , then eliminating and from and the polynomials satisfied by and using the resultant gives , which is irreducible, and is the monic equation satisfied by the product. (To see that the is a root of the -resultant of and , one might use the fact that the resultant is contained in the ideal generated by its two input polynomials.)

===Integral closure===
Every root of a monic polynomial whose coefficients are algebraic integers is itself an algebraic integer. In other words, the algebraic integers form a ring that is integrally closed in any of its extensions.

Again, the proof is analogous to the corresponding proof for algebraic numbers being algebraically closed.

==Additional facts==
* Any number constructible out of the integers with roots, addition, and multiplication is an algebraic integer; but not all algebraic integers are so constructible: in a naïve sense, most roots of irreducible quintics are not. This is the Abel–Ruffini theorem. 
* The ring of algebraic integers is a Bézout domain, as a consequence of the principal ideal theorem.
* If the monic polynomial associated with an algebraic integer has constant term 1 or −1, then the reciprocal of that algebraic integer is also an algebraic integer, and each is a unit, an element of the group of units of the ring of algebraic integers.
* If is an algebraic number then is an algebraic integer, where satisfies a polynomial with integer coefficients and where is the highest-degree term of . The value is an algebraic integer because it is a root of , where is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients.
* If is an algebraic number then it can be written as the ratio of an algebraic integer to a non-zero algebraic integer. In fact, the denominator can always be chosen to be a positive integer. The ratio is , where satisfies a polynomial with integer coefficients and where is the highest-degree term of .
* The only rational algebraic integers are the integers. Thus, if is an algebraic integers and formula_35, then formula_36. This is a direct result of the rational root theorem for the case of a monic polynomial.

<text>Millenarianism or millenarism () is the belief by a religious, social, or political group or movement in a coming fundamental transformation of society, after which &quot;all things will be changed&quot;. Millenarianism exists in various cultures and religions worldwide, with various interpretations of what constitutes a transformation.

These movements believe in radical changes to society after a major cataclysm or transformative event.

Millenarianist movements can be secular (not espousing a particular religion) or religious in nature, and are therefore not necessarily linked to millennialist movements in Christianity.

== Terminology ==
Both &quot;millennialism&quot; and &quot;millenarianism&quot; refer to &quot;one thousand&quot;. They both derive from the Christian tradition. Neither term strictly refers to &quot;one thousand&quot; in modern [1963] academic usage. Millennialism often refers to a specific type of Christian millenarianism, and is sometimes referred to as Chiliasm from the New Testament use of the Greek .

The terms &quot;millennialism&quot; and &quot;millenarianism&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, as in &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism&quot;. Stephen Jay Gould has argued that this usage is incorrect, stating:
The application of an apocalyptic timetable to the changing of the world has happened in many cultures and religions, continues to this day, and is not relegated to the sects of major world religions, both Abrahamic and non-Abrahamic. Increasingly in the study of apocalyptic new religious movements, &quot;millenarianism&quot; is used to refer to a more cataclysmic and destructive arrival of a utopian period as compared to &quot;millennialism&quot; which is often used to denote a more peaceful arrival and is more closely associated with a one thousand year utopia.

Christian millennialism is part of the broader form of apocalyptic expectation. A core doctrine in some variations of Christian eschatology is the expectation that the Second Coming is very near and that there will be an establishment of a Kingdom of God on Earth. According to an interpretation of biblical prophecies in the Book of Revelation, this Kingdom of God on Earth will last a thousand years (a &quot;millennium&quot;) or more.

== Theology ==
Many if not most millenarian groups claim that the current society and its rulers are corrupt, unjust, or otherwise wrong, and that they will soon be destroyed by a powerful force. The harmful nature of the status quo is considered intractable without the anticipated dramatic change. Henri Desroche observed that millenarian movements often envisioned three periods in which change might occur. First, the elect members of the movement will be increasingly oppressed, leading to the second period in which the movement resists the oppression. The third period brings about a new utopian age, liberating the members of the movement.

In the modern world, economic rules, perceived immorality or vast conspiracies are seen as generating oppression. Only dramatic events are seen as able to change the world and the change is anticipated to be brought about, or survived, by a group of the devout and dedicated. In most millenarian scenarios, the disaster or battle to come will be followed by a new, purified world in which the believers will be rewarded.

While many millenarian groups are pacifistic, millenarian beliefs have been claimed as causes for people to ignore conventional rules of behaviour, which can result in violence directed inwards (such as the Jonestown mass murder) or outwards (such as the Aum Shinrikyo terrorist acts). It sometimes includes a belief in supernatural powers or predetermined victory. In some cases, millenarians withdraw from society to await the intervention of God. This is also known as world-rejection.

Millenarian ideologies or religious sects sometimes appear in oppressed peoples, with examples such as the 19th-century Ghost Dance movement among Native Americans, early Mormons, and the 19th and 20th-century cargo cults among isolated Pacific Islanders.

The Catechism [doctrine] of the Catholic Church rejects all forms of millenarianism and its variations:

<doc id="98984" wikidata="Q813574" url="?curid=98984" title="Beccles">
<text>Beccles ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the East Suffolk district, in the county of Suffolk, England. The town is located along the A145 and A12 roads, situated south-east of Norwich and north-northeast of Ipswich. Nearby towns include Lowestoft to the east and Great Yarmouth to the north-east. The town lies on the River Waveney on the edge of The Broads National Park.

It had a population at the 2011 census of 10,123. Worlingham is a suburb of Beccles; the combined population is 13,868. Beccles twinned with Petit-Couronne in France in 1978.

==History==

The place-name &#x27;Beccles&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as ‘Becles’, located in the ancient hundred of Wangford. It appears as ‘Beacles’ circa 1095 in a document from Bury St Edmunds Abbey, and as ‘Beclis’ in 1157 and ‘Becclis’ in 1158 in the Pipe Rolls. The name is probably from the Old English ‘bec-laes’ meaning ‘pasture on the stream’, cognate with the German word ‘Bach’ meaning ‘stream’, and the English word ‘lea’ meaning ‘meadow’.

Once a flourishing Anglian riverport, Beccles lies in the Waveney valley and is a popular boating centre.

The town was first granted its Charter on 2 July 1584 by Elizabeth I, under the name of the Corporation of Beccles Fen. This was subsequently confirmed by James I on 19 May 1605.

Sir John Leman (died 1632) was a tradesman from Beccles who became Lord Mayor of London.

Long associated with Beccles (including recent mayors) is the Peck family. Among those Pecks who have made a place in history is the Rev. Robert Peck, described by Blomfield in his history of Norfolk as a man with a &#x27;violent schismatic spirit&#x27; who led a movement within the church of St Andrew&#x27;s in nearby Hingham, Norfolk, in opposition to the established Anglicanism of the day. The Puritan Peck was eventually forced to flee to Hingham, Massachusetts, founded by many members of his parish, where he resided for several years, until King Charles I had been executed and Oliver Cromwell had taken the reins of government. Robert Peck then elected to return to Hingham, Norfolk, and resumed as rector of St Andrew&#x27;s Church. He died in Hingham but left descendants in America, including his brother Joseph Peck, who settled in Rehoboth, Massachusetts. Robert&#x27;s daughter Ann Peck (16 November 1619 – 30 June 1672) also remained in Massachusetts, and married John Mason, who led colonial forces in the Pequot War.

In 1794, French émigré François-René de Chateaubriand worked in Beccles as a French teacher. While there, he fell in love with Charlotte Ives, daughter of a clergyman who lived in nearby Bungay.

Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 the borough was reformed which became part of the administrative county of East Suffolk in 1889, the district contained the parish of Beccles. On 1 April 1974 the district and parish were abolished and became part of Waveney district in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. A successor parish was formed covering the same area as the former district and its parish. The successor civil parish has adopted town status.

==Landmarks==

Many of the streets in the town centre have the suffix &#x27;gate&#x27;, for example, Ballygate, Smallgate and Blyburgate. This is derived from the Old Norse for &#x27;street&#x27; and is similar to the modern Danish word &quot;gade&quot;.

The townscape is dominated by the detached 16th-century Beccles bell tower of St Michael&#x27;s Church. Like the main body of the church, the tower is Perpendicular Gothic in style and is tall. The church was built in the 14th century but was rebuilt after being badly damaged by fire in 1586. It has a 13th-century octagonal baptismal font and 14th-century south porch. Both the church and the tower are Grade I listed buildings.

Catherine Suckling married the Reverend Edmund Nelson, a former curate of Beccles, at the church in 1749. Their son, the naval hero Horatio Nelson, was born in 1758 in Norfolk. The Suffolk poet George Crabbe married Sarah Elmy at the church in the 18th century.

Opposite the church is Beccles Town Hall, built on the site of the town&#x27;s market cross. This is at the centre of the Newmarket area, which still features a weekly market.

Beccles Museum is housed in Leman House, a Grade I listed building to the south of the town centre on Ballygate. The building dates from the 16th century and was the original site of the town&#x27;s Grammar School, named after John Leman who endowed it following his death in 1631.

Beccles Common is an area of common land, to the north west of the town. In the centre of Beccles Common sits a World War Two era Pillbox built in 1940 or 1941. The area hosts Boney&#x27;s Island, a man-made mound on the common. The name comes from Bonaparte&#x27;s Island. There are two different sources of the name Boney&#x27;s Island. the more popular origin is that it was a prisoner of war camp during the Napoleonic wars. The less popular origin is that a large bonfire was lit on the island to celebrate the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1814.

The old Corn Exchange in Exchange Square, which dates from the early 19th century, now accommodates a branch of Lloyds Bank.

==Transport==

===Buses===
Bus services in the area are operated predominantly by First Eastern Counties and Borderbus; routes link the town with Norwich, Lowestoft, Great Yarmouth, Bungay and Southwold, along with surrounding villages.

===Railway===
The town is served by Beccles railway station on the East Suffolk Line between and . Services run hourly in each direction on weekdays, following the completion of the Beccles rail loop in 2012; the disused island platform was rebuilt and the track relaid to allow trains to pass, the only point north of Halesworth where this is possible. Services are operated by Greater Anglia.

The town was formerly the southern terminus of the Yarmouth to Beccles Line, which ran across the River Waveney marshes to Great Yarmouth and the eastern terminus of the Waveney Valley Line, linking to the Great Eastern Main Line at Tivetshall in Norfolk. Both lines closed, in 1954 and 1966 respectively; the latter as a result of the Beeching Cuts.

===Air===
Beccles Airfield is located at Ellough, around south-east of the town. Originally built in 1942 as a wartime airfield, it was used as a heliport servicing the North Sea petrochemical industry and is now a base for light aircraft and parachuting.

===Cycling===
National Cycle Route 1, which runs from London to the Orkney Islands, passes through Beccles. Regional Route 30, which runs between Wells-next-the-Sea and Brandon, and Regional Route 31, from Reedham Ferry to Southwold, also pass through the town.

===Roads===
The town is by-passed to the north by the A146 road between Norwich in Norfolk and Lowestoft in Suffolk. The by-pass was built in the 1980s and the main road previously ran through the town, crossing the River Waveney at the narrow Beccles bridge. The link road between the A146 and the town is George Westwood Way, in memory of a Deputy Mayor, George Lionel Westwood, who fought hard for the construction of the by-pass.

The A145 used to run from the A146 through the town centre to link with the A12 at Blythburgh, to the south of Beccles. The official route of the road now runs via the Beccles Southern Relief Road to indicate to drivers, particularly those of HGVs, that they can avoid the town; this is intended to make the relief road effective in keeping unnecessary traffic out of the town.

====Beccles Southern Relief Road====
In 2006, a southern relief road for Beccles was approved, running from a roundabout just south of the town towards Ellough where the A145 connects with an industrial area, before joining with the A146 at North Cove. The completion cost was around £7.0 million and the road forms part of Suffolk County Council traffic management plans. It allows north–south industrial traffic to by-pass the narrow streets of the town centre, reducing congestion and increasing safety and officially opened on 25 September 2018.

==Education==
Beccles is served by Sir John Leman High School (age 11–18) and SET Beccles School (11–16) for secondary education, both of which admit children from the town and the surrounding area, including from primary schools in Norfolk. Until 2012 a middle school system operated in the town, with most children moving to middle school at age 9 and on to high school at age 13. The Sir John Leman High School dates from 1632 when it was established in the town after the death of John Leman. It was a grammar school between 1914 and 1971.

Three primary schools operate in Beccles providing education from age 5 to 11: Beccles Primary Academy (formerly Crowfoot Primary School); St Benet&#x27;s Catholic Primary School; and The Albert Pye School which is federated with Ravensmere Infants School (5–8). Children from the town also attend primary school in Worlingham as well as surrounding villages.

==Leisure==
The annual Beccles Carnival and Family Fun weekend is held during the third weekend in August, which includes the popular Duck Race on the River Waveney.

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the weekly &quot;Beccles &amp; Bungay Journal&quot;, formed in 1933.

Two Scout Association groups, 2nd Beccles and 5th Beccles, operate in the town, as do Girlguiding groups. Beccles Sea Cadets and Beccles Royal Marines Cadets run Training Ship Brave and the town is also home to 759 (Beccles) Air Cadets.

Beccles Cricket Club, founded in 1955, play on Beef Meadow on Beccles Common. They run two senior men&#x27;s teams - the 1st team play in Division Two of the Norfolk Cricket Alliance and the 2nd team play in Division Six. They also run a women&#x27;s softball team and junior teams from the under-11 age group through to under-15.

Beccles&#x27; main football club is Beccles Town, established in 1919. As of the 2023–24 season, they are members of the Anglian Combination Premier Division. Beccles also has a football team called Beccles Caxton, with &quot;Caxton&quot; being a name commonly found in Beccles, including the Caxton Club social club, the Caxton Arms pub and Caxton Road.

Ellough Park Raceway is south-east of Beccles on the site of the old Ellough airfield. It is a local centre for kart racing.

<text>The River Waveney is a river which forms the boundary between Suffolk and Norfolk, England, for much of its length within The Broads. The earliest attestation of the name is from 1275, &quot;Wahenhe&quot;, from &quot;*wagen + ea&quot;, meaning the river by a quagmire.

==Course==
The source of the River Waveney is a ditch on the east side of the B1113 road between the villages of Redgrave, Suffolk and South Lopham, Norfolk. The ditch on the other side of the road is the source of the River Little Ouse which continues the county boundary and, via the Great Ouse, reaches the sea at King&#x27;s Lynn. It is thus claimed that during periods of heavy rainfall Norfolk can be considered to be an island. The explanation of this oddity is that the valley in which the rivers rise was formed not by these rivers, but by water spilling from the periglacial lake known as Lake Fenland. This was a periglacial lake of the Devensian glacial period, fifteen or twenty thousand years ago. The ice sheet closed the natural drainage from the Vale of Pickering, the Humber and The Wash so that a lake of a complex shape formed in the Vale of Pickering, the Yorkshire Ouse valley, the lower Trent valley and the Fenland basin. This valley was its spillway into the southern North Sea basin, thence to the English Channel basin.

The river rises close to the contour, and flows in an easterly direction though the towns of Diss, Bungay and Beccles. From its source it forms the southern boundary of Bressingham and Roydon before it reaches Diss. At Scole it is crossed by the course of a Roman road, with the modern A140 bypass just to the east. There is a weir at Billingford and Billingford Windmill is situated a little to the north of the river. Beyond Billingford Bridge the River Dove, flowing northwards from Eye, joins on the southern bank, the Mid Suffolk Footpath crosses and the river drops below the contour at another weir. It turns to the north-east to reach Brockdish and Needham before passing to the south of Harleston. There are several lakes on the south bank, the largest covering , which were once Weybread Gravel Pits, but are now used for fishing.

Below the lakes are the remains of St Mary&#x27;s Priory, Mendham, a Cluniac priory and the extensive drained area of Mendham Marshes. Mendham, which is the birthplace of the artist Alfred Munnings, lies on the Suffolk bank, Wortwell is in Norfolk, and Homersfield is again in Suffolk. In 1869, Homersfield Bridge, one of the first bridges to be constructed from concrete and iron was built across the river here. It was commissioned by Sir Shafto Adair, had a span of and predated the introduction of true reinforced concrete by several years. It is now the oldest concrete bridge in England and is a Grade II* listed structure. Road traffic was diverted onto a new bridge in 1970 and the former structure was acquired by Norfolk County Council in 1994. They passed it on to the Norfolk Historic Buildings Trust, which managed its restoration in 1995, which was funded by grants from English Heritage, Blue Circle Industries and councils at county, district and local level.
Opposite Homersfield, on the Norfolk side of the river lie the parishes of Alburgh, Denton and Earsham. Next on the Suffolk bank is Flixton the site of a World War II USAF bomber base and the Norfolk and Suffolk Aviation Museum. At Earsham the Otter Trust had one of its three UK centres, which opened in 1978 and closed in 2006, having successfully boosted otter numbers on the river.

At Bungay, the historic head of navigation, the Waveney forms a wide oxbow meander, carrying with it the Norfolk/Suffolk border. Within this loop lies the long-established Bungay and Waveney Valley golf course. Next, on the Norfolk bank, come Ditchingham, Broome and Ellingham before Geldeston, where an isolated pub stands next to the site of a lock, now replaced by a sluice. This is the current limit of navigation for craft larger than a rowing or paddling boat and at this point the Waveney becomes a tidal river. A short way further along is a dyke that leads to the village. On the Suffolk side are found the parishes of Mettingham. Shipmeadow and Barsham. On the Norfolk side Gillingham comes next before the river gathers waters at Beccles, as it enters the Broads. Although the old town bridge here restricts navigation to craft with an air draft of less than , its quay beyond that abruptly changes the nature of the river from a gentle rural feature to a gateway to the North Sea. Beccles was a fishing port for many years and the parents of Lord Nelson were married in the church of St Michael. The river then meanders past Barnby Broad and Marshes SSSI and Burgh St Peter to Somerleyton. Here Oulton Dyke branches off the Waveney to Oulton Broad towards Lowestoft. A sea lock, known as Mutford Lock, divides fresh from seawater and links Oulton Broad with Lake Lothing and the North Sea. This lock is operated by Sentinel Enterprises Limited and will allow traffic to pass through.

At Somerleyton the Lowestoft to Norwich railway line crosses the Waveney on a swing bridge, while at St Olaves, the Haddiscoe Cut branches off left to connect the Rivers Yare and Waveney. The Cut was excavated in the 19th century to provide a direct route between Lowestoft Docks and Norwich. Finally the Waveney flows past Burgh Castle into Breydon Water at the confluence of the two rivers. The river Yare continues through Breydon Water to reach the sea at Great Yarmouth.

There was a special version of the Norfolk wherry in use on the Waveney, with boats measuring no more than . There were also steam wherries.

Daniel Defoe enlivens this account of the Waveney&#x27;s Broads course:The River Waveney is a considerable river, and of a deep and full channel, navigable for large barges as high as Beccles; it runs for a course of about fifty miles, between the two counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, as a boundary to both; and pushing on, tho&#x27; with a gentle stream, towards the sea, no one would doubt, but, that when they see the river growing broader and deeper, and going directly towards the sea, even to the edge of the beach; that is to say, within a mile of the main ocean; no stranger, I say, but would expect to see its entrance into the sea at that place, and a noble harbour for ships at the mouth of it; when on a sudden, the land rising high by the sea-side, crosses the head of the river, like a dam, checks the whole course of it, and it returns, bending its course west, for two miles, or thereabouts; and then turning north, thro&#x27; another long course of meadows (joining to those just now mention&#x27;d) seeks out the River Yare, that it may join its water with hers, and find their way to the sea together.

==Navigation==

The River Waverney was improved for navigation under an Act of Parliament obtained in 1670, which empowered five traders from Bungay and one from Downham Market to carry out the work. This included the construction of three locks, at Geldeston, Ellingham and Wainford, to extend navigation as far as Bungay Staithe. The navigation remained in private hands, and was not under the control of the Yarmouth Commissioners, who were responsible for the lower river. A second Act obtained in 1772 ensured that Suffolk magistrates received a 5 per cent share of all tolls obtained from the carriage of coal, with which to maintain the Waveney. Ownership was in the hands of a merchant from Bungay at the end of the eighteenth century, and was later bought by William Butcher. When St Olave&#x27;s bridge needed to be rebuilt in 1847, he explained that although he owned it, he had let out the collection of tolls, and such matters were dealt with by the judges at Bury St Edmunds Assizes. In 1848, he attempted to set up the Bungay Navigation Tontine Co., which would buy the rights to levy tolls and trade on the river, using a tontine, but the scheme failed to attract sufficient investors to become viable. In 1889 ownership was transferred to W. D. Walker of Bungay, a merchant and maltster. The firm was the first owner of a wherry called &quot;Albion&quot;, now owned by the Norfolk Wherry Trust. From 1919 to 1934, Watney, Combe, Reid and Co. controlled the navigation.

The short section of the river from Haddiscoe to Burgh Ferry was part of a grand scheme to link Norwich to the sea at Lowestoft. The scheme originated in 1818, but was opposed by the merchants of Yarmouth and it was not until 28 May 1827 that an Act of Parliament authorised the Norwich and Lowestoft Navigation Company, giving then powers to raise £100,000, with an additional £50,000 if required. From Burgh Ferry, boats would use a widened Oulton Dyke to reach Oulton Broad and a new sea lock would be constructed to link the broad to Lake Lothing. This had four sets of gates, so that it could be used at all states of the tide, was capable of holding vessels which were and used a system of sluices to enable the channel through Lake Lothing to be flushed with water from Oulton Broad. Completed in 1829, it was demonstrated in 1831 and although four operations of the sluices were estimated to have removed 10,000 tons of gravel and shingle out to sea, its subsequent operation was not as effective.

In the other direction, construction of Haddiscoe Cut began, to link the river at Haddiscoe to the River Yare at Reedham, enabling vessels from Norwich to bypass Yarmouth. With funds running low, a decision was taken to borrow the additional £50,000 which the enabling Act allowed and so a request was made to the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission for this amount. Work was completed on the cut and the upgrading of the river to Norwich and the formal opening took place on 30 September 1833. The venture was a commercial failure, as development of Norwich as a port did not occur and Lowestoft harbour was subject to silting. With income failing to match expenditure, the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission could not be repaid, so they took over the navigation in 1842 and sold it to the railway contractor Sir Samuel Morton Peto.

With the decline in the use of wherries for commercial trade on the rivers prior to the Second World War, navigation ceased on several stretches of the Broads, including the section of the river from Geldeston Lock to Bungay, where navigation rights were removed in 1934. Geldeston Lock, which is also known as Shipmeadow Lock, gradually deteriorated, and in 2013 it was restored in a joint project by the River Waveney Trust and the Inland Waterways Association. During the restoration work, a carved stone showing that the lock was previously restored in 1910 was found, as was a gold wedding ring. Wainford and Ellingham locks have since been converted into sluices, but the Environment Agency has negotiated with local landowners to allow the use of this section by canoes and unpowered craft. To aid this, it has improved the facilities for portaging boats at the locks.

Mutford lock links Oulton Broad to Lake Lothing and is the only working lock on the whole of the Broads. Two swing bridges carried the Lowestoft to Ipswich railway line and the A1117 road over the cut to the east of the lock. The road bridge has since been replaced with a single leaf bascule bridge in August 1992. The lock was refurbished in 1992 and was managed by Waveney District Council, but there were discussions taking place in 2009 to transfer it to the Broads Authority, who manage the rest of the Broads. Since 2011, day-to-day management has been handled on behalf of the council by Sentinel Enterprises, which is part of Sentinel Leisure Trust. They also operate Oulton Broad Yacht Station.

==Milling==
In common with most of the rivers of Suffolk and Norfolk, the Waveney is relatively flat, falling around on the section between Hoxne Mill, near to its junction with the River Dove, and Beccles Bridge, where the river is tidal. These points are apart, giving an average fall of 1 in 1,970. Despite these factors, the river has powered at least 15 mills, evidence for some of which indicates that the river has been used for this purpose for over 900 years. Most milled corn for flour or animal feed, but some were used for other purposes. Of those that remain, all are in private ownership.

The mill furthest upstream was Scole Flax Mill, although it was not a watermill, being powered by steam. It was built by C.F. Costerton in 1854, in an attempt to alleviate poverty during the agricultural depressions of the 1840s, which followed the cessation of war with France. He persuaded farmers to grow flax, and provided the facilities to process it, both at the mill and at a factory in Eye run by his business partner Peter Naylor. The flax was grown for its fibres, which were used to make linen sheeting, sacking and rope, and for its seeds, from which linseed oil was obtained. Production was encouraged by presenting a cup each year to the farmer who had produced the highest yield on of land. With the mill affected by a decline in local supplies and overseas competition, it closed in 1881, after which the machinery was removed and the buildings demolished.

The first watermill was at Hoxne. The present building was erected in 1846, and consists of a brick ground floor, with two storeys above that which are timber framed and weatherboarded, and a slate roof. It replaced a structure built in 1749, but that was not the first mill at Hoxne, since a mill is shown on Kirby&#x27;s map of Suffolk, dated 1736, and two mills are mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, although this probably meant that there were two sets of stones. The last two buildings were variously used for milling corn, the production of textiles, and for processing flax at different points in their history. The mill ceased to be used after it was sold in 1968, but retains its wheel and some of the machinery. Both the mill and the adjacent house are grade II listed structures.

Syleham Mill is first mentioned in connection with some monks from near Thetford, who founded a monastery in 1020. The final structure to occupy the site was built some time after 1779. Initially it had six sets of stones and two wheels, powered by a fall in the river, but in 1849, Henry Warne moved his business from Hoxne Mill to Syleham, and used the mill to power looms on which a coarse cloth made from linen and cotton called drabbet was woven. 96 people were employed there in 1855, but although manufacture of drabbet ceased in 1914, the adjacent factory continued to be used for the making of clothing. The mill and part of the factory were destroyed by fire in 1928, but the factory was rebuilt, and continued to produce men&#x27;s garments until 1989, when it was closed with the loss of 100 jobs. The next mill was Luck&#x27;s Mill, about which very little is known, but it was shown on Kirby&#x27;s map of 1736, and was demolished in the 1880s or 1890s.

Needham Mill also had ecclesiastical connections, as it was owned by Sibson Abbey, a Cistercian abbey founded in 1150. It was sold in 1611, and appears on Kirby&#x27;s map of 1736. Although known as Needham Mill, it is on the Suffolk side of the river, in the parish of Weybread. Milling continued until 1934, when the mill was sold. The ironwork and wheel were sold for scrap in 1940, and it was converted into a house in 1971. The weir and sluice were rebuilt in 1963 at a cost of £12,714. The work created a gauging station for flow measurement, and increased the capacity of the channels to reduce the risk of flooding. Weybread mill is also noted in the Domesday survey. Both Needham and Weybread were run by William Mann in 1779, and Weybread mill was run by a miller and baker called Jacob Stanton from 1785. He became bankrupt in 1794, and the sale details indicate that there were two wheels driving five pairs of stones, and a newly invented water-powered engine for cutting hay and straw. Details from its sale in 1918 indicate that one wheel was in diameter by wide, making it the biggest wheel on the Waveney, while the other was in diameter. It had five storeys, and sold for £1,250, but burnt down two years later and was not rebuilt.

Mendham had a mill in 1086, although the present building was constructed in 1807, and was extended in 1871, when a grasshopper beam engine was installed to supplement the water wheel, which only had a fall of , when water levels were low. The machinery was modernised in 1905, when the number of stones was reduced from nine to four, to make way for a roller plant. The beam engine was replaced in 1923, having been driven and maintained for over 50 years by Jimmy Souter. During this time it never broke down, and Souter died once it was dismantled. It was replaced by a Lister diesel engine, and then a Ruston and Hornsby engine. Part of the building was converted into a house in 1938, and the mill continued to operate until 1949. The rights to use the water were given up in the 1950s, in exchange for the provision of mains electricity to the premises. Both the mill and the house are grade II listed. There may also have been a paper mill at Mendham, but the evidence is inconclusive.

Limbourne Mill in Wortwell is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and was owned by the Benedictine Nunnery at Bungay. It appears in documents from 1334, 1356 and 1364, and in 1846 it was noted in a history of Suffolk that Limbourne would be unknown were it not for the water mill, which was called Limber Mill at the time. It continued in use until at least 1933, but was unused by 1949. Some of the original machinery survives, and the mill is grade II listed. Homersfield Mill is attested in 1086 and by documents from every century from the fourteenth onwards. The river bank by the weir collapsed in the early 1920s, and was not repaired, resulting in the mill and cottage deteriorating and being demolished in 1927.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Waveney system was as follows in 2019.
The reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge affecting most of the river, physical modification of channels, and poor management of agricultural and rural land adjacent to the river system. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which had not previously been included in the assessment.
