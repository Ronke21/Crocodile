<text>Homewood is a city in southeastern Jefferson County, Alabama, United States. It is a suburb of Birmingham, located on the other side of Red Mountain due south of the city center. The population was 26,414 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Early history and development===
In 1800, the first settlers arrived in the area that is now known as Homewood. However, the area&#x27;s population would not grow significantly until a cholera epidemic ravaged the city of Birmingham in 1873, an issue only made worse by the financial crisis brought on by the Panic of 1873. (See Timeline of Birmingham, Alabama).

Seeking new beginnings and safer living spaces, many Birmingham residents began moving out of the city, buying up land and developing communities in the surrounding areas. Many of the smaller communities which would eventually become Homewood were developed during this time period, including Rosedale, Grove Park, Edgewood, and Oak Grove.

Edgewood saw the greatest amount of development. The community had an electric railway leading to downtown Birmingham by 1911 and a man-made lake by 1915. The lake was created by the construction of a dam along Shades Creek near Columbiana Road. Two parallel roads were graded on either side of the lake with the intention of creating a race track around the lake, however these plans never came to fruition. The roads eventually became Lakeshore Drive and South Lakeshore Drive.

===Incorporation===
On December 29, 1926, a local attorney named Charles Rice started a movement to merge several of the communities surrounding Birmingham. In September of the same year, Rosedale, Edgewood, and Grove Park voted to incorporate under the name Homewood. The city of Hollywood, Alabama was annexed into Homewood in 1929.

In 1955, Oak Grove was also annexed into Homewood.

===Great Depression and World War II===
The Great Depression, beginning in 1929, greatly damaged Homewood&#x27;s economy. Additionally, a polio epidemic, which sickened 80 children in Homewood, struck around the same time. However, the regional community and economy began to recover with the outbreak of World War II and the accompanying boom in Birmingham&#x27;s steel industry, where production ramped up to support the war effort. Partly due to the steel boom, Homewood&#x27;s population increased by 74% between 1940 and 1950.

===Civil rights era===
In 1959, Homewood voters defeated a move by Birmingham to annex the city. In July 1964, a second annexation attempt allegedly succeeded, but voting issues and lawsuits caused the Alabama Supreme Court to rule the election null and void on September 9, 1966 (See &quot;City of Birmingham v. Bouldin&quot;). In a special election on December 13, 1966, another vote for annexation failed with 65% of Homewood residents voting against it.

Homewood avoided the worst of the turmoil associated with the Civil Rights Movement and, more specifically, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference&#x27;s 1963 Birmingham campaign. However, in September 1963, the &quot;Shades Valley Sun&quot; newspaper reported on a racially motivated bombing on Central Avenue in Rosedale.

Homewood broke away created its own school system separate from the Jefferson County school system in 1970, opening the new Homewood High School in December 1972.

===Hollywood===
Hollywood is a former town annexed into Homewood, Alabama, in 1929. A historic district of much of the area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Hollywood Historic District. The district is roughly bounded by U.S. Highway 31, U.S. Highway 280, and Lakeshore Drive and is significant for the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style of surviving houses and other buildings.

Clyde Nelson began developing Hollywood Boulevard as a residential subdivision in 1926. He employed a sales force of 75, armed with the memorable slogan &quot;Out of the Smoke Zone, Into the Ozone&quot;, to entice Birmingham residents over Red Mountain. Architect George P. Turner designed many of the new homes in the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, which had become fashionably linked with the glamour of Hollywood, California in the early days of the motion picture industry there. Turner also nodded to the English Tudor style which was already widespread in Birmingham and over the mountain.

The Hollywood Country Club on Lakeshore Drive (destroyed in 1984 by fire) and the American Legion Post 134 (originally Hollywood&#x27;s Town Hall) were also built at this time.

In order to support his new development, Nelson created the area&#x27;s first autobus line and extended the first natural gas pipeline into Shades Valley.

Hollywood incorporated as a town on January 14, 1927 with Clarence Lloyd as its first and only mayor. The town was annexed into Homewood on October 14, 1929. The Great Depression virtually ended development of the subdivision.

In 2002, the Hollywood Historic District was registered with the National Register of Historic Places, and is home to The American Institute of Architects (AIA)-nominated houses like 11 Bonita Drive. The listing includes 412 contributing buildings and one contributing site, over a area.

<doc id="104786" wikidata="Q79950" url="?curid=104786" title="Hoover, Alabama">
<text>Hoover is a city in the Jefferson and Shelby counties in north central Alabama, United States. Hoover is the largest suburban city in Alabama and the 6th largest city in Alabama. The population was 92,606 at the 2020 census. Hoover is part of the Birmingham, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area and is also included in the Birmingham-Cullman-Talladega, AL Combined Statistical Area. Hoover&#x27;s territory is along the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.

The Birmingham Barons Minor League Baseball team, which traces its history to 1885, played its home games at the 10,800-seat Hoover Metropolitan Stadium from 1988 through 2013, when it moved to Regions Field in the Parkside District of Birmingham.

==History==

This suburban area near the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains had been known as the Green Valley community since the 1930s; it was mostly a bedroom or residential community into the late 1970s and early 1980s. The City of Hoover was incorporated in 1967, named for William H. Hoover (1890–1979), a local insurance company owner.

On September 8, 1980, the city annexed the Riverchase business and residential community, gaining large office buildings, employers, and workers to increase the city&#x27;s tax base. When Interstate I-459 was opened, a major interchange with Interstate I-65 was constructed within the borders of Hoover, improving access.

In 1986 the Riverchase Galleria multi-use complex opened; it has significantly increased the tax revenue for the city. It has also attracted new residents and businesses to the area. The city has grown extremely fast, aided by its annexations of territory as well as new developments. The city has expanded its facilities, and now operates a Municipal Center, Library, and Public Safety Center. The city expects to continue to increase in population, which has risen significantly since 2008. It numbered 92,606 as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , is water.

Many major highways pass through the city limits, including I-65, I-459, and U.S. Route 31. Via I-65 or US-31, downtown Birmingham is north, and Montgomery is south. Via I-459, Atlanta, GA is east, and Tuscaloosa is west.

==Government==

The municipal government has operated under the Mayor-Council form of government since incorporation. The Mayor and City Council are elected on a non-partisan basis to concurrent four-year terms of office, which begin on October 1 of election year. Policy-making and legislative authority is vested in the City Council, which consists of seven &quot;at-large&quot; elected members (prior to 2004, the council consisted of five at-large members.) (Candidates for at-large elections must gain a majority of voters; such a system has been found in other cities in Alabama to limit the ability of minority voters to elect candidates of their choice.)

The city council is responsible for considering local resolutions and ordinances, adopting an annual budget, and appointing members to local boards and committees. The Mayor is responsible for carrying out and enforcing the city&#x27;s policies and ordinances.

==Economy==
The Riverchase Galleria shopping-hotel-office complex generates tax revenues for the city; it is also the location of numerous retail, hotel, and office workers. The Riverchase Office Park, and other office parks and buildings throughout Hoover, house many large corporations. Major shopping centers in the city include Riverchase Galleria on US 31, Patton Creek on SR 150, and Village at Lee Branch on US 280. The Central Business District is intersected by US 31, SR 150, and US 280. I-65 and I-459 intersect in the city.

===Primary and secondary schools===
Hoover is served by Hoover City Schools. It has ten elementary schools, three middle schools, and two high schools, Spain Park High School and Hoover High School. Both schools have ranked high for excellent academics, being rated close to the top five hundred schools in the country. During the 2022–2023 school year, some 2,841 students enrolled in Hoover High School, 1,503 in Spain Park High School, with a total of 13,557 students in the Hoover City School system. Spain Park received the National Blue Ribbon Award in 2008.

Berry Middle School, which served as the city&#x27;s first high school before the present Hoover High was constructed, was closed after the 2005–2006 academic year. Students were moved to a new Berry Middle School constructed near the site of Spain Park High School. A poll of residents in 2007 favored selling the school, possibly to the independent Shades Mountain Christian School. Simmons Middle School and Bumpus Middle School are the city&#x27;s other middle schools.

Given the population expansion, the city built Riverchase Elementary to relieve overcrowding of some schools. The student population bubble is advancing in the system, and in the 2011–2012 academic year, Bumpus Middle School and its students were relocated to the former freshman center of Hoover High School. The former Bumpus site became Brock&#x27;s Gap Intermediate School in 2011. The former Berry site became the current Bumpus Middle School in 2011. Brock&#x27;s Gap served 5th and 6th graders until 2018 when Hoover Rezoning went into effect. They now serve 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders. Bumpus Middle School served only 7th and 8th graders until 2018 because of Hoover Rezoning. They now serve 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.

==Industrial history==
Although the Hueytown area has a history of farming, it has been a part of both the steel and coal mining industries in Jefferson County.

William &amp; Joseph Woodward formed The Woodward Iron Company on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1881. With William as company president and Joseph as company secretary, the brothers purchased the plantation of Fleming Jordan. The plantation had originally been developed by his father, Mortimer Jordan, in 1828. The plantation included portions of present-day Hueytown and was one of the largest cotton plantations in the area.

On the former site of Mrs. Jordan&#x27;s rose garden, Woodward Furnace No. 1 began operation on August 17, 1883. A second furnace went into blast in January 1887 and the two furnaces had a daily output of 165 tons. A mine also went into operation in the Dolomite community, which is today mostly within the City of Hueytown. By 1909, there was a third furnace and a daily capacity of 250,000 tons with a workforce of 2000 men on the payroll.

By the 1920s Woodward Iron&#x27;s many expansions made it one of the nation&#x27;s largest suppliers of pig iron. Joseph&#x27;s son, A. H. (Rick) Woodward, had become Chairman of the Board of Woodward Iron, and was one of the most prominent citizens of Alabama. He is probably best remembered as the owner of the Birmingham Barons minor league baseball team and the namesake of Rickwood Field, the nation&#x27;s oldest professional baseball park still in use.

In 1968, Mead Corporation acquired Woodward Iron just as the steel industry was going into decline. In 1973, the last blast furnace closed, and Koppers Corporation bought the remaining coke production plant. Eventually, even Koppers had closed coke production as well. Much of the site today has been re-developed for lighter industrial use.

Coal mining began about the start of the 20th century at Virginia Mines. Today this section of Hueytown contains mostly subdivisions of homes (Virginia Estates and Edenwood). However, some of the original buildings from its mining past remain, including the superintendent&#x27;s house, multiple supervisors&#x27; houses, and two company-built churches.

Some source say veteran prospector Truman H. Aldrich assembled these lands as part of his extensive coal properties, others cite two red-headed brothers, George and E. T. Shuler, as having opened the Virginia Mine in 1902. Having recently arrived from Virginia City, Nevada, they named their new mine after that western city. A mine disaster in February 1905 caused extensive damage. An underground explosion, one of the worst recorded mining disasters in Alabama history, entombed the entire day crew and caved in the mine entrance. When rescuers finally cleared the 1 shaft, they found 106 men dead and 20 dead mules.

In 1936, Republic Steel purchased the mine. It continued to be worked until September 1953, when it closed permanently.

==Government==
The City of Hueytown was incorporated on December 3, 1959, and operates under a Mayor-Council form of government. The Mayor is elected to a four-year term. The five City Council members are also elected to four-year terms. Originally elected at-large, the city changed to single-member districts in the 1990s which resulted in the creation of one majority-minority council district. Neither position is term-limited.

==Schools and education history==
The Hueytown area has been served by many schools over the past one hundred years. Most of these have been public schools of The Jefferson County School System which was founded in 1898. However, the first established school in the community was in August 1874, when several families gathered to build a small log building that served as both a church and school. That structure was located on the hill behind present-day Pleasant Ridge Baptist Church. A later grammar school was built on Upper Wickstead Road but burned down in 1907. The following year, Hueytown Grammar School opened with just four teachers for its 100 students. Also located across the street from Pleasant Ridge Baptist Church it faced Dabbs Avenue. The school was replaced with a larger building in 1935 which faced Hueytown Road. That entire structure burned to the ground on the night of March 3, 1949. The present Hueytown Elementary School, which has been expanded many times, first opened in the fall of 1950.

The present Hueytown Intermediate School opened to the students in the fall of 2020. (November 2 or 9)

Other schools serving the city include: Hueytown High School, Hueytown Middle School (formerly Pittman Middle School and Pittman Junior High), Concord Elementary School and North Highland Elementary School. Four private religious schools, Deeper Life Academy, Garywood Christian School, Brooklane Baptist Academy, and Rock Creek Academy are located in Hueytown.

Other schools that served Hueytown in years past have long since been closed. They included Virginia Mines School, Rosa Zinnerman Elementary, and Bell High School. When an F5 tornado destroyed Oak Grove High School and Oak Grove Elementary School on April 8, 1998, students from the Oak Grove high school grades were temporarily relocated to the former Bell School campus until their new school reopened two years later.

Recently the Hueytown High School Marching, Symphonic, and Jazz Bands have gained some prestige by playing at the Alabama Music Educators Association (AMEA) and a dual concert with the University of Alabama at Birmingham&#x27;s Symphonic and Wind ensembles.
* The Hueytown High School mascot is the Golden Gophers, which came from the Minnesota Golden Gophers National Championship football team, which won the National Championship in 1960, the same year Hueytown was incorporated.

==Sports and recreation==
The abbreviation HYT (HueYTown) has become a popular term of reference for Hueytown among some of the residents; it is constantly used for sports. (for example HYT football).

Hueytown High School&#x27;s football team made it to the Alabama State Playoffs in 1974, 1975, 1995, and 2004. They also made the playoffs in 2006, 2007, and 2008, marking the first time in school history to make three straight appearances. The 2010 team set a school record for wins by going 11–2, but the record was broken the next year by Jameis Winston and company by going 13–1. On June 18, 2009 Hueytown High School&#x27;s football Coach Jeff Smith resigned. Spain Park High School assistant coach Matt Scott became the new head coach on July 7, 2009. The team made the playoffs once again in the 2010 and 2011 season under Coach Scott. Hueytown also made it to the 2016 state playoffs under Coach Scott Mansell, who was in his third year as head coach.

HHS&#x27;s softball team has won the Alabama State Softball championship three times in four years: 2005 and 2006 as a 5A school and 2008 as a 6A school under Coach Lissa Walker. They won again in 2011 as a 5A school. After the 2011 season, Coach Walker resigned and was hired as the new coach for the Vestavia softball team. Coach Christie McGuirk was hired in Coach Walker&#x27;s place to be the new coach for the 2011 season.

In 1974, the Hueytown High School Wrestling Team won the 4A State Championship under the guidance of then head-wrestling coach, Tony Morton.

Hueytown High School implemented its soccer program in the spring of 2014.

In addition to the public school sports programs, Hueytown offers many other community sports programs. For decades the city has enjoyed a very strong Dixie Youth Baseball program for all eligible age groups. Its Dixie Youth teams use facilities at Hueytown&#x27;s Bud Newell Park and have seen several of its players eventually make it to the Major Leagues. The city also has a very strong girls fastpitch program that is based at Allison-Bonnett Girls Softball Park, also a city facility. Its Angels league All-Star team won the Dixie World Series championship in the summer of 2003 and its 6U All-Stars won the Alabama State Championship in the summer of 2009. Hueytown also has a Swim Club and a youth football program.

Hueytown also has Youth Soccer which started in 2003.

Hueytown is also home to the Central Alabama Boys &amp; Girls Club, a multimillion-dollar facility that provides a variety of sports and recreation opportunities for the youth of the area, focusing primarily on after school and summer programs. It routinely serves more than 300 children each day.

==The Alabama Gang==
Hueytown was home to one of the dominant racing groups in NASCAR, the Alabama Gang. The city&#x27;s main thoroughfare, Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive, takes its name from drivers Bobby Allison, Donnie Allison, Davey Allison, Clifford Allison, and Neil Bonnett. The Alabama Gang also includes racing legend Charles &quot;Red&quot; Farmer. Though not considered a member of The Alabama Gang, Bobby and Donnie&#x27;s older brother Eddie Allison had an active role in NASCAR for many years as a respected engine builder and still resides in Hueytown. His son, Jacob, is a radio personality on Birmingham, Alabama station WJOX. He also resides in Hueytown.
* Bobby and Donnie Allison were originally from the Miami, Florida area; another member, Red Farmer, was a Nashville, Tennessee native but had raced in the Miami area before moving to Hueytown.

Because of its established motorsports roots, Hueytown was chosen as BMW Motorsport&#x27;s initial North American base of operations before its first season with the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) in 1975.

==Hueytown Hum==
Beginning in late 1991 residents of Hueytown, and other nearby communities, reported hearing a droning low frequency hum at irregular intervals. The bizarre noises momentarily gained national attention and were reported in the &quot;New York Times&quot; in April 1992. In a logical conclusion town officials and many residents suspected the source of the hum was a massive $7 million mine ventilation fan with blades in diameter.
From local reports and an informal investigation by &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;, the fan operated by Jim Walter Resources was generally thought to be the culprit. However, JWR (then owned by a subsidiary of KKR) was in bankruptcy proceedings and denied its fan was the source. Following an inconclusive series of studies the hum subsided later in the year, never to return.

<text>Kimberly is a city in Jefferson County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 3,841.

==History==
The city of Kimberly developed around a stagecoach station built in the 1830s; it remained in service until 1865. At this time, the settlement was known as Kennelsville. The city then became known as Jefferson, probably after the nearby Old Jefferson coal mine, until the late 1880s. In 1888, the town&#x27;s post office was relocated to nearby Morris. In 1905, the town voted to change its name to Kimberly because another Alabama town had already claimed the name Jefferson. The town had a population of around 900 by 1910. Local coal mines were primary employers in Kimberly and were active through the 1940s, gradually closing down during the 1950s. Another significant employer in Kimberly was the Dixie Firebrick Company, founded in the 1930s; it was later bought out by A.P. Green Refractories Company. This facility shut down sometime in the mid-1970s. The city officially incorporated in 1952. Many city records and history were lost in a fire at the city hall in 1989. Beginning June 29, 2011, due to the population increasing from 1,801 persons in 2000 to 2,711 in 2010, the town began operating as a city, per Alabama law.

<text>In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a non-negative integer , also called an integer partition, is a way of writing as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. (If order matters, the sum becomes a composition.) For example, can be partitioned in five distinct ways:
:
:

The only partition of zero is the empty sum, having no parts.

The order-dependent composition is the same partition as , and the two distinct compositions and represent the same partition as .

An individual summand in a partition is called a part. The number of partitions of is given by the partition function . So . The notation means that is a partition of .

Partitions can be graphically visualized with Young diagrams or Ferrers diagrams. They occur in a number of branches of mathematics and physics, including the study of symmetric polynomials and of the symmetric group and in group representation theory in general.

==Examples==
The seven partitions of 5 are
* 5
* 4 + 1
* 3 + 2
* 3 + 1 + 1
* 2 + 2 + 1
* 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
* 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

Some authors treat a partition as a decreasing sequence of summands, rather than an expression with plus signs. For example, the partition 2 + 2 + 1 might instead be written as the tuple or in the even more compact form where the superscript indicates the number of repetitions of a part.

This multiplicity notation for a partition can be written alternatively as formula_1, where is the number of 1&#x27;s, is the number of 2&#x27;s, etc. (Components with may be omitted.) For example, in this notation, the partitions of 5 are written formula_2, and formula_3.

==Diagrammatic representations of partitions==
There are two common diagrammatic methods to represent partitions: as Ferrers diagrams, named after Norman Macleod Ferrers, and as Young diagrams, named after Alfred Young. Both have several possible conventions; here, we use &quot;English notation&quot;, with diagrams aligned in the upper-left corner.

===Ferrers diagram ===
The partition 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 of the number 14 can be represented by the following diagram:

The 14 circles are lined up in 4 rows, each having the size of a part of the partition.
The diagrams for the 5 partitions of the number 4 are shown below:

===Young diagram===
An alternative visual representation of an integer partition is its &quot;Young diagram&quot; (often also called a Ferrers diagram). Rather than representing a partition with dots, as in the Ferrers diagram, the Young diagram uses boxes or squares. Thus, the Young diagram for the partition 5 + 4 + 1 is
while the Ferrers diagram for the same partition is

While this seemingly trivial variation does not appear worthy of separate mention, Young diagrams turn out to be extremely useful in the study of symmetric functions and group representation theory: filling the boxes of Young diagrams with numbers (or sometimes more complicated objects) obeying various rules leads to a family of objects called Young tableaux, and these tableaux have combinatorial and representation-theoretic significance. As a type of shape made by adjacent squares joined together, Young diagrams are a special kind of polyomino.

==Partition function==
The partition function formula_4 counts the partitions of a non-negative integer formula_5. For instance, formula_6 because the integer formula_7 has the five partitions formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, and formula_7.
The values of this function for formula_13 are:
:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, 56, 77, 101, 135, 176, 231, 297, 385, 490, 627, 792, 1002, 1255, 1575, 1958, 2436, 3010, 3718, 4565, 5604, ... .

The generating function of formula_14 is 
:formula_15

No closed-form expression for the partition function is known, but it has both asymptotic expansions that accurately approximate it and recurrence relations by which it can be calculated exactly. It grows as an exponential function of the square root of its argument., as follows:

:formula_16 as formula_17

In 1937, Hans Rademacher found a way to represent the partition function formula_4 by the convergent series

formula_19
where

formula_20
and formula_21 is the Dedekind sum.

The multiplicative inverse of its generating function is the Euler function; by Euler&#x27;s pentagonal number theorem this function is an alternating sum of pentagonal number powers of its argument.

:formula_22

Srinivasa Ramanujan discovered that the partition function has nontrivial patterns in modular arithmetic, now known as Ramanujan&#x27;s congruences. For instance, whenever the decimal representation of formula_5 ends in the digit 4 or 9, the number of partitions of formula_5 will be divisible by 5.

==Restricted partitions==
In both combinatorics and number theory, families of partitions subject to various restrictions are often studied. This section surveys a few such restrictions.

===Conjugate and self-conjugate partitions===

If we flip the diagram of the partition 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 along its main diagonal, we obtain another partition of 14:

By turning the rows into columns, we obtain the partition 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 of the number 14. Such partitions are said to be &quot;conjugate&quot; of one another. In the case of the number 4, partitions 4 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 are conjugate pairs, and partitions 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 + 1 are conjugate of each other. Of particular interest are partitions, such as 2 + 2, which have themselves as conjugate. Such partitions are said to be &quot;self-conjugate&quot;.

Claim: The number of self-conjugate partitions is the same as the number of partitions with distinct odd parts.

Proof (outline): The crucial observation is that every odd part can be &quot;folded&quot; in the middle to form a self-conjugate diagram:

One can then obtain a bijection between the set of partitions with distinct odd parts and the set of self-conjugate partitions, as illustrated by the following example:

===Odd parts and distinct parts ===
Among the 22 partitions of the number 8, there are 6 that contain only &quot;odd parts&quot;:
* 7 + 1
* 5 + 3
* 5 + 1 + 1 + 1
* 3 + 3 + 1 + 1
* 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
* 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

Alternatively, we could count partitions in which no number occurs more than once. Such a partition is called a &quot;partition with distinct parts&quot;. If we count the partitions of 8 with distinct parts, we also obtain 6:
* 8
* 7 + 1 
* 6 + 2
* 5 + 3
* 5 + 2 + 1
* 4 + 3 + 1

This is a general property. For each positive number, the number of partitions with odd parts equals the number of partitions with distinct parts, denoted by &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). This result was proved by Leonhard Euler in 1748 and later was generalized as Glaisher&#x27;s theorem.

For every type of restricted partition there is a corresponding function for the number of partitions satisfying the given restriction. An important example is &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) (partitions into distinct parts). The first few values of &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) are (starting with &quot;q&quot;(0)=1):
:1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, ... .

The generating function for &quot;q&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is given by 
:formula_25

The pentagonal number theorem gives a recurrence for &quot;q&quot;: 
:&quot;q&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;q&quot;(&quot;k&quot; − 1) + &quot;q&quot;(&quot;k&quot; − 2) − &quot;q&quot;(&quot;k&quot; − 5) − &quot;q&quot;(&quot;k&quot; − 7) + &quot;q&quot;(&quot;k&quot; − 12) + &quot;q&quot;(&quot;k&quot; − 15) − &quot;q&quot;(&quot;k&quot; − 22) − ...
where &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; is (−1)&quot;m&quot; if &quot;k&quot; = 3&quot;m&quot;2 − &quot;m&quot; for some integer &quot;m&quot; and is 0 otherwise.

===Restricted part size or number of parts===

By taking conjugates, the number of partitions of into exactly &quot;k&quot; parts is equal to the number of partitions of in which the largest part has size . The function satisfies the recurrence
with initial values and if and and are not both zero.

One recovers the function &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) by

:formula_26

One possible generating function for such partitions, taking &quot;k&quot; fixed and &quot;n&quot; variable, is 
: formula_27

More generally, if &quot;T&quot; is a set of positive integers then the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot;, all of whose parts belong to &quot;T&quot;, has generating function 
:formula_28
This can be used to solve change-making problems (where the set &quot;T&quot; specifies the available coins). As two particular cases, one has that the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; in which all parts are 1 or 2 (or, equivalently, the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; into 1 or 2 parts) is
:formula_29
and the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; in which all parts are 1, 2 or 3 (or, equivalently, the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot; into at most three parts) is the nearest integer to (&quot;n&quot; + 3)2 / 12.

===Partitions in a rectangle and Gaussian binomial coefficients===

One may also simultaneously limit the number and size of the parts. Let denote the number of partitions of with at most parts, each of size at most . Equivalently, these are the partitions whose Young diagram fits inside an rectangle. There is a recurrence relation
formula_30
obtained by observing that formula_31 counts the partitions of into exactly parts of size at most , and subtracting 1 from each part of such a partition yields a partition of into at most parts.

The Gaussian binomial coefficient is defined as:
formula_32
The Gaussian binomial coefficient is related to the generating function of by the equality
formula_33

==Rank and Durfee square==

The &quot;rank&quot; of a partition is the largest number &quot;k&quot; such that the partition contains at least &quot;k&quot; parts of size at least &quot;k&quot;. For example, the partition 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 has rank 3 because it contains 3 parts that are ≥ 3, but does not contain 4 parts that are ≥ 4. In the Ferrers diagram or Young diagram of a partition of rank &quot;r&quot;, the &quot;r&quot; × &quot;r&quot; square of entries in the upper-left is known as the Durfee square:

The Durfee square has applications within combinatorics in the proofs of various partition identities. It also has some practical significance in the form of the h-index.

A different statistic is also sometimes called the rank of a partition (or Dyson rank), namely, the difference formula_34 for a partition of &quot;k&quot; parts with largest part formula_35. This statistic (which is unrelated to the one described above) appears in the study of Ramanujan congruences.

==Young&#x27;s lattice==

There is a natural partial order on partitions given by inclusion of Young diagrams. This partially ordered set is known as &quot;Young&#x27;s lattice&quot;. The lattice was originally defined in the context of representation theory, where it is used to describe the irreducible representations of symmetric groups &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; for all &quot;n&quot;, together with their branching properties, in characteristic zero. It also has received significant study for its purely combinatorial properties; notably, it is the motivating example of a differential poset.

== Random partitions ==
There is a deep theory of random partitions chosen according to the uniform probability distribution on the symmetric group via the Robinson–Schensted correspondence. In 1977, Logan and Shepp, as well as Vershik and Kerov, showed that the Young diagram of a typical large partition becomes asymptotically close to the graph of a certain analytic function minimizing a certain functional. In 1988, Baik, Deift and Johansson extended these results to determine the distribution of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation in terms of the Tracy–Widom distribution. Okounkov related these results to the combinatorics of Riemann surfaces and representation theory.

<text>Leeds is a tricounty municipality located in Jefferson, St. Clair, and Shelby counties in the U.S. state of Alabama; it is an eastern suburb of Birmingham. As of the 2020 census, its population was 12,324.

Leeds was founded in 1877, during the final years of the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era. It housed the workers and their families of Lehigh, a Portland cement manufacturing plant.

Leeds is nicknamed &quot;The City of Valor&quot; because of three Congressional Medal of Honor recipients from World War II and the Korean War who called Leeds home: Alford McLaughlin, William Lawley and Henry &quot;Red&quot; Erwin. A wall in the Leeds Historical Society&#x27;s Jonathan Bass House Museum is dedicated to the three men. In spring 2023, Chip Wise, the Leeds High School band director, composed an original piece titled &quot;City of Valor&quot; meant to honor the three Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. In October 2023, the Pearl Harbor National Memorial invited Wise and his marching band to perform the piece at Pearl Harbor on March 26, 2024.
==History==
The War of 1812, geography, geology, and three cultures shaped the history of Leeds. Lying at the crossroads of ancient Native American paths in the center of Alabama, Leeds drew European settlers and their African-American slaves to a land of fertile growing seasons and rich sources of coal and mineral ore. The early settlers built churches and schools with many remaining in Cedar Grove, Oak Ridge, Ohanafeefee, and Mt. Pleasant. The principal survey of Leeds was entered into Jefferson County Map Book 10, page 21, in 1908. The settlement, dating to 1818 and incorporating on April 27, 1887 as &quot;Leeds&quot;, has existed along the banks of the Little Cahaba River; beside an historic stagecoach route; and along two large railroads for the greater part of American history.

James Hamilton, a Scottish-Irish American veteran of the War of 1812 and first sheriff of Shelby County, settled in Cedar Grove in 1816. John Richard Ingram Pashal Stewart, a Cherokee English teacher and American veteran of the War of 1812, settled at Ohanafeefee Village around 1840. At Oak Ridge in 1820 or 1821, European settlers formed Shiloh Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the first CPC congregation in middle Alabama. By 1887, the original railroad pioneers included free African-American settlers who came to work at the Leeds cement plant and the Central of Georgia as the Georgia Pacific railroads. Some gravitated to historic Mt. Pleasant Church, where a handful of freed slaves had founded Scott City; Hillard Holley, Ciscero Davis, Jeff Harris, and Bill Johnson started Leeds Negro/Primary School in 1921.

== Government ==
Leeds, named after Leeds, Yorkshire, England was incorporated on April 27, 1887. The City of Leeds operates under a Mayor-Council form of government. The mayor, elected to a four-year term, heads the executive branch of city government. The current Mayor, David Miller, was elected to his 1st term, in October 2012, by almost a 2:1 margin. The city council members are also elected to four-year terms. Council members are elected to represent the city&#x27;s five districts, and the mayor is elected at-large. The current five-member city council members are Kenneth Washington (District 1), Eric G. Turner (District 2), Johnny G. Dutton (District 3), Angie Latta (District 4) and DeVoris Ragland-Pierce (District 5).

In 2023, Mayor Miller announced a new Downtown Leeds Revitalization Project with Alabama&#x27;s Department of Transportation, ALDOT, which will develop new ADA compliant sidewalks and lighting throughout the city for the enjoyment of residents and tourists. ALDOT and federal funds will pay for 80% of the project, with the City providing the remaining 20%. The project will break ground in 2024.

== Folklore ==
The tale of John Henry was believed to have originated in Leeds. In this folk story, John Henry, the &quot;steel-drivin&#x27; man&quot;, races and wins against a steam engine in the laying of railroad that penetrates the Oak Mountain Tunnel in Leeds. Retired chemistry professor and folklorist John Garst, of the University of Georgia, has argued that the contest happened at the Coosa Mountain Tunnel or the Oak Mountain Tunnel of the Columbus and Western Railway (now part of Norfolk Southern Railway) in Leeds on September 20, 1887.

Based on documentation that corresponds with the account of C.C. Spencer, who claimed in the 1920s to have witnessed the contest, Garst speculates that John Henry may have been a man named Henry who was born a slave to P.A.L. Dabney, the father of the chief engineer of that railroad, in 1850. Since 2007, the city of Leeds has honored John Henry&#x27;s legend during an annual festival held on the third weekend in September, the Leeds Downtown Folk Festival and John Henry Celebration.

==History==
The city of Lipscomb was first incorporated on June 30, 1910, and was named for L. Y. Lipscomb, one of three brothers who first settled in the area in 1885. As early as the 1880s, the community was called Wheeling and the town had 200-300 residents by 1906. The community was originally named after Wheeling, West Virginia because the owners of Woodward Iron Company, who employed many of the residents, also had business interests in that state.

<text>Miguel Ángel Cancel Vázquez (born June 28, 1968) is a Puerto Rican singer, actor and retired police officer who began his career with the Puerto Rico-based boy band Menudo.

==Career==
===Menudo===
Miguel was born in Chicago, Illinois as the only child of Gloria and Felix Cancel. Miguel joined Menudo as a singer in 1981, replacing Óscar Meléndez. He was the first bilingual element on the band, and he was part of the most iconic age of the band called &quot;the golden age&quot; next to Xavier Serbiá, René Farrait, Ricky Meléndez, Johnny Lozada, Charlie Massó and Ray Reyes, collaborating in making Menudo an international sensation, with LP albums like Fuego, Quiero Ser, Por Amor and Una Aventura Llamada Menudo.

He acted in the 2 movies Menudo appeared at, &quot;&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Una Aventura Llamada Menudo&quot; in 1982, and the two mini series &quot;Quiero Ser&quot; and &quot;Es Por Amor&quot; next to Xavier Serbiá, Johnny Lozada, Charlie Massó, Ricky Meléndez and René Farrait, and he also appeared on the TV show, La Gente Joven de Menudo on Telemundo PR as a member of the group.

In 1983, Cancel quit drastically Menudo at the age of 15, a year before the mandatory retirement age of 16, due to his desire to live a &quot;normal life&quot;, even as his voice was already recorded for Menudo&#x27;s next album, &quot;A Todo Rock&quot;. He was replaced by Roy Rosselló.

Cancel sang lead on various Menudo hits, including A Volar, Cuándo Pasará, Por Amor, Xanadú, Quiero Rock, Me Voy A Enamoriscar etc.

Miguel entered at the start of 1981 and left at the end of 1983, an era that was part of what is the golden age of the band and the international &quot;menuditis&quot; era, the band becoming famous on countries like the U.S., Mexico, Peru and others

====El Reencuentro====
In 1998, Cancel was recruited by his ex bandmate Ray Reyes while he worked in the kitchen of a fast food restaurant in the suburbs of Los Angeles to join El Reencuentro, a group consisting of former Menudo members. The band recorded and issued an album of previously released Menudo songs and toured throughout the world in promotion of the album.

====2000s-present====
In 2003, Cancel became a police officer of the Coral Gables, Florida Police Department. In December 2004, he was ejected from the back seat of a Coral Gables police van resulting in the loss of two fingers from his left hand.

Cancel currently lives in Miami, Florida, with his family. He has 4 children Sasha Cancel, Izabella Cancel, Miguel Cancel, Jr. and Mariangelik Cancel. Miguel Cancel Jr. (Miguel Cancel Gulliver) is a swimmer who has won medals in competition at the Florida High School Athletic Association level.

==History==
In 1922, a new high school was named for retired Jefferson County school superintendent, John W. Minor. Thus the community area became known as Minor. The land for the school was donated by the Young family. The location was at the center of the coal communities of Bayview, Brookside, Docena, Edgewater and Mulga and other and later communities (Adamsville, Alden, Coalburg, Crumly Chapel, Forestdale, Fieldstown, Graysville, Hillview, Maytown, McDonald Chapel, Midway, Mineral Springs, Republic, Sandusky and Sylvan Springs). The school burned down in 1926 and rebuilt and reopened in 1928.

W. C. Petty was named principal in 1922 and served through May 1958. The building served as the high school through May 1988 when a new high school was built in Adamsville. In the 1960s, Minor Christian School was established on McDonald Chapel Road.

== Economy ==
Over the years, a few businesses were established:

* Minor Grocery (owner Grace Houk)
* Powell/Motley Grocery
* Top Hat Inn, a night club
* Donaldson Filling Station
* Minor Ice Cream Bar, started by the Blevins family and later operated by Tommy and Jones Pender, the Marshman&#x27;s, the Alexander&#x27;s and Mr. and Mrs. Floyd
* Anthony/Gardner/Lucas Bus Lines
* Lindley Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. (1960 to 2001)
* Stowe Florist
* Reach&#x27;s Hair Salon
* Pit Stop gas station
* Jones Florist
* Rankin&#x27;s TV Repair and Stouts Watch Repair

At the fork of Mulga Loop Road and Docena Road (later changed to Minor Parkway) stood Pete&#x27;s and Bud&#x27;s Bar-B-que and later a Shell service station. Frank Baker built a service station across the road that was demolished to build a highway. Tillman&#x27;s service station was up the road toward Ensley and later became Plunkett&#x27;s Bar-B-Que. Still later, Charlie&#x27;s (a nightclub) was built near Docena Road and Birmingport. A small stripmall was built on Birmingport Road by the Echert&#x27;s. It had a Shell service station, a restaurant and a convenience store. Later, all but the gas station portion burned down.

By 2017, only the Pit Stop was in business.

== Churches ==

* Minor First Baptist
* Minor United Methodist, on land donated by the Young family
* Westmont Baptist
* Minor church of Christ
* Open Door, located on Birmingport Road and later partially operating out of the old Minor Christian School and later the old Methodist Church location

<doc id="104803" wikidata="Q79814" url="?curid=104803" title="Mountain Brook, Alabama">
<text>Mountain Brook is a city in southeastern Jefferson County, Alabama, United States, and a suburb of Birmingham. Its population at the 2020 census was 22,461.

==History==
The city was originally developed in 1929 by real-estate businessman Robert Jemison, Jr., as a whites-only suburb of Birmingham along the ridges known as Red Mountain and Shades Mountain. It was incorporated on May 24, 1942. The plans, by Boston-based landscape architect Warren H. Manning, called for estate-sized lots along winding scenic roads and denser commercial development centering on three picturesque &quot;villages&quot;: English Village, Mountain Brook Village and Crestline Village. Most of Mountain Brook&#x27;s development preserved the existing trees: 92.03% is under tree cover, one of the highest ratios in the nation. Residential sections such as Cherokee Bend, Brookwood Forest, Overton, and Crestline have houses in a forest setting, with a recreational network of bridle paths. This has protected the area from urban encroachment.

Mountain Brook is the location of the first office park in the U.S., built in 1955. It featured the then novel concepts of ample free parking and low-profile office buildings surrounded by waterspouts and landscaped grounds.

A new city hall, including a fire and police station, was completed in 2013.

<text>Pleasant Grove is a city in western Jefferson County, Alabama, United States. It is part of the Birmingham metropolitan area. The population was 9,544 at the 2020 census.

==History==
It was established in 1889 but incorporated as a city on January 16, 1934. The incorporation came about by reason of a rather unusual circumstance. The town sits on land honeycombed by coal mines. For many years, the residents had relied on water wells for their water supply. As years passed and more mining was done, Pleasant Grove found itself confronted with a problem. Residents would sometimes go to their well to draw water only to find there was none. The water had gone into the mines.

During the mid to late 1930s, the Federal Government had a program for financing the building of local water systems. In exploring the possibility of securing such funds, it was revealed that in order to secure such financing a community must be legally incorporated. At this time the incorporation became a reality.

The first appointed Mayor of Pleasant Grove was W.P. Stone. The city is governed by a mayor and five council members who serve four-year terms. Elections for city officials is held during the summer of each leap year with four-year terms beginning the first Monday in October. The area known as Pleasant Grove, Alabama was first homesteaded in September 1836. Pleasant Grove is in Jefferson County. Although no one seems to know when or exactly how the town came by its name, old documents indicate that at least part of this area was called Pleasant Grove as early as 1884. Pleasant Grove was made up of four communities which included Frog Pond, Lizard Ridge, Cottage Hill, and Pleasant Grove.

The city was damaged by large tornadoes in 1956, 1977, 1998, and 2011.

==Government==
The city is governed by a mayor, currently Jerry Brasseale, and five-member council. All city officials are elected to four-year terms on leap years. The council meets the first and third Monday of each month at Pleasant Grove City Hall. Council members as of 2020 include Yolanda Lawson, Philip Houston, Eric Calhoun, Kevin Dunn, and Ray Lassiter.

==Geography==
Pleasant Grove is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Pleasant Grove is home to Milk Creek, so named for its creamy-white color and thick, calcious texture.

==Education==
Pleasant Grove Schools are operated by the Jefferson County Board of Education. Land was originally given to the Board of Education and a gift of $150,000 toward the construction of a Junior High School. In 1970, Pleasant Grove High School was built. It combined with the Junior High School. The schools were accredited by the State of Alabama in May 1973. It agreed to give the Board of Education $1,00 over a ten-year period to add onto the existing Elementary School and get all of the children K-6 under one roof. In January 1997, students who formerly attended Woodward School were relocated to the city.

Construction of a new Pleasant Grove High School was completed in 2010. Pleasant Grove High School has the highest graduation rate in the Jefferson County School system. There are four Nationally Certified teachers on staff, and the remainder of the staff is highly qualified as per Alabama Board of Education standards. The old high school is now the JCIB Middle School.

<doc id="104809" wikidata="Q210347" url="?curid=104809" title="World Organization of the Scout Movement">
<text>The World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM ) is the largest and, after the Order of World Scouts (formed in 1911), is the second-oldest international scout organization, having been established in 1922. It has 176 members. These members are national scout organizations that founded WOSM or have subsequently been recognised by WOSM, which collectively have around 43 million participants. Its operational headquarters is in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia while it is legally based in Geneva, Switzerland.

WOSM&#x27;s current stated mission is &quot;to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Scout Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society&quot;.

WOSM operates through conferences of its member organization representatives, its committee and its full-time bureau, structured into regions. It is associated with three World Scout Centres. A World Scout Jamboree is held approximately every four years under its auspices and it organizes World Scout Moots for 17- to 26-year-olds and previously organized World Scout Indabas, a gathering for Scout leaders. The World Scout Foundation is a separately governed fund, supported by donations, for the development of WOSM associated programs.

WOSM is the counterpart of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). It is a non-governmental organization with General Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

==History==
In 1920, a conference held during the 1st World Scout Jamboree at Olympia, London agreed to create a Boy Scouts international bureau. An office was established at 25 Buckingham Palace Road, London and The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom International Commissioner, Hubert S. Martin, was appointed as honorary director. The bureau&#x27;s principal task was to co-ordinate discussions and prepare a second international conference in Paris in 1922. At the 1922 Paris conference, The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement and its committee were constituted and took over the bureau in London.

In 1961, the organization&#x27;s conference reconstituted the organization under the name World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). Its International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement became WOSM&#x27;s World Scout Conference (&quot;conference&quot;), its Boy Scouts International Committee became WOSM&#x27;s World Scout Committee (&quot;committee&quot;) and its Boy Scouts International Bureau became WOSM&#x27;s World Scout Bureau (&quot;bureau&quot;).

== Member organizations ==

=== Membership policy ===
WOSM&#x27;s membership consists of its remaining founding member organizations and organizations recognized by WOSM as national scout organizations. WOSM&#x27;s rules protect its founding and existing member organizations by permitting only one member organization in each country and locking-out all other Scout organizations from WOSM membership, recognition and participation no matter how worthy or large their membership. Several member organizations are federations, some with different component groups divided on the basis of religion (e.g., France and Denmark), ethnic identification (e.g., Israel) or language (e.g., Belgium). However, WOSM has never required an existing member organization to federate with other Scout organizations in the country, in order to make WOSM more inclusive and representative. There are numerous Canadian Scout organizations but only one is a WOSM member organization (the Canadian branch of one of the organizations that founded WOSM) which has a French language affiliate which is thereby recognized by WOSM. Other than this inherent limitation on WOSM membership, the basis for WOSM membership includes adherence to WOSM&#x27;s aims and principles and independence from political involvement on the part of each member organization.

=== Member organizations in non-sovereign territories ===
WOSM has member organizations in some non-sovereign territories.
*Aruba - Scouting Aruba: full member 
*Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the Caribbean Netherlands (former Netherlands Antilles) - Scouting Antiano: full member 
*Hong Kong - The Scout Association of Hong Kong: full member 
*Macau - Associação de Escoteiros de Macau: full member
*French Polynesia - Conseil du Scoutisme polynésien: associate member 

=== Non-national members ===
WOSM historically recognized some non-national Scout organizations:
* &quot;National&quot; organizations operating outside their original homelands. WOSM&#x27;s conference admitted and recognised the exile Russian Scouts as the &quot;Representatives of Russian Scouting in Foreign Countries&quot; on 30 August 1922 and the Armenian Scouts in France were recognized as a &quot;National Movement on Foreign Soil&quot; on 30 April 1929.
* Small, non-voting associations. The International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone, a group in Panama with Scouts that claimed British and not Panamanian nationality was originally placed under the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Canal Zone Council but, in 1947, was transferred under WOSM&#x27;s bureau. The group had over 900 members in 1957 and existed as a directly registered group until the late 60s. The Boy Scouts of the United Nations began in 1945 and for years there was an active Boy Scouts of the United Nations with several troops at Parkway Village in New York City but only 14 members in 1959. Both the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone and the Boy Scouts of United Nations have long since disbanded.
* Directly registered &quot;mixed-nationality Troops&quot; were registered after discussions concerning such troops took place at WOSM&#x27;s 3rd conference in 1924 at which WOSM&#x27;s bureau was authorized to directly register such groups. It seems that the discussion at WOSM&#x27;s 1924 conference was, at least in part, prompted by a letter to Baden-Powell from the Scoutmaster of one such troop in Yokohama, Japan. Janning&#x27;s troop became the first troop directly registered by WOSM&#x27;s bureau. Only a few troops were directly registered and the practice was soon discontinued with new &quot;mixed&quot; groups being encouraged to join the WOSM member organization of their country of residence. In 1955, only two such groups were still active, a troop in Iraq that disbanded that year, and the first group to be so registered, the International Troop 1 in Yokohama. The only remaining directly registered Troop is the International Boy Scouts, Troop 1 located in Yokohama, Japan.
*Temporary recognition was extended to Scouts in displaced persons camps after World War II. In 1947, at WOSM&#x27;s 11th conference the &quot;Displaced Persons Division&quot; of WOSM&#x27;s bureau was established to register and support Scouts in displaced person camps in Austria, Northern Italy, and Germany. These Scouts did not receive the right of WOSM membership but gained recognition as Scouts under WOSM&#x27;s bureau until they took up residence in a country that had a recognized national Scout organization, which they could join. The D.P. Division was closed on 30 June 1950.

==Structure==

===Conference===
WOSM&#x27;s conference is its general meeting of member organizations&#x27; representatives which meet every three years, hosted by a member association. Each member organizations may send six delegates. The conference is usually preceded by the World Scout Youth Forum.

===Committee===
WOSM&#x27;s committee is its executive governing body, composed of elected volunteers and its secretary general, which is responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of its conference and governs the organization between meetings of its conference. The committee meets at least twice a year. Its steering committee, consisting of the chairperson, two vice-chairpersons and its youth advisor and secretary general meet as needed.

The committee has 21 members. Twelve, each from a different country, are elected for three-year terms by WOSM&#x27;s conference. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, represent the interests of the movement as a whole, not those of their country. The secretary general, the treasurer of WOSM and a representative member of the board of the World Scout Foundation and the chairpersons of the regional Scout committees are &quot;ex-officio&quot; members of the committee. From 2008 to 2021 six Youth Advisors to the WSC were elected by the World Scout Youth Forum. The Youth Advisors participated in all of the WSC meetings and were also part of the governing structure between the meetings. There will be no Youth Advisors from 2024.

The 2021–2024 committee set up work streams to address the top strategic priorities, as defined by WOSM&#x27;s conference, which at present include:
* Educational Methods
** Boosting adult volunteers
** Earth Tribe Coordinating Team
** Gender Mainstreaming Coordination
** Life Skills Initiative
** SCENES Coordination Team
* World Events
** Evolution of its conference
** Innovation of all World Events

** GSAT Review and New Partner On-boarding
** Safe from Harm 1 - Compliance Mechanism Build, Pilot and Implementation
** Safe from Harm in World and Regional Events
** Strengthening Consultants Support in Financial Management

* Volunteer management support
* Monitoring and evaluation support

Standing committees include:
* Audit
* Budget
* Constitutions
* Ethics
* Honours and Awards

====Current committee members====

===Bureau===
WOSM&#x27;s bureau is its secretariat that carries instructions of its conference and committee. The bureau is administered by the secretary general, supported by a staff of technical resource personnel.

A bureau was established in London, England in 1922, moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1959, Geneva, Switzerland after 1 May 1968 and Kuala Lumpur after August 2013.

===Directors/Secretaries General===

===Deputy Secretaries General===


==Kandersteg International Scout Centre==

Kandersteg International Scout Centre in Switzerland, operated by &quot;The KISC Association&quot; is the only WOSM activity centre.

==Programmes==
The &quot;Better World Framework&quot; combines the Scouts of the World Award, Messengers of Peace and World Scout Environment Programmes as programme initiatives administered by WOSM&#x27;s bureau.
==WOSM emblem==

WOSM&#x27;s emblem and trademark is a purple circular logo with a white fleur-de-lis in the center with a purple five-point star in each outer lobe, surrounded by a circle of white rope tied with a reef or square knot at the base.

===Symbolism===

The fleur-de-lis, commonly with a five-point star in each of outer lobe, is a more widely used symbol of the Scout Movement. The fleur-de-lis represents the north point on a map or compass and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service. The three lobes on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: duty to God, service to others and obedience to the Scout Law. A &quot;bond&quot;, tying the three lobes of the fleur-de-lis together, symbolizes the family of Scouts. The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law.

The WOSM emblem adds an encircling rope, tied with a knot at the base, which symbolizes the unity and bond of the Scout Movement and uses purple and white colours. In heraldry, the white of the fleur-de-lis and rope denotes purity and the royal purple denotes leadership and service.

===WOSM emblem history===

For the origin of the fleur-de-lis as a more widely used Scout symbol see: Scout Movement.
From its origin in 1922 until 1939, WOSM did not have its own emblem. In 1939, its director, J. S. Wilson, introduced an international Scout badge, a silver fleur-de-lis on a purple background containing the five continent names in silver framed between two concentric circles. Wearing of the badge was confined to WOSM committee members and bureau staff and their past members. The design became WOSM&#x27;s logo and a purple flag containing the design followed, the flying of which was restricted to WOSM international Scout gatherings.
In 1955, WOSM&#x27;s emblem was redesigned in mid-century minimalist style, dropping the continent names and circles and replacing them with a circle of tied rope in the style of family clan emblems. The redesign was introduced at WOSM&#x27;s 8th World Scout Jamboree by former Boy Scouts of Greece National Commissioner Demetrios Alexatos.

In August 2024, WOSM introduced the current minor redesign of its emblem.

===Use by WOSM member organizations===
WOSM&#x27;s emblem is worn by Scouts and Scouters of several of its member organizations, which determine the manner in which WOSM&#x27;s emblem is worn.

====The Scout Association (United Kingdom)====
The Scout Association refers to WOSM&#x27;s emblem as its &quot;Membership Award&quot; and uses it as its joining badge for its Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Explorer Scouts and Scout Network, with progressing requirements intended to help the member understand their commitment.

====Boy Scouts of America====
The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) refers to WOSM&#x27;s emblem as the World Crest. It may be worn on BSA uniforms as an emblem of the worldwide Scout Movement. BSA first used the badge as an award for Scouts and Scouters who participated in an international Scouting event from early 1956 through 1991 with requirements devised by each council. In 1991, BSA made it part of the uniform for all Scouts and its International Activity Patch replaced the World Scout Crest as an award.

<text>Trussville is a city in Jefferson and St. Clair counties in the State of Alabama. It is a suburb of Birmingham and part of the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Statistical Area. Its population at the 2020 census was 
26,123.

== Geography ==
Trussville is located at (33.621623, -86.596404).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.27%) is water.

==History==

=== Early settlement ===
The first European settler to establish residence in the area was Warren Truss, who entered the area with his brothers and constructed a grist mill on the Cahaba River in 1821. Truss was a North Carolina man of English descent. Trussville remained an agricultural community until after the Civil War, when the Alabama-Chattanooga Railway was built through the city. By 1886 a blast furnace was built on what is now the site of the new Cahaba Elementary School. Trussville was listed as an incorporated community on the 1890 and 1900 U.S. Census rolls. At some point after 1900 until its reincorporation in 1947, it did not appear on census records.

=== Cahaba Project ===

Much of Trussville&#x27;s growth and development came from the Cahaba Project, a planned development of over 250 homes constructed by Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Government Resettlement Administration during the 1930s. The Cahaba Project was originally planned by staff at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute to be a rural community of small farmsteads raising potatoes and vegetables. By the middle of the decade it was decided to locate the community close enough to Birmingham to commute by public transit, so the site in Trussville was chosen. About 60 existing houses were demolished, with white residents moved to the Roper Hill community and cottages for African-Americans built on a 40-acre tract northwest of the Cahaba Project called &quot;Washington Heights&quot; or, more commonly, &quot;The Forties&quot;.

Local landscape architect W. H. Kestler designed a relatively dense suburban layout with 400 houses on 1/2 to 3/4 acre lots encircling a central green space called &quot;The Mall&quot;. The design was approved in 1936 and constructed over the following two years. In all, 243 single-family houses and 44 duplexes were constructed at a total cost of $2,661,981.26. They were rented to approved lower-middle-income families for $14-$23 per month. The village featured paved streets, sidewalks and landscaped park areas. An entrance gateway with a covered gazebo was built at the corner of Main Street and Parkway Drive to serve as the community&#x27;s &quot;front door&quot;.

Most of the one- and two-level homes were constructed in the American four-square style with brick and wood siding, pine floors and metal roofs. Each house had electricity, hot-and-cold running water, and a sewer connection. Two oak saplings were given to each household to beautify their yards. During World War II many families planted Victory Gardens to supplement their grocery rations.

Oak furnishings and appliances were also available to renters at a nominal cost from the government. A back porch was supplied with a hose for a wringer-type washer. A communal washer was also available in a separate building on the mall. Other community facilities included a swimming pool, an elementary school and a high school, all built near the mall. A co-op store was erected near the high school, serving as a general store and lending library. Several churches were founded, including the Holy Infant of Prague Catholic Church.

The Cahaba Association, the Village residents&#x27; organization, elected community leaders, raised funds for civic projects, and published the &quot;Cahaba Hub&quot; newspaper. Many residents participated in an amateur softball league which made use of a lighted field on the mall. Resentment over the privileges given to residents of the government-funded Cahaba Project resulted in tensions between them and the &quot;Old Trussville&quot; families, many of whom lacked electricity and indoor plumbing. The presence of so many community facilities within the project limited interactions between the project&#x27;s residents and their neighbors.

After World War II the government made plans to sell the houses to residents. It also offered undeveloped parcels for sale, giving veterans the first option at 10 percent down. The Cahaba Project was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

=== Incorporation and growth ===
On June 10, 1947, Trussville was incorporated as a town, and on May 31, 1957, the town officially became a city. It was on this date the City of Trussville was adopted as the official name.

Today Trussville is one of the Birmingham region&#x27;s most rapidly growing areas. In the 30-year period between 1980 and 2010, the city grew by over 500%. It has seen much residential and retail construction, with two major shopping centers built during the early 2000s: the Colonial Promenade at Trussville on its western side and both the Colonial Promenade Tutwiler Farm and Pinnacle at Tutwiler Farm along Highway 11 at the I-59/I-459 interchange.

<text>Vestavia Hills, colloquially known simply as Vestavia, is a city in Jefferson and Shelby counties in the U.S. state of Alabama. It is a suburb of Birmingham and it is made up of Vestavia, Liberty Park, and Cahaba Heights. The population was 39,102 at the 2020 census. Vestavia Hills is the third largest city in Jefferson County in 2020, after Birmingham and Hoover. Vestavia Hills is the thirteenth largest city in Alabama.

==History==

Vestavia Hills is named for the estate of former Birmingham mayor George B. Ward. It was situated on the crest of Shades Mountain in what is now the northern edge of the city. Ward&#x27;s mansion at the Vestavia estate became a landmark in the area as soon as it was completed in 1925. The -story house was patterned after the circular Temple of Vesta in Rome, with dark pink sandstone walls encircled by 20 massive white Doric columns surmounted by a carved entablature. The extensive gardens, populated by statuary and peacocks, surrounded a smaller domed gazebo patterned after the Temple of Sibyl in Tivoli.

After Ward&#x27;s death, the house, something of a tourist stop near the highway between Birmingham and Montgomery, was used as a tearoom and reception hall before being purchased by Vestavia Hills Baptist Church. The church met in the temple like structure for several years before demolishing a portion of the building in 1971 to make way for a larger building; a central portion of the original building remains. The local garden club moved the gazebo to a prominent outcropping closer to the highway, there to serve as a landmark gateway into the community.

The development of Vestavia Hills as a residential suburb began in 1946, when developer Charles Byrd planned a subdivision for approximately 1,000 people on the southern flank of Shades Mountain. The suburb was incorporated as a separate city on November 8, 1950, and has since grown, by rapid development and annexation, into a thriving small city of over 39,000 by 2020.

<text>Sulligent is a city in Lamar County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 1,927, down from its record high of 2,151 in 2000. From 1910-1950 and again in 2000, it was the largest community in Lamar County before losing the distinction both times to the county seat of Vernon. The name is derived from railroad personnel.

== History ==
Sulligent was first called Elliott, in honor of the chief engineer of the Kansas City-Memphis-Birmingham Railroad, then renamed one month later with the portmanteau &quot;Sulligent&quot;, in honor of Sullivan, the superintendent of the railroad, and Sargeant, the passenger agent of the railroad. The town was incorporated on February 12, 1897. S. F. Pennington owned the first general store and Dr. R. J. Redden owned the first drug store.

The production and processing of cotton was an important industry. The primary business in Sulligent in the mid-1890s was cotton, with over 2500 bales ginned each year and shipped via the railroad. At one time, Sulligent Cotton Oil Company was known as the largest cotton gin under one roof.

Sulligent is home to Lamar County&#x27;s only structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Greer Bankhead House, which antedates the city by almost four decades.

In 2023, Mayor Scott Boman and the City Council elected to demolish the historical site of The Ogden House instead of restoring the structure. The Ogden House was the first home built inside of the incorporated city of Sulligent. The house had stood since 1888 and had served as the home of William W. and Tallulah Henson Ogden. William W. Ogden was the owner of the Sulligent Cotton Oil Company, a planter, banker, mayor of Sulligent 1919-1921, and member of the Alabama House of Representatives 1931-1934. Leila Ogden, daughter of the builder presented this house to the Town of Sulligent in 1975 where it acted as the public library until the late 1990s when the current public library was built.

==Notable people==

Sulligent was the home to Rashad Johnson, a University of Alabama All-SEC and All-American safety, who was selected in the 2009 NFL draft. Sulligent is the home of former Major League Baseball player (from 1948 to 1951) Bubba Harris and former Negro league baseball player (from 1931 to 1951) Sam Bankhead. Sulligent was the childhood home of John H. Bankhead, a Confederate officer during the American Civil War and a Democratic U.S. Senator from 1907 until his death in 1920.

== History ==
The city of Vernon was originally known as Swayne Courthouse; it was named for the head of the Freedman&#x27;s Bureau, General Wager Swayne, who served in the Chattahoochee District of the state. Many of the records of this time were lost, when the courthouse burned in 1866. The name of the town was changed in 1868 to Vernon after Edmund Vernon.

Both before and after the Civil war, the economy of Vernon was based on timber, agriculture, and milling. After the Civil War, the plantations were sold off to timber interests, which eliminated many jobs. Since the end of Reconstruction, Vernon has experienced waves of manufacturing with textile factories being introduced in the early 20th century. All of these textile factories no longer exist. Some manufacturers remain, such as Marathon, an international manufacturer of trash compactors.

<doc id="104829" wikidata="Q79743" url="?curid=104829" title="Florence, Alabama">
<text>Florence is a city in, and the county seat of, Lauderdale County, Alabama, United States, in the state&#x27;s northwestern corner, and had a population of 40,184 in the 2020 census. Florence is located along the Tennessee River and is home to the University of North Alabama, the oldest public college in the state. Florence is located about 70 miles west of Huntsville, Alabama, via US-72, and about 115 miles northwest of Birmingham, Alabama.

Florence is the largest and principal city of the &quot;Quad Cities,&quot; more commonly known as &quot;The Shoals,&quot; which also includes the cities of Muscle Shoals, Sheffield, and Tuscumbia in Colbert County and had a population of 148,779 as of the 2020 census. Florence is considered northwestern Alabama&#x27;s primary economic hub.

Annual tourism events include the W. C. Handy Music Festival in the summer and the Renaissance Faire in the fall. Landmarks in Florence include the 20th-century Rosenbaum House, the only Frank Lloyd Wright-designed home located in Alabama. The Florence Indian Mound, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was constructed by indigenous people between 400 BCE and 100 BCE in the Woodland period and is the largest surviving earthen mound in the state.

==Geography==
Florence is located at (34.8303495, -87.6654194).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and (0.40%) is water.

Florence is located on Wilson Lake and Pickwick Lake, bodies of water on the Tennessee River dammed by Pickwick Dam and Wilson Dams. Pickwick Lake was created by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), an agency established under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. It was a public works program intended to build dams and hydroelectric power and related infrastructure to generate electricity for the rural region to stimulate economic development, provide flood control, and recreational opportunities. Wilson Dam (now operated by the TVA) was authorized by President Woodrow Wilson in 1918 and was the first dam constructed on the Tennessee River.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Florence has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

The average temperature of Florence is . The average yearly precipitation in Florence is . On average, Florence gets of snow per year, which is above the average for Alabama of .

While Florence is almost from the Gulf of Mexico, strong hurricanes have brought severe weather to the area. For example, in 2005, the path of Hurricane Katrina came very close to the city, causing nearly winds and some storm damage.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Evidence for human habitation in the Florence area goes back to at least 500 BCE, when the Florence Indian Mound, the largest of its type in the Tennessee Valley, was constructed as an earthwork during the Woodland period. Successive cultures arose after this. In the historic period, the area of present-day Florence was occupied by the Chickasaw Nation. They first encountered white traders and settlers beginning in the late 1700s, and were forced to cede their land to the Federal government through a series of treaties in early 1800s, as part of the Indian Removal policy to extinguish tribal land claims east of the Mississippi River. The Chickasaw were removed to west of the river in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).

General John Coffee, John McKinley, a future U.S. Supreme Court Justice, and five other trustees established the Cypress Land Company to found a town on a hill overlooking the Tennessee River. The company bought the land, believing that Florence&#x27;s location along Jackson&#x27;s Military Road and at the end of the treacherous Muscle Shoals rapids on the Tennessee River would enable it to develop as a major commercial center. In 1819, Coffee commissioned Ferdinand Sannoner, a young Italian engineer, to survey and plan the town. Situating the town on the plateau overlooking the Tennessee River provided protection from flooding as well as the disease of the swampier lowlands by the riverbank. The investors were so pleased with Sannoner&#x27;s work that he was allowed to choose the name of the new settlement; he named it after Florence, the capital of the Tuscany region of Italy.

===Antebellum Florence (1826–1860)===
The first river steamboat visited the town in 1821. Speculators and settlers, including General Andrew Jackson and President James Monroe, bought up plots of land as they were sold by the Cypress Land Co. Florence quickly became an important commercial hub on the Tennessee River, but it did not reach the level its founders had hoped. However, Florence did grow quickly enough to be incorporated by the State Legislature in 1826. By 1831, the increased cotton cultivation in the area to the east of Florence necessitated the expansion and improvement of transport facilities in the area, including the digging of a canal around the Muscle Shoals. Congress appropriated land for that purpose and construction began in 1831, with the Muscle Shoals Canal opening in 1837, however, the locks could not support steamships and the state had difficulty maintaining the construction, so it was abandoned shortly thereafter. Equally important was the construction of a railroad bridge across the Tennessee River, with the first bridge being completed in the 1830s, but would be washed away by a flood soon after completion. Another bridge would be completed in 1840 and would last until the mid-1850s, when it was damaged by tornadoes in 1850 and 1854, resulting in its decommissioning. The rock piers of the 1840 bridge survived the damage and form the foundation of the present structure. As a part of Florence&#x27;s development as a commercial hub, a variety of manufacturing enterprises sprung up around the city, including an iron foundry, lumber, cotton, and wool mills, as well as a complex of cotton, flour, and corn mills along Cypress Creek known as the Globe Factory.

Plantations, too, sprung up around Florence, driven by cheap fertile land and high cotton prices. Two of these plantation homes are of note: Sweetwater Mansion and the Forks of Cypress. Sweetwater Mansion is notable for being the residence of Robert M. Patton, the first governor of Alabama after the Civil War and for the various paranormal sightings that have occurred there. The Forks of Cypress, on the other hand, was the plantation home of James Jackson, one of the original Cypress Land Co. trustees, and was acclaimed for its architectural style and the quality of its racing horses. With the plantation economy, so too came slavery. While slavery in northwest Alabama did not reach the magnitude that it did in the Black Belt, a significant percentage of the population (about 14% in 1818) was enslaved and by 1860, there were twenty three plantations in Lauderdale County that had over fifty slaves. Not all slaves worked on the plantation, however, many worked in construction or in other contexts. Dred Scott was brought to Florence in the 1820s and served as a hosteler in the local inn, before his participation in the landmark Supreme Court case.
As a sign of progress and ambition, townspeople established the Florence Female Academy here in 1847, for paying female students. By the 1850s, the school was converted into the Florence Synodical Female College, affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. It closed in 1893. A historical marker commemorates the site. LaGrange College, Alabama&#x27;s first chartered college, was established near Leighton in 1830 before being moved across the river to Florence in 1855. The move to Florence was controversial, however, and the Florence site was denied the use of the LaGrange name and was thus chartered as Florence Wesleyan University in 1856, with its main building being Wesleyan Hall. One hundred and 60 students enrolled in the first year of operation (1855) of Florence Wesleyan University and quickly attracted students from five states and two foreign countries. The university also chartered a grammar school, which still serves today as Kilby Laboratory School, the only university-operated elementary school in Alabama. After becoming publicly owned during the Postbellum period, the university went through a variety of name changes, including: Florence Normal School, Florence State Teachers College, and Florence State University, before changing its name to the University of North Alabama in 1972.

===Civil War through the turn of the century (1861–1900)===

===The 20th-century===
The Burrell Normal School was open from 1903 until 1969, and served as a private segregated school for African American students in Florence, serving grades 1-12 and a normal school.

It is thought to be a locale for tribal ceremony and ritual. Formerly two smaller mounds and an earthen wall were associated with the complex. The Indian Mound Museum displays Native American artifacts from the Mound and the surrounding area, which represent different indigenous cultures dating back 1,000 years. In 2017 a new, expanded museum was built to replace one built in 1968 and display artifacts and interpret the ancient and historic cultures of the indigenous peoples of the area.

==Transportation==

Florence is the merger point for two major U.S. Highways, as well as several Alabama Highways. Both U.S. Highway 43 and U.S. Highway 72 merge just east of the city limits in Killen, and are co-signed their entire length through the city. Highway 43, running north and south, helps connect the city to Lawrenceburg and Columbia to the north in Tennessee, as well as Tuscaloosa and Mobile to the south. Highway 72 helps connect the city to Huntsville and Chattanooga, Tennessee to the east and Memphis, Tennessee to the west. Interstate 65 is accessible about forty-five minutes east on Highway 72. Both of these roads cross the Tennessee River on O&#x27;Neal Bridge, connecting Florence to Sheffield.

Alabama state highways that serve the city include State Route 13, State Route 17, State Route 20, State Route 133, and State Route 157. Alabama 133 connected Florence and Muscle Shoals via Wilson Dam until 2002, when the new six-lane &quot;Patton Island Bridge&quot; finished construction. The bridge is part of a new corridor that eventually saw the widening of Wilson Dam Road in Muscle Shoals to Alabama 20 (Phase 1 widening to six lanes to Avalon Avenue, Phase 2 widening to 4 lanes to Alabama 157/72 alt), and the construction of a new road from the bridge to Florence Blvd, eventually becoming part of Helton, Dr. in Florence. State Route 157, a road to Florence and the Shoals area, serves as a four-lane link to Interstate 65 in Cullman. The project was completed in the summer of 2007. The road is known as the &quot;University of North Alabama Highway&quot;.

Florence and the Shoals area does not have a direct link to an Interstate highway. One solution discussed has been the Memphis to Atlanta Highway, proposed to connect the two cities via a freeway through north Alabama. However, in recent years Mississippi has concentrated its funding on U.S. 78 (Interstate 22), also known as &quot;Corridor X&quot;. Though U.S. 72 through Mississippi is four lanes, there are no plans to upgrade it to freeway status. The state of Georgia has also not committed to the necessary work to connect the freeway from the Alabama state line to Atlanta. The highway remains in the planning stages with the Alabama Department of Transportation.

Another plan recently discussed is extending Interstate 565 west from its current terminus just outside Decatur, along Alabama 20/Alternate U.S. 72. The plan has received support from Decatur officials. 

There is no fixed-route transit service in Florence. However, the Northwest Alabama Council of Local Governments operates a dial-a-ride transit service known as NACOLG Transit.

Florence is served by the Northwest Alabama Regional Airport in Muscle Shoals. The airport is used for commercial and general aviation, It is served commercially by Contour Airlines which provides several daily flights to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, giving the city access to hundreds of domestic and international destinations. Huntsville International Airport, another option for Florence residents, offers service to eleven domestic destinations, and is an hour&#x27;s drive from Florence.

Local industry is served by the Tennessee Southern Railroad (TSRR), which runs from Florence to Columbia, Tennessee, and the Port of Florence on Pickwick Lake.

<text>Rogersville is a town in Lauderdale County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2018 census, the population of the town is 1,231, up from 1,199 in 2000.

==History==
The town became an incorporated municipality on February 2, 1858. Originally known as &quot;Rodgersville&quot;, it took its name from Andrew and Patience Rodgers of South Carolina who moved into the area and purchased at a public land sale in Huntsville on May 3, 1818. Their land eventually became what is now the downtown business district. When the Rogersville Post Office was established on October 4, 1825, with Thomas Cunningham as the postmaster, the &#x27;d&#x27; was dropped from the town&#x27;s name and it has been known as Rogersville ever since.

The town became a popular trading center due in part to its location near the intersection of three early thoroughfares, U.S. 72, Snake Road and Lamb&#x27;s Ferry Road. U.S. 72, which now connects Chattanooga and Memphis, Tennessee, was once part of an Indian trail from Ditto&#x27;s Landing on the Tennessee River south of Huntsville and was used to bypass the Muscle Shoals river barrier. Snake Road leads out of Rogersville into neighboring Limestone County and provided passage from Florence to Athens by way of a shallow ford across Elk River. Lamb&#x27;s Ferry Road was named for John Lamb who moved from Indian Creek in Giles County, Tennessee in 1816 to establish a ferry across the Tennessee River south of what would later become Rogersville. Lamb&#x27;s Ferry became an important river port where boats from Knoxville and other points on the upper Tennessee River would unload supplies that were taken over land to areas around Pulaski, TN.

<doc id="104836" wikidata="Q52931" url="?curid=104836" title="Adolf Frederick of Sweden">
<text>Adolf (or Adolph) Frederick (; ; 14 May 171012 February 1771) was King of Sweden from 1751 until his death in 1771. He was the son of Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin, and Albertina Frederica of Baden-Durlach. He was an uncle of Catherine the Great and husband to Louisa Ulrika of Prussia.

The first king from the House of Holstein-Gottorp, Adolf Frederick was a weak monarch, installed as first in line to the throne following the parliamentary government&#x27;s failure to reconquer the Baltic provinces in 1741–1743. Aside from a few attempts, supported by pro-absolutist factions among the nobility, to reclaim the absolute monarchy held by previous monarchs, he remained a mere constitutional figurehead until his death.

His reign saw an extended period of internal peace. However, the finances stagnated following failed mercantilist doctrines pursued by the Hat administration. The Hat administration ended during the 1765–1766 parliament, where the Cap opposition took over the government and enacted reforms towards greater economic liberalism, as well as a Freedom of Press Act. The Freedom of Press Act is unique for the time for its curtailing of all censorship, retaining punitive measures only for libeling the monarch or the Church of Sweden.

==Ancestry==
Adolf Frederick&#x27;s father was Christian Augustus (1673–1726) duke and a younger prince of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, prince-bishop of Lübeck, and administrator, during the Great Northern War, of the duchies of Holstein-Gottorp for his relative Charles Frederick.

His mother, Albertina Frederica of Baden-Durlach (1682–1755), was a descendant of earlier royal dynasties of Sweden, great-granddaughter of Princess Catherine of Sweden, mother of King Charles X of Sweden. On his mother&#x27;s side, Adolf Frederick was descended from King Gustav Vasa and Christina Magdalena, a sister of Charles X of Sweden.

==Reign==
From 1727 to 1750 Prince Adolf Frederick was the prince-bishop of Lübeck. This meant he ruled a fief around and including Eutin. After his first cousin, Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, died in 1739, Adolf Frederick became the administrator of Holstein-Kiel during the minority of the duke&#x27;s orphan son, Charles Peter Ulrich. Shortly afterward, the young boy was invited to Russia by his maternal aunt, Empress Elizabeth, who soon declared him her heir. He later became known as Peter III of Russia.

In 1743, Adolf Frederick was elected heir to the throne of Sweden by the Hat faction (Swedish: &quot;Hattarna&quot;). The Hat faction wanted to obtain better conditions at the Treaty of Åbo from Empress Elizabeth. He succeeded to the Swedish throne on 25 March 1751.

During his 20-year reign, Adolf Frederick was little more than a figurehead, the real power being with the Riksdag of the Estates, often distracted by party strife. Twice he endeavored to free himself from the tutelage of the estates. The first occasion was in 1756. Stimulated by his consort Louisa Ulrika of Prussia (sister of Frederick the Great), he tried to regain a portion of the attenuated prerogative through the Coup of 1756 to abolish the rule of the Riksdag of the Estates and reinstate absolute monarchy in Sweden. He nearly lost his throne in consequence. On the second occasion during the December Crisis of 1768, under the guidance of his eldest son, Gustav, he succeeded in overthrowing the &quot;Cap&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Mössorna&quot;) senate, but was unable to make any use of his victory.

==Death==
Adolf Frederick died suddenly in Stockholm on 12 February 1771 with symptoms resembling either heart failure or poisoning. Popular stories about his death having resulted from a large meal (consisting of lobster, caviar, sauerkraut, kippers, and champagne as well as 14 helpings of his favourite dessert of semla pastries and hot milk) are considered propaganda by modern writers.

Following his death, his son Gustav III seized power in 1772 in a military coup d&#x27;état, reinstating absolute rule.

==Legacy==
The King was regarded as dependent on others, a weak ruler, and lacking of any talents as a statesman. However, he was allegedly a good husband, a caring father, and a gentle master to his servants. He was scientifically talented and especially interested in astronomy. He also had talent in military matters and in music. His favourite pastime was woodworking, especially to make snuffboxes, which he reportedly spent a great deal of time doing. His hospitality and friendliness were witnessed by many who deeply mourned him at his death.

==Children==

By his marriage to Princess Louisa Ulrika of Prussia (which took place on 18 August/29 August 1744 in Drottningholm), he had five children:

# (Stillborn) (18 February 1745 in Stockholm)
# Gustav III (1746–1792)
# Charles XIII (1748–1818)
# Frederick Adolf (1750–1803)
# Sofia Albertina (1753–1829)

With Jeanne Du Londel he had one son:

# Adolf Fredriksson (c. 1734-1771), Captain in the Swedish Army.

With Marguerite Morel he had one son who died as a child: 
# Frederici (c. 1761 - 1771)

Adolf Frederick may have been the father of Lolotte Forssberg by Ulla von Liewen, but this has never been confirmed.

<doc id="104839" wikidata="Q67892" url="?curid=104839" title="Courtland, Alabama">
<text>Courtland is a town in Lawrence County, Alabama, United States, and is included in the Decatur Metropolitan Area, as well as the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. The population was 609 at the 2010 census, down from 769 in 2000.

==History==

A small creek named Big Nance Creek runs through the town. The creek was named for a Cherokee chief who lived in the area when the first European settlers arrived. The current town is reportedly located on the site of the Native American village.

Courtland began as a small settlement known as Ebenezer in the early 1800s. Its early settlers were wealthy planters mostly from Virginia, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Georgia. It was presently named for the federal courthouse and land office there. In 1818, a group known as the Courtland Land Company bought the land on which the town is now situated and subdivided it into lots. The town was incorporated on December 13, 1819, by the Alabama territorial legislature

The early roads Gaines Trace and Byler Road went through town.

One of the South&#x27;s earliest railroads, the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad, was organized at Courtland in 1831, and chartered the following year. The railroad&#x27;s organizers routed the railroad to bypass the dangerous shoals along the Tennessee River to the north. The railroad was absorbed by the Memphis and Charleston Railroad in the 1850s, and later became part of the Southern Railway.

In 1835, Courtland physician Jack Shackelford organized a volunteer military unit to fight in the Texas Revolution. Known as the &quot;Red Rovers&quot; for the color of their uniforms, the company was captured by Mexican forces at Coleto in March 1836, and most of its men were killed in the Goliad massacre. Shackelford was among the few survivors.

In 1944 and 1945, during World War II, Courtland was home to the Courtland Army Airfield (Courtland AAF). It was dismantled after the war and given to the city of Courtland, which now operates it as Courtland Airport.

===Courtland Historic District===
In the early 1990s, more than 100 buildings in Courtland were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Courtland Historic District. Most of the buildings in the district date from the 1830s through the 1930s, and architectural styles include Federal, Italianate, Victorian, Colonial Revival, and Neoclassical. The Town Square was part of the town&#x27;s original 1818-1819 plan. Many of the commercial buildings facing the square, especially along College Street and Tennessee Street, were built in the 1890s and early 1900s. The train depot on the south side of the square, now a community center, was built in the late 1880s. The Old Sherrod Hotel, located at the northwest corner of Tennessee Street and Alabama Street, was built around 1930, and provided housing for early Tennessee Valley Authority employees.

The John McMahon House, a Federal-style home built around 1830, is listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places. Rocky Hill Castle was a forced-labor plantation whose architecturally renowned plantation house was demolished in 1961.

<text>Auburn is a city in Lee County, Alabama, United States. It is the largest city in eastern Alabama. The population was 76,143 at the 2020 census. It is a principal city of the Auburn-Opelika Metropolitan Area. The Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA with a 2020 population of 193,773, along with the Columbus, GA-AL MSA and Tuskegee, Alabama, comprises the greater Columbus-Auburn-Opelika, GA-AL CSA, a region home to 563,967 residents as of 2020.

Auburn is a historic college town and is the home of Auburn University. It is Alabama&#x27;s fastest-growing metropolitan area and the 19th-fastest-growing metro area in the United States as measured since 1990. U.S. News ranked Auburn among its top ten list of best places to live in the United States for the year 2009. The city&#x27;s unofficial nickname is &quot;The Loveliest Village on the Plains&quot;, taken from a line in the poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith: &quot;Sweet Auburn! Loveliest village of the plain...&quot;

==History==

Inhabited in antiquity by the Creek, the land on which Auburn sits was opened to settlement in 1832 with the Treaty of Cusseta. The first settlers arrived in the winter of 1836 from Harris County, Georgia. These settlers, led by Judge John J. Harper, intended to build a town that would be the religious and educational center for the area.

Auburn was incorporated on February 2, 1839, in what was then Macon County, covering an area of . By that time, Methodist and Baptist churches had been established, and a school had been built and had come into operation. In the mid-1840s, separate academies for boys and girls were established in addition to the primary school. This concentration of educational institutions led to a rapid influx of families from the planter class into Auburn in the 1840s and 1850s. By 1858, of the roughly 1,000 free residents of Auburn, some 500 were students.

In 1856, the state legislature chartered a Methodist college, the East Alabama Male College in Auburn. This college, now Auburn University, opened its doors in 1859, offering a classical and liberal education.

With the advent of the Civil War in 1861, Auburn quickly emptied. All of the schools closed, and most businesses shuttered. Auburn was the site of a hospital for Texan Confederate soldiers, but only saw direct combat with the raids of Rousseau in 1864 and Wilson in 1865.

After the Civil War, Auburn&#x27;s economy entered a prolonged depression that would last the remainder of the century. Public schools did not reopen until the mid-1870s, and most businesses remained closed. A series of fires in the 1860s and 1870s gutted the downtown area. East Alabama Male College was turned over to the state in 1872, and with funds from the federal Morrill Act was renamed Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College with a new mission as a land grant college. Passage of the Hatch Act in 1887 allowed for expansion of agricultural research facilities on campus.

In 1892, the college became the first four-year college in Alabama to admit women. This, combined with increased interest in scientific agriculture and engineering and new funding from business licenses, allowed the city to start expanding again. By 1910, Auburn&#x27;s population had returned to its antebellum level. SIAA Conference championships won by the Auburn college&#x27;s football team brought attention and support to Auburn, and helped fill the city&#x27;s coffers.

Fortunes were quickly reversed with the collapse of cotton prices in the early 1920s and the subsequent Great Depression a decade later. Due to these events, the state government became unable to fund the college, and—as Auburn&#x27;s economy was completely derived from the college—residents were forced into a barter economy to support themselves.

Money began to flow into Auburn again with America&#x27;s entry into World War II. Auburn&#x27;s campus was turned into a training ground for technical specialists in the armed forces. After the war, Auburn was flooded by soldiers returning to school on the G.I. Bill.

Primarily due to this influx of students, Auburn began a period of growth that lasted through the 1950s and 1960s. A considerable amount of residential and business construction pushed Auburn&#x27;s growth outside of the original boundaries of the city, leading to a series of large annexations which expanded Auburn to nearly . Construction of Interstate 85 beginning in 1957 connected Auburn to the major cities of the state. This allowed for Auburn University (renamed in 1960) to schedule more home football games in Auburn rather than in larger cities, creating a strong tourism component in Auburn&#x27;s economy. Auburn Mall opened as &quot;Village Mall&quot; in 1973.

Growth slowed somewhat in the 1970s, and a series of budget cuts made it clear that Auburn&#x27;s sole economic reliance on Auburn University put the city in a tenuous position.

Backlash against what was seen as an ineffectual city council led to the election of Jan Dempsey as mayor in 1980 and the removal of the previous city government system in favor of a council-manager system. With a new government in place, the city began aggressively pursuing industry, leading to a nearly 1,200% increase in the number of industrial jobs over the next twenty years. As public satisfaction with the city administration reached record levels, Auburn began very rapid residential growth.

A series of reports in the 1980s and 1990s ranking the Auburn public school system among the top in the state and nation convinced thousands of new residents to move to Auburn over the past 25 years. Between 1980 and 2003, Auburn&#x27;s population grew by 65%, and Auburn&#x27;s economy expanded by 220%.

The population growth has only accelerated into the 21st century, both organically within the city and through annexation and incorporation of surrounding portions of Lee County. Auburn&#x27;s population has grown over 77% from 2000 to the latest 2020 decennial census figures. With the continued rapid growth comes issues of urban sprawl and expansions to infrastructure, which have become two of Auburn&#x27;s primary political issues.

==Geography==
The city of Auburn lies in western Lee County and is bordered by the city of Opelika to the northeast and by Chambers County to the north. The city stretches south to the Macon County line in the southwest.

Auburn sits on the Fall Line at the juncture of the piedmont plateau and the coastal plain. Portions of Auburn also include the southernmost exposure of rocks indicating the Appalachian orogeny—as such, the last foothill of the Appalachian Mountains lies in Chewacla State Park in southern Auburn. As a result of these three varied physical environments, Auburn has an extremely diverse geology.

The southwest and west regions of the city on the plateau are marked by rolling plains and savannahs, with the undeveloped portion primarily being used for cattle grazing and ranching. South of this region sits the coastal plain, with sandy soil and pine forest. Parts of north Auburn have much more rugged topographies, with thick forests in high hills and deep hollows of the type common to parts of eastern Tennessee. The region surrounded by Chewacla Park in the south of the city contains sharp peaks and sudden drops of elevation as the 1.05 billion-year-old rock of the Appalachians meets the coastal plain.

Auburn sits near the divide between the Chattahoochee and Tallapoosa River watersheds, though the vast majority of the city resides in the latter. Auburn is drained by three main creek systems: in the south, by the Chewacla/Opintlocco Creek system; in the north, by the Saugahatchee Creek system; and in the extreme northern reaches of Auburn by Sandy Creek. The dividing line between the Chewacla and Saugahatchee watersheds roughly follows railroad line east–west through the center of town.

Auburn is located at (32.597684, −85.480823) and according to the United States Census Bureau in 2000, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (1.11%) is water. The elevation of Auburn at City Hall is above sea level; though due to Auburn&#x27;s diverse topography, elevation ranges from above sea level where Chewacla Creek crosses Sand Hill Road to above sea level in northern Auburn near the Chambers County line.

Typical of the Deep South, Auburn has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), marked by mild winters, early springs, long, hot, muggy summers, and warm autumns. Due to its position near the Gulf of Mexico, the city receives a significant amount of rainfall—on average, per year—though there is a distinct dry season in the late summer and early fall. Severe storm activity – thunderstorms producing damaging winds or large hail – is common from the late winter through early summer. There is the risk of tornadoes. Owing to its proximity to the Gulf, Auburn is also subject to fringe effects from tropical storms and hurricanes in the summer and fall. Hurricanes Opal in 1995 and Ivan in 2004 are among two of the most notable tropical systems to affect the Auburn area in recent memory, bringing torrential rains and high winds.

Winters are typically mild, with an average of snowfall, though more than three-fourths of all seasons do not have any measurable snow. Most days have + highs, and from December to February, an average total of 10–11 days of + highs, while it rarely stays below freezing all day. However, the city straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 7B and 8A, and there are an average of 5.6 nights with sub- lows. On the other end, summers are long, hot, and humid, with 57 days of + highs. Although the actual air temperature reaching is uncommon (1.2 days annually), high humidity can push daytime heat indices over that mark.

The record high for Auburn is , set on July 15, 1980 (needs updating), and August 10, 1980, while the record low was , set on February 13, 1899, and January 21, 1985.

==Auburn Precinct/Division (1870–1970)==

The Auburn Beat (Lee County 2nd Beat) first appeared on the 1870 U.S. Census. In 1890, &quot;beat&quot; was changed to &quot;precinct&quot;. In 1870, 1930 and 1940 when racial demographics were reported, it showed a Black majority. In 1960, the precinct was changed to &quot;census division&quot; as part of a general reorganization of counties. The city boundaries and that of the census division were contiguous by that census. In 1980, the census divisions of Auburn and Opelika, along with parts of Loachapoka-Roxana, Opelika Rural-Pepperell were consolidated into the new division of Auburn-Opelika.

==Auburn-Opelika Census Division (1980–)==

The Auburn-Opelika Census Division was created in 1980 by the merger of Auburn and Opelika census divisions and parts of Loachapoka-Roxana, Opelika Rural-Pepperell divisions.

==Law and government==
Auburn has a council-manager government led by an eight-member city council, a mayor, and an appointed city manager.

The city council acts as a legislative body of the city, passing laws and regulations and appointing citizens to the city&#x27;s various boards, including the Auburn City Board of Education. Each member of the city council is elected for a four-year term from one of eight geographic wards.

Members of the current Auburn City Council are:

The mayor of Auburn is elected in the city at-large to a four-year term. The duties of the mayor are, per State Code: 1) ceremonial, 2) to serve as the Governor&#x27;s contact in the event of an emergency and 3) to conduct Council meetings, and to be the tie breaking vote for the city council legislative body. The Mayor has no administrative duties, as the City Manager serves as the CEO. As such, the position of mayor in Auburn is primarily symbolic. The current mayor of Auburn is Ron Anders, elected in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.

The day-to-day operations of Auburn are run by the City Manager. The City Manager is appointed by and serves at the leisure of the City Council.

The Auburn City Schools public school system is currently served by one high school for the entire city, a 350,000 square-foot, $72 million facility that opened in 2017 and houses students in 10th through 12th grade. As of the 2021–22 school year, the student population at Auburn High is the most of any high school in the state of Alabama. After the completion of the new high school facility, the old Auburn High School site was converted into a Junior High School, serving students in 8th and 9th grade. The old Auburn Junior High School became East Samford School, a 7th grade academy, while Drake Middle School hosts all 6th graders in the city school system. Elementary school zones are in pairs throughout the city; one school in the zone houses kindergarten through 2nd grade, while the other school serves grades 3 through 5.

Auburn University football in particular is a major force in Auburn&#x27;s culture and economy. When Auburn University has home football games in the fall, the city often sees over 100,000 visitors, and the yearly economic impact is measured at nearly $100 million. While other sports do not attract as many tourists to Auburn, the university&#x27;s 17 varsity sports offer citizens a variety of other opportunities for viewing competition at virtually the highest level.

Home football games particularly change the face of Auburn for several weekends a year. Tens of thousands of fans flood the campus hours—sometimes days—before the game to tailgate, creating a festival-like atmosphere throughout the weekend. Football games in Auburn are played in 87,451 seat Jordan–Hare Stadium, which sits on the main campus, just a few blocks from downtown.

Basketball is played at 9,600-seat Neville Arena, while baseball games are held at 4,096-seat Plainsman Park, which was named the top collegiate ballpark in the nation by &quot;Baseball America&quot; in 2003. One of Auburn&#x27;s most competitive sports is the swimming program, which has won seven of the last nine NCAA national championships including the last five straight and 11 consecutive SEC men&#x27;s championships. Also, the women&#x27;s program have won five NCAA national titles and four SEC championships. The teams compete at the James E. Martin Aquatics Center. More Olympic swimmers have come from Auburn&#x27;s swimming program than any other university swimming program.

<text>Loachapoka ( ) is a town in Lee County, Alabama, United States. It is located less than 1/2 mile west of Auburn and approximately west of Auburn University, in west-central Lee County. The population was 180 as of the 2010 Census. It is part of the Auburn metropolitan area.

The name &quot;Loachapoka&quot; means &quot;turtle killing place&quot; in Muskogee, with &quot;locha&quot; meaning &quot;turtle&quot; and &quot;poga&quot; meaning &quot;killing place&quot;. In literature, Lochapoka was the destination of the colonists in James H. Street&#x27;s 1940 novel &quot;Oh, Promised Land&quot;.

Loachapoka is the location of the first Rosenwald School.

== Government ==
Loachapoka is governed by a mayor and five town council members. However, in the most recent municipal election (2016), no incumbents submitted the qualifying paperwork to run for re-election. Therefore, the only citizen that did qualify for the ballot became mayor-elect, as per state law, and this was confirmed by the AL Director of Elections. When the mayor-elect brought the issue to light, several town, county and state officials worked together in a poorly hatched plan to improperly disqualify the only candidate to follow the law for qualification, as referenced in several newspaper articles and audio recordings of town hall meetings. The corruption portrayed in this series of events reflects a pattern of politics in Alabama that has been commonplace for many years, as reported in the Harvard Political Review.

==History==
Loachapoka was a Creek Indian town for some decades prior to white settlement. In the last census prior to the Native removal to Oklahoma, Loachapoka was found to have a population of 564. During the Creek War of 1836, Loachapoka was a center of rebellion; the town was destroyed by a force of Alabama and Georgia militia and friendly Creeks on May 15, 1836. Upon settlement by Euro-Americans, Loachapoka—temporarily renamed Ball&#x27;s Fork—became the regional trade center, a position that was reinforced in 1845 when it became the easternmost point on the railroad to Montgomery. Loachapoka&#x27;s influence peaked in the early 1870s, when its population reached nearly 1,300. Within a few years, a collapse of trade due to the Panic of 1873 and additional rail lines in the area sent Loachapoka into economic decline. Loachapoka roughly stabilized as a small farming community by the mid-20th century, and by the early 2000s (decade) had become a small-town suburb of Auburn. The mayor of Loachapoka is Zach Holmes.

==Culture==

Loachapoka was home to two fall festivals, both held on the same day each fall—the annual Syrup Sopping Day [to the south of Highway 14] and the Lee County Historical Fair [at Pioneer Park, to the north of Highway 14.] Many fairgoers were not aware that they were actually attending two celebrations of area history. The Syrup Sop featured the making of syrup in traditional methods from sorghum and ribbon cane. The Historical Fair featured life in the 1850s in east central Alabama. The two festivals were combined into one named Pioneer Day. Combined, the two events attract more than 20,000 people to Loachapoka annually. Loachapoaka is the hometown of country music singer Freddie Hart.

The Lee County Historical Society Museum is located in an 1845 general store in the Loachapoka historic district, located at &quot;Pioneer Park,&quot; a six and-a-half-acre park of nine buildings and five gardens reminiscent of the 1850s in east central Alabama.

==Demographics==
Loachapoka has appeared sporadically on census records. It first appeared as a separate community on the 1880 U.S. Census and again in 1890. It did not appear in 1900–1920, although one source said it did incorporate in 1910 with 359 residents, but this is not corroborated by the census of that year. In 1930, it appeared again, citing it had been incorporated in 1926. However, it failed to appear again in 1940, presumably losing its charter during the 1930s. It did not reincorporate again until 1974.

<text>Opelika (pronounced ) is a city in and the county seat of Lee County in the east-central part of the U.S. state of Alabama. It is a principal city of the Auburn-Opelika Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of Opelika is 30,995, an increase of 17.1 percent from the 2010 Census where the population was 26,477. The Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA with a population of 150,933, along with the Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area, comprises the Greater Columbus combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.

==History==
The Opelika area was first settled in 1832 after the Treaty of Cusseta was signed by the U.S. government and the Creek Nation. This treaty placed the land, and all other Creek territories east of the Mississippi River, under the possession of the United States government. Though the territory now belonged to the U.S., Opelika kept its Creek name, which translates to &quot;large swamp&quot;, from &quot;opilwa&quot; (swamp) and &quot;lako&quot; (big).

Two decades after settlement, Opelika was chartered as a town on February 9, 1854, thanks to its rapid growth. This growth was due to the Montgomery &amp; West Point Railroad Company&#x27;s rail lines, which traversed the town and served as major means of transportation for unprocessed cotton between the northern and southern territories.

Opelika later received a new charter in 1870, and its rapid growth continued. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900.

Opelika&#x27;s downtown was packed with saloons catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.

In 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the &quot;Bar room&quot; headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the &quot;Citizens&quot;. In a riot in late November–December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city&#x27;s charter and the governor sent in the militia to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city, a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city&#x27;s charter.

<text>Phenix City is a city in Lee and Russell counties in the U.S. state of Alabama, and the county seat of Russell County. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 38,817.

Phenix City lies immediately west across the Chattahoochee River from Columbus, Georgia and observes Eastern Time on a &quot;de facto&quot; basis (in contrast to the rest of Alabama, which observes Central Time) due to Phenix City&#x27;s strong economic ties to Columbus. Most of Phenix City is included in the Columbus Metropolitan Statistical Area, and the remainder is in Lee County and therefore included in the Auburn, Alabama Metropolitan Statistical Area. The entire city is part of the Columbus-Auburn-Opelika Combined Statistical Area.

In 2007, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; named Phenix City the nation&#x27;s no. 1 best affordable suburb to raise a family. It is home to Chattahoochee Valley Community College, a public, two-year college with an acceptance rate of 100%. Troy University has a satellite campus in Phenix City. It is also home to Phenix Lumber Company, which has been described as the deadliest workplace in the United States because of its high rate of accidents and safety violations.

As of 2023, the mayor is Eddie N. Lowe, the city&#x27;s first black mayor elected by the public. The city manager, who holds the task of organizational matters, is Wallace Hunter.

==Geography==
Phenix City is located at (32.472822, −85.020121). It is the easternmost settlement in the state of Alabama as well as the Central Time Zone, but it and some other nearby areas unofficially observe Eastern Time, as these areas are part of the metropolitan area of the considerably larger city of Columbus, Georgia, which is in the Eastern Time Zone and adjacent to the city across the Chattahoochee River to the east.

Several major highways run through Phenix City, namely U.S. routes 80, 280, and 431. U.S. Route 80 runs through the northern and western parts of the city, leading west to Tuskegee and northeast to Columbus, Georgia. U.S. 280 runs through the western part of the city from northwest to southeast, leading northwest to Opelika and southeast into Columbus. U.S. 431 runs north to south to the west of the city, concurrent with US 280, which it follows to Opelika, and leads south to Eufaula.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.61%) is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Phenix City has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==History==

What some claim was the last battle of the American Civil War, the Battle of Columbus, took place here on April 16, 1865, in Phenix City, then known as Girard. Union General James Wilson was met with Confederate opposition as he crossed the Chattahoochee River in an attempt to destroy the military industry of Columbus, Georgia.

Phenix City was initially two towns bordering each other on the north and south. On the south side was Girard, in Russell County, and the town of Brownville, on the north side, which was entirely within Lee County. Because a community in Tuscaloosa County already claimed the name of Brownville, post office officials insisted on the name of &quot;Lively&quot;. To compound the confusion, the nearby railroad depot was called Knight&#x27;s Station. Because residents preferred Brownville, on the 1880 U.S. census, it was listed as both Brownville and Lively. It was formally incorporated by the legislature on February 23, 1883.

Within the decade, the name would be changed to Phenix (or Phenix City), although some misspellings had it as &quot;Phoenix&quot;. It was not clear if it was named for Phenix Mills in nearby Columbus, Georgia or for the fabled bird. It appeared as Phenix City on the 1890 U.S. census and was incorporated as such on February 19, 1897, by the state legislature. The city&#x27;s official website displays the mythical phoenix, while the city&#x27;s seal also depicts a phoenix burning up in its nest. The &#x27;Our Community/History&#x27; page confirms the uncertainty behind the name: &quot;Although no definitive source reveals why this name was chosen.&quot;

On August 9, 1923, Russell County&#x27;s neighboring Girard (which made up most of current downtown Phenix City) and Lee County&#x27;s Phenix City formally merged, keeping the name of Phenix City. Because the consolidated city still remained divided into two counties, in 1932, the Lee County portion was moved entirely into Russell County (also cited for the redraw was to account for population shifts involved in the Auburn University opening and expansion). Lee County received the rural segment at Marvyn as compensation, which was formerly in Russell County&#x27;s northwest corner.

In 1926, the Russell County portion of Phenix City was designated the second county seat (the seat from 1868 had been at rural Seale). In 1934/35, Phenix City then became the sole county seat.

Phenix City was notorious during the 1940s and 1950s for being a haven for organized crime, prostitution, and gambling. Many of its customers came from the United States Army training center at Fort Benning, Georgia. The leaders of the crime syndicate in Phenix City were Jimmie Matthews and Hoyt Shepherd. Albert Patterson, from Phenix City, was elected to become attorney general of Alabama on a platform of reforming the city, but was shot and killed in 1954 outside his office on 5th Ave, north of 14th Street. As a result, the city had a negative reputation, and many people still associate this legacy with Phenix City. &quot;The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama&quot; by Margaret Ann Barnes chronicles these events, which led the small town to be known as &quot;Sin City, USA&quot;. The bordertown was the subject of an acclaimed film, &quot;The Phenix City Story&quot;, made in 1955.

In 1955, it won the All-America City Award from the National Municipal League.

Despite the city having been entirely annexed into Russell County in 1932, the growth of the city has spread northward back into Lee County, where it first appeared on 1980 U.S. Census records. , nearly 4,200 residents (out of almost 33,000) reside in the Lee County portion.

<text>Smiths Station is a city in Lee County, Alabama, United States. It is part of the Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area. At the time of the 2000 census, it was still a census-designated place (CDP), and its population was 6,756.

There is a high school in Ardmore, Alabama called “Ardmore High School” and it has around 1,008 students. The high school consists of two separate parts: the middle school, where grades six through eight attend, and the high school, where grades nine through twelve attend. 
The school was founded in 1915; the five acres of land cost a total of five dollars and was generously donated to the school. Residents of Ardmore helped construct the school building for an entire year. The original school building was only two stories tall. There were classrooms, a library, and a study hall area on the first floor, and they put a stage on the second floor of the building.

In 1917, the doors of the school opened to welcome its first students. Ten years later, Ardmore High School received its accreditation.

The school&#x27;s mission statement since its opening has been: &quot;The mission and purpose of Ardmore High School is to provide appropriate learning opportunities that promote academic, physical, and ethical growth of students enabling them to become productive citizens in an ever-changing society.&quot;

<text>Athens is a city in and the county seat of Limestone County, in the U.S. state of Alabama; it is included in the Huntsville-Decatur-Albertville, AL Combined Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city is 25,406.

==History==
Founded in 1818 by John Coffee, Robert Beaty, John D. Carroll, and John Read, Athens is one of the oldest incorporated cities in the state, having been incorporated one year prior to the state&#x27;s admittance to the Union in 1819. Limestone County was also created by an act of the Alabama Territorial Legislature in 1818. The town was first called Athenson, but was incorporated as Athens after the ancient city in Greece. The town&#x27;s first mayor was Samuel Tanner, and the Tanner area, south of Athens, was named on his behalf.

The Athens area was the home of William Wyatt Bibb, the first governor of Alabama, and its second governor, his brother Thomas Bibb, who succeeded him in office when he died in a fall from his horse.

In 1822, local residents purchased of land and constructed a building to house the Athens Female Academy. The school became affiliated with the Methodist church in 1842, and was eventually renamed Athens Female College. After becoming coeducational in 1932, the school changed its name again to Athens College. After being taken over by the State of Alabama in 1974, the college was converted to a &quot;reverse junior college&quot;, offering the last two years of instruction for graduates of area community colleges. It is today known as Athens State University.

Many homes in the central part of modern Athens date to the antebellum period, and are part of historic preservation districts.

On May 2, 1862, during the Civil War, Athens was seized by Union forces under the command of Col. John Basil Turchin. After occupying the town on May 2, 1862, Turchin assembled his men and reportedly told them: &quot;I shut my eyes for two hours. I see nothing&quot;. He did, in fact, leave the town to reconnoiter defensive positions, during which time his men ransacked the town. Turchin was later court-martialed over his treatment of Athens. The incident was controversial, and Lost Cause supporters vilified Turchin.

Athens was the home of Governor George S. Houston, Alabama&#x27;s first post-Reconstruction Democratic governor, who served from 1874 through 1878. Houston was noted for reducing the debts incurred to benefit private railroad speculators and others by his Reconstruction Republican predecessors. During Reconstruction, Athens was the home of the Trinity School, a school founded for the children of former slaves by Mary Fletcher Wells and funded by the American Missionary Association.

Athens was traditionally a cotton and railroad town, but since the local aerospace boom of the 1950s and 1960s, it has increasingly entered the orbit of nearby industry center Huntsville as the area&#x27;s cotton production has steadily declined.

Athens is the home of Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant, a Tennessee Valley Authority installation first operated in 1974, that was once the world&#x27;s largest nuclear plant. It provides many jobs to the area and most of the electricity for the Huntsville-Decatur Metro Area. On March 22, 1975, the Browns Ferry plant became the scene of what was, with the exception of the Three Mile Island accident, the most serious nuclear accident in United States history. A worker using a candle to check for air leaks started a fire among control wires, causing a temporary threat to operational control of the reactor (see Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant article on Unit One Fire).

On December 28, 2024, a high-end EF1 tornado struck downtown Athens causing significant damage to the Limestone Courthouse square and caused roof damage to many businesses in downtown Athens and several trees were uprooted including one outside the courthouse.

<text>Decatur () is the largest city and county seat of Morgan County (with a portion also in Limestone County) in the U.S. state of Alabama. Nicknamed &quot;The River City,&quot; it is located in northern Alabama on the banks of Wheeler Lake along the Tennessee River. The population was 57,938 at the 2020 census.

Decatur is the core city of the two-county large Decatur metropolitan area, with an estimated population of 157,425 in 2022. Combined with the Huntsville Metropolitan Area, the two create the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area, of which Decatur is the second-largest city.

Like many southern cities in the early 19th century, Decatur&#x27;s early success was based upon its location along a river. Railroad routes and boating traffic pushed the city to the front of North Alabama&#x27;s economic atmosphere. The city rapidly grew into a large economic center within the Tennessee Valley and was a hub for travelers and cargo between Nashville and Mobile, as well as Chattanooga and New Orleans. Throughout the 20th century, the city experienced steady growth but was eclipsed as the regional economic center by the fast-growing Huntsville during the space race. Decatur now finds its economy heavily based on manufacturing, mining, cargo transit, chemical, and high-tech companies such as Vulcan Materials, Daikin, Toray, and United Launch Alliance.

==History==


Initially, the area was known as &quot;Rhodes Ferry Landing&quot;, named for Dr. Henry W. Rhodes, an early landowner who operated a ferry that crossed the Tennessee River in the 1810s at the present-day location of Rhodes Ferry Park. The city was incorporated as Decatur in 1821. It was named in honor of Stephen Decatur; after he was killed in a duel in 1820, President Monroe directed that the Alabama town be named for him.

In the early 1830s, Decatur was the eastern terminus of the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad, the first railway built west of the Appalachian Mountains. In 1850, the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur was incorporated into the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad.

Because of its location on the Tennessee River at the strategically important crossing of two major railroads, Decatur was the site of several encounters during the American Civil War. When the Union Army occupied the city early in the war, the commanding general ordered all but four buildings in the town to be destroyed. Bricks from some of the churches in town were used to build stoves and chimneys for the buildings that housed soldiers. Three of the buildings that remained are still standing - the Old State Bank, the Dancy-Polk House, and the Burleson-Hinds-McEntire House. After the Union victory in the Battle of Atlanta, a Confederate army under the command of General John Bell Hood briefly sparred with a vastly outmanned garrison during the 1864 Battle of Decatur, when the city was referred to as &quot;A Tough Nut to Crack.&quot;

While the city was under Confederate control, plans for the Battle of Shiloh were mapped out within the Burleson-Hinds-McEntire House. These activities make the house one of the most historic buildings in Decatur.

New Decatur was a city that rose out of the ashes of former Decatur west of the railroad tracks. New Decatur was founded in 1887 and incorporated in 1889. However, residents of the older Decatur resented the new town, founded and occupied by people who moved down from northern states. Animosity was built until New Decatur renamed their town &quot;Albany&quot; after Albany, New York, in September 1916. The impetus to meld the two towns came from the need for a bridge, instead of a ferry, across the Tennessee River. The Decatur Kiwanis Club was formed with an equal number of members from each town to organize efforts to get the state to build the bridge. In 1925, the two cities merged to form one City of Decatur. There is a noticeable difference between the two sides of town. The cities developed differently at different times and still to this day have somewhat different cultures. Eastern portions of Decatur tend to act more suburban and traditional, while western portions tend to look more metropolitan and contemporary.

The Old State Bank, on the edge of downtown, is the oldest bank building in the State of Alabama, being 190 years old. The first wave pool in the United States was built in Decatur and is still in operation at the Point Mallard Aquatic Center. The city has the largest Victorian-era home district in the state of Alabama.

In the past, its industries included repair shops of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, car works, engine works, bottling plants, and manufacturers of lumber, sashes and blinds, tannic acid, fertilizers, cigars, flour, cottonseed oil, and various other products.

==Geography==
The Tennessee River has traditionally been the northern border of the city and Morgan County, but a small portion of the city extends across the river into Limestone County between U.S. 31 and I-65. Major bodies of water in the city include Wheeler Lake on the Tennessee River itself, plus Flint Creek, and Dry Branch, tributaries of the Tennessee River. The city extends to the other side of Flint Creek and the Refuge in the Indian Hills and Burningtree subdivision areas.

The northern portion of Decatur sits on top of a short hill that overlooks the Tennessee River; this creates a very steep dropoff to the river shore at Rhodes Ferry Park. This hill allows the &quot;Steamboat Bill&quot; Memorial Bridge to leave the mainland at grade without any major sloping required to cross the river while not interfering with Decatur&#x27;s heavy barge traffic. This hill extends from the banks of the river about south to the 14th St./Magnolia St. intersection with 6th Avenue (US 31).

South past the 14th St. and 6th Ave. intersection, land remains flat. South, and also west, past S.R. 67 there are a few minor ridges that sit within the city limits.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , is water. Decatur is southwest of Huntsville, north of Birmingham, and east of Muscle Shoals.

===Climate===
Decatur has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with four distinct seasons.

Winters are generally mild, with a January daily average temperature of . On average, the low temperature falls to the freezing mark or below on 59 days a year, and to or below on 9.2 days. Winters usually do not produce much snow; a large amount of snow is rare within the city limits. A small, measurable amount of snow can be experienced a few times each year.

There are 51–52 days of + highs annually and 1.7 days of + highs. Thunderstorms are common during the summer months. The latter part of summer tends to be drier. Autumn, which spans from mid-September to early-December, tends to be similar to spring in terms of temperature and precipitation, although it begins relatively dry.

Precipitation averages about 53.4 inches per year and on average, is relatively (and uniformly) heavy from November to July, with December the single wettest month on average; August through October are slightly drier months on average. Occasionally, severe thunderstorms occur. These storms can produce damaging winds and large hail in addition to the usual hazards of lightning and very heavy rain. There is also the risk of tornadoes. Severe thunderstorms can occur at any time of the year, but are most common during the spring months. A secondary severe weather season peaks in November. Occasionally from July to October, the Decatur area experiences strong winds and/or heavy to excessive rain from tropical disturbances. These commonly make landfall along the Gulf Coast as hurricanes but lose intensity as they move inland.

The highest recorded temperature was on July 28, 1952, and August 16, 1954, while the lowest recorded temperature was on January 30, 1966.

==Economy==
Decatur has grown to be the busiest river port on the Tennessee River. The Port of Decatur sees large amounts of barge traffic from up and down the Tennessee River, which has led to twelve Fortune 500 companies opening plants in the city. Major employers include General Electric, 3M, Wayne Farms, United Launch Alliance, Nucor, Bunge Limited, Daikin, Hyosung, Ascend Performance Materials, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Decatur is also known as the &quot;Home of Meow Mix&quot;, after the company bought a facility in town, and now utilizes its riverfront property to ship the finished product up and down the Tennessee River.

Being part of the Huntsville-Decatur CSA, the city lies within the region having the most engineers per capita in the nation.

A recent BRAC Base realignment will bring a population, conservatively estimated at 5,000−10,000 people (not including their families), to the area surrounding Redstone Arsenal.

Approval of the United Launch Alliance combined Lockheed-Martin and Boeing&#x27;s rocket manufacturing contracts to a central location at the plant in Decatur. All satellite launching rockets used by the U.S. government will be built in Decatur. This approval brought over 230 new jobs to the Decatur area. The ULA plant utilizes the Tennessee River to ship the rockets to Cape Canaveral.

In March 2008, a $1.3 billion development, including a Bass Pro Shops was announced for the Interstate 65/Interstate 565 interchange inside the city limits. The development, named Sweetwater, would have included more than of retail space, of medical and office space, 2,700 residences, and an entertainment venue with seating for up to 8,000 people. A school, fire department, parks and lakes were expected to support the future development. As of Spring 2010, this project still seems to be on the horizon, but there is no set date for the project to start. As of 2012, Bass Pro Shop has removed Decatur from its list of stores &quot;Coming Soon&quot; on its webpage. In 2013, Mayor Don Kyle announced that the &quot;Sweet Water&quot; complex was back on track, but has not announced whether Bass Pro Shops will be involved or not. Research from the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity suggests that the economic impact of Bass Pro Shops is typically limited despite the large subsidies the company often receives.

===Tourism===

==History==

Elkmont began as a stop known as &quot;Fort Hampton&quot; along the newly-constructed Tennessee and Alabama Central Railroad in 1859. The name was changed to &quot;Elkmont,&quot; after the elk that once flourished in the area, in 1866. The Tennessee and Alabama Central eventually became part of the L&amp;N Railroad system, which built the current depot (now used as a community center) in 1887. The railroad tracks have since been removed, and are now part of the Richard Martin Trail. Elkmont incorporated in 1873.

<doc id="104854" wikidata="Q79860" url="?curid=104854" title="Huntsville, Alabama">
<text>Huntsville is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Alabama. The population was 215,006 at the 2020 census and was estimated to be 225,564 in 2023, making it the 100th-most populous city in the U.S. The Huntsville metropolitan area had an estimated 527,000 residents in 2023 and is the second-most populous metro area in the state, after Birmingham. Huntsville is the seat of Madison County, with portions extending into Limestone County and Morgan County.

Huntsville is located in the Appalachian region of northern Alabama, south of the state of Tennessee. It was founded within the Mississippi Territory in 1805 and became an incorporated town in 1811. When Alabama was admitted as a state in 1819, Huntsville was designated for a year as the first capital, before the state capitol was moved to more central settlements. The city developed across nearby hills north of the Tennessee River, adding textile mills in the late nineteenth century.

Major growth in Huntsville took place in the decades following World War II. During the war, the U.S. Army established Redstone Arsenal in the vicinity, with a chemical weapons plant and related facilities. After the war, additional research was conducted at Redstone Arsenal on rockets, followed by adaptations for space exploration. NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center, the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command, and most recently the FBI&#x27;s operational support headquarters, all were sited at Redstone Arsenal.

==History==

The City of Huntsville was incorporated on November 25, 1811.

===Early history===
Due to settlement pressures after the United States gained independence, this area had become largely empty of indigenous peoples by the turn of the 19th century. An Indian trader and boatman named James Ditto established himself at a landing on the river prior to American settlement. Revolutionary War veteran John Hunt was a pioneer in 1805 on land around the Big Spring. The US negotiated an 1805 treaty with the Chickasaw and an 1806 treaty with the Cherokee who ceded their claims to land to the federal government.
The area was subsequently purchased by LeRoy Pope, who named it Twickenham after the home village of his distant kinsman Alexander Pope. Thomas Freeman and Roach started government surveys in 1805. Twickenham was carefully planned, with streets laid out in a northeast to southwest direction based on the flow of Big Spring. Given anti-British sentiment during this period after the Revolution and with tensions leading to the War of 1812, in 1811 the town name was changed to &quot;Huntsville&quot; to honor pioneer John Hunt.

Both John Hunt and LeRoy Pope were Freemasons and charter members of Helion Lodge #1, the oldest lodge in Alabama.

In 1811, Huntsville became the first incorporated town in what is now Alabama. However, the recognized &quot;founding&quot; year of the city is 1805, the year of John Hunt&#x27;s arrival. David Wade settled in Huntsville in 1817. He built the David Wade House on the north side of what is now Bob Wade Lane (Robert B. Wade was David&#x27;s grandson), just east of Mt. Lebanon Road.

===Emerging industries===
Huntsville&#x27;s initial growth was based on wealth generated by the sale of cotton from plantations, for which there was international demand, and trade associated with railroad industries. Many wealthy planters moved into the area from Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas to develop new cotton plantations. The invention of the cotton gin in the late eighteenth century meant that uplands areas could be profitably cultivated with short-staple cotton, which could be grown in a much larger area than the long-staple cotton of the Sea Islands and Low Country. The increased use of cotton meant an increased use of slave labor throughout the South as well.

Like the rest of Alabama, Huntsville was involved in the slave trade. Slaves worked in factories and on cotton plantations. Many cotton mills in the area relied on slave labor, most notably the Bell Factory, where slaves ran textile machinery. The factory was known throughout Alabama for its high levels of production. Cotton mills grew Huntsville and the South&#x27;s economies greatly, becoming 60% of all U.S. exports and connecting Huntsville to major cotton markets in Nashville, Memphis, and New Orleans. An 1822 census showed that out of the 1,300 inhabitants of Huntsville, 448 were slaves, making up 36% of the city&#x27;s population.

In 1819, Huntsville hosted a constitutional convention in Walker Allen&#x27;s large cabinet-making shop. The 44 delegates wrote a constitution for the new state of Alabama. In accordance with the new state constitution, Huntsville became Alabama&#x27;s first capital when the state was admitted to the Union. This was a temporary designation for one legislative session only. The capital was moved to more central cities in the state; to Cahaba, then to Tuscaloosa, and finally to Montgomery.

In 1855, the Memphis and Charleston Railroad was constructed through Huntsville, becoming the first railway to link the Atlantic seacoast with the lower Mississippi River.

===Civil War===
Huntsville initially opposed secession from the Union in 1861, but provided many men for the Confederacy&#x27;s efforts. The 4th Alabama Infantry Regiment, led by Col. Egbert J. Jones of Huntsville, distinguished itself at the Battle of Manassas/Bull Run, the first major encounter of the American Civil War. The regiment, which contained two Huntsville companies, were the first Alabama troops to fight in the war. They were also present when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House in April 1865. Nine generals of the war were born in or near Huntsville; five fought for the Confederacy and four for the Union. Other Huntsville residents joined the Union Army and helped establish the Union Army&#x27;s 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment.

On the morning of April 11, 1862, Union troops led by General Ormsby M. Mitchel seized Huntsville in order to sever the Confederacy&#x27;s rail communications and gain access to the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad. Huntsville was the headquarters for the Eastern Division of the Memphis &amp; Charleston.

During the first occupation, Union officers took over many of the larger homes in the city while the enlisted soldiers camped in tents mainly on the outskirts. Union troops searched for Confederate troops hiding in the town and weapons. There was not much resistance, and they treated Huntsville residents in a relatively civil manner. However, residents of nearby towns reported harsher treatment. Union troops were forced to retreat a few months later. In the fall of 1863, they returned to Huntsville, using it as a base of operations for the war in the South until the last months of 1864. According to the journal of a nearby resident, Union troops burned many homes and villages in the surrounding countryside in retaliation for the active guerrilla warfare in the area. Many houses and buildings were burned, although most of Huntsville was kept intact as it housed both Union officers and troops.

===After the Civil War===
During the Reconstruction era, three delegates from Huntsville attended the 1867 Constitutional Convention including Andrew J. Applegate, originally from Ohio, who went on to serve as Alabama&#x27;s first Lieutenant Governor. Councill Training School, which eventually became William Hooper Councill High School, was established as the first public school for African American students. It was named for educator and school founder William Hooper Councill.

Huntsville became a center for cotton textile mills, such as Lincoln, Dallas, and Merrimack. Each mill company constructed worker housing outside the city, creating communities that eventually included schools, churches, grocery stores, theaters, and hardware stores, all within walking distance of the mill. In many such company towns, workers were required to buy goods at the company stores, which sometimes overcharged them. The mill owners also established rules for behavior and could throw out workers from housing if they violated these policies. As was common for the time, work was highly segregated with only whites being allowed to work inside the mills and Blacks relegated to working outside as laborers and groundskeepers.

During the 1930s, industry declined in Huntsville due to the Great Depression. Huntsville became known as the Watercress Capital of the World because of its abundant harvest in the area. Madison County led Alabama in cotton production during this time.

===Military and NASA involvement===
By 1940, Huntsville was still relatively small, with a population of about 13,000 inhabitants. This quickly changed in early 1941 when the U.S. Army selected of land adjoining the southwest area of the city for building three chemical munitions facilities: the Huntsville Arsenal, the Redstone Ordnance Plant (soon redesignated Redstone Arsenal), and the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot. These operated throughout World War II, with combined personnel approaching 20,000. Resources in the area were strained as new workers flocked to the area, and the construction of housing could not keep up.

At the end of the war in 1945, the munitions facilities were no longer needed. They were combined with the designation Redstone Arsenal (RSA), and a considerable political and business effort was made in attempts to attract new tenants. One significant start involved manufacturing the Keller automobile, but this closed after 18 vehicles were built. With the encouragement of US Senator John Sparkman (D-AL), the U.S. Army Air Force considered this for a major testing facility, but selected another site. Redstone Arsenal was prepared for disposal, but Sparkman used his considerable Southern Democratic influence (the Solid South controlled numerous powerful chairmanships of congressional committees) to persuade the Army to choose it as a site for rocket and missile development.

As the Korean War started, the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) was given the mission to develop what eventually became the Redstone Rocket. This rocket set the stage for the United States&#x27; space program, as well as major Army missile programs, to be centered in Huntsville. Brigadier General Holger Toftoy commanded OGMC and the overall Redstone Arsenal. In early 1956, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) under Major General John Medaris was formed.

In 1950, about 1,000 personnel were transferred from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Redstone Arsenal to form the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC). Central to this was a group of about 200 German scientists and engineers, led by Wernher von Braun; they had been brought from Nazi Germany to the United States by Colonel Holger Toftoy under Operation Paperclip following World War II. Assigned to the center at Huntsville, they settled and raised families.
The city is nicknamed &quot;The Rocket City&quot; for its close association with U.S. space missions. On January 31, 1958, ABMA placed America&#x27;s first satellite, Explorer 1, into orbit using a Jupiter-C launch vehicle, a descendant of the Redstone. This brought national attention to Redstone Arsenal and Huntsville, with widespread recognition of this being a major center for high technology.

On July 1, 1960, 4,670 civilian employees, associated buildings and equipment, and of land were transferred from ABMA to form NASA&#x27;s George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Wernher von Braun was MSFC&#x27;s initial director. On September 8, President Dwight D. Eisenhower formally dedicated the MSFC.

During the 1960s, the major mission of MSFC was in developing the Saturn boosters used by NASA in the Apollo Lunar Landing Program. For this, MSFC greatly increased its employees, and many new companies joined the Huntsville industrial community. The Cummings Research Park was developed just north of Redstone Arsenal to partially accommodate this industrial growth, and has now become the second-largest research park of this type in America.

Huntsville was selected as the permanent home of the United States Space Operations Command in 2020, but in 2023 the Pentagon announced that the temporary headquarters would be expanded and remain in Colorado.

===Civil Rights Movement to modern day===
Huntsville was a key location in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1962, students from Alabama A&amp;M University held the city&#x27;s first lunch counter sit-in. After the mayor refused to address the protests, the Community Service Committee (CSC) was formed to help organize sit-ins and protests, as well as bail out arrested protestors. In April 1962, a committee was formed by the city to &quot;address the concerns of the African American community,&quot; and eight lunch counters, as well as a number of other public spaces, were desegregated. On May 11, 1962, Huntsville became the first city in Alabama to be racially integrated.

In June 1963, the admission of two Black students to the University of Alabama in Huntsville was challenged by Governor George Wallace. Wallace pushed back the registration dates for multiple state universities (presumably to allow more time for state troopers to move into the area) but instead moved them to Tuscaloosa. The students were admitted without issues. Around the same time, the color barrier was broken further when the first white person enrolled at Alabama A&amp;M University. In August 1963, a court ruling determined that Huntsville must desegregate their schools. Wallace used state troopers to stop four students from entering the first desegregated school. On September 6, the troopers announced that the desegregated schools were closed for three more days, but the Board of Education issued a statement denying the closure. When the schools opened on September 9, Wallace was served a restraining order against further interference with the desegregation of Huntsville schools. Huntsville became the first city in Alabama to desegregate its schools as well.

Alabama&#x27;s opposition to desegregation at this time caused concern from the NASA Administrator James E. Webb, who investigated equal employment opportunities for Black people in Huntsville. After failing to attract high-level staff to Huntsville, Webb said that &quot;some research work would have to be switched from Huntsville to New Orleans&quot;. This investigation into employment caused MSFC to open their engineering education programs to Black students at Alabama A&amp;M and Oakwood College, as well as for local contractors to &quot;work for progress in race relations&quot;.

The emergence of the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and a wide variety of advanced research in space sciences led to a resurgence in NASA-related activities that has continued into the 21st century. In addition, new Army organizations have emerged at Redstone Arsenal, particularly in the ever-expanding field of missile defense.

Huntsville also borders the cities of Decatur, Athens, Owens Cross Roads, the town of Mooresville as well as the census-designated places of Moores Mill, Meridianville, Laceys Spring, and Redstone Arsenal.

Situated in the Tennessee River valley, Huntsville is partially surrounded by several plateaus, large hills, and mountains. These plateaus are associated with the Cumberland Plateau. Monte Sano Mountain (Spanish for &quot;Mountain of Health&quot;) is the most notable and is east of the city, along with Round Top (Burritt), Chapman, Huntsville, and Green mountains. Others are Wade Mountain to the north, Rainbow Mountain to the west, and Weeden and Madkin mountains on the Redstone Arsenal property in the south. Brindley Mountain is visible in the south across the Tennessee River.

As with other areas along the Cumberland Plateau, the land around Huntsville is karst in nature. The city was founded around the Big Spring, which is a typical karst spring. Many caves perforate the limestone bedrock underneath the surface, as is common in karst areas. The National Speleological Society is headquartered in Huntsville.

===Climate===
Huntsville has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). It experiences hot, humid summers and generally mild winters, with average high temperatures ranging from near in the summer to during winter.

Huntsville is near the center of a large area of the U.S. mid-South that has maximum precipitation in the winter and spring, not summer. The average yearly precipitation is more than 54 inches. On average, the wettest single month is December, but Huntsville has a prolonged wetter season from November to May with, on average, nearly or over 5 or more inches of precipitation most of those months. On average, August to October represent slightly drier months (see climate chart, showing less than 3.6 inches of precipitation these months). Droughts can occur, primarily August through October, but usually there is enough rainfall to keep soils moist and vegetation lush. Much of Huntsville&#x27;s precipitation is delivered by thunderstorms. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring, and the most severe storms occur during the spring and late fall. These storms can deliver large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and tornadoes. Huntsville lies in a region colloquially known as Dixie Alley, an area more prone to violent, long-track tornadoes than most other parts of the US.

On April 27, 2011, the largest tornado outbreak on record, the 2011 Super Outbreak, affected northern Alabama. During this event, an EF5 tornado that tracked near the Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant destroyed many transmission towers and caused a multi-day power outage for the majority of North Alabama. That same tornado also resulted in considerable damage to the Anderson Hills subdivision and in Harvest, Alabama. In total, nine people were killed in Madison County, and many others were injured. Other significant tornado events include the Super Outbreak in April 1974, the November 1989 tornado that killed 21 and injured over 460, and the 1995 Anderson Hills tornado that killed one person and caused extensive damage. On January 21, 2010, an EF2 tornado struck Huntsville, resulting in moderate damage. Because it was not rain-wrapped and was easily photographed, it received extensive media coverage.

While most winters have some measurable snow, heavy snow is rare in Huntsville. However, there have been some unusually heavy snowstorms, like the New Year&#x27;s Eve 1963 snowstorm, when fell within 24 hours. Likewise, the Blizzard of 1993 and the Groundhog Day snowstorm in February 1996 were substantial winter events for Huntsville. On Christmas Day 2010, Huntsville recorded over of snow, and on January 9–10, 2011 it received at the airport and up to in the suburbs.

Huntsville has two active commercial rail lines. The mainline is run by Norfolk Southern, which runs from Memphis to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The original depot for this rail line, the Huntsville Depot, still exists as a railroad museum, though it no longer offers passenger service.

Another rail line, formerly part of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N), successor to the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&amp;StL), is being operated by the Huntsville and Madison County Railroad Authority (HMCRA). The line connects to the Norfolk Southern line downtown and runs south, passing near Ditto Landing on the Tennessee River, and terminating at Norton Switch, near Hobbs Island. This service, in continuous operation since 1894, presently hauls freight and provides transloading facilities at its downtown depot location. Until the mid-1950s, the L&amp;N provided freight and passenger service to Guntersville. The rail cars were loaded onto barges at Hobbs Island. The barge tows were taken upstream through the Guntersville Dam &amp; Locks and discharged at Port Guntersville. Remnants of the track supporting piers still remain in the river just upstream from Hobbs Island. The service ran twice daily. L&amp;N abandoned the line in 1984, at which time it was acquired by the newly created HMCRA, a state agency.

A third line, the Mercury and Chase Railroad, runs weekend tourist rides on part of another former NC&amp;StL and L&amp;N line from the North Alabama Railroad Museum&#x27;s Chase Depot, located in the community of Chase, Alabama. Their collection includes one of the oldest diesel locomotives in existence (1926). The rail line originally connected Huntsville to NC&amp;StL&#x27;s Nashville-to-Chattanooga mainline in Decherd, Tennessee.

The Huntsville-Madison County Rescue Squad is the county-wide volunteer rescue organization with tasks ranging from vehicle extrication to water rescues. The other is the Huntsville Cave Rescue Unit which is the region&#x27;s only all-volunteer cave rescue organization. It is tasked with cave, cliff and high angle rope rescues. These organizations are located in Huntsville but operate both in the city and outside with HCRU, responding to many cave rescue calls coming from caves well outside the city limits.
Huntsville Hospital in the downtown area is the largest hospital and trauma center. In 2021, Huntsville Hospital opened the Orthopedic &amp; Spine Tower, a seven-story building with 24 surgical orthopedic suites, which brings the total bed count to 881 for Huntsville Hospital. Located further south, Crestwood Medical Center is a smaller, 180-bed teaching hospital that is ranked nationally in two specialties. Huntsville Emergency Medical Services, Inc. (HEMSI) provides emergency medical services to Huntsville and surrounding Madison county. HEMSI operates from 12 stations with a fleet of 36 ambulances.

The Huntsville Police Department has three precincts and one downtown headquarters, over 500 sworn officers, 200 civilian personnel, and patrols an area of approximately 220 square miles. The department also boasts its own academy, which has been in operation since 1965.

Huntsville spent $1.2 million in 2015 to buy body cameras to be used by the Huntsville Police Department. Mayor Tommy Battle pushed for the purchase of the body cameras, saying: &quot;We can provide a trust situation with police and our general public.&quot; The mayor also said: &quot;Having that body cam there, having the police video there record what actually happens, and when people come in with complaints against Huntsville police officers, they get to see the action that actually happened.&quot;

Following the conviction of a former Huntsville police officer for murder, after he was originally cleared of any wrongdoing by the Police department, the City of Huntsville voted to change the way police shootings are reviewed. Beginning in August 2021, all shootings that result in death that occur by Huntsville Police are to be investigated by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency instead. The first investigation following the policy change started in January 2022 after an off-duty Huntsville police officer allegedly killed his girlfriend. The officer had initially reported the death as a suicide; however, it was later investigated as a homicide. An advisory council created by the city described actions by Huntsville Police department (HPD) as being &quot;in a manner that was, at a minimum, unprofessional and on multiple occasions in violation of HPD policy.&quot;

<doc id="104856" wikidata="Q79987" url="?curid=104856" title="Madison, Alabama">
<text>Madison is a city located primarily in Madison County, near the northern border of the U.S. state of Alabama. Madison extends west into neighboring Limestone County. The city is included in the Huntsville Metropolitan Area, the second-largest in the state, and is also included in the merged Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. The population was 56,933 at the 2020 census. Madison is bordered by Huntsville on all sides with some small unincorporated lands within Madison in Madison and Limestone counties.

Madison was mostly a small city for many years, with its population being around 400-500 for much of its history until the Redstone Arsenal was established to the southeast, which attracted many people to the area for jobs. This rapidly increased the city&#x27;s population and stimulated economic growth. Many of Madison&#x27;s residents work in Research Park or the Redstone Arsenal. Madison has been one of the fastest-growing cities in Alabama, as well as one of the wealthiest in the state. In 2022 census estimates, Madison was the 9th largest city in Alabama, The 8th densest city in Alabama, and the second largest city in North Alabama After Huntsville.

==History==
The area was occupied historically by the Koasati (also known as Coushatta), a Muskogean-speaking people. Before them were thousands of years of indigenous cultures.

Madison&#x27;s first European-American resident was John Cartwright, who settled in the area in 1818. The city was originally known as &quot;Madison Station&quot;, as it developed in the 1850s around a stop of the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad. Textile mills were built in the area in the late 19th century for processing and manufacture of cotton products.

Madison was the site of a battle in the American Civil War. On May 17, 1864, Col. Josiah Patterson&#x27;s 5th Alabama Cavalry, supported by Col. James H. Stuart&#x27;s cavalry battalion and a section of horse artillery, drove Col. Adam G. Gorgas&#x27;s 13th Illinois Infantry Regiment from the city. Patterson&#x27;s men captured the 13th Illinois Regiment&#x27;s wagon train, taking 66 prisoners. They also burned Union supplies and tore up the railroad tracks before retreating. Portions of the 5th Ohio Cavalry, the 59th Indiana Infantry, and the 5th Iowa Infantry were sent in pursuit from Huntsville. They skirmished with Patterson&#x27;s rear guard that evening at Fletcher&#x27;s Ferry on the Tennessee River south of Madison.

The town was incorporated on December 2, 1869. From 1880 to 1950, rural Madison had a population of some 400-500 residents.

In World War II and the postwar period, military and NASA operations were moved to Huntsville, stimulating an increase in population in the region. Subsidized highways stimulated suburbanization, attracting residents to outlying areas where new homes were built. By 1980, Madison&#x27;s population was 4,057. In the late 20th century, Madison&#x27;s population increased rapidly as it developed as a suburb of Huntsville. In 1986, Madison voters overwhelmingly voted to remain independent by not merging with Huntsville. By 2010, its population had grown to 42,938, and over the following ten years it grew to a population of 56,933.

<text>Mooresville is a town in Limestone County, Alabama, United States, located southeast of the intersection of Interstate 565 and Interstate 65, and north of Wheeler Lake.

The town is between Huntsville and Decatur, and is part of the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area; its population as of the 2010 census is 53, down from 59 in 2000.

Although the town&#x27;s per-capita income is over $50,000, Mooresville is within the area covered by the charter for the Appalachian Regional Commission, an organization whose goal is to help increase the per-capita income of impoverished areas. Mooresville is within Corridor V of the Appalachian Development Highway System.

The town was the primary filming location for Disney&#x27;s live action production of &quot;Tom and Huck&quot; (1995).

==History==
Mooresville is one of the oldest incorporated towns in Alabama, having been incorporated on November 16, 1818, when Alabama was still a Territory. It was named for early settlers, Robert and William Moore who located on land which became the site of Mooresville. Andrew Johnson, later to become to 17th president of the United States, lived in Mooresville as an apprentice tailor when he was a young man. The Union Army occupied Mooresville several times during the Civil War, and a few skirmishes were fought in the vicinity. Future U.S. president James Garfield, then a Union general camped in the area, delivered a sermon at the Mooresville Church of Christ in 1863. Mooresville thrived as a cotton farming hub until the early 20th century, when the boll weevil infestation wrecked the cotton economy.

The entire town, described as a picturesque early 19th century village, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Many of the older public buildings, including the Stagecoach Inn and Tavern, the Brick Church, the Post Office, and the Church of Christ, are owned and maintained by the town&#x27;s residents.

===Historic buildings===

*Stagecoach Inn and Tavern (1820s) – a frame building constructed before 1825 that served as an inn and post office. This building was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in the 1930s, and underwent extensive restoration in the 1990s.
*Mooresville Post Office (1840) – located at the corner of Lauderdale and High streets, this post office is the oldest in operation in Alabama and has call boxes dating before the American Civil War. Some of the call boxes have been owned by the same families since before the Civil War. The call boxes and some of the office furnishings actually predate the building, having been used in the nearby Stagecoach Inn and Tavern.
*Brick Church (1839) – a Greek Revival-style church built of handmade bricks that stands on Lauderdale Street. Originally a Presbyterian church, it later served as a Methodist church and a Baptist mission. The church&#x27;s recessed entrance is supported by two stucco-covered columns.

<text>The World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM ) is the largest international scout organization and was established in 1922. It has 176 members. These members are national scout organizations that founded WOSM or have subsequently been recognised by WOSM, which collectively have around 43 million participants.

== Table of members ==
WOSM recognizes only one Scout organization per country. Some countries have several organizations combined as a federation, with different component groups divided on the basis of religion (e.g., France and Denmark), ethnic identification (e.g., Israel), or language (e.g., Belgium). Canada is the only country to have two distinct recognized associations, which are divided by language. About 30 WOSM members are also members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, mostly from Europe and Arab countries.

<text>Benton is a town in Lowndes County, Alabama, United States. Its population was 41 at the 2020 census, down from 49 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Benton is located at (32.306248, -86.817551).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (8.82%) is water.

==History==
Settled in 1832 on land owned by James Maull, it was initially known as Maull&#x27;s Landing, before it was renamed and incorporated as Benton in 1834. It was named after Thomas Hart Benton, then the U.S. Senator from Missouri, who had served under General Andrew Jackson in the Creek Campaign. During the steamboat era, it was a major trading stop along the Alabama River.

Maull&#x27;s son, Edward, auctioned off lots in 1855, that were incorporated into the town. The earliest year any population figures were returned by the U.S. Census for the area (below the county level) was in 1870, when Benton Beat (then one of ten divisions in Lowndes County) returned 2,627 residents, the majority of whom were newly emancipated blacks.

In 1880, Lowndes County was subdivided further into 20 beats (precincts), and the Benton Beat fell to 1,094 residents. In 1890, it declined to 994, and for the first time, the town of Benton was reported separately with a population of 265.

Benton&#x27;s incorporation would lapse shortly (the town did not report a separate population in 1900) and with the shift to railroads, followed by the outmigration of the majority black population, it would dwindle in size. The Benton Precinct would fall from 1,049 in 1900 (same as its 1880 population), down to 409 by 1950, before all the county precincts were eliminated and redistricted into census divisions.

In 1964, Benton was reincorporated, reporting 115 residents as of the 1970 census. As of 1990, it has declined to just under 50 residents and has held steady as of 2010. Out of Lowndes County&#x27;s seven incorporated communities, it is one of only two with a white majority (as of 2000 and 2010), Lowndesboro being the other. It is also one of the smallest incorporated communities in the state.

Benton, Alabama can be confused in genealogy research with Calhoun County, Alabama, which was known as Benton County from 1832 to 1858, and which was also originally named for Senator Benton, but renamed because of his unpopular (in Alabama) political views — namely, opposition to slavery — by the late 1850s.

<doc id="104863" wikidata="Q68092" url="?curid=104863" title="Hayneville, Alabama">
<text>Hayneville is a town in Lowndes County, Alabama, United States and its county seat. At the 2010 census the population was 932, down from its record high of 1,177 in 2000. It is also part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area. It initially incorporated in 1831, but lapsed, finally reincorporating in 1967. Before 1970, the town appeared only twice on the U.S. Census: in 1850 and 1890. The 1850 estimate of 800 residents ranked it as the largest town in the county at the time.

Located in the fertile Black Belt region, Hayneville was the county seat in a plantation economy after Native Americans were removed that used slave labor for cotton production. The town was later a railway terminus and home to the Hayneville Railway Company, which was organized in 1903. Two years later, the company was reorganized as the Hayneville &amp; Montgomery Railroad Company and provided connections for shipping with the L&amp;N Railroad Company&#x27;s tracks.

==History==
===Settlement (1820-1831)===
Hayneville was founded in 1820 by settlers from the Edgefield, Abbeville, and Colleton districts of South Carolina on property purchased from the U.S. Land Office at Cahawba. Throughout the 1820s, Hayneville was known as &quot;Big Swamp&quot;. The indigenous Muscogee Creek people had been forced to cede their lands under various treaties with the United States, and most of them were removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

In 1831, after being chosen as the county seat of Lowndes County, the town was officially named Hayneville in honor of Robert Y. Hayne, governor of South Carolina and a U.S. senator.

===Late 19th and early 20th century===

During the early part of the 20th century, the boll weevil invaded the South, destroying cotton crops across the most productive counties. In the latter half of the 20th century, the agricultural focus shifted to more diverse crops and livestock. Hayneville, like the rest of the Black Belt, has struggled to develop a prosperous economy. Lowndes County Training School was established in Hayneville in 1913.

===Civil Rights Era and &quot;Bloody Lowndes&quot; (1965)===
Despite the county&#x27;s black majority, it had no registered black voters in the spring of 1965, after more than 60 years of disenfranchisement under the Alabama Constitution. Civil rights activists worked in Hayneville and Lowndes to organize residents in preparation for registration and voting. After passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 in August, activists provided residents with political education and helped them register to vote. They continued to work to integrate stores and public facilities. On August 13, 1965, Jonathan Daniels, an Episcopal seminarian from New Hampshire, worked with a group of 29 civil rights protesters to picket whites-only stores in the small town of Fort Deposit. All of the protesters were arrested by county police and taken to jail in nearby Hayneville. Five juvenile protesters were released the next day. The rest of the group was held for six days; they refused to accept bail unless everyone was bailed.

On August 20, the prisoners were released without transport back to Fort Deposit, and after release, the group waited by a road nearby the jail. Daniels, along with three others — a white Catholic priest and two black women activists—went to buy soft drinks at Varner&#x27;s Grocery Store, one of the few local stores that would serve non-whites. There, they encountered Tom L. Coleman, an engineer for the state highway department and unpaid special county deputy wielding a shotgun. The man threatened the group, and finally leveled his gun at seventeen-year-old Ruby Sales. Daniels pushed Sales to the ground and caught the full blast of the gun, which killed him instantly. Father Richard F. Morrisroe grabbed the other protester and ran. Coleman shot Morrisroe, wounding him in the lower back. White resistance to civil rights organizers continued.

In June 1965, Gregory Orr, a student from upstate New York who traveled to Mississippi to take part in civil rights protests, was driving home from the capital of Jackson. He had been arrested there with other protesters and held without charges for 10 days at the state fairgrounds. While driving through Lowndes County, he was stopped by white vigilantes, kidnapped and held without charges for eight days in the Hayneville courthouse jail. Back in New York that August, Orr read a report of the murder of Jonathan Daniels in &quot;The New York Times.&quot; He recognized one of his kidnappers in a photograph—apparently Tom Coleman. Numerous other incidents have been documented in the county of violence against civil rights people.

Civil rights activities in Lowndes continued in the county under the leadership of Stokeley Carmichael, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and local residents, to educate and register blacks to vote after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They organized the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LFCO), the first independent black political party in the county since Reconstruction era, and continued to register voters. They ran a slate of candidates in 1966 but lost due to election fraud in the majority-black county. In 1970, African-American chairman of LCFO John Hulett was elected as county sheriff.

===Incorporation (1967-1968)===
The incorporation of Hayneville as a town began in July 1967 with the vision of 25 qualified electors of the county and residents of the Hayneville community. Two subsequent attempts were made for incorporation, the last resulting in favor of incorporation. Only one person filed for a statement of candidacy and was nominated for the office of Mayor and five places on the town council. Therefore, due to the completion of the requirements of incorporation, the court declared on July 15, 1968, by Probate Judge Harold Hammond, that Hayneville was completely incorporated.

<text>Lowndesboro is a town in Lowndes County, Alabama, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 115, down from 140 in 2000. It is part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area. Although initially incorporated in 1856 by an act of the state legislature, it lapsed and was not reincorporated until 1962.

As of the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Censuses, Lowndesboro, along with Benton, are the only two towns (out of 7) in Lowndes County with a white majority of residents. Both are the 6th (Lowndesboro) and 7th (Benton) smallest communities.

==History==
Originally known as McGill&#x27;s Hill, the community began attracting settlers following the conclusion of the Creek War. In 1832, the residents changed the name to Lowndesboro in honor of U.S. Congressman William Lowndes, the son of Rawlins Lowndes, an early South Carolina governor.

With its proximity to the Alabama River, the community had grown into a prosperous town by the 1830s. Many wealthy planters settled in the area, leaving a legacy of historic mid-19th-century architecture that largely survived intact into the modern era. A brief skirmish was fought at Lowndesboro in April 1865 between a group of Confederate cavalry and advance troops of the Union Army during Wilson&#x27;s Raid. Federal troops occupied the town after driving off the Confederate force, with very little destruction noted from the occupation, thus preserving many of the antebellum houses and structures in the Lowndesboro Historic District.

Like many small Southern communities with an economy based on cotton production and trade, Lowndesboro declined rapidly in the post-war years. At least partially attributed to this decline was the survival of much of the pre-war architecture into the 20th century, making it a unique assemblage of 19th-century architecture. Today much of the town is included in the Lowndesboro Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Dicksonia Plantation ruins are also a notable place of interest.

Lowndesboro was the site of a number of significant events in the civil rights movement. On March 25, 1965, civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo was shot to death during a high-speed chase by Ku Klux Klan members on U.S. Route 80, while driving to Montgomery to pick up a group of demonstrators waiting to return to Selma after the Selma-to-Montgomery march. The Klansmen spotted the white Liuzzo and her black passenger, Leroy Moton, at a stoplight in Selma, catching up to the pair about two miles (3 km) west of Lowndesboro.

In 1966, a number of Lowndes County African-American families were evicted from their homes in retaliation for their participation in the movement. Twenty of these families set up a tent city outside of Lowndesboro rather than flee the area.

<text>Franklin is a rural town in Macon County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 590.

==History and educational legacy==
The Muscogee (Creek) people had long been cultivating lands in this area, producing crops of maize, squash and beans (the Three Sisters), and tobacco, used primarily for ritual purposes. Osceola (1804-1838), who became well known as a leader of the Seminole people in Florida, was born to a Creek woman at Red Creek, 10 miles from the Tallapoosa River. He was of mixed race but identified as Creek; the people have a matrilineal kinship system.

Franklin has been home to many churches for more than 200 years. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a Methodist Missionary Church operated here for the Creek. It had two cemeteries, one for whites and one for the Creek. James McQueen, a Scots trader who lived here and married a Creek woman, was great-grandfather of Osceola. McQueen is buried in the Indian cemetery.

After the Creek were forced to cede their lands, European Americans developed the area for cotton cultivation. They depended on the labor of enslaved African Americans, many of whom were initially transported to this region from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade. Cotton continued as the chief commodity crop after the Civil War.

Residents established Franklin School by the 1890s, teaching grades 1–11 of white students. By the mid-1930s, the upper grades had been moved to another facility, and it held grades 1–6. Northern and southern classrooms were adjoined by a common auditorium. The school&#x27;s original water source was a spring near the buildings. A well was later dug in the front yard of the school, with a hand pump to get water. Heat was provided by a wood-burning potbelly stove. Each student brought a stick of wood every morning to burn in the stove.

The school closed in 1942, and its 75–80 students transferred to Tuskegee schools. After the school closed, the northern classroom was moved to its current location and converted to a community center. The rest of the school was torn down.

In the mid-20th century, musician Hank Williams Sr. often performed at dances at the community center. Upon Franklin&#x27;s incorporation in 1977, the town began using the community center building as the town hall. A mile north of Town Hall lay the remnants of what is rumored to be the first school in Macon County.
Harris Barrett School was built in 1903 with handmade bricks made by students of the Tuskegee Normal School (now Tuskegee University), under the direction of Booker T. Washington. In the segregated system of public facilities, the Barrett School was reserved for African-American students, who were mostly descendants of freedmen in this rural area. Both the Barrett School and the Tuskegee Institute played a major role in education in the Franklin community. They operated an experimental farm on the west side of Baldwin Farm Road. Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver were both active in farming in Franklin, and assisted farmers both black and white. Harris Barrett School was restored and is operated as a historic museum; it is located at the corner of Co. Rd. 27 and 36.

<doc id="104869" wikidata="Q79718" url="?curid=104869" title="Tuskegee, Alabama">
<text>Tuskegee ( ) is a city in Macon County, Alabama, United States. General Thomas Simpson Woodward, a Creek War veteran under Andrew Jackson, laid out the city and founded it in 1833. It became the county seat in the same year and it was incorporated on February 13, 1843. It is the most populous city in Macon County. The population was 9,395 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 8,765 in 2023.

Tuskegee has been important in African-American history and highly influential in United States history since the 19th century. Before the American Civil War the area was developed for cotton plantations, dependent on enslaved African-American people.

After the war many freedmen continued to work on plantations in the rural area, which was devoted to agriculture, primarily cotton as a commodity crop. In 1881, the Tuskegee Normal School (now Tuskegee University, a historically black college) was founded by Lewis Adams, a former slave whose father, Jesse Adams, a white slave owner had allowed him to be educated. Its first founding principal was Booker T. Washington, who developed a national reputation and philanthropic network to support education of freedmen and their children.

In 1923, the Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center was established, initially for the estimated 300,000 African-American veterans of World War I in the South, when public facilities were racially segregated. Twenty-seven buildings were constructed on the 464-acre campus.

The city was the subject of a civil rights case, &quot;Gomillion v. Lightfoot&quot; (1960), in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the state legislature had violated the Fifteenth Amendment in 1957 by gerrymandering city boundaries as a 28-sided figure that excluded nearly all black voters and residents, and none of the white voters or residents. The city&#x27;s boundaries were restored in 1961 after the ruling.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tuskegee&quot; comes from Spanish &quot;Tasquiqui&quot;, which came from the Muskogee word &quot;Taskeke&quot;, meaning &quot;warriors&quot;. The Native American town of Tasquique was located on the Chattahoochee River just south of present-day Columbus, Georgia.

==History==
The Creek people long occupied this area including a settlement known as Taskigi Town. After Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 in furtherance of President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s goals, most of the Creek bands were removed from their homelands in the Southeast to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

Pioneer white planters and other migrants moved into the area, mostly from eastern Southern states. The planters brought or purchased enslaved African Americans to clear woods and develop cotton plantations. Invention of the cotton gin had made short-staple cotton profitable to process and it became the chief commodity crop of the Deep South through the 19th century. Short-staple cotton could be cultivated in the upland areas of Georgia. Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. Designated as the county seat of rural Macon County, Tuskegee developed as its only city.

===Late 19th century===
In 1881, the young Booker T. Washington was hired to develop the Tuskegee Normal School for Colored Teachers on the grounds of a former plantation. It was founded to train teachers for the segregated school system and freedmen for self-sufficiency. Washington established a work-study program by which students practiced skills and trades. Over the decades, the programs were expanded. This was later named the Tuskegee Institute. Graduate courses were added and it became Tuskegee University.

Washington was known for his emphasis on education and self-improvement. The institute became known for stressing a practical education with work experience by students, to prepare them for the agricultural and mechanical work available in the small towns and rural areas to which most would return. Teaching was a highly respected calling, as education was a major goal among the freedmen and their children. Washington believed that African Americans would achieve acceptance by Southern whites when they had raised themselves.

Washington led the school for decades, building a wide national network of white industrialist donors among some of the major philanthropists of the era, including George Eastman. At the same time, Washington secretly provided funding for its legal defense of some highly visible civil rights cases, including supporting challenges to Southern states&#x27; discriminatory constitutions and practices that disenfranchised African Americans. Washington worked with Julius Rosenwald and architects at the college to develop models for rural schools, to be used with Rosenwald&#x27;s matching funds to build more schools for black children in the South.

===Early 20th century===
Beginning in 1932, the school was the site of the now-infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932–1972), started to test treatments of the disease. 600 African-American men became involved, being offered free medical care by the U.S. government for their participation, while being unwittingly tested for syphilis. With funding cut by the Great Depression, staff cut back on medication to treat the disease and studied the effects of untreated syphilis on patients and their sexual partners. Those in the study who had syphilis were not told, nor were they informed that treatment was available for their disease, even after antibiotics had been developed.

One of the most famous teachers at Tuskegee was George Washington Carver, whose name is synonymous with innovative research into Southern farming methods and the development of hundreds of commercial products derived from regional crops, including peanuts and sweet potatoes.

During World War II, Tuskegee and Tuskegee Institute were also home to the famed Tuskegee Airmen. This was the first squadron of African-American pilots trained in the U.S. Military for service in that war.

Tuskegee University in the 21st century is a center of excellence for African-American education. The heart of the university has been designated as a National Historic District and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

The Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center was opened in 1923, authorized by Congress. A total of 27 buildings were constructed on the 464-acre campus, which provided housing and a hospital to serve the needs of more than 300,000 African-American veterans in the South from World War I. It attracted doctors from top schools, such as Dr. Toussaint Tourgee Tildon, a graduate of Harvard Medical School. He was one of the first six African-American doctors to work at the hospital; as director of the complex for 12 years (1946–1958), he achieved accreditation for a medical residency program at the hospital. He also worked to ensure accessibility for graduates to good medical positions in the federal government.

In the 1930s, a group of black men from the Tuskegee Men&#x27;s Club began efforts to get more black voters registered. Beginning in 1941, the group reorganized under the name the Tuskegee Civic Association (TCA). With the group&#x27;s consistent effort to register more voters, the area&#x27;s statistics of registered black voters continued to increase. The group and potential voters were often met with obstacles that prevented them from being successful. The surrounding black community showed support and wanted to recognize black leaders in the community. The work of the TCA also had a huge emphasis on educating their communities on various civic duties. Though the existing support for the TCA was not often vocalized, many black community members wanted to challenge the political system that was present in Macon County. The group shed a light on the disparities in the numbers of black people applying for voter registration and those who were successful, even going as far as talking to the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

===Voting rights challenge===

Following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, activists made progress in registering black voters in the city. African Americans in Tuskegee and other Alabama cities had been largely disenfranchised after passage of a new state constitution in 1901, which included requirements that were discriminatory in practice, including a poll tax and literacy tests.

In 1957, a total of 1000 voters were registered, with the 400 registered black voters nearly equaling the number of white voters. But in the city, African Americans outnumbered whites on a four-to-one basis; among them were many highly educated, professional African Americans working at the Tuskegee Institute and the Veterans Administration hospital. That year, without debate and against the protests of many African Americans, the state legislature redrew the boundaries of the city, enacting Local Law 140, which created an irregular, 28-sided city boundary that left only ten black voters within the newly defined city, and excluded 420 black voters. Those excluded included the entire professional staff of the Institute and the hospital. No white voters were excluded by the change.

The law was intended to guarantee that minority whites could retain control of the city even if more blacks succeeded in the arduous process of registering to vote. Some 3,000 African-American residents protested passage of the law at a church in Tuskegee; they also began an economic boycott of white businesses in the city. They referred to the boycott as a &quot;selective buying campaign&quot; due to the fact that boycotting was illegal under state law. It lasted about four years, during which twenty-six businesses operated by white proprietors closed down.

African Americans also organized a legal challenge to the law, supported by the NAACP, in a case known as &quot;Gomillion v. Lightfoot&quot;. The law was initially upheld by the US District Court and affirmed by the Appeals Court based in New Orleans. However, it was struck down by the US Supreme Court in 1960, with the ruling implemented in 1961. The court ruled that the gerrymandering of city boundaries was racially motivated and violated the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which states that &quot;states were not insulated from federal judicial review when they jeopardized federally protected rights.&quot; The exclusionary gerrymandering was overturned and the previous boundaries of the city were restored.

This case was cited in the later &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1964), in which the Supreme Court ruled that Tennessee&#x27;s malapportionment of election districts violated civil rights. It ruled that representation in both houses of all state legislatures had to be based on population, under the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; doctrine, and that such districts had to be regularly updated to reflect population changes.

===Post-&quot;Gomillion&quot;===
 In 1963, Tuskegee was to have been the first Alabama community to comply with a federal order to desegregate its public schools. The school superintendent, C.A. (Hardboy) Pruitt, at first opposed the admission of Black students, but worked with other community leaders to comply with the final order of the federal district court, with plans to admit 13 Black students in September 1963 to what had been an all-white high school. But Gov. George Wallace opposed compliance with the federal order anywhere in the state on the grounds that it would lead to violence. Behind the scenes, Wallace enlisted the aid of Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis of the National States&#x27; Rights Party to gin up protests calling for the closing of schools that were scheduled to integrate. Wallace subsequently ordered public schools closed across the state and deployed state troopers on September 3, 1963, to block the opening of Tuskegee High School. The school was integrated on September 10, 1963, after President John F. Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard and 13 Black students were among only 165 students to begin the school year, against a total enrollment of about 550.

Johnny Ford was elected the first black mayor of the city in 1972, and served six consecutive terms in office. Lucenia Williams Dunn was elected the first black woman mayor in 2000.

==Governance==

In the 21st century, Tuskegee has a council–manager government led by a four-member city council, a mayor, and an appointed city manager.

The city council acts as a legislative body of the city, passing laws and regulations and appointing citizens to the city&#x27;s various boards. Each member of the city council is elected for a four-year term from one of three geographic single-member districts. Tuskegee has one city council member who is elected at-large to a four-year term and serves as mayor-pro tem. The duties of the mayor are to promote the city, communicate with residents, and preside over City Council meetings. As such, the position of mayor in Tuskegee is primarily ceremonial.

==Geography==
Tuskegee is located at (32.4240286, -85.6916195).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and (1.56%) is water.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Tuskegee has a humid subtropical climate (abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Attractions==

Downtown Tuskegee includes historical sites from the time of incorporation to the present. It also has the Tuskegee Visitor Center.

==Demographics==
The table at right shows the effects of the state passing a law in 1957 to redefine the city of Tuskegee in a way that excluded nearly all black residents, dramatically reducing the population by 1960. The city and other officials were sued under &quot;Gomillion v. Lightfoot&quot; (1960); the US Supreme Court ruled against the state&#x27;s action. The city boundaries were reinstituted, as reflected by the dramatic &quot;increase&quot; of population in the city recorded in 1970. The population in 1960, with the restored borders, was 7,240, according to the 1970 U.S. Census. Because of lack of economic opportunities in the largely rural area, both the city and rural county have lost population since the late 20th century.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 29 and U.S. Route 80 pass through Tuskegee. State Route 81 goes north from the town. Four miles north up Route 81 is the interchange with Interstate 85.

A short distance beyond I-85 is the hamlet of Chehaw, where Southern Railway passenger trains made stops at the Western Railway of Alabama Depot. Into the mid-1960s both the Southern&#x27;s &quot;Crescent&quot; and its &quot;Piedmont Limited&quot; made stops at the depot. The railway&#x27;s &quot;Crescent&quot; was the last train to make stops at the station. The Southern Railway moved the train out in 1970 for a rerouting from an Atlanta-Montgomery-New Orleans itinerary to an Atlanta-Birmingham-New Orleans itinerary.

<doc id="104871" wikidata="Q1261666" url="?curid=104871" title="Harvest, Alabama">
<text>Harvest is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in the northwestern part of Madison County, Alabama, United States, and is included in the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the population of the community is 5,893.

== History ==

The Harvest area was originally part of Cherokee lands until the early 1800s. From the late 1800s through the early 1900s, Harvest saw growth and development resulting from the construction and operation of a rail line southward from Fayetteville, Tennessee. The Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis (NC&amp;StL) Railway eventually acquired the rail line. In the early-to-mid-1900s, Harvest was centered around the railroad between the communities of Capshaw (the line&#x27;s terminus) and Toney. Many early settlers in the Harvest area were from the Fayetteville area. In 1929, the NC&amp;StL abandoned the line, pulled up the rails and transferred the right-of-way to the Madison County Highway Department with a quitclaim deed. Today, that roadbed is a two-lane roadway that continues to serve as a vital link in the modern day-to-day transportation network, and carries the appropriate name, “Old Railroad Bed Road.”

On April 3, 1974, during the 1974 Super Outbreak, two F5 tornadoes struck the community within 30 minutes of each other. Most of Harvest, primarily along the Old Railroad Bed Road area, and other nearby communities, including Tanner, was destroyed. Fifty people were killed by the tornadoes.

Harvest was hit by another violent tornado on May 18, 1995, that devastated the Anderson Hills subdivision. This F4 tornado killed one person.

On April 27, 2011, during the 2011 Super Outbreak, Harvest suffered significant damage from the EF5 tornado that destroyed the towns of Hackleburg and Phil Campbell, primarily north of Nick Davis Road, situated between Old Railroad Bed Road and Wall Triana Highway. The Anderson Hills subdivision was once again devastated, and damage in Harvest was rated EF4. The tornado killed 72 people along its path.

On March 2, 2012, during the tornado outbreak of March 2–3, 2012, Harvest suffered yet another direct hit from a damaging tornado, this one rated EF3. It hit the same area as the April 27, 2011, tornado, though no fatalities occurred this time. Some of the houses being rebuilt from the previous outbreak were destroyed again.

==Geography==
Harvest is located at (34.852827, -86.748047).
