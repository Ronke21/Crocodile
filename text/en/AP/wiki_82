<text>The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, also known as the Great Exhibition or the Crystal Palace Exhibition (in reference to the temporary structure in which it was held), was an international exhibition that took place in Hyde Park, London, from 1 May to 15 October 1851. It was the first in a series of world&#x27;s fairs, exhibitions of culture and industry that became popular in the 19th century. The event was organised by Henry Cole and Prince Albert, husband of Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom.

Famous people of the time attended the Great Exhibition, including Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Michael Faraday (who assisted with the planning and judging of exhibits), Samuel Colt, members of the Orléanist royal family and the writers Charlotte Brontë, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, George Eliot, Alfred Tennyson, and William Makepeace Thackeray. The future Arts and Crafts proponent William Morris, then a teenager, later said he refused to attend the Exhibition on the grounds of taste. The opening music, under the superintendence of William Sterndale Bennett, was directed by George Thomas Smart. Organised by Howard Staunton, the first international chess tournament took place at the Exhibition. The world&#x27;s first soft drink, Schweppes, was the official sponsor of the event.

==Background==
The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations was organised by Prince Albert, Henry Cole, Francis Henry, George Wallis, Wentworth Dilke, and other members of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce as a celebration of modern industrial technology and design. It was arguably a response to the highly effective French Industrial Exposition of 1844: indeed, its prime motive was for Britain to make &quot;clear to the world its role as industrial leader&quot;. Prince Albert, Queen Victoria&#x27;s consort, was an enthusiastic promoter of the self-financing exhibition; the government was persuaded to form the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 to establish the viability of hosting such an exhibition. Queen Victoria visited three times with her family, and 34 times on her own. Although the Great Exhibition was a platform on which countries from around the world could display their achievements, Britain sought to prove its own superiority. The British exhibits at the Great Exhibition &quot;held the lead in almost every field where strength, durability, utility and quality were concerned, whether in iron and steel, machinery or textiles.&quot; Britain also sought to provide the world with the hope of a better future. Europe had just emerged from &quot;two difficult decades of political and social upheaval,&quot; and now Britain hoped to show that technology, particularly its own, was the key to a better future.

Sophie Forgan says of the exhibition that &quot;Large, piled-up &#x27;trophy&#x27; exhibits in the central avenue revealed the organisers&#x27; priorities; they generally put art or colonial raw materials in the most prestigious place. Technology and moving machinery were popular, especially working exhibits.&quot; She also notes that visitors &quot;could watch the entire process of cotton production from spinning to finished cloth. Scientific instruments were found in class X, and included electric telegraphs, microscopes, air pumps and barometers, as well as musical, horological and surgical instruments.&quot;

A special building, or &quot;The Great Shalimar&quot;, was built to house the show. It was designed by Joseph Paxton with support from structural engineer Charles Fox, the committee overseeing its construction including Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and went from its organisation to the grand opening in just nine months. The building was architecturally adventurous, drawing on Paxton&#x27;s experience designing greenhouses for the sixth Duke of Devonshire. It took the form of a massive glass house, 1848 feet long by 454 feet wide (about 563 metres by 138 metres) and was constructed from cast iron-frame components and glass made almost exclusively in Birmingham and Smethwick. From the interior, the building&#x27;s large size was emphasized with trees and statues; this served, not only to add beauty to the spectacle, but also to demonstrate man&#x27;s triumph over nature. The Crystal Palace was an enormous success, considered an architectural marvel, but also an engineering triumph that showed the importance of the exhibition itself. The building was later moved and re-erected in 1854 in enlarged form at Sydenham Hill in south London, an area that was renamed Crystal Palace. It was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936.

Six million people—equivalent to a third of the entire population of Britain at the time—visited the Great Exhibition. The average daily attendance was 42,831 with a peak of 109,915 on 7 October. Thomas Cook arranged travel to the event for 150,000 people and it was important in his company&#x27;s development. The event made a surplus of £186,000 (£33,221,701.65 in 2023), which was used to found the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum. They were all built in the area to the south of the exhibition, nicknamed Albertopolis, alongside the Imperial Institute. The remaining surplus was used to set up an educational trust to provide grants and scholarships for industrial research; it continues to do so today.

The exhibition caused controversy as its opening approached. Some conservatives feared that the mass of visitors might become a revolutionary mob. The English-born King Ernest Augustus I of Hanover, shortly before his death, wrote to Lord Strangford about it: 
The folly and absurdity of the Queen in allowing this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on the occasion. The idea ... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us in the eyes of Europe.

In modern times, the Great Exhibition is a symbol of the Victorian Age, and its thick catalogue, illustrated with steel engravings, is a primary source for High Victorian design. The Albert Memorial to the exhibition, crowned with a statue of Prince Albert, is located behind the Royal Albert Hall. It is inscribed with statistics from the exhibition, including the number of visitors and exhibitors (British and foreign), and the profit made.

A range of medals were produced and awarded to exhibitors, jurists and providers of services.

== Exhibits ==
The official descriptive and illustrated catalogue of the event lists exhibitors not only from throughout Britain but also from its &quot;Colonies and Dependencies&quot; and 44 &quot;Foreign States&quot;. Numbering 13,000 in total, the exhibits included a Jacquard loom, an envelope machine, kitchen appliances, steel-making displays and a reaping machine that was sent from the United States.

*The Mintons stand exhibited ceramics including majolica which proved a world-wide success. 
*The Koh-i-Noor, meaning the &quot;Mountain of Light&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest known diamond at the time, was one of the most popular attractions of the India exhibit.
*The Daria-i-Noor, one of the rarest pale pink diamonds in the world, was shown.
*The early 8th-century Tara Brooch, discovered only in 1850, the finest Irish penannular brooch, was exhibited by the Dublin jeweller George Waterhouse along with a display of his fashionable Celtic Revival jewellery.
*Alfred Charles Hobbs used the exhibition to demonstrate the inadequacy of several respected door locks.
*Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a precursor to the fax machine.
*Mathew Brady was awarded a medal for his daguerreotypes.
*William Chamberlin, Jr. of Sussex exhibited what may have been the world&#x27;s first voting machine, which counted votes automatically and employed an interlocking system to prevent over-voting.
*The first modern pay toilets were installed, with 827,280 visitors paying the penny fee to use them. The toilets remained even after the exhibition was dismantled. &quot;Spending a penny&quot; became a euphemism for using a toilet.
*Firearms manufacturer Samuel Colt demonstrated his prototype for the 1851 Colt Navy and also his older Walker and Dragoon revolvers.
*The Tempest prognosticator, a barometer using leeches, was demonstrated.
*The America&#x27;s Cup yachting event was instigated with a race held in conjunction with the Great Exhibition.
*Gold ornaments and silver enamelled handicrafts fabricated by the Sunar caste from Sind, British India.
*C.C. Hornung of Copenhagen, Denmark, showed his single-cast iron frame for a piano, the first made in Europe.
*&quot;The Trophy Telescope&quot;, so called because it was considered the &quot;trophy&quot; of the exhibition, was shown. Its main lens of 11 inches (280 mm) aperture and 16 feet (4.9 m) focal length was manufactured by Ross of London. The German equatorial mounting was made by Ransome &amp; May of Ipswich.
*The instrument maker J. S. Marratt exhibited a five-foot achromatic telescope and a transit theodolite used in surveying, tunnelling, and for astronomical purposes.
* Asprey exhibited a kingwood and ormolu mounted lady&#x27;s dressing case with silver-gilt contents bearing the &quot;Annie&quot; cipher.
*The emphasis of the New Zealand exhibit featured natural resources, as well as crafted items made by Māori, such as flax baskets, carved wooden objects, eel traps, mats, fish hooks and hand clubs.

== Admission fees ==
Admission prices to the Crystal Palace varied according to the date of visit, with ticket prices decreasing as the parliamentary season drew to an end and London traditionally emptied of wealthy individuals. Prices varied from two guineas (£ in 2015) (three guineas for a man) for a season ticket, or £1 per day (for the first two days only), then reducing to five shillings per day (until 22 May). The admission price was then further reduced to one shilling (£ in 2015), per day—except on Fridays, when it was set at two shillings and six pence, and on Saturdays when it remained at five shillings. The one-shilling ticket proved most successful among the industrial classes, with four and a half million shillings (£ in 2015) being taken from attendees in this manner. Two thousand five hundred tickets were printed for the opening day, all of which were bought.

To attract future customers from the working classes, the newly expanding railways offered highly discounted tickets for people to travel from distant parts of the country, and special rates were offered to parties, often led by the local vicar. Those too poor to travel lined up by the rail tracks to watch the long trains of open carriages steaming past.

== Stereoscopic views ==
The Great Exhibition of 1851 encouraged the production of souvenirs. Several manufacturers produced stereoscope cards that provided a three-dimensional view of the exhibition. These paper souvenirs were printed lithographic cards which were hand-coloured and held together by cloth to give a three-dimensional view of the event. They offered a miniature view of the Crystal Palace when one viewed the cards through the peep holes on the front cover. Visitors purchased these souvenirs so that they could relive the experience of attending.

Ancient volcanic streams, grass forests, springs, streams, and a preserved isolated pocket of semi-evergreen vines are just some of the contents of this beautiful national park.

Many species of animals have found refuge here, some permanently, and some come occasionally, like koalas. This is home to the largest cockroach in the world.

<text>Binary form is a musical form in 2 related sections, both of which are usually repeated. Binary is also a structure used to choreograph dance. In music this is usually performed as A-A-B-B.

Binary form was popular during the Baroque period, often used to structure movements of keyboard sonatas. It was also used for short, one-movement works. Around the middle of the 18th century, the form largely fell from use as the principal design of entire movements as sonata form and organic development gained prominence. When it is found in later works, it usually takes the form of the theme in a set of variations, or the Minuet, Scherzo, or Trio sections of a &quot;minuet and trio&quot; or &quot;scherzo and trio&quot; movement in a sonata, symphony, etc. Many larger forms incorporate binary structures, and many more complicated forms (such as the 18th-century sonata form) share certain characteristics with binary form.

==Structure==
A typical example of a piece in binary form has two large sections of roughly equal duration. The first will begin in a certain key, which will often, (but not always), modulate to a closely related key. Pieces in a major key will usually modulate to the dominant, (the fifth scale degree above the tonic). Pieces in a minor key will generally modulate to the relative major key, (the key of the third scale degree above the minor tonic), or to the dominant minor. A piece in minor may also stay in the original key at the end of the first section, closing with an imperfect cadence.

The second section of the piece begins in the newly established key, where it remains for an indefinite period of time. After some harmonic activity, the piece will eventually modulate back to its original key before ending.

More often than not, especially in 18th-century compositions, the A and B sections are separated by double bars with repeat signs, meaning both sections were to be repeated.

Binary form is usually characterized as having the form &quot;AB&quot;, though since both sections repeat, a more accurate description would be &quot;AABB&quot;. Others, however, prefer to use the label &quot;AA′&quot;. This second designation points to the fact that there is no great change in character between the two sections. The rhythms and melodic material used will generally be closely related in each section, and if the piece is written for a musical ensemble, the instrumentation will generally be the same. This is in contrast to the use of verse-chorus form in popular music—the contrast between the two sections is primarily one of the keys used.

==Further distinctions==
A piece in binary form can be further classified according to a number of characteristics:

===Simple vs. rounded=== 
Occasionally, the &quot;B&quot; section will end with a &quot;return&quot; of the opening material from the &quot;A&quot; section. This is referred to as rounded binary, and is labeled as &quot;ABA&quot;′. In rounded binary, the beginning of the &quot;B&quot; section is sometimes referred to as the &quot;bridge&quot;, and will usually conclude with a half cadence in the original key. Rounded binary is not to be confused with ternary form, also labeled &quot;ABA&quot;—the difference being that, in ternary form, the &quot;B&quot; section contrasts completely with the &quot;A&quot; material as in, for example, a minuet and trio. Another important difference between the rounded and ternary form is that in rounded binary, when the &quot;A&quot; section returns, it will typically contain only half of the full &quot;A&quot; section, whereas ternary form will end with the full &quot;A&quot; section.

Sometimes, as in the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti, the return of the &quot;A&quot; theme may include much of the original &quot;A&quot; section in the tonic key, so much so that some of his sonatas can be regarded as precursors of sonata form.

Rounded binary form is sometimes referred to as small ternary form.

Rounded binary or minuet form:
 A :||: B A or A&#x27;
 I(-&gt;V) :||: V(or other closely related) I

If the &quot;B&quot; section lacks such a return of the opening &quot;A&quot; material, the piece is said to be in simple binary.

Simple:
 A-&gt;B :||: A-&gt;B
 I-&gt;V :||: V-&gt;I

Slow-movement form:
 A&#x27; A&quot;
 I-&gt;V I-&gt;I

Many examples of rounded binary are found among the church sonatas of Vivaldi including his Sonata No. 1 for Cello and Continuo, First Movement, while certain Baroque composers such as Bach and Handel used the form rarely.

===Sectional vs. continuous===
If the &quot;A&quot; section ends with an authentic (or perfect) cadence in the original tonic key of the piece, the design is referred to as a sectional binary. This refers to the fact that the piece is in different tonal sections, each beginning in their own respective keys.

If the &quot;A&quot; section ends with any other kind of cadence, the design is referred to as a continuous binary. This refers to the fact that the &quot;B&quot; section will &quot;continue on&quot; with the new key established by the cadence at the end of &quot;A&quot;.

===Symmetrical vs. asymmetrical===
If the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; sections are roughly equal in length, the design is referred to as symmetrical.

If the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; sections are of unequal length, the design is referred to as asymmetrical. In such cases, the &quot;B&quot; section is usually longer than the &quot;A&quot; section.

The asymmetrical binary form becomes more common than the symmetrical type from about the time of Beethoven, and is almost routine in the main sections of Minuet and Trio or Scherzo and Trio movements in works from this period. In such cases, occasionally only the first section of the binary structure is marked to be repeated.

Although most of Chopin&#x27;s nocturnes are in an overall ternary form, quite often the individual sections (either the A, the B, or both) are in binary form, most often of the asymmetrical variety. If a section of this binary structure is repeated, in this case it is written out again in full, usually considerably varied, rather than enclosed between repeat signs.

===Balanced binary===
Balanced binary consists of ending the first and second sections with analogous cadential material (and arguably pre-cadential material). The usual pattern for balanced binary is continuous (&quot;i.e.,&quot; the first section ends off tonic), with the two sections ending in &quot;rhyming cadences&quot;, in which the same cadential material occurs in both sections, appropriately transposed for their keys. 
This differs from Rounded Binary, since in a Rounded Binary form, thematic material from the A section must return at the end of the B section (which usually occurs at the beginnings of phrases), whereas in a balanced binary, it is sufficient for a meaningful portion of the end of the final phrase to return.

For example, if the A section is a &quot;period&quot; (using Caplin&#x27;s naming conventions; elsewhere called a &quot;parallel period&quot;), the first (&quot;antecedent&quot;) phrase of the A section will begin with a &quot;basic idea&quot; (generally for one half of the phrase) and end with a relatively weak cadence, and the second (&quot;consequent&quot;) phrase will begin with the same &quot;basic idea&quot; and end with a stronger cadence; alternatively, if the A section is a &quot;sentence&quot;, the first half of the section will consist of two repetitions of the &quot;basic idea&quot; (with the second possibly transposed or slightly altered), and the rest of the phrase will drive towards a cadence. In a rounded binary form, at the end of the B section, if the A section was a &quot;sentence&quot;, typically the beginning of the sentence returns, potentially abridged, followed by the cadence; if a &quot;period&quot;, the same is true, but since the antecedent and the consequent of a period both begin the same way, it is generally simpler to say that the entire consequent phrase returns. However, in either case, it is the &quot;basic idea&quot; that returns, followed by the cadence.
In a balanced binary, the &quot;basic idea&quot; need not return. There is some room for debate concerning how much material must return preceding the cadence; it is a subjective decision upon which theorists may differ. Thus, it is not always clear how the concept of balanced binary should apply if the A section is a &quot;period&quot;. However, if the A section is a &quot;sentence&quot;, the balanced binary may bring back the entire second half of the A section (transposed if appropriate) without ever bringing back the &quot;basic idea&quot;.

There is also some room for debate concerning how the concept of balanced binary should relate to sectional binary forms. In principle, there is no intrinsic reason why a sectional binary form in which the second half of the A section (whether &quot;sentence&quot; or &quot;period&quot;) returns at the end of the B section should not be considered balanced since they end with the same cadences. From this point of view, many rounded binary forms are also balanced (especially those in which the A section is a &quot;period&quot;), but the fact that they would be balanced would be effectively uninteresting because the fact that they are rounded supersedes this characteristic. However, if one considers rhyming cadences in different keys to be a defining characteristic of balanced binary, then balanced and rounded binaries are mutually exclusive but analogous structures belonging, respectively, to continuous and sectional forms.

===Rounded vs. incipient or small ternary===
As noted above, there is some disagreement about the use of the term &quot;rounded binary&quot;. The disagreements concern two issues: whether the names &quot;rounded binary&quot;, &quot;incipient ternary&quot;, or &quot;small ternary&quot; is more appropriate to describe the form; and how much of the A section must return at the end of the B section to be considered rounded.

The principal difference between &quot;rounded binary&quot; and &quot;small ternary&quot; forms is the nature of the B section material between the A section and the return of A section material at the end of the piece. In &quot;rounded binary&quot;, this additional material is called a &quot;digression&quot;, and does not stand alone as a conclusive musical section, whereas in ternary, this material constitutes a complete musical section unto itself (albeit not necessarily ending on the tonic chord if an example of continuous ternary form).

The issue concerning how much of the A section must return to be considered &quot;rounded binary&quot; is subjective. Either the entire A section must return or only the thematic material of the A section (specifically, the &quot;basic idea&quot;) and the cadence.

Putting these ideas together, if the material between the A section and the return of the thematic material does not stand alone (a digression) and only a part of the A section returns, we do not have a ternary form, and may have a &quot;rounded binary&quot;, though not all theorist would accept this terminology (and there is some overlap here with the notion of &quot;balanced binary&quot; -- see above). If we have a digression, but also have the entire A section returning, then it might be called either &quot;rounded binary&quot; or &quot;incipient ternary&quot; (meaning, &quot;approaching ternary&quot;), depending on the theorist. If the intermediate material stands on its own as a self-sufficient section, then we have &quot;small ternary&quot; (in such cases, the entire A section usually returns).

<text>Frankland Group is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 1353 km northwest of Brisbane. The five continental islands of the Frankland Group are High Island, Normanby Island, Mabel Island, Round Island and Russell Island, which lie about 10 km offshore, and are about 45 km south east of Cairns. They are the traditional home of the Mandingalbay Yidinji, and the Gungandji Aboriginal peoples. On 9 June 1770, on the First voyage of James Cook, Cook named the island group after Admiral Sir Thomas Frankland, 5th Baronet (1718–1784).

A large number of birds are supported here, including numerous seabirds, as well as pied imperial pigeons, fruit doves, varied honeyeaters, and white-breasted woodswallows.

<doc id="103297" wikidata="Q1284505" url="?curid=103297" title="Freshwater National Park">
<text>Freshwater is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 34 km north of Brisbane. The park is west of Redcliffe, near Deception Bay, within Caboolture Shire.

The park&#x27;s vegetation is a remnant of the Open Sclerophyll Woodland which was once common in this area. The dominant trees are &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species, notably scribbly gum - &quot;Eucalyptus racemosa&quot; with smooth white trunks, and some &quot;Angophora&quot; species, while the shrub layer varies from an Open Heath area dominated by low grasstrees in the south of the park to dense &quot;Casuarina&quot; stands, and small swampy areas with paperbark trees (&quot;Melaleuca&quot; sp.). A small creek runs through the north end of the park. 
Sighted in the Open Heath area are low growing plants such as the fringed lilly &quot;Thysanotus tuberosus&quot;, tall sundew &quot;Drosera peltata&quot;, which is a carnivorous plant, flat-stemmed cord rush &quot;Eurychorda complanata&quot; and Wallum grevillea &quot;Grevillea leiophylla&quot;, which is a delicate pink flowered grevillea growing to only about 30 cm. This is only a small selection of the numerous beautiful plants to be found in this park.
This park is one of the few protected places of Open Woodland/Low Heathland in the area. Much of this type of vegetation has been cleared for development.

Though very small, and surrounded by development, roads and a highway, the park is rich with wildlife. In spring it teams with birds, most noticeable being the many species of honeyeaters. Australian fairywrens such as the beautiful blue variegated fairywren and the brilliant red and black red-backed fairywren both occur here. In a very large old gum tree wedge-tailed eagles have made a nest, and the adults are often seen soaring over the park. Calls from white-throated gerygones, spangled drongos and rainbow bee-eaters make a pleasant background sound in the park.

The invertebrate fauna is rich, with many species of dragonflies and damselflies being quite obvious in summer. The magnificent large dragonfly &quot;Hemianax papuensis&quot; hawks through the park all year long, while in summer the beautiful &quot;Rhyothemis graphiptera&quot;, with wings barred with glistening dark purple, waft slowly along the tracks, and deep red &quot;Diplacodes bipunctata&quot; males sun themselves on twigs low to the ground.

<text>Girraween National Park is an area of the Granite Belt in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia reserved as a national park. Girraween is known for its spectacular flowers, dramatic landscapes and unique wildlife. Bushwalking and rock climbing are the most popular activities in the park.

==Location==
The park is situated 40 km south of Stanthorpe. The southern boundary of the park is the state border between Queensland and New South Wales. It is a twin park with Bald Rock National Park, which lies across the border in New South Wales, and features Bald Rock, the second-largest monolith (after Uluru) on the continent. Curiously, South Bald Rock and West Bald Rock lie in Girraween National Park in Queensland, not in Bald Rock National Park in New South Wales.

==Features==

It features granite landscapes, balancing boulders, clear streams, wetlands, cascades and open forest. The granite outcroppings, such as the Pyramids and Castle Rock at 1112 m, dominate the local scenery. The park contains many kilometres of graded walking trails to the park&#x27;s major features like the First Pyramid, Second Pyramid, The Sphinx, Turtle Rock, Underground Creek, the Eye of the Needle and Mount Norman - the highest point in the park at 1267 metres. Fire trails can be followed when venturing into the southern and eastern sections of the park. The park has a temperate climate. During winter snow can fall in the area.

===Fauna and flora===
Girraween is an Aboriginal word meaning &#x27;place of flowers&#x27; and the best time to see the local flora is late in July when the Golden Wattle blooms.

The park has abundant fauna, including some that are rarely seen elsewhere in Queensland, such as the common wombat, spotted quoll, lyrebird and the turquoise parrot.

The area is also noted for its diverse flora. The eucalypt forests and heathlands provide habitat for abundant birdlife. In spring, many wildflowers bloom, this led to its being called &quot;place of flowers&quot; in the indigenous language. The area is the only place where the Wallangarra whitegums grow.

In 1992, Taronga Park Zoo staff discovered the rare Bald Rock Creek turtle. The species has only been found within a ten km stretch of the creek.

== Facilities ==
Camping facilities are provided by the Queensland Department of National Parks at Castle Rock. The site has toilets available, is suitable for caravans and has disabled access to the amenities blocks.

<text>Glass House Mountains National Park is a heritage-listed national park at Glass House Mountains, Sunshine Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. It is also known as Beerburrum Forest Reserve 1. It is north of Brisbane and consists of a flat plain punctuated by rhyolite and trachyte volcanic plugs, the cores of extinct volcanoes that formed 26 million to 27 million years ago. The mountains would once have had pyroclastic exteriors, but these have eroded away.

The national park was established in 1994. On 23 June 2010 the Queensland Government announced the expansion of the park to include an additional . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 May 2007.

==Facilities==
Camp grounds are available at Glass House Mountains township and Coochin Creek, west of Beerwah. Lookouts have been built at several of the summits. Walking tracks allow access to the summits of Mount Beerwah, Mount Tibrogargan and Mount Ngungun. Access is via the Steve Irwin Way exit from the Bruce Highway.

== History ==
The Glass House Mountains are one of southeast Queensland&#x27;s most impressive landmarks. They are situated north of Brisbane and are a group of steep sided plugs of trachyte and rhyolite, once within volcanoes active in the early Tertiary Period. They have been exposed by wind and water erosion of the softer material of the cones and surrounding area and now rise dramatically from the flat coastal plain.

The mountains are central to the creation myths of the region and their spiritual and social importance and links to Indigenous people continues to this day.

The first European description of the Glass House Mountains was by Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook, when he sailed north up the east coast of Australia on his voyage of discovery in the ship HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1770. The shape of the mountains reminded him of the huge glass furnaces (glasshouses) back in his native Yorkshire and he named them accordingly. In his log for 17 May 1770 he wrote:this place may always be found by three hills which lay to the northward of it in the latitude of 26 degrees 53 minutes south. These hills lay but a little way inland and not far from each other; they are very remarkable on account of their singular form of elevation which very much resembles glass houses which occasioned me giving them that name: the northernmost of the three is the highest and largest. There are likewise several other peaked hills inland to the northward of these but they are not nearly so remarkable.Nearly thirty years later, Lieutenant (later Captain) Matthew Flinders sailed up the coast in the sloop Norfolk. In his report to the Governor of New South Wales, Captain John Hunter, dated 14 July 1799 he wrote:At dusk Cape Moreton bore west two or three miles, and the highest glass house, whose peak was just topping over the distant land, had opened around it at 3 degrees west or 4 degrees north. Two Haycock like hummocks distinct from any other land opened soon after a few degrees to the southward.On 26 July Flinders took two sailors and the Aborigine Bungaree and landed on the shore with the intention of climbing Mount Tibrogargan. They climbed Mount Beerburrum before setting off for Tibrogargan, which they reached the next day, but which they did not climb.

On 29 November 1823 John Oxley entered observations of the Glass Houses in his field book. Allan Cunningham also mentioned them in his report of 15 July 1829.

In 1839-42 Andrew Petrie and Stephen Simpson explored the Glasshouse Mountains and in 1848 Andrew and John Petrie climbed Beerwah and left a note in a bottle at the summit. Petrie and naturalist Dr Ludwig Leichhardt visited the area in 1843 and 1844 and made geological and botanical observations.

The Glass House Mountains have been an inspiration for artists since they were first described by Cook, including the painting by Conrad Martens&#x27; &quot;Glasshouse Mountains, Moreton Bay&quot;. Numerous poems have been written about them and they have been the subjects of writings such as the short story, &quot;The Mountains Played&quot;, by Judith Wright.

The mountains have also been a popular subject for both amateur and professional photographers from the early years of photography to the present day. Recent musical works such as Robert Davidson&#x27;s &quot;Tibrogargan&quot; and John Gilfedder&#x27;s work &quot;Legend of the Tibrogargan&quot; testify to the continuing appeal of the mountains.

The proximity of the peaks to several large coastal population centres makes them destinations for tourists who participate in bushwalking, climbing and take-in the views from the mountains.

The Glass House Mountains provide islands of natural habitat for plants and animals. They conserve regionally significant areas of rhyolitic mountain vegetation that supports 26 plants that are rare, threatened or of conservation interest. The ridges, rocky pavements, scree slopes and gullies provide a variety of habitats for vegetation ranging from Eucalypt open forest to montane heaths and shrublands. The mountains also provide a habitat for many species of fauna, some of which are rare or endangered. The area now known as the Glass House Mountains National Park was first gazetted in 1954. Gazetted areas incorporated smaller parks such as Beerwah, Coonowrin, Ngungun and Tibrogargan. These smaller parks were amalgamated into the Glass House Mountains National Park in 1994.

== Description ==

The Glass House Mountains are a group of dome shaped hills and conical peaks rising sharply above the surrounding sub-coastal lowlands. They are the remnants of rhyolite and trachyte volcanic plugs and are located in southeast Queensland north of Brisbane and west of the townships of Glass House Mountains and Beerburrum.

Glass House Mountains National Park and Beerburrum Forest Reserve 1 covers eleven of the 16 Glass House Mountains and a small parcel of land known as Blue Gum Creek. The park is in eight sections ranging in size from and in total cover an area of approximately .

Mount Tibrogargan () and Mount Cooee () are composed of alkali rhyolite. Mount Cooee has caves and there are the remains of an old trigonometry station at the summit. It is a habitat for the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Mount Tibrogargan is the third highest and is open for the public to climb.

Mount Beerwah () is composed of alkali trachyte. Near the top, there are large hexagonal cooling columns on its north side (the Organ Pipes). The mountain also has early timber trails and timber getters&#x27; campsites on the eastern side. It has caves and is also a peregrine falcon habitat. Mount Beerwah is the highest peak within the park; however public access to the &quot;tourist track&quot; in the National Park has been restricted since 2009.

Mount Ngungun () is composed of alkali rhyolite. This mountain also has good examples of vertical columnar jointing and has caves. There is evidence of early 1950s quarrying activities.

Mount Coonowrin (Crookneck) () is composed of alkali rhyolite. It has good examples of vertical columnar jointing and has caves. Timber and steel pitons left by climbers can be found, though the mountain is now closed to climbers. It is a habitat for the peregrine falcon. Mount Coonowrin is the second highest; however, public access to it has been prohibited since 1999 due to the danger of trachyte rock stability.

Mount Elimbah () is locally called Saddleback because of the saddle like dip between the peaks. It is composed of alkali rhyolite and right-angled trenches used for World War Two infantry training can be seen on the lower slopes

Blue Gum Creek is an area of about . It supports populations of the endangered swamp stringbark Eucalyptus conglomerata. It is an isolated species habitat for several vulnerable species of frogs including wallum froglet Crinia tinnula, wallum sedge frog Litoria olongburensis and Freycinet&#x27;s frog Litoria freycineti and the rare green thighed frog Litoria brevipalmata.

Mount Miketeebumulgrai () is composed of porphyritic trachyte and provides feeding and nesting places for the black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami) and the rare grey goshawk (&quot;Accipiter novaehollandiae&quot;).

Mount Coochin, (as known as Coochin Hills) - west hill , east hill , is composed of alkali rhyolite and supports an area of the endangered plant species Leucopogon recurvisepalus.

Mount Beerburrum () is composed of porphyritic trachyte. The mountain has complex rainforest, with some endangered plant species such as Tindal&#x27;s stringybark (Eucalyptus tindaliae), Pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia) and Smooth-barked apple (Angophora leiocarpa). Scribbly gum (Eucalyptus racemosa) is locally predominant in places, with the largest tract retained on Mount Beerburrum. The mountain has a forestry fire tower with a viewing platform at the summit.

Mount Tunbubudla, also known as the Twins (west twin , east twin ), is composed of alkali rhyolite. The majority of the mountain is covered in dry sclerophyll forest. There are also areas of exposed rock dominated by the rare Bronze-barked Tea Tree (Leptospermum luehmannii), a plant restricted to the Glasshouse Mountains.

Mount Tibberoowuccum () is composed of alkali rhyolite. The mountain is a dome-shaped rock surrounded by eucalypt open forest, as well as complex rainforest, although the area is not extensive. There is a small population of Narrow-leaf bitter-pea (Daviesia Mimosoides) present on the southern slope of the mountain. This shrub is widespread in Victoria and New South Wales, but rare in Queensland, and the Mount Tiberoocwuccum population is the most northerly known.

Other peaks include: 
* Round Mountain
* Wild Horse Mountain, 

=== Flora ===
The peaks support a diverse range of habitats including montane heath and shrubland, open forest and woodlands and small rainforest patches on some peaks.The montane heath is particularly rich in threatened and endemic species many of which can be found nowhere else. In total there are 26 species of rare vegetation on the heaths. The Glasshouse Mountains Tea Tree (Leptospermum leuhmanii) is restricted to the peaks and is notable for its beautiful smooth orange bark. The Mount Beerwah Mallee Red Gum (Eucalyptus kabiana) is also endemic and is named after the local Aboriginal Tribe and traditional owners the Kabi Kabi (pronounced Gubbi Gubbi). Other endemic plants include Gonocarpus effusus, Grevillea hodgei, Westringia grandifolia and Leptospermum oreophyllum.

== Heritage listing ==
Glass House Mountains National Park and Beerburrum Forest Reserve 1 was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 May 2007 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland&#x27;s history.

The Glass House Mountains as ancient landforms illustrate the evolution of the landscape and the geological history of volcanic activity in the area. Because of their size and distinctive form they are readily identifiable from a number of distant observation points from both land and sea and so have played an important role in navigation in connection with the European exploration of the east coast of Australia. Captain Cook sighted and named them in 1770. In 1799 Matthew Flinders also reported on the Glass House peaks and camped in the area. Other early explorers connected with them are John Oxley, Alan Cunningham, Andrew Petrie and Ludwig Leichhardt.

The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

The Glass House peaks are visually impressive, rising dramatically from a flat coastal plain and are landmarks that can be seen from as far away as the Scenic Rim on the Queensland and New South border and out to sea. Views of the mountains, and obtained from the mountains, are of high aesthetic value and have inspired countless paintings and photographs. Their majestic and eerie beauty continues to attract large numbers of visitors to the national park areas that contain them.

The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland&#x27;s history.

The Glass House peaks are central to the creation myths of the region and have a high degree of cultural significance to Indigenous people.

The wider community also values the mountains as recreational venues and their closeness to Brisbane and major centres on the Sunshine Coast have made them readily accessible to day-trippers. The peaks have for many years been popular destinations for people wanting to bushwalk, picnic and to enjoy the volcanic scenery.

<text>Gloucester Island is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 950 km northwest of Brisbane. It is visible from the town of Bowen. The island was seen and erroneously named &quot;Cape Gloucester&quot; by British explorer James Cook in 1770. The name &quot;Cape Gloucester&quot; has been used informally for areas on or near Gloucester Island. 

Bird watching is topical from October to April, when thousands of migrating birds can be seen, especially waders. The average altitude of the terrain is 34 metres.

<doc id="103304" wikidata="Q958913" url="?curid=103304" title="Goold Island National Park">
<text>Goold Island is a national park in Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane. The island is close to the northern tip of Hinchinbrook Island off the coast from Cardwell in Rockingham Bay and is part of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.

Covering the island is located from shore. It is covered mostly with open eucalypt forest, rainforested gullies and semi permanent creek water.

==History==

For many thousands of years before non-indigenous peoples arrived in the region, Goold, neighbouring islands, and surrounding seas were occupied, used, and enjoyed by generations of the Bandjin peoples&#x27; ancestors, leaving behind an array of stone fish traps and shell middens which can still be found on and around the island to this day.

Bandjin survivors of an often violent non-indigenous &#x27;occupation&#x27; of the region continue to value and consider Goold Island as part of their sea country, and, in December 2005, they included Goold Island within Australia&#x27;s and Queensland&#x27;s first accredited &#x27;Traditional Use of Marine Resource Agreement&#x27;.

==Camping==

Campers are required to bring their own water and all camping equipment. Camping is by permit only and is limited numbers so it is best to book in advance. Access to the islands is by ferry, private boat or charter or sea kayak. Marine stingers are present during the warmer months.

==Neighbouring Islands==
The nearby Brook Islands are smaller and made up of North, Tween, Middle and South islands, the first three of which comprise the Brook Islands National Park. These islands are used mainly by nesting birds. It is important not to disturb the birds during breeding seasons. Birds found here include the Torresian imperial-pigeon (estimated at over 40,000), bridled terns, black-naped terns, roseate terns and little terns. The beach stone-curlew also makes North Brook Island its home.

<text>Great Basalt Wall is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 1124 km northwest of Brisbane. This national park protects 35,200 ha of land containing the Great Basalt Wall, a geological formation of the Toomba flow. The Toomba volcano erupted approximately 20,000 years ago, covered 670 square kilometres, and flowed for 120 km. It is one of the most recent volcanic eruptions in Queensland. Due to the viscous nature of the rocky lava flows the park is not accessible to the public.

249 animal species inhabit the park. The elevation of the terrain is 498 metres.

<doc id="103306" wikidata="Q1422878" url="?curid=103306" title="Great Sandy National Park">
<text>Great Sandy National Park is a coastal national park in the Fraser Coast Region, Queensland, Australia.

==Geography==
The park features untouched beaches, large sand dunes, heathlands, rainforests, swamps, creeks, freshwater lakes and mangrove forests.

Great Sandy National Park is divided into two sections. The Cooloola Recreation Area section is situated on the coast between Noosa Heads in the south and Rainbow Beach in the north and covers . The K&#x27;Gari section (formerly known as Fraser Island) encompasses almost all of the world&#x27;s largest sand island, which is situated north of Rainbow Beach, covering .

== Environment ==

=== Birds ===
The land within the park is classified by BirdLife International as the Cooloola and Fraser Coast Important Bird Area because it supports a large population of black-breasted buttonquails as well as many bush and beach stone-curlews, green catbirds, regent bowerbirds, mangrove honeyeaters, and pale-yellow robins. Cooloola is also home to the eastern ground parrot and has one of the last coastal populations of the emu.
== Features ==
The Cooloola section contains the Cooloola Great Walk, a five-day hiking trail. Boat tours and canoeing along the Noosa River are popular visitor activities. On Fraser Island is the 90 km long Fraser Island Great Walk.
Lake Cootharaba offers fishing, sailing, and canoeing opportunities.

Whale watching, fishing, four-wheel driving, and bushwalking are also popular. The park also features two shipwrecks; the SS &quot;Maheno&quot; and the &quot;Cherry Venture&quot;.

The only place in the world where tall rainforest grows in sand is on K&#x27;Gari (formerly known as Fraser Island). The sand island has coloured sand cliffs on its eastern beach and numerous walking tracks from short boardwalks to longer walks, which cross sand blows.

K&#x27;Gari also has more than 100 freshwater lakes including the largest perched lake in the world, Lake Boomanjin. Lake Wabby is a popular swimming and fishing spot.

A unique feature of Great Sandy National Park is the coloured sands, which are formed by old sand mixed with clay into a consolidated mass. The visible hues include red, brown, and yellow, which are a reflection of the iron-rich minerals embedded in the sands for thousands of years and brought to the surface by wind and water eroding the land.

== Access ==
Access to Fraser Island ideally requires a high-clearance 4WD vehicle. Parts of the Cooloola section are also inaccessible without a four-wheel drive. Vehicles entering the park need to obtain a vehicle permit for both Fraser Island and the Cooloola Recreational Area. Both sections have numerous camping areas.

=== Camping ===
Permits are required to camp in the park. About 15 camp sites are in the Cooloola section. Only electric motors and non-motorised vessels are permitted past Campsite 3.

=== Fines ===
Fines are issued for feeding Fraser Island&#x27;s wild dingo population or leaving food or rubbish that may attract them.

<doc id="103307" wikidata="Q1544549" url="?curid=103307" title="Green Island National Park">
<text>Green Island National Park is a protected area declared over a small (12 ha) coral cay of Green Island, Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia. It is known to the local Gungganyji Aboriginal peoples as &quot;Dabuukji&quot;. The Gungganyji people used the island as an initiation ground.

It is 27 km offshore from Cairns (1394 km northwest of Brisbane), Queensland, can be accessed by a choice of boats leaving daily from Cairns, and is reputed to be the most visited (popular) island National Park within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.

== Park features ==
Green Island is a true coral cay formed over thousands of years by the build-up of sand and coral rubble deposited on the calm side of a platform reef. The island is covered in tropical vine forest which supports a diversity of birds and insects. The surrounding coral reef is home to many kinds of corals, clams, fish, stingrays and other reef life. Green and hawksbill turtles are seen offshore. More than 60 species of bird are found on the island. While exploring the east coast in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook recorded on his chart &quot;a low green woody island&quot; and named the island after his ship&#x27;s astronomer, Charles Green. In 1857, the first of many beche-de-mer fishing stations was established on the island. In 1928, the first regular ferry service began in the region. 

Green Island has been a popular tourist resort for more than a century. The island became a national park in 1937, a marine park in 1974 and part of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area in 1981. Today the island, reef and beaches are managed together as a recreation area.

Camping on the island is not permitted. A small luxury resort is built on the island with daily ferry services providing access.

<text>Holbourne Island National Park is a national park in Queensland (Australia), northwest of Brisbane.

== History ==

Holbourne Island became well known in 1875, when 18 survivors of the shipwreck reached its shores. Four survivors arrived on a damaged port lifeboat on 25 February, where they survived by eating raw bird&#x27;s eggs and drinking rain water that had pooled in the island rocks. The following day, 14 survivors from a starboard lifeboat also landed. Because rescue was uncertain, the survivors engraved their names on the side of a large turtle shell, which is displayed in the South Australian Museum, on North Terrace in Adelaide.

On 28 February, 15 of them set off in the starboard lifeboat for an island about away to the south, which seemed to be more in the track of ships. A rescue ship sent looking for survivors of &quot;Gothenburg&quot;, picked up the group and took them safely to Bowen. The ship subsequently returned to Holbourne Island and rescued the three remaining survivors.

== Present day ==

As well as being a national park, Holbourne Island is well known as a natural bird sanctuary and turtle nesting area.

On 2 September 2001, the 50,000 gross ton bulk carrier &quot;Pax Phoenix&quot; departed Hay Point, Queensland bound for India via Singapore. While passing Holbourne Island, an oil slick was noticed and described as being in width. Although there were concerns about the effect on the island and wildlife, it eventually dispersed naturally out to sea without impact.

Holbourne Island is often referred to as part of the Coral Sea&#x27;s Bermuda Triangle, as several maritime mysteries are linked to the area.

<doc id="103317" wikidata="Q240098" url="?curid=103317" title="Ileana Cotrubaș">
<text>Ileana Cotrubaș (; born 9 June 1939) is a Romanian operatic soprano whose career spanned from the 1960s to the 1980s. She was much admired for her acting skills and facility for singing opera in many different languages.

==Life and career==

Cotrubaș was born in Galați. She grew up in a musical family; her father, Vasile, was a tenor in an amateur choir. Cotrubaș&#x27; musical career began at the age of nine when she became a member of a children&#x27;s radio choir. By the age of eleven, she was one of its leading soloists. In 1952, she moved to Bucharest to study at the &quot;Școala Specială de Muzică&quot; school for the musically gifted. Cotrubaș made her stage debut with the Bucharest Opera as Yniold in Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; in 1964. She subsequently expanded her repertory to include roles such as Oscar in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, and Blonde in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; and began appearing in productions throughout Europe.

In 1965, Cotrubaș won the International Vocal Competition &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in Netherlands, where she won first prize in opera, lieder, and oratorio. The following year, she won the ARD International Music Competition in Munich. Those awards, together with her great success in the role of Pamina in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; in Brussels, led to appearances in the Vienna State Opera, Hamburg State Opera, Berlin State Opera and Salzburg Festival, and to a contract with the Oper Frankfurt in 1968.

In 1969, she made her UK debut at the Glyndebourne Festival as Mélisande, and sang two succeeding seasons there in the title role of Cavalli&#x27;s &quot;La Calisto&quot;. She made her début at the Royal Opera House in London in 1971 as Tatyana in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. Cotrubaș signed a three-year contract with the Vienna State Opera in 1970. During her time there, she learned the roles of Susanna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, Zerlina in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, Mimì in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, and Sophie in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; by Richard Strauss.

In 1973, she made her American operatic debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Mimì, and at Glyndebourne sang Susanna opposite the Figaro of Knut Skram. Cotrubaș made her international breakthrough on 7 January 1975, when she replaced Mirella Freni at La Scala as Mimì. She had to fly from her home in Kent and arrived 15 minutes before curtain time. Her interpretation was acclaimed by critics and audiences alike.

Cotrubaș made her Metropolitan Opera debut on 23 March 1977, as Mimì in a production with José Carreras and Renata Scotto. While with the Met, she appeared as Gilda, opposite Plácido Domingo and Cornell MacNeil, in a televised performance of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; on 7 November 1977, and as Violetta, again opposite Domingo and MacNeil, in a televised performance of &quot;La traviata&quot; on 28 March 1981. She sang three other roles at the Met: Ilia in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; (in its Metropolitan Opera premiere), Tatyana, and Micaëla in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, the role of her final performance with the company on 26 March 1987.

Cotrubaș is known for being very demanding of directors and colleagues. On several occasions—&quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; in Vienna in 1973 and &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; at the Met in 1980—she walked out of productions when she disagreed with the stage director. She retired from public singing in 1990, but continued to teach, giving master classes and coaching promising young singers, including Elena Tsallagova.

<text>Hope Islands National Park is a national park in Queensland (Australia) 1,521 km north-west of Brisbane. The park consists of four islands: East Hope and West Hope, Snapper Island and Struck Island. 

The Hope Islands are situated approximately 37 km south-east of Cooktown and about 8 km offshore () and officially part of the mainland locality of Rossville.

Struck Island is a rocky outcrop just off Thornton Beach and south of Cape Tribulation.

Snapper island is about two km long and is at the mouth of the Daintree River. It is about 20 km north of Port Douglas.

Access is via private vessel or by permitted commercial operators.

The Hope islands were named by Lt James Cook on 13 June 1770, after his ship &quot;HMS Endeavour&quot; narrowly escaped sinking after running aground on the eastern part of Endeavour Reef at 11pm on 11 June. Cook writes of taking a risk and sailing from the reef on the morning of 13 June in favourable conditions but the three operational bilge pumps could not keep up with the flow of water. Cook wrote &quot;we were always in hopes of being able to reach these Islands&quot;. Cook speaks of he and the crew thinking the situation so dire that the best scenario would be to ground the boat on the reef surrounding the islands if the mainland could not be reached. They aimed to build a vessel from the wreck to make it back to the East Indies. However, some crew members were able to &quot;&quot; the leak using a sail so that the water could be cleared easily using one bilge pump. Endeavour was able to be sailed safely to what is now Cooktown so that repairs could be undertaken.

<text>Hull River is a national park in Queensland (Australia), 1275 km northwest of Brisbane. GIS mapping data from Queensland Department of Natural Resources (2002) showed an area of 3,240 hectares, of which about 2,100 hectares are estuarine mangroves, with the remainder being swamp forests dominated by Melaleuca and specialist Eucalypt species.
Rainfall averages 3,600 mm per year. The park is part of the Coastal Wet Tropics Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of lowland tropical rainforest birds.

The former Hull River Aboriginal Settlement was located in this park.

Hull River is a habitat for 267 species of animals and 522 species of plants. The average elevation of the terrain is 32 metres.

<text>Sir Hans Sloane, 1st Baronet, (16 April 1660 – 11 January 1753), was an Anglo-Irish physician, naturalist, and collector. He had a collection of 71,000 items which he bequeathed to the British nation, thus providing the foundation of the British Museum, the British Library, and the Natural History Museum, London.

Elected to the Royal Society at the age of 24, Sloane travelled to the Caribbean in 1687 and documented his travels and findings with extensive publications years later. Sloane was a renowned medical doctor among the aristocracy, and was elected to the Royal College of Physicians at age 27. Though he is credited with the invention of chocolate milk, it is more likely that he learned the practice of adding milk to drinking chocolate while living and working in Jamaica. Streets and places were later named after him, including Hans Place, Hans Crescent, and Sloane Square in and around Chelsea, London—the area of his final residence—and also Sir Hans Sloane Square in Killyleagh, his birthplace in Ulster.

Sloane&#x27;s London estate was bequeathed to his daughter, Elizabeth, who was married to Charles Cadogan, 2nd Baron Cadogan, in which family the estate remains.

== Early life and family ==
Sloane was born into an Anglo-Irish family on 16 April 1660 at Killyleagh, a village on the south-western shores of Strangford Lough in County Down in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. Hans Sloane was the seventh and last child of Alexander Sloane who died when Hans was six years old. Alexander Sloane was a collector general of taxes for County Down and was an agent for the 1st Earl of Clanbrassil (of the first creation; &quot;c.&quot; 1618–1659), and was a brother to James Sloane, MP (1655–1704). It is said that Sarah Hicks (Hans&#x27;s mother) was an English woman who moved to Killyleagh as Anne Carey&#x27;s companion when Anne married Lord Clanbrassil. Sloane&#x27;s paternal family were Ulster-Scots, having migrated from Ayrshire in the south-west of Scotland; they settled in east Ulster during the Plantation of Antrim and Down, which was slightly separate from the wider Plantation of Ulster, under King James VI and I. The Sloane children, including Hans, were taken up by the Hamilton family and had much of their early tuition conducted within the Killyleagh Castle library. Out of Alexander&#x27;s sons, only three reached adulthood: Hans, William, and James. The graveyards of Henry and John Sloane can be found in Killyleagh&#x27;s parish courtyard; both brothers died in their childhood. The eldest brother James was elected a Member of Parliament for Roscommon and Killyleagh in 1692. John Sloane later became an MP of Thetford and a barrister of the Inner Temple, spending most of his time in London.

Like many other Scots &#x27;Planters&#x27; in Ulster during the seventeenth-century, the Sloane name was almost certainly of Gaelic origin, Sloane probably being an anglicisation of &quot;Ó Sluagháin&quot;.

As a youth, Sloane collected objects of natural history and other curiosities. This led him to the study of medicine, which he did in London, where he studied botany, &quot;materia medica&quot;, surgery and pharmacy. His collecting habits made him useful to John Ray and Robert Boyle. After four years in London he travelled through France, spending some time at Paris and Montpellier, and stayed long enough at the University of Orange-Nassau to take his MD degree there in 1683; he was hired as an assistant to prominent physician Thomas Sydenham who gave the young man valuable introductions to practice. He returned to London with a considerable collection of plants and other curiosities, of which the former were sent to Ray and utilised by him for his &quot;History of Plants&quot;.

== Voyage to the Caribbean and the creation of chocolate milk ==

Sloane was elected to the Royal Society in 1685. In 1687, he became a fellow of the College of Physicians, and the same year went to Jamaica aboard as personal physician to the new Governor of Jamaica, the 2nd Duke of Albemarle. Albemarle died in Jamaica the next year, 1688, so Sloane&#x27;s visit lasted only fifteen months.

During his time in the Caribbean, Sloane visited several islands and collected more than 1,000 plant specimens as well as large supplies of cacao and Peruvian bark from which he later extracted quinine to treat eye ailments. Sloane noted about 800 new species of plants, which he catalogued in Latin in his &quot;Catalogus Plantarum Quae in Insula Jamaica Sponte Proveniunt&quot; (Catalogue of Jamaican Plants), published in 1696. His first writings about his trip appeared in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, in which Sloane described Jamaican plants such as the Pepper Tree and the coffee-shrub, alongside accounts of the earthquakes that struck Lima in 1687 and Jamaica in 1687/1688 and 1692. In Sloane&#x27;s work, &quot;Natural History of Jamaica&quot;, he describes for the Queen of England the Black ethnomusic of Jamaica. With the help of a local musician, he included the musical score and words of festival songs.

Sloane married Elizabeth Langley Rose, the widow of Fulke Rose of Jamaica, and daughter of Alderman John Langley, a wealthy heiress of sugar plantations in Jamaica worked by slaves. The couple had three daughters, Mary, Sarah and Elizabeth, and one son, Hans; only Sarah and Elizabeth survived infancy. Sarah married George Stanley of Paultons and Elizabeth married Charles Cadogan, who became 2nd Baron Cadogan. Once back in Britain, income from Sloane&#x27;s career as a physician and his London property investments, coupled with Elizabeth&#x27;s inheritance, enabled Sloane to build his substantial collection of natural history artefacts in the following decades. Sloane additionally had investments in the Royal African and South Sea Companies, both of which traded in slaves.

The Natural History Museum lists Sloane as the inventor of drinking chocolate with milk. However, according to historian James Delbourgo, the Jamaicans were brewing &quot;a hot beverage brewed from shavings of freshly harvested cacao, boiled with milk and cinnamon&quot; as far back as 1494. Sloane encountered the cocoa bean while he was in Jamaica, where the local people drank it mixed with water, though he is reported to have found it nauseating. Many recipes for mixing chocolate with spice, eggs, sugar and milk were in circulation by the seventeenth century. Sloane may have devised his own recipe for mixing chocolate with milk, though if so, he was probably not the first. (Some sources credit Daniel Peter as the inventor in 1875, using condensed milk; other sources point out that milk was added to chocolate centuries earlier in some countries.) By the 1750s, a Soho grocer named Nicholas Sanders claimed to be selling Sloane&#x27;s recipe as a medicinal elixir, perhaps making &quot;Sir Hans Sloane&#x27;s Milk Chocolate&quot; the first brand-name milk chocolate drink. By the nineteenth century, the Cadbury Brothers sold tins of drinking chocolate whose trade cards also invoked Sloane&#x27;s recipe.

In 1707 Sloane listed the variety of punishments inflicted on slaves in Jamaica. For rebellion, slaves were usually punished &quot;by nailing them down to the ground ... and then applying the fire by degrees from the feet and hands, burning them gradually up to the head, whereby their pains are extravagant.&quot; For lesser crimes, castration or mutilation (&quot;chopping off half the foot&quot;) was the norm. And as for negligence, slaves &quot;are usually whipt ... after they are whipt until they are raw, some put on their skins pepper and salt to make them smart; at other times their masters will drip melted wax on their skins, and use very exquisite torments.&quot;

== Society physician ==
Sloane started his own practice in 1689 at 3 Bloomsbury Place, London, Sloane worked among the upper classes where he was viewed as fashionable; he built a large practice which became lucrative. The physician served three successive sovereigns: Queen Anne, George I, and George II.

There was some criticism of Sloane during his lifetime as a mere &quot;virtuoso&quot;, an undiscriminating collector who lacked understanding of scientific principles. One critic stated that he was merely interested in the collection of knick-knacks, and another called him the &quot;foremost toyman of his time&quot;. Sir Isaac Newton described Sloane as &quot;a villain and rascal&quot; and &quot;a very tricking fellow&quot;. Some believed that his true achievement was in making friends in high society and with important political figures, rather than in science. Even as a physician, he did not get a great deal of respect from many, being seen as primarily a seller of medications and a collector of curios. Sloane&#x27;s only medical publication, an &quot;Account of a Medicine for Soreness, Weakness and other Distempers of the Eyes&quot; (London, 1745), was not published until its author was in his eighty-fifth year and had retired from practice.
In 1716 Sloane was created a baronet, making him the first medical practitioner to receive a hereditary title. In 1719 he became president of the Royal College of Physicians, holding the office for sixteen years. In 1722 he was appointed physician-general to the army, and in 1727 first physician to George II.

He was elected president of Royal College of Physicians in 1719 and served in that role until 1735. He became secretary to the Royal Society in 1693, and edited its &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; for twenty years. In 1727 he succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as president. He retired from the Society at the age of eighty.

Sloane&#x27;s role as First Secretary and later President of the Royal Society, a period which included his revitalising editorship of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, permitted Sloane little time for progressing his own scientific research, which led to the criticism of Sloane as a mere &quot;virtuoso&quot;.

Aside from his service as Royal Physician, Sloane&#x27;s true achievement during his time at the Royal Society was in acting as a conduit between the worlds of science, politics and high society.

Sloane&#x27;s time in France at the beginning of his career later enabled him to fulfil the role of intermediary between British and French scientists, fostering the sharing of knowledge between the two countries at the height of the Age of Enlightenment. Notables from that period who visited Sloane to view his collection include the Swiss anatomist Albrecht von Haller, Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin and Carl Linnaeus.

In 1745, at the age of eighty-five, and after having retired from medical practice, Sloane published his first medical work, &quot;Account of a Medicine for Soreness, Weakness and other Distempers of the Eyes&quot; (London, 1745).

During his life, Sloane was a correspondent of the French Académie Royale des Sciences and was named foreign associate in 1709, in addition to being a foreign member of the academies of science in Prussia, Saint Petersburg, Madrid and Göttingen.

===Charity work===
Sloane helped out at Christ&#x27;s Hospital from 1694 to 1730 and donated his salary back to that institution. He also supported the Royal College of Physicians&#x27; dispensary of inexpensive medications and operated a free surgery every morning.

He was a founding governor of London&#x27;s Foundling Hospital, the nation&#x27;s first institution to care for abandoned children. Inoculation was required for all children in its care; Sloane was one of the physicians of that era who promoted inoculation as a method to prevent smallpox, using it on his own family and promoting it to the royal family. He had been introduced to the concept of inoculation by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in the court of Queen Caroline.

== The British Museum and Chelsea Physic Garden ==

Sloane&#x27;s purchase of the manor of Chelsea, London, in 1712, provided the grounds for the Chelsea Physic Garden.

Over his lifetime, Sloane collected over 71,000 objects: books, manuscripts, drawings, coins and medals, plant specimens and others. His great stroke as a collector was to acquire in 1702 (by bequest, conditional on paying of certain debts) the cabinet of curiosities owned by William Courten, who had made collecting the business of his life.

When Sloane retired in 1741, his library and cabinet of curiosities, which he took with him from Bloomsbury to his house in Chelsea, had grown to be of unique value. He had acquired the extensive natural history collections of William Courten, Cardinal Filippo Antonio Gualterio, James Petiver, Nehemiah Grew, Leonard Plukenet, the Duchess of Beaufort, Adam Buddle, Paul Hermann, Franz Kiggelaer and Herman Boerhaave.

==Death and legacy==
In his final year, Sir Hans Sloane suffered from a disorder with some paralysis. He died on the afternoon of 11 January 1753 at the Manor House, Chelsea, and was buried on 18 January in the south-east corner of the churchyard at Chelsea Old Church with a memorial inscribed as follows:To the memory of SIR HANS SLOANE BART President of the Royal Society, and of the College of Physicians; who in the year of our Lord 1753, the 92d of his age, without the least pain of body and with a conscious serenity of mind, ended a virtuous and beneficent life. This monument was erected by his two daughters ELIZA CADOGAN and SARAH STANLEY

His grave is shared with his wife Elisabeth, who died on 17 September 1724.

On his death he bequeathed his books, manuscripts, prints, drawings, flora, fauna, medals, coins, seals, cameos and other curiosities to the nation, on condition that Parliament should pay his executors for a sum of £20,000 () to be paid to his heirs—intentionally far less than the estimated value of the artefacts, contemporarily estimated at £50,000 () or more according to some sources, and up to £80,000 () or more by others. The bequest was accepted on those terms by an act passed the same year, and the collection, together with George II&#x27;s royal library, and other objects. A significant proportion of this collection was later to become the foundation for the Natural History Museum. When Sloane wrote his will not only did he say he wanted to sell his work to the Parliament for 20,000 pounds, he also stated that he wanted his work to be seen by anyone who wanted to see it. The Curators thought that only scholars and the upper class were allowed to see the collection. They weren&#x27;t comfortable with the idea that the lower class was able to come to the museum and look at the collection because they didn&#x27;t think that lower class citizens were worthy. The Curators believed that learning was a privilege that only the upper class had.

He also gave the Society of Apothecaries the land of the Chelsea Physic Garden which they had rented from the Chelsea estate since 1673.

A life-size statue of Sloane was erected in the town square of Killyleagh, the town in which he was born.

===Controversy===
In August 2020, a bust of Sloane in the British Museum&#x27;s Enlightenment Gallery was moved by the museum. The decision came as part of that year&#x27;s wave of removals of monuments to those who had benefited from slavery. &quot;History Ireland&quot; contributor Tony Canavan, writing of the decision and observing the fact that the Sloane family had moved to Ireland from Scotland during the Plantation of Ulster (or, more correctly, during the Plantation of Antrim and Down), noted that &quot;the fact that Sloane came from a Scots-Irish family who benefited from a different kind of plantation, following the expulsion of natives and the confiscation of their land, [which seemed] never to have been an issue&quot;.

===Places named after Sloane===

Sloane Square, Sloane Street, Sloane Avenue, Sloane Grammar School and Sloane Gardens in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea are named after Sloane. His first name is given to Hans Street, Hans Crescent, Hans Place and Hans Road, all of which are also situated in the Royal Borough.

=== Plants and animals named after Sloane ===
* &quot;Sloanea&quot;, a plant genus, was named after him by Linnaeus.
* &quot;Urania sloanus&quot;, a species of moth.
* &quot;Spondylurus sloanii&quot;, a species of lizard, was named in his honour by Daudin.
* &quot;Chauliodus sloani&quot;, a species of deep sea fish found across the world.

<doc id="103324" wikidata="Q407688" url="?curid=103324" title="Hemocyanin">
<text>Hemocyanins (also spelled haemocyanins and abbreviated Hc) are proteins that transport oxygen throughout the bodies of some invertebrate animals. These metalloproteins contain two copper atoms that reversibly bind a single oxygen molecule (O2). They are second only to hemoglobin in frequency of use as an oxygen transport molecule. Unlike the hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates, hemocyanins are not confined in blood cells, but are instead suspended directly in the hemolymph. Oxygenation causes a color change between the colorless Cu(I) deoxygenated form and the blue Cu(II) oxygenated form.

== Species distribution ==
Hemocyanin was first discovered in &quot;Octopus vulgaris&quot; by Leon Fredericq in 1878. The presence of copper in molluscs was detected even earlier by Bartolomeo Bizio in 1833. Hemocyanins are found in the Mollusca and Arthropoda, including cephalopods and crustaceans, and utilized by some land arthropods such as the tarantula &quot;Eurypelma californicum&quot;, the emperor scorpion, and the centipede &quot;Scutigera coleoptrata&quot;. Also, larval storage proteins in many insects appear to be derived from hemocyanins.

== The hemocyanin superfamily ==
The arthropod hemocyanin superfamily is composed of phenoloxidases, hexamerins, pseudohemocyanins or cryptocyanins, and (dipteran) hexamerin receptors.

Phenoloxidase are copper containing tyrosinases. These proteins are involved in the process of sclerotization of arthropod cuticle, in wound healing, and humoral immune defense. Phenoloxidase is synthesized by zymogens and are activated by cleaving an N-terminal peptide.

Hexamerins are storage proteins commonly found in insects. These proteins are synthesized by the larval fat body and are associated with molting cycles or nutritional conditions.

Pseudohemocyanin and cryptocyanins genetic sequences are closely related to hemocyanins in crustaceans. These proteins have a similar structure and function, but lack the copper binding sites.

The evolutionary changes within the phylogeny of the hemocyanin superfamily are closely related to the emergence of these different proteins in various species. The proteins within this superfamily would not be well understood without the extensive studies of hemocyanin in arthropods.

== Structure and mechanism ==

Although the respiratory function of hemocyanin is similar to that of hemoglobin, there are a significant number of differences in its molecular structure and mechanism. Whereas hemoglobin carries its iron atoms in porphyrin rings (heme groups), the copper atoms of hemocyanin are bound as prosthetic groups coordinated by histidine residues. Each hemocyanin monomer holds a pair of copper(I) cations in place via interactions with the imidazole rings of six histidine residues. It has been noted that species using hemocyanin for oxygen transportation include crustaceans living in cold environments with low oxygen pressure. Under these circumstances hemoglobin oxygen transportation is less efficient than hemocyanin oxygen transportation. Nevertheless, there are also terrestrial arthropods using hemocyanin, notably spiders and scorpions, that live in warm climates. The molecule is conformationally stable and fully functioning at temperatures up to 90 degrees C.

Most hemocyanins bind with oxygen non-cooperatively and are roughly one-fourth as efficient as hemoglobin at transporting oxygen per amount of blood. Hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively due to steric conformation changes in the protein complex, which increases hemoglobin&#x27;s affinity for oxygen when partially oxygenated. In some hemocyanins of horseshoe crabs and some other species of arthropods, cooperative binding is observed, with Hill coefficients of 1.6–3.0. Hill coefficients vary depending on species and laboratory measurement settings. Hemoglobin, for comparison, has a Hill coefficient of usually 2.8–3.0. In these cases of cooperative binding hemocyanin was arranged in protein sub-complexes of 6 subunits (hexamer) each with one oxygen binding site; binding of oxygen on one unit in the complex would increase the affinity of the neighboring units. Each hexamer complex was arranged together to form a larger complex of dozens of hexamers. In one study, cooperative binding was found to be dependent on hexamers being arranged together in the larger complex, suggesting cooperative binding between hexamers. Hemocyanin oxygen-binding profile is also affected by dissolved salt ion levels and pH.

Hemocyanin is made of many individual subunit proteins, each of which contains two copper atoms and can bind one oxygen molecule (O2). Each subunit weighs about 75 kilodaltons (kDa). Subunits may be arranged in dimers or hexamers depending on species; the dimer or hexamer complex is likewise arranged in chains or clusters with weights exceeding 1500 kDa. The subunits are usually , or heterogeneous with two variant subunit types. Because of the large size of hemocyanin, it is usually found free-floating in the blood, unlike hemoglobin.

Hexamers are characteristic of arthropod hemocyanins. A hemocyanin of the tarantula &quot;Eurypelma californicum&quot; is made up of 4 hexamers or 24 peptide chains. A hemocyanin from the house centipede &quot;Scutigera coleoptrata&quot; is made up of 6 hexamers or 36 chains. Horseshoe crabs have an 8-hexamer (i. e. 48-chain) hemocyanin. Simple hexamers are found in the spiny lobster &quot;Panulirus interruptus&quot; and the isopod &quot;Bathynomus giganteus&quot;. Peptide chains in crustaceans are about 660 amino acid residues long, and in chelicerates they are about 625. In the large complexes there is a variety of variant chains, all about the same length; pure components do not usually self-assemble.

== Catalytic activity ==

Hemocyanin is homologous to the phenol oxidases (e.g. tyrosinase) since both proteins have histidine residues, called &quot;type 3&quot; copper-binding coordination centers, as do the enzymes tyrosinase and catechol oxidase. In both cases inactive precursors to the enzymes (also called zymogens or proenzymes) must be activated first. This is done by removing the amino acid that blocks the entrance channel to the active site when the proenzyme is not active. There is currently no other known modifications necessary to activate the proenzyme and enable catalytic activity. Conformational differences determine the type of catalytic activity that the hemocyanin is able to perform. Hemocyanin also exhibits phenol oxidase activity, but with slowed kinetics from greater steric bulk at the active site. Partial denaturation actually improves hemocyanin&#x27;s phenol oxidase activity by providing greater access to the active site.

== Spectral properties ==
Spectroscopy of oxyhemocyanin shows several salient features:
# Resonance Raman spectroscopy shows that is bound in a symmetric environment (ν(O-O) is not IR-allowed).
# OxyHc is EPR-silent indicating the absence of unpaired electrons
# Infrared spectroscopy shows ν(O-O) of 755 cm−1

Much work has been devoted to preparing synthetic analogues of the active site of hemocyanin. One such model, which features a pair of copper centers bridged side-on by peroxo ligand, shows ν(O-O) at 741 cm−1 and a UV-Vis spectrum with absorbances at 349 and 551 nm. Both of these measurements agree with the experimental observations for oxyHc. The Cu-Cu separation in the model complex is 3.56 Å, that of oxyhemocyanin is ca. 3.6 Å (deoxyHc: ca. 4.6 Å).

== Anticancer effects ==

The hemocyanin found in the blood of the Chilean abalone, &quot;Concholepas concholepas&quot;, has immunotherapeutic effects against bladder cancer in murine models. Mice primed with &quot;C. concholepas&quot; before implantation of bladder tumor (MBT-2) cells. Mice treated with &quot;C. concholepas&quot; hemocyanin showed antitumor effects: prolonged survival, decreased tumor growth and incidence, and lack of toxic effects and may have a potential use in future immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer.

Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is an immune stimulant derived from circulating glycoproteins of the marine mollusk &quot;Megathura crenulata&quot;. KLH has been shown to be a significant treatment against the proliferations of breast cancer, pancreas cancer, and prostate cancer cells when delivered in vitro. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin inhibits growth of human Barrett&#x27;s esophageal cancer through both apoptic and nonapoptic mechanisms of cell death.

== Case studies: environmental impact on hemocyanin levels ==
A 2003 study of the effect of culture conditions of blood metabolites and hemocyanin of the white shrimp &quot;Litopenaeus vannamei&quot; found that the levels of hemocyanin, oxyhemocyanin in particular, are affected by the diet. The study compared oxyhemocyanin levels in the blood of white shrimp housed in an indoor pond with a commercial diet with that of white shrimp housed in an outdoor pond with a more readily available protein source (natural live food) as well. Oxyhemocyanin and blood glucose levels were higher in shrimp housed in outdoor ponds. It was also found that blood metabolite levels tended to be lower in low activity level species, such as crabs, lobsters, and the indoor shrimp when compared to the outdoor shrimp. This correlation is possibly indicative of the morphological and physiological evolution of crustaceans. The levels of these blood proteins and metabolites appear to be dependent on energetic demands and availability of those energy sources.

<doc id="103326" wikidata="Q184814" url="?curid=103326" title="Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood">
<text>The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (PRB), later known as the Pre-Raphaelites, was a group of English painters, poets, and art critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner who formed a seven-member &quot;Brotherhood&quot; partly modelled on the Nazarene movement. The Brotherhood was only ever a loose association and their principles were shared by other artists of the time, including Ford Madox Brown, Arthur Hughes and Marie Spartali Stillman. Later followers of the principles of the Brotherhood included Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris and John William Waterhouse.

The group sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian art. They rejected what they regarded as the mechanistic approach first adopted by Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The Brotherhood believed the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art, hence the name &quot;Pre-Raphaelite&quot;. In particular, the group objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called &quot;Sir Sloshua&quot;. To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, &quot;sloshy&quot; meant &quot;anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind&quot;. The group associated their work with John Ruskin, an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background. Christian themes were abundant.

The group continued to accept the concepts of history painting and mimesis, imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. The Pre-Raphaelites defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, &quot;The Germ&quot;, to promote their ideas. The group&#x27;s debates were recorded in the &quot;Pre-Raphaelite Journal&quot;. The Brotherhood separated after almost five years.

==Beginnings==

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in John Millais&#x27;s parents&#x27; house on Gower Street, London in 1848. At the first meeting, the painters John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and William Holman Hunt were present. Hunt and Millais were students at the Royal Academy of Arts and had met in another loose association, the Cyclographic Club, a sketching society. At his own request Rossetti became a pupil of Ford Madox Brown in 1848. At that date, Rossetti and Hunt shared lodgings in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, Central London. Hunt had started painting &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; based on Keats&#x27;s poem of the same name, but it was not completed until 1867.

As an aspiring poet, Rossetti wished to develop the links between Romantic poetry and art. By autumn, four more members, painters James Collinson and Frederic George Stephens, Rossetti&#x27;s brother, poet and critic William Michael Rossetti, and sculptor Thomas Woolner, had joined to form a seven-member-strong brotherhood. Ford Madox Brown was invited to join, but the more senior artist remained independent but supported the group throughout the PRB period of Pre-Raphaelitism and contributed to &quot;The Germ&quot;. Other young painters and sculptors became close associates, including Charles Allston Collins, and Alexander Munro. The PRB intended to keep the existence of the brotherhood secret from members of the Royal Academy.

==Early doctrines==
The brotherhood&#x27;s early doctrines, as defined by William Michael Rossetti, were expressed in four declarations:

# to have genuine ideas to express;
# to study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
# to sympathise with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote; and
# most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.

The principles were deliberately non-dogmatic, since the brotherhood wished to emphasise the personal responsibility of individual artists to determine their own ideas and methods of depiction. Influenced by Romanticism, the members thought freedom and responsibility were inseparable. Nevertheless, they were particularly fascinated by medieval culture, believing it to possess a spiritual and creative integrity that had been lost in later eras. The emphasis on medieval culture clashed with principles of realism which stress the independent observation of nature. In its early stages, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood believed its two interests were consistent with one another, but in later years the movement divided and moved in two directions. The realists were led by Hunt and Millais, while the medievalists were led by Rossetti and his followers, Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. The split was never absolute, since both factions believed that art was essentially spiritual in character, opposing their idealism to the materialist realism associated with Courbet and Impressionism.

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was greatly influenced by nature and its members used great detail to show the natural world using bright and sharp-focus techniques on a white canvas. In attempts to revive the brilliance of colour found in Quattrocento art, Hunt and Millais developed a technique of painting in thin glazes of pigment over a wet white ground in the hope that the colours would retain jewel-like transparency and clarity. Their emphasis on brilliance of colour was a reaction to the excessive use of bitumen by earlier British artists, such as Reynolds, David Wilkie and Benjamin Robert Haydon. Bitumen produces unstable areas of muddy darkness, an effect the Pre-Raphaelites despised.

In 1848, Rossetti and Hunt made a list of &quot;Immortals&quot;, artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including Keats and Tennyson.

==First exhibitions and publications==
The first exhibitions of Pre-Raphaelite work occurred in 1849. Both Millais&#x27;s &quot;Isabella&quot; (1848–1849) and Holman Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Rienzi&quot; (1848–1849) were exhibited at the Royal Academy. Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;The Girlhood of Mary Virgin&quot; was shown at a Free Exhibition on Hyde Park Corner. As agreed, all members of the brotherhood signed their work with their name and the initials &quot;PRB&quot;. Between January and April 1850, the group published a literary magazine, &quot;The Germ&quot; edited by William Rossetti which published poetry by the Rossettis, Woolner, and Collinson and essays on art and literature by associates of the brotherhood, such as Coventry Patmore. As the short run-time implies, the magazine did not manage to achieve sustained momentum. (Daly 1989)

==Public controversy==

In 1850, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood became the subject of controversy after the exhibition of Millais&#x27; painting &quot;Christ in the House of His Parents&quot; was considered to be blasphemous by many reviewers, notably Charles Dickens. Dickens considered Millais&#x27;s Mary to be ugly. Millais had used his sister-in-law, Mary Hodgkinson, as the model for Mary in his painting. The brotherhood&#x27;s medievalism was attacked as backward-looking and its extreme devotion to detail was condemned as ugly and jarring to the eye. According to Dickens, Millais made the Holy Family look like alcoholics and slum-dwellers, adopting contorted and absurd &quot;medieval&quot; poses.

After the controversy, James Collinson resigned from the Brotherhood due to his belief that it was bringing the Christian religion into disrepute. The remaining members met to discuss whether he should be replaced by Charles Allston Collins or Walter Howell Deverell, but were unable to make a decision. From that point the group disbanded, though its influence continued. Artists who had worked in the style initially continued but no longer signed works &quot;PRB&quot;.
The brotherhood found support from the critic John Ruskin, who praised its devotion to nature and rejection of conventional methods of composition. The Pre-Raphaelites were influenced by Ruskin&#x27;s theories. He wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; defending their work and subsequently met them. Initially, he favoured Millais, who travelled to Scotland in the summer of 1853 with Ruskin and Ruskin&#x27;s wife, Euphemia Chalmers Ruskin, née Gray (now best known as Effie Gray). The main object of the journey was to paint Ruskin&#x27;s portrait. Effie became increasingly attached to Millais, creating a crisis. In subsequent annulment proceedings, Ruskin himself made a statement to his lawyer to the effect that his marriage had been unconsummated. The marriage was annulled on grounds of non-consummation, leaving Effie free to marry Millais, but causing a public scandal. Millais began to move away from the Pre-Raphaelite style after his marriage, and Ruskin ultimately attacked his later works. Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti and provided funds to encourage the art of Elizabeth Siddall, Rossetti&#x27;s wife.

By 1853 the original PRB had virtually dissolved, with only Holman Hunt remaining true to its stated aims. But the term &quot;Pre-Raphaelite&quot; stuck to Rossetti and others, including William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, with whom he became involved in Oxford in 1857. Hence the term Pre-Raphaelite is associated with a much wider and long-lived art movement.

==Later developments and influence==

Artists influenced by the brotherhood include John Brett, Philip Calderon, Arthur Hughes, Gustave Moreau, Evelyn De Morgan, Frederic Sandys (who entered the Pre-Raphaelite circle in 1857) and John William Waterhouse. Ford Madox Brown, who was associated with them from the beginning, is often seen as most closely adopting the Pre-Raphaelite principles. One follower who developed his own distinct style was Aubrey Beardsley, who was pre-eminently influenced by Burne-Jones.

After 1856, Dante Gabriel Rossetti became an inspiration for the medievalising strand of the movement. He was the link between the two types of Pre-Raphaelite painting (nature and Romance) after the PRB became lost in the later decades of the century. Rossetti, although the least committed to the brotherhood, continued the name and changed its style. He began painting versions of femme fatales using models including Jane Morris, in paintings such as &quot;Proserpine&quot;, &quot;The Day Dream&quot;, and &quot;La Pia de&#x27; Tolomei&quot;. His work influenced his friend William Morris, in whose firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. he became a partner, and with whose wife Jane he may have had an affair. Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones also became partners in the firm. Through Morris&#x27;s company, the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood influenced many interior designers and architects, arousing interest in medieval designs and other crafts leading to the Arts and Crafts movement headed by William Morris. Holman Hunt was involved with the movement to reform design through the Della Robbia Pottery company.

After 1850, Hunt and Millais moved away from direct imitation of medieval art. They stressed the realist and scientific aspects of the movement, though Hunt continued to emphasise the spiritual significance of art, seeking to reconcile religion and science by making accurate observations and studies of locations in Egypt and Palestine for his paintings on biblical subjects. In contrast, Millais abandoned Pre-Raphaelitism after 1860, adopting a much broader and looser style influenced by Reynolds. William Morris and others condemned his reversal of principles.
Pre-Raphaelitism had a significant impact in Scotland and on Scottish artists. The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born William Dyce (1806–1864). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to Ruskin. His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his &quot;The Man of Sorrows&quot; and &quot;David in the Wilderness&quot; (both 1860), which contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail. Joseph Noel Paton (1821–1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of Millais and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as &quot;The Bludie Tryst&quot; (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality. Also influenced by Millais was James Archer (1823–1904), whose work includes &quot;Summertime, Gloucestershire&quot; (1860) and who from 1861 began a series of Arthurian-based paintings including &quot;La Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and &quot;Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere&quot;.

Pre-Raphaelism also inspired painters like Lawrence Alma-Tadema. The movement influenced many later British artists into the 20th century.

Rossetti came to be seen as a precursor of the wider European Symbolist movement. There is evidence to suggest that a number of paintings by the German artist Paula Modersohn-Becker were influenced by Rossetti.

Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery has a world-renowned collection of works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites that, some claim, strongly influenced the young J. R. R. Tolkien, who wrote &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, with influences taken from the same mythological scenes portrayed by the Pre-Raphaelites. Tolkien considered his own group of school friends and artistic associates, the so-called TCBS, as a group in the vein of the Pre-Raphaelites.

In the 20th century artistic ideals changed, and art moved away from representing reality. After the First World War, Pre-Raphaelite art was devalued for its literary qualities and was scorned by critics as sentimental and concocted &quot;artistic bric-a-brac&quot;. In the 1960s there was a major revival of Pre-Raphaelitism. Exhibitions and catalogues of works, culminating in a 1984 exhibition in London&#x27;s Tate Gallery, re-established a canon of Pre-Raphaelite work. Among many other exhibitions, there was another large show at Tate Britain in 2012–13.

In the late 20th century the Brotherhood of Ruralists based its aims on Pre-Raphaelitism, while the Stuckists and the Birmingham Group have also derived inspiration from it.

==Illustration and poetry==
Many members of the &#x27;inner&#x27; Pre-Raphaelite circle (Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones) and &#x27;outer&#x27; circle (Frederick Sandys, Arthur Hughes, Simeon Solomon, Henry Hugh Armstead, Joseph Noel Paton, Frederic Shields, Matthew James Lawless) were working concurrently in painting, illustration, and sometimes poetry. Victorian morality judged literature as superior to painting, because of its &quot;noble grounds for noble emotion.&quot; Robert Buchanan (a writer and opponent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) felt so strongly about this artistic hierarchy that he wrote: &quot;The truth is that literature, and more particularly poetry, is in a very bad way when one art gets hold of another, and imposes upon it its conditions and limitations.&quot; This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize subject painting, which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the Sister Arts), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan.

The Pre-Raphaelite desire for more extensive affiliation between painting and literature also manifested in illustration. Illustration is a more direct unification of these media and, like subject painting, can assert a narrative of its own. For the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti specifically, there was anxiety about the constraints of illustration. In 1855, Rossetti wrote to William Allingham about the independence of illustration: &quot;I have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the &#x27;Vision of Sin&#x27; and &#x27;Palace of Art&#x27; etc. – those where one can allegorize on one&#x27;s own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet&#x27;s.&quot; This passage makes apparent Rossetti&#x27;s desire to not just support the poet&#x27;s narrative, but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well. In this respect, Pre-Raphaelite illustrations go beyond depicting an episode from a poem, but rather function like subject paintings within a text.

==Collections==

There are major collections of Pre-Raphaelite work in United Kingdom museums such as the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, the Tate Gallery, Victoria and Albert Museum, Manchester Art Gallery, Lady Lever Art Gallery, and Liverpool&#x27;s Walker Art Gallery. The Art Gallery of South Australia and the Delaware Art Museum in the US have the most significant collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside the UK. The Museo de Arte de Ponce in Puerto Rico also has a notable collection of Pre-Raphaelite works, including Sir Edward Burne-Jones&#x27; &quot;The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon&quot;, Frederic Lord Leighton&#x27;s &quot;Flaming June&quot;, and works by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Frederic Sandys. The Ger Eenens Collection The Netherlands includes a work by John Collier, Circe (signed and dated 1885), that was exhibited at the Chicago World Fair 1893. The British exhibit occupied 14 rooms, showcased a theme familiar with the Fair&#x27;s outlook, hence they had a sizeable exhibit of Pre-Raphaelite and New-Classical painters. They were extremely well received.

There is a set of Pre-Raphaelite murals in the Old Library at the Oxford Union, depicting scenes from the Arthurian legends, painted between 1857 and 1859 by a team of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, and Edward Burne-Jones. The National Trust houses at Wightwick Manor, Wolverhampton, and at Wallington Hall, Northumberland, both have significant and representative collections. Andrew Lloyd Webber is an avid collector of Pre-Raphaelite works, and a selection of 300 items from his collection were shown at an exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 2003.

Kelmscott Manor, the country home of William Morris from 1871 until his death in 1896, is owned by the Society of Antiquaries of London and is open to the public. The Manor is featured in Morris&#x27; 1890 novel &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;. It also appears in the background of &quot;Water Willow&quot;, a portrait of his wife, Jane Morris, painted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1871. There are exhibitions connected with Morris and Rossetti&#x27;s early experiments with photography.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
The story of the brotherhood, from its controversial first exhibition to being embraced by the art establishment, has been depicted in two BBC television series. The first, &quot;The Love School&quot;, was broadcast in 1975; the second is the 2009 BBC television drama serial &quot;Desperate Romantics&quot; by Peter Bowker. Although much of the latter&#x27;s material is derived from Franny Moyle&#x27;s factual book &quot;Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites&quot;, the series occasionally departs from established facts in favour of dramatic licence and is prefaced by the disclaimer: &quot;In the mid-19th century, a group of young men challenged the art establishment of the day. The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were inspired by the real world around them, yet took imaginative licence in their art. This story, based on their lives and loves, follows in that inventive spirit.&quot;

Ken Russell&#x27;s television film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; (1967) contains brief scenes on some of the leading Pre-Raphaelites but mainly concentrates on the life of Rossetti, played by Oliver Reed.

Chapter 36 of the 1952 novel &quot;East of Eden&quot; by John Steinbeck references pre-Raphaelite influenced images used to identify different classrooms: &quot;The pictures identified the rooms, and the pre-Raphaelite influence was overwhelming. Galahad standing in full armor pointed the way for third-graders; Atalanta&#x27;s race urged on the fourth, the &quot;Pot of Basil&quot; confused the fifth grade, and so on until the denunciation of Catiline sent the eighth-graders on to high school with a sense of high civic virtue. Cal and Aron were assigned to the seventh grade because of their age, and they learned every shadow of its picture—Laocoön completely wrapped in snakes&quot;.

<text>&quot;Where Is Everybody?&quot; is the first episode of the American anthology television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and was originally broadcast on October 2, 1959, on CBS. It is one of the most realistic &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes, as it features no supernatural elements and is based on fairly straightforward extrapolation of science.

==Opening narration==

===Televised pilot===
The following narration was used in the later-released versions of the episode which had been dubbed over by Rod Serling as narrator, where the phrase &quot;the sixth dimension&quot; is replaced with &quot;the fifth dimension&quot; to fall in line with later episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

===&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;===
==Plot==
A man finds himself walking alone on a dirt road, with no memory of who he is or how he got there. He finds a diner and walks in to find a jukebox playing loudly, but nobody present; he lowers the volume and continues to call out. Eventually, he heads into the kitchen where he finds a hot pot of coffee on the stove and freshly made pies, but still no other people besides himself. He accidentally knocks over and breaks a clock, at which point the jukebox stops playing.

The man leaves the diner and walks to a nearby town; he sees a parked truck with an apparent female passenger, but &quot;she&quot; turns out to be a mannequin. Like the diner, the rest of the town seems deserted, but the man feels he is being watched and that there is someone around. The phone rings in a telephone booth and he dashes to answer it. There is nobody on the line and he can only raise a recorded message when he tries to call the operator. He grows unsettled as he wanders through the empty town, increasingly anxious to find someone to talk to.

Inside the police station, he uses the radio (&quot;Calling all cars, calling all cars, unknown man walking around police station...&quot;); then he notices a lit cigar in an ashtray. This prods him to check the jail cells in back. In one cell, there is evidence that someone had recently been there shaving. He declares that he wants to &quot;wake up now&quot;, and makes his way to the soda shop. As he makes himself a sundae, he considers his situation to be a dream he must be having and marvels at how detailed it is. He idly spins a few racks of paperback books until he notices an entire rack of books titled &quot;The Last Man on Earth, Feb. 1959&quot; already spinning. This spooks him and he quickly leaves.

As night falls, lights turn on and the man is drawn to the illuminated movie theater marquee. The advertised film is &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; and an advertisement outside of a man dressed as he is, directing a fighter jet on the tarmac, causes him to realize that he is in the U.S. Air Force. Running inside and finding nobody in the audience, he begins to wonder what could have happened with the Air Force that resulted in his being in this situation, until the film begins to play. He runs to the projection booth, finding it empty; in a panic, he runs downstairs and crashes into a mirror. When he recovers from this shock, he gives in to terror and races through the streets until he comes upon a &quot;walk&quot; button and desperately pushes it over and over, begging for help. The button is revealed to be a panic button: the man—Sergeant Mike Ferris—is actually in an isolation booth being observed by a group of uniformed servicemen. He has been undergoing tests to determine his fitness as an astronaut and whether he can handle a prolonged trip to the Moon alone; the town was a hallucination caused by sensory deprivation. He had been in the booth for over 484 hours.

The officiating general warns Ferris that while his basic needs will be provided for in space travel, he will not have companionship: &quot;next time [he will] really be alone&quot;. As Ferris is carried from the hangar on a stretcher, he looks into the sky and tells the Moon, &quot;don&#x27;t go away up there&quot; and, &quot;we&#x27;ll be up there in a little while&quot;.

==Closing narration==
==Preview for next week&#x27;s story==
== Production ==
Serling&#x27;s original pilot for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; was &quot;The Happy Place&quot;, which revolved around a society in which people were executed upon reaching the age of 60, being considered no longer useful. CBS executive William Self rejected the story, feeling it was too dark; Serling eventually relented and wrote &quot;Where is Everybody?&quot; as a more acceptable substitute. Unlike other episodes, which were filmed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, &quot;Where is Everybody?&quot; was filmed at Universal Studios, using Courthouse Square as the episode&#x27;s Oakwood town.

The episode originally featured Westbrook Van Voorhis as narrator. When Voorhis was unavailable for later episodes, Serling re-recorded the narration himself for consistency. Serling notably changed the opening narration to place the Twilight Zone within the fifth dimension, among other alterations.

Serling later adapted &quot;Where is Everybody?&quot; for a novelization titled &quot;Stories From the Twilight Zone&quot;. Serling allegedly grew dissatisfied with the lack of science fiction content and changed the story to include Ferris discovering a movie ticket in his pocket while on the stretcher. A variation on this plotline was used in the episode &quot;&quot;King Nine&quot; Will Not Return&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the episode, saying that Serling proved &quot;that science cannot foretell what may be the effect of total isolation on a human being&quot;, though &quot;[the episode&#x27;s] resolution... seemed trite and anticlimactic. In the desultory field of filmed half-hour drama, however, Mr. Serling should not have much trouble in making his mark. At least his series promises to be different.&quot;

Charles Beaumont praised the episode in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, writing that he &quot;read Serling&#x27;s first script... Old stuff? Of course. I thought so at the time... but there was one element in the story which kept me from my customary bitterness. The element was quality. Quality shone on every page. It shone in the dialogue and in the scene set-ups. And because of this, the story seemed fresh and new and powerful. There was one compromise, but it was made for the purpose of selling the series.&quot;

<doc id="103328" wikidata="Q322001" url="?curid=103328" title="William Wollaston">
<text>William Wollaston (; 26 March 165929 October 1724) was an English school teacher, Church of England priest, scholar of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, theologian, and a major Enlightenment era English philosopher. He is remembered today for one book, which he completed two years before his death: &quot;The Religion of Nature Delineated&quot;. He led a cloistered life, but in terms of eighteenth-century philosophy and the concept of natural religion, he is ranked with British Enlightenment philosophers such as Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.

Wollaston&#x27;s work contributed to the development of two important intellectual schools: British Deism, and &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; moral philosophy of American Practical Idealism, a phrase which appears in the United States Declaration of Independence.

==Life==
Wollaston was born at Coton Clanford in Staffordshire, on 26 March 1659. He was born to a family long-established in Staffordshire, and was distantly related to Sir John Wollaston, the Alderman and Lord Mayor of London. However, his family was not wealthy. At the age of ten, he began school at a Latin school newly opened in Shenstone, Staffordshire, and continued in country free schools until he was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, at the age of 15, in June 1674. From his writings it is clear that he was an excellent scholar, &quot;extremely well versed&quot; in languages and literature.

In his last year at Cambridge, Wollaston published anonymously a small book, &quot;On the Design of the Book of Ecclesiastes, or the Unreasonableness of Men&#x27;s Restless Contention for the Present Enjoyments, represented in an English Poem&quot; (London, 1691). Apparently embarrassed by his own work, Wollaston almost immediately suppressed it.
After leaving Cambridge in September 1681, he became an assistant master at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham and took holy orders. At this time, he became Perpetual curate of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Moseley from 16841686.

In 1688 his cousin William Wollaston of Shenton left him a fortune and the family estates, including Finborough manor, Suffolk and the reversion of Shenton Hall, Leicestershire, and in November of the same year he settled in London. There Wollaston devoted himself to private study of learning and philosophy, seldom leaving the city and declining to accept any public employment. In retirement, he published &quot;The Religion of Nature Delineated&quot; (1722) in a private edition. He wrote extensively on language, philosophy, religion, and history, but in the last few years of his life, he committed most of his manuscripts to the flames, as his health worsened and he began to feel that he would never be able to complete them to his satisfaction.

Wollaston suffered from fragile health throughout his life. Just after completing &quot;The Religion of Nature Delineated&quot;, he broke his arm in an accident, and his strength declined and illnesses increased until his death on 29 October 1724. His body was carried to Great Finborough in Suffolk, where he was buried beside his wife.

==&quot;The Religion of Nature Delineated&quot;==
===Argument===

The &quot;Religion of Nature Delineated&quot; was an attempt to create a system of ethics without recourse to revealed religion. He claimed originality for his theory that the moral evil is the practical denial of a true proposition and moral good the affirmation of it, writing that this attempt to use mathematics to create a rationalist ethics was &quot;something never met with anywhere&quot;. Wollaston &quot;held that religious truths were plain as Euclid, clear to all who contemplated Creation.&quot; Newton had induced natural laws from a mathematical model of the physical world; similarly, Wollaston was attempting to induce moral laws by a mathematical model of the moral world.

===Influence===

More than 10,000 copies were sold in the just first few years alone with 15 imprints prior to 1800. A biography of the author was added to the 8th edition in 1750.

Wollaston&#x27;s idea of a Natural religion without revelation briefly inspired and revived the movement known as Deism in England. Some today consider him a &quot;Christian Deist&quot;, while others note that there is no &quot;significant evidence that William Wollaston was not a more or less orthodox Christian.&quot;

Although Wollaston&#x27;s ideas could be argued to have anticipated both Scottish Common Sense Realism and Utilitarianism proponents of later schools of philosophy criticised and sometimes even ridiculed Wollaston. These included Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Richard Price, and Jeremy Bentham.

After 1759 no further edition of his work was published in the rest of the century.

Benjamin Franklin worked as a compositor on one of the 1726 editions of the book and wrote the short pamphlet &quot;A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain&quot; in response. Later, however, he found his pamphlet &quot;so shallow and unconvincing as to be embarrassing&quot;, and burned as many copies as he could find. Although rejecting Deism, he retained a fondness for the &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot;, believing that God was best served by doing good works and helping other people.

It was a major influence on the American educator Rev. Dr. Samuel Johnson&#x27;s college philosophy textbooks. Its focus on practice as well as speculation attracted a more mature Franklin, who commissioned and published Johnson&#x27;s textbook &quot;Elementa Philosophica&quot; in 1752, then promoted it in the College of Philadelphia (now Penn University).

==Family==
On 26 November 1689, Wollaston married Catharine Charlton (died 21 July 1720). They had eleven children together, four of whom died within his lifetime. They included:

*Charlton, the eldest son, died unmarried in 1729
*William, Member of Parliament for Ipswich
*Francis (1694–1774) FRS, third son
*John, fifth son, died 1720.

<text>Myriam Bédard, (born December 22, 1969) is a Canadian retired biathlete. She represented Canada at two Winter Olympics winning gold medals, and a bronze medal. As of 2022, Bédard is the only Canadian biathlete, male or female, ever to win an Olympic medal, and the only North American biathlete ever to win Olympic gold.

==Olympic career==
Myriam Bédard was born in 1969. Born in Loretteville, Quebec, Bédard learned marksmanship as a member of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets&#x27; 2772 cadet corps, which she joined at the age of 15, and participated in her first biathlon event at age 15. She became Canadian junior champion in the sport in 1987.

In 1991, Bédard was the second Canadian to win a biathlon World Cup event, and she formed part of the Canadian team at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France – the first time women competed in biathlon at the Olympics – and Bédard won a bronze medal in the 15 km. The following year she won her first major title, as she won the 7.5 km event at the World Championships, also placing second in the 15 km race.

At the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, she improved this performance and won both individual events, then served as Canada&#x27;s flag bearer in the closing ceremony. She was also awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy in 1994 for the year&#x27;s top performance by a Canadian athlete, as well as the Velma Springstead Trophy for best Canadian female athlete.

In March 1994, she was awarded the Meritorious Service Cross.

She is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada, student # S120...

==Post-Olympic career==
She briefly retired from the sport to give birth to her daughter (the father was another biathlete, and soldier, Jean Paquet). Her comeback was not very successful, being hampered by injuries. After the 1998 Winter Olympics, Bédard retired from biathlon. She later announced an attempt to make the Canadian Olympic team as a speed skater, but did not pursue this goal for long. In 2004, Bédard was one of eight persons (and the only woman) in the International Biathlon Union&#x27;s (IBU) executive board, where she served as the IBU&#x27;s vice-president responsible for special issues.

On February 27, 2004, in the context of the sponsorship scandal that came to light soon after Prime Minister Jean Chrétien left office, Bédard asserted that she had been forced to resign from her marketing department job at Via Rail in 2002 shortly after raising concerns about the company&#x27;s dealings with advertiser Groupaction. Responses to her allegations led to the firings a few days later of Via Rail chair Jean Pelletier and president Marc LeFrançois.

However, in testimony before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts in late March 2004, Bédard made further allegations that were met with widespread skepticism: she claimed that she had been told that Groupaction was involved in drug trafficking, that her partner Nima Mazhari had personally convinced Prime Minister Chrétien to keep Canada out of the war in Iraq, and that Québécois race car legend Jacques Villeneuve had been paid $12 million to wear a Canadian flag on his uniform. Villeneuve strongly denied the latter allegation, calling it &quot;ludicrous.&quot;

According to CBC News, an arbitrator&#x27;s report later concluded that Bédard had voluntarily left Via Rail.

On December 8, 2006, a Canada-wide arrest warrant was issued for Bédard for the abduction of her daughter. Bédard was in Washington, D.C. Bédard was arrested by the United States Marshals Service in Columbia, Maryland. She was detained in Columbia, Maryland until her extradition to Canada. She appeared in court in Baltimore, Maryland on December 26, 2006. Her daughter was under the care of the United States Marshals Service prior to being returned to her father December 23. Bédard returned to Canada on January 4, 2007. On September 20, 2007, a jury at a Quebec City found Bédard guilty of child abduction for violating a child custody agreement. On October 9, 2007, she was sentenced to a conditional discharge and two years probation. Bédard was also charged with contempt of court later on and sentenced to 45 days of community service.

<text>English Nature was the United Kingdom government agency that promoted the conservation of wildlife, geology and wild places throughout England between 1990 and 2006. It was a non-departmental public body funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and gave statutory advice, grants and issued licences.

The Nature Conservancy Council (NCC) (formerly the Nature Conservancy) was established by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to cover nature conservation issues across the whole of Great Britain. The NCC was split into four by the Environmental Protection Act 1990—its English duties being given to English Nature. In Scotland, its functions were merged with those of the Countryside Commission for Scotland to form Scottish Natural Heritage, and similarly in Wales there was a merger to form the Countryside Council for Wales. A much smaller body, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), supported all three agencies. The English functions of the Countryside Commission went to the newly formed Countryside Agency.

English Nature worked closely with the JNCC and the equivalent bodies for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland Environment Agency) to bring a consistent approach to nature conservation throughout the United Kingdom and towards fulfilling its international obligations.

The agency ceased to exist in October 2006 following a review by Lord Haskins, enacted in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. It was integrated with parts of both the Rural Development Service and the Countryside Agency from 1 October 2006, to form a new body called Natural England.

<doc id="103341" wikidata="Q955278" url="?curid=103341" title="Kirby Puckett">
<text>Kirby Puckett (March 14, 1960 – March 6, 2006) was an American professional baseball player. He played his entire 12-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career for the Minnesota Twins (1984–1995). Puckett was instrumental in helping the Twins to win World Series championships in 1987 and 1991. Puckett generally played center field, although he was shifted to right field later in his career.

Puckett was a popular player due to his charisma and his passion for the game as well as his skills. He is known for having hit a dramatic game-winning home run in Game Six of the 1991 World Series. Puckett led the American League in batting with a .339 average in 1989 and led the league with 112 runs batted in in 1994. Overall, he won six Silver Slugger Awards and six Gold Gloves during his playing career and was named to the AL All-Star Team 10 times. He finished his career with a .318 batting average, 207 home runs, and 1085 runs batted in. 

After being forced to retire in 1996 at age 36 due to loss of vision in one eye from a central retinal vein occlusion, Puckett was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001 in his first year of eligibility. 

==Early life==
Kirby Puckett was born March 14, 1960, in Chicago, Illinois. The youngest of William and Catherine Puckett&#x27;s nine children, Kirby was born 22 years after his oldest sibling, Charles. Puckett&#x27;s father worked two full-time jobs at a department store and the post office, leaving Catherine to raise the children. Raised in a three-bedroom apartment in the Robert Taylor Homes Chicago housing project, Puckett taught himself to play baseball by practicing hitting and throwing against a wall.

An All-American baseball player at Calumet High School, Puckett received little attention from baseball scouts, and he took a job installing carpeting in new cars for the Ford Motor Company. After being laid off by Ford, Puckett attended an open tryout hosted by the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball (MLB), where he received a college baseball scholarship from Bradley University. During the 1981 season, Puckett led the Bradley Braves with eight home runs, 21 stolen bases, and a .660 slugging percentage, while his .378 batting average was second on the team. His grades suffered following the sudden death of his father, however, and he transferred to Triton College after one year. During the 1982 season at Triton, Puckett batted .472 with 16 home runs and 78 runs batted in (RBI), and he was named the National Junior College Athletic Association Player of the Year.

==Career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
As teams tried to save money during the 1981 MLB strike, only one scout watched Puckett at Bradley: Jim Rantz of the Minnesota Twins, who recommended that the team take him third overall in the January 1982 MLB draft. Puckett turned down the Twins&#x27; initial $6,000 contract, signing with them for $20,000 after the JUCO World Series. After signing with Minnesota, Puckett was assigned to the Rookie-level Elizabethton Twins, where he batted .382 with three home runs and 35 RBI in 65 games, winning the Appalachian League batting title in the process.

In 1983, Puckett was promoted to the Single-A Visalia Oaks in the California League, where he hit .318 with nine home runs, 97 RBI, and 48 stolen bases over 138 games. After being promoted to the AAA Toledo Mud Hens to start the 1984 season, Puckett was brought up to the majors for good 21 games into the season.

===Minnesota Twins===
Puckett&#x27;s major league debut came on May 8, 1984, against the California Angels, a game in which he went 4-for-5 with one run. That year, Puckett hit .296 and was fourth in the American League in singles. In 1985, Puckett hit .288 and finished fourth in the league in hits, third in triples, second in plate appearances, and first in at bats. Throughout his career, Puckett would routinely appear in the top 10 in the American League in such offensive statistical categories as games played, at bats, singles, doubles, and total bases and such defensive stats as putouts, assists, and fielding percentage for league center fielders.

In 1986, Puckett began to emerge as more than just a singles hitter. With an average of .328, Puckett was elected to his first Major League Baseball All-Star Game and he finished the season seventh in doubles, sixth in home runs, fourth in extra-base hits, third in slugging percentage, and second in runs scored, hits, total bases, and at-bats. Kirby was also recognized for his defensive skills, earning his first Gold Glove Award.

====1987–1990 (First World Series title)====

In 1987, the Twins reached the postseason for the first time since 1970 despite finishing with a mark of 85–77. Once there, Puckett helped lead the Twins to the 1987 World Series, the Twins&#x27; second series appearance since relocating to Minnesota and fifth in franchise history. For the season, Puckett batted .332 with 28 home runs and 99 RBIs. Although he hit only .208 in the Twins&#x27; five game AL Championship Series win over the Detroit Tigers, Puckett would produce in the seven-game World Series upset over the St. Louis Cardinals, where he batted .357.

During the year, Puckett put on his best performance on August 30 in Milwaukee against the Brewers, when he went 6-for-6 with two home runs, one off Juan Nieves in the third and the other off closer Dan Plesac in the ninth.

Statistically speaking, Puckett had his best all-around season in 1988, hitting 24 home runs with a career-high .356 average and 121 RBIs, finishing third in the AL MVP balloting for the second straight season. Although the Twins won 91 games, six more than in their championship season, the team finished a distant second in the American League West, 13 games behind the Oakland Athletics.

Puckett won the AL batting title in 1989 with a mark of .339, while also finishing fifth in at-bats, second in doubles, first in hits, and second in singles. The Twins, two years removed from the championship season, slumped, going 80–82 and finishing in fifth place, 19 games behind the Athletics. In April 1989, he recorded his 1,000th hit, becoming the fourth player in Major League Baseball history to do so in his first five seasons. After the 1989 season, Puckett signed a 3-year, $9 million contract with the Twins, making him the first baseball player to earn at least $3 million per year of salary. He continued to play well in 1990, but had a down season, finishing with a .298 batting average, and the Twins mirrored his performance as the team slipped all the way to last place in the AL West with a record of 74–88.

====1991–1995 (Second World Series title)====
In 1991, the Twins got back on the winning track and Puckett led the way by batting .319, eighth in the league and Minnesota surged past Oakland midseason to capture the division title. The Twins then beat the Toronto Blue Jays in five games in the American League Championship Series as Puckett batted .429 with two home runs and five RBI to win the ALCS MVP.

The subsequent 1991 World Series was ranked by ESPN to be the best ever played, with four games decided on the final pitch and three games going into extra innings. The Twins and their opponent, the Atlanta Braves, had each finished last in their respective divisions in the year before winning their league pennant, something that had never happened before.

Going into Game 6, the Twins trailed three games to two with each team winning their respective home games. Puckett gave the Twins an early lead by driving in Chuck Knoblauch with a triple in the first inning. Puckett then made a leaping catch in front of the Plexiglass wall in left field to rob Ron Gant of an extra-base hit in the third. The game went into extra innings, and in the first at-bat of the bottom of the 11th, Puckett hit a dramatic game-winning home run on a 2–1 count off of Charlie Leibrandt to send the Series to Game 7. This dramatic game has been widely remembered as the high point in Puckett&#x27;s career. The images of Puckett rounding the bases, arms raised in triumph (often punctuated by CBS television broadcaster Jack Buck saying &quot;And we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow night!&quot;) are frequently included in video highlights of his career. The Twins then went on to win Game 7 1–0, with Jack Morris throwing a 10-inning complete game, and claimed their second World Series crown in five years.

Though the Twins didn&#x27;t make it to the postseason for the rest of Puckett&#x27;s career, he remained an elite player. In 1994, Puckett was switched to right field and won his first league RBI title by driving in 112 runs in only 108 games, a pace that projects to 168 RBIs over a full season. He also broke the record for Twins career hits on June 26 with three hits in the game against the Kansas City Royals that the Twins won 11–4, giving him 2,088 hits. Previously Rod Carew held that record with 2,085 hits. But the 1994 season was cut short by a players&#x27; strike, ending his chances for two consecutive RBI titles.

Puckett was still performing well in the 1995 season before having his jaw broken in his final career plate appearance by a Dennis Martínez fastball on September 28.

===Retirement===
After spending the spring of 1996 continuing to blister Grapefruit League batting with a .344 average, Puckett woke up on March 28 without vision in his right eye. He was diagnosed with glaucoma, and was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his professional career. Three surgeries over the next few months could not restore vision in the eye. When it was apparent that he would never be able to play again, Puckett announced his retirement on July 12, 1996, at the age of 36. Following his retirement, the Twins made him an executive vice president of the team. 

Puckett received the 1996 Roberto Clemente Award for community service.

===Legacy===
Puckett won the 1989 American League batting title with a .339 batting average. He also led the league in runs batted in with 112 in 1994. Puckett won six Silver Slugger Awards and six Gold Gloves during his playing career. He was named to the AL All-Star Team 10 times. He finished his career with a .318 batting average, 207 home runs, and 1085 runs batted in. At the time of Puckett&#x27;s retirement, his .318 career batting average was the highest of any right-handed batter since Joe DiMaggio. Also, he amassed 2,040 hits in the first 10 seasons of his career; this total exceeded that of any other 20th-century player.

The Twins retired Puckett&#x27;s number 34 in 1997. In 2001 balloting, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he ranked Number 86 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.

In 1993, Puckett received the Branch Rickey Award for his lifetime of community service work.

On April 12, 2010, a statue of Puckett was unveiled at the plaza of Target Field in Minneapolis. The plaza runs up against the stadium&#x27;s largest gate, Gate 34, numbered in honor of Puckett. The statue, by sculptor Bill Mack, represents Puckett pumping his fist while running the bases after his winning home run in Game 6 of the 1991 World Series.

At the time of his own retirement in 2016, longtime Boston Red Sox first baseman/designated hitter David Ortiz stated that he had used uniform number 34 with the Red Sox to honor Puckett&#x27;s friendship with him. Ortiz began his MLB career with the Twins.

In 1997, Jim Souhan of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;What Puckett meant to the Twins transcended statistics, just as his fire-hydrant-shaped body often crested the Metrodome&#x27;s centerfield fence. He overcame the limits of his short, squat body, and of his upbringing in the projects on Chicago&#x27;s South Side, to demonstrate the joys that baseball can bring a player and a community&quot;.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Puckett was known &quot;for his sunny personality and his passion for baseball&quot;. The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; has stated that Puckett possessed a &quot;blend of Hall of Fame skill and persistent joyfulness&quot; that made him &quot;perhaps the most popular athlete in Minnesota history&quot;. However, Puckett&#x27;s reputation was affected by various incidents in his personal life following his retirement.

==Personal life==
Puckett married his wife, Tonya, in 1986. The Pucketts had two children and divorced in 2002.

Following his retirement, Puckett&#x27;s weight increased to nearly 300 lbs. In March 2002, a woman filed for an order of protection against Puckett&#x27;s wife, Tonya Puckett, claiming that Tonya had threatened to kill her over an alleged affair with Puckett. Later that same month, another woman asked for protection from Puckett himself, claiming in court documents that he had shoved her in his Bloomington condominium during the course of an 18-year relationship.

In September 2002, Puckett was accused of groping a woman in a restaurant bathroom and was charged with false imprisonment, fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct, and fifth-degree assault. He was found not guilty on all counts.

The March 17, 2003, edition of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; included an article by columnist Frank Deford entitled &quot;The Rise and Fall of Kirby Puckett&quot;. The article contrasted Puckett&#x27;s private life with his public image. Deford reported that Tonya Puckett alleged that Puckett had physically abused her and threatened to kill her on multiple occasions. He also reported that Puckett had engaged in multiple adulterous relationships.

==Death==
On the morning of March 5, 2006, Puckett suffered a massive hemorrhagic stroke at the home he shared with his fiancée, Jodi Olson. He underwent emergency surgery that day to relieve pressure on his brain; however, the surgery failed, and his former teammates and coaches were notified the following morning that his death was near. Many, including 1991 Twins teammates Shane Mack and Kent Hrbek, flew to Phoenix to be at his bedside during his final hours along with Puckett&#x27;s two children. His fiancée never left his side. Puckett died at the age of 45 on March 6 shortly after being disconnected from life support.

In the subsequent autopsy, the official cause of death was recorded as &quot;cerebral hemorrhage due to hypertension&quot;. Puckett died at the second-youngest age (behind Lou Gehrig) of any Hall of Famer inducted while living, and the youngest to die after being inducted in the modern era of the five-season waiting period. Puckett was survived by his son Kirby Jr. and daughter Catherine.

A private memorial service was held in the Twin Cities suburb of Wayzata on the afternoon of March 12 (declared &quot;Kirby Puckett Day&quot; in Minneapolis), followed by a public ceremony held at the Metrodome attended by family, friends, ballplayers past and present, and approximately 15,000 fans (an anticipated capacity crowd dwindled through the day due to an impending blizzard). Speakers at the latter service included Hall of Famers Harmon Killebrew, Cal Ripken Jr. and Dave Winfield, and many former teammates and coaches.

==Career statistics==

In 24 postseason games, Puckett batted .309 (30-for-97) with 16 runs, three doubles, two triples, five home runs, 16 RBI, three stolen bases and eight walks.

<text>Conservation in Australia is an issue of state and federal policy. Australia is one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world, with a large portion of species endemic to Australia. Preserving this wealth of biodiversity is important for future generations. 25% of Australia is managed for conservation.

Animal habitats like reefs and forests must be preserved in order to preserve the population and diversity of animal species. Conservation is vital for future study and for field research to be taken, and because biological richness is an unmeasurable aesthetic that may be developed into commercial recreational attractions.

According to Janine Benyus, the potential for advances in biomimicry in Australia is great because the extreme weather and conditions found here provide an excellent evolutionary incubator. Research on natural processes can only occur if the habitat is preserved and organisms continue to thrive.
Federal and State governments manage protected areas and national parks; a number of non-governmental organizations are also involved in conservation.

==Conservation issues==
A key conservation issue is the preservation of biodiversity, especially by protecting the remaining rainforests. The destruction of habitat by human activities, including land clearing, remains the major cause of biodiversity loss in Australia. The importance of the Australian rainforests to the conservation movement is very high. Australia is the only western country to have large areas of rainforest intact. Forests provide timber, drugs, and food and should be managed to maximize the possible uses. Currently, there are a number of environmental movements and campaigners advocating for action on saving the environment, one such campaign is the Big Switch.

Land management issues including clearance of native vegetation, reafforestation of once-cleared areas, control of exotic weeds and pests, expansion of dryland salinity, and changed fire regimes. Intensification of resource use in sectors such as forestry, fisheries, and agriculture are widely reported to contribute to biodiversity loss in Australia. Habitat fragmentation is one of the most important factors affecting the persistence of species. Coastal and marine environments also have reduced biodiversity from reduced water quality caused by pollution and sediments arising from human settlements and agriculture. In central New South Wales where there are large plains of grassland, problems have arisen from—unusual to say—lack of land clearing.

Shark culling (the killing of sharks) currently occurs in New South Wales and Queensland (in government &quot;shark control&quot; programs). These programs have damaged the marine ecosystem. Roughly 50,000 sharks have been killed by Queensland authorities since 1962, including in the Great Barrier Reef. Queensland&#x27;s &quot;shark control&quot; program has been called &quot;outdated, cruel and ineffective&quot;. The &quot;shark control&quot; programs in New South Wales and Queensland have killed thousands of animals, such as turtles and dolphins. In 2018, the Humane Society International filed a lawsuit against the government of Queensland to stop shark culling in the Great Barrier Reef.

The protection of the iconic Wollemi Pine is an important conservation issue because the tree is one of the rarest in the world. There are only 46 mature individual trees remaining in the wild. The small grove of unusual conifers in a remote canyon are threatened due to its highly restricted distribution, extremely small population size, the ongoing impacts from exotic pathogens, inappropriate fire regimes, unauthorized site visitation and climate change.

Specific issues:
* Blue Gum Forest
* Fraser Island
* Franklin Dam
* Lake Pedder
* Uranium mining in Kakadu National Park
* Plight of the Murray River system

==Legal framework==
Conservation of the natural environment in Australia is derived from five different sources of law, namely international law, federal law, State law and local government law as well as the application of the common law.

===International environmental law===
International agreements that affect conservation policy in Australia.

===Federal law===
The primary federal law is the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), usually referred to as the EPBC Act.

==Protected areas==

There are numerous protected areas in all States and Territories that have been created to protect and preserve Australia&#x27;s unique ecosystems. Protected areas include national parks and other reserves, as well as 64 wetlands which are registered under the Ramsar Convention and 16 World Heritage Sites. , 10.8% () of the total land area of Australia is within a protected area. Protected marine zones have been created in many areas to preserve marine biodiversity; as of 2002 they cover about 7% () of Australia&#x27;s marine jurisdiction. In Australia forest cover is around 17% of the total land area, equivalent to 134,005,100 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 133,882,200 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 131,614,800 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 2,390,300 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 18% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 67% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 32% private ownership and 1% with ownership listed as other or unknown. 

Protected areas of include those managed by the federal Department of the Environment and Energy, and national parks and other protected areas managed by the states, Agencies responsible for protected areas include:

*Director of National Parks
*Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority
*New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change
*Parks Victoria
*Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service
*Department of Environment and Water (South Australia)
*Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)
*Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service
*Chief Minister&#x27;s Department (Australian Capital Territory)
*Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory

<text>Wisconsin&#x27;s history with the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts spans from 1910 to the present day. Both programs have independently served thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910–1950)==
In 1920, the Appleton Council, and the Neenah-Menasha Council were both formed. They merged to become the Valley Council (#635) in 1922. In 1924 Valley Council changed its name to the Fox River Valley Council (#635), changing it back to Valley in 1925. In 1920, the Fond Du Lac Council (#622) was founded, changing its name to the Badger Council (#622) in 1926. In 1919, the Manitowoc Council (#625) was formed, changing its name to the Manitowoc County Council (#625) in 1929, changing its name to the Waumegasako Council (#625) in 1940. The Waumegasako Council merged into the Bay-Lakes Council (#635) in 1973. In 1920, the Green Bay Council was founded, closing in 1922. In 1930, the Green Bay Area Council was founded again, changing its name to the Nicollet Area Council (#621) in 1934. In 1919, the Oshkosh Council (#630) was founded, changing its name to the Twin Lakes Council (#630) in 1935. In 1919, the Sheboygan County Council (#632) was founded, changing its name to the Kettle Moraine Council (#632) in 1935.

The Oconomowoc Council was formed in 1917. It disbanded in 1921. The Janesville Council was formed in 1917. It disbanded in 1917. The Sturgeon Bay Council was formed in 1918. It disbanded in 1919. The Ashland Council was formed in 1918. It disbanded in 1920.

Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation is a Boy Scouts of America property and High Adventure base located in Northern Wisconsin and serves the Scouts of the Northeast Illinois Council based in Highland Park, Illinois. Originally a logging camp, the Scouts purchased the land and first had campers in 1929. The camp is in size.

==Recent history (1950–present)==
The Bay-Lakes Council (#635) was formed in 1973 by a merger of the following councils: Badger (based in Fond du Lac), Waumegesako (based in Manitowoc), Nicolet Area (based in Green Bay), Valley (based in Menasha), Twin Lakes (based in Oshkosh), and Kettle Moraine (based in Sheboygan). The Hiawathaland Council joined in 2012.

==Boy Scouts of America in Wisconsin today==

There are seven Boy Scouts of America local councils headquartered in Wisconsin. Additionally, some adjacent councils in Illinois and Minnesota serve portions of Wisconsin. Besides these councils, some out of state councils maintain camp facilities in Wisconsin.

===Bay-Lakes Council===
The Bay-Lakes Council is headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin, and also serves Scouts in Michigan. Bay-Lakes Council #635 was formed on July 1, 1973, and is geographically one of the largest Boy Scout councils in the United States.

Bay-Lakes Council was formed in 1973 by a merger of the following councils: Badger (based in Fond du Lac), Waumegesako (based in Manitowoc), Nicolet Area (based in Green Bay), Valley (based in Menasha), Twin Lakes (based in Oshkosh), and Kettle Moraine (based in Sheboygan).

<text>Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science with close connections to mathematical logic. The word &quot;automata&quot; comes from the Greek word αὐτόματος, which means &quot;self-acting, self-willed, self-moving&quot;. An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a finite automaton (FA) or finite-state machine (FSM). The figure on the right illustrates a finite-state machine, which is a well-known type of automaton. This automaton consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows). As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function, which takes the previous state and current input symbol as its arguments.

Automata theory is closely related to formal language theory. In this context, automata are used as finite representations of formal languages that may be infinite. Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, as in the Chomsky hierarchy, which describes a nesting relationship between major classes of automata. Automata play a major role in the theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification.

==History==
The theory of abstract automata was developed in the mid-20th century in connection with finite automata. Automata theory was initially considered a branch of mathematical systems theory, studying the behavior of discrete-parameter systems. Early work in automata theory differed from previous work on systems by using abstract algebra to describe information systems rather than differential calculus to describe material systems. The theory of the finite-state transducer was developed under different names by different research communities. The earlier concept of Turing machine was also included in the discipline along with new forms of infinite-state automata, such as pushdown automata.

1956 saw the publication of &quot;Automata Studies&quot;, which collected work by scientists including Claude Shannon, W. Ross Ashby, John von Neumann, Marvin Minsky, Edward F. Moore, and Stephen Cole Kleene. With the publication of this volume, &quot;automata theory emerged as a relatively autonomous discipline&quot;. The book included Kleene&#x27;s description of the set of regular events, or regular languages, and a relatively stable measure of complexity in Turing machine programs by Shannon. 
In the same year, Noam Chomsky described the Chomsky hierarchy, a correspondence between automata and formal grammars, and Ross Ashby published &quot;An Introduction to Cybernetics&quot;, an accessible textbook explaining automata and information using basic set theory.

The study of linear bounded automata led to the Myhill–Nerode theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a formal language to be regular, and an exact count of the number of states in a minimal machine for the language. The pumping lemma for regular languages, also useful in regularity proofs, was proven in this period by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott, along with the computational equivalence of deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata. 

In the 1960s, a body of algebraic results known as &quot;structure theory&quot; or &quot;algebraic decomposition theory&quot; emerged, which dealt with the realization of sequential machines from smaller machines by interconnection. While any finite automaton can be simulated using a universal gate set, this requires that the simulating circuit contain loops of arbitrary complexity. Structure theory deals with the &quot;loop-free&quot; realizability of machines.
The theory of computational complexity also took shape in the 1960s. By the end of the decade, automata theory came to be seen as &quot;the pure mathematics of computer science&quot;.

==Automata==

What follows is a general definition of an automaton, which restricts a broader definition of a system to one viewed as acting in discrete time-steps, with its state behavior and outputs defined at each step by unchanging functions of only its state and input.

===Informal description===
An automaton &quot;runs&quot; when it is given some sequence of &quot;inputs&quot; in discrete (individual) &quot;time steps&quot; (or just &quot;steps&quot;). An automaton processes one input picked from a set of &quot;symbols&quot; or &quot;letters&quot;, which is called an &quot;input alphabet&quot;. The symbols received by the automaton as input at any step are a sequence of symbols called &quot;words&quot;. An automaton has a set of &quot;states&quot;. At each moment during a run of the automaton, the automaton is &quot;in&quot; one of its states. When the automaton receives new input, it moves to another state (or &quot;transitions&quot;) based on a &quot;transition function&quot; that takes the previous state and current input symbol as parameters. At the same time, another function called the &quot;output function&quot; produces symbols from the &quot;output alphabet&quot;, also according to the previous state and current input symbol. The automaton reads the symbols of the input word and transitions between states until the word is read completely, if it is finite in length, at which point the automaton &quot;halts&quot;. A state at which the automaton halts is called the &quot;final state&quot;.

To investigate the possible state/input/output sequences in an automaton using formal language theory, a machine can be assigned a &quot;starting state&quot; and a set of &quot;accepting states&quot;. Then, depending on whether a run starting from the starting state ends in an accepting state, the automaton can be said to &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;reject&quot; an input sequence. The set of all the words accepted by an automaton is called the &quot;language recognized by the automaton&quot;. A familiar example of a machine recognizing a language is an electronic lock, which accepts or rejects attempts to enter the correct code.

===Formal definition===

;Automaton

:An automaton can be represented formally by a quintuple formula_1, where:
:* formula_2 is a finite set of &quot;symbols&quot;, called the &quot;input alphabet&quot; of the automaton,
:* formula_3 is another finite set of symbols, called the &quot;output alphabet&quot; of the automaton,
:* formula_4 is a set of &quot;states&quot;,
:* formula_5 is the &quot;next-state function&quot; or &quot;transition function&quot; formula_6 mapping state-input pairs to successor states,
:* formula_7 is the &quot;next-output function&quot; formula_8 mapping state-input pairs to outputs.
:If formula_4 is finite, then formula_10 is a finite automaton.

;Input word
:An automaton reads a finite string of symbols formula_11, where formula_12, which is called an &quot;input word&quot;. The set of all words is denoted by formula_13.

;Run
:A sequence of states formula_14, where formula_15 such that formula_16 for formula_17, is a &quot;run&quot; of the automaton on an input formula_18 starting from state formula_19. In other words, at first the automaton is at the start state formula_19, and receives input formula_21. For formula_21 and every following formula_23 in the input string, the automaton picks the next state formula_24 according to the transition function formula_25, until the last symbol formula_26 has been read, leaving the machine in the &quot;final state&quot; of the run, formula_27. Similarly, at each step, the automaton emits an output symbol according to the output function formula_28.

:The transition function formula_5 is extended inductively into formula_30 to describe the machine&#x27;s behavior when fed whole input words. For the empty string formula_31, formula_32 for all states formula_33, and for strings formula_34 where formula_35 is the last symbol and formula_36 is the (possibly empty) rest of the string, formula_37. The output function formula_7 may be extended similarly into formula_39, which gives the complete output of the machine when run on word formula_36 from state formula_33.
;Acceptor

:In order to study an automaton with the theory of formal languages, an automaton may be considered as an &quot;acceptor&quot;, replacing the output alphabet and function formula_3 and formula_7 with 
:* formula_44, a designated &quot;start state&quot;, and
:* formula_45, a set of states of formula_4 (i.e. formula_47) called &quot;accept states&quot;. 
:This allows the following to be defined:

;Accepting word
:A word formula_48 is an &quot;accepting word&quot; for the automaton if formula_49, that is, if after consuming the whole string formula_36 the machine is in an accept state.

;Recognized language
:The language formula_51 &quot;recognized&quot; by an automaton is the set of all the words that are accepted by the automaton, formula_52.

;Recognizable languages
:The recognizable languages are the set of languages that are recognized by some automaton. For &quot;finite automata&quot; the recognizable languages are regular languages. For different types of automata, the recognizable languages are different.

==Variant definitions of automata==
Automata are defined to study useful machines under mathematical formalism. So the definition of an automaton is open to variations according to the &quot;real world machine&quot; that we want to model using the automaton. People have studied many variations of automata. The following are some popular variations in the definition of different components of automata.

;Input
* &quot;Finite input&quot;: An automaton that accepts only finite sequences of symbols. The above introductory definition only encompasses finite words.
* &quot;Infinite input&quot;: An automaton that accepts infinite words (ω-words). Such automata are called &quot;ω-automata&quot;.
* &quot;Tree input&quot;: The input may be a &quot;tree of symbols&quot; instead of sequence of symbols. In this case after reading each symbol, the automaton &quot;reads&quot; all the successor symbols in the input tree. It is said that the automaton &quot;makes one copy&quot; of itself for each successor and each such copy starts running on one of the successor symbols from the state according to the transition relation of the automaton. Such an automaton is called a tree automaton.
* &quot;Infinite tree input&quot; : The two extensions above can be combined, so the automaton reads a tree structure with (in)finite branches. Such an automaton is called an infinite tree automaton.

;States
* &quot;Single state&quot;: An automaton with one state, also called a &quot;combinational circuit&quot;, performs a transformation which may implement combinational logic.
* &quot;Finite states&quot;: An automaton that contains only a finite number of states.
* &quot;Infinite states&quot;: An automaton that may not have a finite number of states, or even a countable number of states. Different kinds of abstract memory may be used to give such machines finite descriptions.
* &quot;Stack memory&quot;: An automaton may also contain some extra memory in the form of a stack in which symbols can be pushed and popped. This kind of automaton is called a &quot;pushdown automaton&quot;.
* &quot;Queue memory&quot;: An automaton may have memory in the form of a queue. Such a machine is called &quot;queue machine&quot; and is Turing-complete.
* &quot;Tape memory&quot;: The inputs and outputs of automata are often described as input and output &quot;tapes&quot;. Some machines have additional &quot;working tapes&quot;, including the Turing machine, linear bounded automaton, and log-space transducer.

;Transition function
* &quot;Deterministic&quot;: For a given current state and an input symbol, if an automaton can only jump to one and only one state then it is a &quot;deterministic automaton&quot;.
* &quot;Nondeterministic&quot;: An automaton that, after reading an input symbol, may jump into any of a number of states, as licensed by its transition relation. The term transition function is replaced by transition relation: The automaton &quot;non-deterministically&quot; decides to jump into one of the allowed choices. Such automata are called &quot;nondeterministic automata&quot;.
* &quot;Alternation&quot;: This idea is quite similar to tree automata but orthogonal. The automaton may run its &quot;multiple copies&quot; on the &quot;same&quot; next read symbol. Such automata are called &quot;alternating automata&quot;. The acceptance condition must be satisfied on all runs of such &quot;copies&quot; to accept the input.
* &quot;Two-wayness&quot;: Automata may read their input from left to right, or they may be allowed to move back-and-forth on the input, in a way similar to a Turing machine. Automata which can move back-and-forth on the input are called two-way finite automata.

;Acceptance condition
* &quot;Acceptance of finite words&quot;: Same as described in the informal definition above.
* &quot;Acceptance of infinite words&quot;: an &quot;ω-automaton&quot; cannot have final states, as infinite words never terminate. Rather, acceptance of the word is decided by looking at the infinite sequence of visited states during the run.
* &quot;Probabilistic acceptance&quot;: An automaton need not strictly accept or reject an input. It may accept the input with some probability between zero and one. For example, quantum finite automata, geometric automata and metric automata have probabilistic acceptance.

Different combinations of the above variations produce many classes of automata.

Automata theory is a subject matter that studies properties of various types of automata. For example, the following questions are studied about a given type of automata.

* Which class of formal languages is recognizable by some type of automata? (Recognizable languages)
* Are certain automata &quot;closed&quot; under union, intersection, or complementation of formal languages? (Closure properties)
* How expressive is a type of automata in terms of recognizing a class of formal languages? And, their relative expressive power? (Language hierarchy)

Automata theory also studies the existence or nonexistence of any effective algorithms to solve problems similar to the following list:

* Does an automaton accept at least one input word? (Emptiness checking)
* Is it possible to transform a given non-deterministic automaton into a deterministic automaton without changing the language recognized? (Determinization)
* For a given formal language, what is the smallest automaton that recognizes it? (Minimization)

== Types of automata ==
The following is an incomplete list of types of automata.

===Discrete, continuous, and hybrid automata===
Normally automata theory describes the states of abstract machines but there are discrete automata, analog automata or continuous automata, or hybrid discrete-continuous automata, which use digital data, analog data or continuous time, or digital &quot;and&quot; analog data, respectively.

== Hierarchy in terms of powers ==
The following is an incomplete hierarchy in terms of powers of different types of virtual machines. The hierarchy reflects the nested categories of languages the machines are able to accept. 
== Applications ==
Each model in automata theory plays important roles in several applied areas. Finite automata are used in text processing, compilers, and hardware design. Context-free grammar (CFGs) are used in programming languages and artificial intelligence. Originally, CFGs were used in the study of human languages. Cellular automata are used in the field of artificial life, the most famous example being John Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. Some other examples which could be explained using automata theory in biology include mollusk and pine cone growth and pigmentation patterns. Going further, a theory suggesting that the whole universe is computed by some sort of a discrete automaton, is advocated by some scientists. The idea originated in the work of Konrad Zuse, and was popularized in America by Edward Fredkin. Automata also appear in the theory of finite fields: the set of irreducible polynomials that can be written as composition of degree two polynomials is in fact a regular language.
Another problem for which automata can be used is the induction of regular languages.

==Automata simulators==
Automata simulators are pedagogical tools used to teach, learn and research automata theory. An automata simulator takes as input the description of an automaton and then simulates its working for an arbitrary input string. The description of the automaton can be entered in several ways. An automaton can be defined in a symbolic language or its specification may be entered in a predesigned form or its transition diagram may be drawn by clicking and dragging the mouse. Well known automata simulators include Turing&#x27;s World, JFLAP, VAS, TAGS and SimStudio.

==Category-theoretic models==
One can define several distinct categories of automata following the automata classification into different types described in the previous section. The mathematical category of deterministic automata, sequential machines or &quot;sequential automata&quot;, and Turing machines with &quot;automata homomorphisms&quot; defining the arrows between automata is a Cartesian closed category, it has both categorical limits and colimits. An automata homomorphism maps a quintuple of an automaton &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; onto the quintuple of another automaton 
&quot; A&quot;&quot;j&quot;. Automata homomorphisms can also be considered as &quot;automata transformations&quot; or as semigroup homomorphisms, when the state space, S, of the automaton is defined as a semigroup Sg. Monoids are also considered as a suitable setting for automata in monoidal categories.

;Categories of variable automata
One could also define a &quot;variable automaton&quot;, in the sense of Norbert Wiener in his book on &quot;The Human Use of Human Beings&quot; &quot;via&quot; the endomorphisms formula_53. Then one can show that such variable automata homomorphisms form a mathematical group. In the case of non-deterministic, or other complex kinds of automata, the latter set of endomorphisms may become, however, a &quot;variable automaton groupoid&quot;. Therefore, in the most general case, categories of variable automata of any kind are categories of groupoids or groupoid categories. Moreover, the category of reversible automata is then a 
2-category, and also a subcategory of the 2-category of groupoids, or the groupoid category.

<doc id="103357" wikidata="Q5162975" url="?curid=103357" title="Conservation in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>Conservation in the Republic of Ireland is overseen by a number of statutory and non-governmental agencies, including those with responsibility for conservation of the built environment and conservation of the natural environment in Ireland. Conservation has sometimes been a contentious issue, with debates impacting its progress since the 1960s. Concrete initiatives are sometimes driven by European Union (EU) heritage protection and environmental policies, including EU environmental law, which – as a member – the Irish government is obliged to adopt and implement.

== Heritage conservation ==
Heritage conservation has been in place in Ireland since the formation as the state, with structures protected under local, national and international legislation.

===National legislation===

In the 1930s, a national policy was adopted in the form of the National Monuments Act, which established preservation orders, listed national monuments, and outlined standards, prohibitions, and regulations of archaeological objects. The National Monuments Service, an agency of the Office of Public Works, is responsible for National Monuments. As of 2020, the National Monuments Service had responsibility for the conservation of approximately 1,000 individual structures at over 760 different sites.

===Local legislation===
The Planning and Development Act 2000 establishes that each regional planning authority (administered by county and city councils in Ireland) is responsible for maintaining a Record of Protected Structures. These structures may be protected for conservation from an architectural, historical, archaeological, cultural, social or technical perspective. Owners or occupiers of a listed protected structure are obliged to prevent the structure from becoming endangered through damage or through neglect. As of 2020, the various Records of Protected Structures contained over 40,000 structures nationally.

===International conventions===
Ireland has been a member of UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, since 1961. As of 2020, there are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Republic of Ireland. These structures are in the Brú na Bóinne complex in County Meath and on Skellig Michael in County Kerry.

===Non-government agencies===
A number of non-government and voluntary organisations (including An Taisce (the National Trust for Ireland), the Dublin Civic Trust, the Irish Landmark Trust, and the Mining Heritage Trust of Ireland) undertake architectural conservation projects on a non-statutory basis.

== Environmental conservation ==
===Statutory protections===

One of the earliest environmental conservation initiatives in Ireland involved the hosting of an international wildlife seminar in 1970, which was part of its contribution to the European Conservation Year. This seminar played a role in the creation of the Forest and Wildlife Service, which was created in response to the seminar&#x27;s recommendation for a centralized conservation agency in Northern Ireland. One of the primary functions of the agency involves the identification of sites for conservation purposes. 

As of the 21st century, government agencies with responsibility for the protection and conservation of the natural environment include the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Parks and Wildlife Service. The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963 also affords some responsibility for environmental protection to local authorities in Ireland, who can control development in areas &quot;outstanding natural beauty and/or special recreational value&quot; by designating them a &quot;Special Amenity Area&quot;.

===Voluntary organisations===
Voluntary and non-governmental agencies undertaking environmental conservation projects in Ireland include the Bilberry Goat Trust, Irish Peatland Conservation Council, and Native Woodland Trust. A number of these organisations are members of the Irish Environmental Network.

<doc id="103359" wikidata="Q7438565" url="?curid=103359" title="Scouting in Michigan">
<text>Scouting in Michigan has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Beginning years (1910–1950)==

The YMCA in Michigan was organizing Scout troops based on &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; as early as 1909.

In 1910 the first scout troop in West Michigan, Rockford Troop 1 was formed by Merritt Lamb. Shortly after the formation of Rockford Troop 1, Merritt formed Muskegon Troop 1 and the Muskegon Council. Merritt Lamb was the 13th Eagle Scout in the nation, and the first person in Michigan to receive the Bronze Cross for Lifesaving.

The Michigan Forest Scouts were formed by the State of Michigan in 1911. This group was formed in response to a number of late 19th century and early 20th century forest fires, and were effectively &quot;auxiliary fire wardens&quot;.

In 1914, St. Stanislaus Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Troop No. 1 obtained its charter as the first organized troop in Bay City Michigan and the first admitted to the Bay City Council (chartered in 1917). Scout activities had been going on for several years prior to this. Father Ladislaus P. Krakowski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka, and his assistant Father Frank Kozak encouraged the official link, per the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church Centennial 1874-1974 book of 1974.

The Forest Scouts crested at 5,000 members and ended in 1916.

In 1929, a group of 8 Eagle Scouts including Gerald R. Ford participate in the first Mackinac Island Honor Guard.

In 1933, the National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meeting was held at the Owasippe Scout Camps outside Whitehall, Michigan.

In 1950, the Gerber baby food company donated the funds to purchase Gerber Scout Reservation (now of the Michigan Crossroads Council) to BSA.

===Mackinac Island Honor Guard Program===
The Mackinac Island Governor&#x27;s Honor Guard (Mackinac Island Honor Scouts) program is one of the few elite programs of its kind. Starting in 1929, a select group of eight Eagle Scouts from across the state, including young Gerald Ford, to serve as honor guards in Fort Mackinac. In 1934, as a Civilian Conservation Corps project, Scout Barracks were built just outside the fort walls. The service camp has been known by many names. Originally, it was named to honor the Governor of Michigan at the time. It was also known as the Mackinac Island Eagle Scout Honor Guard until it was opened up to scouts of all ranks. In 1974, the program was expanded to include Girl Scouts. Similar programs are the Utah National Parks Council Honor Guard and Greater Niagara Frontier Council Honor Guard.

The program is popular, selective, and a long-standing tradition. Scouts raise and lower twenty-six flags on the island, serve as guides, and complete volunteer service projects during their stay. Duties on the island include raising and lowering flags each day, serving downtown and in Fort Mackinac as guides, and doing a variety of service projects to better Mackinac Island State Park.

A unique tie that Scouting has with Mackinac Island can be seen overlooking the Mackinac Island harbor. The Mackinac Island Statue of Liberty replica was dedicated in 1950 by the Boy Scouts of America. The statue is one of 200 donated by the BSA in 1950 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Scouting. The program was called Strengthen the Arm of Liberty and the Mackinac statue is the only one located in Michigan. Due to the unique role that BSA Scouts play on Mackinac Island during the summer, the statue is a lasting testament to the island’s scouting heritage. The statue was restored by the Mackinac Island American Legion in 2013 and was rededicated on July 4, 2014.

Between Memorial Day and Labor day, the island is the summer home to 14 scout troops. Of the six Girl Scout troops, one is from Michigan Shore to Shore Council, two from Heart of Michigan Council, and three from Southeastern Michigan Council. Of the eight BSA councils, Bay-Lakes Council, Southern Shores Field Service Council, and Great Lakes Field Service Council all provide one troop, President Gerald R. Ford Field Service Council is home to two units, while Water and Woods Field Service Council has three honor troops.

==Middle years (1950–1990)==
The Bass Lake lone troop Scout camp was part of the Owasippe Scout Reservation operated by the Chicago Area Council. The Bass Lake camp was a single camp on a small (approximately wide) lake in the Owasippe reservation. A single troop would take over the entire camp, usually for a two-week period, preparing all their own food and overseeing all aspects of the camp life. Active in the 1950s and 1960s, Bass Lake camp is no longer in use.

International Girl Scouts of the USA gatherings named Senior Roundups were held every three years from 1956 until 1965. The first one was held at Milford, Michigan in 1956, attended by 5,000 girls.
As the scouting program grew across the state, local councils began to be consolidated into larger councils to manage the increased number of scouts and units. By the end of the 20th century, Michigan was home to 14 Boy Scout councils and 14 Girl Scout Councils.

The 1986 National Order of the Arrow Conference was held at Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant.

==Recent history (2000–present)==
The 2006 and 2012 National Order of the Arrow conferences (NOACs) were held at Michigan State University in East Lansing. The host lodge in 2006 was Gabe-shi-win-gi-ji-kens Lodge #374. 8,003 Arrowmen from around the country came by plane, train, and bus to participate in the Order&#x27;s 2006 NOAC; Over 600 people from the state of Michigan were present during the 5 day event.

At the beginning of 2010, there were 12 Boy Scout Councils and 14 Girl Scout Councils in Michigan. In 2008, many Girl Scout Councils were merged in the state, resulting in the 5 present day Girl Scouts councils. In 2012, the Boy Scouts of America consolidated nine of its councils across the state into the Michigan Crossroads Council.

In 2020, Michigan Crossroads Council made a decision to merge their Field Service Councils to create one central Council.

==Boy Scouts of America==
===Michigan Crossroads Council===

Due to a population decline in the 2000s, with a corresponding loss in youth members, the Boy Scouts of America decided that Michigan&#x27;s councils should consolidate to help save costs and raise membership. In October 2010, the Area 2 Project was launched to develop a sustainable origination for the 21st Century. In 2012 the Area 2 project committee presented a &quot;Crossroads Recommendation&quot; to the Central Region. As a result of the recommendation, nine councils were merged into the Michigan Crossroads Council, which was then divided into four field service councils.

* Great Lakes Field Service Council serves Scouts in Metro Detroit.
* President Gerald R. Ford Field Service Council serves Scouts in western and northern Michigan.
* Southern Shores Field Service Council serves Scouts in Southern Michigan.
* Water &amp; Woods Field Service Council serves Scouts in eastern and central Michigan.
In 2020, Michigan Crossroads Council made a decision to merge their Field Service Councils to create one central Council.

===Bay-Lakes Council===
The Bay-Lakes Council is headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin, and also serves Scouts in Michigan. It is merged with Hiawathaland Council, retaining the Bay-Lakes name.

Camp Hiawatha was opened in 1967 on property formally known as Wolfe&#x27;s Lodge. There were several small cabins and a larger lodge on the &quot;family side&quot; and little else. The &quot;camp side&quot; was nothing but trees, brush and ferns as tall at the campers. The first campers that summer faced a real challenge. No electricity, telephones, running water and very little shelter.

Today Camp Hiawatha is and encircles Bunting Lake, a lake in the middle of Hiawathaland National Forest in the heart of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The closest towns are Chatham and Munising, Michigan.

Camp Hiawatha is now under the administration of Bay-Lakes Council, becoming Bay-Lakes&#x27; third Scouts BSA resident camp, joining Bear Paw Scout Camp and Gardner Dam Camps, and fifth overall resident camp, joining Cub Scout World Camp Rokilio and Twin Lakes Webelos Resident Camp.

<doc id="103360" wikidata="Q182276" url="?curid=103360" title="Benito Juárez">
<text>Benito Pablo Juárez García (; 21 March 1806 – 18 July 1872) was a Mexican politician, military commander, and lawyer who served as the 26th president of Mexico from 1858 until his death in office in 1872. A Zapotec, he was the first Indigenous president of Mexico and the first democratically elected Indigenous president in the postcolonial Americas. A member of the Liberal Party, he previously held a number of offices, including the governorship of Oaxaca and the presidency of the Supreme Court. During his presidency, he led the Liberals to victory in the Reform War and in the Second French intervention in Mexico.

Born in Oaxaca to a poor rural Indigenous family and orphaned as a child, Juárez passed into the care of his uncle, eventually moving to Oaxaca City at the age of 12, where he found work as a domestic servant. Sponsored by his employer, who was also a lay Franciscan, Juárez temporarily enrolled in a seminary and studied to become a priest, but he later switched his studies to law at the Institute of Sciences and Arts, where he became active in liberal politics. He began to practice law and was eventually appointed as a judge, after which he married Margarita Maza, a woman from a socially distinguished family in Oaxaca City.

Juárez was eventually elected Governor of Oaxaca and became involved in national politics after the ousting of Antonio López de Santa Anna in the Plan of Ayutla. Juárez was made Minister of Justice under the new Liberal president Juan Álvarez. He was instrumental in passing the Juárez Law as part of the broader program of constitutional reforms known as &quot;La Reforma&quot; (The Reform). Later, as the head of the Supreme Court, he succeeded to the presidency upon the resignation of the Liberal president Ignacio Comonfort in the early weeks of the Reform War between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, and led the Liberal Party to victory after three years of warfare.

Almost immediately after the Reform War had ended, President Juárez was faced with a French invasion, the Second French Intervention aimed at overthrowing the government of the Mexican Republic and replacing it with a French-aligned monarchy, the Second Mexican Empire. The French soon gained the collaboration of the Conservative Party who aimed at returning themselves to power after their defeat in the Reform War, but Juárez continued to lead the government and armed forces of the Mexican Republic, even as he was forced by the advances of the French to flee to the north of the country. The Second Mexican Empire would finally collapse in 1867 after the departure of the last French troops two months previously and President Juárez returned to Mexico City where he continued as president until his death due to a heart attack in 1872, but with growing opposition from fellow Liberals who believed he was becoming autocratic.

During his presidency, he supported many controversial measures, including his negotiation of the McLane–Ocampo Treaty, which would have granted the United States perpetual extraterritorial rights across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; a decree extending his presidential term for the duration of French Intervention; his proposal to revise the liberal Constitution of 1857 to strengthen the power of the federal government; and his decision to run for reelection in 1871. His opponent, liberal general, and fellow Oaxacan Porfirio Díaz opposed his re-election and rebelled against Juárez in the Plan de la Noria.

After his death, the city of Oaxaca added &quot;de Juárez&quot; to its name in his honor, and numerous other places and institutions have been named after him. He is the only individual whose birthday (21 March) is celebrated as a national public and patriotic holiday in Mexico. Many cities (most notably Ciudad Juárez), streets, institutions, and other locations are named after him. He is considered the most popular Mexican president of the 19th century.

==Early life and education==

Benito Juárez was born on 21 March 1806, in the village of San Pablo Guelatao, Oaxaca, located in the mountain range since named for him, the Sierra Juárez. It was a small settlement of about two hundred inhabitants, made up of straw huts, and a small church, the village being located at the edge of a mountain pond known for its picturesque transparent waters, and called &quot;La Laguna Encantada&quot;, the enchanted pond.

His parents, Brígida García and Marcelino Juárez were Zapotec peasants. He described his parents as &quot;Indians from the primitive race of the country&quot; (). He had two older sisters, Josefa and Rosa. Juárez became an orphan at the age of 3. His grandparents also died shortly after, and Juárez was raised by his uncle Bernardino Juárez.

Juárez worked in the cornfields and as a shepherd until the age of 12. Up until then Juárez had also been illiterate and could not speak Spanish knowing then only his first language, Zapotec. However, his sister had previously moved to the city of Oaxaca for work, and that year Juárez moved to the city to attend school. There he took a job as a domestic servant in the household of Antonio Maza, where his sister worked as a cook.

In 1818, while the Mexican War of Independence was ongoing, a 12-year-old Juárez entered domestic service under the lay Franciscan and bookbinder Antonio Salanueva. The young boy showed potential at primary school, upon which Salanueva sought to sponsor Juárez to enter a seminary to study for the priesthood.

Juárez entered the seminary in Spring of 1821, only a few months before Mexico won its independence in September of the same year. He continued his theological studies for six years but eventually decided that he was not interested in the priesthood. An Institute of Arts and Sciences had been founded by the Oaxacan state legislature in 1826, and Juárez transferred there in 1827. In 1829, Juárez was appointed a teacher of physics. In 1831, Juárez accepted the post of , or judicial secretary to the municipal council of Oaxaca City. In 1832, he graduated from the Institute of Arts and Sciences with a law degree. He was eventually admitted to the bar on 13 January 1834.

==Early political career==
===Legal career===
From the very beginning of his legal career, Juárez became an active partisan of the Liberal Party. As a lawyer, Juárez took cases of Indigenous villagers. Community members of Loxicha, Oaxaca hired him for their denunciation of a priest, whom they accused of abuses. He did not win the case, and was thrown into jail along with community members, &quot;thanks to the collusion between Church and the state,&quot; writing later that it &quot;strengthened in me the goal of working constantly to destroy the pernicious power of the privileged classes.&quot; Juárez gained the goal of fighting for equality before the law in the face of the lingering legal privileges that remained in Mexico from the colonial legal system, as were accorded to the Mexican Catholic Church, the army, and Indigenous communities. He became a prosecutor for the State of Oaxaca and was soon elected to the Oaxaca state legislature in 1832, serving for two years during the Liberal presidency of Valentin Gomez Farias.

A Conservative Party coup led by Santa Anna overthrew the presidency of Gomez Farias in 1834. As part of the constitutional reorganization involved in the subsequent transition from the First Mexican Republic to the Centralist Republic of Mexico, Oaxaca became a department controlled by Mexico City and the state legislature of Oaxaca was dissolved. Juárez protested the dissolution of local government that was being imposed upon Oaxaca, and in fact, the rest of Mexico, as part of the transition to the Centralist Republic of Mexico in which the states of the nation were replaced by departments directly administered by Mexico City. For this, Juárez was briefly imprisoned, but he was shortly released. Juárez then returned to private practice. After practicing law for several years. In 1842 Liberal governor of Oaxaca Antonio León, appointed Juárez to serve as a Civil and Revenue Judge for the state of Oaxaca, a position which he held until 1846.

===Governor of Oaxaca===
The Centralist Republic itself would be overthrown in 1846 at the beginning of the Mexican American War, and Oaxaca regained its federal autonomy, its executive now led by a triumvirate which included Juárez. He was subsequently elected to the national congress as a deputy for Oaxaca. Juárez supported President Valentín Gómez Farías, who had returned to power. There was a revolt against the state of Oaxaca during this time, causing Juárez to abandon his congressional post and return to Oaxaca to try and maintain order.

In November, 1847, he assumed the governorship. When Santa Anna fell from power disgraced by his loss in the Mexican-American War, Governor Juárez did not allow the ex-president to establish himself in Oaxaca, which gained for him the future enmity of Santa Anna. Juárez was faced with chaos in the state finances, the state justice department, and the state police organization. Juárez proceeded to carry out a program of economic improvements which included an elimination of the state deficit, the construction of roads and bridges, and the development of education. Governor Juárez also prepared and published a Civil and Penal Code. Oaxaca became a model state, and Juárez’ gained fame as an able administrator throughout the nation.

Upon finishing his one term permitted by the state constitution, Juárez became the director of the Oaxaca Institute of Science and Arts where he had previously studied law and also taught science. Juárez also continued his practice of law.

===Exile in New Orleans===
Mexico experienced relative peace and stability in the years immediately following the conclusion of the Mexican-American War, through the moderate presidencies of José Joaquín de Herrera and Mariano Arista but in 1852 a Conservative coup overthrew Arista, and brought back Santa Anna for what would end up being his final dictatorship.

Juárez fell victim to the restored Santa Anna, and the authorities confined him to the fortress of San Juan de Ullua. He was eventually released and exiled to Havana, from which he then traveled to New Orleans. There he found a day job as a cigar maker in one of the city&#x27;s factories, while his wife remained in Mexico with their children, and were looked after by Liberal partisans. His time as governor of Oaxaca had not left him with a vast fortune, and he survived off of his cigar rolling job and funds sent to him from Mexico by his wife.

Juárez met other Liberal exiles in New Orleans including the anti-clerical former governor of Michoacan Melchor Ocampo, and the Cuban separatist exile, , who later married Juárez&#x27;s oldest daughter, and served as a valuable ally during the Reform War and the second French intervention

As the Liberal Plan of Ayutla broke out against Santa Anna in March of 1855, Juárez sought to return to Mexico. He arrived at the port of Acapulco near the Southern center of the revolt in the summer of 1855. Santa Anna fled the nation and a subsequent Liberal assembly elected Juan Alvarez as the new president. Juárez, who had been secretary to the assembly was made Minister of Justice and Religion.

===La Reforma===

The Plan of Ayutla had inaugurated what would come to be known as &quot;La Reforma&quot;, a period of unprecedented constitutional change for Mexico, and Juárez was to be a key figure throughout this era. Before &quot;La Reforma&quot;, and dating back to the legal system of New Spain, neither clerics nor soldiers were under the jurisdiction of the civil judiciary, and could only be tried for all offenses under their own respective, independent court systems.

It was the aim of the Liberal Party to abolish all such sovereign court systems and bring all offenses under the jurisdiction of the state. This was done through the &quot;Ley Juárez&quot;, named for the Minister of Justice, and promulgated under the presidency of Alvarez. The law would remain on the books, but President Alvarez resigned in December 1855, amid increasing opposition to his administration, passing over the presidency to the more moderate Liberal Ignacio Comonfort, whom it was hoped could more effectively pass progressive reforms.

Juárez did not continue as Minister of Justice, and spent the pivotal year of 1856, peacefully retired in Oaxaca, although continuing to correspond with his Liberal allies in Mexico City as they continued their aims in furthering &quot;La Reforma&quot;. Juárez personally lobbied for a measure expelling the Jesuits from Mexico which was passed in June, 1856.Meanwhile, the Mexican Congress was drafting a new Constitution which integrated into itself the Ley Juárez along with the &quot;Ley Lerdo&quot;, which with the aim of selling them off to stimulate economic development, had nationalized most of the Catholic Church&#x27;s properties, along with the communal properties of Mexico&#x27;s Indigenous communities. The new constitution which would come to be known as the Constitution of 1857, was promulgated on 5 February 1857, with the aim of coming into effect on Mexican Independence Day, 16 September of that year. It had abandoned Roman Catholicism as the state religion, and aimed to establish religious freedom, freedom of association, civil rights, the abolition of monopolies, and the abolition of hereditary privileges.

As opposition to the Constitution of 1857 threatened civil war, Comonfort&#x27;s ministers resigned on 20 October 1857, and among the replacements was Juárez who was appointed as Secretary of Home Affairs (&quot;Secretario de Gobernacion&quot;), and was made Chairman of the Council of Ministers. When, one month later, Comonfort was formally elected as the first president under the new constitution, Juárez was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

==Reform War==
===Flight from the capital===
In the face of increasing opposition however and with civil conflict already erupting in the state of Puebla, the moderate President Comonfort sought to distance himself from the Constitution of 1857 and by December was already announcing that the Constitution ought to be reformed. Chief Justice Juárez rebuffed Comonfort&#x27;s invitation to join him in abandoning the constitution. On 17 December, Conservatives led by Felix Zuloaga proclaimed the Plan of Tacubaya, which dissolved congress and invited Comonfort to accept the presidency with extraordinary powers in a self-coup. Comonfort &quot;felt that by temporarily assuming dictatorial powers he could hold the extremists on both sides in check and pursue a middle course, always his object. It soon became obvious that such an assumption was merely wishful thinking.&quot; Comonfort accepted and had Juárez imprisoned in the capital.

Comonfort however had blundered in overestimating the support he could expect among the state governors. The strategic port state of Veracruz disowned the Plan of Tacubaya, and Comonfort realized that the country had begun to fragment into civil war. This was much more than he had intended, and he began to back away from the Conservatives. Juárez was released from prison on 11 January 1858, shortly before Comonfort himself left the country, the presidency thus passing over to Juárez who as Chief Justice was next in line to succeed the presidency. Meanwhile, the Conservatives elected Zuloaga as their president.

As Mexico City fell into the hands of the Conservatives, President Juárez transferred himself to Guanajuato City, where on 19 January, he assembled his cabinet and vowed to defend the Constitution through war if necessary. The states of Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Durango, Jalisco, Tabasco, San Luis Potosi, Oaxaca, Guanajuato, and Veracruz proclaimed their loyalty to the Juárez government.

The first year of the Reform War as it would come to be known, was marked by repeated Conservative victories, albeit indecisive ones. On 10 March 1858, the Liberals lost the Battle of Salamanca, near Juárez’ base in Guanajuato City, upon which he and his government retreated to Guadalajara. While the Liberal government was ensconced there, the garrison mutinied against them, and Juárez along with his ministers which included Melchor Ocampo and Guillermo Prieto were imprisoned. The commander of the garrison, Colonel Landa, was far from having effective control over the entire city. Landa offered Juárez his liberty if he would order the remaining Liberal troops in Guadalajara to surrender. Juárez refused and Landa responded by ordering his troops to shoot the prisoners.

Guillermo Prieto intervened, and the soldiers hesitated. Landa did not repeat his orders, and it was at this point that a Liberal body of troops under Miguel Cruz de Aedo arrived in order to negotiate. Landa was allowed to leave Guadalajara, and the Liberal prisoners were released as well.

Juárez and his cabinet now made their way to the port of Manzanillo from which they embarked for the Liberal stronghold of Veracruz by way of Panama. On 4 May 1858, Juárez arrived in Veracruz where the government of Manuel Gutiérrez Zamora was stationed with General Ignacio de la Llave. Upon his arrival Juárez was joined by his wife and greeted with enthusiasm by the population.

===Veracruz===
One of Juárez&#x27;s first challenges in the new capital was meeting French and English claims over loans that had been forced upon English and French merchants by the Liberal General Garza. Juárez warded off the threat of military intervention by recognizing the legitimacy of the claims.

The Conservatives meanwhile were suffering infighting, and after a series of victories, General Miguel Miramon became the new Conservative president in December 1858. President Miramon gathered an army and prepared a siege of Veracruz.

On 29 December 1858, President Juárez called upon the inhabitants of Veracruz to prepare for an attack by collecting arms, provisions, and organizing fortifications. The first Conservative siege of Veracruz failed in March, 1859.

Meanwhile, the Liberal armies were making advances upon Mexico City. General Degollado occupied the suburbs of Mexico City throughout February and March of 1859, only to be repulsed by the efforts of the Conservative General Marquez, who then gained infamy for shooting all of his prisoners of war in the suburb of Tacubaya.

Juárez remained entrenched in Vera Cruz. In the course of the war through 1859, the Liberals captured Mazatlan and Colima. By April, the United States had recognized the Liberal government as the legitimate government of Mexico and sent Robert Milligan McLane as its official representative.

On 7 July 1859, Juárez laid out an agenda of legislation decreeing the &quot;de jure&quot; separation of church and state, the greater independence of the judiciary, the expansion of affordable education, a program of road construction, a program of railroad construction, financial reform, the reduction of duties, the encouragement of foreign commerce, the subdivision of great estates to encourage peasant proprietorship, and the encouragement of immigration.

On 12 July, a series of anti-clerical laws were passed adding upon those that had already been implemented as part of the Constitution of 1857. The properties of the Catholic Church were almost entirely nationalized, the responsibility of carrying out marriages was completely removed from the Catholic Church and was declared to be a purely civil contract, and the registration of births and deaths was also removed from the Church and handed over to the state. Furthermore, monasteries were dissolved although nunneries were allowed to remain with the condition that they accept no more novices.

===McLane-Ocampo Treaty===
The U.S. at this time was seeking a route for transit from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean, and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec was the narrowest crossing in Mexico between the bodies of water. Juárez needing allies against the Conservatives, and his government proceeded to negotiate and ratify the McLane-Ocampo Treaty by December 1859. The treaty would have granted the United States perpetual extraterritorial rights for its citizens and its military through key strategic routes in Mexico. The treaty however, ultimately was rejected by the United States Senate.

The American recognition of the Juárez government at Veracruz also led the United States to defend it against another one of Miramon&#x27;s siege attempts. Towards the end of 1859, the Conservative government commissioned two gun boats to depart from Cuba and attack Veracruz while Miramon attacked from the land, but they were seized by the U.S. Navy as pirates.

===Liberal victory===
The year 1860 was one of increasing Liberal victories and Miramon once again indecisively attacked Veracruz in March. In September, the Juárez government suffered a scandal when the Liberal General Santos Degollado raided a mule train of money being sent to European merchants. Juárez made efforts to recover the money and gave orders for restitution.

As an inevitable Liberal victory approached, Juárez issued a decree on 6 November 1860, fixing the date of presidential and congressional elections for the following January, with the newly elected congress scheduled to meet on 19 February.

After Guadalajara was captured on 20 December 1860, the Liberal armies had an unrestricted path back towards Mexico City. Liberal troops entered the capital on Christmas Day 1860 without encountering any military Conservative resistance.

==Interbellum presidency==
Juárez won the elections of 1861 with a large majority over his only rival General Jesús González Ortega. Juárez passed an amnesty towards the Conservatives who had fought against him during the Reform War with certain exceptions including leading generals and clergy.

The former Conservative president Miramon had fled the country, but certain Conservative Generals remained at large in the countryside including Leonardo Marquez and Tomás Mejía Camacho. Melchor Ocampo, one of the leading Liberals during the Reform War was assassinated by Marquez on 17 June 1861. Ocampo&#x27;s assassination led to severe outrage in the capital. Many Conservatives were arrested and faced deadly retaliation, but Juárez intervened on their behalf.
Santos Degollado, who had been dismissed from his military command, requested permission from congress to pursue Ocampo&#x27;s killers. He too was killed by the guerrillas on 15 June, and his command was handed over to González Ortega. Conservative General Leonardo Márquez took refuge in the Sierra Gorda of Querétaro.

In the wake of the Reform War and the demobilization of combatants, Juárez established the Rural Guard or &quot;Rurales&quot;, aimed at enforcing public security, particularly as banditry and rural unrest grew. Many brigands and bandits had allied themselves with the Liberals during the Reform War and returned to banditry after the war&#x27;s end.

The reconstruction of the country also involved a reorganization of finances, but for the time being the Mexican government found it impossible to meet its domestic and its foreign obligations. A British Minister Plenipotentiary, Sir Charles Wyke, was commissioned on 30 March 1861, to negotiate British claims while providing reassurance that the British government aimed to respect Mexican sovereignty and maintain cordial relations between both countries. On 27 May, Wyke met with the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs Zarco, with the latter attempting to convince Wyke of the impossibility for Mexico to meet its current foreign debts.

On 3 June, President Juárez issued a decree, under the authority of congress postponing all payments to foreign creditors for one year. Events were now set in motion which would culminate in the Second French Intervention in Mexico, and the failed efforts of the Second French Empire to overthrow the government of the Mexican Republic and impose a monarchy upon the nation.

The main French pretext for subsequently invading Mexico had been specifically the issue of the Jecker Bonds, a series of high interest loans which had been contracted through a Swiss banker named Jecker, by the Conservative government during the Reform War. When the government of Juárez refused to honor the debts contracted by the Conservative government, Jecker took his complaints to the government of France.

The issue of monarchy came about through the efforts of certain Mexican monarchist exiles acting independently of the Mexican government. Monarchism in Mexico had been reduced to irrelevance after the fall of the extremely short lived First Mexican Empire in 1823. When José María Gutiérrez de Estrada had attempted to revive the issue by proposing a monarchy for the country in 1840, he was driven out of the country by public outrage, which included condemnation from both the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party.

Rejected by his own country, Estrada sought support for his monarchical project abroad, gaining the aid of the Mexican diplomat José Manuel Hidalgo y Esnaurrízar, who personally knew Empress Eugenie of France, and had won her over to the idea of a Mexican monarchy as early as 1857 Eugenie was enthusiastic about the effort to establish a monarchy in Mexico, but Napoleon III was skeptical, afraid of offending the United States through the violation of the Monroe Doctrine. This concern was rendered null by the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1859, and President Juárez’ 1861 decree suspending foreign debts, gave France a pretext to send troops to Mexico. Napoleon III saw an advantage in establishing a client state on the American continent which could also serve as a buffer state to United States expansionism.

For the meantime, however Napoleon III, kept his full aims hidden. Mexican negotiations with Wykes had broken down and the minister wrote back to London advocating that the British Navy make a show of force. London and Paris began to make arrangements over the matter, and soon invited the government of Spain which had also been affected by the President Juárez’ suspension of debts. On 31 October 1861, the Convention of London was signed between France, Great Britain, and Spain, formalizing plans to militarily intervene in Mexico for the purposes of arranging its debt payments.

==Second French intervention==
===First French advance===
Foreign Minister Manuel Doblado invited the commissioners to travel to Orizaba and there the three powers proceeded to officially recognized the government of Juárez along with Mexican sovereignty. On 9 April 1862, agreements at Orizaba between the allies broke down, as France made it increasingly clear that it intended to violate Mexican sovereignty in violation of previous agreements. The British informed the Mexican government that they now intended to exit the country, and an arrangement was made with the British government to settle its claims. Spain also agreed to evacuate the country.

Minister Doblado on 11 April 1862, made it known to the French government that its intentions were leading to war. Armed conflict finally broke out as French forces attempted to head for Mexico City. On 5 May 1862, Mexican forces commanded by Ignacio Zaragoza and future president of Mexico, Porfirio Díaz repulsed the French at the Battle of Puebla while the latter were trying to ascend the hill towards the fortified positions of the city. The French retreated to Orizaba to await reinforcements. On 27 October 1862, congress granted President Juárez emergency powers to meet the needs of the ongoing invasion.

Meanwhile, the French increasingly gained the collaboration of Conservative Party generals who remained in the Mexican countryside in the wake of the Reform War. Monarchism had died out in Mexico by the time the French intervention began and the Conservative Party was initially reluctant to join the French in establishing a monarchy. The Spanish General Juan Prim, who had been part of the joint expedition would report to his government that there had been no monarchists in Mexico. The Conservatives would eventually be won over as they opportunistically sought the military aid to return themselves to power after their loss in the Reform War.

===Fall of Mexico City===
Napoleon III sent reinforcements of 30,000 troops under the command of General Forey. Forey reached Orizaba on 24 October 1862, and began planning another siege of Puebla, the defense of which had now passed on to Jesús González Ortega after General Zaragoza had died of typhoid fever on 8 September. Mexican forces were forced to surrender on 17 May 1863.

Upon hearing of the fall of Puebla, President Juárez prepared to evacuate the capital and move the republican government to San Luis Potosi. Congress closed its session on 31 May, after once again granting President Juárez emergency powers. The French entered the capital on 10 June 1863.

The French established press censorship over all of the territory they controlled and also set up courts-martial staffed by French officers which were given authority over Mexicans. Dubois de Saligny, Napoleon&#x27;s representative, selected and appointed a &quot;Junta Superior&quot; of collaborating Mexicans meant to serve as a puppet government to rubber-stamp French intentions of establishing a monarchy. Saligny and Forey themselves were present at the session of the so-called &quot;Assembly of Notables&quot;, whose motions had been prearranged by the French. On 8 July 1863, the Assembly resolved upon changing the nation into a monarchy, inviting Ferdinand Maximilian of Habsburg, to become Emperor of Mexico.

===French advance in Central Mexico===
On 9 June 1862, Juárez had arrived at San Luis Potosí and dispatches were sent to state governors in the parts of the country that were not yet occupied. French control continued to be centered upon Mexico City and Veracruz, although most major Mexican ports and their customs revenue had fallen into French hands. In August, Saligny and Forey were recalled to France, and command over French administration and the military of the conquered Mexican territories fell upon General François Achille Bazaine, already present in Mexico, who officially assumed his post on 1 October 1862.

Against the French, Juárez still commanded five divisions throughout the country, under ex president Ignacio Comonfort, who had been made Minister of War. Nonetheless, throughout the rest of the year, the French gradually expanded out of their main Mexico City -Veracruz corridor to eventually encompass much of central Mexico, while the commanders of the Republic began to wage a campaign of guerrilla warfare. Minister of War Comonfort was killed in an ambush on 14 November and was succeeded as Commander in Chief by General José López Uraga. By December, President Juárez was forced to evacuate San Luis Potosi to set up a new capital at Saltillo.

The ongoing Republican counterattack was generally a failure, except for the Southern campaign of Porfirio Díaz. With an army of 3000 men, he swept South through French lines and entrenched himself in the state of Oaxaca, becoming the military commander of all of Mexico south of the French controlled areas. From his base in Oaxaca he fought off French advances into Chiapas, and commanded incursions into the state of Vera Cruz. By January, 1864, however, the French through a naval attack had made inroads into Yucatán, capturing the city of Campeche.

===Escape to the north===
In early 1864, Juárez faced opposition from Manuel Doblado and Jesús González Ortega, who accused him of taking autocratic actions that were against the constitution. Juárez defended himself by appealing to necessity, and the opposition was defused. On 29 March, Juárez established his new capital in Monterrey after having faced the mutiny of Governor Santiago Vidaurri, who had declared his loyalty to the French, but was then defeated by Republican forces and fled into Texas.

By May 1864, the Republican military situation in the north was weak, but Juárez there still had 12,000 men under his command, access to considerable customs revenue, and a steady flow of arms from the United States. The Mexican Republic still controlled the states of Sinaloa, Sonora, Durango, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon and part of Tamaulipas. These territories included some rich mining districts, and two important custom-houses at Matamoros and Mazatlán. In the South, Díaz still controlled Guerrero, Oaxaca, Tabasco, and Chiapas.

Meanwhile, Maximilian from Miramare Castle, had received the invitation from the Assembly of Notables, but put forth the condition that his rule first be ratified by a plebiscite. Bazaine carried out such a referendum in January 1864, through tactics such as the manipulation of returns along with the imprisonment of Mexican citizens who refused to accept Maximilian. 
Results showing overwhelming acceptance of Maximilian were sent by the French to Miramar, and Maximilian officially accepted the throne of the Mexican Empire on 10 April 1864, preparing then to depart for the country. 
Maximilian signed arrangements with Napoleon, agreeing that Mexico should assume the cost for its own occupation, a measure which caused outrage in the Juárez government. Maximilian and his wife Charlotte, now Empress of Mexico finally arrived in Mexico City on 12 June 1864.

In July 1864, Commander in Chief Uraga was accused of corresponding with the French. In response, Juárez deposed him and replaced him with José María Arteaga, upon which Uraga defected to the French.

===Juárez in El Paso del Norte===
In August, Governor Vidaurri, returned from Texas and launched an attack against Juárez, who narrowly escaped Monterrey in a bullet ridden carriage. President Juárez sent his family to New Orleans for their safety, while he then headed for the state of Chihuahua. He established a new capital in Chihuahua City in October, 1864. By December, the French has seized the states of Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, and most of Coahuila.

General Ortega, ambitious for the presidency himself, challenged Juárez on constitutional grounds, claiming that Juárez’ constitutional term had expired, but his efforts failed, as it was indicated to him that the expiration of the current presidential term would not actually occur for another year. Juárez proceeded to extend this own terms until elections could be held and Ortega retired to the United States. Juárez continued to suffer reverses in the North throughout the rest of the year, but in the South, Porfirio Díaz had managed to expel the French from Acapulco in December.

Díaz himself was captured after the French advanced upon Oaxaca City in February 1865and yet guerrilla warfare continued throughout the South. Díaz would escape French captivity after seven months, and almost immediately recaptured the state of Guerrero.

The approaching end of the American Civil War brought much hope to the Republican cause, and Juárez alluded to a future Union victory in order to inspire his partisans, for a victorious United States would be able to more stridently oppose the Second French Intervention as a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. After the Civil War ended in April, 1865, a concentration of American troops along the Rio Bravo, caused Bazaine to send more of his troops to the north, resulting in an increase of Republican guerrilla activity in states such as Guanajuato and Michoacan. Some imperial prefects resigned for lack of troops, and Emperor Maximilian blamed Bazaine for the crisis.

In June, Franco-Imperial forces dispersed the main Republican army in the North under General Miguel Negrete. This inspired Maximilian to attempt to drive Juárez out of the country, hoping this would damage his cause in American public opinion before the next meeting of the United States Congress. Juárez was forced to evacuate Chihuahua City, but Bazaine did not pursue any further fearing a clash of French troops with American troops, and Juárez made his new capital in El Paso del Norte.

On 2 October 1865, acting upon the false intelligence that Juárez had left the country, Maximilian passed the so-called Black Decree, enacting summary execution for anyone now found waging guerrilla warfare. One of the victims of the decree would be commander in chief of the Mexican Republican forces, José María Arteaga.

===Departure of the French===

On 1 October 1865, the Juárez government received a thirty million dollar loan from the United States. American volunteers also began to enlist in the army of the Mexican Republic.

On 30 November 1865, Juárez&#x27;s term expired, and according to the Constitution, due to the inability of holding elections, the office of the president was to pass down to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, which was then Jesús González Ortega. A constitutional crisis ensued as the latter once more challenged Juárez for the office, but Juárez denied the validity of Ortega&#x27;s claims, arguing that the relevant constitutional clause concerned itself with an interim presidency for the purpose of arranging new elections, which at the moment were impossible. Juárez passed a decree prolonging his own presidency and it was generally accepted among the Liberals.

Throughout late 1865, Napoleon III began to realize that the French troops were involved in a military quagmire. At the opening of the French Chambers in January 1866, he announced his intention of withdrawing French troops from Mexico. Faced with the impending collapse of the Empire, Empress Carlota traveled to Europe to seek more military support. Upon the failure of her efforts, she was reduced to insanity. Upon receiving news of his wife&#x27;s failure and mental collapse Emperor Maximilian traveled to Orizaba in October 1866, and contemplated abdication.

The Second Mexican Empire was rapidly disintegrating in the wake of the departing French troops. By November, 1866, the Juárez government had recovered most of the country, including nearly all of the territory encompassed by a line running from Tuxpan through San Luis Potosi, to Morelia, and nearly all of the territory south of Cuernavaca. Notwithstanding, Maximilian&#x27;s privy council voted against abdication and Maximilian decided upon not departing with the French. The French representatives to Maximilian formally expressed their opposition to the decision, and warned Maximilian that the Empire could not sustain itself independently.

===Execution of Maximilian===
Maximilian proposed a truce with Juárez and the summoning of a national congress to decide the fate of the Empire, but the proposal was ignored. The last of the French troops departed on 12 March 1867. Without French support, the rapidly collapsing Empire hardly lasted two months. Maximilian had returned to Mexico City and then headed northwest to Querétaro, where the Emperor and his top generals were captured after the end of a siege on 14 May 1867.

On 13 June, while President Juárez was now in San Luis Potosí, the government of the Mexican Republic placed Maximilian on trial in Querétaro for aiding the French invasion of Mexico, attempting to overthrow the Mexican government, and prolonging the bloodshed when his cause was already lost. His leading Mexican generals Tomas Mejia and Miguel Miramon were placed on trial alongside him for treason. All three were found guilty and sentenced to death. President Juárez rejected multiple appeals for clemency, including multiple official appeals from European governmentsand the three prisoners were eventually shot by firing squad on 19 June.

==Restored Republic==
===Return to Mexico City===

Juárez reentered the capital on the morning of 15 July, with Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, José María Iglesias, and , to public acclaim, the ringing of bells, and ceremonial artillery fire. He commuted the death sentences of several imperialists, but showed no mercy to the more important collaborators. Santiago Vidaurri was shot without even a trial. Juárez used his emergency presidential powers to abrogate a law of confiscation that was reducing collaborationist families to poverty, instead replacing their penalty with a fine.

Juárez reorganized his cabinet and reestablished the department of development. He decreed that the governments of the states should now return to their respective capitals. The army was also reduced in size. The Supreme Court was re-established under the presidency of Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. Day to day judicial acts during the French occupation, such as the granting of marriage certificates, were decreed valid.

A long-awaited electoral act was passed on 14 August, decreeing elections for the presidency, congress, and the supreme court. Referendums to amend the constitution were proposed, but opponents against any such amendments began to coalesce around the rival presidential candidacy of Porfirio Díaz.

Juárez subsequently won the presidential election which was held in October. He formally relinquished his emergency powers and on 25 December, officially began a new term scheduled to end on 30 November 1871.

At the opening of Congress on that same December, Juárez gave thanks to the American people, for their consistent support of the Mexican Republic during the French Intervention. Juárez also had to deal with certain insurrections, including a new resurgence in the Caste War, which ended in the establishment of a military colony in Campeche, and the Yaqui uprising in Sonora known as the Revolución de los Ríos.

Juárez&#x27; determination to maintain the same ministers that had served him during the intervention also inspired opposition from those within the Liberal Party ambitious to share in those offices. A January, 1868 request to congress asking for increased powers for the presidency, inspired opposition from those who believed Juárez was becoming autocratic. Gonzalez Ortega, who had already challenged Juárez twice during the intervention continued to press his constitutional claims to the presidency. On 18 August 1868, Ortega&#x27;s supporter General José María Patoni was assassinated by a local military brigade, leading to great public scandal.

The year 1869 was marked by minor scattered revolts, but a much more significant insurrection broke out in December, led by the Governor of Zacatecas. The affected states were placed under martial law, and the revolt was suppressed by February, 1870.

On 13 October 1870, a general amnesty law was passed against those who had collaborated with the French, excepting certain high officials.

===Díaz revolts===

As the 1871 presidential election approached, Juárez once more declared his candidacy, causing great opposition among those who viewed such a long term in power as a violation of the spirit of the constitution. Juárez had now been in power for more than twelve years. Porfirio Díaz once more ran for president, along with Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. Juárez obtained a majority of the votes, but not to the degree constitutionally required to win the election, and so the selection of the president fell upon congress, which on 12 October 1871, decided in favor of Juárez.

Supporters of Díaz accused the government of engaging in election fraud, refused to recognize Juárez as the legitimate president, and prepared to take up arms. The subsequent insurrection would come to be known as the Plan de La Noria from the eponymous city in which the revolution was proclaimed from on 8 November 1871.

Supporting revolts flared up throughout the country, and even the government of the State of Sonora officially joined the revolt in December, 1871. As late as July, 1872 military situation was serious, because though the Juárez government had won a series of victories, they had not been decisive. Juárez called Díaz a &quot;latter-day Santa Anna&quot;, invoking the liberals&#x27; archenemy. Juárez took the opportunity of the rebellion to attack entrenched groups within various states, using government forces to neutralize rebellious elements in state militias.

===Death===
On 18 July 1872, Juárez began to feel pain in his legs, while also experiencing difficulty breathing. He retired early from work and spent the rest of the day with his family, hoping in the morning to exercise by hiking through Chapultepec Forest. However, as night approached his illness worsened, and Juárez began to experience heart problems. The president died around 11 in the evening surrounded by friends and family.

Following the constitutional line of succession, Juárez was succeeded the next day by the president of the supreme court, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. The late president lay in state until 22 July, and he was carried by carriage in a solemn funeral procession through Mexico City until being interred in the San Fernando Cemetery.

==Personal life==

On 31 October 1843, when he was in his late 30s, Juárez married Margarita Maza, the adoptive daughter of his sister&#x27;s patron. Margarita was 20 years younger than Juárez. Her father Antonio Maza Padilla was from Genoa and her mother Petra Parada Sigüenza was Mexican and of Spanish descent. They were part of Oaxaca&#x27;s upper-class society. Margarita Maza accepted his proposal and said of Juárez, &quot;He is very homely, but very good.&quot; With his marriage to a white woman, Juárez gained social standing. Although legal racial categories were abolished shortly after independence, in social life, ethnic categories were still used. Their ethnically mixed (white/Indigenous) marriage was unusual at the time, but it is not often explicitly noted in standard biographies. Their marriage lasted until Margarita&#x27;s death from cancer in January 1871, when Juárez was planning his run for reelection. Juárez and Maza had ten children together, who were ethnically mixed mestizos, including twins María de Jesús and Josefa, born in 1854. Two boys and three girls died in early childhood. Two of their sons died while they were in exile in New York with their mother during the French Intervention. Their only surviving son was , b. 29 October 1852, was a diplomat and politician, and Governor of Oaxaca 1911–12; he married but had no children. Juárez&#x27;s daughter Manuela married Cuban poet and separatist in May 1863.

Benito Juárez married five times, one of his wives was Andra Campa, with whom he had a daughter Beatriz Juárez. Benito Juárez officially recognized Beatriz as his own child by giving her his last name in her birth certificate. Beatriz Juárez later married Alberto Savage Robert and together, they had three children named Alberto Savage Juárez, Beatriz Savage Juárez and Carlos Savage Juárez, who became a cadet in Mexico&#x27;s Heroic Military Academy and participated in the famous &quot;&quot; or &quot;March of Loyalty&quot; of Mexican ex-president Francisco I. Madero. Carlos Savage Juárez&#x27;s children were well known in the film industry: Carlos Savage (1919–2000) was a highly respected Mexican film editor who contributed to over 1,000 award-winning films and documentaries throughout his career.

Benito Juárez is also known to have had two other children with other women. He had fathered a son and a daughter before he married Margarita, a son, Tereso, perhaps around 1838; and Susana. Little is known about them. One of his biographers, Charles Allen Smart, citing the work of Jorge L. Tamayo, the editor of Juárez&#x27;s letters, says that Juárez&#x27;s natural son might be alluded to in a letter from a certain Refugio Álvarez, an officer during the French invasion. Juárez&#x27;s son was taken prisoner by conservative general Tomás Mejía when the conservatives captured San Luis Potosí in December 1863. Juárez&#x27;s two sons with Margarita Maza were minors at the time and the third not yet born, so the conclusion is that the letter refers to Tereso. In his research for the biography, Smart found no explicit references to Tereso. Juárez&#x27;s daughter Susana was mentioned by Tamayo, and Smart includes that information, but without page citations to Tamayo&#x27;s publication. Susana was said to have become an invalid and a narcotics addict who was cared for by Juárez&#x27;s friends Sr. Miguel Castro and his wife when Castro was governor of Oaxaca. The natural children&#x27;s mother died before Juárez married Margarita, when Susana was three years old. Juárez and his wife formally adopted Susana, who never married and was with her adoptive mother at her death. Margarita Maza de Juárez was buried in the Juárez mausoleum in Mexico City.

Juárez wrote books for his children, such as the book &quot;Apuntes para mis Hijos&quot; (&quot;Notes for my Children&quot; in English). However, this book only briefly talked about his Indigenous heritage, describing his parents as &quot;Indians of the country&#x27;s primitive race.&quot; His vision of Mexico was that individual Indigenous Mexicans would assimilate culturally and become full citizens of Mexico, equal before the law. &quot;Everything that Juárez and the Liberal circle stood for militated against [his] identification&quot; as an Indigenous person. According to one biographer, he &quot;has been the object of so much mythology that it is almost impossible to uncover the facts of his life.&quot;

Juárez was a 33rd Scottish Rite Freemason and a member of the directive of the Mexican brotherhood. He was initiated under the name of Guillermo Tell.

Juárez&#x27;s health suffered in 1870, but he recovered. His wife Margarita died in 1871 and his health began to fail in 1872. He suffered a heart attack in March 1872, the day before his birthday. He suffered another attack on 8 July and a fatal attack on 17 July.

===Freemasonry===
Juárez was initiated into Freemasonry in the York Rite in Oaxaca. He then moved to the National Mexican Rite, where he ascended to the highest degree, the ninth, which is equivalent to the 33rd degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The York Rite was of more liberal and republican ideas with respect to the Scottish Rite that also existed in Mexico, which was of centralist political ideas. The National Mexican Rite emerged from a group of Yorkist Masons and another group of Scottish Masons whose common objective was to gain independence from foreigners and promote a nationalist mentality.

Juárez was fervent in Masonic practice. His name is held in veneration in many rites. Many lodges and philosophical bodies have adopted him as a sacred symbol.

Juárez&#x27;s initiation ceremony was attended by distinguished Masons, such as Manuel Crescencio Rejon, author of the Yucatán Constitution of 1840; Valentín Gómez Farías, President of Mexico; Pedro Zubieta, General Commander in the Federal District and the State of Mexico; Congressman Fernando Ortega; Congressman Tiburcio Cañas; Congressman Francisco Banuet; Congressman Agustin Buenrostro; Congressman Joaquin Navarro and Congressman Miguel Lerdo de Tejada. After the proclamation, the apprentice mason Juárez adopted the symbolic name of Guillermo Tell, 14th century Swiss folk hero.

==Death==
Juárez died of a heart attack on 18 July 1872, aged 66. He had been ill for two days, seemingly without alarming symptoms, but he appears to have suffered an attack similar to the one in October 1870. &quot;At daybreak on the morning of the 19th [of July] the inhabitants of this capital were startled by the roar of artillery, followed by a gun [shot] each quarter of an hour, which indicated the death of the head of the government.&quot; A death mask was made and Juárez was given a state funeral. He is buried in the Panteón de San Fernando, where other Mexican notables are interred. There is an account in Ralph Roeder&#x27;s 1947 lengthy biography of Juárez about his death, but although the work has many direct quotations from sources, it is flawed because there are no scholarly citations.

When Juárez died, Díaz&#x27;s reasons for rebellion – fraudulent elections, presidential coercion of states – no longer existed. He was succeeded by Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, the head of the Supreme Court. Díaz was amnestied for his rebellion by Lerdo in November 1872. Díaz later rebelled against Lerdo in 1876. Although Díaz was a rival of Juárez during his life, after Díaz seized power he helped shape the historical memory of Juárez.

==Legacy==
Juárez came to be seen as &quot;a preeminent symbol of Mexican nationalism and resistance to foreign intervention&quot;. His policies advocated civil liberties, equality before the law, the sovereignty of civilian power over the Catholic Church and the military, the strengthening of the Mexican federal government, and the depersonalization of political life. For Juárez&#x27;s success in ousting French invasion, Mexicans considered Juárez&#x27;s tenure as a time of a &quot;second struggle for independence, a second defeat for the European powers, and a second reversal of the Conquest&quot;.

Today, Benito Juárez is remembered as being a progressive reformer dedicated to democracy, equal rights for Indigenous peoples, reduction in the power of organized religion, especially the Catholic Church, and a defense of national sovereignty. The period of his leadership is known in Mexican history as &quot;La Reforma del Norte&quot; (&quot;reform of the north&quot;). It constituted a liberal political and social revolution with major institutional consequences: the expropriation of church lands, the subordination of the army to civilian control, liquidation of peasant communal landholdings, the separation of church and state in public affairs, and the disenfranchisement of bishops, priests, nuns, and lay brothers, codified in the &quot;Juárez Law&quot;, or &quot;Ley Juárez&quot;.

&quot;La Reforma&quot; represented the triumph of Mexico&#x27;s liberal, federalist, anti-clerical, and pro-capitalist forces over the conservative, centrist, corporatist, and theocratic elements that sought to reconstitute a locally run version of the colonial era. It replaced a semi-feudal social system with a more market-driven one. But, following Juárez&#x27;s death, the lack of adequate democratic and institutional stability soon resulted in a return to centralized autocracy and economic exploitation under the regime of Porfirio Díaz. The &quot;Porfiriato&quot; (1876–1911), in turn, collapsed at the beginning of the Mexican Revolution.

==Honors and recognition==

Honors in his lifetime
* On 7 February 1866, Juárez was elected as mayor a companion of the 3rd class of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS). While membership in MOLLUS was normally limited to Union officers who had served during the American Civil War and their descendants, members of the 3rd Class were civilians who had made a significant contribution to the Union war effort. Juárez is one of the very few non-United States citizens to be a MOLLUS companion.
* On 11 May 1867, the Congress of the Dominican Republic proclaimed Juárez the &quot;Benemérito de la América&quot; (Distinguished of America).
* On 16 July 1867, the government of Peru recognized Juárez&#x27;s accomplishments and on 28 July of the same year the School of Medicine of San Fernando, Perú, issued a gold medal to honor him; the medal can be seen at the &quot;Museo Nacional de Historia&quot;.

In 2018, new $500.00 (five hundred pesos) bills were released, also featuring the bust of Juárez. A caption directly below this says in Spanish, &quot;President Benito Juárez, promoter of the Laws of Reform, during his triumphant entrance to Mexico City on 13 July 1867, symbolizing the restoration of the Republic&quot;. Juárez appears to face a depiction of his entrance into Mexico City. His likeness appears on two bills simultaneously, and while both are blue in color, the 500-peso and 20-peso notes differ in size and texture.

<doc id="103362" wikidata="Q171128" url="?curid=103362" title="Diego Rivera">
<text>Diego Rivera (; December 8, 1886 – November 24, 1957) was a prominent Mexican painter. His large frescoes helped establish the mural movement in Mexican and international art.

Between 1922 and 1953, Rivera painted murals in, among other places, Mexico City, Chapingo, and Cuernavaca, Mexico; and San Francisco, Detroit, and New York City, United States. In 1931, a retrospective exhibition of his works was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York; this was before he completed his 27-mural series known as &quot;Detroit Industry Murals&quot;.

Rivera had four wives and numerous children, including at least one illegitimate daughter. His first child and only son died at the age of two. His third wife was fellow Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, with whom he had a volatile relationship that continued until her death. His fourth and final wife was his agent.

Due to his importance in the country&#x27;s art history, the government of Mexico declared Rivera&#x27;s works as &quot;monumentos históricos&quot;. As of 2018, Rivera holds the record for highest price at auction for a work by a Latin American artist. The 1931 painting &quot;The Rivals&quot;, part of the record-setting Collection of Peggy Rockefeller and David Rockefeller, sold for US$9.76 million.

==Personal life==

Rivera was born on December 8, 1886, as one of twin boys in Guanajuato, Mexico, to María del Pilar Barrientos and Diego Rivera Acosta, a well-to-do couple. His twin brother Carlos died two years after they were born.

His mother María del Pilar Barrientos was said to have &quot;converso&quot; ancestry (Spanish ancestors who were forced to convert from Judaism to Catholicism in the 15th and 16th centuries). Rivera wrote in 1935: &quot;My Jewishness is the dominant element in my life&quot;, despite never being raised practicing any Jewish faith, Rivera felt his Jewish ancestry informed his art and gave him &quot;sympathy with the downtrodden masses&quot;. Diego was of Spanish, Amerindian, African, Italian, Jewish, Russian, and Portuguese descent.

Rivera began drawing at the age of three, a year after his twin brother died. When he was caught drawing on the walls of the house, his parents installed chalkboards and canvas on the walls to encourage him.

===Marriages and families===
After moving to Paris, Rivera met Angelina Beloff, an artist from the pre-Revolutionary Russian Empire. They married in 1911, and had a son, Diego (1916–1918), who died young. During this time, Rivera also had a relationship with painter Maria Vorobieff-Stebelska, who gave birth to a daughter named Marika Rivera in 1918 or 1919.

Rivera divorced Beloff and married Guadalupe Marín as his second wife in June 1922, after having returned to Mexico. They had two daughters together: Ruth and Guadalupe.

He was still married when he met art student Frida Kahlo in Mexico. They began a passionate affair and, after he divorced Marín, Rivera married Kahlo on August 21, 1929. He was 42 and she was 22. Their mutual infidelities and his violent temper resulted in divorce in 1939, but they remarried December 8, 1940, in San Francisco, California.

A year after Kahlo&#x27;s death, on July 29, 1955, Rivera married Emma Hurtado, his agent since 1946.

In his later years Rivera lived in the United States and Mexico. Rivera died on November 24, 1957, at the age of 70. He was buried at the Panteón de Dolores in Mexico City.

===Personal beliefs===
Rivera was an atheist. His mural &quot;Dreams of a Sunday in the Alameda&quot; depicted Ignacio Ramírez holding a sign that read, &quot;God does not exist&quot;. This work caused a furor, but Rivera refused to remove the inscription. The painting was not shown for nine years – until Rivera agreed to remove the inscription. He stated: &quot;To affirm &#x27;God does not exist&#x27;, I do not have to hide behind Don Ignacio Ramírez; I am an atheist and I consider religions to be a form of collective neurosis.&quot;

===Art education and circle===
From the age of ten, Rivera studied art at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. He was sponsored to continue study in Europe by Teodoro A. Dehesa Méndez, the governor of the State of Veracruz. After arriving in Europe in 1907, Rivera first went to Madrid, Spain to study with Eduardo Chicharro.

From there he went to Paris, France, a destination for young European and American artists and writers, who settled in inexpensive flats in Montparnasse. His circle frequented La Ruche, where his Italian friend Amedeo Modigliani painted his portrait in 1914. His circle of close friends included Ilya Ehrenburg, Chaïm Soutine, Modigliani and his wife Jeanne Hébuterne, Max Jacob, gallery owner Léopold Zborowski, and Moise Kisling. Rivera&#x27;s former lover Marie Vorobieff-Stebelska (Marevna) honored the circle in her painting &quot;Homage to Friends from Montparnasse&quot; (1962).

In those years, some prominent young painters were experimenting with an art form that would later be known as Cubism, a movement led by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. From 1913 to 1917, Rivera enthusiastically embraced this new style. Around 1917, inspired by Paul Cézanne&#x27;s paintings, Rivera shifted toward Post-Impressionism, using simple forms and large patches of vivid colors. His paintings began to attract attention, and he was able to display them at several exhibitions.

Rivera claimed in his autobiography that, while in Mexico in 1904, he engaged in cannibalism, pooling his money with others to &quot;purchase cadavers from the city morgue&quot; and particularly &quot;relish[ing] women&#x27;s brains in vinaigrette&quot;. This claim has been considered factually suspect or an elaborate lie. He wrote in his autobiography: &quot;I believe that when man evolves a civilization higher than the mechanized but still primitive one he has now, the eating of human flesh will be sanctioned. For then man will have thrown off all of his superstitions and irrational taboos.&quot;

==Career in Mexico==

In 1920, urged by Alberto J. Pani, the Mexican ambassador to France, Rivera left France and traveled through Italy studying its art, including Renaissance frescoes. After José Vasconcelos became Minister of Education, Rivera returned to Mexico in 1921 to become involved in the government sponsored Mexican mural program planned by Vasconcelos. The program included such Mexican artists as José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Rufino Tamayo, and the French artist Jean Charlot. In January 1922, he painted – experimentally in encaustic – his first significant mural &quot;Creation&quot; in the Bolívar Auditorium of the National Preparatory School in Mexico City while guarding himself with a pistol against right-wing students.

In the autumn of 1922, Rivera participated in the founding of the Revolutionary Union of Technical Workers, Painters and Sculptors, and later that year he joined the Mexican Communist Party (including its Central Committee). His murals, subsequently painted in fresco only, dealt with Mexican society and reflected the country&#x27;s 1910 Revolution. Rivera developed his own native style based on large, simplified figures and bold colors with an Aztec influence clearly present in murals at the Secretariat of Public Education in Mexico City begun in September 1922, intended to consist of one hundred and twenty-four frescoes, and finished in 1928.
Rivera&#x27;s art work, in a fashion similar to the steles of the Maya, tells stories. The mural (&quot;In the Arsenal&quot;) shows on the right-hand side Tina Modotti holding an ammunition belt and facing Julio Antonio Mella, in a light hat, and Vittorio Vidali behind in a black hat. However, the detail shown does not include the right-hand side described nor any of the three individuals mentioned; instead it shows the left-hand side with Frida Kahlo handing out munitions. Leon Trotsky lived with Rivera and Kahlo for several months while exiled in Mexico. Some of Rivera&#x27;s most famous murals are featured at the National School of Agriculture (Chapingo Autonomous University of Agriculture) at Chapingo near Texcoco (1925–1927), in the Cortés Palace in Cuernavaca (1929–30), and the National Palace in Mexico City (1929–30, 1935).

Rivera painted murals in the main hall and corridor at the Chapingo Autonomous University of Agriculture (UACh). He also painted a fresco mural titled (&quot;Fertile Land&quot; in English) in the university&#x27;s chapel between 1923 and 1927. &quot;Fertile Land&quot; depicts the revolutionary struggles of Mexico&#x27;s peasant (farmers) and working classes (industry) in part through the depiction of hammer and sickle joined by a star in the soffit of the chapel. In the mural, a &quot;propagandist&quot; points to another hammer and sickle. The mural features a woman with an ear of corn in each hand, which art critic Antonio Rodriguez describes as evocative of the Aztec goddess of maize in his book .

The corpses of revolutionary heroes Emiliano Zapata and Otilio Montano are shown in graves, their bodies fertilizing the maize field above. A sunflower in the center of the scene &quot;glorifies those who died for an ideal and are reborn, transfigured, into the fertile cornfield of the nation&quot;, writes Rodrigues. The mural also depicts Rivera&#x27;s wife Guadalupe Marin as a fertile nude goddess and their daughter Guadalupe Rivera y Marin as a cherub.

The mural was slightly damaged in an earthquake, but has since been repaired and touched up, remaining in pristine form.

==Later years==

In the autumn of 1927, Rivera went to Moscow, Soviet Union, having accepted a government invitation to take part in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. The following year, while still in the Soviet Union, he met American Alfred H. Barr Jr., who would soon become Rivera&#x27;s friend and patron. Barr was the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

Although commissioned to paint a mural for the Red Army Club in Moscow, in 1928 Rivera was ordered by authorities to leave the country because, he suspected, of &quot;resentment on the part of certain Soviet artists.&quot; He returned to Mexico.

In 1929, following the assassination of former president Álvaro Obregón the previous year, the government suppressed the Mexican Communist Party. That year Rivera was expelled from the party because of his suspected Trotskyite sympathies. In addition, observers noted that his 1928 mural &quot;In the Arsenal&quot; includes the figures of communists Tina Modotti, Cuban Julio Antonio Mella, and Italian Vittorio Vidali. After Mella was murdered in January 1929, allegedly by Stalinist assassin Vidali, Rivera was accused of having had advance knowledge of a planned attack.

After divorcing his second wife, Guadalupe (Lupe) Marin, Rivera married the much younger Frida Kahlo in August 1929. They had met when she was a student, and she was 22 years old when they married; Rivera was 42.

Also in 1929, American journalist Ernestine Evans&#x27;s book &quot;The Frescoes of Diego Rivera&quot;, was published in New York City; it was the first English-language book on the artist. In December, Rivera accepted a commission from the American ambassador to Mexico to paint murals in the Palace of Cortés in Cuernavaca, where the US had a consulate.

In September 1930, Rivera accepted a commission by architect Timothy L. Pflueger for two works related to his design projects in San Francisco. Rivera and Kahlo went to the city in November. Rivera painted a mural for the City Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange for US$2,500. He also completed a fresco for the California School of Fine Art, a work that was later relocated to what is now the Diego Rivera Gallery at the San Francisco Art Institute.

During this period, Rivera and Kahlo worked and lived at the studio of Ralph Stackpole, who had recommended Rivera to Pflueger. Rivera met Helen Wills Moody, a notable American tennis player, who modeled for his City Club mural.

In November 1931, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a retrospective exhibition of Rivera&#x27;s work; Kahlo attended with him.

Between 1932 and 1933, Rivera completed a major commission: twenty-seven fresco panels, entitled &quot;Detroit Industry,&quot; on the walls of an inner court at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Part of the cost was paid by Edsel Ford, scion of the entrepreneur.

During the McCarthyism of the 1950s, a was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as &quot;detestable.&quot;

His mural &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;, originally a three-paneled work, begun as a commission for John D. Rockefeller Jr. in 1933 for the Rockefeller Center in New York City, was later destroyed. Because it included a portrait of Vladimir Lenin, former leader of the Soviet Union and Marxist pro-worker content, Rockefeller&#x27;s son, the press, and some of the public protested, but the decision to destroy it was made by the management company. Anti-Communism ran high in some American circles, although many others in this period of the Great Depression had been drawn to the movement as offering hope to labor.

When Diego refused to remove Lenin from the painting, he was ordered to leave the US. One of Diego&#x27;s assistants managed to take a few photographs of the work so Diego was able to later recreate it. American poet Archibald MacLeish wrote six &quot;irony-laden&quot; poems about the mural. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine published E. B. White&#x27;s light poem, &quot;I paint what I see: A ballad of artistic integrity&quot;, also in response to the controversy with number of sponsors taking offense to it. As a result of the negative publicity, officials in Chicago cancelled their commission for Rivera to paint a mural for the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. Rivera issued a press statement, saying that he would use the remaining money from his commission at Rockefeller Center to repaint the same mural, over and over, wherever he was asked, until the money ran out. He had been paid in full although the mural was reportedly destroyed. There have been rumors that the mural was covered over rather than removed and destroyed, but this has not been confirmed.

In December 1933, Rivera returned to Mexico. He repainted &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; in 1934 in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, calling this version &quot;Man, Controller of the Universe&quot;.

On June 5, 1940, invited again by Pflueger, Rivera returned for the last time to the United States to paint a ten-panel mural for the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. His work, &quot;Pan American Unity&quot; was completed November 29, 1940. Rivera painted in front of attendees at the Exposition, which had already opened. He received US$1,000 per month and US$1,000 for travel expenses. The mural includes representations of two of Pflueger&#x27;s architectural works, and portraits of Rivera&#x27;s wife, Frida Kahlo, woodcarver Dudley C. Carter, and actress Paulette Goddard. She is shown holding Rivera&#x27;s hand as they plant a white tree together. Rivera&#x27;s assistants on the mural included Thelma Johnson Streat, a pioneer African-American artist, dancer, and textile designer. The mural and its archives are now held by City College of San Francisco.

In 1946-47, Rivera painted &quot;A Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Park&quot;, a fresco that featured a fully elaborated figure of La Calavera Catrina. This character, which was created by José Guadalupe Posada, originally consisted of a print depicting the head and shoulders of a skeletal woman in a big hat. Rivera endowed his Catrina figure with indigenous features and thus transformed her into a nationalist icon. Catrina is the most common image associated with Day of the Dead.

===Membership in AMORC===
In 1926, Rivera became a member of AMORC, the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, an occult organization founded by American occultist Harvey Spencer Lewis. In 1926, Rivera was among the founders of AMORC&#x27;s Mexico City lodge, called Quetzalcoatl after an ancient indigenous god. He painted an image of Quetzalcoatl for the local temple.

In 1954, Rivera tried to be readmitted into the Mexican Communist Party. He had been expelled in part because of his support of Trotsky, who had been exiled and assassinated years before in Mexico. Rivera was required to justify his AMORC activities. At the time, the Mexican Communist Party excluded persons involved in Freemasonry, and regarded AMORC as suspiciously similar to Freemasonry. Rivera told his questioners that, by joining AMORC, he wanted to infiltrate a typical &quot;Yankee&quot; organization on behalf of Communism. However, he also claimed that AMORC was &quot;essentially materialist, insofar as it only admits different states of energy and matter, and is based on ancient Egyptian occult knowledge from Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti.&quot;

===Representation in other media===
Diego Rivera has been portrayed in several films. He was played by Rubén Blades in &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1999), by Alfred Molina in &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), and (in a brief appearance) by José Montini in &quot;Eisenstein in Guanajuato&quot; (2015).

Barbara Kingsolver&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Lacuna&quot; features Rivera, Kahlo, and Leon Trotsky as major characters.

An important scene of the Netflix television series &quot;Sense8&quot; (Episode S1E8 &quot;Death Doesn&#x27;t Let You Say Goodbye,&quot; broadcast in 2015) is played in the Anahuacalli Museum, called “Diego Rivera Museum” by the Lito character. He and his co-sensate, Nomi, discuss about Rivera sitting in front of what is supposed to be a sketch of Rivera&#x27;s Man at the Crossroads mural for the Rockefeller Center, destroyed in 1933 by Rockefeller.

==Autobiography==
&quot;My Life, My Art: An Autobiography&quot;, by Diego Rivera, with Gladys March, was published posthumously in 1960. Beginning with a 1944 interview for a newspaper article, March &quot;spent several months each year with Rivera, eventually filling 2,000 pages with his recollections and interpretations of his art and life&quot;, and compiled an autobiography, written in the first person.

<doc id="103363" wikidata="Q464476" url="?curid=103363" title="Black Flag (band)">
<text>Black Flag is an American punk rock band formed in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California. Initially called Panic, the band was established by Greg Ginn, the guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole continuous member, and singer Keith Morris. They are widely considered to be one of the first hardcore punk bands, as well as one of the pioneers of After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag reunited in 2003 and again in 2013. The second reunion lasted well over a year, during which they released their first studio album in nearly three decades, &quot;What The...&quot; (2013). The band announced their third reunion in January 2019.

Black Flag&#x27;s sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with a style of atonal guitar soloing compared to that of the New York Dolls’ lead guitarist Johnny Thunders, and, in later years, frequent tempo shifts. The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an anti-authoritarian and nonconformist message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of social isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia. These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band&#x27;s material was released on Ginn&#x27;s independent record label SST Records.

Over the course of the 1980s, Black Flag&#x27;s sound, as well as their notoriety, evolved. In addition to being central to the creation of hardcore punk, they were innovators in the first wave of American West Coast punk rock and are considered a key influence on punk subculture in the United States and abroad. Along with being among the earliest punk rock groups to incorporate elements and the influence of heavy metal melodies and rhythm, there were often overt free jazz and contemporary classical elements in their sound, especially in Ginn&#x27;s guitar playing, and the band interspersed records and performances with instrumentals throughout their career. They also played longer, slower, and more complex songs at a time when other bands in their milieu performed a raw, fast, three-chord format.

Black Flag has been well-respected within the punk subculture, primarily for their tireless promotion of an autonomous DIY punk ethic and aesthetic. They are often regarded as pioneers in the movement of underground do-it-yourself record labels. By way of constant touring throughout the United States and Canada, and occasionally Europe, Black Flag established a dedicated cult following.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1976–1981)===
Initially called Panic, Black Flag was formed in 1976 in Hermosa Beach by Greg Ginn and Keith Morris. Morris originally was to play drums for the band, until Ginn, impressed by his energy and charisma, insisted he be the front man. Ginn and Morris had trouble early on finding bandmates. They had an especially difficult time finding a reliable bass guitarist and often rehearsed without a bassist, a factor that contributed to the development of Ginn&#x27;s distinctive guitar sound. Ginn&#x27;s brother Raymond Pettibon and SST house record producer-to-be Spot filled in during rehearsals. In the beginning, Ginn and Morris were inspired by the raw, stripped-down attitude of bands such as the Ramones and the Stooges. Ginn has said &quot;We were influenced by the Stooges and then the Ramones; they inspired us. Keith and myself saw the Ramones when they first toured LA in 1976. After we saw them, I said if they could do it we could do it. I thought Keith would be a good singer and after seeing the Ramones, it made him think that he doesn&#x27;t have to be some classical operatic singer.&quot;

Chuck Dukowski, bassist of Würm, liked Ginn&#x27;s band and eventually joined, forming a committed quartet with Ginn, Morris and drummer Brian Migdol. Dukowski insisted the band rehearse much more frequently, sometimes seven days per week. The band held their first performance in December 1977 in Redondo Beach, California. To avoid confusion with another band called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in late 1978. They played their first show under this name on January 27, 1979, at the Moose Lodge Hall in Redondo Beach, California. Future Black Flag vocalists Dez Cadena and Ron Reyes were both in attendance at the Moose Lodge show.

The name was suggested by Ginn&#x27;s brother, artist Raymond Pettibon, who also designed the band&#x27;s logo: a stylized black flag represented as four black bars. Pettibon stated &quot;If a white flag means surrender, a black flag represents anarchy.&quot; Their new name was reminiscent of the anarchist symbol, the insecticide of the same name, and of the British heavy metal band Black Sabbath, one of Ginn&#x27;s favorite bands. Ginn suggested that he was &quot;comfortable with &quot;all&quot; the implications of the name.&quot; The band spray painted the simple, striking logo all over Los Angeles, attracting attention from both supporters and the Los Angeles Police Department. Pettibon designed all of the band&#x27;s early flyers and album covers through the 1980s.

There were few opportunities for punk rock bands to perform in Southern California (Los Angeles club The Masque was the center of the L.A. punk scene, but was also rather parochial, and did not often admit bands from outside L.A. proper). Black Flag organized their own gigs, performing at picnics, house parties, schools; any place that was available. They called club owners themselves to arrange appearances, and plastered hundreds of flyers—usually Pettibon&#x27;s severe, haunting comic strip style panels—on any available surface to publicize performances. Dukowski reported that the &quot;minimum [number of flyers] that went out was 500 for a show.&quot; Black Flag shows were regularly broken up by the LAPD, often violently, at the direction of Chief of Police Daryl Gates, who targeted punk rock shows in the city.

In 1979, the band released their first recording, the &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; EP. It was the debut release by Ginn&#x27;s SST Records, which he created due to the band&#x27;s difficulty in securing a contract with existing labels due to their reputation.

Though Ginn was the band&#x27;s leader, he was more quiet than Dukowski, whose intelligent, fast-talking, high-energy persona attracted significant attention, and he often served as Black Flag&#x27;s spokesman to the press. Dukowski acted as the group&#x27;s tour manager even after he no longer performed with them, and helped establish the band&#x27;s DIY punk ethic and demanding work ethic. Dukowski&#x27;s bass guitar was a vital part of the early Black Flag sound; &quot;TV Party&quot;, for instance, was one of many songs &quot;driven more by Chuck Dukowski&#x27;s percolating bass line than Ginn&#x27;s stun-gun guitar.&quot;

Morris performed as vocalist on Black Flag&#x27;s earliest recordings, and his energized, manic stage presence was pivotal in the band earning a reputation in Southern California. Migdol was replaced by the enigmatic Colombian drummer Robo, whose numerous clicking metallic bracelets became part of his drum sound. The band played with a speed and ferocity that was all but unprecedented in rock music; critic Ira Robbins declared that &quot;Black Flag was, for all intents and purposes, America&#x27;s first hardcore band.&quot; Morris quit in 1979, citing, among other reasons, creative differences with Ginn, and his own &quot;freaking out on cocaine and speed.&quot; Morris would subsequently form the Circle Jerks.

After Morris&#x27;s departure, Black Flag recruited fan Ron Reyes as singer. With Reyes, Black Flag recorded the &quot;Jealous Again&quot; 12-inch EP and appeared in the film &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;. This was also the line-up that toured up and down the West Coast for the first time, the version most fans outside of L.A. first saw.

In 1980, Reyes quit Black Flag mid-performance at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach because of escalating violence. For the remainder of that gig, the band played an extended version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and invited audience members to take turns singing.

Dez Cadena, another fan, then joined as a vocalist, and the band continued touring throughout the United States as well as England. By the summer of 1981, Cadena opted to play guitar rather than perform vocals, and the band sought a new singer while on the East Coast of the United States.

===Rollins era (1981–1986)===

Twenty-year-old fan Henry Rollins (birth name Henry Garfield) was then living in Washington, D.C., and singing for hardcore band State of Alert (S.O.A.). S.O.A. drummer Ivor Hanson had a father who was a top admiral in the US Navy, and his family shared living quarters with the vice president of the United States in the United States Naval Observatory. The band held their practices there, and would have to be let in by United States Secret Service agents.

S.O.A. had corresponded with Black Flag, and met them when they performed on the U.S. east coast. At an impromptu show at A7 in New York City, Rollins had asked the band to perform &quot;Clocked In&quot;, and the band offered to let him sing. Since vocalist Dez Cadena was switching to guitar, the band then invited Rollins to audition. Impressed by his stage demeanor, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, due in part to Ian MacKaye&#x27;s encouragement. Rollins acted as roadie for the remainder of the tour while learning Black Flag&#x27;s songs during sound checks and encores, while Cadena crafted guitar parts that meshed with Ginn&#x27;s. Rollins also impressed Black Flag with his broad musical interests during an era when punk rock music and fans were increasingly factionalized; he introduced Black Flag to Washington D.C.&#x27;s go-go, a distinctive take on funk music.

Rollins was Black Flag&#x27;s longest-lasting vocalist. When he joined Black Flag, he brought a different attitude and perspective than previous singers. Some earlier songs, such as &quot;Six Pack&quot; (a song written about original singer Keith Morris) blended a sense of black humor with driving punk rock. Rollins was an intense performer, who usually appeared onstage wearing only shorts. Ginn once stated that after Rollins joined, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t do songs with a sense of humor anymore; he got into the serious way-out poet thing.&quot;

With Rollins, Black Flag began work on their first full-length album, &quot;Damaged&quot;. The sessions for the album (chronicled in Michael Azerrad&#x27;s book &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot;) were a source of conflict between the band and engineer/producer Spot, who had worked with the band and the SST label since their early years. Spot had already recorded many of the &quot;Damaged&quot; tracks with Dez Cadena on vocals (as well as Keith Morris and Ron Reyes) and felt that the band&#x27;s sound was ruined with the two guitar line-up (these versions can be heard on the albums &quot;Everything Went Black&quot; and &quot;The First Four Years&quot;). Whereas the earlier four-piece versions are more focused and much cleaner sounding, the &quot;Damaged&quot; recordings are more akin to a live recording, with little stereo separation of guitars, and somewhat muddy. When asked about the lo-fidelity production, Spot has said &quot;They &quot;wanted&quot; it to sound that way.&quot; As such, &quot;Damaged&quot; is generally regarded as Black Flag&#x27;s most focused recording, as well as its most iconic. One critic has written that &quot;Damaged&quot; was &quot;perhaps the best album to emerge from the quagmire that was early-&#x27;80s California punk ... the visceral, intensely physical presence of &quot;Damaged&quot; has yet to be equaled, although many bands have tried.&quot; &quot;Damaged&quot; was released in 1981, and the group began an extensive tour in support of it, forging an independent network for touring independent music acts that would form a cornerstone of the independent music scene for the decade to come.

The previous year 1980 saw the U.S. punk rock movement hitting a peak in popularity. With &quot;Damaged&quot; and their growing reputation as an impressive live band, Black Flag seemed poised on the cusp of a commercial breakthrough. The record was to be distributed by now-defunct Unicorn Records, a subsidiary of MCA. Trouble began when MCA refused to handle &quot;Damaged&quot; after MCA executive Al Bergamo determined the album was an &quot;Anti-Parent&quot; record. However, according to longtime SST employee Joe Carducci the &quot;Anti-Parent&quot; statement was not the real reason for MCA&#x27;s refusing to distribute &quot;Damaged&quot;; Carducci reported that Unicorn Records was so poorly managed and so deeply in debt that MCA stood to lose money by distributing the album, regardless of its content. This was the beginning of a legal dispute that would, for several years, disallow Black Flag from using their own name on any record after &quot;Damaged&quot; was released on SST Records and a copy of the &quot;Anti-Parent&quot; statement was placed on the album&#x27;s cover.

With their new singer, Black Flag and the Minutemen made their first tour of the UK through late 1981 and early 1982. During that tour, the band met punk icon Richard Hell and opened a concert for him. Rollins later published his diaries from that tour in his book &quot;Get in the Van&quot;. As the front man, Rollins was a frequent target of violent audience members, and started getting involved in fist-fights. Rollins developed a distinct showmanship on stage, where he could entertain an audience just by talking to them. The rest of the band were targets too, with Greg Ginn getting hit by a thrown bullet shell while playing in Colwyn Bay.

As Black Flag was about to return home, UK customs detained Colombian drummer Robo due to visa problems, and he was not able to return with the rest of the band. This would be the end of his tenure with the band (he was able to eventually re-enter the United States in mid-1982, at which point he would promptly join the Misfits as one of that band&#x27;s last drummers before its 1983 breakup). The loss of Robo put an end to extensive touring for a while. Emil Johnson of Twisted Roots filled in for one tour, but it was clear he was only temporary.

While on that tour in Vancouver, the band found out that drummer Chuck Biscuits was leaving D.O.A. He was quickly drafted on board, traveling with the band for the rest of the tour (cut short because of Henry Rollins&#x27; injured knee) to learn the songs. This lineup recorded the later-bootlegged cassette &quot;1982 Demos&quot;, showing the direction the band would go in for the &quot;My War&quot; album.

However, due to personality conflicts—in &quot;Get in the Van&quot;, Rollins described Biscuits as a &quot;fuck up&quot;—and the Unicorn court injunction-forced inactivity of Black Flag, Biscuits left to join their rivals the Circle Jerks. (Later, Biscuits joined ex-Misfits singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s solo project Danzig). Black Flag eventually got Bill Stevenson of Descendents to join permanently (he had filled in from time-to-time before). While the Unicorn Records court injunction prevented the group from releasing a new studio album, they nonetheless continued to work on new material, and embarked on a period which would mark a pronounced change in the group&#x27;s direction.

The band had also become increasingly interested in music other than punk rock, such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and some of the members (particularly Ginn) used cannabis. Newer material (which can be heard on the &quot;1982 Demos&quot; bootleg) was slower and less like typical punk music, with classic rock and blues influences seeping in. Cadena left in April 1983 to form his own band DC3. He would take some of the new songs he had written for Black Flag with him and record them for DC3&#x27;s debut album.

Additionally, by late 1983, Dukowski had retired from performing with Black Flag (some accounts report he was &quot;edged out&quot; by Ginn); Azerrad reports that Ginn was dissatisfied with Dukowski&#x27;s failure to progress as an instrumentalist, and made things difficult for Dukowski in an attempt to make him quit, but in the end, Rollins took it on himself to fire Dukowski. However, a few of Dukowski&#x27;s songs were featured on later albums, and he continued acting in his capacity as tour manager.

1983 found Black Flag with fresh songs and a new direction, but without a bass player, and embroiled in a legal dispute over distribution due to SST&#x27;s issuing &quot;Damaged&quot; (Ginn argued that since MCA was no longer involved, the Unicorn deal was not legally binding, while Unicorn disagreed and sued SST and Black Flag). Until the matter was sorted out, the band were prevented by a court injunction from using the name &quot;Black Flag&quot; on any recordings. They released a compilation record, &quot;Everything Went Black&quot;, which was credited to the individual musicians, not &quot;Black Flag&quot;. In fact, wherever the original album artwork had the words &quot;Black Flag&quot;, they had been covered up with small slips of paper, thus adhering to the letter of the law.

After Unicorn Records declared bankruptcy, Black Flag were released from the injunction, and returned with a vengeance, starting with the release of &quot;My War&quot;. The album was both a continuation of &quot;Damaged&quot;, and a vast leap forward. While the general mood and lyrics continue in the confrontational and emotional tone of &quot;Damaged&quot;, the album would prove influential to grunge music as the decade progressed. Lacking a bass player, Ginn played bass guitar, using the pseudonym Dale Nixon. On the May 1, 2007 episode of his radio program &quot;Harmony in My Head&quot;, Rollins reported that one of Ginn&#x27;s favorite albums during this era was Mahavishnu Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; (1973), and opined that John McLaughlin&#x27;s guitar work influenced Ginn.

Freed legally to release albums, Black Flag was re-energized and ready to continue full steam ahead. The band recruited bassist Kira Roessler (sister of punk keyboardist Paul Roessler, of 45 Grave) to replace Dukowski, and began its most prolific period.

1984 saw Black Flag (and the SST label) at their most ambitious. This year they would release three full-length albums, and toured nearly constantly, with Rollins noting 178 performances for the year, and about that many for 1985. With Dukowski gone, Ginn ceded much of the spotlight to Rollins, who had expressed some discomfort over being the group&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; spokesman, while Ginn was the recognized leader (Ginn wrote the majority of the group&#x27;s songs and lyrics).

With Roessler on board, Black Flag began earnest experimentation, sometimes to critical and audience disdain: One critic writes that &quot;Slip It In&quot; &quot;blurs the line between moronic punk and moronic metal&quot;; another writes &quot;My War&quot; is &quot;a pretentious mess of a record with a totally worthless second side.&quot; Rollins reports that Black Flag&#x27;s set-lists in this era rarely included older crowd favorites like &quot;Six Pack&quot; or &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;, and that audiences were often irritated by the new, slower Black Flag. Violence against the band (and especially Rollins) was ever-present, although the vocalist was now an avid weight lifter, and more than able to defend himself. Furthermore, to Rollins&#x27; chagrin, Ginn&#x27;s interest in marijuana steadily increased; as Rollins put it, &quot;By &#x27;86 it was &#x27;Cannot separate the man from his Anvil case with a big-ass stash.&#x27;&quot; Despite the initial resistance to the new music and quasi-psychedelic direction, &quot;My War&quot; would later be cited as a formative influence on the grunge, stoner and sludge metal genres. The band would continue to evolve toward a more heavy metal sound, with 1985&#x27;s &quot;Loose Nut&quot; featuring more polished production.

===Later period and break up (1985–1986)===
Despite 1984–85 being the most fruitful period for the band and their record label, Ginn and Rollins would ultimately decide to eject Roessler from Black Flag, citing erratic behavior. It has also been suggested that Ginn&#x27;s accommodating Roessler&#x27;s college schedule created tension in the band. Her absence, and the lack of a steady drummer (Stevenson quit and was replaced by Anthony Martinez), contributed to the comparatively weak reputation of the last few Black Flag tours.

By 1986, Black Flag&#x27;s members had grown tired of the tensions of their relentless touring schedule, infighting, and of living in near-poverty. The band had been together almost a decade, and true commercial success and stability had eluded them. The band&#x27;s erratic artistic changes were a barrier to their retaining an audience – Ginn was so creatively restless that Black Flag&#x27;s albums were often very dissimilar. At one point, Rollins apparently said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we make a record that was like the last one so people won&#x27;t always be trying to catch up with what we&#x27;re doing?&quot; The next album, &quot;In My Head&quot;, with its powerful bluesy proto-grunge-metal, did seem to finally be a cohesive follow-up to their previous album &quot;Loose Nut&quot;, but it would be their last.

Black Flag played its final show on June 27, 1986, in Detroit, Michigan. In his book &quot;Get in the Van&quot;, Rollins wrote that Ginn telephoned him in August 1986: &quot;He told me he was quitting the band. I thought that was strange considering it was his band and all. So in one short phone call, it was all over.&quot;

===Post-Black Flag and reunions (1987–2012)===

Since Black Flag&#x27;s break-up, Rollins has had the most visible public profile as a musician, writer, and actor. Most Black Flag members have also remained active in music, especially Ginn, who continued playing with bands such as Gone, October Faction, Screw Radio, and Stevenson, who continued on with the Descendents, All, Only Crime, and the reformed Lemonheads. Kira Roessler continues to record and perform with the band dos, a duet with former husband and one time Minutemen bassist Mike Watt.

In September 2003, Black Flag played three reunion shows, two at the Hollywood Palladium and one at Alex&#x27;s Bar in Long Beach, California, to benefit cat rescue organizations (a current passion of Ginn&#x27;s). The line-up for the shows was Dez Cadena on vocals and guitar, Greg Ginn on guitar, Robo on drums, and C&#x27;el Revuelta on bass. Professional skateboarder and singer Mike Vallely also sang all the songs from &quot;My War&quot; at these shows while Gregory Moore was on drums for the My War set.

On July 24, 2010, in celebration of Ron Reyes&#x27;s 50th birthday, Greg Ginn and Reyes played a set of three Black Flag songs together in addition to his own set with the Ron Reyes Band.

On December 18, 2011, Keith Morris, Chuck Dukowski, Bill Stevenson, and the Descendents&#x27; Stephen Egerton played the &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; EP in its entirety for the Goldenvoice 30th anniversary show called GV 30. This surprise gig at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium took place between sets by the Vandals and the Descendents.

===Official reformation, Flag, &quot;What The...&quot;, and trademark infringement suit (2013–present)===
On January 25, 2013, it was announced that guitarist Greg Ginn and vocalist Ron Reyes would reform Black Flag, joined by Gregory Moore on drums, and &#x27;Dale Nixon&#x27; on bass (Dale Nixon is a pseudonym sometimes used by Ginn, most prominently as the bassist on &quot;My War&quot;). The band would tour as well as release a new album, their first since 1985&#x27;s &quot;In My Head&quot;. In March, it was announced that Screeching Weasel bassist Dave Klein had joined the band. On May 2, 2013, the band released a new song entitled &quot;Down in the Dirt&quot; through their website. After releasing two more singles (&quot;The Chase&quot; and &quot;Wallow in Despair&quot;), &quot;What The...&quot; was released on December 3, and was poorly received by critics and fans.

Around the same time, it was announced that the lineup that played at GV 30, Morris, Dukowski, Stevenson and Egerton, would tour performing Black Flag songs, under the name FLAG. It was later announced that the lineup would be joined by Dez Cadena.

On August 2, 2013, SST Records and Greg Ginn brought a trademark infringement action in Los Angeles federal court against Morris, Dukowski, Stevenson, Cadena, and Egerton, with regard to their use of the name Black Flag and the Black Flag logo on the 2013 Flag tour. In the same action, SST and Ginn also sued Henry Rollins and Keith Morris to oppose and cancel the trademark applications filed in September 2012 by Rollins and Morris. SST and Ginn alleged that Rollins and Morris lied to the Patent and Trademark Office on their trademark applications regarding claimed use of the Black Flag name and logo by Rollins and Morris on records, T-shirts, and with regard to live performances.

In October 2013, a federal judge denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, brought by Ginn and SST against Morris, Dukowski, Stevenson, Cadena, and Egerton. The court ruled that it was possible that the logo had fallen into &quot;generic use&quot;, but did not rule specifically that it had done so. The court also ruled that Ginn and SST could not prevent the use of the band name &quot;Flag&quot;, as it was likely that fans would know the difference between the two acts, because of widespread publicity.

During a show in November 2013 on Black Flag&#x27;s Australian tour, pro skater and band manager Mike Vallely, who previously sang with the band in 2003, came on stage, took Reyes&#x27; microphone, ousted him from Black Flag and sang the band&#x27;s last two songs. Reyes said he was relieved to be removed from the band, citing difficulties working with Ginn. In January 2014, Vallely was named the band&#x27;s new lead singer. Vallely apologized for the band&#x27;s antics in 2013 and revealed that the band had begun working on material for a new album with a tour to tentatively begin in May. Shortly after the announcement, Dave Klein announced he too was leaving the band. In 2014, Ginn filled out the line up with adding new members Tyler Smith on bass, and Brandon Pertzborn on drums. They embarked upon the Victimology Tour, bringing along Ginn&#x27;s own HOR and Brooklyn band Cinema Cinema, as openers.

On January 28, 2019, it was announced that Black Flag would play their first show in five years at the Sabroso Craft Beer, Taco &amp; Music Festival in Dana Point, California, on April 7. The show would be the start of a U.S. tour. The band&#x27;s first U.K. tour in 35 years was set to follow in October. The new lineup consisted of Greg Ginn on guitar, Mike Vallely on vocals, Tyler Smith on bass, and Isaias Gil on drums.

On December 10, 2022, Black Flag announced that they would be touring North America, in which they will be performing their second studio album, &quot;My War&quot;, in its entirety.

At a gig in Garden Grove a day before the No Values Festival in Pomona, California, Black Flag played a show featuring new bass player Matt Baxter, who Mike Vallely had released a folk single called &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; with in 2020 as a duo called The Morning Trail on which Baxter player guitar and Vallely sang. Matt Baxter is replacing previous bass player Harley Duggan.

==Style and legacy==
Black Flag are primarily a hardcore punk band and are considered to be one of the first hardcore punk bands. According to Ryan Cooper of About.com and author Doyle Greene, Black Flag is one of the pioneers of the genre for the experimental style they later started playing. Black Flag experimented with a sludge metal sound on their album &quot;My War&quot;. Black Flag also have used elements of styles such as jazz, blues, spoken word, heavy metal, blues rock, free jazz, math rock, and .

Throughout their ten-year career as a band, Black Flag&#x27;s experiences became legendary, especially in the Southern California area. Much of the band&#x27;s history is chronicled in Henry Rollins&#x27; own published tour diary &quot;Get in the Van&quot;. Black Flag were reportedly blacklisted by the LAPD and Hollywood rock clubs because of the destructiveness of their fans, though Rollins has claimed that police caused far more problems than they solved.

SST Records, an independent American record label that was initially founded to release Black Flag&#x27;s debut single, released recordings by influential bands such as Bad Brains, Minutemen, Descendents, Meat Puppets, and Hüsker Dü. As well, SST released some albums by Negativland, Soundgarden, Sonic Youth, and Saint Vitus.
SST was founded in 1966 by Greg as Solid State Transmitters – later rebranded to release Black Flag albums.

Black Flag&#x27;s career is chronicled in &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot;, a study of several important American underground rock bands. Many members of the grunge scene cited Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;My War&quot; album as being influential in their departure from the standard punk model. Steve Turner of Mudhoney stated in an interview, &quot;A lot of other people around the country hated the fact that Black Flag slowed down ... but up here it was really great – we were like &#x27;Yay!&#x27; They were weird and fucked-up sounding.&quot;
Kurt Cobain listed both &quot;My War&quot; and &quot;Damaged&quot; in his top 50 albums in his journal in 1993. Jeff Hanneman and Dave Lombardo, both known for their work with Slayer, mentioned Black Flag among their influences. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea has a Black Flag decal on one of his signature Modulus bass guitars, and guitarist John Frusciante has cited Greg Ginn as one of his early influences as a guitar player. British acoustic artist and punk rocker Frank Turner has a Black Flag icon tattoo on his wrist and cites the band as one of his primary inspirations, particularly in regards to their work ethic. With Million Dead, if anything went wrong with their tour, Turner said they would &quot;Think Black Flag&quot;. Vocalist Maynard James Keenan of the bands Tool and A Perfect Circle, has described seeing Black Flag perform in 1986 as a young punk rocker in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as a &quot;revelatory and life-changing&quot; experience. A Perfect Circle also covered the Black Flag song &quot;Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie&quot; on their &quot;Emotive&quot; album. Punk band Rise Against portrayed Black Flag in the 2005 &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot; film, and their cover of &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; is on the &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot; soundtrack. Rise Against also does a cover of the Black Flag song &quot;Fix Me&quot; in the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;. Initial Records released a Black Flag cover album in 2002 (re-released with additional tracks in 2006 by ReIgnition Recordings), &quot;Black on Black: A Tribute to Black Flag&quot;. The compilation features 15 hardcore and metalcore bands – including Most Precious Blood, Converge, the Dillinger Escape Plan, American Nightmare, Drowningman, and Coalesce. Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oliver Sykes also mentioned Black Flag as one of his biggest influences. Sykes has also had the tattoo of Black Flag logo showing the love for the band. American alternative rock band My Chemical Romance has also stated that the band has been heavily influenced by Black Flag.

==Iconography==

Black Flag&#x27;s visual imagery and artwork complemented the themes found in the band&#x27;s music. Greg Ginn&#x27;s brother Raymond Ginn, under the pseudonym Raymond Pettibon, created the artwork for all of the band&#x27;s studio releases with the exceptions of &quot;Damaged&quot; and the &quot;TV Party&quot; single, as well as providing artwork for the band members to transform into merchandise and gig flyers. When the band found it necessary to change their name from Panic in 1978, it was Pettibon who suggested the new name Black Flag and designed their iconic logo: four vertical black rectangles comprising a stylized rippling black flag. The logo evoked a number of meanings: it was the polar opposite of a white flag of surrender, as well as a symbol for anarchism and a traditional emblem of pirates. At the same time, Rollins disavowed the claim that the logo represented anarchy, stating in a 1985 interview that it means &quot;Anything that you want it to. I guess it&#x27;s the opposite of the white flag too, which is the flag of surrender. A lot of people think that it means &#x27;Anarchy&#x27; but it doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

As the band gained popularity the logo was graffitied on numerous highway overpasses and other public and private surfaces in and around Los Angeles, drawing the attention of the authorities and contributing to an increase in police presence at Black Flag shows.

Pettibon&#x27;s artwork for the band&#x27;s albums and flyers was equally stark and confrontational. He typically worked in one panel using only pen and ink, so the message conveyed had to be direct and powerful due to lack of space and color. According to Michael Azerrad in &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot;, the artwork &quot;was a perfect visual analogue to the music it promoted – gritty, stark, violent, smart, provocative, and utterly American.&quot; It also provided a cerebral aspect to the band&#x27;s image: as the mainstream media caricatured Black Flag as a mindlessly aggressive act, the pairing of their music with high-concept artwork hinted at a greater intelligence at work that was unknown to outsiders.

Henry Rollins, in his journal collection &quot;Get in the Van&quot;, notes that Pettibon&#x27;s artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: &quot;The record&#x27;s cover art said it all. A man with his back to the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up every day of my life.&quot; Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the &quot;Police Story&quot; single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb &quot;Make me come, faggot!&quot; The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that &quot;my values are relativistic, and I&#x27;ll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that&#x27;s me with my gat – my gat&#x27;s larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my .357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat. I&#x27;ll listen to his whimpering cries.&quot;

After joining the band Rollins would sometimes watch Pettibon draw, admiring his work ethic and the fact that he did not make telephone calls or sit for interviews. The drawings themselves rarely bore a direct connection to the music or its lyrical themes. Pettibon himself recalls that:

Pettibon also sold pamphlet books of his work through SST, with titles such as &quot;Tripping Corpse&quot;, &quot;New Wave of Violence&quot;, and &quot;The Bible, the Bottle, and the Bomb&quot;, and did artwork for other SST acts such as Minutemen.

In order to adapt Pettibon&#x27;s artwork to meet the layout requirements of their albums and flyers, the members of Black Flag would alter it by cutting and pasting and adding their name, logo, and gig details to it. They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls going out on a flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of paste onto a telephone pole, stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste so that it would last for up to a year. The band members and their crew would do this for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance. Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band&#x27;s treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free. &quot;To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would come back to me scrawled upon and taped over or whited out, and I&#x27;d always ask nicely, &#x27;Could you please make a copy of this first and then do that?&#x27; Their master tapes were deemed sacrosanct, while my work was seen as completely disposable, but I&#x27;m not venting or complaining, just stating fact.&quot; Pettibon also felt pigeonholed by his association with the band, and had a falling out with them in 1985 over artwork used on the cover of the &quot;Loose Nut&quot; album, which had been used for a flyer several years earlier. Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer Bill Stevenson to do the layout, who cut it into pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, although his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band&#x27;s career.

<text>The Conservation Volunteers (TCV) is a British charity that connects people to green spaces through volunteering, focused on environmental conservation through practical tasks undertaken by volunteers. Until 1 May 2012, it traded as BTCV – British Trust for Conservation Volunteers).

==History==

===The Conservation Corps===
In 1959 the (then) Council for Nature appointed Brigadier Armstrong to form the Conservation Corps, with the objective of involving young volunteers, over the age of 16, in practical conservation work. The corp&#x27;s first project was at Box Hill, Surrey, where 42 volunteers cleared dogwood to encourage the growth of juniper and distinctive chalk downland flora. One of the volunteers present was David Bellamy, who went on to become a Vice President of BTCV.

By 1964 the Conservation Corps had expanded its activities to include education and amenity work in the countryside. In 1966 it moved from a basement office at Queens Gate, Kensington, to new premises at London Zoo in Regent&#x27;s Park. In 1968 the first training course for volunteers was held. By 1969 membership had increased to 600, and volunteers completed around 6,000 workdays a year. The first ever international exchange visit to Czechoslovakia that year became the forerunner for the International Project Programme of today.

===The British Trust for Conservation Volunteers===
In 1970 the Conservation Corps started to operate under the new name of British Trust for Conservation Volunteers (BTCV), with Prince Philip as Patron and Sir David Attenborough as Vice President. In 1971 the local group affiliation scheme was launched.
* In 1975 the BTCV Membership scheme was started
* In 1984 BTCV moved its headquarters to Wallingford, Oxfordshire, while the former BTCV Scotland region was established as a separate charity, registered in Scotland and headquartered at Balallan House, Stirling. Operating under the new name of The Scottish Conservation Projects Trust (SCP), with Prince Charles as Royal Visitor, SCP continued the work of BTCV in Scotland until 31 March, 2002, when SCP ceased trading and BTCV resumed its former role in Scotland.
* In 1998, BTCV joins forces with Dr William Bird of Sonning Common Health Centre in Oxfordshire to introduce the BTCV Green Gym project.

===BTCV===
The organisation underwent a second change of identity in 2000, taking the initialism BTCV as its new name in full. 
* In August 2006 BTCV moved to its present headquarters in Doncaster. The new &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; building features a sedum-covered roof – hence its name – Sedum House. The Scottish office is in Stirling and the Northern Ireland office in Belfast.

===The Conservation Volunteers===

In May 2012, BTCV rebranded under the trading name The Conservation Volunteers (TCV).

In 2014, TCV welcomed Sir Jonathon Porritt as President.

In 2024, His Majesty The King became The Conservation Volunteers&#x27; new Royal Patron.

Sometimes termed &quot;Kofferdam&quot; (from German), it was designed in the United States in 1864 by . It is used mainly in endodontic, fixed prosthodontic (crowns, bridges) and general restorative treatments. Its purpose is both to prevent saliva interfering with the dental work (e.g. contamination of oral micro-organisms during root canal therapy, or to keep filling materials such as composite dry during placement and curing), and to prevent instruments and materials from being inhaled, swallowed or damaging the mouth. In dentistry, use of a rubber dam is sometimes referred to as &quot;isolation&quot; or &quot;moisture control&quot;.

Dental dams are also used for safer oral sex.

== Dentistry ==
=== Background ===
The technique used to apply the dental dam is selected according to the tooth requiring treatment. Several techniques can be used including single tooth isolation, multiple tooth isolation or split dam technique. The dental dam is prepared by punching one or more holes in the dental dam sheet to enable isolation of the appropriate number of teeth required for the dental procedure. The dental dam is then applied to the tooth, anchored into place using a metal or flexible plastic clamp (chosen according to the tooth and area it will be applied to). The clamp will ideally fit snugly around the tooth along the margin of the gingiva, stabilising the dental dam and preventing contamination of the working area due to saliva ingress. Individuals may experience subjective discomfort due to the tight sensation of the dam clamp, therefore topical anaesthetic (liquid or gel) may be applied to the gingiva at the operator&#x27;s discretion prior to applying the dental dam.

===History===

Prior to the use of the rubber dam isolation method, many dental procedures had a high risk of contamination from saliva and bacteria infiltrating the tooth during a procedure. This can lead to the failure of the treatment being undertaken which can result in further interventions or the loss of a tooth. 
Dr Sanford C. Barnum was the original designer of the dental dam as a way to keep the operation site clear from saliva. It was in 1882 that Dr S. S. White improved the design further by adjusting the hole punched into the sheet. In spite of these changes, it was found to be difficult to stabilise the dam around the tooth until Dr. Delous Palmer developed the metal clamps which anchors the dam around the selected tooth. These clamps are available in various shapes and sizes which are designed to fit different tooth structures and morphology.

===Applications===

There are several treatments where dental dam can be applied; dental restorations, endodontic treatments including root canal therapy, fissure sealants, preparation of dental crown, dental implant and some veneer placements.

There is an ongoing controversy with the use and efficacy of rubber dam among dental practitioners. Some practitioners may routinely employ its use, for others it may only be applied during selective treatments whereas many others will avoid its application altogether. Although the use of rubber dam is considered a standard of care, studies showed that a large number of dental practitioners do not utilise it during procedures. 

===Armamentarium===

The set up of a rubber dam has many elements and involves the use of specific tools and accessories which usually consist of:
* Rubber dam sheets
* Clamps or hooks 
* Frame
* Forceps
* Dam Punch
* Dental floss

Other materials that may be used to assist with the setting up of rubber dam are: 
* OralSeal
* Wooden wedges
* Wedjets

===Rubber dam application===

The dental dam sheets are predominantly made from rubber materials such as latex or nitrile and tend to be 15 cm by 15 cm in length and width. The thickness of each dam sheet is approximately between 0.14 mm and 0.38 mm but the size, shape, colour and material that the dam sheet is made from can vary with differing manufacturers. Most manufacturers will also make dental dam sheet alternatives that are suitable for patients with allergies to materials such as latex and some may even make alternatives that can be autoclaved.

The dental dam is anchored around the crown of the tooth using a metal clamp to seal and secure the rubber dam sheet to the tooth or teeth that are receiving treatment during the dental procedure. The clamps come in a variety of shapes and sizes which suit the anatomy of the different teeth in the mouth. Before placing the dam in the mouth dental professionals may choose to secure dental floss around the clamps; this acts as an anchor to prevent aspiration or swallowing. It can also provide a point of reference for the clinician to be able to visualise and retrieve the clamp if it dislodges from the tooth or the dam forceps.

The purpose of the rubber dam frame is to keep the dam sheet taut around target areas; this will ensure that a clinician can work effectively on the tooth without the dam sheet obstructing vision and becoming entangled in dental instruments during the procedure. There are several types of dental dam frames which have an array of purposes. The frames are made from stainless steel, polypropylene or other polymer plastics. Irrespective of the material the dam frame is made from, the frame will always have small pins on the outer edges which act to secure the dam sheet to the frame. The plastic dam frames are predominantly used in the case where dental radiography is planned as they are less radiodense, ensuring the frame appears radiolucent to avoid superimposition of the frame in the radiograph.

The dam punch is a tool used to perforate holes of various sizes into the dental dam sheet. When punching holes in the rubber dam prior to a procedure the size and spacing of the teeth to be isolated should be taken into consideration. In multi-tooth isolation, the holes should correspond to the curve of the dental arch. The rubber dam armamentarium can be set up in a variety of ways; this usually depends on clinician preference and education.

In difficult clinical cases, the standard dental clamp needs to be adapted. One efficient method is using the carved gypsum cast as described by NCE Cazacu.

=== Advantages ===
Using a rubber dam for dental procedures can provide multiple advantages. A rubber dam can provide a clean and dry operating field away from substances such as saliva and blood. This is important for dental procedures as the bonding ability of adhesives and cements is heightened in a clean and dry field away from possible contamination, in order for maximum adhesive strength between the restorative materials, dentin and enamel. If the environment is contaminated leading to poor bonding of the materials, the success and longevity of the restoration is shortened.

When using the rubber dam, it is possible to isolate one or more teeth. By doing this, the clinicians visibility of the tooth is greatly improved, due to the increase in contrast with the rubber dam around the tooth or teeth, whilst at the same time it retracts the soft tissues such as the lips, tongue, and cheeks, and reduces mirror fogging:allowing the clinician to focus solely on the restorative site, which can lead to the procedure also being more time-efficient. Even though it is commonly said that the rubber dam takes too much time to apply, in many ways it can reduce the time needed for the procedure, as not only does it isolate the tooth, it reduces the ability for the patient to communicate with the clinician. This is most beneficial for the over talkative patients which can sometimes hinder the efficiency of treatment and can instead allow more time for the clinician to focus on the task at hand in order for the procedure to take less time.

A Cochrane review in 2021 suggests that the use of rubber dam as an isolation method provides a chance for dental restorations to last longer. Disregarding the fact that it is low-quality evidence, there is still proof that over a two-year period, comparing restorations done using rubber dams versus cotton roll isolation, the rubber dam group had a lower risk of failure with a risk ratio of 0.80 compared to cotton roll isolation at 1.19, however, further research is needed on varying restorative treatments.

Additionally, a rubber dam can act as an infection control barrier and reduce the risk of cross-contamination and infection. In case the patient may have a contagious disease the rubber dam decreases the chance of the splatter of microbial content if the patient were to cough or the spread of microbes being caused by the pressure from the triplex, which is a tube or syringe used to deliver air or water under pressure.

A rubber dam can also protect patients&#x27; airways. It does not eliminate the chance, but decreases the possibility of the patient accidentally swallowing or inhaling restorative instruments, tooth fragments or debris. [10] That has happened in the past, and should this occur, the patient must always be admitted into hospital as a chest X-ray is necessary in order to discover where the inhalant may be and whether it may potentially need to be removed on the operating table or not. As it has potential to be life-threatening if ignored.

Not only instruments or debris, but also chemical materials used in dental procedures (such as acid etch, seals, and amalgam) can have harmful effects. In endodontic procedures, corrosive irrigants are contained such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach). Without the protection of a rubber dam, there is an increased risk of this chemical damaging the soft tissues of the mouth and being more harmful if swallowed. Another example is during amalgam restorations, as amalgam contains the element mercury, and if ingested during the placing of amalgam can cause potentially harmful side effects if not treated. However, after amalgam is placed safely, evidence does suggest the exposure to mercury is at a level which is non-harmful and safe for the human body.
The rubber dam can also offer additional protection of the soft tissues of oral mucosa from sharp instruments, acting as a barrier between the instrument and the soft tissue. Additionally, associated with rubber dam is a caulking adhesive, caulking in definition is a material used to seal joints, in this can be used to fill in gaps between the rubber dam and gingiva as it adheres to the wet rubber dam or mucosal tissues, acting as another mode of protection.

A big issue surrounding the rubber dam is its use as part of a legal obligation. In some parts of the world, the use of a rubber dam is obligatory for procedures such as endodontic treatment. The reason for this is that if an injury was to occur or possible cross-contamination and the result could have been prevented by rubber dam, this situation is regarded as medico-legally indefensible, meaning the clinician will not be able to defend themselves in court due to the duty of care falling under negligence of the patient.

Lastly, some patients, in fact, prefer using the rubber dam, as having been told and understanding the risks instead feel more comfortable knowing they are safer with it than without it, as well as feeling dissociated from the noises happening around them such as the drilling. Additionally, some patients tend to be more comfortable as they may prefer the feeling of not having water and suction running within their mouths.

=== Disadvantages ===
Although there are many advantages of rubber dams during dental treatment there are also associated risks and disadvantages. The rubber dam can take extra time to apply; however, with consistent practice and use by the dental practitioner, this may not have an effect on the length of the appointment. Insufficient training and the inconvenience of application can also be a deterrent for its use and can also contribute to lost time. The cost of dental dams is an expense to the dental practice and could also be a disincentive. Although the rubber dams are inexpensive to purchase, initial costs for the armamentarium can be high.

There is a risk of rubber dam clamps breaking during application due to the chemical effects of sodium hypochlorite, an antimicrobial solution used during root canal treatments, repeated stresses of clinical use, or autoclaving, all of which can potentially weaken the material. To avoid swallowing or aspiration of broken clamps, the dental practitioner should place floss around the clamp to allow its retrieval if it snaps or springs off during a procedure.

As the dental dam clamp is placed along the gum line, this can cause some discomfort or pain (especially in a patient who does not require local anaesthesia), bleeding from the gums, damage to the periodontal ligament or abrasion of the cementum on the root of the tooth, which may cause an uneven surface on the tooth root that can retain plaque.

The dental dam is placed over the mouth, effectively blocking off the airway, which means the patient must be able to comfortably breathe through their nose. This is a problem for patients with nasal airway obstruction such as the common cold, a broken nose, adenoids, recurring sinus issues, or those who habitually breathe through their mouths. Patients can also find that communication is reduced between the dental practitioner and themselves, which may result in feelings of claustrophobia, vulnerability, and anxiety. Those prone to dental phobia and individuals who have learning difficulties, disabilities or special needs may find the use of dental dams impossible and intolerable.

To an extent, the use of a dental dam may lead to visual distortion of tooth morphology since the other teeth and the rest of the mouth are hidden from view. This may lead to perforation if an access cavity is incorrectly angled during root canal therapy. For this reason, endodontists may routinely begin their access cavity before applying the dam. This will ensure the correct orientation prior to commencing removal of the blood vessels, nerve tissue and other cellular entities from the tooth.

The rubber dam, which is usually brightly coloured (blue or green), may alter the apparent colour of the tooth, which can lead to incorrect choice of shade, e.g. during placement of a dental composite during a restorative procedure. For this reason, dental practitioners should select the appropriate shade of material prior to the application of rubber dam.

As the rubber dams are primarily made of latex, patients may experience reactions which range from uncomfortable (allergic contact dermatitis, allergic contact cheilitis, allergic contact stomatitis) to life-threatening (anaphylaxis). Nitrile versions are available for those with latex allergies and adverse reactions can be avoided by patients informing dental practitioners of latex allergies prior to treatment or adverse reactions after rubber dam application.

==Oral sex==

Dental dams are sometimes suggested for use as a physical barrier against the exchange of body fluids during cunnilingus and anilingus, especially for women who have sex with women to protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, they are rarely used for this purpose, and as of 2012, there is no evidence that their use reduces the risk of STI transmission, including the risk of HIV infection.

After lubrication with a water-based lubricant, an unpunctured dental dam may be held over the vulva or anus, allowing oral stimulation of these areas without transmission of bodily fluids or direct physical contact. Plastic cling wrap, condoms (repurposed by cutting off the tip and ring and cutting them lengthwise) or latex gloves (cut open longitudinally) can be used for STI protection in a similar manner as a dental dam, by providing a physical barrier to cover the vulvar or anal areas during oral sex and these alternative barrier methods are more affordable and readily available than dental dams.
Dental dams were initially promoted in the 1980s in some safer sex campaigns as a barrier to prevent transmission of STIs during oral sex. They were introduced for use in some women&#x27;s prisons in Canada and Australia (in the jurisdictions of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia) in the 1990s as a form of sexual barrier protection after the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that female prisoners should have access to dental dams. Inmates have reported numerous problems with dental dam use, including the dam being too thick, lack of availability, poor taste, and reduced sensations when used for oral sex. Dental dams are often reappropriated by prison inmates for other uses, such as hair elastics, placemats or shoelaces. They are relatively expensive and difficult to obtain outside of the prison system. Rubber dams are not manufactured, marketed, registered, tested, or evaluated for their effectiveness as an STI prevention aid, and no studies exist () on their permeability to STI pathogens.

A 2022 NIH study found that &quot;[d]ental dams can be an invaluable tool for safe oral sex, and it is important for patients to know how to use them properly[...]Although dental dams have been associated with a reduction in STIs, the lack of statistical significance may thus be explained in part by small sample sizes[...]From experience with patients in the STI clinic, the authors advise purchasing dental dams made specifically for oral sex because these are thinner than even the thinnest dental dams available for oral surgery[...]At this time, it is unclear if dental dams play a statistically significant role in decreasing incidence and transmission of STIs based on the current literature; this may be accounted for by factors, such as a paucity of data, infrequent use due to sparse patient education, perceived barriers to procurement and accessibility, and unfamiliarity on the part of providers. Condoms have repeatedly been shown to decrease STI risk; it is likely that dental dams will decrease risk as well when extrapolating the aforementioned data on condoms. Yet, there is a clear need for more provisional research on dental dams to ascertain their usage, perceived barriers, and efficacy in STI prevention.&quot;

<text>&quot;One for the Angels&quot; is the second episode of the American anthology television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on October 9, 1959, on CBS television.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Lew Bookman is a kindly sidewalk pitchman who sells and repairs toys, notions, and trinkets, and is adored by the neighborhood children. One day, Bookman is visited by Mr. Death, who tells him that he is to die at midnight of natural causes. Unable to dissuade Death by convincing him he has great achievements in the works that must be completed, Bookman eventually convinces him to wait until he has made his greatest sales pitch: &quot;one for the angels&quot;. After Death has agreed to the extension and asks when this grand pitch might take place, Bookman announces he is retiring, smug that he has successfully cheated Death. Death concedes Bookman has found a loophole in their agreement, but warns that someone else now has to die in his place. Death chooses Maggie, a little girl who lives in Bookman&#x27;s apartment building and is a friend of his.

Maggie is hit by a truck and falls into a coma; Death intends to be in her room at the stroke of midnight to claim her. Bookman begs Death to take him instead, but Death is adamant; a deal is a deal. That night as midnight approaches, Bookman gets out his wares and begins to eloquently boost one item after another, making the greatest sales pitch of his life — one so great that he seemingly entices Death himself to buy item after item until all of the wares in his case are sold. With one minute remaining before midnight, he offers his &quot;&quot;, he pitches himself as the ultimate manservant in order to convince Death to take him in Maggie&#x27;s place. Midnight passes and Death misses his appointment with Maggie. Maggie awakens and, as her doctor leaves the apartment and sees Bookman, he assures him that Maggie will live.

Death observes that by making that great sales pitch, Bookman has met the original terms of their deal. Now content and willing to accept his fate, Bookman goes to leave with Death. He fetches his case of wares to bring with him, remarking that &quot;you never know who might need something up there&quot;. He looks to Death, adding hopefully, &quot;Up there?&quot; and Death replies, &quot;Up there, Mr. Bookman. You made it.&quot;

<text>Scouting in Illinois has served youth since 1909. The state was the home of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) founder, William D. Boyce.

==Early history (1910 – 1950)==
In 1946, the National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meeting was held at Chanute Field.

==Recent history (1950 – Present)==

The 1963 and 1971 National Order of the Arrow Conferences were held at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

In 2007, Lincoln Trails Council ran a Scoutreach program in inner city areas. Boys are offered constructive, fun activities and learn about scouting.

The Lewis and Clark Council was formed from the 2009 merger of Okaw Valley Council (OVC) and Trails West Council (TWC). The Lewis &amp; Clark council had its headquarters in Belleville, Illinois. The council owned four camps: Camp Joy in Carlyle, Illinois, Camp Sunnen in Potosi, Missouri, Camp Warren Levis in Godfrey, Illinois, and Camp Vandeventer in Waterloo, Illinois. There were six districts in the Lewis &amp; Clark Council: the Illini District, Black Gold District, Kaskaskia District, Cahokia Mounds District, Piasa Bird District, and St. Clair District. Okaw Valley Council and the Trails West Council merged in 2009 to create the Lewis &amp; Clark Council.

The two councils from which Lewis &amp; Clark was formed were themselves the product of mergers. The Trails West Council was founded in 1991 when the Piasa Bird Council and the Cahokia Mounds Council joined. The Okaw Valley Council was somewhat older at the time of the merger; it was formed in 1965 following the consolidation of the Kaskaskia Council and the Mississippi Valley Council.

In April 2014, the following councils announced that they would merge:
* Calumet Council
* Chicago Area Council
* Des Plaines Valley Council
* Northwest Suburban Council
The merged council was named the Pathway to Adventure Council.

In September 2016 the Lewis and Clark Council voted to merge with the Greater St. Louis Area Council, effective January 1, 2017.

The Lincoln Trails Council had its headquarters in Decatur, Illinois, and was served by Woapink Lodge #167 (founded in 1955). The council merged into the Greater Saint Louis Area Council on January 1, 2019.

<doc id="103373" wikidata="Q1585827" url="?curid=103373" title="Kutini-Payamu (Iron Range) National Park">
<text>Kutini-Payamu (Iron Range) is a National Park located in Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane and east of Weipa in the Cape York Peninsula, Queensland. Within the National Park is the Iron Range (Lockhart River Resources Reserve), Scrubby Creek mining site and the Aboriginal Shire of Lockhart River. During World War II several Australian Army units were stationed in the area.

==Birds==
The park is part of the 6,205 km2 McIlwraith and Iron Ranges an Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it is one of the few known sites for the endangered buff-breasted buttonquail. The IBA also supports an isolated population of southern cassowaries as well as populations of lovely fairywrens, silver-crowned friarbirds, yellow, yellow-spotted, white-streaked and banded honeyeaters, and white-browed robins. As well as these, the eclectus parrot subspecies &quot;Eclectus roratus macgillivrayi&quot; is confined to the Iron and McIlwraith Ranges of eastern Cape York Peninsula.

==Other Wildlife==
The national park is a hotspot for flora and fauna, with over 1800 species recorded in the area. Notable species include the green tree python, spotted cuscus, bare-rumped sheathtail bat, and estuarine crocodile. The park represents one of the most diverse protected areas in Australia for butterflies, ants, ferns, orchids and palms. In fact, 60% of Australia&#x27;s butterflies are found in Kutini-Payamu National Park. Making the area a popular tourist destination for wildlife enthusiasts. 

==History==

===Airbases===
In March 1940, Val Augenson of the Department of Civil Aviation inspected a possible site for an Emergency Landing Ground for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He reported to the RAAF that a suitable all-weather Emergency Landing Ground could be built in the area.

On about 18 April 1942, Walter Maiersperger, the Commanding Officer of 33 Bomb Squadron of the United States Army Air Forces 22nd Bomb Group, carried out an aerial reconnaissance flight over the Iron Range area. He had been tasked with surveying coastal airfields in Queensland that would be suitable for operation of the B-26 Marauders used by the 22nd Bomb Group.

Air Commodore Lukis, Air Officer Commanding, North East Area, reported on 28 May 1942, that Pilot Officer Trench, RAAF had inspected the countryside near Portland Roads (also known as Weymouth Bay), with Colonel Mills and Captain Herman G. Cox of the USAAF. Their first attempt to fly to the Iron Range area from Coen was not successful. An engine failed in their Rapide and they returned to Coen. After being repaired they took off the next morning and landed on a beach at low tide a few miles south of Portland Roads. As the plane slowed upon landing on the soft sand the Rapide swung towards the sea. The tips of the propeller started to thrash in the water but the skilful pilot was able to turn the aircraft back onto the beach.

The inspection party reported to Lukis that there were good jetty facilities at Portland Roads but that there was no suitable site for an aerodrome near the jetty. They reported that a fairly extensive site just to the west of Iron Range and east of the Claudie River was suitable for the construction of several airfields. On 7 June 1942, an advance party of the US 46 Engineer General Service Regiment and 26 Operational Base Unit RAAF boarded the SS Wandana in Townsville headed for Portland Roads. 26 OBU arrived at Portland Roads and established radio communications with Townsville on the evening of 10 June 1942.

A few weeks after his initial visit, Jim Trench returned to the Iron Range area with Colonel Mills and observed two American Battalions of Pioneer Engineers busily building the Iron Range runways. They managed to build two 7,000-feet runways and thirteen miles (21 kilometres) of sealed taxiways within three months. On 14 June 1942, Companies A, B and C of the 46th Engineers boarded the MS Dona Nati at Townsville and arrived at Portland Roads on 16 June 1942. Headquarters and Service Company (H &amp; S Company) of the 46th Engineers left Townsville on 10 July 1942 and arrived at Portland Roads on 12 July 1942. On 27 October 1942, Headquarters Detachment of the 46th Engineers left Townsville and arrived at Iron Range on 29 October 1942. The 90th Bombardment Group arrived in Queensland in early November 1942 with their forty-eight (48) B-24D Liberators (variant D). They were initially based as follows at Iron Range, 16 km inland from the port facility of Portland Roads:

<doc id="103379" wikidata="Q1739148" url="?curid=103379" title="Keppel Bay Islands National Park">
<text>Keppel Bay Islands are part of both a national park and a scientific national park in Queensland, Australia, respectively 538 km and 518 km northwest of Brisbane. Keppel Bay Islands National Park includes 13 islands, positioned in Keppel Bay, off the coast of Yeppoon and Emu Park on the Capricorn Coast. The largest island in the Keppel Group, Great Keppel Island, is a popular tourist attraction and not part of the national park.

==North Keppel Island==
From the early 1950s to about 1994, a small resort of about twelve cabins on North Keppel Island was operated by Mr Walls, a former train driver. “Old” Mr Walls was assisted by his daughter, Geraldine, and her husband, who also lived on the island. His son Tim Walls operated the boat service to the island, firstly in a boat called the Somerset, out of Ross Creek, Yeppoon, then in a larger boat called the Keppel Star, out of the Roslyn Bay Boat Harbour.

More recently the island has been run by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

Camping, reef walking, boating, fishing, wildlife watching, diving and snorkelling are all popular activities within the park.

Konomie Island Environmental Education Centre is operated by the Queensland Department of Education. It runs programs for school groups about the environment of North Keppel Island.

<doc id="103380" wikidata="Q1781175" url="?curid=103380" title="Kondalilla National Park">
<text>Kondalilla is a national park in the Blackall Range of South East Queensland, Australia, 91 km north of Brisbane. William Skene founded this area on his property while searching for lost cattle. He named it Bon Accord before giving it to the Queensland Government who, during the fifties, renamed it Kondalilla which is an Aboriginal word for running water. The area was first officially protected in 1906 as a recreational area, becoming a national park in 1945.

Access is easiest by road from Flaxton, east of the park. There is a large picnic area where there are toilet facilities (non potable water). There are two tracks which lead to the upper falls swimming hole. A longer circuit track will take you to the bottom pool which is not suitable for swimming. Allow at least two hours for the circuit trip, which in some places is close to the cliff edge and is not fenced.

Camping in the park is not permitted.

==History==

===Bonyee festival===

For countless generations, the Blackall Range has held spiritual significance for many Aboriginal people throughout South East Queensland.

Abundant bunya pines growing throughout this area produced large nut crops, providing enough food for huge gatherings. When the nut crop peaked every three years, Kabi Kabi and neighbouring Wakka Wakka people hosted the Bonyee Festival. Many invited guests travelled great distances from coastal and inland areas to share food, songs and dances, arrange marriages, and other social interactions. A large grassy area near Baroon Pocket was an important gathering place.

===Pastoralists and timber-getters===

From 1842 until 1860, the Blackall Range was part of a large reserve declared by Governor Gipps to protect the bunya pine food source for local Indigenous groups. It was illegal to settle or clear land where bunya pines occurred.

When reserve status was rescinded, pastoralists and timber-getters came. In the 1880s, prized timber including red cedar, white beech, bunya pine, blackbutt and tallowwood was logged in the Blackall Range. The forest around Kondalilla was logged heavily and the ring-barked trees can still be seen today along the Picnic Creek circuit. Widespread clearing of the tableland forests ensued as settlement proceeded. However, some small areas were set aside for recreation.

===Recreational use===

From the early 1900s, people began visiting this area for its &quot;natural scenery, waterfalls and spectacular views&quot;.

The first area to be protected was Kondalilla—in 1906 it became a recreational area, then a national park in 1945. Since then, reserves have been added across the Blackall Range to protect remnants of its natural communities. Kondalilla National Park (327ha) was linked to Obi Obi National Park in 1988. With other additions, including former State forest, the park has increased in size to 1591ha.

Mapleton Falls (26ha) became a national park in 1973, after being a reserve for recreational and scenic purposes for 38 years. Mapleton National Park (10064ha) was gazetted on 28 March 2014 and is an amalgamation of Mapleton Forest Reserve and Delicia Road Conservation Park.

==Fauna==
The park provides habitat for 107 bird species. It is also home to the rare Pouched Frog. The vulnerable plant species, Macadamia ternifolia, also known as the Bopple Nut, grows in the park.

==Flora==
Protected within the park is remnant subtropical rainforest. The park contains stands of piccabeen palms, pink ash, hoop pines and casuarinas as well as eucalypt forests and rainforest. The stand of bunya pines is the most easterly in Australia.

==Walking Tracks==

The park provides refuge for the Kroombit tinker frog, which has only been found within the park. The species is so rare that estimates of their number only range in the hundreds; , it was estimated fewer than 200 remained in the wild, all in various discrete areas in the rainforest. However, in the same month, the first froglet of this species was bred in captivity at Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, raising hopes that it may be saved from extinction.

In 2013, a new species of marsupial, the silver-headed antechinus, was described, also only found in the national park.

A small population of brumbies roams the park; they are sometimes mustered to reduce numbers.

Abundant in the park is the Kroombit Tops Assassin Spider (&quot;Austrarchaea alani&quot;).

==Crash site==

On 2 August 1994, the wreckage of a United States Army Air Forces Consolidated B-24D Liberator, &quot;Beautiful Betsy&quot;, was discovered in the park. The aircraft had gone missing in stormy weather on 26 February 1945 while on a &quot;Fat Cat&quot; run from Darwin to Brisbane - transporting men and supplies as part of a regular flight. Eight servicemen lost their lives; six of the men were American aviators and two were British Royal Air Force Spitfire pilots. The crash site is well-presented, with a plaque erected by National Parks (approx ).

<doc id="103384" wikidata="Q93830" url="?curid=103384" title="Rinyirru (Lakefield) National Park">
<text>Rinyirru (Lakefield) is a national park in Lakefield, Shire of Cook, Queensland, Australia, 1,707 km northwest of Brisbane and 340 km north-west of Cairns by road, on Cape York Peninsula. At 5,370 km2 (2,073 sq. miles) - making it bigger than Trinidad and Tobago and almost as big as Brunei - Rinyirru is the second largest park in Queensland and a popular place for fishing and camping.

The park stretches from Princess Charlotte Bay in the north to the town of Laura. It covers 537,000 ha of land, and includes sections of the Normanby River, Morehead River and North Kennedy Rivers, as well as lakes, billabongs and wetlands. There are more than 100 permanent riverine lagoons in the park.

There is one main, unsealed road (Lakefield Road) through the park but it is impassable through much of the wet season, when the park closes. There is a ranger station within the park which can assist with information or give help in emergencies.

==Climate==
From early December to April is the wettest time in Rinyirru National Park. The average rainfall is about 1,200 mm. At times monsoon rains fall and cause the rivers to overspill their banks. In the distinctly drier months, the plains of the Laura Basin become parched and dusty.

==History==
Before Europeans settled in the area around the 1870s, numerous Aboriginal clans occupied the fertile coastal strip. Aboriginal cultural heritage sites are located at Hann and Kalpowar crossings.

The first explorer to visit the area by land was Edmund Kennedy. Another early explorer of the region was William Hann. Laura Homestead was established in 1892 or earlier and is one of the oldest, intact, pastoral homesteads in the region. Lakefield Station, extending for over 150 kilometres from Musgrave Station in the north on Princess Charlotte Bay to the northern boundary of Laura Station to the south, an area of about 25,000 km2., ran about 1,500 - 2,000 head of Hereford-cross cattle until about 1964 when its owner, Tarrawinebar Agency, introduced Brahmain bulls into the herd in an effort to improve the breeding stock. The bulls were offloaded from a Scandanvian cattle ship at a dock on Princess Charlotte Bay near the northern border of the Station. Management was also attempting to improve pastures by seeding Townsville lucerne and dividing the station into stock management blocks by means of an extensive fencing program. In 1960 the original Lakefield Homestead was replaced by a new homestead, located a few hundreds of metres to the southeast, and in 1965 the old stockmen&#x27;s quarters were replaced by a new building further to the east, nearer to the airstrip and the horse paddock. At that time the station supported five Caucasian stockmen and several Aboriginal stockmen and their families.

Princess Charlotte Bay in the north to Lakefield was gazetted in 1979, after the Queensland Government purchased several cattle stations, including Lakefield, the previous year. In 2005, a Townsville man was attacked and killed by a crocodile while he was canoeing with his wife at the Midway waterhole on the Normanby River.

==Fauna==
The park is known for its populations of waterbirds such as the brolga, sarus crane, black-necked stork, comb-crested jacana and magpie geese. In the woodland and grassland area the agile wallaby, northern nailtail wallaby and Australian bustard may be found.

Threatened species which are found in the park include the golden-shouldered parrot, star finch, red goshawk, Lakeland Downs mouse and the spectacled hare-wallaby. Termite mounds are scattered across the park, particularly on the Niland Plain.

Reptiles, amphibians and mammals are also present, sometimes in quite large numbers. Mammals include, dingoes, wallabies, possums, foxes, feral cattle and wild pigs. Wild pigs sometimes reach such large numbers that they have to be culled. Reptiles are represented by numerous species of snakes, with the brown snake, death adder and the taipan being the three most dangerous. All three are highly venomous and potentially lethal. Monitor lizards (goannas) are also fairly numerous, especially the yellow-spotted monitor Varanus panoptes. Frogs are also fairly numerous, especially the green tree frog, Litoria caerulea, but there are many others. The introduced cane toad is present in the park, and may be competing with some of the native animals. Other introduced species, such as pigs, cattle and horse roam throughout the park.

Tourists should keep well aware that there are numerous crocodiles in the various waterways of the park. The park has the largest concentration of crocodiles in Queensland. There are two species of crocodile in the park: fresh and saltwater, both of which are native to northern Australia. The freshwater variety are not as big and seek smaller prey and are not so dangerous to humans. The saltwater species can be very large and are potentially dangerous to humans. There have been several crocodile attacks in the park in recent times and some have been fatal. Saltwater crocodiles are a protected species in Australia, and they appear to be breeding successfully, although the habitat is not as suitable as in the Northern Territory where breeding appears to be prolific.

==Flora==
The dominant vegetation in the park is eucalypt woodland and gallery forest associated with waterways. There are a variety of eucalypt species, including bloodwoods and Moreton Bay ash. Wattles are also relatively common including northern black wattle and lancewood (northern golden wattle). Paperbarks are also present especially near water, such as the weeping paperbark. &quot;Melaleuca cajuputi&quot; is also present and has white bottlebrush-type flowers.

One of the attractive species in the park is the beautiful palm, &quot;Corypha utan&quot;. They tend to grow close to waterways and cope well with flooding that occurs during the wet season (monsoon). At the end of the life of the palm, which may be 75 to 100 years, it produces a large terminal inflorescence about a metre high with a prodigious number of flowers. One estimate is that they produce one million flowers. When flowering and seeding is complete the palm dies. Regeneration of Corpyha is quite healthy at Rinyirru. The common name for the palm locally is &quot;Kennedy palm&quot; or &quot;Gebang palm&quot;. &quot;Corypha utan&quot; is confined to Northern Australia but is not endemic, being also found in the Philippines and India. Nearer the coast there are also healthy mangrove ecosystems and salt flats.

==Fishing==
The national park is one of many in Queensland that permit fishing. Fishing is allowed at all campsites and other places with the exception of areas where cultural restrictions apply. Species which may be caught in freshwater include barramundi, tarpon, catfish and tarpin. Saltwater species found in the park include mangrove jack, fingermark, cod, trevally, queenfish and salmon.

==Access==
It can be accessed by road either through Cooktown or Laura. The easiest route is via the Peninsula Development Road north of Lakefield on the Mulligan Highway. The Starcke Track provides another route more popular with four-wheel drive vehicles. A northern route exists from Coen via the Musgrave Roadhouse.

It is remote and visitors should stock up on food, petrol and other supplies before leaving Cooktown, Lakefield or Laura. Roads may be closed in the park very shortly after rain to stop the road surface suffering damage.

==Camping==
There are many bush campgrounds throughout the park, and two camps with toilets and showers (Kalpowar Crossing Campground and Hanns Crossing Campground). There are other campsites without facilities across the park. Permits are all obtained via self-registration at the boards located throughout the park. *This has recently changed, no self-registration possible anymore (April 2013)*. Some campsites permit the use of generators that operate at 65 dB or lower. Due to the threat from crocodile attacks camping should not occur within 50 m of any body of water.

<text>The Lamington National Park is a national park in the McPherson Range on the Queensland/New South Wales border in Australia. From Southport on the Gold Coast the park is to the southwest and Brisbane is north. The Lamington National Park is known for its natural environment, rainforests, birdlife, ancient trees, waterfalls, walking tracks and mountain views. The park protects parts of the Eastern Australian temperate forests.

Protected areas to the east in Springbrook National Park and south along the Tweed Range in the Border Ranges National Park around Mount Warning in New South Wales conserve similar landscapes. The park is part of the Shield Volcano Group of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007. The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds. 

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Lamington National Park was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Natural attraction&quot;.

==Geography==

Most of the park is situated above sea level only from the Pacific&#x27;s ocean shores. The plateaus and cliffs in Lamington and Springbrook National Parks are the northern and north western remnants of the huge 23-million-year-old Tweed Volcano, centred around Mount Warning. Elevation in the south of the park is above in some parts. The land declines to under in the north. Some of the mountains in the park include Mount Hobwee, Mount Widgee, Mount Toolona, Mount Cominan, Mount Roberts and Mount Bithongabel, containing much of Australia&#x27;s few cloud forests. The Nerang River, Albert River and Coomera River all have their source in Lamington National Park. Eastern parts of the park feature high cliffs which rise above the Numinbah Valley. The park is within the City of Gold Coast and Scenic Rim Region local government areas. Southern Lamington and sections of O&#x27;Reilly, Binna Burra and Natural Bridge are protected with Lamington National Park.

==History==
For at least 6,000 years, Aboriginal people lived in and visited these mountains. The Wangerriburras and Nerangballum tribes claimed home to the plateau territory. Bushrangers Cave, which is close to Mount Hobwee and is long, was once an aboriginal camp. This site shows Aboriginal occupation going back 10,000 years.

Captain Patrick Logan and Allan Cunningham were the first European explorers in the area. The timber cutters soon followed, including the Lahey family who owned one of Queensland&#x27;s largest timber mills at the time. In 1863 a survey of the Queensland/New South Wales border was conducted. The task was carried out by Francis Edward Roberts and Isaiah Rowland, both surveyors, who had to define the border along the highest points in dense rainforest where there were very few clear lines of sight.

Robert Collins campaigned heavily for the protection of the area from logging from the 1890s. Collins entered state parliament and saw a bill passed that preserved state forests and national parks but he died before the McPherson Range was protected. Later it was another local, Romeo Lahey who recognised the value of preserving the forests. He campaigned to make it one of the first protected areas in Queensland. The O’Reilly family established a guesthouse near the park in 1926, now named O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Rainforest Retreat. Lahey wanted the O&#x27;Reillys to cease land clearing, for their land to be bought and for the O&#x27;Reilly family to leave the mountain. Lamington National Park was established in 1915. The park was named after Lord Lamington, Governor of Queensland from 1896 to 1902.

Founding members of the National Parks Association of Queensland built Binna Burra Lodge next to the park in the 1930s. In 1937, Bernard O&#x27;Reilly became a hero when he rescued the survivors from the Airlines of Australia Stinson Model A airliner &quot;City of Brisbane&quot;, which had crashed in the remote Lamington wilderness. In typical Australian bushman fashion he embarked on his rescue mission taking only onions and bread to eat. Only a small portion of the original wreck remains today, 10 km (6.2 miles) south of the O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s guesthouse.

In 2019, bushfires burnt holes in the rainforest canopy. Prolific weed growth occurs in these gaps. Weed eradication programs have been funded by the federal government. The Queensland Conservation Council has commissioned research showing significant funding is required to maintain the Gondwana Rainforests of Main Range. Water bombing planes were used to subdue fires in the national park.

==Natural heritage==


Rugged mountain scenery, waterfalls, caves, rainforest, wildflower heaths, tall open forests, creeks, varied wildlife and excellent bushwalking in Queensland are protected in Lamington National Park. Lamington is the core of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area along the adjoining Border Ranges National Park in New South Wales. The park is home to more than 200 rare and threatened plant and animal species.

David Attenborough visited and filmed the park while making the 1979 television series &quot;Life on Earth&quot; in which beech trees and bowerbirds were featured.

===Flora===
The national park protects one of the most diverse areas of vegetation in the country. The park&#x27;s lush rainforests include one of the largest upland subtropical rainforest remnants in the world and the most northern Antarctic beech cool temperate rainforests in Australia. The roots of the oldest Antarctic beech trees are over 5,000 years old. Around Mount Widgee numbers of Antarctic beech appear to be increasing. The park protects one of the country&#x27;s largest remaining forests of hoop pine (&quot;Araucaria cunninghamii&quot;) which are found on the drier slopes.

Below the white booyong and black booyong are commonly found. In higher elevations the yellow carabeen, red carabeen, pigeonberry ash, rosewood and soft corkwood trees predominate.

Many of Lamington&#x27;s plants are found nowhere else on earth, such as the Mt Merino eyebright and Everlasting Daisy which are subalpine relics from the last ice age. In 2006 it was realised that an old collection of the eastern underground orchid (&quot;Rhizanthella slateri&quot;) from Lamington was actually a separate species and has been described as the Lamington underground orchid (&quot;Rhizanthella omissa&quot;). This orchid, like the two other related species, has no chlorophyll and depends entirely upon a symbiotic fungus for survival. It is also one of only four flowering plants on Earth to complete its life cycle entirely underground. Sadly, one of Lamington&#x27;s more than 100 fern species is now presumed extinct; &quot;Antrophyum austroqueenslandicum&quot; was known from only a single plant which has since died and no other plants have been found. Lamington is also home to a large number of threatened plant species such as the ravine and blotched &quot;Sarchochilus&quot; orchids. Strangler figs are also found in Lamington.

===Fauna===
The area is one of the most important wildlife refuges in the region. Lamington is home to an incredible variety of wildlife including rare and threatened animals such as the Coxen&#x27;s fig parrot, eastern bristlebird, Albert&#x27;s lyrebird, Richmond birdwing butterfly. The blue Lamington crayfish is found only on the Lamington plateau in pools and streams above an elevation of . In damp conditions, they also move about the forest floor. The vulnerable large-eared pied bat is found in the park. Other rare species include the rainforest cool-skink, elf skink and numerous frog species including the Fleay&#x27;s barred frog, giant barred frog and the cascade treefrog. Red-necked pademelons can be seen near the edges of the rainforest and platypus may be spotted in the deeper rock pools. The regent bowerbird and the crimson rosella are often seen in Lamington.

The beetle &quot;Lamingtonium binnaberrense&quot;, the only species in the genus &quot;Lamingtonium&quot;, is found in Lamington National Park.

===Geology===
The Lamington National Park is located on the northern side of the Tweed volcano. This large shield volcano is over 100 kilometres in diameter, and extends from Tamborine Mountain in the north to Lismore in the south. The volcanic plug of Mount Warning marks the centre of the volcano. This volcano was active around 23 million years ago when this part of Australia was above a hotspot in the mantle. Both basaltic and rhyolitic lavas were erupted, and erosion of these lavas from rain and running water has formed the many spectacular landforms including cliffs, now observed in the park. Under these layers is a layer of tuff made from volcanic ash and fine rock which is up to thick in some places. The basalts of the Lamington Plateau originate from the Focal Point volcano. Near Binna Burra the maximum thickness of the basalt layer is estimated to be .

===Waterfalls===
The park is claimed to contain more than 500 waterfalls, including popular tourist falls Elabana Falls and Box Log (Tullerigumai) Falls located in the Green Mountains Section. Yarrabilgong Falls and Coomera Falls both flow into Coomera Gorge. Morans Falls is another cascade that is passed on the long Morans Falls Track. Nugurun Falls, Box Log Falls, Upper Ballanjui Falls, Lower Ballanjui Falls, Stairway Falls and Nagarigoon Falls are also located in the national park.

The claim of 500 waterfalls was confirmed by local explorer Dale Mullane in April 2022 when he reached his 500th documented waterfall in the park.

==Bushwalking==
The park is covered by more than of clearly marked walks that were constructed during the Great Depression and designed by Romeo Lahey. Lahey studied dairy cow movements on the surrounding hills, noticing that their paths never had a gradient of greater than 1:10. He laid out the parks tracks in a similar manner so that walkers would not be out of breath. Where steep terrain was unavoidable, steps were used instead of a steep track.

Some are short and others are steep and take up to seven hours to complete. The well maintained and signed Border Track, follows the border between New South Wales and Queensland along the top of the McPherson Range. This track links Binna Burra Lodge to the O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s guesthouse at Green Mountains, a distance of some , which can be completed one way in a day or in 7 to 8 hours.

A number of other well marked and varied walks connect with this Border Track creating a network which can be easily negotiated by relatively inexperienced bushwalkers. These include the Box Forest Circuit, which is or 4 hours return from O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s; Toolona Creek Circuit, which is or 6 hours return, and the Albert River Circuit, which is or 7 hours return to O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s—to name some of the best known. While the Border Track remains reasonably level for most of its length, many of the other tracks descend to lower elevations of or less and provide access to some of the diverse variety of flora, fauna and geography to be found in the park.

Another attraction is the Tree Top Walk, suspended above the ground. This walk provides the opportunity to safely walk through the canopy of the forest along a series of suspension bridges. Climbing a ladder up a strangler fig takes visitors to an observation deck above the ground.

For experienced walkers there are also numerous trails traversing the park. These trails do not have clear tracks; in many cases there are only occasional markers in the natural forest and it is inadvisable to use them without the company of an experienced bushwalker who knows the area. The walk to the Stinson wreck is long and steep in places. Map reading and good navigation skills are a necessity and National Park Rangers should be notified before commencing. Camping overnight is not permitted without a permit. There are a number of natural hazards such as leeches, snakes and stinging trees that bushwalkers should be aware of.

==Accommodation==
In addition to guest houses, there is also a campground available in the Green Mountains section of the park (adjacent to the O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s guest house), and a privately managed campground adjacent to the Binna Burra section of the park. Both camping areas have facilities. Limited bush camping is available between February and November.

<text>Boodjamulla National Park, formerly known as Lawn Hill National Park, is a national park in the Shire of Burke, Queensland, Australia. The Riversleigh World Heritage Area is a World Heritage Site within the park.

The park lies on the traditional land of the Waanyi (part of which was previously part of Injilarija land). In the 1870s European settlers moved into the area and started running cattle, with a number of smaller properties amalgamated to create Lawn Hill Station, one of Queensland&#x27;s largest cattle stations. An area of station land was given by the owner to the government as Crown land in 1984 (with a further grant in 1992), to be used for public benefit. The Waanyi people were granted native title in 2010.

The land lies across sandstone ranges, with creeks and rivers crossing it. The outstanding attraction is Lawn Hill Gorge. The park is home to a wide range of native wildlife, and is classified as an Important Bird Area.

 the park is jointly managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and the Waanyi people.

==History==
The Waanyi have lived in the gorge area for at least 17,000 years and know this place as Boodjamulla, or Rainbow Serpent country. Lawn Hill Gorge is sacred to the Waanyi people. Midden heaps, camp sites, grinding stones, and rock art evidence the importance of this place. Today, the Waanyi people help manage the park. Part of the land around Lawn Hill was occupied by the Injilarija people, until they became extinct around 1880 and the Waanyi took over their land.

The park has a rich pastoral history and until December 1984 was part of Lawn Hill Station, which was once one of Queensland&#x27;s largest cattle properties. The cattle station was formed from several leases originally granted in the 1870s, and for some time was run by the notoriously cruel Jack Watson and Frank Hann, who regularly hunted down and shot Aboriginal people living in the area, cutting the ears of their corpses and nailing them to the walls of the homestead. The Aboriginal outlaw Joe Flick shot dead a Native Police officer and wounded Frank Hann during a shootout at Lawn Hill in 1889. 

Sebastião Ferreira Maia, who owned that station from 1976, returned on the lease to the state in 1984, on the condition it be managed for the public&#x27;s benefit. In 1992, another was given to the crown to extend the park&#x27;s boundaries.

The Riversleigh and Musselbrook sections were amalgamated into the park in 1992.

The national park was gazetted on 8 August 1994 under the &quot;Nature Conservation Act 1992&quot; by regulation, Nature Conservation (Declaration of Nature Refuges) Amendment (No.1) 1994; then amended by regulation, Nature Conservation (Protected Areas) Amendment (No.5) 1999.and again by Forestry (State Forests) and Nature Conservation (Protected Areas) Amendment (No.1) 2003.

A native title claim was lodged by the Waanyi people in 1994, which was finally granted in 2010 that they received native title rights over the region.

The park was formerly known as Lawn Hill National Park.
On 7 June 2022 the new Boodjamulla National Park Management Plan was published, officially introducing joint management of the park between the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and the Waanyi people.

== Geography ==
The park is in the Gulf Country region of northwestern Queensland. The park is northwest of Mount Isa or northwest of Brisbane, in the Shire of Burke in Queensland.

The main attractions in the park are the sandstone ranges with deep gorges and a limestone plateau with significant fossil fields. Other attractions include crystal-clear green waters, lush vegetation and canoeing. Surrounding the park are numerous resources reserves, set aside for mineral exploration and mining.

==Description==

The Riversleigh Fossil Fields Section of the park is a World Heritage Site and contains many fossil remains. Animal bones dating back 25 million years are preserved in the sediments.

The park contains several permanent creeks, waterholes, gorges, and sandstone ranges. Boodjamulla&#x27;s ancient sandstones and limestones have been gradually stripped away over millions of years leaving behind rugged escarpments, gorges, and rock outcrops. There are four main habitats contained with the park: riverine, alluvial flats, rocky hills, and clay plains.

Lawn Hill Gorge, the primary attraction in the park, cuts through the sandstone plateau of the Constance Range, on the eastern extremity of the Barkly Tableland. The gorge has been carved out by Lawn Hill Creek, which flows all year and is fed by numerous freshwater springs from the limestone plateau to the west. The gorge is a rich oasis with cabbage palms and other tropical vegetation.

Also located in the park are the Gregory River and O&#x27;Shanassy Rivers which flow all year round. The park contains of walking tracks.
==Environment==

===Flora===
On the sandstone hills are spinifex, acacias, eucalypts and grevilleas. Growing on the river plains are western bloodwoods and mitchell grass. Paperbarks, river red gums, figs, ferns, pandanus and cabbage palms are found along the creek and river banks. A diverse range of aquatic plants such as waterlilies, ferns, mosses, sedges and bulrushes grow in the creeks.

===Fauna===
Freshwater crocodiles can be found in the gorge; however, they pose little threat because they prefer to stay away from humans. They may become aggressive if disturbed when mating or protecting their young.

The park is home to the most easterly distribution of the nocturnal rock ringtail possum. Other animal species found in the park include the rock-haunting ringtail possum, agile wallaby, olive python, catfish, wallaroo, dingo, and echidna. In the creeks are archerfish, the endangered red-bellied short-necked turtles, northern snapping turtles as well as numerous fish species.

Fishing in the national park is not permitted with the exception of Gregory River in the Riversleigh section. Lawn Hill and the surrounding regions are also inhabited by feral pigs which cause extensive damage to the land close by the creek systems.

====Birds====
The park is classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. It is home to more than 140 bird species, including the buff-sided robin, great bowerbird, red-collared lorikeet, crimson finch, zebra finch, kestrel, spinifex pigeon, barking owl, brolga, budgerigars, and the wedge-tailed eagle. It supports a large population of the Carpentarian grasswren and small numbers of the painted honeyeater. The rare purple-crowned fairy-wren is the park emblem.
==Management==

Since 7 June 2022, the park has been jointly managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and the Waanyi people. At this time, there were five or six Indigenous rangers, with the number expected to increase.
==Access==
The park is 100 km west of Gregory. From Mount Isa visitors travel along the Barkly Highway north. The easiest way to get to the park is via the Burke &amp; Wills Roadhouse. The road is unsealed and may be impassable after rain. The wet season is from October to March. Because the park is so remote it is advised that visitors bring excess fuel, food and water.

===Camping===
Camping is allowed in two areas; Lawn Hill Gorge and Miyumba bush camp near the Gregory River. The Lawn Hill Gorge site provides toilets and showers. This site allows only one vehicle per camp site and is not suitable for caravans or vehicles larger than 4 m in length. Permits are required and bookings are essential from Easter to October.

<doc id="103390" wikidata="Q21907659" url="?curid=103390" title="Lizard Island">
<text>Lizard Island, also known as Jiigurru or Dyiigurra, is an island on the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane. It is part of the Lizard Island Group that also includes Palfrey Island, and also part of the Lizard Island National Park. Lizard Island is within the locality of Lizard in the Cook Shire. The traditional owners of the Lizard Island group are the Aboriginal Australian clan known as the Dingaal (or Dingiil) people.

==History==
Archaeological excavations and studies have shown that human occupation of the island dates to 6510–5790 cal BP, which shows that Jiigurru was the earliest offshore island occupied on the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef.

Lizard Island was known as Dyiigurra to the Dingaal people, an Aboriginal clan who have occupied the island for thousands of years. Today this is usually rendered Jiigurru, and the local people are sometimes referred to as Dingiil. David Horton&#x27;s 1996 representation of Norman Tindale&#x27;s map shows the lands of the Guugu Yimithirr people extending from south of Hope Vale to an area which covers Lizard Island. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority states on their website that the traditional lands of the &quot;Guugu Yimidhirr Warra Nation&quot; extend from Lizard Island to the Hope Vale region. The website &quot;Dingaals Lizard Island&quot; states that the island has been in the custodianship of the Dingaal people for thousands of years. According to the Cairns Institute and Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, the Dingaal people are the traditional owners of the Lizard Island group. the senior elder of the Dingaals is Gordon Charlie. The Dingaal believed that the Lizard group of islands had been created in the Dreamtime. They saw it as a stingray, with Lizard Island being the body and the other islands in the group forming the tail. The island has along been regarded as a sacred place, used for ceremonies and trading.

Pottery found on the island has been dated at more than 1,800 years old, showing that pots were most likely made by Aboriginal people using locally-sourced materials. The 2024 study showed that the people who lived there were involved in the ancient maritime networks in the vicinity, including the possession of sophisticated skills in building ocean-going vessels as well as navigation. (See below).

The name Lizard Island was given to it by Captain Cook when he passed it on 12 August 1770. He commented, &quot;The only land animals we saw here were lizards, and these seem&#x27;d to be pretty plenty, which occasioned my naming the Island Lizard Island.&quot; Cook climbed the peak on Lizard Island to chart a course out to sea through the maze of reefs which confronted him and the island&#x27;s summit has since been called &#x27;Cook&#x27;s Look&#x27;.

By the 1840s, the island was being used by sea cucumber (trepang, or &quot;bêche-de-mer&quot;) fishermen who found that the waters contained substantial quantities of the creature which was a popular delicacy in Asia. Scottish naturalist John McGillivray visited the island in the &quot;Julia Percy&quot; in 1861, and wrote that there had been &quot;bêche-de-mer&quot; vessels operating there from Sydney, Singapore, and Hong Kong for 15 years prior.

In 1879, Captain Robert Watson with his wife Mary Watson, two servants and baby son, modified an abandoned cottage left on the island by the crew of the &quot;Julia Percy&quot;. The ruins are still visible. Captain Watson was a sea cucumber fisherman, and his Mary Watson was only 21 when she arrived at Lizard Island. During one of the captain&#x27;s absences in September 1880, Mary, her son Ferrier, and two Chinese servants, Ah Sam and Ah Leung, were left on the island. A group of Guugu Yimmidir or Dingaal people travelled on a regular seasonal trip by canoe, or went to investigate smoke at a sacred site on the island The Watsons&#x27; home was close to the only source of fresh water, and Mary may have unknowingly trespassed on a ceremonial ground reserved for adult men. The visiting men attacked, killing Ah Leung and wounding Ah Sam. After the attack, accompanied by her child and Ah Sam, Mary attempted to flee to the mainland in an iron boiling tank used for boiling sea cucumber, a large rectangular tub. The vessel floated away from the coast and all three died of thirst nine days later on the waterless No 5 Howick Island. Their bodies were found three months later along with Mary Watson&#x27;s diary. The boiling tank can be seen in the Queensland Museum, and the State Library of Queensland holds two diaries by Mrs Watson. One is about her last nine months on Lizard Island, and the other comprises notes documenting her last days.

In retaliation to the attack, a punitive expedition was mounted against Aboriginal peoples, and many innocent Aboriginal people were massacred in retribution, a part which has often been left out of the story. This devastated Aboriginal communities and their traditional economies in the region, which had already been affected by expanding agriculture and the discovery of gold, leading to the establishment of Cooktown in 1873. In 1886 the first Aboriginal mission was established at Elim Aboriginal Mission by German Lutherans. The mission, along with Cape Bedford Mission, was the foundation of the present Hope Vale settlement, where many Dingaal people continue to reside.

In 1939, all of the islands in the group were declared a national park.

The Lizard Island Research Station was established by the Australian Museum in 1973, the waters surrounding the island were declared a marine park in 1974, and Lizard Island Resort opened in 1975.

In 2014, the resort was damaged by Cyclone Ita, and had to close for repairs.

==Geology and geography==

Lizard Island is located in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef, directly off the mainland, north of Cooktown and Cape Flattery. It is a granite island about in size, with three smaller islands nearby (Palfrey, South and Bird). Together these islands form the Lizard Island Group, and their well-developed fringing reef encircles the deep Blue Lagoon. The highest point is Cook&#x27;s Look, above sea level.

It is a continental island, once around inland and separated after the post-Pleistocene flooding, around 7000 years ago. It was created mostly by an orogenic pluton of porphyritic biotite and muscovite, formed during the Permian age around 300 million years ago.

There are many beaches on the island, including Mangrove Beach, Freshwater Beach (also known as One Tree Coconut Beach), Watson&#x27;s Beach, and Casuarina Beach.

== Archaeology ==
The oldest occupation layers on the island date to 6510–5790 cal BP, which shows that Jiigurru was the earliest offshore island occupied on the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. There are numerous shell middens, stone arrangements, and art sites on the island, showing signs of occupation of the island for thousands of years. In the 1990s, two Aboriginal rock art sites were observed in rockshelters formed by large granite boulders, in which red ochre was used.

===Site 17===
Site 17 is an archaeological site located on a hill above Freshwater Beach (also known as One Tree Coconut Beach) of Lizard Island, which was found to contain granite-derived, quartz sand temper. The midden is quite large, covering a total area of . Site 17 was first observed by Jim Specht in 1978-9, then excavated by Robynne Mills in 1992. The site was further excavated by a team including Specht in 2009, who created a X x trench, and identified six stratigraphic layers. It was observed through radiocarbon dating that the basal layer (6) produced a range of 3358-2929 cal BP on charcoal found at the depth. In October 2009 Lentfer, Specht, and a representative of the Dingaal people, Johnathan Charlie, began excavating a new trench east of Mills trench. This new trench was x x , and showed six layers of stratigraphy similar to Mills trench. There were recovered pieces of quartz, granite, and pumice discovered from the basal levels of layer number 6, which using radiocarbon dating were dated to be from 3815-3571 cal BP to 3206-2959 cal BP.

===Mangrove Beach===
In 2006, New Zealand archaeologist Matthew Felgate found pottery in an intertidal zone by chance when he was on holiday on the island, on Mangrove Beach. This was the first pottery found, and was reported in a 2010 study by Felgate; however, it could not be reliably dated at that time. Later, Sean Ulm, distinguished professor at James Cook University, and Ian J. McNiven, professor at Monash University, both of whom were operating under the auspices of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CABAH), co-led a team including Kenneth McLean, chair of Walmbaar Aboriginal Corporation, and other members of the Dingaal and Ngurrumungu communities, that excavated several more pieces of pottery from the site in 2009, 2010, and 2012. Initial analysis showed local materials were used in the manufacture. However, the age of the pottery could not be established.

The Ulm team revisited Jiigurru and excavated a shell midden not far from the pottery site, discovering that the site had been settled at least 4,000 years previously, but no pottery was found. The same team started working with the Indigenous owners and excavated a different midden and found a lot of pottery. Digging deeper, cultural material was found nearly metres below ground level, which was radiocarbon-dated to around 6,500 years ago; the earliest evidence of use of an island on the northern Great Barrier Reef. The resulting study, published in April 2024 and involving many scientists, working with traditional owners, determined that sherds found on the island were the oldest securely dated ceramics found in Australia. The data showed that local raw materials were used and that the pottery was made on the island, which showed that the people who lived there were involved in the ancient maritime networks in the vicinity, including the possession of sophisticated canoe travel technology and skills in navigating on the ocean, which enabled them to connect with other peoples across the Coral Sea. The dating showed that it was created between 2950–2545 cal BP and 1970–1815 cal BP, which overlaps with the late Lapita and post-Lapita traditions of southern Papua New Guinea. Co-author Quan Hua of ANSTO is an expert in radiocarbon dating. The significance of the study lies in the fact that it is the first pottery in Australia to have been found and reliably dated, and that it shows that the people of Australia were not geographically isolated, but involved with other seafaring peoples. There is conclusive evidence that the pottery is not of Lapita origin, and it is also proof of continuous seasonal occupation of the island by Aboriginal people. It is not known by newer sherds were not found on that site, and further research is necessary. There has been a paucity of research done on the eastern side of Cape York Peninsula.

==Governance==
Lizard Island is within the locality of Lizard in the Cook Shire.

Lizard Island National Park is administered by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (Parks and Forests).

The island is also part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, administered jointly by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency. Permits are required for all manipulative research in the Lizard Island Group and the waters surrounding it.

==Heritage listings==
Lizard Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including Mrs Watson&#x27;s Cottage

== Flora and fauna==
===Plant species===
As the sea level rose in the early Holocene, resulting in the isolation of Lizard Island, mangrove forest gradually became established in place of the near-coastal palms and grasses. There are a number of distinct plant communities, mainly &quot;Themeda australis&quot; and &quot;Arundinella nepalensis&quot; (a low grass), and some small patches of rainforest and semi-deciduous notophyll (dry rainforest). There is some woodland consisting of mainly &quot;Acacia crassicarpa&quot; and some &quot;Eucalyptus tessellaris&quot;, along with shrubs such as &quot;Thryptomene oligandra&quot; and swamplands of pandanus. Along the coastal dune there is strand vegetation.

===Animals===
The waters around the island contain a number of coral reefs. Climate change is causing the reefs to suffer coral bleaching, in the summer of early 2024 over 97% of some reefs around the island died.

==== Reptiles ====
 there were 11 species of lizards on the island. The most commonly found lizard is the yellow-spotted monitor (&quot;Varanus panoptes).&quot; Skinks and geckos are among some of the other reptiles roaming Lizard Island. The lowlands bar-lipped skink (&quot;Eremiascincus pardalis&quot;) and the sandy rainbow-skink (&quot;Carlia dogare&quot;) are endemic species of Queensland found on this island. The Chevert gecko (Nactus cheverti) is the only gecko on the island that&#x27;s only endemic to Queensland. Pythons and tree snakes are common while the most dangerous snake on the island, the brown-headed snake (&quot;Furina tristis&quot;), is rarely seen. Green marine turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) and loggerhead marine turtles (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;) can be seen nesting on the island in the summer and are often spotted in the shallow water.

==== Birds ====
There are over 40 species of birds that reside on or visit Lizard Island. Only about 20 species nest on the island, including terns. The island is home to many land and sea birds including the bar-shouldered dove (&quot;Geopelia humeralis)&quot;, pheasant coucal (&quot;Centropus phasianinus),&quot; yellow-bellied sunbird (&quot;Nectarinia jugularis),&quot; white-bellied sea-eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucogaster&quot;), and osprey (&quot;Pandion cristatus&quot;). Seasonal birds such as white-tailed tropicbird (&quot;Phaethon lepturus)&quot; and dollarbird &quot;(Eurystomus orientalis)&quot; also appear on the island.

==== Mammals ====
Lizard Island is home to a few bat species, but the most common is the Black flying-foxes (&quot;Pteropus alecto&quot;). They typically roam around the island and congregate in the mangroves. Black flying-foxes will fly to the mainland when flowering is poor. Eastern Dusky Leaf-nosed Bat (&quot;Hipposideros ater&quot;) have also been spotted on the island.

Until 2009, Lizard Island had no native rodents recorded. In October 2009, water rats (&quot;Hydromys chrysogaster&quot;) were spotted on the island and steadily increased in population until 2012. In 2010, Cape York mosaic-tailed rat (&quot;Melomys capensis)&quot; were spotted in South Island, marked as the first native rodent to the island chain.

==Current settlement and use==
Aside from the national park, Lizard Island also contains a number of other facilities:

===Lizard Island Research Station===

Situated on Lizard Island&#x27;s most westerly point, the Lizard Island Research Station (LIRS) was established in 1973 by ichthyologist and marine biologist Frank Talbot, then director of the Australian Museum. It continues to be operated by the museum, providing research and education facilities for those interested in studying coral reefs. LIRS is part of the Australian Museum Research Institute (AMRI), headed by Kris Helgen.

, Anne Hoggett and Lyle Vail are co-directors of LIRS.

As a result of research conducted at the station, about 1,000 scientific publications had been produced by Australian and international researchers .

===Lizard Island Resort===
On the island&#x27;s north western side is an ultra luxury resort owned by Hong Kong listed property company Sea Holdings and operated by Voyages Hotels &amp; Resorts until November 2009, later operated by Delaware North.

<text>Lochern is a national park in Longreach, Central West Queensland, Australia, 1,047 km west of Brisbane. Eastern parts of the national park are interspersed with numerous channels of the Thomson River. The park is sprawled over an area of 24,300 hectares. This area forms important habitats for numerous species. Several lagoons and waterholes within the park provide important refuges for birds and other wildlife.

==History==
The diverse climate of Lochern was a boon for the aboriginal people, who learned to utilize the dry and wet spells. They adapted to the seasonal transformation of land, reaping its bounties. Rainwater harvesting with the help of dams was done by pastoralists in the area.

==Camping==
Camping facilities are available at the park. The park&#x27;s camping site, which is located some five kilometres from the park&#x27;s eastern limit, is surrounded by mulga and gidgee woodlands. The camping area is accessible on vehicles, although the dirt road can be sometimes hard to tackle for normal vehicles. Hence, four-wheel drive is a better option. The park is notorious for abrupt weather changes. Minor showers can often lead to floods, irrespective of the time of year.

<text>Girringun National Park is a national park in Queensland, Australia, approximately southwest of Ingham, north of Townsville and northwest of Brisbane. The park is one of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area series of national parks, and is a gazetted World Heritage Site.

==History==
The park was originally named the Lumholtz National Park, after scientist Carl Sofus Lumholtz, when it was created in 1994. The Blencoe Falls Section was gazetted as part of Lumholtz National Park in 2000. The name was subsequently changed to Girringun in 2003. On National Parks Day 2010 (28 March) the Government of Queensland announced the addition of to the park.

==Environment==

This large national park consists mainly of wet sclerophyll forests, but small pockets of rainforest also exist along the eastern slopes and hilltops.
The Seaview, George and Cardwell ranges dominate the landscape, which is strewn with granite debris from a volcanic eruption 100,000 years ago. Perhaps the most well known geological feature in this park is the Wallaman Falls. At it is the largest single-drop falls in Australia. The park forms part of the Wooroonooran Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of a range of bird species endemic to Queensland&#x27;s Wet Tropics.

==Access and infrastructure==
Vehicle access into the forest include the Dalrymple Gap Track, or the Wallaman Falls track. However, for most of the park there is only very rudimentary or absent vehicle access. Most of the park is accessible for hikers, but due to its remoteness and rugged terrain only experienced bushwalkers should undertake extensive hikes.

<doc id="103394" wikidata="Q1628962" url="?curid=103394" title="Main Range National Park">
<text>The Main Range is a mountain range and national park in Queensland, Australia, located predominantly in Tregony, Southern Downs Region, southwest of Brisbane. It is part of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia (formerly known as the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves). It protects the western part of a semicircle of mountains in South East Queensland known as the Scenic Rim. This includes the largest area of rainforest in South East Queensland. The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.

==Description==

The park extends from Kangaroo Mountain, near Frazerview, south to Wilsons Peak on the New South Wales border and includes Mount Superbus (1,375 m), South East Queensland’s highest peak.

Bare Rock, Mount Cordeaux, Mount Mitchell, Spicers Peak, Mount Huntley, Mount Asplenium, Mount Steamer, The Steamer Range, Lizard Point, Mount Roberts, Mount Mistake and Mount Superbus all lie within the Main Range National Park. In total, there are more than 40 peaks higher than 1,000 m.

There are walking tracks, camping areas and picnic facilities at a number of places such as Spicers Gap, Cunninghams Gap and Queen Mary Falls.

===Geology===
The Main Range Volcanics are thought to be remains of a widespread lava field that probably had multiple simultaneous eruptive centres.

The Main Range shield volcano erupted between 25 and 22 million years ago in the Tertiary period. Rather than forming a central peak, the volcano erupted through numerous basalt dykes that created horizontal lava flows; these are mainly basalt but also sometimes consist of trachyte. These flows now form the bulk of the Main Range, Little Liverpool Range and Mistake Range, and once covered a much wider area that includes both the Lockyer Valley and Fassifern Valley.

===Flora and fauna===

The steeper slopes have avoided any land clearing, acting as a refuge for wildlife in the region. The most predominant vegetation types on the range is sub-tropical rainforest and dry sclerophyll forest. The park&#x27;s forests and montane heath provide habitat for many animals, including the eastern bristlebird, Coxen&#x27;s fig parrot, and the black-breasted buttonquail, all of which are threatened by extinction. The vulnerable and rare red goshawk may also be seen.

The giant barred frog, Fleay&#x27;s barred frog, spotted-tailed quoll and the Hastings River mouse are listed as endangered species, once more commonly found in the Goomburra section of the park.

==History==
Spicers Gap is believed to be a traditional pathway for Indigenous Australians travelling between the inland and the coast.

In 1828, Allan Cunningham &#x27;officially&#x27; discovered the route through the mountains now called Cunninghams Gap; however, it can be easily seen from Brisbane. Stockman Henry Alphen discovered Spicers Gap in 1847. The Spicers Gap Road, used to carry supplies to and from the Darling Downs, is the best remaining example of sophisticated 19th-century engineering in Queensland.

In 1840, George Elphinstone Dalrymple settled in the Goomburra Valley. Dalrymple Creek was named after this early settler. By 1847, a new road through Spicers Gap was opening areas for settlers. In 1909, the area surrounding Cunninghams Gap was declared a national park. In 1994, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee extended the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves of Australia to include Goomburra Forest Reserve within Main Range National Park. In 2007, the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia was added to the Australian National Heritage List.

==Heritage listings==

<text>Mariala National Park is a national park in South West Queensland, Australia, 810 km west of Brisbane. Mariala lies within the Mulga Lands bioregion and the Shire of Quilpie local government area. It is located with the water catchment areas of the Bulloo, Paroo and Warrego rivers. Mariala covers .

The park was part of the Ambathala pastoral holding which operated from 1875 until the early 1980s. In 1982, the area became a scientific reserve, making it the first protected area to preserve part of Queensland&#x27;s extensive Mulga Lands. A decade later, it was declared a national park.

A total of six rare or threatened species have been identified in the national park. These include Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo and the rare square-tailed kite.

<doc id="103399" wikidata="Q7438551" url="?curid=103399" title="Scouting in Indiana">
<text>Scouting in Indiana has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910-1950)==
Indianapolis is home to Troop 9, founded by &quot;Chief&quot; Francis Oliver Belzer in 1910, one of the first Scout troops in America.

Belzer founded Firecrafter at Camp Chank-Tun-Un-Gi (now called Camp Belzer) in the summer of 1920. Belzer also served as the first Scout Executive for the Indianapolis Council, later known as the Central Indiana Council.

The first National Order of the Arrow Conference was held at Indiana University in 1948.

==Recent history (1950-2010)==
In 1950, 1956, 1961, 1965, 1969, 1990, 2002, 2009 and 2018, the National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) was held at Indiana University in Bloomington, the most frequent venue for the event. In 1994, NOAC was held at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.

==Boy Scouts of America in Indiana today==

There are nine Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils in Indiana. All of Indiana lies within Central Region, except for Clark, Scott, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford, and Washington counties, as part of Southern Region.

===Anthony Wayne Area Council===
Based in Fort Wayne, Indiana and covering 11 counties in Northeast Indiana — Adams, Wells, Jay, Huntington, Allen, DeKalb, LaGrange, Noble, Steuben, Whitley, Kosciusko.

*Lincolnway District (Whitley and Kosciusko Counties)
*Pokagon District (DeKalb, LaGrange, Noble, Steuben)
*Three Rivers District (Learning for Life)
*Summit District (within 469)
*Wabash Valley District (Adams, Huntington, Jay, Wells)

Features Anthony Wayne Scout Reservation with Camp Chief Little Turtle

====Anthony Wayne Scout Reservation====
The Anthony Wayne Scout Reservation is a Scouts BSA camp located near Ashley, Indiana, United States.

The reservation has three key areas: Camp Chief Little Turtle (CCLT), Camp Foellinger, and Camp Wilderness.
*Camp Chief Little Turtle is the main camp. It has many activity centers, such as a waterfront, handicraft, outdoor skills, Project C.O.P.E., and other typical features of a Scouts BSA camp.
*Camp Foellinger is used mainly for special events, such as Cub Scout camp, National Youth Leadership Training, and Order of the Arrow events.
*Camp Wilderness contains the Jack Zeiger Ropes Course — used for C.O.P.E. and rock climbing — and Orion, an area used for camping and wilderness survival training.

===Buffalo Trace Council===
The Buffalo Trace Council is based in Evansville, Indiana that serves southwestern Indiana and southeastern Illinois. Its affiliated Order of the Arrow lodge is Kiondaga Lodge.

====Camps====
The Buffalo Trace Council has operated four camps throughout its existence, three of which are still in existence. Camp Arthur, located near Vincennes, opened in 1945 and was removed from the list of BSA-approved camping facilities for a time in the mid-1990s. Camp Carnes, located between Jasper and Dubois, has since changed ownership to the City of Jasper and is run as a park. Old Ben Scout Reservation (OBSR), located in Pike County, Indiana opened in 1985 on the site of an abandoned strip mine operated by the Old Ben Coal Company and was the council&#x27;s current primary summer camp location, until a lack of funding forced the council to cease having summer camps there. Camp Pohoka was the previous summer camp location, but was shut down when OBSR was opened.

===Pathway to Adventure Council===

Pathway to Adventure Council is based in Chicago, Illinois and covers much of its metro area, including the north-west corner of Indiana.

===Crossroads of America Council===

Headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Crossroads of America Council (BSA Council #160) serves Scouts and Scouters in Central Indiana. It was initially formed when Central Indiana Council, Delaware County Council, Kikthawenund Council, and Whitewater Valley Council merged in 1972. 

===Hoosier Trails Council===

The Hoosier Trails Council, BSA serves in 18 counties in south-central Indiana, and to more than 6,000 youth each year.

====History====
The Hoosier Trails Council is the result of several council mergers.

In 1921, the Bartholomew County Council (#150) was founded. During the late 1920s, it merged into the Hoosier Hills Area Council (#150), founded in 1928.

In 1928 the Lost River Area Council was founded. In 1931 it was absorbed into the White River Area Council (#145), founded in 1927.

In 1973, White River and Hoosier Hills merged to form the Hoosier Trails Council (#145).

====Organization====
*Muscatatuck District (Hoosier Hills District and Lenni Lenape District merged in 2019) serving Dearborn, Jefferson, Ohio, Ripley, Switzerland, Bartholomew, Jackson, Decatur, &amp; Jennings Counties

*White River Trails District (Lincoln Trails District and Southern Trails District merged in 1990) serving Lawrence, Orange, Martin, Daviess, &amp; Greene Counties

====Camps====
Resident summer camp is held at Maumee Scout Reservation, located on Lake Tarzian in the Hoosier National Forest. Maumee first opened in 1972 for White River Council as a replacement for its previous camp, Camp Wapehani in Bloomington, Indiana which had been divided by a recent re-alignment of State Road 37. The property is near in Norman, Indiana. Lake Tarzian is named after Sarkes Tarzian who led the capital campaign to build the camp.

Until 2023, the council also possessed Camp Louis Ernst in Dupont. Louis Ernst was founded in 1928 and operated by Hoosier Hills Council until its merger with White River Council to form Hoosier Trails Council in 1973. After this, Louis operated as a summer camp until 1983 when it was reduced to primitive camping. The camp was officially transferred to a group known as the Friends of Camp Louis Ernst in 2023.

====Order of the Arrow====
Nischa Chuppecat Lodge (#212) is Hoosier Trails&#x27; Order of the Arrow Lodge. It was founded in 1973 as the merger of Wazi Yata (#290) and So-Aka-Gha-Gwa (#212) lodges.

Both So-Aka-Gha-Gwa and Wazi Yata can trace back their heritage to other organizations separate from the Order of the Arrow.

The predecessor to So-Aka-Gha-Gwa, the Order of The Golden Arrow, was founded at Cataract Falls in the late 1930s and became So-Aka-Gha-Gwa Lodge in 1941.

The predecessor to Wazi Yata, the Order of the Wazi Yata, was founded at Camp Louis Ernst in 1934 and became Wazi Yata Lodge in 1945.

Nischa Chuppecat and So-Aka-Gha-Gwa have collectively hosted the National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) at Indiana University eleven times as of the summer of 2018, the most of any lodge in the nation.

===Lincoln Heritage Council===
The George Rogers Clark Council was formed by Scouts of Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford, Scott, and Washington counties in 1927, and merged with Old Kentucky Home Council in 1993 to form the Lincoln Heritage Council, which serves Scouts in Kentucky and Indiana. The Council absorbed the Shawnee Trails Council of western Kentucky (and part of southern Illinois and northwestern Tennessee) in April 2012 to serve scouts in Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, and Tennessee.

====John Work House and Mill Site|Tunnel Mill Scout Reservation====

Tunnel Mill Scout Reservation is a Scouts BSA camp just outside Charlestown, Indiana, owned by the Lincoln Heritage Council. In 1917 local Troop 3 decided to use the property as a summer camp, as it would for three summers. The George Rogers Clark Council shortly after 1927 bought Tunnel Mill from the Murphy family, who had bought the property the previous year but lost interest after a mill fire. In 1933 the three-sided wooden Pioneer Village cabins were built. In 1942 the Scoutmaster&#x27;s Cabin and Evergreen cabins were completed. In 1950 the McDonald Bridge was completed across Fourteen Mile Creek. The camp saw its greatest use in the 1950s and 1960s, with 564 Scouts, the highest attendance ever, in 1960. In 1969 the swimming pool was built, to replace the creek, now-unsafe for swimming. By the 1980s the lessening attendance made the future of the camp uncertain. When the George Rogers Clark Council, which owned the property, merged with Old Kentucky Home Council, one of the conditions was that Tunnel Mill would not be closed. Since 1993 the camp has been used primarily by Cub Scouts and for winter camping. The property includes a cabin village, a swimming pool, and a dining hall built in 2000. The new dining hall replaced the one from the 1980s that once served as a steakhouse in Jeffersonville.

On November 6, 1996, Andy Campbell, a ranger serving as Tunnel Mill&#x27;s caretaker, was shot to death by Roger Caldwell, &quot;a diagnosed, paranoid schizophrenic&quot; who trespassed onto the property while drunk. This was the first such incident in the history of Scouting. Campbell was able to drag himself to call 911. After police arrived on the scene to get information about the drunk from Campbell, they found Caldwell wandering on Indiana Highway 62. Caldwell was sentenced to 70 years in prison, with parole possible after 31 years.

=== Prairielands Council ===

Prairielands Council, previously the short-lived &quot;Illiana Council&quot;, has its headquarters in Champaign, Illinois, and also serves Scouts in Indiana.

=== Sagamore Council ===
The Sagamore Council was founded in 1973 by a merger of the Three Rivers Council (Headquarters in Logansport, IN), Mesingomesia Council (Headquarters in Marion, IN) and the Harrison Trails Council (Headquarters in Lafayette, IN). The council offices were eventually consolidated to a single office in Kokomo, Indiana. The council maintains two camps: Camp Cary, (near Lafayette, IN) used as a Cub Scout day camp and Camp Buffalo, (near Buffalo, IN - north and east of Indiana Beach) used as a Scouts BSA summer camp. The camp properties of Green Hills and Crossland were sold. Camp Green Hills was south and west of Lafayette, IN. Mesingomesia Council&#x27;s Crossland Scout Reservation near Columbia City, Indiana was sold to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources in 1992 and is now called the Deniston Resource Area (named after a fallen DNR Conservation Officer). The camp was located on Robinson Lake, one of the last natural lakes in Indiana with almost no development. This was due in large part to the camp which encompassed almost three-fourths of the shoreline.

A few things make Sagamore Council unique:

# Purdue University, in West Lafaytte, IN, hosted the 1994 National Order of the Arrow Conference.
# Weaver Popcorn (which markets Trail&#x27;s End Popcorn) is produced in Van Buren, Indiana.
# Ramsey Popcorn (which markets Campmasters Popcorn) is produced in Ramsey, Indiana.
# George O. Crossland was a Scout Executive who served the prior Mesingomesia Council. He was known for more notable Scouting functions including creating an honorary that rivaled the Order of the Arrow—TI-PI-SA, the Order of the Red Lodge. Crossland Scout Reservation was named after him.

====Districts====
* North Star District, serving Cass, Fulton, Jasper, Newton, Pulaski &amp; White counties
* Peshewa District, serving Blackford, Grant, Howard, Miami and Wabash counties 
* Wabash Valley District, serving Benton, Carroll, Tippecanoe, Warren &amp; Northern Fountain counties

====Camps====
The Sagamore Council currently operates two camps:

* Camp Buffalo - Buffalo, Indiana

==Girl Scouting in Indiana==

There are 5 Girl Scout councils that serve Indiana.

On August 26, 2006, Girl Scouts of the USA&#x27;s (GSUSA) national board of directors voted to endorse a plan to realign 312 councils into 109 high-capacity, community-based councils. The new structure will make the most effective use of resources to better serve the local community and create more opportunities in Girl Scouting for even more girls. Girl Scouts of Central Indiana was the first Girl Scout council in the nation to complete the merger process.

===Girl Scouts of Central Indiana===

Formed by the merger of Girl Scouts of Hoosier Capital Council, Covered Bridge Girl Scout Council, Girl Scouts of Treaty Line Council, Girl Scouts of Sycamore Council, and Girl Scouts of Wapephani Council, and the addition of Howard and Carroll Counties from Girl Scouts of Tribal Trails Council.

<text>Michaelmas and Upolu Cays is a national park in Queensland, Australia, north-northwest of Brisbane and east of Cairns. It comprises two small cays on Michaelmas Reef, which forms the north-eastern section of the Arlington reef complex, within the Great Barrier Reef.

==Flora and fauna==
===Plants===
The vegetation on Michaelmas Cay is characteristic of cays found on the outer barrier reef. Low-growing, it consists of beach spinifex, stalky grass, goatsfoot, bulls-head vine, sea purslane and tar vine. Nutrients fertilising the vegetation come from seabird droppings and carcasses. The smaller Upolu Cay is un-vegetated.

===Animals===
Michaelmas Cay is important as a breeding site for several species of terns. It has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports over 1% of the world populations of greater and lesser crested terns. Sooty terns and common noddies also breed there. Other terns that have nested on the cay in the past include roseate and black-naped terns.

Green turtles sometimes nest on the cays. The surrounding reefs have a rich marine fauna, including giant clams.

<text>Minerva Hills is a national park in Central Queensland, Australia, 626 km northwest of Brisbane. Lookouts within the national park overlook the town of Springsure. The park features a rugged landscape with volcanic peaks, sheltered gorges, sheer cliffs, open woodlands and dry rainforest.

The park lies within the water catchment areas of the Comet and Nogoa rivers and within the Brigalow Belt bioregion.

There are four lookouts and a picnic area for visitors. Camping is not allowed in the park.

== Geology ==
The Minerva Hills National Park sits on the Oligocene Minerva Hills Volcanics. These volcanics have been broadly divided into a basal series of mafic lavas (some 70 m thick) overlain by a series of intercalated mafic volcanics, felsic volcanics ranging from trachyte to rhyolite and trachytic pyroclastics.  The pyroclastics are related to plugs and domes. The lower sequence has been dated at approximately 33 -34 Ma (million years) and the upper sequence 28.5–27.5 Ma.

The Minerva Hills Volcanics is a remnant of Oligocene hot spot volcanism known as the Cosgrove Hot Spot. This hot spot forms the longest continental hot spot track on earth.

<text>Moogerah Peaks is a National Park in the Fassifern Valley of South East Queensland, Australia, located approximately 70 km south west of the state capital Brisbane. The 676-hectare park consists of four separate protected areas which surround volcanic peaks and rocky cliffs near Moogerah Dam.

==Environment==
Because the peaks are relatively inaccessible the natural vegetation of the area has remained intact. The vegetation is mostly open eucalypt forest with montane heath on exposed rock faces. In sheltered areas there are some patches of rainforest. The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.

==Moogerah Peaks==

The Moogerah Peaks are a small set of mountains with a volcanic origin. The summits of Mount French, Mount Edwards, Mount Moon and Mount Greville are each contained within four separate sections of the park.

On Mount French the cliffs at Frog Buttress are one of the state&#x27;s most popular areas for rockclimbers. The National Park surrounds Lake Moogerah, and access to the Mount Edwards portion of the park can be had across the dam wall and spillway of the lake.

Palm Gorge is situated on Mount Greville. This narrow gorge contains a nearly pure stand of Piccabeen Palms. To the west and south of this park lies the Main Range National Park preserving part of the Scenic Rim. The flora of the peaks is diverse including rainforests, sclerophyll woodlands and montane heath in the rocky exposed areas. Endemic flora species occur on the peaks that can be found nowhere else on earth, such as the Moogerah Peaks Leionema and Mount Greville Reed Grass.

<text> (; Avestan: ) is a divine plant in Zoroastrianism and in later Persian culture and mythology. has its origins in Indo-Iranian religion and is the cognate of Vedic .

==Etymology==
Both Avestan and Sanskrit derived from proto-Indo-Iranian *. The root of the word , , and of , , suggests &#x27;press&#x27; or &#x27;pound&#x27;.

In Old Persian cuneiform it was known as , as in the DNa inscription (c. 490 BC) which makes reference to &quot;&quot;haoma&quot;-drinking Scythians&quot; ().

The Middle Persian form of the name is , which continues to be the name in Modern Persian and other living Iranian languages ().

==As a plant==
===In the Avesta===
The physical attributes, as described in the texts of the Avesta, include:
* the plant has stems, roots and branches ( 10.5).
* it has a plant ( 9.16). The term is only used in conjunction with a description of , and does not have an established translation. It refers to &#x27;twigs&#x27; according to Dieter Taillieu, &#x27;stalk&#x27; according to Robert Wasson, &#x27;fibre&#x27; or &#x27;flesh&#x27; according to Ilya Gershevitch, &#x27;sprouts&#x27; according to Lawrence Heyworth Mills.
* it is tall ( 10.21, 19.19)
* it is fragrant ( 10.4)
* it is golden-green (standard appellation, 9.16 et al.)
* it can be pressed ( 9.1, 9.2)
* it grows on the mountains, &#x27;swiftly spreading&#x27;, &#x27;apart on many paths&#x27; ( 9.26, 10.3-4 et al.) &#x27;to the gorges and abysses&#x27; ( 10–11) and &#x27;on the ranges&#x27; ( 10.12)

The indirect attributes (i.e., as effects of its consumption) include:
* it furthers healing ( 9.16-17, 9.19, 10.8, 10.9)
* it furthers sexual arousal ( 9.13-15, 9.22)
* it is physically strengthening ( 9.17, 9.22, 9.27)
* it stimulates alertness and awareness ( 9.17, 9.22, 10.13)
* the mildly intoxicating extract can be consumed without negative side effects ( 10.8).
* it is nourishing ( 9.4, 10.20) and &#x27;most nutritious for the soul&#x27; ( 9.16).

===In present-day Zoroastrianism===
Many of the physical attributes as described in the texts of the Avesta match the plant used in present-day Zoroastrian practice. In present-day preparation of &quot;parahaoma&quot; (for details, see Ab-Zohr),
* the twigs are repeatedly pounded in the presence of a little water, which suggests ancient was also water-soluble.
* the twigs have to be imported by Indian-Zoroastrians, who believe that they are, for climatic reasons, not obtainable on the Indian subcontinent.
* very small quantities are produced.

According to Falk, Parsi-Zoroastrians use a variant of ephedra, usually &quot;Ephedra procera&quot;, imported from the Hari River valley in Afghanistan.

===Botanic identification===
Since the late 18th century, when Anquetil-Duperron and others made portions of the Avesta available to western scholarship, several scholars have sought a representative botanical equivalent of the as described in the texts and as used in living Zoroastrian practice. Most of the proposals concentrated on either linguistic evidence or comparative pharmacology or reflected ritual use. Rarely were all three considered together, which usually resulted in such proposals being quickly rejected.
In the late 19th century, the highly conservative Zoroastrians of Yazd (Iran) were found to use genus&quot; Ephedra&quot;, which was locally known as &quot;hum&quot; or &quot;homa&quot; and which they exported to the Indian Zoroastrians. The plant, as Falk also established, requires a cool and dry climate, i.e. it does not grow in India (which is either too hot or too humid or both) but thrives in central Asia. Later, it was discovered that a number of Iranian languages and Persian dialects have &quot;hom&quot; or similar terms as the local name for some variant of &quot;Ephedra&quot;. Considered together, the linguistic and ritual evidence appeared to conclusively establish that was some variant of &quot;Ephedra&quot;.

In the latter half of the 20th century, several studies attempted to establish as a psychotropic substance, basing their arguments on the assumption that proto-Indo-Iranian * was a hallucinogen. This assumption relies on Rigveda . and reject this assumption, positing that &quot;souma&quot; was not hallucinogenic. Considering all 115 hymns dedicated to &quot;souma&quot; in whole, rather than the single hymn , and modern usage of &quot;Ephedra&quot; by practitioners, Falk and Houben conclude that &quot;Ephedra&quot; could be the only logical identity of &quot;souma&quot;. Moreover, the references to entheogenic properties were only in conjunction with a fermentation of the plant extract, which does not have enough time to occur in living custom.

In the conclusion of his observations on a 1999 Haoma-Soma workshop in Leiden, Jan E. M. Houben writes: &quot;despite strong attempts to do away with Ephedra by those who are eager to see * as a hallucinogen, its status as a serious candidate for the Rigvedic Soma and Avestan Haoma still stands&quot;. This supports Falk, who in his summary noted that &quot;there is no need to look for a plant other than &quot;Ephedra&quot;, the one plant used to this day by the Parsis.&quot;
==As a divinity () ==
The Yazata , also known by the Middle Persian name , is the epitome of the quintessence of the plant, venerated in the &quot;Hōm Yašt&quot;, the hymns of 9–11.

In those hymns, is said to appear before Zoroaster in the form of , a &quot;beautiful man&quot; (this is the only anthropomorphic reference), who prompts him to gather and press for the purification of the waters (see Aban). is &#x27;righteous&#x27; and &#x27;furthers righteousness&#x27;, is &#x27;wise&#x27; and &#x27;gives insight&#x27; (Yasna 9.22). was the first priest, installed by Ahura Mazda with the sacred girdle ( 9.26) and serves the Amesha Spentas in this capacity (&quot;Yasht&quot; 10.89). &quot;Golden-green eyed&quot; was the first to offer up , with a &quot;star-adorned, spirit-fashioned mortar,&quot; and is the guardian of &quot;mountain plants upon the highest mountain peak.&quot; (&quot;Yasht&quot; 10.90)

 is associated with the Amesha Spenta (Avestan, Middle Persian or ), the guardian of all animal creation. is the only divinity with a &quot;Yasht&quot; who is not also represented by a day-name dedication in the Zoroastrian calendar. Without such a dedication, has ceased to be of any great importance within the Zoroastrian hierarchy of angels.

==In tradition and folklore==

===In the legend of Zoroaster&#x27;s conception===
The Haoma plant is a central element in the legend surrounding the conception of Zoroaster. 
In the story, his father Pouroshaspa took a piece of the Haoma plant and mixed it with milk. He gave his wife Dugdhova one half of the mixture and he consumed the other. They then conceived Zoroaster who was instilled with the spirit of the plant.

According to tradition, Zoroaster received his revelation on a riverbank while preparing &quot;parahaoma&quot; for the Ab-Zohr (Zatspram 21.1), that is, for the symbolic purification of &quot;Aban&quot; (&quot;the waters&quot;). This symbolic purification is also evident in 68.1, where the celebrant makes good for the damage done to water by humanity: &quot;These offerings, possessing , possessing milk, possessing pomegranate, shall compensate thee&quot;.

===Traditional &quot;barsom&quot;===
It is possible that the &quot;barsom&quot; (Var. Avestan &quot;baresman&quot;) bundle of twigs was originally a bundle of Haoma stalks. The Haoma divinity is identified with priesthood (see Haoma as a divinity), while the &quot;barsom&quot; stalks &quot;cut for the bundles bound by women&quot; ( 10.17) is the symbol and an instrument of Zoroastrian priests. Today the &quot;barsom&quot; is made from pomegranate twigs (&quot;cf:&quot; preparation of &quot;parahaoma&quot; for the Ab-Zohr).

===In the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; ===
In Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, which incorporates stories from the Avesta (with due acknowledgement), Hom appears as a hermit, dweller of the mountains, incredibly strong. He binds Afrasiab (Middle Persian, Avestan: &quot;the fell Turanian &quot;, 11.7) with the sacred girdle, and drags him from deep within the earth (named the in Avestan, in middle Persian) where Afrasiab has his &quot;metal-encircled&quot; kingdom that is immune to mortal attack.

In another episode, Vivaŋhat is the first of the humans to press , for which Hom rewards him with a son, Jamshid. 9.3-11 has Zoroaster asking the divinity who (first) prepared and for what reward, to which Haoma recalls Vivanghvant (Persian: Vivaŋhat) to whom Yima Xshaeta (Jamshid) is born; Athwya (Abtin) to whom Thraetaona (Fereydun) is born; and Thrita to whom Urvaxshaya and Keresaspa (Karshasp and Garshasp) are born. The latter two are also characters in priestly heroic tradition, and among conservative Zoroastrians of the hereditary priesthood, Haoma is still prayed to by those wanting children (in particular, honorable sons who will also become priests).
The account given in the Indian Vedas closely agrees with that of the Iranian Avesta. The first preparers of Soma are listed as Vivasvat, who is the father of Yama and Manu, and Trita Aptya.

===Darmesteter===
James Darmesteter, in his 1875 thesis on the mythology of the Avesta, speculating on the Parsi belief that Ephedra twigs do not decay, wrote:... it comprises the power of life of all the vegetable kingdom ... both the Ved[as] and the Avesta call it the &#x27;king of healing herbs&#x27; ... the zarathustri scriptures say that homa is of two kinds, the white haoma and the painless tree. Could it be that soma is the tree of life? the giver of immortality?

The Indian-Zoroastrian belief mentioned above also manifests itself in the present-day Zoroastrian practice of administering a few drops of &quot;parahaoma&quot; to the new-born or dying (see Ab-Zohr). The belief also appears to be very old, and be cross-cultural. As Falk, recalling Aurel Stein&#x27;s discovery of Ephedra plants interred at 1st-century CE Tarim Basin burial sites, notes: &quot;an imperishable plant, representing or symbolizing the continuity of life, is most appropriate to burial rites&quot;.

=== In the &quot;Wizidagiha-i Zadspram&quot; ===
A legendary &#x27;White Hom&#x27; grows at the junction of the &quot;great gathering place of the waters&quot; and a mighty river. According to the &quot;Wizidagiha-i Zadspram&quot;, at the end of time, when Ormuzd triumphs over Ahriman, the followers of the good religion will share a &quot;parahom&quot; made from the &#x27;White Hom&#x27;, and so attain immortality for their resurrected bodies. (&quot;Zadspram&quot; 35.15)

==Comparison of haoma/soma==
Beyond the establishment of a common origin of and &quot;soma&quot; and numerous attempts to give that common origin a botanical identity, little has been done to compare the two. As Indologist Jan Houben also noted in the proceedings of a 1999 workshop on Haoma-Soma, &quot;apart from occasional and dispersed remarks on similarities in structure and detail of Vedic and Zoroastrian rituals, little has been done on the systematic comparison of the two&quot;. As of 2003, no significant comparative review of cultural/sacred Haoma/Soma had extended beyond Alfred Hillebrandt&#x27;s 1891 comparison of the Vedic deity and the Zoroastrian divinity.

All more recent studies that address commonality have dealt only with botanical identification of proto-Indo-Iranian *. Houben&#x27;s workshop, the first of its kind, dealt with &quot;the nature of the Soma/Haoma plant and the juice pressed from it&quot; and that &quot;the main topic of the workshop (was) the identity of the Soma/Haoma.&quot;

<text>The Mooloolah River National Park is a nationally protected area located on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. It covers an area of 830.9 hectares and is bordered by the Mooloolah River to the east, Claymore and Dixon Roads to the west, and the Lower Mooloolah River Environmental Reserve to the south. It is bisected by the Sunshine Motorway with the northern, 161.93 hectare component of the Park being a later addition. The Park was initially vacant crown land prior to national park designation in 1960. Surrounding land uses include livestock grazing, urban development and the campus of the University of the Sunshine Coast. It is the second largest mainland park on the coastal lowlands in South East Queensland after Noosa National Park and represents an example of low-lying coastal floodplain distinctive of the region.

The Jowarra section of the Park is located at the north western corner of the intersection of Steve Irwin Way (formerly Glasshouse Mountains Road) and the Bruce Highway. It is a remnant of coastal rainforest and cut off from the main body of the Park with the only connection via the Mooloolah River itself. The Park is used for conservation and study purposes and recreationally by bushwalkers and bird watchers.

The Park provides important habitat for numerous species endemic to eastern Australia and south east Queensland, owing its species diversity to varied ecosystem types and ecotones. It represents an important remnant of coastal heathland once common in the region and a refuge for the associated flora and fauna. Almost half the area of the Park is coastal and sub-coastal floodplain wet heath swamp and approximately one third coastal and sub-coastal floodplain tree swamp containing Melaleuca and Eucalyptus species in the Park&#x27;s wetland areas.

Seven of the 10 vegetative communities in the Park are regionally significant. The forest red gum (&quot;Eucalyptus tereticornis)&quot; along with the blackbutt-tallowwood (&quot;Eucalyptus pilularis-E. microcorys&quot;) are classed as &quot;endangered&quot; regional ecosystems under Schedule 1 of the Vegetation Management Regulation 2012 (VMR 2012). Five other regional ecosystems present in the Park are listed as &quot;of concern&quot; in Schedule 2 of the VMR 2012 including the paperbark teatree (&quot;Melaleuca quinquenervia)&quot; open forest/woodland, wallum banksia (&quot;Banksia aemula)&quot; woodland, scribbly gum (&quot;Eucalyptus racemosa)&quot; open forest, sedgelands and closed heath.

== Flora ==

With a variety ecosystem types and communities the Park is home to a wide array of endemic flora types, a number of which are threatened regionally. The Park contains three examples of flora listed as endangered under the &quot;Nature Conservation Act 1992&quot; (NC Act) and/or the &quot;Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (EPBC Act) and two species listed as vulnerable under both Acts. The Mt Emu Sheoak &quot;(Allocasuarina emuina)&quot; is listed both under the NC Act and the EPBC Act as endangered. A wind-pollinated shrub it is restricted to the coastal heaths of south east Queensland and was likely more widespread prior to encroaching primary production industries and urbanisation. The species is also highly reliant on fire regimes which have been altered due to urbanisation.

The swamp stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus conglomerata&quot;) is endangered under both the NC Act and the EPBC Act. The species grows in the margin between open forest and heathland in sandy acidic soils which are at times waterlogged. The Christmas Bells (&quot;Blandfordia grandiflora&quot;) plant is listed as endangered under the NC Act and is located in sandy acidic soils of damp heathland and sedgeland.

The &quot;Acacia attenuata&quot; is listed as vulnerable under both the NC Act and the EPBC Act and is endemic to South East Queensland. Populations persist close to the coast in the ecotone between wet heathland and open eucalypt forests within the Park. It relies on disturbance such as fire events for seed recruitment. The species can tolerate disturbed environments and has been observed in man made disturbed areas, easements and road reserves., The tiny wattle (&quot;Acacia bauera subsp. baueri&quot;) can be located in the Park and is listed as vulnerable under the NC Act.

== Fauna ==

=== Mammals ===
There are 19 species of mammals recorded in the Park. Macropod species include the eastern grey kangaroo (&quot;Macropus gignateus&quot;) and the swamp wallaby (&quot;Wallabia bicolor&quot;) with both also using the buffer zones around the Park. Other species include the short beaked echidna (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;), the eastern bent-winged bat (&quot;Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis)&quot; the little bent-winged bat (&quot;Miniopterus australis&quot;), four kinds of native rats, brush and ringtail possums, and flying foxes. Koalas (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;) have been recorded in the area and although listed as occurring within the Park in Queensland Government records, a viable population is not believed to be present in the Park apart from anecdotal records mentioning a population in the section north of the Sunshine Motorway.,

=== Amphibians ===
The Park is home to ten species of frogs including threatened ‘acid frogs’ termed as such by having the ability to inhabit acidic water bodies. Their preferred habitat is wet coastal heathlands with acidic waters (pH less than 5). Significant threats include the destruction of coastal wetlands and changes in water quality and availability. These species include the wallum froglet (&quot;Crinnia tinnula&quot;) listed as vulnerable in the NC Act, the wallum sedgefrog (&quot;Litoria olongburensis&quot;) listed in the EPBC Act and NC Act as vulnerable, and the wallum rocketfrog (&quot;Litoria freycineti&quot;) listed as vulnerable in the NC Act. These three frogs are also recorded outside the Park in the Lower Mooloolah River Environmental Reserve which provides a buffer zone and extension of habitat. Acid frogs can tolerate fire events as long as suitable water sources are available. The introduced cane toad (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;), prevalent across south east Queensland, is also recorded in the park.

=== Birds ===
The Park contains a wide assortment of bird species and up to 136 different species are listed. Significant species include eastern grass owl, sea eagles, various parrot species, goshawks, kites, the white-throated needle tail, egrets, herons, wedge-tailed eagles and wrens. The nutmeg mannikin, also known as the scaly-breasted munia (&quot;Lonchura punctulata&quot;), is an introduced finch species native to tropical Asia. It is able to tolerate disturbed environments and may pose a threat to native finches through competition. The Park is recorded habitat for the ground parrot (&quot;Pezoporus wallicus wallicus&quot;) listed as vulnerable under the NC Act. It is confined to heathlands and sedgelands and has numerous predators including the eastern grass owl, feral cat, brown falcons (&quot;Falco berigora&quot;) and snakes.

=== Reptiles ===
The Park is home for nine reptile species including the lace monitor (&quot;Varanus varius&quot;), eastern water dragon (&quot;Intellagama lesueurii&quot;), freshwater snake (&quot;Tropidonophis mairii&quot;) and the golden crowned snake (&quot;Cacophis squamulosus&quot;).

=== Insects ===
The park contains five species of butterfly – the common evening brown (&quot;Melanitis leda bankia&quot;), the monarch (&quot;Danaus plexippus plexippus&quot;), the Richmond Birdwing (&quot;Ornithoptera richmondia&quot;), and two types of jezebel (&quot;Delias sp&quot;.) one being the black jezebel (&quot;Delias nigrina&quot;).

The vulnerable Richmond Birdwing butterfly, occurring only in subtropical northern NSW and South East Queensland, is under threat from the removal of its already fragmented rainforest habitat. Its exclusive host plant, the Richmond Birdwing butterfly vine (&quot;Aristolochia praevenosa&quot;), listed as near threatened itself, is recorded both inside the Park and outside in areas to the south., The vine is under competition from other invasive weed species and outside the Park is affected by land and road side reserve clearing. The introduced Dutchman&#x27;s pipe vine is poisonous to the larvae of the Richmond Birdwing is a considerable regional threat, though not recorded in the Park as yet.,

== Environmental threats ==
The Sunshine Coast region is experiencing rapid urban expansion adding to environmental pressures on the Park. Urban development is encroaching on native bushland and reducing the effectiveness of the Park&#x27;s buffer zones making it more isolated from surrounding natural areas. Heathlands once common across south east Queensland are experiencing pressures from urbanisation and fragmentation, and species occupying those habitats are now under threat. Much of the habitat occupied by wallum dependent species such as the wallum rocketfrog, wallum sedgefrog and wallum froglet has been cleared for primary production, sand mining and residential development as these areas were once considered useless lands. The Park&#x27;s southern bordering areas are used as pastureland and also support a number of introduced weed species.

Multiple threatening processes affecting the Park suggest that management and observation of species numbers within the Park should be undertaken to ensure they do not decline unexpectedly, particularly if they already have certain specialized requirements. Altered burning frequencies resulting from the need to protect property and prevent a reduction in living amenity for nearby residents can have a detrimental effect on fire dependent species. The hydrological balance and water quality in the Park can be potentially altered by changes to surrounding drainage systems and for amphibians present in the Park this could put additional pressures for them in an environment that is already restricted, fragmented and in decline.

The Mt Emu Sheoak faces pressure from loss of suitable habitat, urbanisation and primary production outside the Park, and altered fire regimes and invasive species from within. The &quot;Acacia attenuata&quot; is also under threat from altered fire regimes, fragmentation and loss of habitat and, given its reliance on seasonally waterlogged areas, modified hydrological processes., Similarly for the swamp stringybark the main threats are clearing, drainage works, the invasive groundsel bush (&quot;Baccharis halimifolia&quot;), exotic grasses and too frequent burning.

Over the coming decades it is possible that species in the Park will be susceptible to the effects of climate change. Prolonged periods of drier conditions could mean less available water bodies for acid frogs and other amphibians to find refuge during fire events. Lack of rain also desiccates the Richmond Birdwing vine making it unusable for the Richmond Birdwing butterfly larvae as a food source. Alternatively, increased flooding events or drier conditions in the Park may affect water quality and favour some plant species over others. This is a distinct scenario for the spread of lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;) which as a result of climate change may experience conditions more conducive to its spread.

Invasive species

In addition to the cane toad, cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) and red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) are present in the Park. Cattle using grazing areas in the south access the Park&#x27;s southern borders and effect on native seedlings and trample vegetation.,

Up to 22 invasive plant and weed species are recorded in the Park. These include but are not limited to groundsel bush (&quot;Baccharis halimifolia&quot;), camphor laurel (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;) and lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;) which is listed as a Weed of National Significance. A variety of exotic grasses are also present.

== Park management ==
Management of parks, reserves and conservation areas in Queensland are guided by the Master Plan for Queensland&#x27;s Parks and Forests which sets out the vision, values, goals and strategic objectives of protected area management in the State.

The Park itself is managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) under the &quot;Nature Conservation Act 1992&quot;. Management of the Park and other parks in Queensland is under the direction of individual Management Plans – in this instance the Mooloolah Park River National Park Management Plan. The Plan provides an overview of the Park in terms of regional context, species composition, values, threatening process and outlines the key strategies to be employed in managing the Park. The broad management practices such as burn scheduling, weed removal and invasive species control are likely to yield positive results for most species suited to the habitats in the Park.

In addition to the Park&#x27;s Management Plan, many of the threatened species found in the Park also have their own recovery plans., Management planning for the Mt Emu Sheoak involves protecting and restoring habitat, translocation, managing fire regimes, stormwater runoff and invasive weed control strategies. Ongoing monitoring of populations as well as further study and community awareness play an integral part in the Mt Emu Sheok&#x27;s management. An understanding of the species’ genetics assists with translocation and determining appropriate fire management strategies. For the swamp stringybark it is much the same: monitor populations, assess genetic diversity, mitigate threats, and adapt management actions as required, including seed collection and storage and managing fire regimes. It is important for plant species with seed banks in the soil to have in place erosion and stormwater runoff controls to prevent their loss from otherwise suitable habitat.

Healthland communities are influenced by and rely on fire events for regeneration. Traditional burn frequencies have been altered due to increased burning to reduce fuel loads and to prevent the risk to property. An understanding of fire management across the Park in terms of the areas to be burnt, timing and its effects on the various ecosystem types is important and can affect species richness and distribution. Fire events that are too rare or too frequent can result in a loss of habitat and food sources for species that proliferate at certain times after fire. The current management strategy for burns is no more than 30% in any one year in an 8-12 year regime.

The Mooloolah National Park Management Plan specifies a number of guidelines for the planning and implementation of these burns. The Park also falls under the guidance of the QPWS Planned Burn Guidelines. The Guideline provides for specific fire management across the various vegetation communities in the region such as heathlands, open forest, woodlands and melaleuca communities as would be found in the Park. This allows for the tailored burning of these areas to provide the most optimal conditions for ecosystem health. The Guidelines also allow for the controlling of noxious weeds such as lantana and advice for the avoidance of peat fires.

The management of the areas surrounding the Park is important as many species located in the park are also located in the Park&#x27;s vegetated buffer zones. The species in these areas may face considerably more threats and less protection than what the Park affords but these areas provide a valuable buffer for the intra-park species and the benefits associated with a larger overall habitat. Undertaking management options in external areas, such as in the Lower Mooloolah River Environmental Reserve, including weed removal, stock exclusion and controlled burnings will assist in protecting the Park&#x27;s ecosystems and species.

<text>Moresby Range is a national park in the Cassowary Coast Region in Far North Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane. It is part of the Coastal Wet Tropics Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of lowland tropical rainforest birds.

The national park is located on the coast south of the mouth of the Johnstone River a few kilometres from Innisfail in the Cassowary Coast Region. The range reaches elevations of around above sea level. It belongs to the Wet Tropics biogregion and lies within the Johnstone River water catchment. About 8% of the park is classed as wetlands.

The Spectacled flying fox is the only rare or threatened species to have been identified in the park. In 2010, five cassowaries which inhabit the park were tagged with GPS dataloggers with VHF transmitters to enable monitoring of their movement.

<text>Gheebulum Kunungai (Moreton Island) is a national park which covers 98% of Moreton Island (Mulgumpin) in Queensland, Australia, 40 km northeast of center of the Brisbane. Its eastern part of he City of Brisbane. It has three main townships, Bulwer, Cowan Cowan and Kooringal.

The island is home to Queensland&#x27;s oldest operating lighthouse located at Cape Moreton on the northern tip of the island. The township of Cowan was home to the Australian soldiers during WWII and many relics remain on the island. Access to the park was restricted during a clean-up of oil from the 2009 southeast Queensland oil spill.

Activities such as bushwalking, fishing and watersports are popular in the park. Humpback whale can be seen in surrounding waters between late winter and spring.

In 2021 Moreton Island National Park was renamed to Gheebulum Coonungai National Park following the transfer of Moreton Island (Mulgumpin)&#x27;s ownership from the Queensland Government back to the native Quandamooka People. The names &quot;Gheebulum&quot; and &quot;Coonungai&quot; are the Quandamooka name of two spiritually significant sand hills within the national park.

==Flora==

The park contains mostly heath and open forests of scribbly gum and pink bloodwood, as well as the coastal she-oak. Other areas contain mangroves, sedge and melaleuca swamps.

==Access==
Access to the island is via the MICAT vehicle ferry service from Lytton, near the Port of Brisbane, the &quot;Tangalooma Flyer&quot; launched from Pinkenba or the &quot;Kooringal Trader&quot; from Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island. The &quot;Combie Trader&quot; barge service from Scarborough in Redcliffe City to Bulwer no longer operates.

===Camping===
Camping is permitted in specified campsites as well as within zones along eastern and western beaches.

<text>Mount Aberdeen is a national park in North Queensland, Australia, 961 km northwest of Brisbane, and 40 km south-west of Bowen. The Park is in 2 sections; the Mount Aberdeen section of 1840ha dedicated in 1952, and the Highlanders Bonnet section of 1370ha dedicated in 1967. The Park has no direct public access road or public facilities. Both Mount Aberdeen and Highlander&#x27;s Bonnet are composed of granite, with Mount Aberdeen summit reaching 901 m and Highlander&#x27;s Bonnet 624 m.

The park is notable for containing the sole regional occurrence of tropical cloud forest at the summit of Mount Aberdeen, with large areas of hoop pine (&quot;Araucaria cunninghamii&quot;) on the slopes of both peaks. Semi-evergreen vine thicket (subtropical dry broadleaf forest) is found in sheltered areas. There is also an unusual red gum-snow grass community in the park that is found nowhere else in Queensland. Mammals recorded in the park include unadorned rock wallabies, eastern grey kangaroos, common wallaroos, northern quolls and koalas. Found in the Park is the Mt Elliott grey ant, which is at its southern limit.

<text>Mount Archer National Park is a national park in Central Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane. It makes up the backdrop to the city of Rockhampton which marks the start of Tropical Queensland.

It comprises of open forests and woodland and its highest peak is Mount Archer which stands at above sea level. The Darumbal tribe Raki-warra clan considers the park as a part of its traditional country. It was explored by the Archer brothers in 1853 and was later named after them. In 1898, the site of the park was set aside as a water reserve and a timber reserve in 1940. The grazing went on until 1985 and later the area came under the supervision of the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. It became an environmental park in 1987 and was declared a national park in 1994. 

The vegetation is mostly open eucalypt woodland with patches of vine scrub. The rufous shrikethrush, white-browed scrubwren, powerful owl and glossy black cockatoo are some of the bird species found in the park.

A road leads to the summit of Mount Archer, where there are a few bushwalking and rock climbing opportunities.

<text>Mount Barney National Park is a national park in Queensland (Australia), 90 km southwest of Brisbane. It amalgamated the adjacent Mount Lindesay National Park in 1980. It is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.

==Geography==
Mount Barney, Mount Maroon, Mount May and Mount Lindesay rise majestically above the surrounding farmlands in Mount Barney National Park on the Queensland/New South Wales border. These rugged peaks are the remains of the ancient Focal Peak Shield Volcano which erupted 24 million years ago. Mount Barney (1359m) is the second-highest peak in south-east Queensland and has some very rare and unique plants. The town of Rathdowney is closest, 15 km to the northeast. 
 The park is dominated by the grand twin peaks of Mount Barney. Surrounding these peaks are numerous mountains, steep valleys, caves, deep rock pools and much woodland forest. The park also contains the peaks of Mount Ballow, Mount Ernest, Mount Maroon and Mount May.

== History ==
Mount Barney National Park and Mount Lindesay National Park were gazetted in 1947. In 1950, Mount Barney National Park was extended to include Mount May and Mount Maroon. In 1980, it was enlarged again incorporating Mount Lindesday National Park.

In 1994, Mount Barney National Park became part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia (formerly known as the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves) as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Accommodation==

Bush camping is allowed at Mount May and Mount Barney. Restrictions apply during peak holiday times.

==Flora and fauna==
The park has extremely varied vegetation with open forests around the foothills of the peaks, subtropical rainforest above 600m, montane heath shrublands towards the summit of the peaks, cool temperate rainforest on the summit of Mount Ballow, and mallee eucalypt shrublands on Mount Maroon. Many rare and unusual plant species grow in the park including the endangered Maroon wattle, and the rare mallee eucalypt &quot;Eucalyptus codonocarpa&quot;, Mount Barney bush pea and Hillgrove spotted gum.

Visitors to the park may notice the abundant birdlife due to their bird songs. A few playful platypus live in the park. The rainforest on Mount Barney provides critical habitat for the &quot;plumiferus&quot; subspecies of the marbled frogmouth. This bird is listed as vulnerable.

==Recreation==
There are expansive views over the Border Ranges and Scenic Rim forests from the summit of Mount Barney. The mountain is an old bushwalking destination by Australian standards and more than 30 routes lead to the summits of its East and West peaks. The majority of routes are not maintained by the Queensland State government and therefore navigational skills are mandatory, especially for first time visitors. The most challenging routes up Mount Barney include Logan&#x27;s Ridge and Short Leaning Ridge. Peasants or South Ridge is a better choice for less experienced climbers. Allow plenty of time for the ascent and descent, which require between eight and ten hours, depending on the route and level of fitness. Walkers need navigational and bushwalking skills and sound physical fitness. It is not unusual to meet climbers at all hours of the day and night, however prior knowledge of the area is required.

A popular alternative to going up and down South Ridge is to ascend via South East Ridge and descend via South Ridge. Navigational equipment or local knowledge are required for this route. The benefit of ascending via South East Ridge is that the track incorporates the East Peak. From the East Peak the track drops down into the saddle area at the base of the West Peak. The West Peak can be incorporated into this walk at an additional 2 km (allow two hours).

There are a few Class 4 walks around the base of the mountain that don&#x27;t involve as much navigation over terrain.

Nearby Mount Maroon is popular for rockclimbing. The first known climb to the summit of Mt Barney by a European was completed in 1828 by Captain Patrick Logan, by one of the hardest and most spectacular ridges on the mountain, named in his honour. Allan Cunningham and Charles Fraser were also in his company, however they did not reach the summit.

<doc id="103421" wikidata="Q1950299" url="?curid=103421" title="Mount Coolum National Park">
<text>Mount Coolum is a hill in Mount Coolum National Park in a suburb of the same name in Queensland, Australia. Mount Coolum is located on the Sunshine Coast, 101 km north of Brisbane. It lies between the Sunshine Motorway to the west, the shoreline to the east, Coolum Beach township to the north and Marcoola township to the south.

==Formation==
Created about 26 million years ago, Mount Coolum is a laccolith, formed when a dome-shaped bulge of magma cooled below the Earth&#x27;s surface, roughly circular in plan with tall cliffs on the eastern and southern side. It rises abruptly from the coastal plain to a 208 m peak, resembling the Glasshouse Mountains to the south. Mount Coolum is largely formed from 26 million year old rhyolite which forms regular columns and jointing patterns. A disused quarry occupies the eastern foothills of the mountain. After heavy rain there are a number of waterfalls on the cliffs.

==Climbing Mount Coolum==
A 1.6 km long track climbs Mount Coolum from the east, starting at a carpark on Tanah Street West off David Low Way in the suburb of Mount Coolum. The lower part of the track is deceptively well-formed and gentle but it quickly deteriorates to become very steep, very rough and dangerously slippery when wet.

The walk up and back can be completed in 30–40 minutes; it should not be started after rain or when rain, storms or dusk threaten. The peak hosts a cage containing an aircraft hazard obstacle light, necessary because of the mountain&#x27;s close proximity to the Sunshine Coast Airport. On average about 140 people climb to the summit each day.

==Ecological values==
The park is noted for its remarkable botanical diversity; more than 700 different species of plant have been identified there. Vegetation types include eucalypt forest, coastal wallum, paperbark wetland, rare coastal montane heath and some rainforest.

A pair of peregrine falcons are reported to nest on the cliffs.

<text>Vieques Air Link (VAL, IATA code: V4) is a small VFR(Visual Flight Rules) Puerto Rico-based airline that operates under FAR Part 135, that links Vieques and Culebra with mainland Puerto Rico.

== History ==
Operations began during 1965, with owner Osvaldo &quot;Val&quot; Gonzalez-Duriex piloting a plane with three passengers from Vieques to Humacao. A Cherokee aircraft and another airplane were also acquired later, allowing the airline to serve Isla Verde International Airport.

In 1968, Vieques Air Link added a flight to St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.

In 1980 Fajardo Airport in Fajardo was built and Vieques Air Link started flights to the new airport immediately. In the 1980s the company increased the frequency of flights to San Juan, Humacao and Culebra. In 1989, Vieques Air Link lost its entire fleet to Hurricane Hugo. However, it soon acquired seven Britten-Norman Islanders and three Trislanders.

In the 1990s VAL got into financial trouble. However, with the Vieques conflict, more and more Puerto Ricans began flying Vieques Air Link every day to go to military camps to protest, and the police also had to fly their personnel and the people arrested in those areas on VAL planes at various times. Others, like political leaders Ruben Berrios and Fernando Martín, and the 2002 Miss Puerto Rico Carla Tricoli, who is a Viequense, have had pictures taken by the press aboard VAL planes while flying to Vieques, giving the airline a new wave of unpaid-for promotional attention. In addition, in June 2000, the airline made the cover of Islander News magazine, under the headline &quot;Vieques Air Link: How To Survive a Hurricane&quot;, about the airline&#x27;s fleet loss of 1989 and how it survived the potentially fatal financial disaster.

In 2008, VAL added a new route between Antonio Rivera Rodríguez Airport (TJVQ) in Vieques and the new José Aponte de la Torre Airport (TJRV) at the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Base (NRR) in Ceiba, shortening the flight between Vieques and the Puerto Rican mainland to seven or eight minutes in a Britten-Norman Islander (BN2P), or Piper Cherokee (PA-32-260).

== Destinations ==
Vieques Air Link, Inc provides flights at the following locations:

== Fleet ==
*

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On December 21, 1971, an Islander, N589JA, with 1 crew and 7 passengers crashed at Culebra airport. The aircraft bounced on landing. The pilot initiated a go-around over hills. The aircraft was unable to clear a house and crashed.
* On December 19, 1977, an Islander, N862JA, crashed en route from St. Croix to Vieques when both engines stopped due to fuel exhaustion. The aircraft was ditched off Vieques. There were 9 passengers and a pilot on board. Five were killed and the aircraft was written off.
* On January 26, 1980, a bomb was found on a Vieques Air Link plane that was about to be flown by Raul Mari Pesquera, son of Juan Mari Bras (in Spanish).
* On August 2, 1984, an Islander, N589SA, operating as Vieques Air Link Flight 901A, crashed on initial climb out of Vieques en route to St. Croix. The Islander was overloaded by 600–700 pounds when it departed Vieques. Also, its centre of gravity was up to 5 inches behind the aft limit. After takeoff the left engine lost power. It lost altitude, banked abruptly to the left, nosed down and crashed into the ocean. It appeared that the fuel had been contaminated with water. On board were the pilot and 8 passengers, all were killed.
* On September 21, 1989, the following Islanders were damaged beyond repair by Hurricane Hugo.
**N112JC
**N290VL
**N457SA
* On November 19, 1999, an Islander, N907VL, was damaged beyond repair at Anguilla Wallblake Airport by Hurricane Lenny.
* On May 6, 2000, a Vieques Air Link pilot allegedly flew a company aircraft over Camp Garcia, a restricted US Navy area, on a scheduled flight an hour after protesters had been removed from the area by FBI agents and U.S. Marshals, resulting in the suspension of the pilot.
* On June 2, 2020, 2 people died and one was seriously injured when a Vieques Air Link Piper Aztec crashed against two sailboats at San Juan Bay. It&#x27;s not clear which of the two San Juan airports the flight was heading to. This marked the first incident involving fatalities for the airline in almost 36 years.

<text>Mount Etna Caves is a national park in The Caves, Shire of Livingstone, Queensland, Australia, 544 km northwest of Brisbane. 

The park&#x27;s caves are the roosting site for more than 80 percent of Australia&#x27;s breeding population of little bent-wing bats. It is also one of the few places in Australia supporting a colony of the endangered ghost bat.

== History ==
The Fitzroy Caves National Park was gazetted in 1973 with a focus on the protection of the bats rather than the caves. In 1990, it was renamed Mount Etna Caves National Park. In 1999, the park was extended to provide more protection to the caves.

<text>Baga National Park (formerly known as Mount Jim Crow National Park) is a national park in Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane.

It lies just beside the main road between Rockhampton and Yeppoon. Camping is not permitted in the park and there are no facilities.

The main feature of the park is Baga, a trachyte plug which is a remnant of an extinct volcano.

The Darumbal people have traditionally regarded Baga as a significance place in their Dreamtime stories.

Many species of birds can be found in the park, most notably in Hedlow Creek lagoons, where they come to drink water, such as striated pardalotes, squawking rainbow lorikeets and Lewin&#x27;s honeyeaters.

<text>Mount Pinbarren is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 129 km north of Brisbane. It is located in Pinbarren, a locality in the Shire of Noosa. Mount Pinbarren lies within the South East Queensland bioregion and the Mary River catchment area.

The park protects the naturally vegetated slopes of Mount Pinbarren. It was established to preserve significant hoop pine complex microphyll vine forest and habitat for the endangered Coxen’s fig parrot.

Access to the park is limited as it is surrounded by private property.

==Commonwealth Heritage List==
Mount Pinbarren National Park contains a small sample of remnant araucarian notophyll vine forest more typical of drier areas further west. The park includes several uncommon and rare plant species. Clausena Brevistyla occurs on the summit, and is close to its southern limit here. The rare and endangered species, Baloghia Marmorata, has recently been found on Mount Pinbarren. The uncommon species, Grevillea Hilliana is present. A possible new species of cyperus grows on the summit. The peak represents a scenically important landmark for the area.

==Description==
This small National Park includes Mount Pinbarren, a prominent feature above the surrounding landscape. Much of the mountain has a rocky substrate. Mount Pinbarren is a rainforest island surrounded by cleared lands. Hoop pine (Araucaria Cunninghamii) is dominant. The araucarian notophyll vine forest (ANVF) is unusual in the district, as many of the species are representative of dry rainforest. Some other species present include Olea Paniculata, Ophioglossum Pendulum, Hodkinsonia Oratifola, Calophaniodes Hyhrophiloides and Tragia Novaehollandiae.

==Condition and Integrity==
Lantana Camara grows where the canopy has been distirubed. The exotic herb (Rivina Humilis) is widespread on the forest floor. In general, however, the condition is good.

<text>Mount Walsh is a national park in Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane.

A prominent landmark in the Biggenden region is the granite bluff area of Mount Walsh which rises to above sea level in the northern part of park. The summit has three peaks. Exposed granite outcrops, rugged ridges and steep forested slopes support a range of vegetation.

The &quot;Bluff&quot; area of Mount Walsh is located at the park&#x27;s northern end and is a prominent landmark of the Biggenden area. The park features sheltered gullies, rugged ridge lines with mountain areas with spectacular exposed granite outcrops and cliffs support a diversity of vegetation. Such diversity gives a home to many endangered animal species such as the powerful owl and grey goshawk. Visitors may also see peregrine falcons, dingoes, wallabies, eastern grey kangaroos and lace monitors.

A complex landscape has led to diverse vegetation communities which includes heath, shrubland, woodland, open forest and dry forest. There are patches of hoop pines in some gullies.

==Geology==
The geological history of the mountain began in the late Triassic period about 215 million years ago. Violent explosions emanated from a volcanic structure referred to as the Mungore Centre. Two large bodies of magma rose close to the surface where Mount Malarga and Mount Walsh are presently situated. Erosion has left the cliffs, buffs, gorges rocky pavements and tors seen today.

==Facilities==
Picnic and barbecue facilities are available. Bush camping is allowed in the park. No facilities are provided so visitors must be totally self-sufficient.

===Walking tracks===
A trail from the picnic area leads visitors through open eucalypt forest to a rocky creek gully fringed in rain forest, then on to lookouts over surrounding countryside. Experienced walkers can take the strenuous (unmarked) two and a half hour hike to Mount Walsh&#x27;s bare granite summit.

The national park features a number of unique and threatened ecosystems including rare examples of complex rainforest vegetation communities developed upon Basalt soils within the Cape York Peninsula bioregion.

Rainforest communities located within the national park include:

*Deciduous mesophyll/notophyll vine forest growing on alluvial soils.

*Semi-deciduous mesophyll/notophyll vine forest growing on floodplains. 

*Semi-deciduous mesophyll/notophyll vine forest growing upon structured red earth soils derived from Basalt.

*Semi-deciduous notophyll/microphyll vine forest growing on structured red earth soils derived from basalt in a shallow valley.

*Semi-deciduous notophyll/microphyll vine forest growing on exposed metamorphic and granitic slopes.

An additional threatened ecosystem located within the national park is a sclerophyll woodland dominated by Eucalyptus leptophleba, Corymbia tessellaris and Corymbia clarksoniana which has developed upon soils formed from basalt flows.

<text>Scouting in Kentucky has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. Kentucky has a very early Scouting heritage, as the home state of Daniel Carter (Uncle Dan) Beard.

==Early history (1908–1950)==
Burnside, in south-central Kentucky, is believed to be home to the first Boy Scout troop in the United States. In 1908, two years before the Boy Scouts of America was officially organized, Mrs. Myra Greeno Bass organized a local troop of 15 boys, using official Boy Scout materials she had acquired from England. A sign at the edge of town declares Burnside &quot;Birthplace of Boy Scouts in America&quot;, and an official state historical society marker commemorates the troop. Burnside is now part of the Blue Grass Council.

Boy Scouts of America Troop 1 in Frankfort, Kentucky was established in 1909 by Stanley A. Harris. There has been a long-standing belief that this was the very first Boy Scout troop in the United States. However, Troop 1 was originally formed under the British Boy Scouts and the charter was destroyed in a fire around 1920. Nonetheless, Troop 1 is still active and is sponsored by the First Christian Church of Frankfort, Kentucky.

Outside of Frankfort, in towns like Danville, Kentucky in Boyle County, 3 new troops organized in December 1911. Troop 1, Christian Church with nelson Rodes as Scoutmaster, Troop 2, Centenary Methodist Church with Sandridge as Scoutmaster, and Troop 3, Presbyterian Church, no Scoutmaster listed. Of these, Troop 1 continues today as Troop 326 and Troop 2 continues today as Troop 27.

In addition, small councils began in a number of places, with the Issac Shelby Area Council that was made up of Mercer, Boyle, and Jessamine Counties, with and the Daniel Boone Council of Winchester, Kentucky and the Frankfort Council.
These were among the councils who merged to create the Blue Grass Council in 1927 in Lexington, Kentucky.

Kentucky also claims an early unofficial girl&#x27;s scouting group (Campfire Girls were one of three groups as affiliated girl&#x27;s version of Boy Scouts at the time. &quot;Girl Scouts&quot; formed March 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low in Savannah, GA and years later they could not work out a deal to merge with the Campfire Girls. Campfire Girls (1) A group called &quot;Girl Scouts,&quot; that had been organized in 1910 in Des Moines, Iowa, by Clara A. Lisetor-Lane;
(2) A group called &quot;Girl Guides,&quot; that had been sponsored in 1910 by the Rev. David Ferry of Spokane, Washington;
(3) Camp Fire Girls, which had been announced in April 1911 in New York..), an 8 girl patrol of Boy Scout Troop #17 in Louisville in July 1911. The first official troops was formed in 1917 in Scottsville.

In 1914, the BSA gave local councils the power to ban African Americans from Scouting. In 1922, the BSA revised that ban and allowed local Councils to create &quot;shadow Councils&quot; for their black and other racial/ethnic minorities. Until 1974, some southern councils of the Boy Scouts of America were still racially segregated. (The Old Hickory Council in North Carolina did not integrate until 1974.) The Louisville Area Council, headquartered in Louisville, was the first BSA local Council to develop such a &quot;shadow Council&quot; and board members of that &quot;inter-racial council&quot; were permitted to serve on the Louisville Area Council&#x27;s board without vote. The BSA&#x27;s &quot;inter-racial council&quot; program ended in 1954; Louisville accepted their first black Boy Scout Troops in 1959; and their first black Cub Scout Packs in 1963.

Most Girl Scouts of the USA units were originally segregated by race according to state and local laws and customs. By the 1950s, the GSUSA began significant national efforts to desegregate the camps and maintain racial balance. One of the first desegregations was Camp Shantituck in Kentucky, which was accomplished by Murray Walls in 1956.

==Scouting in Kentucky today==
There are six BSA local councils in Kentucky. Two councils are headquartered in Kentucky (Blue Grass and Lincoln Heritage). The other four councils are headquartered in neighboring states (Ohio, West Virginia, and Tennessee). All of Kentucky lies within the Eastern Region of the BSA.

===Blue Grass Council===
* Elkhorn District
* Lake Cumberland District
* Lonesome Pine District
* Mountain Laurel District
* Palisades District (formed by combining Henry Clay District with part of Midland Trails and part of the former Wilderness Trail District)
* Shawnee District (Former Midland Trails District)

===Buckskin Council===

The Buckskin Council serves Scouts in Scouts in Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia.

===Dan Beard Council===
The Dan Beard Council serves Scouts in Ohio and Kentucky. The Council underwent a realignment in June 2006. Several districts were combined.

===Lincoln Heritage Council===

The Lincoln Heritage Council serves 64 counties in four states: Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Tennessee.

===Middle Tennessee Council===

Covers parts of Trigg and Christian Counties that are part of Fort Campbell, KY.

===Simon Kenton Council===
In the 1990s, the BSA went through a restructuring in an attempt to reduce manpower, and in several states small historic Councils were merged into a larger &quot;supercouncil&quot;. The new Simon Kenton Council, serving Ohio and Kentucky, is an example of such a supercouncil.

Includes Kentucky County: Greenup.

==Girl Scouting in Kentucky==
There are two Girl Scout councils in Kentucky.

===Girl Scouts of Kentuckiana===
Girl Scouts of Kentuckiana serves nearly 20,000 girls in 64 counties in
western Kentucky, southern Indiana, and South Fulton in Obion County, Tennessee.

The Girl Scouts of Tulip Trace Council recently dissolved, with Girl Scouts of Kentuckiana gaining 4 counties in southern Indiana.

<doc id="103437" wikidata="Q412152" url="?curid=103437" title="Peptide nucleic acid">
<text>Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is an artificially synthesized polymer similar to DNA or RNA.

Synthetic peptide nucleic acid oligomers have been used in recent years in molecular biology procedures, diagnostic assays, and antisense therapies. Due to their higher binding strength, it is not necessary to design long PNA oligomers for use in these roles, which usually require oligonucleotide probes of 20–25 bases. The main concern of the length of the PNA-oligomers is to guarantee the specificity. PNA oligomers also show greater specificity in binding to complementary DNAs, with a PNA/DNA base mismatch being more destabilizing than a similar mismatch in a DNA/DNA duplex. This binding strength and specificity also applies to PNA/RNA duplexes. PNAs are not easily recognized by either nucleases or proteases, making them resistant to degradation by enzymes. PNAs are also stable over a wide pH range. Though an unmodified PNA cannot readily cross the cell membrane to enter the cytosol, covalent coupling of a cell penetrating peptide to a PNA can improve cytosolic delivery.

PNA is not known to occur naturally but N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine (AEG), the backbone of PNA, has been hypothesized to be an early form of genetic molecule for life on Earth and is produced by cyanobacteria and is a neurotoxin.

PNA was invented by Peter E. Nielsen (Univ. Copenhagen), Michael Egholm (Univ. Copenhagen), Rolf H. Berg (Risø National Lab), and Ole Buchardt (Univ. Copenhagen) in 1991.

== Structure ==
DNA and RNA have a deoxyribose and ribose sugar backbone, respectively, whereas PNA&#x27;s backbone is composed of repeating N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine units linked by peptide bonds. The various purine and pyrimidine bases are linked to the backbone by a methylene bridge (--) and a carbonyl group (-(C=O)-). PNAs are depicted like peptides, with the N-terminus at the first (left) position and the C-terminus at the last (right) position.

==Binding==
Since the backbone of PNA contains no charged phosphate groups, the binding between PNA/DNA strands is stronger than between DNA/DNA strands due to the lack of electrostatic repulsion. Unfortunately, this also causes it to be rather hydrophobic, which makes it difficult to deliver to body cells in solution without being flushed out of the body first. Early experiments with homopyrimidine strands (strands consisting of only one repeated pyrimidine base) have shown that the Tm (&quot;melting&quot; temperature) of a 6-base thymine PNA/adenine DNA double helix was 31 °C in comparison to an equivalent 6-base DNA/DNA duplex that denatures at a temperature less than 10 °C. Mixed base PNA molecules are true mimics of DNA molecules in terms of base-pair recognition. PNA/PNA binding is stronger than PNA/DNA binding.

== PNA translation from other nucleic acids ==
Several labs have reported sequence-specific polymerization of peptide nucleic acids from DNA or RNA templates. Liu and coworkers used these polymerization methods to evolve functional PNAs with the ability to fold into three-dimensional structures, similar to proteins, aptamers and ribozymes.

==Delivery==
In 2015, Jain &quot;et al.&quot; described a trans-acting DNA-based amphiphatic delivery system for convenient delivery of poly A tailed uncharged nucleic acids (UNA) such as PNAs and morpholinos, so that several UNA&#x27;s can be easily screened &quot;ex vivo&quot;.

==PNA world hypothesis==
It has been hypothesized that the earliest life on Earth may have used PNA as a genetic material due to its extreme robustness, simpler formation, and possible spontaneous polymerization at 100 °C (while water at standard pressure boils at this temperature, water at high pressure—as in deep ocean—boils at higher temperatures). If this is so, life evolved to a DNA/RNA-based system only at a later stage. Evidence for this PNA world hypothesis is, however, far from conclusive. If it existed though, it must have preceded the widely accepted RNA world.

==Applications==
Applications include alteration of gene expression - both as inhibitor and promoter in different cases, antigene and antisense therapeutic agent, anticancer agent, antiviral, antibacterial and antiparasitic agent, molecular tools and probes of biosensor, detection of DNA sequences, and nanotechnology.

PNAs can be used to improve high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of plant and soil samples by blocking amplification of contaminant plastid and mitochondrial sequences.

Cellular – Functional Antagonism/Inhibition.
In 2001, Strauss and colleagues reported the design of an application for PNA oligomers in living mammalian cells. The Xist chromatin binding region was first elucidated in female mouse fibroblastic cells, and embryonic stem cells though the use of a PNA molecular antagonist. The novel PNA approach directly demonstrated function of a lncRNA. The long non-coding (lncRNA) RNA, Xist directly binds to the inactive X-chromosome. Functional PNA inhibition experiments revealed that specific repeat regions of the Xist RNA were responsible for chromatin binding, and hence could be considered domain regions of the RNA transcript. The PNA molecular antagonist was administered to living cells and functionally inhibited the association of Xist with inactive X-chromosome using the approach for studying noncoding RNA function in living cells called peptide nucleic acid (PNA) interference mapping. In the reported experiments, a single 19-bp antisense cell-permeating PNA targeted against a particular region of Xist RNA caused the disruption of the Xi. The association of the Xi with macro-histone H2A is also disturbed by PNA interference mapping.
