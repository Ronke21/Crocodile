<text>Sharon Kay Penman (August 13, 1945 – January 22, 2021) was an American historical novelist, published in the UK as Sharon Penman. She was best known for the Welsh Princes Trilogy and the Plantagenet series. In addition, she wrote four medieval mysteries, the first of which, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Man&quot;, was a finalist in 1996 for the Best First Mystery Edgar Award. 

Her novels and mysteries are set in England, France, and Wales, and are about English and Welsh royalty during the Middle Ages. &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;, her first book, is a stand-alone novel about King Richard III of England and the Wars of the Roses. When the manuscript was stolen she started again and rewrote the book.

Her work was generally well received, with the more recent novels reaching the &quot;New York Times Bestseller List&quot;. Critics have praised her meticulous research of settings and events presented in her fiction, as well as the characterizations.

Penman died from pneumonia on January 22, 2021, at the age of 75.

== Career ==
Born in New York City, Penman grew up in New Jersey. She received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Texas at Austin, where she majored in history. She also received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Rutgers University School of Law, and worked as a tax lawyer before becoming a writer. While a student, Penman researched and wrote &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot; that chronicled the life of Richard III. When the 400-page manuscript was stolen from her car, Penman found herself unable to write for the next five years. She eventually rewrote the book and by the time the 936-page book was published in 1982 she had spent 12 years writing it, while practicing law at the same time. Of practicing law, she admitted she &quot;considered it penance.&quot; Penman lived in New Jersey, and in the early 1980s moved to Wales to research her second book, &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot;. She had a second home in the Welsh mountains where, she said, the history inspired her and provided material for her novels.

== Writing career ==
&quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot; is about the end of England&#x27;s War of the Roses. In the book, Penman characterizes King Richard III as a healthy, if misunderstood, ruler. She chose to write Richard&#x27;s character in such a way after becoming fascinated with his story and researching his life, both in the United States and in the United Kingdom, which led her to believe that &quot;his was a classic case of history being rewritten by the victor.&quot;

Once finished with &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot; she claimed to have become &quot;hopelessly hooked&quot; on writing. She had plenty of material to be written about the &quot;rebellious sons and disgruntled brothers and conniving kings and willful queens&quot; of the Plantagenets and hoped to write as many as a dozen books on the subject. After the publication of &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;, Penman began work on the Welsh Trilogy, set primarily in Wales. The &quot;Welsh Trilogy&quot; was followed by the &quot;Plantagenet series&quot;, which presents the events of the life of King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

Penman&#x27;s settings are all in the Middle Ages; the Welsh Princes trilogy is set in the 13th century, two centuries earlier than &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;. During her research for &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot;, the first book in the series, she became fascinated with the complexity of the role of women in medieval society; for example, Welsh women at the time had a great deal more independence than the English women. Whether in Wales or in England, a noble wife had responsibility for a household, complete with household knights, whom the wife relied upon to keep the household safe.

In 1996, Penman published the first in the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman&#x27;s first mystery, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Man&quot;, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explained her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: &quot;By the time I&#x27;d finished researching and writing &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot;, I was in danger of burning out. For the first time in nearly two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I&#x27;d choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history&#x27;s most memorable women.&quot;

Set in the 12th century, Penman presents the young Justin de Quincy as a medieval sleuth. In the first book he is elevated to the status of &quot;queen&#x27;s man&quot; by Eleanor of Aquitaine. &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Man&quot; and &quot;Cruel as the Grave&quot; depict the period after King Henry II&#x27;s death, as Eleanor, about age 70, rules the Angevin empire with one son (Richard) in captivity, and another son (John) hovering at the edge of power. The third novel in the series, &quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, is set during the same period, but Penman shifts the locale to northwest England and north Wales. And finally, in the most recent novel of the series, &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, Penman continues to show the conflict between mother and sons, and weaves in de Quincy&#x27;s conflicts as well.

In addition to the Edgar Award, Penman was the winner of the 2001 Career Achievement Award for Historical Mysteries from Romantic Times.

== Welsh Princes trilogy ==
&quot;Here Be Dragons&quot; (1985) is the first of Penman&#x27;s trilogy of novels about the medieval Welsh princes of Gwynedd. Of the novel, Penman stated, “I think &quot;Dragons&quot; is so popular because it was virgin territory for most readers. The saga of the Plantagenets was much better known, but not many people were familiar with medieval Wales or its princes. And then, too, the story of Llewelyn the Great and Joanna, King John&#x27;s illegitimate daughter, is a remarkable one, which struck an emotional chord with many readers.”

In &quot;Falls the Shadow&quot; (1988) Penman chronicles the family relationships of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. &quot;Falls the Shadow&quot; is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead her to the conclusion of the trilogy in &quot;The Reckoning&quot;. As Penman explained: &#x27;“After I&#x27;d finished &quot;Here Be Dragon&quot;s, I knew I wanted to continue the story… At first I&#x27;d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr&#x27;s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon&#x27;s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this was too much to tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote &quot;Falls the Shadow&quot; to Simon and &quot;The Reckoning&quot; to Llewelyn&quot;.

Penman&#x27;s characterization of Simon de Montfort is that of a man increasingly disillusioned by his sovereign, who rebels in 1263, becomes regent to Henry III, and attempts to re-establish rights granted under the Magna Carta. In addition to the story of Simon de Montfort and his wife, Eleanor the Countess of Pembroke and sister to King Henry III, the novel presents characters such as the Welsh ruler Llywelyn Fawr and London&#x27;s FitzThomas.

Of her research for &quot;Falls the Shadow&quot;, Penman explained: &quot;I did a great deal of on-site research, visiting the castles and battlefields that figured in Falls the Shadow, visiting the Reading Room at the British Library, the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, and local reference libraries… Here at home, I made use of the University of Pennsylvania Library in Philadelphia, which has an excellent medieval selection. But it really helped to see the scenes for myself. At Lewes, we actually walked along the same path that Simon de Montfort and his men would have followed. It was breathtaking to stand on the Downs, gazing out upon the same view that he would have seen&quot;.

&quot;The Reckoning&quot; (1991) chronicles the reign of England&#x27;s King Henry III in Penman&#x27;s final volume of the series that began with &quot;Here Be Dragons.&quot; The conflict between the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd who is the grandson of Llewelyn the Great of &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot;, and England&#x27;s King Henry III is one subplot. Additionally, Penman chronicles the life and character of Ellen, daughter of Simon de Montfort and niece to Henry III; her betrothal to Llewelyn (negotiated prior to de Montfort&#x27;s death); and the conflict between Ellen and her cousin Edward, soon to become King Edward, who opposes the betrothal.

== Plantagenet series ==

The Plantagenet series focuses on the Angevin King Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, beginning with the sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot;, the marriage of the Empress Maude and Geoffrey of Anjou, and Henry&#x27;s birth and childhood in &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept.&quot; Of Henry and Eleanor, Penman explained:
Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine were larger than life, legends in their own lifetimes. He was one of the greatest of the medieval kings, and she was the only woman to wear the crowns of both England and France. They loved and fought and schemed on a stage that stretched from the Scots border to the Mediterranean Sea. Their children were branded by contemporaries as &quot;The Devil’s Brood,&quot; but they founded a dynasty that was to rule England for three hundred years.

My first novel in their trilogy, &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot;, traces the beginning of their tempestuous union. &quot;Time and Chance&quot; continues their story at high noon. From the greenwoods of Wales to a bloodied floor at Canterbury Cathedral, theirs was an amazing story, and I very much enjoyed being along for the ride!

&quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot; introduces the genesis of the Plantagenet dynasty as Empress Maude fights to secure her claim to the English throne. In the 15 years she spent writing three novels and four mysteries set during the period of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine Penman claimed she found no villains. Instead she focused on the human characteristics: she believed Henry II was a brilliant king but a bad father. Of Eleanor of Aquitaine, she claimed she was a &quot;law unto herself&quot;, and Penman was intrigued by the role of a medieval queen.

&quot;Time and Chance&quot; (2002), a &quot;New York Times Bestseller&quot;, continues the story of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her husband, and focuses on the rift between Henry II and Thomas Becket. 

&quot;Time and Chance&quot; spans a 15-year period from 1156 to 1171 as Henry II became estranged from his wife (although Eleanor and Henry have eight children during thirteen years), and from his close friend and advisor Thomas Becket. King Henry&#x27;s decision to elevate Becket to the Archbishop of Canterbury becomes a fulcrum for discord between Henry and Eleanor.

&quot;Devil&#x27;s Brood&quot; (2008) opens with the conflict between Henry II, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their four sons, which escalates into a decade of warfare and rebellion pitting the sons against the father and the brothers against each other while Eleanor spends the period imprisoned by Henry. Penman places the characters against a tightly woven tapestry of medieval life, personal conflict, and dramatic characters.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brood&quot; was supposed to be the final volume in Penman&#x27;s Plantagenet series, but the &quot;Angevins were not ready to go quietly into that good night.&quot; &quot;Lionheart&quot; (2011) is about the children of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The book focuses on Richard the Lionheart&#x27;s Crusades in the Holy Land, and on what happened to Eleanor when she was finally released after spending sixteen years in a confinement that was ordered and enforced by her husband. &quot;A King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; is about the second half of Richard&#x27;s life, during and following his imprisonment, ransom, and life afterward.

== Writing characteristics ==

Penman&#x27;s approach to her novels is to present meticulously researched medieval life and history as everyday life, and to present the nobility as fallible. Set against a backdrop of political tension, power struggles, war, and hardship, the main characters confront personal drama such as conflict in love, conflict between family members, conflict with God, and conflict in friendship, as well as conflicted loyalties between family, self, king and country. A &quot;Library Journal&quot; review praises Penman&#x27;s attention to detail in which she &quot;combines an in-depth knowledge of medieval Europe with vivid storytelling, re-creating the complex events and emotional drama of the 12th – 15th centuries.&quot;
Although set in the 12th and 13th centuries, Penman sets the characters and narrative in her novels in medieval sites that still exist and can be visited, including castles, churches and archeological areas. Areas such as Aber Falls and Dolwyddelan Castle have important scenes in Penman&#x27;s novels. In &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brood&quot;, Penman sets the characters in scenes in a variety of medieval royal residences, castles and abbeys, in England and present day France, many of which still exist such as the Château de Chinon, Fontevrault Abbey, and Château de Loches.

<doc id="101700" wikidata="Q16251580" url="?curid=101700" title="Diophantine set">
<text>In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is an equation of the form &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;, &quot;y&quot;1, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;k&quot;) = 0 (usually abbreviated &quot;P&quot;(&#x27;,&#x27;) = 0) where &quot;P&quot;(&#x27;,&#x27;) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, where &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot; indicate parameters and &quot;y&quot;1, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;k&quot; indicate unknowns.

A Diophantine set is a subset &quot;S&quot; of formula_1, the set of all &quot;j&quot;-tuples of natural numbers, so that for some Diophantine equation &quot;P&quot;(&#x27;,&#x27;) = 0,

:formula_2

That is, a parameter value is in the Diophantine set &quot;S&quot; if and only if the associated Diophantine equation is satisfiable under that parameter value. The use of natural numbers both in &quot;S&quot; and the existential quantification merely reflects the usual applications in computability theory and model theory. It does not matter whether natural numbers refer to the set of nonnegative integers or positive integers since the two definitions for Diophantine sets are equivalent. We can also equally well speak of Diophantine sets of integers and freely replace quantification over natural numbers with quantification over the integers. Also it is sufficient to assume &quot;P&quot; is a polynomial over formula_3 and multiply &quot;P&quot; by the appropriate denominators to yield integer coefficients. However, whether quantification over rationals can also be substituted for quantification over the integers is a notoriously hard open problem.

The MRDP theorem (so named for the initials of the four principal contributors to its solution) states that a set of integers is Diophantine if and only if it is computably enumerable. A set of integers &quot;S&quot; is computably enumerable if and only if there is an algorithm that, when given an integer, halts if that integer is a member of &quot;S&quot; and runs forever otherwise. This means that the concept of general Diophantine set, apparently belonging to number theory, can be taken rather in logical or computability-theoretic terms. This is far from obvious, however, and represented the culmination of some decades of work.

Matiyasevich&#x27;s completion of the MRDP theorem settled Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem. Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem was to find a general algorithm that can decide whether a given Diophantine equation has a solution among the integers. While Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem is not a formal mathematical statement as such, the nearly universal acceptance of the (philosophical) identification of a decision algorithm with a total computable predicate allows us to use the MRDP theorem to conclude that the tenth problem is unsolvable.

==Examples==
In the following examples, the natural numbers refer to the set of positive integers.

The equation

:formula_4

is an example of a Diophantine equation with a parameter &quot;x&quot; and unknowns &quot;y&quot;1 and &quot;y&quot;2. The equation has a solution in &quot;y&quot;1 and &quot;y&quot;2 precisely when &quot;x&quot; can be expressed as a product of two integers greater than 1, in other words &quot;x&quot; is a composite number. Namely, this equation provides a Diophantine definition of the set

:{4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, ...}

consisting of the composite numbers.

Other examples of Diophantine definitions are as follows:
* The equation formula_5 with parameter &quot;x&quot; and unknowns &quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2 only has solutions in formula_6 when &quot;x&quot; is a sum of two perfect squares. The Diophantine set of the equation is {2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 17, 18, 20, 25, 26, ...}.
* The equation formula_7 with parameter &quot;x&quot; and unknowns &quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2. This is a Pell equation, meaning it only has solutions in formula_6 when &quot;x&quot; is not a perfect square. The Diophantine set is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...}. 
* The equation formula_9 is a Diophantine equation with two parameters &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2 and an unknown &quot;y&quot;, which defines the set of pairs (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2) such that &quot;x&quot;1 &lt; &quot;x&quot;2.

==Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem==

Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem, also called the Matiyasevich–Robinson–Davis–Putnam or MRDP theorem, says:

:Every computably enumerable set is Diophantine, and the converse.

A set &quot;S&quot; of integers is computably enumerable if there is an algorithm such that: For each integer input &quot;n&quot;, if &quot;n&quot; is a member of &quot;S&quot;, then the algorithm eventually halts; otherwise it runs forever. That is equivalent to saying there is an algorithm that runs forever and lists the members of &quot;S&quot;. A set &quot;S&quot; is Diophantine precisely if there is some polynomial with integer coefficients &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;)
such that an integer &quot;n&quot; is in &quot;S&quot; if and only if there exist some integers
&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;
such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) = 0.

Conversely, every Diophantine set is computably enumerable:
consider a Diophantine equation &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) = 0.
Now we make an algorithm that simply tries all possible values for
&quot;n&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot; (in, say, some simple order consistent with the increasing order of the sum of their absolute values),
and prints &quot;n&quot; every time &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) = 0.
This algorithm will obviously run forever and will list exactly the &quot;n&quot;
for which &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) = 0 has a solution
in &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

===Proof technique===

Yuri Matiyasevich utilized a method involving Fibonacci numbers, which grow exponentially, in order to show that solutions to Diophantine equations may grow exponentially. Earlier work by Julia Robinson, Martin Davis and Hilary Putnam – hence, MRDP – had shown that this suffices to show that every computably enumerable set is Diophantine.

==Application to Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem==
Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem asks for a general algorithm deciding the solvability of Diophantine equations. The conjunction of Matiyasevich&#x27;s result with the fact that most recursively enumerable languages are not decidable implies that a solution to Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem is impossible.

===Refinements===

Later work has shown that the question of solvability of a Diophantine equation is undecidable even if the equation only has 9 natural number variables (Matiyasevich, 1977) or 11 integer variables (Zhi Wei Sun, 1992).

==Further applications==

Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem has since been used to prove that many problems from calculus and differential equations are unsolvable.

One can also derive the following stronger form of Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem from Matiyasevich&#x27;s result:

:&quot;Corresponding to any given consistent axiomatization of number theory, one can explicitly construct a Diophantine equation that has no solutions, but such that this fact cannot be proved within the given axiomatization.&quot;

According to the incompleteness theorems, a powerful-enough consistent axiomatic theory is incomplete, meaning the truth of some of its propositions cannot be established within its formalism. The statement above says that this incompleteness must include the solvability of a diophantine equation, assuming that the theory in question is a number theory.

<doc id="101705" wikidata="Q272054" url="?curid=101705" title="Guinevere">
<text>Guinevere ( ; ; , ), also often written in Modern English as Guenevere or Guenever, was, according to Arthurian legend, an early-medieval queen of Great Britain and the wife of King Arthur. First mentioned in literature in the early 12th century, nearly 700 years after the purported times of Arthur, Guinevere has since been portrayed as everything from a fatally flawed, villainous, and opportunistic traitor to a noble and virtuous lady. The variably told motif of abduction of Guinevere, or of her being rescued from some other peril, features recurrently and prominently in many versions of the legend.

The earliest datable appearance of Guinevere is in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudo-historical British chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, in which she is seduced by Mordred during his ill-fated rebellion against Arthur. In a later medieval Arthurian romance tradition from France, a major story arc is the queen&#x27;s tragic love affair with her husband&#x27;s chief knight and trusted friend, Lancelot, indirectly causing the death of Arthur and the downfall of the kingdom. This concept had originally appeared in nascent form in the poem &quot;Lancelot&quot; prior to its vast expansion in the prose cycle &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot;, consequently forming much of the narrative core of Thomas Malory&#x27;s seminal English compilation &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. Other themes found in Malory and other texts include Guinevere&#x27;s usual barrenness, the scheme of Guinevere&#x27;s evil twin to replace her, and the particular hostility displayed towards Guinevere by her sister-in-law Morgan.

Guinevere has continued to be a popular character featured in numerous adaptations of the legend since the 19th-century Arthurian revival. Many modern authors, usually following or inspired by Malory&#x27;s telling, typically still show Guinevere in her illicit relationship with Lancelot as defining her character.

==Name==
The original Welsh form of the name is (also &quot;Guenhuibhar&quot;, &quot;Gwenhwyvar&quot;), which seems to be cognate with the Irish name (the name of the daughter of Queen Medb and Ailill mac Máta in the Ulster Cycle); Gwenhwyfar can be translated as &quot;The White Fay/Ghost&quot;, from Proto-Celtic &quot;*Windo-&quot; &quot;white&quot; + &quot;*sēbro&quot; &quot;phantom&quot; (cognate with Old Irish &quot;síabar&quot; &quot;a spectre, phantom, supernatural being [usually in pejorative sense]&quot;). Some have suggested that the name may derive from &#x27;, or &quot;Gwenhwy the Great&quot;, as a contrast to &#x27;, or &quot;Gwenhwy the less&quot;. Gwenhwyfach (also spelled &quot;Gwenhwyach&quot;) appears in Welsh literature as a sister of Gwenhwyfar, but Welsh scholars Melville Richards and Rachel Bromwich both dismiss this etymology (with Richards suggesting that Gwenhwyfach was a back-formation derived from an incorrect interpretation of &quot;Gwenwhy-far&quot; as &quot;Gwenhwy-fawr&quot;). A cognate name in Modern English is Jennifer, from Cornish.

The name is given as Guennuuar (&quot;Guennuvar&quot;) in an early Latin text &quot;Vita Gildae&quot;. Geoffrey of Monmouth rendered it in a Latinized form as &#x27; (&quot;Guenhuvara&quot; – but some manuscripts and thus modern editions also spell it with an M as in &#x27; or &quot;Ganhumara&quot;, possibly stemming from scribal error confusing &quot;uu/uv&quot; for &quot;um&quot;) in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, further turned into Wenhauer (&quot;Wenhaiuer&quot;) by Layamon (Gwenayfer in one manuscript) and into both Genoivre and Gahunmare in Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;. Chronicler Gerald of Wales refers to her as &#x27; (&quot;Wenneveria&quot;) and the popular romancer Chrétien de Troyes calls her Guenievre (&quot;Guenièvre&quot;). The latter form was retained by the authors of Chrétien-influenced French prose cycles, who would use also its variants such as Genievre (&quot;Genièvre&quot;) or Gueneure. Her many other various names appearing through the different periods and regions of medieval Europe include both Gaynour and Waynour (&quot;Waynor[e]&quot;) in the English poems Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; and &quot;The Awntyrs off Arthure&quot;, Genure (&quot;Gaynor&quot;) in the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot;, Guenloie in the &quot;Romanz du reis Yder&quot;, Guenore in &quot;Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt&quot;, Gwenvere (&quot;Guennevere&quot;, &quot;Guenera&quot;, &quot;Gwenner&quot;) in the &quot;Polychronicon&quot;, and Gwendoloena (Gwendolen) in &quot;De Ortu Waluuanii&quot;. Her name is invariably Ginover (&quot;Ginovere&quot;) in the Middle German romances by Hartmann von Aue and Ulrich von Zatzikhoven but was written Jenover by Der Pleier, and the audience of Italian romances got to know her as Ginevra (&quot;Zenevra&quot;, &quot;Zenibra&quot;). In the 15th-century Britain, she was called Gwynnever in the Middle Cornish play &quot;Bewnans Ke&quot;, while the Middle English author Thomas Malory originally wrote her name as Gwenever or Gwenivere (&quot;Guenever&quot;, &quot;Guenivere&quot;) in his seminal compilation &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. Some assorted other forms of her name in the Middle Ages and Renaissance literature of various countries and languages have included Ganor, Ganora, Gainor, Gainovere, Geneura, Guanora, Gueneour, Guenevera, Gwenore, Gwinore, Ntzenebra, Vanour, Vanore&quot;&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Wanore&quot;). 

==Medieval literature==
===Family relations===
In one of the Welsh Triads (&#x27;, no. 56), the 13th-century series of texts based on the earlier oral tales of the bards of Wales, there are three Gwenhwyfars married to King Arthur. The first is the daughter of Cywryd of Gwent, the second of Gwythyr ap Greidawl (a supernatural figure), and the third of Gawr (&quot;the Giant&quot;). In a variant of another Welsh Triad (&#x27;, no. 54), only the daughter of Gogfran Gawr is mentioned. There was once a popular folk rhyme known in Wales concerning Gwenhwyfar: &quot;&quot;Gwenhwyfar ferch Ogrfan Gawr / Drwg yn fechan, gwaeth yn fawr&quot; (Gwenhwyfar, daughter of Ogrfan Gawr / Bad when little, worse when great).&quot; An echo of the giantess-Guinevere tradition appears in a local legend regarding the Queen&#x27;s Crag boulder at Simonburn in England.

The earliest datable mention of Guinevere (as Guenhuvara, with numerous spelling variations in the surviving manuscripts) is in Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, written c. 1136. It relates that Guinevere, described as one of the great beauties of Britain, was educated under Cador, Duke of Cornwall. The other chronicles typically have Cador as her guardian and sometimes relative. According to Wace, who calls Cador an earl, Guinevere was descended from a noble Roman family on her mother&#x27;s side; Layamon too describes her as of Roman descent, as well as being related to Cador. Much later English chroniclers, Thomas Gray in &quot;Scalacronica&quot; and John Stow in &quot;The Chronicles of England&quot;, both identify Cador as her cousin and an unnamed King of Biscay (the historical Basque country) as her father.

Welsh tradition remembers the queen&#x27;s sister Gwenhwyfach and records the enmity between them. Two Triads (&quot;&quot;, no. 53, 84) mention Gwenhwyfar&#x27;s contention with her sister, which was believed to be the cause of the disastrous Battle of Camlann. In the Welsh prose &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; (possibly the first known text featuring Guinevere if indeed correctly dated c. 1100), Gwenhwyfach is also mentioned alongside Gwenhwyfar, the latter appearing as Guinevere&#x27;s evil twin in some later prose romances. German romance &quot;Diu Crône&quot; gives Guinevere two other sisters by their father, King Garlin of Gore: Gawain&#x27;s love interest Flori and Queen Lenomie of Alexandria.

Guinevere is childless in most stories. The few exceptions to that include Arthur&#x27;s son named Loholt or Ilinot in &quot;Perlesvaus&quot; and &quot;Parzival&quot; (first mentioned in &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;). In the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, Guinevere willingly becomes Mordred&#x27;s consort and bears him two sons, although the dying Arthur commands her and Mordred&#x27;s infant children to be secretly killed and their bodies tossed into the sea (Guinevere herself, who unlike Mordred seems to show little care for the safety of their children, is spared and forgiven by Arthur). There are mentions of Arthur&#x27;s sons in the Welsh Triads, though their exact parentage is not clear. The possibly medieval tale of &quot;King Arthur and King Cornwall&quot; has the latter having a daughter with Guinevere. Besides the issue of her biological children, or lack thereof, Guinevere also raises the illegitimate daughter of Sagramore and Senehaut in the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;.

Other relations are equally obscure. A half-sister and a brother named Gotegin play the antagonistic roles in the Vulgate Cycle (&quot;Lancelot–Grail&quot;) and &quot;Diu Crône&quot; respectively, but neither character is mentioned elsewhere (besides the Vulgate-inspired tradition). While later romances almost always named King Leodegrance as Guinevere&#x27;s father, her mother was usually unmentioned, although she was sometimes said to be dead (this is the case in the Middle English romance &quot;The Adventures of Arthur&quot;, in which the ghost of Guinevere&#x27;s mother appears to her and Gawain in Inglewood Forest). Some works name cousins of note, though these too do not usually appear more than once. One of such cousins is Guiomar, an early lover of Arthur&#x27;s half-sister Morgan in several French romances; other cousins of Guinevere include her confidante Elyzabel (Elibel) and Morgan&#x27;s knight Carrant (or Garaunt, apparently Geraint). In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, after the death of Guinevere, her relative King d&#x27;Oriande is a major villain who invades Arthur&#x27;s lands, trying to force him to abandon Christianity and to marry his sister, Queen Jandree. In &quot;Perceforest&quot;, the different daughters of Lyonnel of Glat (the greatest knight of the ancient Britain) and Queen Blanche of the Forest of Marvels (also known as Blanchete, daughter of the Maimed King and the Fairy Queen) are distant ancestors of both Guinevere and Lancelot, as well of as Tristan.

===Portrayals===
In Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, Arthur leaves her as a regent in the care of his nephew Modredus (Mordred) when he crosses over to Europe to go to war with the Roman leader Lucius Tiberius. While her husband is absent, Guinevere is seduced by Modredus and marries him, and Modredus declares himself king and takes Arthur&#x27;s throne. Consequently, Arthur returns to Britain and fights Modredus at the fatal Battle of Camlann. The &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; (&quot;Geste des Bretons&quot;) makes Mordred&#x27;s love for Guinevere the very motive of his rebellion.

Early texts tend to portray her inauspiciously or hardly at all. One of them is &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, in which she is mentioned as Arthur&#x27;s wife Gwenhwyfar and listed among his most prized possessions, but little more is said about her. It can not be securely dated; one recent assessment of the language by linguist Simon Rodway places it in the second half of the 12th century. The works of Chrétien de Troyes were some of the first to elaborate on the character Guinevere beyond simply the wife of Arthur. This was likely due to Chrétien&#x27;s audience at the time, the court of Marie, Countess of Champagne, which was composed of courtly ladies who played highly social roles.

Later authors use her good and bad qualities to construct a deeper character who plays a larger role in the stories. In Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, for instance, she is praised for her intelligence, friendliness, and gentility. On the other hand, in Marie de France&#x27;s probably late-12th-century Anglo-Norman poem &quot;Lanval&quot; (and Thomas Chestre&#x27;s later Middle English version, &quot;Sir Launfal&quot;), Guinevere is a viciously vindictive adulteress and temptress who plots the titular protagonist&#x27;s death after failing to seduce him. She ends up punished when she is magically blinded by his secret true love from Avalon, the fairy princess Lady Tryamour (identified by some as the figure of Morgan). Guinevere herself wields magical powers in &quot;The Rise of Gawain, Nephew of Arthur&quot;. The Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; has Guinevere commit the greatest treason by giving Arthur&#x27;s sword kept in her possession to her lover Mordred in order to be used against her husband. Throughout most of Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, a late-medieval compilation highly influential for a common perception of Guinevere and many other characters today, she figures as &quot;a conventional lady of [chivalric] romance, imperious, jealous, and demanding, with an occasional trait such as the sense of humor,&quot; until she acquires more depth and undergoes major changes to her character at the end of the book, arguably (in the words of Derek Brewer), becoming &quot;the most fascinating, exasperating, and human of all medieval heroines.&quot;

Such varied tellings may be radically different in not just their depictions of Guinevere but also the manners of her demise. In the Italian 15th-century romance &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;, Guinevere drops dead from grief upon learning of her husband&#x27;s fate after Lancelot rescues her from the siege by Arthur&#x27;s slayer Mordred. In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, it is Kay&#x27;s murder of her son Loholt that causes Guinevere to die of anguish; she is then buried in Avalon, together with her son&#x27;s severed head. Alternatively, in what Arthurian scholars Geoffrey Ashe and Norris J. Lacy call one of &quot;strange episodes&quot; of &quot;Ly Myreur des Histors&quot;, a romanticized historical/legendary work by Belgian author Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse, Guinevere is a wicked queen who rules with the victorious Mordred until she is killed by Lancelot, here the last of the Knights of the Round Table; her corpse is then entombed with the captured Mordred who eats it before starving to death. Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot; () features a prophetic dream sequence in which Arthur himself hacks Guinevere to pieces after beheading Mordred. Historically, the bones of Guinevere were claimed to have been found buried alongside those of Arthur during the exhumation of their purported graves by the monks of Glastonbury Abbey in 1091.

=== Abduction stories ===
A major and long-running Arthurian story trope features Guinevere being kidnapped and then tells of her rescue by either her husband or her lover. Welsh cleric and author Caradoc of Llancarfan, who wrote his &quot;Life of Gildas&quot; sometime between 1130 and 1150, recounts her being taken and raped (&quot;violatam et raptam&quot;) by Melwas, king of the &quot;Summer Country&quot; (&quot;Aestiva Regio&quot;, perhaps meaning Somerset), and held prisoner at his stronghold at Glastonbury. The story states that Arthur (depicted there as a tyrannical ruler) spent a year searching for her and assembling an army to storm Melwas&#x27; fort when Gildas negotiates a peaceful resolution and reunites husband and wife. The episode seems to be related to an Old Irish abduction motif called the in which a mysterious stranger kidnaps a married woman and takes her to his home; the husband of the woman then rescues her against insurmountable odds. A seemingly related account was carved into the archivolt of Modena Cathedral in Italy, which most likely predates that telling (as well as any other known written account of Guinevere in Arthurian legend). Here, Artus de Bretania and Isdernus approach a tower in which Mardoc is holding Winlogee, while on the other side Carrado (most likely Caradoc) fights Galvagin (Gawain) as the knights Galvariun and Che (Kay) approach. Isdernus is most certainly an incarnation of Yder (Edern ap Nudd), a Celtic hero whose name appears in &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;. Yeder is actually Guinevere&#x27;s lover in a nearly-forgotten tradition mentioned in Béroul&#x27;s 12th-century &quot;Tristan&quot;. This is reflected in the later &quot;Romance of King Yder&quot;, where his lover is Queen Guenloie of Carvain (possibly Caerwent in Wales).

Chrétien de Troyes tells another version of Guinevere&#x27;s abduction, this time by Meliagant (Maleagant, derived from Melwas) in the 12th-century &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;. The abduction sequence is largely a reworking of that recorded in Caradoc&#x27;s work, but here the queen&#x27;s rescuer is not Arthur (or Yder) but Lancelot, whose adultery with the queen is dealt with for the first time in this poem. In Chrétien&#x27;s love triangle of Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot, Lancelot rescues her from the land of Gorre. It has been suggested that Chrétien invented their affair to supply Guinevere with a courtly extramarital lover (as requested by his patroness, Princess Marie); Mordred could not be used as his reputation was beyond saving, and Yder had been forgotten entirely. This version has become lastingly popular. Today it is most familiar from its expansion in the prose cycles, where Lancelot comes to her rescue on more than one occasion.

There are furthermore several other variants of this motif in medieval literature. In Ulrich&#x27;s &quot;Lanzelet&quot;, Valerin, the King of the Tangled Pinewood, claims the right to marry her and attempts to carry her off to his castle in a struggle for power, possibly related to her connections to the fertility and sovereignty of Britain. Lancelot, acting as Guinevere&#x27;s champion, defeats Valerian and saves her from the plot. However, Valerin later kidnaps Guinevere anyway and places her in a magical sleep inside his castle guarded by dragons; she is rescued by Arthur&#x27;s party (including Lancelot) with the help of Malduc, wizard of the Misty Lake. In Heinrich&#x27;s &quot;Diu Crône&quot;, Guinevere&#x27;s captor is her own brother Gotegrim, intending to kill her for refusing to marry the fairy knight Gasozein, who falsely claims to be her lover and rightful husband (and who also appears as the young Guinevere&#x27;s human lover named Gosangos in the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;), and her saviour there is Gawain. In &quot;Durmart le Gallois&quot;, Guinevere is delivered from her peril by the eponymous hero, having been abducted by Brun de Morois in a scenario reminiscent of Valerin&#x27;s. In the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, she is briefly taken prisoner by King Urien during his rebellion against Arthur. The 14th-century Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym alludes to Guinevere&#x27;s abduction in two of his poems.

Another version of the narrative is associated in local folklore with Meigle in Scotland, known for its carved Pictish stones. One of the stones, now in the Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum, is said to depict Vanora, the local name for Guinevere. She is said to have been abducted by King Modred (Mordred). When she is eventually returned to Arthur, he has her condemned to death for infidelity and orders that she be torn to pieces by wild beasts, an event said to be shown on Meigle Stone 2 (Queen Venora&#x27;s Stone). This stone was one of two that originally stood near a mound that is identified as Vanora&#x27;s grave. Modern scholars interpret the Meigle Stone 2 as a depiction of the Biblical tale of Daniel in the lions&#x27; den. One Scotland-related story takes place in Hector Boece&#x27;s &quot;Historia Gentis Scotorum&quot;, where Guinevere is taken north by the Picts following Mordred&#x27;s and Arthur&#x27;s deaths at Camlann and spends the rest of her life in their captivity; after her death, she is buried beside Arthur.

This prominent story in its many versions may be ultimately of early Celtic origin. Medievalist Roger Sherman Loomis suggested that this recurring motif shows that Guinevere &quot;had inherited the role of a Celtic Persephone&quot; (a figure from Greek mythology). All of these similar tales of abduction by another suitor – and this allegory includes Lancelot, who saves her when she is condemned by Arthur to burn at the stake for her adultery – are demonstrative of a recurring &#x27;Hades-snatches-Persephone&#x27; theme, positing that Guinevere is similar to the Celtic Otherworld bride Étaín, whom Midir, king of the Underworld, carries off from her earthly life. According to Kenneth G. T. Webster, a scenario such as the one from &quot;Diu Crône&quot; may be an echo of a more ancient lore in which Guinevere is &quot;a fairy queen ravished from her supernatural husband by Arthur of this world and therefore subject to raids which the other world would regard as rescues, but which to the Arthurian world appear as abductions.&quot;

===Life in popular tradition===


The following narrative is largely based on the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; (Vulgate) prose cycle and, consequently, &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; as abridged by Thomas Malory with some of his changes. It tells the story of the forbidden romance of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere, initially in accordance to the courtly love conventions still popular in the early 13th-century France. However, their affair was soon afterwards directly condemned as sinful, especially in the Post-Vulgate Cycle retelling. Guinevere&#x27;s role in their relationship in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; is that of Lancelot&#x27;s &quot;female lord&quot;, just as the Lady of the Lake is his &quot;female master&quot;. Regarding her characterisation by Malory, she has been described by modern critics as &quot;jealous, unreasonable, possessive, and headstrong,&quot; at least through most of the work before the final book, and some of these traits may be related to her political qualities and actions.

In the 13th-century French cyclical chivalric romances and the later works based on them, including Malory&#x27;s, Guinevere is the daughter of King Leodegrance of Carmelide (Cameliard), who had served Arthur&#x27;s father, Uther Pendragon, and was entrusted with the Round Table after Uther&#x27;s death. The newly-crowned King Arthur defends Leodegrance by defeating King Rience, which leads to his first meeting with the young Guinevere. An arranged marriage of state soon commences, and Arthur receives the Round Table as Guinevere&#x27;s dowry, having ignored Merlin&#x27;s prophetic advice warning him not to marry her. This version of her legend has her betrothed to Arthur early in his career, while he was garnering support and being pressured to produce an heir (which Guinevere, barren as in most other versions, will fail to deliver).

When the mysterious White Knight (Lancelot) arrives from the continent, Guinevere is instantly smitten. The teenage Lancelot first joins the Queen&#x27;s Knights to serve Guinevere after having been knighted by her. Following Lancelot&#x27;s early rescue of Guinevere from Maleagant (in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; this episode only happens much later on) and his admission into the Round Table, and with the Lady of the Lake&#x27;s and Galehaut&#x27;s assistance, the two then begin an escalating romantic affair that in the end will inadvertently lead to Arthur&#x27;s fall. Lancelot refuses the love of many other ladies, dedicates all his heroic deeds to Guinevere&#x27;s honor, and sends her the redeemable knights he has defeated in battle and who must appeal to her for forgiveness.

In the Vulgate Cycle, Lancelot&#x27;s stepmother Ninianne, the Lady of the Lake, gifts them an identical pair of magic rings of protection against enchantements. In this version, the lovers spend their first night together just as Arthur sleeps with the beautiful Saxon princess named Camille or Gamille (an evil enchantress whom he later continues to love even after she betrays and imprisons him, though it was suggested that he was enchanted). Arthur is also further unfaithful during the episode of the &quot;False Guinevere&quot; (who had Arthur drink a love potion to betray Guinevere), her own twin half-sister (born on the same day but from a different mother) whom Arthur takes as his second wife in a very unpopular bigamous move, even refusing to obey the Pope&#x27;s order for him not to do it, as Guinevere escapes to live with Lancelot in Galehaut&#x27;s kingdom of Sorelais. The French prose cyclical authors thus intended to justify Guinevere and Lancelot&#x27;s adultery by blackening Arthur&#x27;s reputation and thus making it acceptable and sympathetic for their medieval courtly French audience. Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, however, portrays Arthur as absolutely faithful to Guinevere, even successfully resisting the forceful advances of the sorceress Annowre for her sake, except as a victim of a spell in a variant of the &quot;False Guinevere&quot; case. On her side, Guinevere is often greatly jealous for Lancelot, especially in the case of Elaine of Corbenic, when her reaction to learning about their relationship (which, unknown to her, by this time has been limited only to him being raped-by-deceit by Elaine, including an earlier act of the fathering of Galahad) causes Lancelot to fall into his longest period of madness (which only Elaine is able to eventually cure with the power of the Holy Grail itself). The episode of Lancelot&#x27;s exile and madness is also included in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot;, where it instead serves to accent the pathetic and humiliating nature of Lancelot&#x27;s illicit relationship with the queen. Malory is silent regarding Guinevere&#x27;s feelings for Arthur but goes so far as to suggest she uses charms or enchantments to win Lancelot&#x27;s love.

Years later, following the Grail Quest, Malory tells his readers that the pair started behaving carelessly in public, stating that &quot;Launcelot began to resort unto the Queene Guinevere again and forget the promise and the perfection that he made in the Quest... and so they loved together more hotter than they did beforehand.&quot; They indulged in &quot;privy draughts together&quot; and behaved in such a way that &quot;many in the court spoke of it.&quot; Guinevere is charged with adultery on three occasions, including once when she is also accused of sorcery. Their now not-so secret affair is finally exposed by Guinevere&#x27;s sworn enemy and Arthur&#x27;s half-sister, the enchantress Morgan le Fay who had schemed against her on various occasions (sometimes being foiled in that by Lancelot, who had also defended Guinevere on many other occasions and performed assorted feats in her honour), and proven by two of the late King Lot&#x27;s sons, Agravain and Mordred. Revealed as a betrayer of his king and friend, Lancelot kills several of Arthur&#x27;s knights and escapes. Incited to defend honour, Arthur reluctantly sentences his wife to be burnt at the stake. Knowing Lancelot and his family would try to stop the execution, the king sends many of his knights to defend the pyre, though Gawain refuses to participate. Lancelot arrives with his kinsmen and followers and rescues the queen. Gawain&#x27;s unarmed brothers Gaheris and Gareth are killed in the battle (among others, including fellow Knights of the Round Aglovale, Segwarides and Tor, and originally also Gawain&#x27;s third brother Agravain), sending Gawain into a rage so great that he pressures Arthur into a direct confrontation with Lancelot.

When Arthur goes after Lancelot to France, he leaves her in the care of Mordred, who plans to marry the queen himself and take Arthur&#x27;s throne. While in some versions of the legend (like the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, which removed French romantic additions) Guinevere assents to Mordred&#x27;s proposal, in the tales of Lancelot she hides in the Tower of London, where she withstands Mordred&#x27;s siege, and later takes refuge in a nun convent. Hearing of the treachery, Arthur returns to Britain and slays Mordred at Camlann, but his wounds are so severe that he is taken to the isle of Avalon by Morgan. During the civil war, Guinevere is portrayed as a scapegoat for violence without developing her perspective or motivation. However, after Arthur&#x27;s death, Guinevere retires to a convent in penitence for her infidelity. (Malory was familiar with the Fontevraud daughter house at Nuneaton, and given the royal connections of its sister house at Amesbury, he chose Amesbury Priory as the monastery to which Guinevere retires as &quot;abbas and rular&quot;, to find her salvation in a life of penance.) Her contrition is sincere and permanent; Lancelot is unable to sway her to come away with him. Guinevere meets Lancelot one last time, refusing to kiss him, then returns to the convent. She spends the remainder of her life as an abbess in joyless sorrow, contrasting with her earlier merry nature. Following her death, Lancelot buries her next to Arthur&#x27;s (real or symbolic) grave. 

==Modern culture==

Modern adaptations of Arthurian legend vary greatly in their depiction of Guinevere, largely because certain aspects of her story must be fleshed out by the modern author. In spite of her iconic doomed romance with Lancelot, a number of modern reinterpretations portray her as being manipulated into her affair with Lancelot, with Arthur being her rightful true love. Others present her love for Lancelot as stemming from a relationship that existed prior to her arranged marriage to Arthur, and some do not include the affair at all. In much of modern Arthuriana, Guinevere also assumes more active roles than in her medieval depictions, increasingly even being cast as protagonist.

===Literature===
* In the &quot;Deverry Cycle&quot; book &quot;Darkspell&quot;, the character of Gweniver is a warrior priestess sworn to the Goddess of the Moon in Her Darktime, also known as She of The Sword-Struck Heart. An inspirational warleader, Gweniver is a berserker in combat.
* In Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, Gwenhwyfar is brought up by a cold, unloving father, which leaves her with a deep inferiority complex and intense agoraphobia. Failing to produce an heir and unable to be with the love of her life, Lancelot, she falls into a deep depression and – hoping for salvation – becomes an increasingly fanatical Christian. Bradley&#x27;s version is notable for popularising the Welsh spelling, which many subsequent writers have adopted.

<text>Dungeon (originally published as Dungeon: Adventures for TSR Role-Playing Games) was one of the two official magazines targeting consumers of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game and associated products; &quot;Dragon&quot; was the other.

&quot;Dungeon&quot; was first published by TSR, Inc. in 1986 as a bimonthly periodical. It went monthly in May 2003 and ceased print publication altogether in September 2007 with Issue 150. Starting in 2008, &quot;Dungeon&quot; and its more widely read sister publication, &quot;Dragon&quot;, went to an online-only format published by Wizards of the Coast. Both magazines went on hiatus at the end of 2013, with &quot;Dungeon&quot; #221 being the last issue released.

==History==
=== TSR ===
&quot;Dungeon&quot; (initially titled &quot;Dungeon Adventures&quot;) first received mention in the editor&#x27;s column of &quot;Dragon&quot; Issue 107 (March 1986). Lacking a title at that point, it was described as &quot;a new magazine filled entirely with modules&quot; made available &quot;by subscription only&quot; that would debut &quot;in the late summer or early fall&quot; of 1986 and &quot;come out once every two months&quot;.

The publication&#x27;s original editor, Roger E. Moore, elaborated on this basic outline:&quot;Dungeon Adventures&quot; is a new periodical from TSR, Inc., in which you, the readers, may share your own adventures and scenarios from &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; and &quot;D&amp;D&quot; gaming with the legions of other fantasy gamers. Each issue offers a number of fairly short (but often quite complicated and long-playing) modules, selected from the best we receive.What kind of adventures do you want to see? We&#x27;re going to offer as broad a spectrum of material as possible: dungeon crawls, wilderness camp-outs, &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; modules, solo quests, tournament designs, &quot;Battlesystem&quot; scenarios, and more.

The premiere issue of &quot;Dungeon: Adventures for TSR Role-Playing Games&quot; was undated, but &quot;November/December 1986&quot; appears on the cover of the subsequent issue, and Moore stated that it had been released prior to the November issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s format consisted of 64 pages of short &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game adventures of various lengths, themes, and tones, written by both amateur and professional fantasy role-playing writers.

In conjunction with the first anniversary of &quot;Dungeon Adventures&quot;, Ken Rolston included a brief review in Issue 125 (September 1987) of &quot;Dragon&quot;. Regarding the modules themselves, he called them &quot;[c]heap and cheerful, full of the basic fun of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; games&quot;, and said that they reminded him of &quot;the selection of game sessions you find at gaming conventions or in old-fashioned modules&quot;. Rolston commented on the anthology format, which allowed writers to &quot;publish fine little bits&quot; and provided &quot;great training grounds for new writers&quot; that offered &quot;an opportunity to experiment with offbeat themes and tones&quot;. Rolston concluded that &quot;sophisticated gamers will find a lot to snicker at here, but there are some cute ideas&quot;, and added that the &quot;writing ranges from young and enthusiastic to polished, and when compared with some of TSR&#x27;s current modules...the quality of the layout and graphics is quite decent.&quot;

===Wizards of the Coast===
With the sale of TSR due to solvency concerns, the magazine came under the umbrella of Wizards of the Coast in 1997, and the company printed the next 30 issues. With the release of Issue #78 in January 2000, the long title printed on the cover was simplified from &quot;Dungeon: Adventures for TSR Role-Playing Games&quot; to &quot;Dungeon: Adventures&quot;. By Issue #82 (August 2000) it was simplified again to &quot;Dungeon&quot;.

=== Paizo===
In late 2002, Paizo Publishing acquired publishing rights to both &quot;Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine titles as part of a move by Wizards of the Coast to divest business ventures not related to its core business.

===Return to Wizards of the Coast===
On April 18, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced that Paizo would cease publication of &quot;Dungeon&quot; in September of that year. Scott Rouse, senior brand manager of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; at Wizards of the Coast, stated, &quot;Today the internet is where people go to get this kind of information. By moving to an online model we are using a delivery system that broadens our reach to fans around the world.&quot;

Coinciding with the release of the 4th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in June 2008, Wizards of the Coast launched a website that included online versions of &quot;Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Dragon&quot; magazines for subscribers. In this new format, &quot;Dungeon&quot; (now subtitled &quot;A Dungeons &amp; Dragons Roleplaying Game Supplement&quot;) retained its mandate to deliver adventures of varying lengths and levels as well as articles with information and advice for DMs. Mainstay columns such as &quot;Dungeoncraft&quot; (written by James Wyatt) were retained, and DM-focused articles that formerly appeared in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine (like &quot;Save My Game&quot;) were incorporated into &quot;Dungeon&quot;, making it a &quot;one-stop shop&quot; for DMs. The magazine shifted to a landscape format with the intent of making the articles and adventures more readable onscreen. Content was released daily and gathered into PDF compilations on a monthly basis. In May 2011, Wizards of the Coast stopped the monthly compilations and left content in single article format. In October 2012, Wizards of the Coast resumed monthly compilations.

====Cessation====
In the September 2013 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; (#427) an article by Wizards of the Coast game designer and editor Chris Perkins announced that both &quot;Dragon&quot; and its sibling publication &quot;Dungeon&quot; would be going on hiatus starting January 2014 pending the release of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition product line. The final online version was Issue #221 in December 2013. The successor magazine, called Dragon+, was subsequently released online on 30 April 2015.

== Content==
Each issue featured a variety of self-contained, pre-scripted, play-tested game scenarios, often called &quot;modules&quot;, &quot;adventures&quot; or &quot;scenarios&quot;. Dungeon Masters (DMs) could either enact these adventures with their respective player groups as written or adapt them to their own campaign settings. &quot;Dungeon&quot; aimed to save DMs time and effort in preparing game sessions for their players by providing a full complement of ideas, hooks, plots, adversaries, creatures, illustrations, maps, hand-outs, and character dialogue. It was a resource containing several modules per issue, significantly cheaper than standard-format modules.

From Dungeon&#x27;s founding in 1986, it published content that could be used in a variety of forms of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; systems, much like its sister magazine, &quot;Dragon&quot;. When Wizards of the Coast merged all &quot;D&amp;D&quot; product lines into one, 2000&#x27;s 3rd Edition, &quot;Dungeon&quot; published exclusively 3E content between September 2000&#x27;s issue 82 and July 2003&#x27;s issue 100, which shifted to 3.5E. With the release of 4th Edition in June 2008, issue 155 saw the 3.5E content dropped and focused exclusively on 4E. Like &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Dungeon&quot; was cancelled by Wizards of the Coast before the release of 5th Edition. 

===Polyhedron===
&quot;Polyhedron&quot;, the monthly membership publication of the Role-Playing Game Association, was combined with &quot;Dungeon&quot; into a single magazine beginning with Issue 90 (January 2002) and lasting until Issue 111 (June 2004). Many of the &quot;Polyhedron&quot; sections presented complete mini-games for the d20 system in genres other than fantasy.

Editor Erik Mona changed the format in September 2004, starting with Issue 114, discontinuing the &quot;Polyhedron&quot; component and focusing solely on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Each issue included three adventures, one each for low, medium, and high levels. A few issues each year also contained another substantial article which provided further details on the setting of one of the adventures (Previously, &quot;Dungeon&quot; almost never had features other than modules). Following the adventures and articles, many issues included the three-page &quot;Dungeoncraft&quot; column, at the time written by Monte Cook, as well as a handful of shorter articles on various subjects, collectively titled the &quot;Campaign Workbook&quot;.

===Adventure Paths===
Beginning in 2003, &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine featured episodic, multi-part adventures, referred to as &quot;Adventure Paths&quot;, which were designed to take a group of player characters from the beginning of their adventuring careers (1st level) through epic levels (20th and above). As of April 2013, four such serials were published: &quot;Shackled City&quot;, &quot;Age of Worms&quot;, &quot;Savage Tide&quot;, and &quot;Scales of War&quot;. In August 2005 the &quot;Shackled City&quot; Adventure Path was collected into a hardcover edition with various revisions and corrections, new background information, and a bonus adventure meant to fill a gap near the beginning of the series. Similarly, several shorter campaign arcs (typically consisting of three parts) and various sporadic, open-ended series and side treks were featured in these later issues.

<text>Lekotek is an international program to lend Assistive Technology, toys and expertise to disabled children. The first lekotek opened in 1963 in Stockholm, Sweden. From there the concept spread to other Scandinavian countries, Europe and the rest of the world. For example, there are over 50 lekoteks in the United States. The first American lekotek opened in Evanston, Illinois in 1980. The first US lekoteks were founded by Sally DeVencentis and Sharon Draznin.

The name is a mix of the Swedish root word &quot;lek,&quot; meaning toy or play, and the Greek suffix &quot;tek&quot; that connotes library.

==Underlying concept==
The underlying concept is that early intervention through play with adapted toys and technology can teach disabled children to deal with the &quot;normal&quot; world. Some of theoretical basis for the lekotek movement comes from work done by a British psychologist, Elizabeth Newson. Her book &quot;Toys and Playthings, &quot; () discusses the effect of play on child development.

==Launch of AblePlay==
In November 2005, the National Lekotek Center launched their new AblePlay website at www.AblePlay.org providing access to authoritative ratings and detailed reviews from National Lekotek professionals on loads of toys and other play products. Lekotek&#x27;s unique evaluation process yields product information categorized by disability category to further simplify the toy-buying experience. Parents and professionals can benefit from insightful play ideas for each toy, as well as from the online forums to allow them to share experiences and provide personal advice to each other. Launching AblePlay was an important step in realizing Lekotek&#x27;s goal to be the central source of information and support services involving toys and play for kids with special needs. National Lekotek is a division of Anixter Center which provides services to more than 5,000 adults and children with disabilities through 70 programs at 35 locations annually.

<text>Charlotte Lucy Gainsbourg (; born 21 July 1971) is a British-French actress and singer. She is the daughter of English actress and singer Jane Birkin and French singer Serge Gainsbourg. After making her musical debut with her father on the song &quot;Lemon Incest&quot; at the age of 12, she released an album with her father at the age of 15. More than 20 years passed before Gainsbourg released albums as an adult (&quot;5:55&quot;, &quot;IRM&quot;, &quot;Stage Whisper&quot; and &quot;Rest&quot;) to commercial and critical success. She has acted in many films, including collaborations with Lars von Trier, and received two César Awards and Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Best Actress Award, among many nominations.

== Background ==

Gainsbourg was born on 21 July 1971 in the Marylebone area of Central London to English actress and singer Jane Birkin and French musician Serge Gainsbourg. Gainsbourg was born at the height of her parents&#x27; fame; they had made headlines three years earlier with the sexually explicit song &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot; and by that point had become notorious for their turbulent relationship and multiple artistic collaborations. As a result, her childhood was well publicised.

At birth, she received the surname of Gainsbourg, her father&#x27;s stage name, but at the age of 18 she changed her surname to Ginsburg, her father&#x27;s legal surname. She has continued to use the Gainsbourg name professionally.

Her maternal grandmother was actress Judy Campbell, and her uncle is screenwriter Andrew Birkin, who directed her in &quot;The Cement Garden&quot;. She is a cousin of theatre and opera director Sophie Hunter. Gainsbourg&#x27;s father was Jewish, whereas her mother is from a Protestant background. Gainsbourg attended École Active Bilingue Jeannine Manuel in Paris and Collège Alpin International Beau Soleil in Switzerland. French is Gainsbourg&#x27;s first language, but she is also fluent in English.

Gainsbourg was raised in Paris alongside her half-sister, Kate Barry, from her mother&#x27;s marriage to composer John Barry. Kate Barry died in 2013 after falling out of a window. According to Birkin, both parents were somewhat neglectful, often spending their nights going out to parties and drinking. She has a young brother, Lucien &quot;Lulu&quot; Gainsbourg, born in 1986 from her father&#x27;s relationship with Bambou. On her father&#x27;s side she also had two older siblings born from his second marriage to Françoise-Antoinette &quot;Béatrice&quot; Pancrazzi.

By 1980, her parents&#x27; relationship had dissolved and her mother left her father for the director Jacques Doillon. Her half-sister Lou Doillon was born in 1982 as a result of the union. Gainsbourg would go on to work with her stepfather in the film &quot;The Temptation of Isabelle&quot; in 1985 and later in &quot;Amoureuse&quot; in 1992, which also starred her future partner Yvan Attal.

In 1987, she was the target of a bungled kidnapping.

After her parents separated, Gainsbourg&#x27;s father descended into alcoholism, eventually dying of a heart attack in 1991. Gainsbourg remained devoted to preserving his legacy and preserved his home, saying she hoped to eventually turn it into a museum. Maison Gainsbourg opened in 2023. 

== Career ==
=== Acting ===
Gainsbourg grew up on film sets, as both of her parents were involved in the film industry. She stated that her mother had pushed her into acting, believing that she wanted to be an actress and encouraging her to make her motion picture debut playing Catherine Deneuve&#x27;s daughter in the film &quot;Paroles et Musique&quot; (1984).

In 1986, Gainsbourg won a César Award for &quot;Most Promising Actress&quot; for &quot;An Impudent Girl&quot;. That same year Gainsbourg appeared in the film &quot;Charlotte for Ever&quot; about a man who develops incestuous desires for his teenage daughter after his wife dies. Written and directed by Gainsbourg&#x27;s father Serge Gainsbourg, who also took the role of Gainsbourg&#x27;s father on screen, the film heightened the controversy that had resulted from Gainsbourg&#x27;s debut single &quot;Lemon Incest&quot;, which had similar themes and also was created and sung with her father Serge, causing press speculation that the material was autobiographical.

In 1988, she appeared together with her mother in a set of films &quot;Kung Fu Master&quot; and the documentary drama &quot;Jane B. by Agnes V.&quot;, both directed by Agnès Varda. In 1993, Gainsbourg made her English-speaking debut in &quot;The Cement Garden&quot;, written and directed by her uncle, Andrew Birkin. Her stage debut was in 1994, in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Oleanna&quot; at the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse. In 1996, Gainsbourg starred as the title character in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, a film adaption of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s 1847 novel. In 2000, she won the César Award for &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; for the film &quot;La Bûche&quot;.

In 2003, Gainsbourg starred in &quot;21 Grams&quot;, with Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro. In 2006, Gainsbourg appeared alongside Gael García Bernal in Michel Gondry&#x27;s &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot;. In 2007, she appeared as Claire in the Todd Haynes-directed Bob Dylan biographical film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, also contributing a cover version of the Dylan song &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; to the film soundtrack. In 2009, she won the award for Best Actress at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival for the film &quot;Antichrist&quot;. Gainsbourg starred in the French/Australian production &quot;The Tree&quot;, released in 2010, and in Lars von Trier&#x27;s science fiction disaster film &quot;Melancholia&quot;. She was on the jury for the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012. In May 2012, &quot;Confession of a Child of the Century&quot; premiered, in which she starred alongside the British musician Pete Doherty.

Gainsbourg worked with von Trier once again on his 2013 film &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;, in which she played the title role. The 5½-hour film depicts the life of a sex addict from youth to middle age. Regarding her reservations about the part, Gainsbourg commented, &quot;The sex scenes weren&#x27;t so hard. For me, it was all the masochistic scenes. Those were embarrassing and, yes, a little humiliating.&quot;

In 2014, she starred in &quot;Three Hearts&quot; and Éric Toledano and Olivier Nakache&#x27;s film &quot;Samba&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Lumières Award for Best Actress. She then played Dr. Catherine Marceaux in &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot;, sequel of the 1996 film &quot;Independence Day&quot;. In 2017, she starred alongside Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson in the crime thriller film &quot;The Snowman&quot;. In 2020, she had a cameo role playing herself in the first episode of the fourth season of &quot;Call My Agent!&quot;.

=== Music ===
Gainsbourg made her musical debut on the controversial song &quot;Lemon Incest&quot; in 1984. Sung by Gainsbourg and her father Serge, the lyrics implied a pedophiliac relationship between a father and daughter and led people to believe that the material was autobiographical. Gainsbourg, who was 13 at the time of the song&#x27;s release, later stated that she had just begun boarding school and was therefore unaware of the controversy regarding the song until she was much older.

In 1986, she released her debut album &quot;Charlotte for Ever&quot;, which was produced by her father. In 2000, Gainsbourg was featured on the Madonna album &quot;Music&quot; on the track &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;. The lengthy spoken introduction by Gainsbourg is taken from the film &quot;The Cement Garden&quot;, which inspired the title of the song. The track was further remixed for a single version in 2001, with Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;The Cement Garden&quot; speech repeated during the song.

In 2000, Gainsbourg was featured on the Soundwalk Collective with Patti Smith album &quot;Peradam&quot; on the track &quot;The Four Cardinal Times&quot;.

In 2004, she sang a duet with French pop star Étienne Daho on his single &quot;If&quot;. In 2006, Gainsbourg released her second album &quot;5:55&quot; to critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching the top spot on the French charts and achieving platinum status in that country. In the UK, the album was moderately successful, reaching No. 78. (The single &quot;The Songs That We Sing&quot; only achieved No. 129.) Gainsbourg attributed the twenty-year break between her debut album and &quot;5:55&quot; to her father&#x27;s death and her reluctance to explore a musical career without him.

In late 2009, Gainsbourg released her third studio album, &quot;IRM&quot;, which was produced by Beck. One of the influential factors in the album&#x27;s creative process was her time spent filming &quot;Antichrist&quot;. Gainsbourg&#x27;s head injury in 2007 influenced the title of the album &quot;IRM&quot;, an abbreviation for the French translation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During her brain scan, she began to think about music. &quot;When I was inside that machine,&quot; she said, &quot;it was an escape to think about music. It&#x27;s rhythm. It was very chaotic.&quot;

Her song &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week on 2 March 2010. Her song &quot;Trick Pony&quot; appeared at the beginning of the &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; episode &quot;Perfect Little Accident&quot; (Season 6, Episode 16/airdate: 25 February 2010), is featured on the &quot;FIFA 11&quot; soundtrack, was used in the 2012 Teleflora Super Bowl advertisement featuring supermodel Adriana Lima and can be heard in episode 2 (&quot;Wild Thing&quot;) of the Amazon Prime Video television series &quot;My Lady Jane&quot; (2024).

In 2011, Gainsbourg released the double album &quot;Stage Whisper&quot;, a collection of unreleased songs from &quot;IRM&quot; and live tracks. In 2013, Gainsbourg released a cover version of the song &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, recorded with Beck, for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;, in which she was the lead actress. Her music influenced artists such as Tove Lo, who cited the simplicity and quirky lyrical content of Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;IRM&quot; as the main inspiration behind her career in music and said that it &quot;opened a new world&quot; for her as regards sound, and she performed a bilingual cover of &quot;The Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; in French and English as the opening tune for the Anglo-French crime thriller television serial &quot;The Tunnel&quot;. 

Since 2014, Gainsbourg has been supporting the Hear the World Foundation as ambassador. In her role she advocates for equal opportunities and a better quality of life for people with hearing loss. She was featured in the Hear the World Calendar 2014, the proceeds of which were to benefit the foundation&#x27;s projects.

Gainsbourg worked for four years, mainly in New York, with producer Sebastian Akchoté (known as SebastiAn) on her fifth studio album, titled &quot;Rest&quot;. &quot;Rest&quot; is a portrayal of her feelings after the deaths of her father Serge Gainsbourg and her half-sister Kate Barry, with the theme of alcohol addiction. About the album, she said, &quot;The album took a different direction. I wanted to express [my grief] not only with sadness but with anger.&quot; The lyrics are in English and French. In September 2017, music videos for the singles &quot;Rest&quot; and &quot;Deadly Valentine&quot; were released, both are directed by Gainsbourg herself. The music videos feature her children. The album was released on 17 November 2017. A companion EP for &quot;Rest&quot; was released the following year, titled &quot;Take 2&quot;. Gainsbourg additionally featured on Akchoté&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Thirst&quot; in November 2019.

Throughout late November 2020, Gainsbourg posted images to social media of her in the recording studio with Irish-Scottish music producer Salvador Navarrete, known better by his stage name Sega Bodega. Navarrete described the sessions as &quot;sounding beautiful&quot;. It was unveiled in September 2021 that Gainsbourg would appear on Navarrete&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Romeo&quot;, which was released on 12 November 2021. It is expected that more music between the two will be released.

== Personal life ==
Gainsbourg&#x27;s longtime partner is French-Israeli actor/director Yvan Attal whom she met on the set of the 1991 film &quot;Aux yeux du monde&quot;. Gainsbourg and Attal are not married, and Gainsbourg has attributed her reluctance to her parents never marrying. Attal publicly proposed to Gainsbourg on 19 June 2013, during an awards ceremony when he received the French National Order of Merit. In April 2014, Attal confirmed that they were still unmarried, with no plans to marry. Together they have three children, born in 1996, 2002, and 2011. Gainsbourg identifies as Jewish and celebrates Jewish holidays with her partner&#x27;s family.

Gainsbourg was born in London, but she spent most of her life in Paris until the death of her sister Kate Barry. In 2013, she and her family relocated to New York City. They returned to Paris in 2020. She is proud of both her nationalities.

On 5 September 2007, Gainsbourg underwent surgery for a cerebral hemorrhage. She had been experiencing headaches since a waterskiing accident in the United States several weeks earlier.

<doc id="101726" wikidata="Q947977" url="?curid=101726" title="Make Yourself">
<text>Make Yourself is the third studio album by American rock band Incubus. It was released on October 26, 1999, through Epic Records and Immortal Records. The album received double platinum certification by the RIAA and produced three charting singles—&quot;Pardon Me&quot;, &quot;Stellar&quot;, and &quot;Drive&quot;—all of which reached the top three of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart, with the latter topping the chart and also becoming the band&#x27;s sole top ten hit to date on the &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at number nine.

The album is the first to be recorded with new turntablist Chris Kilmore, who joined in February 1998 and replaced DJ Lyfe.

==Composition==

===Style and genres===
&quot;Make Yourself&quot; has been labelled as an alternative metal, nu metal, alternative rock, and funk rock album. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; claimed in 2001 that Incubus &quot;blur the perceptions between metal and alt-rock&quot; on the album. It has also been described as having more ambient tones than their previous work. In a 2000 interview, singer Brandon Boyd said that the band weren&#x27;t concerned about whether the album was going to fit into any particular music scene.

===Writing and recording===
The songs for the album were written following an exhausting tour for their full-length major label debut &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;. Touring for &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; began in mid-1997, once they had finished recording it, and covered the entirety of 1998, with the band playing over 300 shows that year alone. The &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; touring cycle concluded in January 1999, following a run of shows with Black Sabbath and Pantera. The shows with Black Sabbath were as part of their reunion tour, and Incubus was put on this tour on the insistence of the Osbourne family, who also put them on the 1998 edition of Ozzfest, since Jack Osbourne liked their music. Brandon Boyd reflected in a 2020 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; article, &quot;when we got home, we started coming up with ideas and gave ourselves eight weeks to write the record and in those eight weeks, all the songs that appear on the album came out.&quot; In a 1999 interview, Boyd mentioned that &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot; originated through improvisational live jams during the &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; tour, remarking &quot;we&#x27;ve been exploring drum-&#x27;n&#x27;-bass here and there on stage, playing little improvisational ditties in between real songs from the records. José would start playing a drum-&#x27;n&#x27;-bass he&#x27;d made up, I&#x27;d play my didgeridoo to it, and [it] started forming out of live things like that.&quot; For &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, turntablist Chris Kilmore intended to use a scratch record of sounds he had recorded over the years. However, it took two and a half weeks for Kilmore to get this record made, which led to him not being present for the early portions of the writing process.

While the album has since been considered to have a more accessible sound than their previous works, Boyd claimed in 2020 that &quot;we didn’t actually say out loud to each other that we needed to write a more commercial record; we just wrote in the same way we knew how to write and &quot;Make Yourself&quot; is what came out.&quot; However, guitarist Mike Einziger did note in 2020 that the band wanted to make the album more mature and less &quot;zany&quot; than earlier works such as &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;. In a 1999 interview from when the album was being written, he further said that it was going to have more &quot;ambiance&quot; and be more focused than &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;. In 2020, he stated there was a &quot;genuine creative desire to step up our artistry. We really wanted to become great songwriters [and] graduate from the zany music we spent our high school years writing.&quot; Einziger added that, &quot;I really wanted Brandon to be more vulnerable. We had conversations about that; some of them were uncomfortable. I felt like a lot of the music we’d written up until that point was personal but some of it was almost cartoonish, which is awesome and something that came very naturally to us, but I felt like we could really connect with people and write music that could make more of an emotional connection.&quot; 

Einziger also noted in a 2011 Ultimate Guitar interview that he knew the band&#x27;s change in direction would potentially alienate fans of their earlier work, which had more of an experimental funk-based sound. He compared the change in sound from &quot;S.C.I..E.N.C.E.&quot; to &quot;Make Yourself&quot; to the change in sound from 2006&#x27;s &quot;Light Grenades&quot; to 2011&#x27;s &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;, which saw the band temporarily go in a soft adult contemporary direction. In this same interview, he said when they started writing &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, he felt as though the band had naturally come &quot;to the end of an era&quot; with their music, saying this mirrored how they felt when they started writing &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;. He added that on both occasions, he felt like it was time &quot;to do something very different that was going to polarize the people who had been previously listening to us.&quot;

Tensions arose between band members during the making of the album, which led to them briefly entering group therapy. Boyd reflected on the tension in a 2001 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, saying that &quot;when we&#x27;re making music together, it&#x27;s like five men making love — in a very platonic sense. It&#x27;s very erotic because your spirits are intermingling, you&#x27;re becoming one. It&#x27;s also why it can get so heated. You&#x27;re tapping into this electricity that&#x27;s very primal.&quot;

Regarding his experience writing the album, Boyd remembered in 2020, &quot;when we were touring &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot;, I’d been with my girlfriend for quite a long time, and then it came to light that she’d been having an affair while I was gone, so I was dealing with a pretty high degree of heartbreak when I went into &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. The writing process ended up becoming like an open poetic therapy session for me. There was a little bit of anger, definitely heartbreak but also a sense of hope around finding a new love. From my point of view, the songs very clearly describe the arc of that experience.&quot; Prior to discovering the affair, Boyd had been dating this woman since 1991, which was the same year that Incubus formed. In a 2000 interview, Boyd said that when &quot;Pardon Me&quot; was written, he was also dealing with the deaths of a family member and a friend, in addition to these relationship troubles. He said that he was &quot;being bombarded by life&quot; at the time, and that this inspired the song&#x27;s lyrical themes. The lyrics to &quot;Stellar&quot; were inspired by Boyd&#x27;s new girlfriend Jo, who he met during the making of the album. She would later appear in the song&#x27;s music video, with Boyd saying in 2020, &quot;it was a very different kind of love than the love I experienced as a teenager. It felt much more expansive, hence the &#x27;meet me in outer space&#x27; imagery.&quot; Boyd wrote the melodies to the song after Einziger showed him the main guitar part for it.

Regarding the hit single &quot;Drive&quot;, Boyd said &quot;a lot of those topics are still things I wrestle with. The song is about reckoning with fear and uncertainty and I’m still in a kind-of active dance with that, as I probably will be my entire life&quot;, adding that &quot;just because you write something down, put a melody to it and a bunch of people like it doesn’t mean it was a thought that was complete – it’s not as if I became enlightened around the idea of not letting fear dictate the course of my life.&quot; Einziger said, &quot;I could never have predicted [Drive] was going to be a smash-hit song, but I knew that it felt special to us. It felt like an honest encapsulation of being vulnerable and I felt like people would connect with it.&quot; Before recording the final version that appears on the album, the band worked on a demo version of the song at their homes which closely resembled the final version, with Einziger saying, &quot;I remember [Brandon] singing the lyrics to me in the car as they appear on the album. The version we made before we recorded it properly was really the same.&quot;

When the album was being recorded at NRG in North Hollywood, Chris Kilmore had his own DJ setup in the hallway. He adds, &quot;there were a bunch of other bands there. 311 was there a lot of the time, and Jurassic 5 was there a lot of the time. And because I had that turntable setup in the hallway, I was always out there practicing and trying stuff.&quot; The day the instrumental song &quot;Battlestar Scralatchtica&quot; was recorded, Brandon Boyd was missing because he had a dentist appointment. Kilmore states, &quot;we weren’t going to waste a day. So we wrote a cool little track. I was out in the hallway scratching, and Nu-Mark and Cut Chemist walked by. I was like, &#x27;Hey. Do you guys want to scratch on this track we just did?&#x27;. We went in, laid it down, and that’s how &#x27;Battlestar Scralatchtica&#x27; came about.&quot; Around the time the record was being made, Kilmore also contributed DJ scratches to the album &quot;Introduction to Mayhem&quot;, by the nu/rap metal band Primer 55.

==Touring==
To support &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, the band and Buckethead opened for Primus on their &quot;Antipop&quot; tour in 1999, including at a millennium show on December 31, 1999. Early the following year, they performed at the SnoCore Tour with System of a Down and Mr. Bungle (who broke up shortly afterwards). The members of Incubus have since spoken of their pleasure at getting to play with Primus and Mr. Bungle, two artists whom they cite as influences. Mr. Bungle were met with a hostile crowd reception at some of the shows with Incubus and System of a Down. Mr. Bungle&#x27;s bassist Trevor Dunn remarked in 2013 that &quot;we were sort of the grandpas of the tour&quot;, adding that his band dressed up as the Village People at these shows in an attempt to anger the &quot;metal kids&quot; in the audience. Brandon Boyd later reflected in 2018, &quot;Mr. Bungle was hugely influential to both of our bands, and they were playing second, like before Incubus and System of a Down.&quot; He added, &quot;Mike Patton would be a real rabble rouser, and say horrible things to the audience. We would be on the side of stage cheering, fanboys.&quot; 

Following this, Incubus went on an American tour with 311, which lasted from late April 2000 to the beginning of July 2000. From August to early September 2000, the band performed at that year&#x27;s edition of Ozzfest. It was their second appearance at the festival, having earlier appeared at the 1998 edition. On October 12, 2000, the band performed the single &quot;Stellar&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. They had also performed the song on an August 2, 2000 episode of the &quot;Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;. Between October and November 2000, Incubus and Taproot supported Deftones on their &quot;Back to School&quot; tour for the album &quot;White Pony&quot;. 

==Release and commercial response==
Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, a death metal band from Louisiana called Incubus changed their name. Now known as Opprobrium, they had released two critically acclaimed albums in 1988 and 1990, titled &quot;Serpent Temptation&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Unknown&quot;, and were not aware of the Californian Incubus prior to the release of &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. The name change was voluntarily made in order to avoid confusion and any potential conflicts between the two bands. &quot;Serpent Temptation&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Unknown&quot; were sometimes incorrectly labelled as being early releases from the Californian Incubus, and Opprobrium eventually reissued these albums under their new name. A British hard rock/heavy metal band called Incubus had also released an album in 1984 titled &quot;To the Devil a Daughter&quot;, which was sometimes attributed to the Californian Incubus.

The first single &quot;Pardon Me&quot; was initially released to radio stations as an acoustic song, which led to the album version becoming popular as well. According to Boyd, it was Epic/Immortal Records that suggested &quot;Pardon Me&quot; be released as a single, telling MTV in 2000 that &quot;we wrote &#x27;Pardon Me&#x27; along with the whole album and never thought anything different about it.&quot; In August 2000, an EP titled &quot;When Incubus Attacks Volume 1&quot; was released, featuring the acoustic version of &quot;Pardon Me&quot; and acoustic versions of the songs &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and &quot;Stellar&quot;. The three acoustic versions of these songs originated from a November 1999 recording session in Chicago. The EP also featured additional material, including the song &quot;Crowded Elevator&quot;, which was recorded during the &quot;Make Yourself&quot; sessions. &quot;Crowded Elevator&quot; had earlier appeared on the soundtrack album for the horror film &quot;Scream 3&quot;, which was released in January 2000.

By the time &quot;Make Yourself&quot;&#x27;s final and most popular single &quot;Drive&quot; was released in November 2000, the band had already sold a million copies, with Einziger recalling in 2020 that, &quot;&#x27;Pardon Me&#x27; was a big deal for us, &#x27;Stellar&#x27; was the second song that came out and a big deal on MTV, and then when &#x27;Drive&#x27; came out it really pushed everything over the top.&quot; &quot;Drive&quot; managed to garner substantial airplay on non-rock stations, and in a 2001 &quot;Billboard&quot; interview, Boyd said that this fit with their philosophy of not creating music for any one particular group. Regarding their success around this time, Boyd remembered in 2020, &quot;the most stark change was that all of a sudden women were coming to our concerts so when people would cheer after a song, the pitch went up considerably.&quot;

In 1999 and 2000, music videos were made for &quot;Pardon Me&quot;, &quot;Stellar&quot; and &quot;Drive&quot;. Less widely seen music videos were also made for the non-singles &quot;I Miss You&quot;, &quot;Privilege&quot; and &quot;Out from Under&quot;. The video for &quot;Out from Under&quot; was originally meant to be released as part of the 2001 &quot;When Incubus Attacks Volume 2&quot; DVD, although it was not included as there was not enough space left on the disc. A tour edition for the album was released in 2001, with a second disc containing the three acoustic tracks and one live track.

==Reception==

&quot;Make Yourself&quot; has received generally positive reviews from critics. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that &quot;&quot;Make Yourself&quot; makes a bid for broader mainstream success while keeping the group rooted in a hybrid of familiar late &#x27;90s alt-metal (i.e., roaring guitars, white-noise sonic textures, and an undercurrent of electronics) and Chili Pepper funk-rock. Where &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; sometimes veered abruptly between the two genres without really fusing them, &quot;Make Yourself&quot; finds the band settling more comfortably into its sound.&quot;

Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; also gave it four out of five stars, writing in April 2001, &quot;whether it’s rehashed hard rock or a non-enterprising rap-metal hybrid, there isn’t much to differentiate between most rock bands these days. Incubus, however, sets themselves apart with their second full-length release &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. A superb blend of metal guitar riffs, classic punk-rock mentality, and subtle hip hop and electronic elements, Incubus doesn’t just imitate these genres, but rather, redefines them in an otherwise non-revolutionary rock landscape.&quot; &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) states that on &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, &quot;Incubus had found a beta-male approach to new-metal: roaring, assymetrical riffs and herky-jerky dynamics coexisting with Boyd&#x27;s yearning tenor and burgeoning melodic gift.&quot; In November 1999, &quot;Tulane Hullabaloo&quot; writer Henry Rienka claimed that it was a rap rock album in the style of bands such as Hed PE, despite consisting entirely of sung vocals. Rienka wrote that, &quot;their union of grinding guitar, vinyl scratching, and urgent rock/rap vocals produces thrashing, grooving, and bouncing boobies.&quot; He added, &quot;&quot;Make Yourself&quot; just doesn&#x27;t quite match up with their breakthrough release; 1997&#x27;s &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;. On this effort, Incubus seems more concerned with playing with sounds and differentiating themselves from Kid Rock than they do with making enjoyable music.&quot; 

Kevin Stewart-Panko of Canadian publication &quot;Exclaim!&quot; gave &quot;Make Yourself&quot; a positive review in December 1999, writing &quot;Incubus is simply an awesome band. They have the distorted guitars, but they also have finger wagging melodies, an actual singer and dance floor elements. It’s similar stuff that plagued Faith No More about ten years ago, and Incubus has a noticeable FNM influence, especially Brandon Boyd&#x27;s voice, which eerily recalls a youthful Mike Patton.&quot; In their November 1999 review, &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; also compared the album&#x27;s vocals to Faith No More, and described the instrumentation as being a cross between the funk style of Primus and the &quot;bloody new metal riffs&quot; of Korn. They added that it is a &quot;step away from the spastic, funkdafied metal of 1997&#x27;s brilliant &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; [but] definitely not a step down in quality.&quot; &quot;Adweek&quot; stated in April 2000 that Incubus had &quot;finally made a mark&quot;, and that &quot;their newest offering blends alternative metal with a little rap/rock thrown in for good measure.&quot; &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; had a negative view of the band&#x27;s new sound, giving the album only one out of five stars in October 1999. The review states that, &quot;the group&#x27;s once potent mix of funk, metal, hip-hop, soul and R&amp;B was initially compared to &#x27;Primus with a soul singer&#x27; and a &#x27;90s Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27;. With the bland, radio friendly offering &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, it looks like Incubus is more likely to get compared to the likes of The Goo Goo Dolls and Sugar Ray.&quot; In December 1999, &quot;Daily Eastern News&quot; writer Al Dertz criticized the album for having less slap bass playing from Alex Katunich, adding that Incubus &quot;once had equal influences of Faith No More, Primus and Rage Against the Machine brilliance&quot; and have now &quot;fallen into 311 mediocrity.&quot;

&quot;Make Yourself&quot; was also met with a mixed reaction from some fans of the band, due to its different sound. In a June 2000 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Brandon Boyd claimed, &quot;when the album first came out, we got threatening letters from fans like &#x27;You Sold Out&#x27;.&quot;

===Legacy and accolades===
The album is listed in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Colin Larkin wrote in his 2011 book &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; that &quot;Make Yourself&quot; was &quot;a far slicker affair than previous outings&quot;, adding that it &quot;utilized the latest studio technology and a greater range of sounds.&quot; In 2019, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; included it on a list titled &quot;50 Rock and Metal Bands Whose Third Album Was Their Best&quot;. They wrote, &quot;in ways moving away from their roots and definitively getting more anthemic and catchier with it, &quot;Make Yourself&quot; caught Incubus in a state of flux, but one in which they really found their feet. A little nu metal, a little alternative metal, a little funk, but altogether compelling.&quot; &quot;Loudwire&quot; praised it in 2019, stating that &quot;while at first the album appears to be more of a mainstream break for the band, with &quot;Make Yourself&quot; they’ve managed to find a smoother way to incorporate hip-hop and funk more consistently into their brand of alternative metal&quot;, adding &quot;it may not be the most heavy on the nu-metal sound because of this, but it allowed the mainstream to get a taste of something they may otherwise not have been looking for.&quot;

PopMatters included it on their 2020 list of &quot;The Most Memorable Albums of 1999&quot;, with writer Theresa Dougherty remarking that they &quot;became one of the first bands played on modern rock radio to effectively integrate a DJ into their sound.&quot; In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine. In a 2022 &quot;Louder Sound&quot; article, Brandon Boyd placed it fourth in his ranking of their studio albums. He stated, &quot;It&#x27;s not higher because it was a period of time that was gruelling. We were playing 9 or 10 shows a week: one in the morning and one in the evening, I learned to take naps on drum risers during soundchecks.&quot; Boyd also reflected in 2020 that, &quot;all of the flags were blowing in a direction that was telling us we should’ve made another record like &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; and that would’ve solidified our place in a small subgenre of rock and metal&quot;, adding &quot;our intuitions were pulling us in a completely different direction and we trusted it. We ended up carving our own place in the world.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; placed it third in their ranking of the band&#x27;s studio albums.

==Live performance==
The first known performance of a &quot;Make Yourself&quot; song was at a March 4, 1999 concert at the Glass House in Pomona, California, which featured the live debut of &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;. All of the other songs from &quot;Make Yourself&quot; were performed live during the touring cycle in 1999 and 2000, with the exception of &quot;Battlestar Scralatchtica&quot;, which is not known to have been performed until 2001 during the &quot;Morning View&quot; touring cycle. The band went on a tour of North America in 2019 to celebrate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. In a 2019 interview, DJ Chris Kilmore stated, &quot;for me personally, I actually really enjoy revisiting &quot;Make Yourself&quot; because my role in the band has expanded greatly into playing all kinds of keyboards and things like that. But when we were on &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, I just had two turntables. So I really get to showcase what I originally did in this band, which is really fun for me.&quot;

<doc id="101730" wikidata="Q233289" url="?curid=101730" title="Atal Bihari Vajpayee">
<text>Atal Bihari Vajpayee (25 December 1924 – 16 August 2018) was an Indian politician, poet, and statesman who served as the prime minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. He was the first non-Congress prime minister to serve a full term in the office. Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He was also a Hindi poet and a writer.

He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the Lok Sabha, the lower house, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the Member of Parliament from Lucknow, Gwalior, New Delhi and Balrampur constituencies, before retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health concerns. He was among the founding members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), of which he was president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party, which won the 1977 general election. In March 1977, Vajpayee became the minister of external affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after. Former members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh formed the BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee as its first president.

During his tenure as prime minister, India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. Vajpayee sought to improve diplomatic relations with Pakistan, travelling to Lahore by bus to meet with Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. After the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, he sought to restore relations through engagement with President Pervez Musharraf, inviting him to India for a summit at Agra. Vajpayee&#x27;s government introduced many domestic economic and infrastructural reforms, including encouraging the private sector and foreign investments, reducing governmental waste, encouraging research and development, and the privatisation of some government owned corporations. During his tenure, India&#x27;s security was threatened by a number of violent incidents including 2001 Indian Parliament attack and 2002 Gujarat riots which ultimately caused his defeat in 2004 general election.

== Early life and education ==
Vajpayee was born into a Kanyakubja Brahmin family on 25 December 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. His mother was Krishna Devi and his father was Krishna Bihari Vajpayee. His father was a school teacher in Gwalior. His grandfather, Shyam Lal Vajpayee, had migrated to Morena, Madhya Pradesh from Bateshwar Uttar Pradesh. Later he shifted to Gwalior from Morena for better opportunities.

Vajpayee did his primary schooling at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir, Gwalior and high school education from the Gorkhi School, Gwalior. He subsequently attended Gwalior&#x27;s Victoria College, (now Maharani Laxmi Bai Govt. College of Excellence) where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Hindi, English and Sanskrit. Later for master&#x27;s degree the Scindia dynasty of erstwhile Gwalior state sanctioned him monthly scholarship of Rs 75 and with this scholarship support he completed his post-graduation with a Master of Arts in political science from DAV College, Kanpur, Agra University.

== Early works as activist ==

His activism started in Gwalior with Arya Kumar Sabha, the youth wing of the Arya Samaj movement, of which he became the general secretary in 1944. He also joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1939 as a &quot;swayamsevak&quot;, or volunteer in Gwalior at the age of 12 years. Influenced by Babasaheb Apte, he attended the Officers Training Camp of the RSS during 1940 to 1944, becoming a &quot;pracharak&quot; (RSS terminology for a full-time worker) in 1947. He gave up studying law due to the partition riots. He was sent to Uttar Pradesh as a &quot;vistarak&quot; (a probationary &quot;pracharak&quot;) and soon began working for the newspapers of Deendayal Upadhyaya: &quot;Rashtradharma&quot; (a Hindi monthly), &quot;Panchjanya&quot; (a Hindi weekly), and the dailies &quot;Swadesh&quot; and &quot;Veer Arjun&quot;.

By 1942, at the age of 16 years, Vajpayee became an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and joined it shakha in Gwalior along with his elder brother. Although the RSS had chosen not to participate in the Quit India Movement, in August 1942, Vajpayee and his elder brother Prem were arrested for 24 days during the Quit India Movement. He was released after giving a written statement that while he was a part of the crowd, he did not participate in the militant events in Bateshwar on 27 August 1942. Throughout his life, including after he became prime minister, Vajpayee has labelled the allegation of participation in the Quit India Movement to be a false rumour.

== Early political career (1947–1975) ==

In 1951, Vajpayee was seconded by the RSS, along with Deendayal Upadhyaya, to work for the newly formed Bharatiya Jana Sangh, a Hindu right-wing political party associated with the RSS. He was appointed as a national secretary of the party in charge of the Northern region, based in Delhi. He soon became a follower and aide of party leader Syama Prasad Mukherjee. In the 1957 Indian general election, Vajpayee contested elections to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. He lost to Raja Mahendra Pratap in Mathura, but was elected from Balrampur.

He was influenced by Jawaharlal Nehru to the extent that he mirrored his style, diction, and tone of his speeches. Nehru&#x27;s influence was also evident in Vajpayee&#x27;s leadership. In the Lok Sabha his oratorial skills so impressed Prime Minister Nehru that he predicted that Vajpayee would someday become the prime minister of India. On the occasion of Nehru&#x27;s death on 27 May 1964, Vajpayee termed him as &quot;the orchestrator of the impossible and inconceivable&quot; and likened him to Hindu god Rama.

Vajpayee&#x27;s oratorial skills won him the reputation of being the most eloquent defender of the Jana Sangh&#x27;s policies. After the death of Upadhyaya, the leadership of the Jana Sangh passed to Vajpayee. He became the national president of the Jana Sangh in 1968, running the party along with Nanaji Deshmukh, Balraj Madhok and L. K. Advani.

== Janata Party and the BJP (1975–1995) ==
Vajpayee was arrested along with several other opposition leaders during the Internal Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975. Initially interned in Bangalore, Vajpayee appealed his imprisonment on the grounds of bad health, and was moved to a hospital in Delhi. In December 1976, Vajpayee ordered the student activists of the ABVP to tender an unconditional apology to Indira Gandhi for perpetrating violence and disorder. The ABVP student leaders refused to obey his order.

Gandhi ended the state of emergency in 1977. A coalition of parties, including the BJS, came together to form the Janata Party, which won the 1977 general elections. Morarji Desai, the chosen leader of the alliance, became the prime minister. Vajpayee served as the minister of external affairs, or foreign minister, in Desai&#x27;s cabinet. As foreign minister, Vajpayee became the first person in 1977 to deliver a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in Hindi.
In 1979, Desai and Vajpayee resigned, triggering the collapse of the Janata Party. The erstwhile members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh came together to form the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980, with Vajpayee as its first President.

Leading up to Operation Bluestar, there were several protests by Sangh Parivar, including a march led by LK Advani and Vajpayee of the Bhartiya Janta Party to protest against the lack of government action and to demand that the Indian Army be sent into the Golden Temple.

The 1984 general elections were held in the wake of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s assassination by her Sikh bodyguards. While he had won the 1977 and the 1980 elections from New Delhi, Vajpayee shifted to his home town Gwalior for the election.

Vidya Razdan was initially tipped to be the Congress candidate. Instead, Madhavrao Scindia, scion of the Gwalior royal family, was brought in on the last day of filing nominations. Vajpayee lost to Scindia, managing to secure only 29% of the votes.

Under Vajpayee, the BJP moderated the Hindu-nationalist position of the Jana Sangh, emphasising its connection to the Janata Party and expressing support for Gandhian Socialism. The ideological shift did not bring it success and Indira Gandhi&#x27;s assassination generated sympathy for the Congress, leading to a massive victory at the polls. The BJP won only two seats in parliament. Vajpayee offered to quit as party president following BJP&#x27;s dismal performance in the election, but stayed in the post until 1986. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1986 from Madhya Pradesh, and was briefly the leader of the BJP in Parliament.

In 1986, L. K. Advani took office as president of the BJP. Under him, the BJP returned to a policy of hardline Hindu nationalism. It became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Movement, which sought to build a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama in Ayodhya. The temple would be built at a site believed to be the birthplace of Rama after demolishing a 16th-century mosque, called the Babri Masjid, which then stood there. The strategy paid off for the BJP; it won 86 seats in the Lok Sabha in the 1989 general election, making its support crucial to the government of V. P. Singh. In December 1992, a group of religious volunteers led by members of the BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), tore down the mosque.

He served as Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, for various terms starting at Balrampur from 19571962. He served again from Balrampur from 19671971, then from Gwalior from 19711977, and then from New Delhi from 19771984. Finally, he served from Lucknow from 19912009.

== Prime minister (1996 and 1998–99) ==
=== First term: May 1996 ===

During a BJP conference in Mumbai in November 1995, BJP President Advani declared that Vajpayee would be the party&#x27;s prime ministerial candidate in the forthcoming elections. Vajpayee himself was reported to be unhappy with the announcement, responding by saying that the party needed to win the election first. The BJP became the single largest party in Parliament in the 1996 general election, helped by religious polarisation across the country as a result of the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma invited Vajpayee to form the government. Vajpayee was sworn in as the 10th prime minister of India, but the BJP failed to muster a majority among members of the Lok Sabha. Vajpayee resigned after 16 days, when it became clear that he did not have enough support to form a government. In this short period, he also created and administered the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.

=== Second term: 1998–1999 ===

After the fall of the two United Front governments between 1996 and 1998, the Lok Sabha was dissolved and fresh elections were held. The 1998 general elections again put the BJP ahead of others. A number of political parties joined the BJP to form the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and Vajpayee was sworn in as the prime minister. The coalition was an uneasy one, as apart from the Shiv Sena, none of the other parties espoused the BJP&#x27;s Hindu-nationalist ideology. Vajpayee has been credited for managing this coalition successfully, while facing ideological pressure from the hardline wing of the party and from the RSS. Vajpayee&#x27;s government lasted 13 months until mid-1999 when the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) under J. Jayalalithaa withdrew its support. The government lost the ensuing vote of confidence motion in the Lok Sabha by a single vote on 17 April 1999. As the opposition was unable to come up with the numbers to form the new government, the Lok Sabha was again dissolved and fresh elections were held.

==== Nuclear tests ====

In May 1998, India conducted five underground nuclear tests in the Pokhran desert in Rajasthan, 24 years after its first nuclear test, operation Smiling Buddha in 1974. Two weeks later, Pakistan responded with its own nuclear tests making it the newest nation with declared nuclear capability. While some nations, such as France, endorsed India&#x27;s right to defensive nuclear power, others including the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain and the European Union imposed sanctions on information, resources and technology to India. In spite of intense international criticism and steady decline in foreign investment and trade, the nuclear tests were popular domestically. In effect, the international sanctions imposed failed to sway India from weaponising its nuclear capability. US sanctions against India and Pakistan were eventually lifted after just six months.

==== Lahore summit ====
In late 1998 and early 1999, Vajpayee began a push for a full-scale diplomatic peace process with Pakistan. With the historic inauguration of the Delhi-Lahore bus service in February 1999, Vajpayee initiated a new peace process aimed towards permanently resolving the Kashmir dispute and other conflicts with Pakistan. The resultant Lahore Declaration espoused a commitment to dialogue, expanded trade relations and mutual friendship and envisaged a goal of denuclearised South Asia. This eased the tension created by the 1998 nuclear tests, not only within the two nations but also in South Asia and the rest of the world.

==== AIADMK&#x27;s withdrawal from coalition ====
The AIADMK had continually threatened to withdraw from the coalition and national leaders repeatedly flew down from Delhi to Chennai to pacify the AIADMK general secretary J. Jayalalithaa. However, in May 1999, the AIADMK withdrew from NDA, and the Vajpayee administration was reduced to a caretaker status pending fresh elections scheduled for October 1999.

==== Kargil War ====

In May 1999 some Kashmiri shepherds discovered the presence of militants and non-uniformed Pakistani soldiers (many with official identifications and Pakistan Army&#x27;s custom weaponry) in the Kashmir Valley, where they had taken control of border hilltops and unmanned border posts. The incursion was centred around the town of Kargil, but also included the Batalik and Akhnoor sectors and artillery exchanges at the Siachen Glacier.

The Indian army responded with Operation Vijay, which launched on 26 May 1999. This saw the Indian military fighting thousands of militants and soldiers in the midst of heavy artillery shelling and while facing extremely cold weather, snow and treacherous terrain at the high altitude. Over 500 Indian soldiers were killed in the three-month-long Kargil War, and it is estimated around 600–4,000 Pakistani militants and soldiers died as well. India pushed back the Pakistani militants and Northern Light Infantry soldiers. Almost 70% of the territory was recaptured by India. Vajpayee sent a &quot;secret letter&quot; to U.S. President Bill Clinton that if Pakistani infiltrators did not withdraw from the Indian territory, &quot;we will get them out, one way or the other&quot;.

After Pakistan suffered heavy losses, and with both the United States and China refusing to condone the incursion or threaten India to stop its military operations, General Pervez Musharraf was recalcitrant and Nawaz Sharif asked the remaining militants to stop and withdraw to positions along the LoC. The militants were not willing to accept orders from Sharif but the NLI soldiers withdrew. The militants were killed by the Indian army or forced to withdraw in skirmishes which continued even after the announcement of withdrawal by Pakistan.

== Prime Minister (1999–2004) ==
=== 1999–2002 ===
The 1999 general elections were held in the aftermath of the Kargil operations. The BJP-led NDA won 303 seats out of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, securing a comfortable and stable majority. On 13 October 1999, Vajpayee took oath as the prime minister of India for the third time.

A national crisis emerged in December 1999, when Indian Airlines flight IC 814 from Kathmandu to New Delhi was hijacked by five terrorists and flown to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The hijackers made several demands including the release of certain terrorists like Masood Azhar from prison. Under pressure, the government ultimately caved in. Jaswant Singh, the then minister of external affairs, flew with the terrorists to Afghanistan and exchanged them for the passengers.


In March 2000, Bill Clinton, the President of the United States, paid a state visit to India. This was the first state visit to India by a U.S. president in 22 years, since President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s visit in 1978. President Clinton&#x27;s visit was hailed as a significant milestone in relations between the two nations. Vajpayee and Clinton had wide-ranging discussions on bilateral, regional and international developments. The visit led to expansion in trade and economic ties between India and the United States. A vision document on the future course of Indo-U.S. relations was signed during the visit.

Domestically, the BJP-led government was influenced by the RSS, but owing to its dependence on coalition support, it was impossible for the BJP to push items like building the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya, repealing Article 370 which gave a special status to the state of Kashmir, or enacting a uniform civil code applicable to adherents of all religions. On 17 January 2000, there were reports of the RSS and some BJP hard-liners threatening to restart the Jan Sangh, the precursor to the BJP, because of their discontent over Vajpayee&#x27;s rule. Former president of the Jan Sangh Balraj Madhok had written a letter to the then-RSS chief Rajendra Singh for support. The BJP was, however, accused of &quot;saffronising&quot; the official state education curriculum and apparatus, saffron being the colour of the RSS flag of the RSS, and a symbol of the Hindu nationalism movement. Home Minister L. K. Advani and the Human Resource Development Minister (now called Education Minister) Murli Manohar Joshi were indicted in the 1992 Babri Mosque demolition case for inciting a mob of activists. Vajpayee himself came under public scrutiny owing to his controversial speech one day prior to the mosque demolition.

These years were accompanied by infighting in the administration and confusion regarding the direction of government. Vajpayee&#x27;s weakening health was also a subject of public interest, and he underwent a major knee-replacement surgery at the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai to relieve intense pressure upon his legs.

In March 2001, the Tehelka group released a sting operation video named Operation West End which showed BJP president Bangaru Laxman, senior army officers and NDA members accepting bribes from journalists posing as agents and businessmen. The Defence Minister George Fernandes was forced to resign following the Barak Missile scandal involving the botched supplies of coffins for the soldiers killed in Kargil, and the findings of an inquiry commission that the government could have prevented the Kargil invasion.

Vajpayee initiated talks with Pakistan and invited Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf to Agra for a joint summit. President Musharraf was believed to be the principal architect of the Kargil War in India. By accepting him as the President of Pakistan, Vajpayee chose to move forward leaving behind the Kargil War. But after three days of much fanfare, which included Musharraf visiting his birthplace in Delhi, the summit failed to achieve a breakthrough as President Musharraf declined to leave aside the issue of Kashmir.

=== 2001 attack on Parliament ===

On 13 December 2001, a group of masked, armed men with fake IDs stormed Parliament House in Delhi. The terrorists managed to kill several security guards, but the building was sealed off swiftly and security forces cornered and killed the men who were later proven to be Pakistan nationals. Vajpayee ordered Indian troops to mobilise for war, leading to an estimated 500,000 to 750,000 Indian soldiers positioned along the international border between India and Pakistan under Operation Parakram. Pakistan responded by mobilising its own troops along the border leading to the 2001-2002 military standoff. A terrorist attack on an army garrison in Kashmir in May 2002 further escalated the situation. As the threat of war between two nuclear capable countries and the consequent possibility of a nuclear exchange loomed large, international diplomatic mediation focused on defusing the situation. In October 2002, both India and Pakistan announced that they would withdraw their troops from the border.

The Vajpayee administration brought in the Prevention of Terrorism Act in 2002. The act was aimed at curbing terrorist threats by strengthening powers of government authorities to investigate and act against suspects. It was passed in a joint session of the parliament, amidst concerns that the law would be misused.

Another political disaster hit his government between December 2001 and March 2002 with the VHP and the Government engaging in a major standoff in Ayodhya over the Ram temple. On the 10th anniversary of the destruction of the Babri mosque, the VHP wanted to perform a &quot;shila daan&quot;, or a ceremony laying the foundation stone of the cherished temple at the disputed site. Thousands of VHP activists amassed and threatened to overrun the site and forcibly perform the ceremony. A threat of communal violence and breakdown of law and order owing to the defiance of the government by a religious organisation hung over the nation. The incident, however, ended peacefully with a symbolic handover of a stone at a different location 1 km away from the disputed site.

=== 2002 Gujarat violence ===
In February 2002, a train filled with Hindu pilgrims returning to Gujarat from Ayodhya stopped in the town of Godhra. A scuffle broke out between Hindu activists and Muslim residents, and the train was set on fire, leading to the deaths of 59 people. The charred bodies of the victims were displayed in public in the city of Ahmedabad, and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a statewide strike in Gujarat. These decisions stoked anti-Muslim sentiments. Blaming Muslims for the deaths, rampaging Hindu mobs killed thousands of Muslim men and women, destroying Muslim homes and places of worship. The violence raged for more than two months, and more than 1,000 people died. Gujarat was being ruled by a BJP government, with Narendra Modi as the chief minister. The state government was criticised for mishandling the situation. It was accused of doing little to stop the violence, and even being complicit in encouraging it.

Vajpayee reportedly wanted to remove Modi but was eventually prevailed upon by party members to not act against him. He travelled to Gujarat, visiting Godhra, and Ahmedabad, the site of the most violent riots. He announced financial aid for victims and urged an end to the violence. While he condemned the violence, he did not chastise Modi directly in public. When asked as to what his message to the chief minister in the event of the riots would be, Vajpayee responded that Modi must follow &quot;raj dharma&quot;, Hindi for ethical governance.

At the meeting of the BJP national executive in Goa in April 2002, Vajpayee&#x27;s speech generated controversy for its contents which included him saying: &quot;Wherever Muslims live, they don&#x27;t like to live in co-existence with others.&quot; The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office stated that these remarks had been taken out of context. Vajpayee was accused of doing nothing to stop the violence, and later admitted mistakes in handling the events. K. R. Narayanan, then president of India, also blamed Vajpayee&#x27;s government for failing to quell the violence. After the BJP&#x27;s defeat in the 2004 general elections, Vajpayee admitted that not removing Modi had been a mistake.

=== 2002–2004 ===

In late 2002 and 2003 the government pushed through economic reforms. The country&#x27;s GDP growth exceeded 7% every year from 2003 to 2007, following three years of sub-5% growth. Increasing foreign investment, modernisation of public and industrial infrastructure, the creation of jobs, a rising high-tech and IT industry and urban modernisation and expansion improved the nation&#x27;s international image. Good crop harvests and strong industrial expansion also helped the economy.

In May 2003, he announced before the parliament that he would make one last effort to achieve peace with Pakistan. The announcement ended a period of 16 months, following the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament, during which India had severed diplomatic ties with Pakistan. Although diplomatic relations did not pick up immediately, visits were exchanged by high-level officials and the military standoff ended. The Pakistani President and Pakistani politicians, civil and religious leaders hailed this initiative as did the leaders of the United States, Europe and much of the world. In July 2003, Prime Minister Vajpayee visited China and met with various Chinese leaders. He recognised Tibet as a part of China, which was welcomed by the Chinese leadership, and which, in the following year, recognised Sikkim as part of India. China–India relations improved greatly in the following years.

=== Policies ===
Vajpayee&#x27;s government introduced many domestic economic and infrastructural reforms, including encouraging the private sector and foreign investments, reducing governmental waste, encouraging research and development and privatisation of some government owned corporations. Among Vajpayee&#x27;s projects were the National Highways Development Project and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. In 2001, the Vajpayee government launched the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan campaign, aimed at improving the quality of education in primary and secondary schools.

== 2004 general election ==

In 2003, news reports suggested a tussle within the BJP with regard to sharing of leadership between Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani. BJP president Venkaiah Naidu had suggested that Advani must lead the party politically at the 2004 general elections, referring to Vajpayee as &quot;vikas purush&quot;, Hindi for development man, and Advani as &quot;loh purush&quot;, iron man. When Vajpayee subsequently threatened retirement, Naidu backtracked, announcing that the party would contest the elections under the twin leadership of Vajpayee and Advani.

The NDA was widely expected to retain power after the 2004 general election. It announced elections six months ahead of schedule, hoping to capitalise on economic growth, and Vajpayee&#x27;s peace initiative with Pakistan. The 13th Lok Sabha was dissolved before the completion of its term. The BJP hoped to capitalise on a perceived &#x27;feel-good factor&#x27; and BJP&#x27;s recent successes in the Assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Under the &quot;India Shining&quot; campaign, it released ads proclaiming the economic growth of the nation under the government.

However, the BJP could only win 138 seats in the 543-seat parliament, with several prominent cabinet ministers being defeated. The NDA coalition won 185 seats. The Indian National Congress, led by Sonia Gandhi, emerged as the single largest party, winning 145 seats in the election. The Congress and its allies, comprising many smaller parties, formed the United Progressive Alliance, accounting for 220 seats in the parliament. Vajpayee resigned as prime minister. The UPA, with the outside support of communist parties, formed the next government with Manmohan Singh as the prime minister.

== Post-premiership ==

In December 2005, Vajpayee announced his retirement from active politics, declaring that he would not contest in the next general election. In a famous statement at the BJP&#x27;s silver jubilee rally at Mumbai&#x27;s Shivaji Park, Vajpayee announced that &quot;Henceforth, Lal Krishna Advani and Pramod Mahajan will be the Ram-Lakshman [the two godly brothers much revered and worshipped by Hindus of the BJP.&quot;

Vajpayee was referred to as the &quot;Bhishma Pitamah&quot; of Indian politics by former prime minister Manmohan Singh during a speech in the Rajya Sabha, a reference to the character in the Hindu epic Mahabharata who was held in respect by two warring sides.
Vajpayee was hospitalised at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS) for a chest infection and fever on 6 February 2009. He was put on ventilator support as his condition worsened but he eventually recuperated and was later discharged. Unable to participate in the campaign for the 2009 general election due to his poor health, he wrote a letter urging voters to back the BJP. His protege Lalji Tandon was able to retain the Lucknow seat in that election even though the NDA suffered electoral reverses all over the country. It was speculated that Vajpayee&#x27;s non-partisan appeal contributed to Lalji&#x27;s success in Lucknow in contrast to that BJP&#x27;s poor performance elsewhere in Uttar Pradesh.

== Positions held ==

== Personal life ==
Vajpayee remained a bachelor for his entire life. He adopted and raised Namita Bhattacharya as his own child, the daughter of longtime friend Rajkumari Kaul and her husband B. N. Kaul. His adopted family lived with him.

Unlike purist Brahmins who shun meat and alcohol, Vajpayee was known to be fond of whisky and meat. He was a noted poet, writing in Hindi. His published works include &quot;Kaidi Kaviraj Ki Kundalian&quot;, a collection of poems written during the 1975–1977 emergency, and &quot;Amar aag hai&quot;. With regard to his poetry he wrote

&quot;My poetry is a declaration of war, not an exordium to defeat. It is not the defeated soldier&#x27;s drumbeat of despair, but the fighting warrior&#x27;s will to win. It is not the despirited voice of dejection but the stirring shout of victory.&quot; 

==Illness and death==

Vajpayee had a stroke in 2009 which impaired his speech. His health had been a major source of concern; reports said he was reliant on a wheelchair and failed to recognise people. He also had dementia and long-term diabetes. For many years, he had not attended any public engagements and rarely ventured out of the house, except for checkups at the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences.

On 11 June 2018, Vajpayee was admitted to AIIMS in critical condition following a kidney infection. He was officially declared dead there at 5:05 pm IST on 16 August 2018 at the age of 93. Some sources claim that he had died on the previous day. A seven-day state mourning was announced by the central government throughout India. The national flag flew half-mast during this period.

The world&#x27;s longest tunnel, Atal Tunnel at Rohtang, Himachal Pradesh, on the Leh-Manali Highway was named after Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The third longest cable-stayed bridge in India over the Mandovi River, Atal Setu was named in his memory. The Government of Chhattisgarh changed the name of Naya Raipur to Atal Nagar.

== In popular culture ==
The Films Division of India has produced the short documentary films &quot;Pride of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee&quot; (1998) and &quot;Know Your Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee&quot; (2003), both directed by Girish Vaidya, which explore different facets of his personality. Vajpayee also appears in a cameo in the 1977 Indian Hindi-language film &quot;Chala Murari Hero Banne&quot; by Asrani.

&quot;Aap Ki Adalat&quot;, an Indian talk show which airs on India TV, featured an interview with Vajpayee just before the 1999 elections. &quot;Pradhanmantri&quot; (), a 2013 Indian documentary television series which aired on ABP News and covers the various policies and political tenures of Indian PMs, includes the tenureship of Vajpayee in the episodes &quot;Atal Bihari Vajpayee&#x27;s 13 days government and India during 1996–98&quot;, &quot;Pokhran-II and Kargil War&quot;, and &quot;2002 Gujarat Riots and Fall of Vajpayee Government&quot;.

In 2019, Shiva Sharma and Zeeshan Ahmad, owners of Amaash Films, acquired the official rights of the book &quot;The Untold Vajpayee written&quot; by Ullekh N P, to make a biopic based on Vajpayee&#x27;s life from his childhood, college life and finally turning into a politician.

Hindi-language film &quot;Main Atal Hoon&quot;, starring Pankaj Tripathi as Vajpayee, was theatrically released in India on 19 January 2024.

<doc id="101731" wikidata="Q235454" url="?curid=101731" title="K. R. Narayanan">
<text>Kocheril Raman &quot;K. R.&quot; Narayanan ([kot͡ʃeɾɪl ɾəməɳ nɑɾɑjəɳən]) 27 October 1920 – 9 November 2005) was an Indian statesman, diplomat, academic, and politician who served as the vice president of India from 1992 to 1997 and president of India from 1997 to 2002.

Narayanan was born in Perumthanam, Uzhavoor village, in the princely state of Travancore (present day Kottayam district, Kerala) into a Hindu family. After a brief stint with journalism and then studies at the London School of Economics with the assistance of a scholarship, Narayanan began his career in India as a member of the Indian Foreign Service in the Nehru administration. He served as ambassador to a number of countries, most principally to the United States and China, and was referred by Nehru as &quot;the best diplomat of the country&quot;. He entered politics at Indira Gandhi&#x27;s request and won three successive general elections to the Lok Sabha and served as a Minister of State in prime minister Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s cabinet. Elected as vice president in 1992, Narayanan went on to become president in 1997 and became the first Dalit to occupy either position.

Narayanan is regarded as an independent and assertive president who set several precedents and enlarged the scope of India&#x27;s highest constitutional office. He described himself as a &quot;working president&quot; who worked &quot;within the four corners of the Constitution&quot;; something midway between an &quot;executive president&quot; who has direct power and a &quot;rubber-stamp president&quot; who endorses government decisions without question or deliberation. He used his discretionary powers as a president and deviated from convention and precedent in many situations, including – but not limited to – the appointment of the prime minister in a hung Parliament, in dismissing a state government and imposing President&#x27;s rule there at the suggestion of the Union Cabinet, and during the Kargil conflict. He presided over the golden jubilee celebrations of Indian independence and in the country&#x27;s general election of 1998, he became the first Indian president to vote when in office, setting another new precedent. As of 2023, he remains the last Indian to have been elected president, while serving as vice president.

==Early life==
K. R. Narayanan was born at Perumthanam, Uzhavoor, as the fourth of seven children of Paappiyamma (of the Punnaththuraveettil house) and Kocheril Raman Vaidyarof the Kocheril house and a practitioner of the traditional Indian medical system of Ayurveda. His siblings were Vasudevan, Neelakandan, Gowri, Bhaskaran, Bhargavi and Bharathi. His family, belonging to the Paravar caste (whose members are involved in fishery, boat-building, sea trade), was poor, but his father was respected for his medical acumen.

Narayanan had his early schooling in Uzhavoor at the Government Lower Primary School, Kurichithanam (where he enrolled on 5 May 1927) and Our Lady of Lourdes Upper Primary School, Uzhavoor (1931–35). He walked to school for about 15 kilometres daily through paddy fields, and was often unable to pay the modest fees. He often listened to school lessons while standing outside the classroom, having been barred from attending because tuition fees were outstanding. The family lacked money to buy books and his elder brother K. R. Neelakantan, who was confined to home as he was suffering from asthma, used to borrow books from other students, copy them down, and give them to Narayanan. He matriculated from St. Mary&#x27;s High School, Kuravilangad (1936–37) (he had studied at St. John&#x27;s High School, Koothattukulam (1935–36) previously). He completed his intermediate at C. M. S. College, Kottayam (1938–40), aided by a scholarship from the Travancore Royal family.

Narayanan obtained his B. A. (Honors) and M.A. in English literature from the University of Travancore (1940–43) (present day University of Kerala), standing first in the university (thus becoming the first Dalit to obtain this degree with first class in Travancore). With his family facing grave difficulties, he left for Delhi and worked for some time as a journalist with &quot;The Hindu&quot; and &quot;The Times of India&quot; (1944–45). During this time, he once interviewed Mahatma Gandhi in Bombay on his own volition (10 April 1945).

In 1944, Narayanan was awarded a Tata Scholarship of Rs. 16,000 by J. R. D. Tata to read politics, economics and journalism at the London School of Economics and was awarded Bachelor of Science honors in Economics with specialisation in political science from the University of London. At the LSE (1945), he studied political science under Harold Laski; he also attended lectures by Karl Popper, Lionel Robbins, and Friedrich Hayek. During his years in London, he (along with fellow student K. N. Raj) was active in the India League under V. K. Krishna Menon. He was also the London correspondent of the &quot;Social Welfare Weekly&quot; published by K. M. Munshi. At the LSE he shared lodgings with K. N. Raj and Veerasamy Ringadoo (who later became the first president of Mauritius); another close friend was Pierre Trudeau (who later became Prime minister of Canada).

===Diplomat and academician===

When Narayanan returned to India in 1948, Laski gave him a letter of introduction to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how he began his career in the public service:

Shri Krishna 

When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a timeslot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see that it was time for me to leave. So, I said goodbye and as I left the room, I handed over the letter from Laski and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was halfway round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [Nehru] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [Nehru asked:] &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you give this to me earlier?&quot; [and KRN replied:] &quot;Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving.&quot; After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.
In 1949, he joined the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) on Nehru&#x27;s request, and was appointed an attached&#x27; in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on 18 April of that year. He worked as a diplomat in the embassies at Rangoon, Tokyo, London, Canberra, and Hanoi. Narayanan&#x27;s diplomatic career proceeded as follows:
*Second Secretary, Indian Liaison Mission in Tokyo (appointed 19 August 1951)
*Appointment in the IFS confirmed (29 July 1953)
*First Secretary, High Commission of India to the United Kingdom (relinquished 17 December 1957)
*Deputy Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs (relinquished 11 July 1960)
*First Secretary, High Commission of India to Australia, including period as Acting High Commissioner of India, Canberra (relinquished 27 September 1961)
*Consul-General of India (Hanoi), North Vietnam
*Ambassador to Thailand (1967–69)
*Ambassador to Turkey (1973–75)
*Secretary (East), Ministry of External Affairs (relinquished 1 May 1976) 
*Ambassador to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (appointed 1 May 1976)

During his diplomatic career, Narayanan also taught at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE) (1954) and was Jawaharlal Nehru fellow (1970–72). He retired from the IFS in 1978.

After his retirement, Narayanan served as the Vice-Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi from 3 January 1979 – 14 October 1980; he would later describe this experience as the foundation for his public life. Subsequently, he was recalled from retirement to serve as Indian Ambassador to the United States from 1980–84, under the Indira Gandhi administration. Narayanan&#x27;s tenures as Indian ambassador to China, the first such high level Indian diplomatic posting in that country after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and to the US where he helped arrange Ms. Gandhi&#x27;s landmark 1982 visit to Washington during the Reagan presidency helped mend India&#x27;s strained relations with both these countries. Nehru, who had also been the Minister for External Affairs during his 16 years as PM, held that K. R. Narayanan was &quot;the best diplomat of the country.&quot;(1955)

==Family==

While working in Rangoon, Burma (Myanmar), K. R. Narayanan met Ma Tint Tint, whom he later married in Delhi on 8 June 1951. Ma Tint Tint was active in the YWCA and on hearing that Narayanan was a student of Laski, approached him to speak on political freedom before her circle of acquaintances. Their marriage needed a special dispensation from Nehru as per Indian law, because Narayanan was in the IFS and she was a foreigner. Ma Tint Tint adopted the Indian name &quot;Usha&quot; and became an Indian citizen. Usha Narayanan (1923–2008) worked on several social welfare programs for women and children in India and completed her Masters in Social Work from Delhi School of Social Work. She also translated and published several Burmese short stories; a collection of translated stories by Thein Pe Myint, titled &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot;, appeared in 1998. She is the second woman of foreign origin to have become the First Lady. They have two daughters, Chitra Narayanan (Indian ambassador to Switzerland and The Holy See) and Amrita.

==Political initiation==
Narayanan entered politics at the request of Indira Gandhi and won three successive general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1984, 1989 and 1991, as a representative of the Ottapalam constituency in Palakkad, Kerala, on a Congress ticket. He was a Minister of State in the Union cabinet under Rajiv Gandhi, holding the portfolios of Planning (1985), External Affairs (1985–86), and Science and Technology (1986–89). As a Member of Parliament, he resisted international pressure to tighten patent controls in India. He sat in the opposition benches when the Congress was voted out of power during 1989–91. Narayanan was not included in the cabinet when the Congress returned to power in 1991. K. Karunakaran, Congress Chief Minister of Kerala, a political adversary of his, informed him that he was not made a minister because of him being a &quot;Communist fellow-traveller&quot;. He did not, however, respond when Narayanan pointed out that he had defeated Communist candidates (A. K. Balan and Lenin Rajendran, the latter twice) in all three elections.

== Vice Presidency (1992–1997) ==

K. R. Narayanan was elected as the vice-president of India on 21 August 1992, under the presidency of Shankar Dayal Sharma. His name had been proposed initially by V. P. Singh, former prime minister and the then leader of the Janata Dal parliamentary party. The Janata Dal and the parliamentary left parties had jointly declared him as their candidate, and this had later garnered support from the Congress under P. V. Narasimha Rao, leading to a unanimous decision on his election. On his relationship with the Left front, Narayanan later clarified that he was neither a devotee nor a blind opponent of Communism; they had known of his ideological differences, but had supported him as vice-president (and later as president) because of special political circumstances that prevailed in the country. He had benefited from their support, and in turn, their political positions had gained acceptability. When the Babri Masjid was demolished on 6 December 1992, he described the event as the &quot;greatest tragedy India has faced since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi&quot;.

== Presidency (1997–2002) ==
K. R. Narayanan was elected to the presidency of India (17 July 1997) with 95% of the votes in the electoral college, as a result of the presidential poll on 14 July. This is the only presidential election to have been held with a minority government holding power at the centre. T. N. Seshan was the sole opposing candidate, and all major parties save the Shiv Sena supported his candidature., while Seshan alleged that Narayanan had been elected solely for being a Dalit.

He was sworn in as the president of India (25 July 1997) by Chief Justice J. S. Verma in the Central Hall of Parliament. In his inaugural address, he said: 

That the nation has found a consensus for its highest office in some one who has sprung from the grass-roots of our society and grown up in the dust and heat of this sacred land is symbolic of the fact that the concerns of the common man have now moved to the centre stage of our social and political life. It is this larger significance of my election rather than any personal sense of honour that makes me rejoice on this occasion.

;Golden Jubilee of independence

The principal event of the Golden Jubilee of Indian independence was President K. R. Narayanan&#x27;s midnight address to the nation during the special session of Parliament convened on the night of 14 August; in this address, he identified the establishment of a democratic system of government and politics to be the greatest achievement of India since independence. The following morning, Prime Minister I. K. Gujral, addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort, said: When Gandhiji dreamt of India&#x27;s future, he had said that the country will attain the real freedom only on the day when a Dalit would become the President of this country. This is our great fortune that today on the eve of golden jubilee of independence, we have been able to fulfil this dream of Gandhiji. In the person of Shri K. R. Narayanan we have been able to fulfil the dream of Gandhiji. Our President of whom the whole country is proud of, is from a very poor and downtrodden family and today he has endowed the Rashtrapati Bhavan with a new pride and respect. It is a matter of further happiness that the President has a very high place among the intellectuals of this country. This is a feather in the cap of our democracy that the backward sections of the society today are attaining their rightful place in society. All the countrymen today whether they are from minorities, scheduled castes [Dalits], or scheduled tribes [Adivasis] – are working unitedly for the development of the country.

;Participation in the elections
In the general elections of 1998, K. R. Narayanan became the first sitting president to vote (16 February 1998), casting his vote at a polling booth in a school within the Rashtrapati Bhavan complex after standing in a queue like an ordinary citizen. He insisted on casting his vote, despite the departure from precedent being pointed out to him. Narayanan sought to change what was a long-standing practice of Indian presidents not voting during general elections. He also exercised his franchise as president in the 1999 general elections.

;Golden jubilee of the Republic
President K. R. Narayanan&#x27;s address to the nation on the golden jubilee of the Indian Republic (26 January 2000) is considered a landmark: it was the first time a president attempted to analyse, with due concern for growing disparities, the several ways in which the country had failed to provide economic justice to the Indian people, particularly the rural and agrarian population; he also stated that discontent was breeding and frustrations erupting in violence among the deprived sections of society. In his address to Parliament later that day, he praised the work of B. R. Ambedkar on the Indian constitution and cautioned against attempts to change its basic structure, concurring with Ambedkar&#x27;s preference for accountability and responsibility over the stability of the government. He reiterated this in stronger terms in his next Republic day address (2001); on this occasion, he took exception to certain proposals seeking to abridge the franchise, and pointed out the wisdom of reposing faith in the common men and women of India as a whole, rather than in some elite section of society.

In these addresses, he articulated opinions which departed in many ways from certain views of the A. B. Vajpayee government.

===Exercise of presidential discretion===
President Narayanan introduced the important practice of explaining to the nation (by means of Rashtrapati Bhavan communiqués) the thinking that led to the various decisions he took while exercising his discretionary powers; this has led to openness and transparency in the functioning of the president.

;Appointment of the prime minister and dissolution of Parliament
During his presidency, Narayanan dissolved the Lok Sabha twice after determining through consultations across the political spectrum, that no one was in a position to secure the confidence of the house. Congress president Sitaram Kesri withdrew his party&#x27;s support of the I. K. Gujral government and staked his claim to form the government on 28 November 1997. Gujral advised Narayanan of the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. President Narayanan determined that no one would be able to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha and accepted Gujral&#x27;s advice (4 December). In the ensuing general elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the single largest party, leading the largest pre-election coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the coalition leader Vajpayee staked his claim to form the government, though at that point he did not have a majority. Narayanan asked Vajpayee to furnish letters of support to demonstrate the NDA&#x27;s ability to secure a majority. Vajpayee was able to meet this demand after support for the NDA grew, and subsequently he was appointed Prime Minister (15 March 1998) on the condition (which was met) that a vote of confidence be secured within 10 days.

One of the coalition partners supporting the minority government (the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam under J. Jayalalithaa) wrote a letter to the President withdrawing support on 14 April 1999, and Narayanan advised Vajpayee to seek a vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha. This motion was defeated (17 April). Both Vajpayee and the Leader of the Opposition, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, then staked claims to form the government. Narayanan asked the NDA and the Congress party to show proof of support since the loss of the confidence vote. When evidence from neither party was forthcoming, Narayanan informed the Prime Minister that fresh elections seemed to be the only way to resolve the crisis in governance. The Lok Sabha was then dissolved at Vajpayee&#x27;s advice (26 April). (In the ensuing general elections, the NDA secured a majority and Vajpayee was reappointed Prime Minister (11 October 1999) in a straightforward manner.)

In these decisions, President Narayanan set a new precedent concerning the appointment of a prime minister – if no party or pre-election coalition had a majority, then a person would be appointed prime minister only if he was able to convince the president (through letters of support from allied parties) of his ability to secure the confidence of the house. In doing so, he diverged from the actions of his predecessors who had been faced with the task of appointing a prime minister from a hung parliament, Presidents N. Sanjiva Reddy, R. Venkataraman, and Shankar Dayal Sharma: the latter two had followed the practice of inviting the leader of the single largest party or pre-election coalition to form the government without investigating their ability to secure the confidence of the house.

;Imposition of President&#x27;s rule
President Narayanan returned for reconsideration the advices from the Union cabinet to impose President&#x27;s rule in a state, in accordance with Article 356, in two instances: one from the Gujral government (22 October 1997) seeking to dismiss the Kalyan Singh government in Uttar Pradesh, and the other from the Vajpayee government (25 September 1998) seeking to dismiss the Rabri Devi government in Bihar. In both instances, he cited the Supreme court judgement of 1994 on &quot;S. R. Bommai vs. Union of India&quot; and exercised his discretion by, in the former case, returning the matter for reconsideration of the cabinet, which then decided not to move ahead in the matter. However, in the latter case, the cabinet re-advised the same to the president after couple of months, It was then the President&#x27;s rule was imposed in Bihar in February 1999.

;Kargil conflict
A military conflict was developed in Kargil on the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan in May 1999. The Vajpayee government had lost a no-confidence vote in Lok Sabha earlier that year and the opposition failed to form the next government. The Lok Sabha had been dissolved and a caretaker government was in office. This caused a problem with democratic accountability, as every major government decision is expected to be discussed, deliberated and consented by the parliament. Narayanan suggested to Vajpayee that the Rajya Sabha be convened to discuss the conflict, as demanded by several opposition parties (citing the precedent of Nehru convening a parliamentary session on Vajpayee&#x27;s demand during the Sino-Indian war in 1962 ) though there was no precedent of convening the Rajya Sabha in isolation during an interregnum. Further, Narayanan was briefed by the chiefs of the three arms of the Indian Armed Forces on the conduct of the conflict. His Republic day address next year began by paying homage to the soldiers who had died defending the nation.

===Concern for social and economic justice===

President Narayanan in his speeches consistently sought to remind the nation of its duties and obligations towards the Dalits and Adivasis, the minorities, and the poor and downtrodden. He called the nation&#x27;s attention to various recalcitrant social ills and evils, such as atrocities against women and children, caste discrimination and the ingrained attitudes it nurtured, abuse of the environment and public utilities, corruption and lack of accountability in the delivery of public services, religious fundamentalism, advertisement-driven consumerism, and flouting of human rights, and lamented the absence of public concern, political debate, and civic action to address them. Drawing from the experiences of his own home state Kerala, he pointed out that education was at the root of human and economic development. He hoped that the establishment would not fear the awakening of the masses through education, and spoke of the need to have faith in the people.

President Narayanan spoke on various occasions on the condition of the Dalits, Adivasis, and other oppressed sections of society, and the various iniquities they faced (often in defiance of law), such as denial of civic amenities, ostracism, harassment and violence (particularly against women), and displacement by ill-conceived development projects.

He felt that the policy of reservations for the backward sections in education and the public sector had remained unfulfilled due to administrative distortions and narrow interpretations, and needed to be implemented with renewed vigour and sincerity; apprehensive of what he described as a counter-revolution among some privileged sections seeking to reverse progressive policies, he reminded the nation that these benefits were not charity, but had been provided by way of human rights and social justice to sections constituting a large portion of the population and contributing to the economy as landless agricultural labourers and industrial workers. In his 2002 Republic day address, he drew attention to the Bhopal Declaration. on the Dalit and Adivasi agenda for the 21st century and spoke of the necessity of the private sector adopting policies to promote equitable representation of the backward sections in their enterprises. In a governmental note on higher judicial appointments (which leaked to the press; January 1999), he observed that eligible persons from the backward sections were available and that their under-representation or non-representation was not justifiable; K. G. Balakrishnan, a Dalit, was elevated to the Supreme court (8 June 2000), the fourth such instance, and the only one since 1989.

He felt that Ambedkar&#x27;s exhortation to &quot;educate, organise, agitate&quot; continued to be relevant; with the Dalits forming a quarter of the population in a democracy with universal adult franchise, he felt that the ultimate destiny of the backward sections lay in the hands of the backward sections themselves, organised socially and politically.

When the Australian missionary and social worker Graham Staines and his two minor sons were burned alive (22 January 1999), President Narayanan condemned it as a barbarous crime belonging to the world&#x27;s inventory of black deeds.

Towards the end of his presidency, communal riots broke out in Gujarat (February 2002). President Narayanan was deeply pained and anguished, and described it as a grave crisis of the society and the nation; he called it the duty of every Indian to strive to restore peace and thus preserve and strengthen the foundations of the state and the tradition of tolerance. He did not stand the election for a second presidential term due to the lack of support from the ruling government. After the demission of presidential office, he lent his support to alternative globalisation movements like the World Social Forum. After he had left the presidency, and after the Vajpayee government had been voted out of power in the general elections of May 2004, in an interview on the third anniversary of the riots (in February 2005), he said;
There was governmental and administrative support for the communal riots in Gujarat. I gave several letters to Prime Minister Vajpayee in this regard on this issue. I met him personally and talked to him directly. But Vajpayee did not do anything effective.

I requested him to send the army to Gujarat and suppress the riots. The military was sent, but they were not given powers to shoot. If the military was given powers to shoot at the perpetrators of violence, recurrence of tragedies in Gujarat could have been avoided.

However, both the state (the Narendra Modi government) and central government did not do so. I feel there was a conspiracy involving the state and central governments behind the Gujarat riots.

He also stated that constitutional limits on his powers had prevented him from doing anything further.
Throughout his presidency, Narayanan adopted the policy of not visiting places of worship or godmen/godwomen; he is the only president to have followed this practice.

===Demission of office===
As Narayanan&#x27;s tenure neared its end, various sections of public opinion looked forward to a second term of his presidency. The NDA had a slender majority in the electoral college. Narayanan offered to be a consensus candidate. Opposition parties (including the Congress, the Left Front, Janata Dal (Secular), and various regional parties) supported a second term for him, and Sonia Gandhi met him to request his candidature; Vajpayee then met Narayanan, informed him that there was no consensus within the NDA on the question, and advised against his candidature. The NDA then proposed to elevate the vice-president, Krishan Kant, as a consensus; this drew support from the opposition and an agreement to this effect was conveyed by Vajpayee&#x27;s representative to the Congress. However, within a day, the NDA unable to reach an internal consensus, decided to propose another candidate P. C. Alexander. Alexander&#x27;s candidature drew disapproval of the opposition. The opposition parties approached Narayanan and renewed their request to seek a second term. The NDA then put forth a third candidate A P J Abdul Kalam as their official choice, without seeking consensus; one opposition party (the Samajwadi Party under Mulayam Singh Yadav) dissipated the unity of the Opposition by supporting this proposal. Narayanan opted himself out from a contest at this point.

When asked about these events later, Narayanan accused the BJP of scuttling a second term of his presidency.

In his farewell address to the nation (24 July 2002), K. R. Narayanan set his hopes for social action and progress on the service of the nation by its youth. He reflected on his varied experiences of the essential goodness and wisdom of the Indian people, recalling how he had grown up in Uzhavoor among adherents of several religions, how religious tolerance and harmony had prevailed, how upper-caste Hindus and well-off Christians had helped him in his early studies, and how upper-caste Hindus as well as Christians and Muslims had worked together enthusiastically for his election campaigns in Ottapalam. He said that the credibility and endurance of India&#x27;s unity and democracy are founded on its tradition of tolerance, and spoke of the need for Hindus, who form the majority, to express the traditional spirit of their religion.

Reflecting on his presidency, K. R. Narayanan said:
As the President of India, I had lots of experiences that were full of pain and helplessness. There were occasions when I could do nothing for people and for the nation. These experiences have pained me a lot. They have depressed me a lot. I have agonised because of the limitations of power. Power and the helplessness surrounding it are a peculiar tragedy, in fact. 
He was the also the first president addressed the state assembly.

==Subsequent life==

After his retirement as president, K. R. Narayanan, along with his wife Usha, lived his remaining years in a central Delhi bungalow (on 34 Prithviraj Road).

At the World Social Forum (WSF) in Mumbai (21 January 2004), he lent his support to the alternative globalisation movement. Addressing the forum at its concluding session, he praised the WSF for demanding freedom in its most comprehensive form, and was happy that people had assembled under an important idea, rather than for narrow political ends; after reflecting on corporations displacing governments in various countries, and on how Mahatma Gandhi had fought British colonisers non-violently with the strength of the masses, he predicted that vocal masses the world over would successfully fight by non-violent means the capturing of the world&#x27;s resources by a few corporations in the name of globalisation. He urged the people to struggle against power corporates and militarism and fight those aspects of globalisation which were against the interests of the people; he hailed people&#x27;s power as a renascent factor of international politics.

K. R. Narayanan dedicated (15 February 2005) his &quot;tharavaadu&quot; at Uzhavoor to the Santhigiri Ashram in Pothencode for the purpose of establishing the Navajyothisree Karunakara Guru research centre for Siddha and Ayurveda. This turned out to be his last return to Uzhavoor.

K. R. Narayanan died on 9 November 2005 aged 85 at the Army Research and Referral Hospital, New Delhi, after being briefly ill with pneumonia and consequent renal failure. He was cremated with full state honors at sunset the following day, according to Hindu rites, which took place in Karma Bhumi near Rajghat, New Delhi. Every year on his death anniversary respects are paid at this Samadhi. The last rites were performed by his nephew P. V. Ramachandran, at &quot;Ekta sthal&quot; on the banks of the River Yamuna (adjacent to &quot;Shanti van&quot;, the memorial of his mentor Jawaharlal Nehru). Part of the urns containing the ashes were by taken by train to Haridwar where they were immersed in the Ganga by the eldest daughter in the presence of the Hindu pandit who performed the ceremony according to Hindu rites. The second part of the urns were accompanied by the younger daughter and taken to Kerala where the State Government arranged the procession to the Bharthapuzha river, a sacred river of Kerala.

Four siblings, K. R. Gowri, K. R. Bhargavi, K. R. Bharathi, and K. R. Bhaskaran, survived him; two elder brothers had died when Narayanan was in his twenties. His elder sister Gowri (a homoeopath, who remained unmarried) and his younger brother Bhaskaran (a teacher, also unmarried) had been living in Uzhavoor. Villagers of Uzhavoor marched silently to the &quot;tharavaadu&quot; of K. R. Narayanan and paid him reverent homage.

;From the sidelines of society

About his life and its message, K. R. Narayanan said:
I see and understand both the symbolic as well as the substantive elements of my life. Sometimes I visualise it as a journey of an individual from a remote village on the sidelines of society to the hub of social standing. But at the same time I also realise that my life encapsulates the ability of the democratic system to accommodate and empower marginalised sections of society.

== Honours ==

Narayanan received honorary degrees from several universities, including the University of Toledo and National University of San Marcos.

Narayanan also received the 1998 World Statesman Award.

== The K. R. Narayanan Foundation ==

Jose, who is also the General Secretary of the K.R.N.F. The Foundation has planned to distribute DVD copies of the creative work to all schools, colleges and public libraries.

<doc id="101732" wikidata="Q20059942" url="?curid=101732" title="List of The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series) episodes">
<text>The original incarnation of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; anthology series began on October 2, 1959, and ended on June 19, 1964, with five seasons and 156 episodes. It was created by Rod Serling and broadcast on CBS.

Ongoing popularity of the series brought about a 1983 feature film and three &quot;revival&quot; television series in 1985, 2002, and 2019, though none reached the same level of critical and commercial success as the original run.

==Series overview==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Episodes==
===Concept (1958)===
Rod Serling wrote a teleplay intending for it to be the pilot episode of a new series called &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Although it ended up airing on a different show, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, it is considered the seed episode and has even been adapted as one of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; radio-show episodes.

===Pilot (1959)===
The pilot episode for the series was called &quot;Where is Everybody?&quot; The episode was reformatted when included in the series. It differs from the broadcast episode in only minor ways.

===Season 1 (1959–60)===

&quot;Note&quot;: Episode titles were not shown on screen, but were announced by Serling at the end of the preceding week&#x27;s episode. &quot;Where is Everybody?&quot; is an exception, as it was the first episode. Serling&#x27;s promotional announcements were stripped from syndicated versions of season one, but restored (often only in audio form) on the Image Entertainment DVD releases. They have since been fully restored on the Blu-ray releases.
===Season 2 (1960–61)===

Unlike season 1, episode titles were shown on screen during the end credits. 

Six consecutive episodes (production code #173-3662 through #173-3667) of this season were recorded on videotape (not on film as were all other episodes) at CBS Television City, as a cost-cutting measure mandated by CBS programming head James T. Aubrey. They are &quot;The Lateness of the Hour&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Meek&quot;, &quot;The Whole Truth&quot;, &quot;Twenty Two&quot;, &quot;Static&quot;, and &quot;Long Distance Call&quot;. These have a visual appearance which is distinctly different from those of episodes shot on film. In addition, videotape was a relatively primitive medium in the early 1960s; the editing of tape was next to impossible. Each of the episodes was therefore &quot;camera-cut&quot; as in live TV—on a studio sound stage, using a total of four cameras. The requisite multi-camera setup of the videotape experiment made location shooting difficult, severely limiting the potential scope of the storylines, so the short-lived experiment was abandoned.

&quot;A Most Unusual Camera&quot; was produced for season one, but it ended up in season two for unknown reasons.
===Season 3 (1961–62)===

Beginning with this season, episode titles were shown on screen after Serling&#x27;s opening monologues. &quot;The Grave&quot; and &quot;Nothing in the Dark&quot; are the exceptions since they were produced for season two.
===Season 4 (1963)===

For season four, the series was lengthened to one hour and moved to Thursdays at 9:30 pm (Eastern Time), replacing &quot;Fair Exchange&quot; on the schedule.
===Season 5 (1963–64)===

In the fifth and final season, the series went back to a half-hour format, returned to a fall start, and aired Fridays at 9:30 pm (Eastern Time) on CBS.

<doc id="101733" wikidata="Q851440" url="?curid=101733" title="Pay-per-view">
<text>Pay-per-view (PPV) is a type of pay television or webcast service that enables a viewer to pay to watch individual events via private telecast.

Events can be purchased through a multichannel television platform using their electronic program guide, an automated telephone system, or through a live customer service representative. There has been an increasing number of pay-per-views distributed via streaming video online, either alongside or in lieu of carriage through television providers. In 2012, the popular video sharing platform YouTube began to allow partners to host live PPV events on the platform.

Events distributed through PPV typically include boxing, mixed martial arts, professional wrestling, and concerts. In the past, PPV was often used to distribute telecasts of feature films, as well as adult content such as pornographic films, but the growth of digital cable and streaming media caused these uses to be subsumed by video on demand systems (which allow viewers to purchase and view pre-recorded content at any time) instead, leaving PPV to focus primarily on live event programs and combat sports.

==History==
The earliest form of pay-per-view was closed-circuit television, also known as theatre television, where professional boxing telecasts were broadcast live to a select number of venues (mostly theaters, with arenas, stadiums, convention centers, and schools being less common venues), where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live. The first fight with a closed-circuit telecast was Joe Louis vs. Jersey Joe Walcott in 1948. Closed-circuit telecasts peaked in popularity with Muhammad Ali in the 1960s and 1970s, with &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight drawing 50million buys worldwide in 1974, and the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot; drawing 100million buys worldwide in 1975. Closed-circuit television was gradually replaced by pay-per-view home television in the 1980s and 1990s.

=== Experimental PPV systems in the 1950s and 1960s ===
The Zenith Phonevision system became the first home pay-per-view system to be tested in the United States. Developed in 1951, it used telephone lines to take and receive orders, as well as to descramble a television broadcast signal. The field tests conducted for Phonevision lasted for 90 days and were tested in Chicago, [
Illinois. The system used IBM punch cards to descramble a signal broadcast during the broadcast station&#x27;s &quot;off-time&quot;. Both systems showed promise, but the Federal Communications Commission denied them the permits to operate.

Telemeter, an experimental coin-operated pay-per-view service, had a trial run in Los Angeles in 1952 and Palm Springs, California from 1953 to 1954, featuring first-run movies and live sporting events, until a lawsuit from a local drive-in and other issues forced it to shut down. The service then set up an experimental run in the Toronto suburb of Etobicoke, Canada in 1959, free from American antitrust laws and outside of the FCC&#x27;s juridiction. Programming initially consisted essentially of first-run movies and fictional series. In 1961, Telemeter signed deals with the Toronto Argonauts football team and the Toronto Maple Leafs to broadcast away games; wrestling was also featured. Some original programming, such as a 1962 Bob Newhart stand-up comedy special, thought to be the first filmed pay-per-view television special were produced at Telemeter&#x27;s Bloor Street studio and several Broadway shows and an opera performance were also broadcast. At its peak, 5,800 households were subscribed but the experiment was not a success and shut down operations on April 30, 1965 with only 2,500 subscribers.

One of the earliest pay-per-view systems on cable television, the Optical Systems-developed Channel 100, first began service in 1972 in San Diego, California through Mission Cable (which was later acquired by Cox Communications) and TheaterVisioN, which operated out of Sarasota, Florida. These early systems quickly went out of business, as the cable industry adopted satellite technology and as flat-rate pay television services such as Home Box Office (HBO) became popular.

While most pay-per-view services were delivered via cable, there were a few over-the-air pay TV stations that offered pay-per-view broadcasts in addition to regularly scheduled broadcasts of movies and other entertainment. These stations, which operated for a few years in Chicago, Los Angeles and some other cities, broadcast &quot;scrambled&quot; signals that required descrambler devices to convert the signal into standard broadcast format. These services were marketed as ON-TV.

=== Professional boxing during 1960s1970s ===
The first home pay-per-view cable television broadcast was the Floyd Patterson vs. Ingemar Johansson rematch in 1960, when 25,000 TelePrompTer subscribers mailed $2 to watch Patterson regain the heavyweight title. The third PattersonJohansson match in 1961 was later viewed by 100,000 paid cable subscribers. Muhammad Ali had several fights on early pay-per-view home television, including Cassius Clay vs. Doug Jones in 1963, and Sonny Liston vs. Cassius Clay which drew 250,000 buys on cable television in 1964.

Professional boxing was largely introduced to pay-per-view cable television with the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot; fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in September 1975. The fight sold 500,000 pay-per-view buys on HBO. There was also another major title fight aired on pay-per-view in 1980, when Roberto Durán defeated Sugar Ray Leonard. Cable companies offered the match for $10, and about 155,000 customers paid to watch the fight.

=== 1980s2000s ===
WWE chairman and chief executive officer Vince McMahon is considered by many as one of the icons of pay-per-view promotion. McMahon owns the domain name payperview.com, which redirects to the WWE Network website.

With the rise of direct broadcast satellite services in the 1990s, this meant more services exclusively for DBS users appeared. DirecTV had &quot;Direct Ticket&quot; (which, in addition to movies and special events, also included PPV sports packages, most notably NFL Sunday Ticket), while Dish Network had &quot;Dish On Demand&quot;. PrimeStar, on the other hand, utilized pre-existing services like Viewer&#x27;s Choice and Request TV (as it was owned by a number of major cable providers), though promotional material bannered all PPV services under the name of &quot;PrimeCinema&quot;.

=== HBO PPV (professional boxing) ===
In 2006, HBO generated 3.7 million pay-per-view buys with $177 million in gross sales. The only year with more buys previously, 1999, had a total of 4 million. The former record fell in 2007 when HBO sold 4.8 million PPV buys with $255 million in sales. BY 2014, HBO had generated 59.3 million buys and $3.1 billion in revenue since its 1991 debut with Evander Holyfield-George Foreman.

1999 differed radically from 2006: 1999 saw four major fight cards: De La Hoya-Trinidad (1.4 million buys), Holyfield-Lewis I (1.2 million), Holyfield-Lewis II (850,000) and De La Hoya-Quartey (570,000). By contrast, only one pay-per-view mega-fight took place in 2006: De La Hoya-Mayorga (925,000 buys). Rahman-Maskaev bombed with under 50,000. The other eight PPV cards that year all fell in the 325,000–450,000 range.

In May 2007, the junior middleweight boxing match between Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr. on HBO PPV became the biggest-selling non-heavyweight title fight, with a little more than 2.5 million buyers. The fight itself generated roughly in domestic PPV revenue, making it the most lucrative prizefight of that era. The record stood until 2015 before it was broken by Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao in a fight dubbed as the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot; on May 2, 2015, which generated 4.6 million ppv buys and a revenue of over $400 million.

The leading PPV attraction, Floyd Mayweather Jr. has generated approximately 24 million buys and $1.6 billion in revenue. Manny Pacquiao, ranked second, has generated approximately 20.1 million buys and $1.2 billion in revenue. Oscar De La Hoya, has &quot;sold&quot; approximately 14 million s in total, giving $700 million in domestic television receipts and stands third. In fourth place in buys, Evander Holyfield has achieved 12.6 million units ($550 million); and at fifth, Mike Tyson has reached 12.4 million units ($545 million).

Ross Greenburg, then president of HBO Sports, called the expansion of pay-per-view &quot;the biggest economic issue in boxing&quot;, stating &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you that pay-per-view helps the sport because it doesn&#x27;t. It hurts the sport because it narrows our audience, but it&#x27;s a fact of life. Every time we try to make an HBO World Championship Boxing fight, we&#x27;re up against mythical pay-per-view numbers. HBO doesn&#x27;t make a lot of money from pay-per-view. There&#x27;s usually a cap on what we can make. But the promoters and fighters insist on pay-per-view because that&#x27;s where their greatest profits lie.&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s a big problem,&quot; Greenburg continues. &quot;It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to put fighters like Manny Pacquiao on HBO World Championship Boxing. If Floyd Mayweather beats Oscar, he might never fight on HBO World Championship Boxing again. But if HBO stopped doing pay-per-view, the promoters would simply do it on their own [like Bob Arum did with Cotto-Malignaggi in June 2006] or find someone else who will do it for them.&quot;

Former HBO Sports President Seth Abraham concurs, saying, &quot;I think, if Lou (DiBella) and I were still at HBO, we&#x27;d be in the same pickle as far as the exodus of fights to pay-per-view is concerned.&quot;

=== Ultimate Fighting Championship ===
The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a mixed martial arts promotion, was a relative newcomer to the PPV market. However, the promotion experienced a surge in popularity in the mid-2000s, credited initially to the popularity of an associated reality show on the cable channel Spike, &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;. UFC 52—the first UFC event since its premiere, broke the promotion&#x27;s record with almost 300,000 buys (in comparison to 250,000 for UFC 5). PPV numbers escalated further in 2006, with its events taking in a gross revenue of $222 million. In October 2016, it was reported that 42% of the UFC&#x27;s &quot;content revenue&quot; in 2015 came from pay-per-view buys, followed by U.S. and international media rights.

In 2018, UFC 229 would pull an all-time record for the promotion, with estimates indicating that the event attracted nearly 2.4 million buys, breaking the 1.65 million buy record set by UFC 202.

In March 2019, as part of a larger contract with ESPN for media rights in the United States, it was announced that future UFC pay-per-views will only be sold to subscribers of the network&#x27;s streaming service ESPN+.

=== Professional wrestling ===
Professional wrestling has a long history of running pay-per-view events. WWE (then WWF) launched its first pay-per-view event in 1985 with its annual flagship event WrestleMania and has run numerous others throughout the years. Although it still offers its events via traditional PPV outlets, they have also been included at no additional charge as part of a larger, subscription-based streaming service known as WWE Network. The service also includes original programming (such as documentary-style series and other wrestling programs) and an on-demand archive of events and television episodes from WWE&#x27;s library. Following WrestleMania 34, the service had 2.12 million subscribers.

Since the beginning of 2022, WWE has used the term &quot;Premium Live Events&quot; instead of pay-per-view to promote their availability via subscription platforms such as WWE Network and other streaming services (such as Peacock), although they still remain available via traditional PPV.

Other major organizations such as World Championship Wrestling, Extreme Championship Wrestling, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, Ring of Honor, and All Elite Wrestling have also run pay-per-view events.

=== Concerts ===
In 1999, Woodstock 1999 was broadcast via PPV from Rome, New York for people who wanted to attend but could not. The cameras were a cause of the downfall of the event.

In 2015, PPV broadcasts of the Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead tour set a record for buys for a music event, with over 400,000.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
Viewers in the United Kingdom and Ireland can access pay-per-view via satellite, cable and over-the-internet television services, mainly for films, boxing, mixed martial arts and American professional wrestling via services such as Sky Box Office and TNT Sports Box Office. Recent years has seen the number of pay-per-view boxing events significantly increase and currently all of the UK&#x27;s top fights are only available via pay-per-view. Broadcasters (most notably PremPlus) have abandoned their aspirations to introduce PPV into other sports markets following poor interest from the public.

In October 2020 during the 2020-21 season, the Premier League experimented with PPV telecasts of football matches not selected for broadcasts by its main rightsholders (which are usually blacked out 3:00 p.m. kickoffs, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, which prevented any attendance of the matches). However, the matches proved unpopular, with team supporters&#x27; groups urging fans to make donations to charity instead, and the Premier League announcing that it would allocate the extra matches among its existing rightsholders (TNT and Sky, as well as Amazon Prime Video and BBC Sport, with some on free-to-air TV) through at least the end of 2020, as it had done during the conclusion of the previous season.

===Canada===
In Canada, most specialty television providers provide pay-per-view programming through one or more services. In all cases, prices typically range from around C$4.99 (for movies) up to $50 or more for special events.

Initially, there were three major PPV providers in Canada; Viewers Choice operated in Eastern Canada as a joint venture of Astral Media, Rogers Communications, and TSN. Western International Communications operated a separate service in the west initially known as Home Theatre; it was later rebranded as Viewers Choice under license.

Viewers Choice Canada was a partner in a French-language PPV service known as Canal Indigo, which is now entirely owned by Videotron. Bell Canada launched a PPV service for its ExpressVu television provider known as Vu! in 1999.

Home Theatre was later acquired by Shaw Communications; after gaining permission to operate nationally, it re-branded as a white-label PPV known internally as Shaw PPV in December 2007. In 2014, due to Bell Media&#x27;s majority ownership of Viewers Choice because of its acquisition of Astral, and because both Bell and Rogers now ran their own in-house PPV operations (Vu! and Sportsnet PPV), Viewers Choice was shut down.

===Mainland Europe===
In Romania, cable communications operator UPC Romania has notified the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) on the intention to introduce in January, February 2014 at the latest, an on-demand audiovisual media service called Agerpres. According to the manager of UPC Romania-owned Smaranda Radoi UPC, will allow customers to watch movies on demand or live events; as well as broadcasts of performances, concerts and sporting events.

While CanalSat holds the rights to live soccer matches for France&#x27;s Ligue 1, TPS had the rights for Boxe matches. In 2007, Multivision service ceased by the end of TPS service which merged with Canalsat. Nowadays, Ciné+ is the only existing pay-per-view service in France.

In Croatia, Fight Channel is broadcasting martial arts events organized by the world&#x27;s most prominent fighting organizations, such as the UFC, K-1, HBO Boxing, Dream, Glory WS, World Series of Boxing etc. and its pay-per-view service covers the Balkans region.

Sky Deutschland, accessible in Germany, Austria and partially in Switzerland, provided nine PPV-Channels called &quot;Sky Select&quot;, where their regular Pay-TV customers can see movies or various sports events such as boxing or soccer.

<doc id="101739" wikidata="Q124739" url="?curid=101739" title="Tijuana">
<text>Tijuana is the most populous city of the Mexican state of Baja California, located on the northwestern Pacific Coast of Mexico. Tijuana is the municipal seat of the Tijuana Municipality, the hub of the Tijuana metropolitan area and the most populous city in northern Mexico. It is just south of California and it has a close proximity to the Mexico–United States border which is part of the San Diego–Tijuana metro area.

Tijuana is the 27th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico. As of 2024, the population of Tijuana has increased to 2,297,000, reflecting a growth of 1.63% since 2023. The city was second-largest nationally with 1,810,645 inhabitants. The international metropolitan region was estimated at 5,158,459 in 2016, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in The Californias, 19th-largest metropolitan area in the Americas, and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico. The city is one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the country and rated as a &quot;High Sufficiency&quot; global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish colonists in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias. Following the division of the Californias after the American Conquest of California, Tijuana found itself located on an international border, giving rise to a new economic and political structure. The city was incorporated on 11 July 1889 as urban development began. The city has served as a major tourist destination since the 1880s. Today, Tijuana is a dominant manufacturing center for North America, hosting facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies. In the early 21st century, Tijuana has emerged as the medical device manufacturing capital of North America and is increasingly recognized as an important cultural Mecca for the border region of The Californias. The city is the most visited border city in the world, sharing a border of about with its sister city San Diego. More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year.

Despite its popularity as a tourist destination, Tijuana is a hotbed of crime, especially violent crime, due to the extensive presence of organized crime and Mexican cartels. It regularly ranks among the most violent cities by homicide rate. According to Statista in August 2023, Tijuana presently has the second highest homicide rate in the world. The U.S. State Department maintains a travel advisory warning as of September 2023 relating to the city&#x27;s &quot;non-tourist areas&quot;. Incidents involving the murder or kidnapping of foreigners since the 2000s have also sparked travel fears and affected Tijuana&#x27;s status among international tourists.

==Name==
The city&#x27;s name comes from the rancho that Santiago Argüello Moraga established in 1829 on his Mexican land grant, naming it &quot;Rancho Tía Juana&quot;.

The first Spanish mission referred to the settlement variously as &quot;Rancho Tía Juana&quot;, &quot;Tihuan&quot; and finally, &quot;Tijuana&quot;. While the city was founded as “Tijuana” in 1889, &quot;Tia Juana&quot; remained the English-language name for the river, as well as a U.S. settlement that is now part of San Ysidro, until approximately 1916.

The commonly accepted theory among historians is that &quot;Tía Juana&quot;, as Argüello named his rancho, is derived from the word (&quot;by the sea&quot;) in the language of the Kumeyaay—the First Nations people of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Urban legend, on the other hand, states that &quot;Tía Juana&quot;, which means &quot;Aunt Jane&quot; in Spanish, was a real person whose inn provided food and lodging to travelers. There is, however, no record of such an inn; in fact, the first building in the area was built by Argüello in any case, after naming his ranch Rancho Tía Juana.

In California, Tijuana is often referred to as &quot;T.J.&quot;

==History==

The land was originally inhabited by the Kumeyaay, a tribe of Yuman-speaking hunter-gatherers. Europeans arrived in 1542, when colonist Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo toured the coastline of the area, which Sebastián Vizcaíno mapped in 1602. In 1769, Juan Crespí documented more details about the area that was later called the Valley of Tijuana.

===19th century===
Further settlement took place near the end of the mission era when José María de Echeandía, governor of the Baja California and Alta California, awarded a large land grant to Santiago Argüello in 1829. This large cattle ranch, Rancho Tía Juana, covered . Although &quot;Tia Juana&quot; means &quot;Aunt Jane&quot; in Spanish, the name was actually an adaptation of the word &#x27;Tihuan&#x27; or &#x27;Tijuán&#x27; in the Kumeyaay language, the name of a nearby Kumeyaay settlement and whose meaning is disputed.

In 1848, as a result of the Mexican–American War with the United States, Mexico lost Alta California. While the majority of the 1,000 Hispanic families living in Alta California stayed on the American side, some moved south to Tijuana to remain inside Mexico, which was now in Baja California as the division between the Californias moved north in between San Diego and Tijuana. Because of this Tijuana gained a different purpose on the international border. The area had been populated by ranchers, but Tijuana developed a new social economic structure which were farming and livestock grazing, plus as a transit area for prospectors.

Urban settlement began in 1889, when descendants of Santiago Argüello and Augustín Olvera entered an agreement to begin developing the city of Tijuana. The date of the agreement, 11 July 1889, is recognized as the founding of the city. Tijuana saw its future in tourism from the beginning. From the late 19th century to the first few decades of the 20th century, the city attracted large numbers of Californians coming for trade and entertainment. The California land boom of the 1880s led to the first big wave of tourists, who were called &quot;excursionists&quot; and came looking for echoes of the famous novel &quot;Ramona&quot; by Helen Hunt Jackson.

===20th century===
In 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries claiming loyalty to Ricardo Flores Magón took over the city for shortly over a month. Federal troops then arrived. Assisted by the &quot;defensores de Tijuana&quot;, they routed the revolutionaries, who fled north and were promptly arrested by the United States Army.

The Panama–California Exposition of 1915 brought many visitors to the nearby California city of San Diego. Tijuana attracted these tourists with a &quot;Feria Típica Mexicana&quot; – Typical Mexican Fair. This included curio shops, regional food, thermal baths, horse racing and boxing.

The first professional race track opened in January 1916, just south of the border gate. It was almost immediately destroyed by the great &quot;Hatfield rainmaker&quot; flood of 1916. Rebuilt in the general area, it ran horse races until the new Agua Caliente track opened in 1929, several miles south and across the river on higher ground.

Legal drinking and gambling attracted U.S. nationals in the 1920s during Prohibition. The Avenida Revolución area became the city&#x27;s tourist center, with casinos and the Hotel Caesar&#x27;s, birthplace of the Caesar salad.

In 1925, the city by presidential decree changed its name to &quot;Ciudad Zaragoza&quot;, but its name reverted to &quot;Tijuana&quot; in 1929.

In 1928, the Agua Caliente Touristic Complex was opened, including hotel, spa, dog-track, private airport, golf course and gambling casino. A year later, the new Agua Caliente Racetrack joined the complex. During the eight years it operated, the Agua Caliente hotel, casino and spa achieved a near mythical status, with Hollywood stars and gangsters flying in and playing. Rita Hayworth was discovered there. Musical nightclub productions were broadcast over the radio. A singer known as &quot;la Faraona&quot; got shot in a love-triangle and gave birth to the myth of a beautiful lady ghost. Remnants of the Agua Caliente casino can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool and the &quot;minarete&quot; (actually a former incinerator chimney) nearby the southern end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada, on the grounds of what is now the Lázaro Cárdenas educational complex. A replica of the iconic bell tower (which once stood at the resort entrance) now stands at the beginning of Boulevard Agua Caliente, about two miles west of the old resort.

In 1935, President Cárdenas decreed an end to gambling and casinos in Baja California, and the Agua Caliente complex faltered, then closed. In 1939, it was reopened as a junior high school (now, Preparatoria Lázaro Cárdenas). The buildings themselves were torn down in the 1970s and replaced by modern scholastic architecture.

With increased tourism and a large number of Mexican citizens relocating to Tijuana, the city&#x27;s population grew from 21,971 to 65,364 between 1940 and 1950. With the decline of nightlife and tourism in the 1950s, the city restructured its tourist industry, by promoting a more family-oriented scene. Tijuana developed a greater variety of attractions and activities to offer its visitors.

In 1965, the Mexican federal government launched the Border Industrialization Program to attract foreign investment. Tijuana and other border cities became attractive for foreign companies to open maquiladoras (factories), and the Tijuana economy started to diversify. Manufacturing jobs attracted workers from other parts of Mexico and the city&#x27;s population grew from less than half a million in 1980 to almost 1 million in 1985.

In 1972, work began on the first concrete channeling of the Tijuana River; previously the river would flood across a wide plain east and southeast of downtown, inundating an area of cardboard and metal shacks called &quot;Cartolandia&quot; (“Paperland”). The project removed the shacks and added 1.8 million sq. m. of usable land, on which the Zona Río was built. With the 1981 opening of the Plaza Río Tijuana mall and the 1982 Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT), Zona Río became the new commercial center of a modern Tijuana, and with its new boulevards with monument-filled &quot;glorietas&quot; (roundabouts), reminiscent of the grand Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, the city created the new image and allure of a modern, large city, rather than just a border town focused on tourism and vice.

In 1994, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana while making an appearance in the plaza of Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood nestled in a valley near Centro. The shooter was caught and imprisoned, but doubts remain about who the mastermind might have been.

===21st century===

After 9/11, tighter US border controls resulted in hours-long waits to return to the US. The number of US visitors dropped sharply due to this factor, as well as subsequent drug violence.

Around 2008, thousands of Tijuana&#x27;s elite bought houses in and moved to Bonita and Eastlake in Chula Vista, California, to escape violence, kidnapping and other crimes taking place during that period. An article in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the emigration to San Diego County has transformed the demographic and cultural character of some cities to a degree.

In recent years, Tijuana has become an important city of commerce and migration for Mexico and US. In spite of the violence and border crossing issues, the city has received a large number of tourists from US, China, Japan and the south of Mexico. Thanks to the realization of cultural and business festivals, the city has improved its image before the world, standing out as a competitive city for investment. Currently, the commercial and business sector is committed to the boom in the gastronomic industry, craft beer, entertainment, and real estate, as well as medical tourism, to attract visitors and investors.

==Geography==

Tijuana is the westernmost city in Mexico, and consequently in Latin America, and the second-largest city in northern Mexico. Located about west of the state capital, Mexicali, the city is bordered to the north by the cities of Imperial Beach, and the San Diego neighborhoods of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, California. To the southwest of the city is Rosarito Beach, while to the south is unincorporated territory of Tijuana Municipality. The city is nestled among hills, canyons, and gullies. The central part of the city lies in a valley through which flows the channeled Tijuana River.

Housing development in the Tijuana Hills has led to eradication of many seasonal mountain streams. This lack of natural drainage makes places within the city vulnerable to landslides during the rainy season. The varied terrain of Tijuana gives the city elevation extremes that range from sea level to . As downtown Tijuana was built at the bottom of the river valley, the district is subject to seasonal flooding created by drain-off from the Tijuana Hills. During this time, east-bound portions of the Via Rapida (east–west highway) may be blocked off by the Tijuana Police due to hazardous conditions.

Tijuana is noted for its rough terrain, which includes many canyons, steep hills, and mesas. Large hills in Tijuana include the Cerro Colorado and the Cerro de las Abejas.

The city is located near the terminus of the Tijuana River and within the Tijuana River Basin. The Tijuana River is an intermittent river, long, on the Pacific coast of northern Baja California in Mexico and Southern California in the United States. It drains an arid area along the California–Baja California border, flowing through Mexico for most of its course and then crossing the border for the last of its course where it forms an estuary that empties into the ocean.

===Cityscape===
The city&#x27;s skyscraper history is relatively recent. Some of the first highrise building complexes constructed in the city were the twin towers of Grand Hotel Tijuana. Tijuana experienced a building boom that was brought to a halt by the Great Recession. Among buildings that succumbed to the time period was the Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico that would have been located in Playas and reached . Currently the tallest building, and soon to be the largest complex in footage, New City Residential reaches . Overall, the city maintains 33 completed structures with other proposed and under-construction skyscrapers.

The Tijuana skyline is the fifth largest skyline in Mexico and is located in the Zona Rio and to a smaller extent, Playas de Tijuana. In the Zona Rio the buildings are concentrated on the Tijuana River, lined parallel to the river; and on the edges of the Tijuana Country Club. In Playas the high rises are currently focused on the coast. Recent construction on high rises has begun in the aforementioned areas, as buildings such as New City Residential and Grand Hotel Tijuana have been developed and taken prominent places in the skyline as the tallest buildings. From Tijuana&#x27;s skyline the San Diego skyline can also be seen, although the reverse is mostly not true on account of the high hills surrounding central Tijuana.

===Boroughs===
The municipality of Tijuana is divided into eight administrative boroughs, or &quot;Delegaciones&quot;. The Tijuana metropolitan area occupies all of borough seats. The boroughs are in turn divided into colonias or ejidos. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development and are served by a &quot;delegado&quot;.

*Centro – &quot;Delegación Centro&quot; includes the old downtown (Zona Centro), new business district (Zona Río), red light district (Zona Norte), and other adjacent neighborhoods (&quot;zonas&quot;). This is the historical midpoint of Tijuana; the municipal palace is located here as well as most of the tourist zones, such as Avenida Revolución and the business district. The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT for CEntro CUltural de Tijuana) is located here as well as the Plaza Río Tijuana, until recently the largest mall in the state, within the Zona Rio.
*Cerro Colorado – The &quot;Cerro Colorado&quot; (&quot;Red Hill&quot;) is located here and it is surrounded by houses. Because of its height many of the area&#x27;s antennas for radio and television stations are located on its peak.
* La Mesa – This is where the Morelos Park, the largest public park in the city, is located, as well as the retail and transit hub Cinco y Diez, Plaza Mundo Divertido, the new Macroplaza and the CETYS University.
*Otay Centenario – This borough was created in 2014 by merging Mesa de Otay and Centenario boroughs. In this borough sits the tijuana International Airport. The Tijuana campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California and the Technologico are also located here as well as many maquiladoras. This is the borough with the largest number of factories and maquiladoras. Its largest colony is &quot;Ciudad Industrial&quot; (&quot;Industrial City&quot;). This delegacion contains the Otay Mesa entry to the United States and the Friendship Park (Parque de la amistad).
*Playas de Tijuana – This is the westernmost borough of the city bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the United States border on the north. This is where the beaches of Tijuana are located (hence the name) and it is also one of the two exits to the south towards Rosarito and Ensenada.
*La Presa – literally &quot;&#x27;the dam&#x27;&quot;, this is the largest borough in size and the Abelardo L. Rodríguez Dam is located within its limits, hence its name. The new Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 and the Tijuana-Tecate freeways run through it.
*San Antonio de los Buenos – This is mostly a residential area although it also has two industrial parks.
*Sanchez Taboada – Like the previous borough this is mostly a residential area, but within its borders are located many &quot;maquiladoras&quot; specially at Pacific Industrial Park.

===Climate===
Tijuana&#x27;s climate has a hot semi-arid (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;), with about of annual precipitation, and generally mild to warm weather year-round. It has characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) found to the immediate north, east, and south east, with most of the annual precipitation falling in the winter, between the months of November and March.

Between November and March, storms originate from fronts entering off of the Pacific Ocean. January is the wettest month of the year for the city and during this time a periodic event, similar to June Gloom, is observed created by marine layer. January is the coolest month, during which temperatures average . In the city April signifies the end of winter and the start of Santa Ana winds. Though the daytime highs are generally around , heat waves can reach up to . The hottest months in the city are August and September, during which temperatures average . Summers are by far the driest time of year since influences from the California Current and the North Pacific High suppress the formation of rainfall caused by the North American Monsoon. Tropical cyclones do impact the city from time to time, however. The most recent to do so was Hurricane Hilary in 2023, which dumped torrential that caused widespread flash floods and landslides.

As in coastal Southern California, air pollution sometimes occurs during periods of temperature inversion, especially during summer and fall, but (unlike Mexico City) is seldom severe and in recent years has lessened due to cleaner car engines.

Frost and snow are rare phenomena in the city as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell in the city and in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On 14 February 2008, a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in the upper reaches of the hills of the city.

The record low temperature recorded in the city was , while the highest was .

==Demographics==

Tijuana has a diverse cosmopolitan population which includes migrants from other parts of Mexico and from all over the world. Tijuana has one of Mexico&#x27;s largest Asian populations, predominantly consisting of Chinese immigrants. Tijuana also has a large and rapidly growing population of Americans, mostly from Southern California. Many Latin Americans, notably Cubans, and Guatemalans, have made Tijuana their home. The city also has many Lebanese, Italian, French and Spanish citizens. Recently, the city has received a large influx of Haitian immigrants.

The majority of Tijuana&#x27;s migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoacán, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because of the diversity of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the majority of the working-class people in northern Mexico. The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city&#x27;s &quot;magnet status&quot; for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty. Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border. Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.

Tijuana today is one of the fastest-growing cities in Mexico, with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly. In terms of area, the city grows by approximately three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons. Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to marginal areas, along with paved roads. The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are still without city services like sidewalks, paving, streetlights, and public transit. This is an ongoing process: as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more marginal areas become occupied by squatters.

National Population Council (CONAPO) data has estimated that by 2030, growth rates maintaining, the city will become the second-largest in Mexico and anchor to the fourth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The suburban sprawl observed in Tijuana leaves the downtown and beach areas relatively affluent.

While the INEGI Census 2010 placed Tijuana&#x27;s population at 1.3 million, only two percent more than in 2005 Census, Tijuana City Council estimates from 2010 place the population closer to two million, at 1.6 million.

 the large majority of the city&#x27;s population, 96%, adhere to the beliefs of Christianity. The denominations are further divided into followers of Catholicism – 61% – and of Protestantism – 35%. While other beliefs occupying a 4% margin in the city include Taoism (among other Asian and European religions), atheism and agnosticism is also found.

===Crime===

Tijuana is the birthplace and base of the Tijuana Cartel. From 2007 through 2010, Tijuana experienced a high level of violent crime related to gang violence, in part derived from the Mexican drug war and human trafficking. Homicides peaked in 2010, when 844 people were killed, compared with 355 in 2004 and 349 in the first eight months of 2011. Reportedly, the wave of violence resulted from a as the administration of President Felipe Calderón weakened the local Arellano Félix cartel; violence slowed when the larger Sinaloa cartel took control.

During the peak years of violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 suspected drug traffickers dead. In 2009 and depending on the source, Tijuana Municipality experienced either 556 or 1,118 murders, mostly as a result of the drug war.

There were 492 murders in 2013, a 48% increase in the homicide rate between 2012 and 2013. This was the highest number of murders since 2010. By the end of 2017, the number of murders in Tijuana increased to 1,744, which was almost double those in 2016.

In 2018, OECD data recorded 2,253 homicides in Tijuana, equivalent to 129.8 per 100,000 inhabitants.

In May 2022, Statista data reported Tijuana as having the second highest homicide rate in the world at 138 per 100,000 inhabitants.

==Government==

At present, the parties with the greatest presence in Tijuana are the National Action Party (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PAN has been the dominant party in the city for 20 years. Historically the PRI had been the dominant party in regional politics, until 1989 when the PAN began to dominate the city, until yet again, in 2004, PRI began regaining prominence and won the Mayor&#x27;s Office.

Less prominent parties also maintain relations with the dominant parties. These other parties, with less presence include the New Alliance Party (PANAL), Social Encounter Party (PES), and Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Allied with the PAN at the state and local level under the Alliance for Baja California are the Social Encounter Party (PES) and New Alliance Party (PANAL). Allied with the PRI at the state and local level under the &quot;Alliance for Better Living&quot; are the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) and Baja California State Party (PEBC).

Tijuana&#x27;s importance and rise to a global city has led to its recognition among countries worldwide. In addition to international cultural recognition, Tijuana has received political recognition and is a developing a political center currently host to eight consulates from European, Asian and North American countries.

==Economy==

Tijuana is the economic center of Baja California and an important center for international trade in The Californias. The city is one of North America&#x27;s most prominent manufacturing centers, as well as a major tourist destination.

Plaza Rio Tijuana is a large regional mall anchored by Cinépolis, Sanborns, Súper DAX and Sears. An important concentration of commercial plazas is in the Cinco y Diez around an eponymous intersection, named for a former American-style five and dime store that was located there. It is also a major hub for public transit. Plaza Carrousel, with its namesake merry-go-round, is located here.

Tijuana, along with the nearby Valle de Guadalupe, has recently become a culinary hotspot due to its Baja Med cuisine, including chefs such as Javier Plascencia, but also for its tacos, other street food, food trucks, coffee houses and artisanal beer.

Tijuana receives 2.5 million medical tourists per year.

===Tourism===
Tijuana also relies on tourism for a major part of its revenue. About 300,000 visitors cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city&#x27;s tourists, many located within walking distance of the border. The city&#x27;s tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around La Sexta, Avenida Revolución, souvenir shopping at the &quot;Mercado de Artesanías&quot; and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana&#x27;s Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza Río Tijuana shopping center, and the city&#x27;s best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Tijuana is also known for being the birthplace of the Caesar salad. Mexico&#x27;s drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revolución.

Tijuana is also known for its red-light district Zona Norte (also referred to as &quot;La Coahuila&quot; after one of its main streets) with legal prostitution in strip clubs and on the street. The strip clubs are typically full-contact, meaning the dancers let patrons fondle them. Many dancers also sell their sexual services. In a 1999 estimation, there were 15,000 women engaged in prostitution in Tijuana outside of clubs and brothels.

Tijuana has many pharmacies that target visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and/or at much lower costs than in the U.S. Many medications still require a Mexican prescription, which can be obtained from adjacent doctors&#x27; offices. People filling up prescriptions for drugs classified in the US as Schedule II or Schedule III have found it more difficult to locate such medications, and the purchase of pseudoephedrine also has become restricted by Tijuana pharmacies, just as in the U.S. To fill a prescription in Tijuana for any drug covered by the US Controlled Substances Act and legally bring it into the United States requires a prescription from the United States for re-import. Americans can import up to a 90-day supply of non-controlled medications for personal use to the US from Mexico and other countries.

Businesses such as auto detailing, medical and dental services and plastic surgery are heavily marketed, and are usually much less expensive than in the U.S.

Tijuana is headquarters for Mexico&#x27;s largest gambling concern, Grupo Caliente, which operates the only casinos in the city, more than twenty branches.

Tourists are sometimes robbed by municipal police.

===Manufacturing===
Tijuana is a large manufacturing center, and in addition to tourism, it serves as a cornerstone of the city economy. In the past decade alone, Tijuana became the medical device manufacture capital of the North American continent, surpassing previous leader Minneapolis–Saint Paul. Recently Scantibodies announced a new plant of 130,000 m2 devoted to manufacturing of medical devices The new plant is a build to suit by FINSA

Tijuana&#x27;s proximity to Southern California, and the city&#x27;s large, skilled, diverse, and relatively inexpensive workforce, make it an attractive city for foreign companies looking to establish extensive industrial parks composed of assembly plants that are called &quot;maquiladoras&quot;, even more so than other cities in the US-Mexican border zone, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to export products. At its peak, in 2001 Tijuana had roughly 820 of these &#x27;maquiladoras&#x27;. Foreign and domestic companies employ thousands of employees in these plants, usually in assembly-related labor. Such jobs are not demanding but typically offer above average salaries for Mexico, with most maqiladoras jobs beginning at MX$100 per day (about 5 US dollars, as of September 2016), significantly above the Mexican minimum wage of Mex$57.46 (about 3 US dollars, as of September 2016). Companies that have set up maquiladoras in Tijuana include Medtronic, Lanix, Hyundai, Sony, Vortec, BMW, Vizio, Toyota, Dell, Samsung, Kodak, Matsushita/Panasonic, GE, Nabisco, Ford, Microsoft, Cemex, Zonda, Philips, Pioneer, Airbus, Plantronics, Siemens Mexico, Jaguar, Sanyo and Volkswagen. Many of the maquiladoras are located in the Otay Mesa and Florido sections of Tijuana.
Economic development has its central business district at Zona Río, which together, with the corridor along Blvd. Agua Caliente (the extension of Avenida Revolución), contains the majority of the higher-end office space in the city. 

==Education==
Tijuana is home to many private Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and High Schools as well as nationally high-ranked colleges and universities.

The Instituto México is a notable secondary school.

Higher education
Universities in Tijuana include:
*Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana
*Ibero-American University
*Xochicalco University
*Cetys Universidad, Tijuana
*Tijuana Institute of Technology
*UNIVERSITAM Technology University

==Culture==

Many foreigners travel to Tijuana to drink and dance, buy prescription drugs, purchase bootleg brand-name clothing, timepieces, and other personal accessories found globally, as well as manufactured and hand-crafted local curiosities. Locals and regular tourists avoid hassles by visiting the clubs at &quot;Plaza Fiesta&quot; or other areas of the Zona Río without the crowds, heavy marketing, and occasional tourist misbehavior or outright lawbreaking common on the Revolución strip.

Parque Morelos has a small zoo and park space; Parque de la Amistad in Otay Centenario has a small pond, and a running and dirt-bike track. Parque Teniente Guerrero is a downtown park with a public library and weekend entertainment by clowns.

===Entertainment===

As Tijuana matured from a tourist-oriented border town into one of Mexico&#x27;s largest cities, the 1982 opening of the Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) marked a milestone. CECUT&#x27;s mission was to strengthening Tijuana&#x27;s image, both to US visitors and to Mexicans, as a destination for culture and not only shopping and vice. The center includes an OMNIMAX cinema showing IMAX films, the Museum of the Californias, contemporary art exhibition halls, a restaurant, café, bookstore, and other cultural facilities.

La Casa de la Cultura cultural center comprises a school, a theater, and a public library, and teaches dance, painting, music, plastic arts, photography and languages.

Other cultural venues include the Instituto Municipal de Arte y Cultura (Municipal Institute of Art and Culture), the Tijuana Wax Museum, the Museo El Trompo (Trompo Museum), and El Foro, the former Jai Alai Palace, that is now a concert venue. Concerts are also held at the Estadio Caliente stadium, Hipódromo Agua Caliente Racetrack, and at the &quot;Audiorama&quot; at the Museo El Trompo children&#x27;s museum of science and technology.

The Tijuana Country Club (Club Campestre de Tijuana) has many affluent members and a famous golf course and also functions as an entertainment and events venue. Tijuana also has a large Rotary Club.

Nightlife

Avenida Revolución has been known for its proliferation of nightclub shows, primarily catering to tourists.

Tijuana&#x27;s nightlife scene is one of the city&#x27;s strongest attractions. The area surrounding &quot;La Sexta&quot;, the intersection at Calle Sexta and Av. Revolución, is now a major hub of new bars and dance clubs. Zona Rio, Tijuana&#x27;s new Downtown, is home to some of the city&#x27;s finest restaurants and bars. Another capstone of Tijuana&#x27;s entertainment offerings is its adult nightlife industry, which includes the city&#x27;s red light district as well as less conspicuous adult entertainment venues.

===Art===
Tijuana also has a very active and independent artist community whose internationally recognized work has earned Tijuana the title of &quot;one of the most important new cultural meccas&quot;, according to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, an exhibition of Tijuana&#x27;s current art scene, is being curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and is traveling across the US in 2006 and 2007. Art collectives like &quot;Bulbo&quot; and film production like &quot;Palenque Filmaciones&quot; explore the use of film like the award-winning Tijuana Makes Me Happy, media like television bulbo TV and print &quot;bulbo PRESS&quot;, to show different realities of Tijuana out of Mexico. In 2004, Tijuana earned international acclaim for an art exhibition displayed on the cement banks of the Tijuana River and along the Mexico/U.S. border fence in Otay Mesa.

Graffiti is widespread in Tijuana. They can range from free-hand writing in spray can and marker form, often carrying social or sexual commentary in English or Spanish, pictures in wheatpaste and stencils, consisting of stenciled renderings of personalities crucial to Hispanic culture from past and present eras, such as television news announcers or stars, but also extending to images of artists like Salvador Dalí. Graffiti in Tijuana may seem at first to consist largely of simplistic tags and thus not as technically evolved, colorful, or accepted in the mainstream as the &quot;pieces&quot; of graffiti scenes of the United States, Europe, or Japan, but large, colorful graffiti murals adorn walls from both native Tijuanan artists as well as visiting graffiti writers, especially from California. The Tijuanan art pieces show as much prowess and skill as those made by their more renowned U.S. counterparts, although illicit graffiti are strongly discouraged by the Tijuana government, as in other major metropolitan areas.

===Music===
Since the decade of the 1920s, Tijuana has excelled in the musical field, thanks to the first groups of ranchera music that began to set the tourist establishments in the area with the visit of foreigners, including the former Casino Agua Caliente.

Javier Batiz founded in 1957 he founded a group called &quot;&quot; with which he collected musical influences that were received in the Mexican border cities of black music, blues and R&amp;B from people like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, James Brown, among others. Later he would start his solo career in the rest of the country and participating in some bands in Mexico City.

During the 60s, the American trumpeter Herb Alpert, in a visit to the bullfights made in the old Bullfight, found musical inspiration so after the recording of his single &quot;The Lonely Bull&quot;, which was a radio hit in 1962. With the success, he decided to make a casting and formed &quot;The Tijuana Brass&quot;, with whom he toured and had a presentation on television. It was a musical collaboration with artists from Los Angeles, with style called &quot;Tijuana Marimba´s Brass&quot;. The band was dissolved in 1969 but they continued with some presentations under the name of T.J.B. 55

Despite the downturn in rock artists for some years, in the 90s Tijuana No! emerged, returning a bit of the genre to the city. They also incorporated ska, punk and reggae. &quot;No&quot; would be the first album released, from which successes like &quot;Pobre de ti&quot;, which had Julieta Venegas as a vocalist, would emerge. Later the singer began her solo career already in the 00s of the 21st century. Her musical career reached the recording of six studio albums, and she won two Grammys, six Latin Grammys, six MTV Latin America and two Latin Music Billboard.

Among other things, Tijuana has been the inspiration for the birthplace of Nortec music style and Ruidoson, resulting in a very large and active electronic music scene where groups and artists like Los Macuanos, Maria y Jose, Siberium, Hidhawk and Harpocrates emerged. Tijuana also enjoys a large base of support in many other musical scenes such as mexican hip hop, reggae, hardcore, punk, black metal and house music. Famous musicians are from Tijuana including the pop-rock singer-songwriter Lynda Thomas and Vanessa Zamora and international indie punk bands like Delux and Los Kung-Fu Monkeys.

To promote the cultural development in children and youth of Tijuana, since 1996 the Tijuana Youth Symphony (SJT) has been promoted, which promotes education and musical training through instrument practices, music reading and public concerts. In addition, Tijuana has an opera season. There are also several musical festivals throughout the year, among which the Latin American Guitar Festival, Mainly Mozart Binacional, and the International Exhibition of contemporary dance &quot;Bodies in Transit&quot; stand out.

Tijuana is home to the Baja California Orchestra, one of the most prestigious and solid artistic institutions in northwestern Mexico, which was nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category of best classical album by the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc., with the album Tango kills Danzón kills Tango. This phonogram was distinguished as &#x27;Best Classical Album of the year 2001&#x27; by the Mexican Union of Theater and Music Chroniclers. Currently, it maintains an annual season, offering symphonic and chamber music concerts in the most important forums of Tijuana and Baja California.

==Sports==

The city is home to the Tijuana Zonkeys professional basketball team of the CIBACOPA basketball league. The team is composed mostly of players from Mexico and plays from February to July in the Municipal Auditorium.

The city has a strong tradition of association football, Club Tijuana began playing in the Liga MX México Primera División on the 2011/12 season, winning the 2012 Apertura title. They play their matches at the Estadio Caliente, a new 33,000-seat stadium. The team&#x27;s mascot is the Xoloitzcuintle, a famous Mexican hairless dog.

Tijuana also has a long history of producing many world champion professional boxers, such as Antonio Margarito and Erik Morales.

===Stadiums===
Estadio Caliente

Estadio Caliente is a multi-purpose stadium in Tijuana, serving as the match venue for Club Tijuana, a Liga MX México Primera División football team. It is mainly used for football matches and has a seating capacity of 27,333 spectators.

Estadio Chevron

The Chevron Stadium is the home of the Toros de Tijuana. It opened in 1977 and housed the Colts missing Tijuana Mexican Pacific League. Subsequently, the stadium was used for football matches. For 2004, professional baseball returned, now with a franchise LMB under the name of &quot;Toros de Tijuana&quot;, which, the following year, changed its name to &quot;Colts&quot; as it had been known previously.

At first the facility was called Cerro Colorado Stadium, due to its location at the foot of the hill of that name. With the return of baseball, chain supermarkets &quot;Calimax&quot; bought the naming rights to the stadium. In 2004, the first season of &quot;Toros&quot;, the fans filled the stadium for most matches. On 4 April 2013, the stadium was remodeled, marking the beginning of a new era for Toros de Tijuana.

==Transportation==

Tijuana is a major gateway to the interior of Mexico to which it is connected by air and road directly, and by sea via the ports of Ensenada and San Diego. Within Tijuana there are freeways and other roads, and buses, but no passenger rail.

Local public transportation in Tijuana is run by semiprivate companies, and has one of the most complex, or perhaps unorganized networks.

===Air===
The Tijuana International Airport is the city&#x27;s main airport, one of the busiest in Mexico, and serves several airlines with destinations all across Mexico. International service to China was discontinued in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic, leaving the airport without international service. Tijuana Airport is also a second main airport for the San Diego area for passengers heading south into Mexico and Latin America, who may use the airport&#x27;s Cross Border Xpress terminal located on the U.S. side of the border in Otay Mesa and connected to the rest of the airport on the Mexican side by a pedestrian toll bridge. U.S., European, Asian and Canadian destinations can be reached via San Diego International Airport, located about north of the international border.

===Highways===

Two important Mexican federal highway corridors start in Tijuana. One of them is Fed 1, which runs south through the Baja California Peninsula through Rosarito Beach, Baja Mar, and Ensenada before ending in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. From Tijuana to Ensenada, most travelers take Fed 1D (scenic road), a four-lane, limited-access toll road that runs along the coast, starting at Playas de Tijuana. Fed 2 runs east for near the international border, as far as Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua.

Within the metropolitan area the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connects Mesa de Otay in the northeast of the city with Rosarito Beach in the southwest.

Just north of the San Ysidro border crossing, Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 head northbound to San Diego and beyond. From the Otay Mesa border crossing, California State Route 905 takes drivers west to connect with California State Route 125 toll road, as well as both I-805 and I-5.

===Transit===
The city&#x27;s main bus station is in its eastern borough. A small terminal downtown serves a few Mexican bus lines, and U.S.-based Greyhound Lines and Crucero USA. Another bus station near the border provides frequent service to Ensenada, and other major cities—including Mazatlán, Culiacán, Hermosillo, and Guadalajara. Major bus lines operating in Tijuana include Azul y Blanco de Magallanes (Blue &amp; White) and Transporte Express de Tijuana – TEEXTI; modernizing system originally intended to phase out the other lines that partially introduced but ceased and merged with Azul y Blanco.

A bus rapid transit system, named SITT, operates one route from Downtown Tijuana and Garita Puerto Mexico near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, southeasterly along the Tijuana River to Terminal Insurgentes in the southeast of the city. It is part of a planned system of main and feeder lines to replace other buses and minibuses.

In 2006, Tijuana underwent a major overhaul of its existing system of &quot;guayines&quot;, or shared fixed-route station wagons, forcing the replacement of the &quot;guayines&quot; with new models of vans, serving as fixed-route taxis. Major transit hubs include Centro (Downtown Tijuana), Otay, Soler, and the &quot;Cinco&quot; y &quot;Diez&quot; avenues. Taxi lines operating in the city include Free Taxis, those that do not maintain a specific route; Economic Taxis; Diamond Taxis – black or yellow cabs; and regular taxis maintaining a set route. There are as many bus lines and routes as fixed-route taxi ones or &quot;calafias&quot;, and new routes for buses, taxis or &quot;calafias&quot; are frequently created, due to high demand of public transportation. Public transportation service is inexpensive, with bus tickets at maximum, US$0.75. Fixed-route taxis are somewhat more expensive, depending on the taxi route, reaching US$2.00. Bus, taxi and &quot;calafia&quot; lines and routes are distinguished from one another by their vehicles colors. However, there is no public record for these routes, set timetables, or fixed bus stops, making Tijuana&#x27;s public transportation services very unreliable especially for lesser served areas. Locals generally transmit this type of information (routes) by word of mouth.

In March 2021, the Secretariat of Infrastructure, Communications and Transportation (Mexico) approved a state contract for the design, construction, and operation of the first phase of a Tijuana-Tecate interurban rail line. The segment will connect the San Ysidro-Tijuana land port of entry to Ejido Maclovio Rojas municipality in Tijuana&#x27;s east and will include seven intermediate stations – Kino, Américas Oriente/Xolos, La 5 y 10, Swap Meet Siglo XX1, García, Terán Terán and El 2000.

==International relations==

Tijuana has multiple sister cities and twin towns. These relations have been formalized by a variety of organizations as well as municipal governments. Currently twinned with the City of Tijuana are:

<text>Double-entry bookkeeping, also known as double-entry accounting, is a method of bookkeeping that relies on a two-sided accounting entry to maintain financial information. Every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. The double-entry system has two equal and corresponding sides, known as debit and credit; this is based on the fundamental accounting principle that for every debit, there must be an equal and opposite credit. A transaction in double-entry bookkeeping always affects at least two accounts, always includes at least one debit and one credit, and always has total debits and total credits that are equal. The purpose of double-entry bookkeeping is to allow the detection of financial errors and fraud.

For example, if a business takes out a bank loan for $10,000, recording the transaction in the bank&#x27;s books would require a DEBIT of $10,000 to an asset account called &quot;Loan Receivable&quot;, as well as a CREDIT of $10,000 to an asset account called &quot;Cash&quot;. For the borrowing business, the entries would be a $10,000 debit to &quot;Cash&quot; and a credit of $10,000 in a liability account &quot;Loan Payable&quot;. For both entities, total equity, defined as assets minus liabilities, has not changed.

The basic entry to record this transaction in the example bank&#x27;s general ledger will look like this:

Double-entry bookkeeping is based on &quot;balancing&quot; the books, that is to say, satisfying the accounting equation. The accounting equation serves as an error detection tool; if at any point the sum of debits for all accounts does not equal the corresponding sum of credits for all accounts, an error has occurred. (However, satisfying the equation does not &quot;necessarily&quot; guarantee a lack of errors, for example, the wrong accounts could have been debited or credited.)

== History ==
The earliest extant accounting records that follow the modern double-entry system in Europe come from Amatino Manucci, a Florentine merchant at the end of the 13th century. Manucci was employed by the Farolfi firm and the firm&#x27;s ledger of 1299–1300 evidences full double-entry bookkeeping. Giovannino Farolfi &amp; Company, a firm of Florentine merchants headquartered in Nîmes, acted as moneylenders to the Archbishop of Arles, their most important customer. Some sources suggest that Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici introduced this method for the Medici bank in the 14th century, though evidence for this is lacking.

The double-entry system began to propagate for practice in Italian merchant cities during the 14th century. Before this there may have been systems of accounting records on multiple books which, however, did not yet have the formal and methodical rigor necessary to control the business economy. In the course of the 16th century, Venice produced the theoretical accounting science by the writings of Luca Pacioli, Domenico Manzoni, Bartolomeo Fontana, the accountant Alvise Casanova and the erudite Giovanni Antonio Tagliente.

Benedetto Cotrugli (Benedikt Kotruljević), a Ragusan merchant and ambassador to Naples, described double-entry bookkeeping in his treatise &quot;Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto&quot;. Although it was originally written in 1458, no manuscript older than 1475 is known to remain, and the treatise was not printed until 1573. The printer shortened and altered Cotrugli&#x27;s treatment of double-entry bookkeeping, obscuring the history of the subject. Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar and collaborator of Leonardo da Vinci, first codified the system in his mathematics textbook &quot;Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalità&quot; published in Venice in 1494. Pacioli is often called the &quot;father of accounting&quot; because he was the first to publish a detailed description of the double-entry system, thus enabling others to study and use it.

In early modern Europe, double-entry bookkeeping had theological and cosmological connotations, recalling &quot;both the scales of justice and the symmetry of God&#x27;s world&quot;.

== Accounting entries ==

In the double-entry accounting system, at least two accounting entries are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts. Recording of a debit amount to one or more accounts and an equal credit amount to one or more accounts results in total debits being equal to total credits when considering all accounts in the general ledger. If the accounting entries are recorded without error, the aggregate balance of all accounts having &quot;Debit&quot; balances will be equal to the aggregate balance of all accounts having &quot;Credit&quot; balances. Accounting entries that debit and credit related accounts typically include the same date and identifying code in both accounts, so that in case of error, each debit and credit can be traced back to a journal and transaction source document, thus preserving an audit trail. The accounting entries are recorded in the &quot;Books of Accounts&quot;. Regardless of which accounts and how many are involved by a given transaction, the fundamental accounting equation of &quot;assets equal liabilities plus equity&quot; will hold.

==Approaches==
There are two different ways to record the effects of debits and credits on accounts in the double-entry system of bookkeeping. They are the Traditional Approach and the Accounting Equation Approach. Irrespective of the approach used, the effect on the books of accounts remains the same, with two aspects (debit and credit) in each of the transactions.

===Traditional approach===
Following the Traditional Approach (also called the British Approach) accounts are classified as real, personal, and nominal accounts. Real accounts are accounts relating to assets both tangible and intangible in nature. Personal accounts are accounts relating to persons or organisations with whom the business has transactions and will mainly consist of accounts of debtors and creditors. Nominal accounts are accounts relating to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. Transactions are entered in the books of accounts by applying the following golden rules of accounting:
# Real account: Debit what comes in and credit what goes out.
# Personal account: Debit the receiver and credit the giver.
# Nominal account: Debit all expenses &amp; losses and credit all incomes &amp; gains

===Accounting equation approach===
This approach is also called the American approach. Under this approach transactions are recorded based on the accounting equation, i.e., Assets = Liabilities + Capital. The accounting equation is a statement of equality between the debits and the credits. The rules of debit and credit depend on the nature of an account. For the purpose of the accounting equation approach, all the accounts are classified into the following five types: assets, capital, liabilities, revenues/incomes, or expenses/losses.

If there is an increase or decrease in a set of accounts, there will be equal decrease or increase in another set of accounts. Accordingly, the following rules of debit and credit hold for the various categories of accounts:
# Assets Accounts: debit entry represents an increase in assets and a credit entry represents a decrease in assets.
# Capital Account: credit entry represents an increase in capital and a debit entry represents a decrease in capital.
# Liabilities Accounts: credit entry represents an increase in liabilities and a debit entry represents a decrease in liabilities.
# Revenues or Incomes Accounts: credit entry represents an increase in incomes and gains, and debit entry represents a decrease in incomes and gains.
# Expenses or Losses Accounts: debit entry represents an increase in expenses and losses, and credit entry represents a decrease in expenses and losses.
These five rules help learning about accounting entries and also are comparable with traditional (British) accounting rules.

== Books of accounts == 

Each financial transaction is recorded in at least two different nominal ledger accounts within the financial accounting system, so that the total debits equals the total credits in the general ledger, i.e. the accounts balance. This is a partial check that each and every transaction has been correctly recorded. The transaction is recorded as a &quot;debit entry&quot; (Dr) in one account, and a &quot;credit entry&quot; (Cr) in a second account. The debit entry will be recorded on the debit side (left-hand side) of a general ledger account, and the credit entry will be recorded on the credit side (right-hand side) of a general ledger account. If the total of the entries on the debit side of one account is greater than the total on the credit side of the same nominal account, that account is said to have a debit balance.

Double entry is used only in nominal ledgers. It is not used in daybooks (journals), which normally do not form part of the nominal ledger system. The information from the daybooks will be used in the nominal ledger and it is the nominal ledgers that will ensure the integrity of the resulting financial information created from the daybooks (provided that the information recorded in the daybooks is correct).

The reason for this is to limit the number of entries in the nominal ledger: entries in the daybooks can be totalled before they are entered in the nominal ledger. If there are only a relatively small number of transactions it may be simpler instead to treat the daybooks as an integral part of the nominal ledger and thus of the double-entry system.

However, as can be seen from the examples of daybooks shown below, it is still necessary to check, within each daybook, that the postings from the daybook balance.

The double entry system uses nominal ledger accounts. From these nominal ledger accounts, a trial balance can be created. The trial balance lists all the nominal ledger account balances. The list is split into two columns, with debit balances placed in the left hand column and credit balances placed in the right hand column. Another column will contain the name of the nominal ledger account describing what each value is for. The total of the debit column must equal the total of the credit column.

==Debits and credits==
Double-entry bookkeeping is governed by the accounting equation. If revenue equals expenses, the following (basic) equation must be true:

:&quot;assets = liabilities + equity&quot;

For the accounts to remain in balance, a change in one account must be matched with a change in another account. These changes are made by debits and credits to the accounts. Note that the usage of these terms in accounting is not identical to their everyday usage. Whether one uses a debit or credit to increase or decrease an account depends on the normal balance of the account. Assets, Expenses, and accounts (on the left side of the equation) have a normal balance of &quot;debit&quot;. Liability, Revenue, and Capital accounts (on the right side of the equation) have a normal balance of &quot;credit&quot;. On a general ledger, debits are recorded on the left side and credits on the right side for each account. Since the accounts must always balance, for each transaction there will be a debit made to one or several accounts and a credit made to one or several accounts. The sum of all debits made in each day&#x27;s transactions must equal the sum of all credits in those transactions. After a series of transactions, therefore, the sum of all the accounts with a debit balance will equal the sum of all the accounts with a credit balance.

Debits and credits are numbers recorded as follows:
* &quot;Debits&quot; are recorded on the left side of a ledger account, a.k.a. T account. Debits increase balances in asset accounts and expense accounts and decrease balances in liability accounts, revenue accounts, and capital accounts.
* &quot;Credits&quot; are recorded on the right side of a T account in a ledger. Credits increase balances in liability accounts, revenue accounts, and capital accounts, and decrease balances in asset accounts and expense accounts.
* &quot;Debit accounts&quot; are asset and expense accounts that usually have debit balances, i.e. the total debits usually exceed the total credits in each debit account.
* &quot;Credit accounts&quot; are revenue (income, gains) accounts and liability accounts that usually have credit balances.

The mnemonic DEADCLIC is used to help remember the effect of debit or credit transactions on the relevant accounts. DEAD: Debit to increase Expense, Asset and Drawing accounts and CLIC: Credit to increase Liability, Income and Capital accounts.

A second popular mnemonic is DEA-LER, where DEA represents Dividend, Expenses, Assets for Debit increases, and Liabilities, Equity, Revenue for Credit increases.

The account types are related as follows:
current equity = sum of equity changes across time (increases on the left side are debits, and increases on the right side are credits, and vice versa for decreases)
current equity = Assets – Liabilities
sum of equity changes across time = owner&#x27;s investment (Capital above) + Revenues – Expenses

<text>Evanston is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States, situated on the North Shore along Lake Michigan. A suburb of Chicago, Evanston is north of downtown Chicago, bordered by Chicago to the south, Skokie to the west, Wilmette to the north, and Lake Michigan to the east. Evanston had a population of 78,110 .

Founded by Methodist business leaders in 1857, the city was incorporated in 1863. Evanston is home to Northwestern University, founded in 1851 before the city&#x27;s incorporation, one of the world&#x27;s leading research universities. Today known for its ethnically diverse population, Evanston is heavily shaped by the influence of Chicago, externally, and Northwestern, internally. The city and the university share a historically complex long-standing relationship.

==History==

Prior to the 1830s, the area now occupied by Evanston was mainly uninhabited, consisting largely of wetlands and swampy forest. However, Potawatomi Native Americans used trails along higher lying ridges that ran in a general north–south direction through the area, and had at least some semi-permanent settlements along the trails.

French explorers referred to the general area as &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot; after a point of land jutting into Lake Michigan about north of the mouth of the Chicago River. After the first non-Native Americans settled in the area in 1836, the names &quot;Grosse Point Territory&quot; and &quot;Gross Point voting district&quot; were used through the 1830s and 1840s, although the territory had no defined boundaries. The area remained only sparsely settled, supporting some farming and lumber activity on some of the higher ground, as well as a number of taverns or &quot;hotels&quot; along the ridge roads. Grosse Pointe itself steadily eroded into the lake during this period.

In 1850, a township called Ridgeville was organized, extending from Graceland Cemetery in Chicago to the southern edge of the Ouilmette Reservation, along what is now Central Street, and from Lake Michigan to Western Avenue in Chicago. The 1850 census shows a few hundred settlers in this township, and a post office with the name of Ridgeville was established at one of the taverns. However, no municipality yet existed.

In 1851, a group of Methodist business leaders founded Northwestern University and Garrett Biblical Institute. Unable to find available land on the north shore up to Lake Forest, the committee was ready to purchase farmland to the west of the city when Orrington Lunt insisted on one final visit to the present location. They chose a bluffed and wooded site along the lake as Northwestern&#x27;s home, purchasing several hundred acres of land from John Foster, a Chicago farm owner. In 1854, the founders of Northwestern submitted to the county judge their plans for a city to be named Evanston after John Evans, one of their leaders. In 1857, the request was granted. The township of Evanston was split off from Ridgeville Township; at approximately the same time, that portion of Ridgeville south of Devon Avenue was organized as Lake View Township.

Evanston was formally incorporated as a town on December 29, 1863, but declined in 1869 to become a city despite the Illinois legislature passing a bill for that purpose. Evanston expanded after the Civil War with the annexation of the village of North Evanston. Finally, in early 1892, following the annexation of the village of South Evanston, voters elected to organize as a city. The 1892 boundaries are largely those that exist today.

In the late summer of 1912, the beaches in Evanston were infested with thousands of rats. The rats had burrowed into the sides of the lake banks, dug holes in the sand, and hid under piers. Most of the rats were extremely large and savage, attacking people who disturbed them. Local bathers struggled to navigate the shores, constantly stepping into the hidden rat holes. John Morgan, the manager of an extermination company tasked with removing the vermin, stated that it was not uncommon for rats to live around the lake&#x27;s shore because of the quantity of dead fish that was cast to shore by the waves. The weather also played a role since the close proximity to the beaches allowed the rats to swim out in the water during the hot summer.

During the 1960s, Northwestern University changed the city&#x27;s shoreline by adding a lakefill.

In 1939, Evanston hosted the first NCAA basketball championship final at Northwestern University&#x27;s Patten Gymnasium.

In August 1954, Evanston hosted the second assembly of the World Council of Churches, still the only WCC assembly to have been held in the United States. President Dwight Eisenhower welcomed the delegates, and Dag Hammarskjöld, secretary-general of the United Nations, delivered an important address entitled &quot;An instrument of faith&quot;.

Evanston first received power in April 1893. Many people lined the streets on Emerson St. where the first appearance of street lights were lined and turned on. Today, the city is home to Northwestern University, Music Institute of Chicago, and other educational institutions, as well as headquarters of Alpha Phi International women&#x27;s fraternity, Rotary International, the National Merit Scholarship Corporation, the National Lekotek Center, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, the Sigma Chi fraternity and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union.

Evanston is the birthplace of Tinkertoys, and is one of the locations claiming to have originated the ice cream sundae. Evanston was the home of the Clayton Mark and Company, which for many years supplied the most jobs.

Evanston was a dry community from 1858 until 1972, when the City Council voted to allow restaurants and hotels to serve liquor on their premises. In 1984, the Council voted to allow retail liquor outlets within the city limits.

In March 2021, Evanston became the first city in the United States to pay reparations to African American residents (or their descendants) who were victims of unfair housing practices. The city council of the city voted 8 to 1 to approve the reparations which consisted of a $25,000 payment to African American households that can be used as down payments on their homes, house payments or for home repairs. This was the initial payment, with plans to distribute $10 million in reparations payments to Black residents over the next decade.

In August 2021, Evanston became one of the first cities to approve a pilot project providing a guaranteed income to select residents, drawing upon a combination of public funds and a partnership with Northwestern University.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Evanston has a total area of , of which (or 99.72%) is land and (or 0.28%) is water.

===Climate Action Plan===
In October 2006, the city voted to sign the United States Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, and a number of citizen task forces convened to develop a plan to reduce the city&#x27;s carbon footprint. The Evanston Climate Action Plan (&quot;ECAP&quot;), accepted by the City Council in November 2008, suggested over 200 strategies to make Evanston more sustainable, principally by reducing carbon emissions associated with transportation, buildings, energy sources, waste, and food production. In June 2011, the United States Conference of Mayors awarded Evanston first place in the small city category of the Mayors&#x27; Climate Protection Awards, based largely on the city&#x27;s use of the ECAP, which the city asserts has reduced emissions by 24,000 metric tons per year. On September 15, 2011, Wal-Mart presented Mayor Tisdahl with a $15,000 award in recognition of the honor, which the mayor donated to Citizens&#x27; Greener Evanston.

*Beacon Academy, a Montessori high school
*Chiaravalle Montessori School, a Montessori school for children ages 2–14
*Midwest Montessori School
*Pope John XXIII School, a Catholic school serving children pre-kindergarten through eighth grade. The school dates back to 1886 with the establishment of separate schools serving St. Nicholas and St. Mary&#x27;s parishes in Evanston. The original St. Nicholas School was in the building now called the Annex. The main school building was built in 1954. In 1986 the two parish schools consolidated and the new school was renamed Pope John XXIII School. In 2023, the St. Nicholas parish was renamed to St. John XXIII parish and the St. Mary&#x27;s parish was closed due to funding issues.
*Roycemore School
*St. Athanasius School, a Catholic school for children from junior kindergarten through eighth grade. &quot;St. A&#x27;s&quot; is a popular shortened nickname for the school and it is part of the St. Athanasius parish in Northwest Evanston.

===Universities===
In 2006, National-Louis University closed its former main site, which had of land, with about 33% in Evanston; the majority of the land was in Wilmette.

Founded in 1855, Evanston is home to Northwestern University. Located along Lake Michigan, Northwestern&#x27;s campus spans 240 acres with an estimated 250 buildings. Since 1908, Kellogg School of Management as well as Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary (1853) have institutions, of which both share the campus with Northwestern.

===Use as film location===
Evanston&#x27;s variety of housing and commercial districts, combined with easy access to Chicago, make it a popular filming location. Evanston as of December 2008 is listed as a filming location for 65 different films, notably those of John Hughes. Much of the 1984 film &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; was filmed in and around Evanston, the 1988 film &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot;, as was the 1989 film &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;, the 1993 film &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, and the 1997 film &quot;Home Alone 3&quot;. A number of scenes from the 1986 Garry Marshall film &quot;Nothing in Common&quot; were filmed on the Northwestern University campus and Evanston&#x27;s lakeshore. Although not filmed there, the 2004 film &quot;Mean Girls&quot; is set in the Chicago suburbs, and makes several references to the area. The movie&#x27;s screenwriter and co-star, Tina Fey, had worked at the Evanston YMCA when starting her comedy career. In the 2003 film &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, the family moves to Evanston. Additionally, 1993 film &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot;, starring Gary Busey and Thomas Ian Nicholas, was partially shot at Haven Middle School. The 2015 ABC Family reality series &quot;Becoming Us&quot; was filmed in Evanston.

In &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, according to IMDb, the screenplay says that the boy and his grandfather live in Evanston. This was also stated by Mandy Patinkin in a behind-the-scenes interview. The story&#x27;s author, William Goldman, was born in Chicago and grew up in Highland Park a little more than ten miles north of Evanston.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Evanston&#x27;s growth occurred largely because of its accessibility from Chicago by rail. The Northwestern founders did not finalize their commitment to siting the university there until they were assured the Chicago &amp; Milwaukee Railway line would run there. C&amp;M trains began stopping in Evanston in 1855. Evanston later experienced rapid growth as one of the first streetcar suburbs. The North Shore Line, the interurban railroad that gave the area its nickname, ran through Evanston and continued to Waukegan and Milwaukee.

The city is still connected to Chicago by rail transit. The CTA&#x27;s Purple Line, part of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; system, runs through Evanston. From its terminal at Howard in Chicago, the line heads north to the South Boulevard, Main, Dempster, Davis, Foster, Noyes, and Central stations, before terminating at the Linden station in Wilmette. During weekday rush hours, the Purple Line extends another south on the North Side Main Line from Howard to downtown Chicago running express from Howard to , with a single stop at , and then making all local stops from Belmont to the Loop. The express service is known as the Purple Line Express (or the Evanston Express). Metra&#x27;s Union Pacific North Line also serves Evanston, with stations at Main Street, Davis Street and Central Street, the first two being adjacent to Purple Line stations. The CTA&#x27;s Yellow Line also runs through the city, though it does not stop there. Evanston is served by six CTA bus routes as well as four Pace bus routes.

Automobile routes from Chicago to Evanston include Lake Shore Drive, the Edens Expressway (I-94), and McCormick Boulevard, although the first two of those do not extend to Evanston itself and require driving through Rogers Park (via Sheridan Road or Ridge Avenue) and Skokie, respectively. The main routes from the north are the Edens, Green Bay Road, and Sheridan Road. Active modes of transportation include miles of sidewalks and bicycle lanes.

===Health care===
Two hospitals are located within Evanston&#x27;s city limits:

*Evanston Hospital, part of NorthShore University HealthSystem
*Ascension Saint Francis Hospital Evanston, part of Ascension

==Notable people==
==University relations==
A perennial debate in Evanston is the issue of Northwestern University&#x27;s status as a tax-exempt institution. In the founding charter of Northwestern University, signed in 1851, the state granted the school an exemption from paying property taxes, and unlike other well-off private universities with statutory exemptions, it provides its own police services, but not firefighter/paramedic services. It pays water, sewer, communications, real property transfer taxes, and building permit fees, but not property taxes. Northwestern does not make Payments in Lieu of Taxes for the real estate it removes from property tax rolls.

Its backers, like former Evanston mayor and Northwestern alumna Lorraine H. Morton, contend that the benefits of having an elite research institution justify Northwestern&#x27;s tax status. These supporters highlight the fact that Northwestern University is the largest employer in Evanston, and that its students and faculty constitute a large consumer base for Evanston businesses. This controversy was revived in 2003 when the university purchased an eight-story office building downtown, removing it from the tax rolls. An advisory referendum put on the April elections ballot, dubbed by supporters as a &quot;Fair Share Initiative&quot;, received a majority, but was not passed into ordinance by the City Council.

During the tenure of Elizabeth Tisdahl as mayor, relationships between the university and Evanston improved. Upon arriving at Northwestern in 2009 president Morton O. Schapiro forged a strong working relationship with Tisdahl; in 2015, the two announced that Northwestern would begin to donate $1 million annually to benefit city services and programs.

==Nicknames==
* Early after its founding, because of its strong Methodist influence, and its attempt to impose moral rigor, Evanston was called &quot;Heavenston&quot;.
*In the early 20th century Evanston was called &quot;The City of Churches&quot;.
* The varied works of numerous prominent architects, and many prominent mansions, especially near the lakefront, gave the town by the 1920s the sobriquet &quot;The City of Homes&quot;, a fact often touted by local real estate agents. Use of the phrase has been attributed to a 1924 speech at the local Kiwanis club.
* Since the late 20th century, because of Evanston&#x27;s activism and often left-of-center politics, it is sometimes humorously (or sarcastically) referred to as &quot;The People&#x27;s Republic of Evanston&quot;.

<doc id="101759" wikidata="Q2592931" url="?curid=101759" title="Woman's Christian Temperance Union">
<text>The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) is an international temperance organization. It was among the first organizations of women devoted to social reform with a program that &quot;linked the religious and the secular through concerted and far-reaching reform strategies based on applied Christianity.&quot; It plays an influential role in the temperance movement. Originating among women in the United States Prohibition movement, the organization supported the Eighteenth Amendment and was also influential in social reform issues that came to prominence in the Progressive Era.

The WCTU was originally organized on December 23, 1873, in Hillsboro, Ohio, and starting on December 26 Matilda Gilruth Carpenter led a successful campaign to close saloons in Washington Court House, Ohio. WCTU was officially declared at a national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, November 18–20, 1874.

It operated at an international level and in the context of religion and reform, including missionary work and women&#x27;s suffrage. Two years after its founding, the American WCTU sponsored an international conference at which the International Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union was formed. The World&#x27;s Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1883 and became the international arm of the organization, which has now affiliates in Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Finland, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States, among others.

The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union conducts a White Ribbon Recruit (WRR) ceremony, in which babies are dedicated to the cause of temperance through a white ribbon being tied to their wrists, with their adult sponsors pledging to help the child live a life free from alcohol and other drugs.

==Establishment==
At its founding in 1874, the stated purpose of the WCTU was to create a &quot;sober and pure world&quot; by abstinence, purity, and evangelical Christianity. Annie Wittenmyer was its first president. Wittenmyer was conservative in her goals for the movement focusing only on the question of alcohol consumption and avoiding involvement in politics. The constitution of the WCTU called for &quot;the entire prohibition of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage.&quot;

Frances Willard, the second WCTU president, objected to this limited focus of social issues WCTU was addressing. Willard believed that it was necessary for the WCTU to be political in women’s issues for the success, expansion, and implementation of WCTU. In 1879, Willard successfully became president of the WCTU until her death in 1898. During her presidency, the WCTU grew significantly and established the relationship between temperance and suffrage. Despite advocating for women, WCTU did not challenge gender roles, rather they integrated elements of &quot;Protofeminism&quot; into the organization.

Its members were inspired by the Greek writer Xenophon, who defined temperance as &quot;moderation in all things healthful; total abstinence from all things harmful.&quot; In other words, should something be good, it should not be indulged in to excess; should something be bad for you, it should be avoided altogether—thus their attempts to rid society of what they saw (and still see) as the dangers of alcohol.

The WCTU perceived alcohol as a cause and consequence of larger social problems rather than as a personal weakness or failing. The WCTU also advocated against tobacco. The American WCTU formed a &quot;Department for the Overthrow of the Tobacco Habit&quot; as early as 1885 and frequently published anti-tobacco articles in the 1880s. Agitation against tobacco continued through to the 1950s.

==Policy interests==
As a consequence of its stated purposes, the WCTU was also very interested in a number of social reform issues, including labor, prostitution, public health, sanitation, and international peace. As the movement grew in numbers and strength, members of the WCTU also focused on suffrage. The WCTU was instrumental in organizing woman&#x27;s suffrage leaders and in helping more women become involved in American politics. Local chapters, known as &quot;unions&quot;, were largely autonomous, though linked to state and national headquarters. Willard pushed for the &quot;Home Protection&quot; ballot, arguing that women, being the morally superior sex, needed the vote in order to act as &quot;citizen-mothers&quot; and protect their homes and cure society&#x27;s ills. At a time when suffragists were viewed as radicals and alienated most American women, the WCTU offered a more traditionally feminine and &quot;appropriate&quot; organization for women to join.

Home Protection interests also extended to Labor rights, and an openness to Socialism. WCTU had a close association with the Knights of Labor, sharing goals for class harmony, sober and disciplined workers, and a day of rest. Concern for workers&#x27; conditions and the effect on family life led many members to also critique the exploitation of capital, as well as demand a living wage.

Although the WCTU had chapters throughout North America with hundreds of thousands of members, the &quot;Christian&quot; in its title was largely limited to those with an evangelical Protestant conviction and the importance of their role has been noted. The goal of evangelizing the world, according to this model, meant that very few Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists or Hindus were attracted to it, &quot;even though the last three had a pronounced cultural and religious preference for abstinence&quot;. As the WCTU grew internationally, it developed various approaches that helped with the inclusion of women of religions other than Christianity. But, it was always primarily, and still is, a Christian women&#x27;s organization.

The WCTU&#x27;s work extended across a range of efforts to bring about personal and social moral reform. In the 1880s, it worked on creating legislation to protect working girls from the exploitation of men, including raising Age of Consent laws. It also focused on keeping Sundays as Sabbath days and restrict frivolous activities. In 1901 the WCTU said that golf should not be allowed on Sundays.

The WCTU was also involved with efforts to alleviate poverty by discouraging the purchase of alcohol products. Through journal articles, the WCTU tried to prove that abstinence would help people move up in life. A fictional story in one of their journal articles illustrates this fact:

Ned has applied for a job, but he is not chosen. He finds that the potential employer has judged him to be like his Uncle Jack. Jack is a kindly man but he spends his money on drink and cigarettes. Ned has also been seen drinking and smoking. The employer thinks that Ned Fisher lacks the necessary traits of industriousness which he associates with abstinence and self-control.

==Spread and influence==
The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union grew rapidly. The WCTU adopted Willard&#x27;s &quot;Do Everything&quot; philosophy, which meant that the &quot;W.C.T.U. campaigned for local, state, and national prohibition, woman suffrage, protective purity legislation, scientific temperance instruction in the schools, better working conditions for labor, anti-polygamy laws, Americanization, and a variety of other reforms&quot; despite having the image of a gospel temperance organization. The presidential addresses of the WCTU provide excellent insight as to how the organization seamlessly blended issues of grass-roots organizing, temperance, education, immigration and cultural assimilation.

One prominent state chapter was the Minnesota Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. The Minnesota chapter&#x27;s origin is rooted in nation&#x27;s anti-saloon crusades of 1873 and 1874 where women all throughout the United States &quot;joined together outside saloons to pray and harass the customers.&quot; In Minnesota there was stiff resistance to this public display and &quot;in Anoka, Minnesota, &#x27;heroic women endured the insults of the saloon-keeper and his wife who poured cold water upon the women from an upper window while they prayed on the sidewalk below. Sometimes beer was thrown on the sidewalk so that they could not kneel there but they prayed.&#x27;&quot; As a result, Minnesotan women were motivated and &quot;formed local societies, which soon united to become the National Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union in 1874. Women from St. Paul, Minneapolis, Red Wing, and Owatonna organized their first local W.C.T.U. clubs between 1875 and 1877. The Minnesota WCTU began in the fall of 1877. From this point the Minnesota WCTU began to expand throughout the state in both size and interests.

The Minnesota WCTU worked hard to extol the values of the WCTU which included converting new immigrants to American culture or &quot;Americanization.&quot; Bessie Laythe Scovell, a native New Englander that moved to Minnesota in the 1800s and served as president of the Minnesota WCTU chapter from 1897–1909 delivered her 1900 &quot;President&#x27;s Address&quot;, where she expounded on the methods the Minnesota chapter of the WCTU would utilize to accomplish its variety of goals within the state. Scovell adopted what was at the time a &quot;progressive&quot; approach to the issue of immigrants, particularly German and Scandinavian in Minnesota, indulging in alcohol and stated:

We must have a regiment of American workers, who will learn the German language, love the German people, work among the German children and young people until we get them to love clear brains better than beer. There must be others who for the love of country and dear humanity will learn the Scandinavian language and be real neighbors to the many people of this nationality who have come to make homes in America. Again others must learn the French and Italian and various dialects, even, that the truths of personal purity and total abstinence be taught to these who dwell among us. We must feel it a duty to teach these people the English language to put them in sympathy with our purposes and our institutions.

For Scovell and the women of the Minnesota WCTU, speaking English and participating in established American institutions were essential to truly become &quot;American&quot; just as abstaining from alcohol was necessary to be virtuous. By linking language to culture and institutions, Scovell and the WCTU recognized that a multicultural approach would be necessary to communicate values to new immigrants, but did not conclude that multiculturalism was a value in itself. The WCTU viewed the foreign European cultures as a corrupter and despoiler of virtue, hence the excessive drinking. That is ultimately why it was paramount the immigrants learned English and assimilated.

===WCTU and race===
The WCTU, while a predominantly white organisation, did boast a significant black and indigenous membership. In 1901 Eliza Pierce, a Native American woman, started her own New York chapter of the union, which was featured in &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot; in 1902.

Moreover, there are many references to African American members in the literature surrounding the WCTU, although this is often in passing. Predominant black activist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper was very active in the union, pushing for WTCU adoption of the anti-lynching cause. However, in the end Willard favoured the desires of white Southern women and this campaign fell to the side-lines.

In 1889 Harper formally requested that &quot;in dealing with colored people... Christian courtesy be shown.&quot; The WTCU did receive criticism from black activists, most notably the well-known reformer Ida B. Wells, who condemned Willard for her statements regarding black drunkenness. In general, black women faced similar pressures within the WCTU that they did in wider society, but this did not stop them from contributing to the movement.

==Prohibition==

In 1893, the WCTU switched focus toward prohibition, which was ultimately successful when the 18th amendment to the US Constitution was passed. After prohibition was instituted, WCTU membership declined.

Over the years, different prohibition and suffrage activists had suspected that brewer associations gave money to anti-suffrage activities. In 1919, there was a Senate investigation that confirmed their suspicions. Some members of the United States Brewers Association were openly against the woman&#x27;s suffrage movement. One member stated, &quot;We have defeated woman&#x27;s suffrage at three different times.&quot;

Although the WCTU was an explicitly religious organization and worked with religious groups in social reform, it protested wine use in religious ceremonies. During an Episcopal convention, it asked the church to stop using wine in its ceremonies and to use unfermented grape juice instead. A WCTU direct resolution explained its reasoning: wine contained &quot;the narcotic poison, alcohol, which cannot truly represent the blood of Christ.&quot;

The WCTU also favored banning tobacco. In 1919, the WCTU expressed to Congress its desire for the total abolition of tobacco within five years.

Under Willard, the WCTU supported the White Life for Two program. Under this program, men would reach women&#x27;s higher moral standing (and thus become woman&#x27;s equal) by engaging in lust-free, alcohol-free, tobacco-free marriages. At the time, the organization also fought to ban alcohol use on military bases, in Native American reservations, and within Washington&#x27;s institutions. Ultimately, Willard succeeded in increasing the political clout of the organization because, unlike Annie Wittenmyer, she strongly believed that the success of the organization would only be achieved through the increased politicization of its platform.

==Reach==
In the United States, the WCTU was divided along ideological lines. The first president of the organization, Annie Wittenmyer, believed in the singleness of purpose of the organization—that is, that it should not put efforts into woman suffrage, prohibition, etc. This wing of the WCTU was more concerned with how morality played a role during the temperance movement. With that in mind, it sought to save those whom they believed to be of lower moral character. For them, the alcohol problem was one of moral nature and was not caused by the institutions that facilitated access to alcohol.


The second president of the WCTU, Frances Willard, demonstrated a sharp distinction from Wittenmyer. Willard had a much broader interpretation of the social problems at hand. She believed in &quot;a living wage; in an eight-hour day; in courts of conciliation and arbitration; in justice as opposed to greed in gain; in Peace on Earth and Good-Will to Men.&quot; This division illustrated two of the ideologies present in the organization at the time, conservatism and progressivism. To some extent, the Eastern Wing of the WCTU supported Wittenmyer and the Western Wing had a tendency to support the more progressive Willard view.

Membership within the WCTU grew greatly every decade until the 1940s. By the 1920s, it was in more than forty countries and had more than 766,000 members paying dues at its peak in 1927.

==Current status==
The WCTU remains an internationally active organization. In American culture, although &quot;temperance norms have lost a great deal of their power&quot; and there are far fewer dry communities today than before ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment, there is still at least one WCTU chapter in almost every U.S. state and in 36 other countries around the world.

Requirements for joining the WCTU include paying membership dues and signing a pledge to abstain from alcohol.
The pledge of the Southern Californian WCTU, for example, is &quot;I hereby solemnly promise, God helping me, to abstain from all distilled, fermented, and malt liquors, including beer, wine, and hard cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the use of and traffic in the same.&quot; Current issues for the WCTU include alcohol, which the organization considers to be North America&#x27;s number one drug problem, as well as illegal drugs, and abortion. The WCTU has warned against the dangers of tobacco since 1875. They continue to this day in their fight against those substances they see as harmful to society.

The last edition of the WCTU&#x27;s quarterly journal, titled &quot;The Union Signal&quot;, was published in 2015, the main focus of which was current research and information on drugs. Other national organizations also continue to publish.

The WCTU also attempts to encourage young people to avoid substance abuse through participation in three age-divided suborganizations: White Ribbon Recruits for pre-schoolers, the Loyal Temperance Legion (LTL) for elementary school children, and the Youth Temperance Council (YTC) for teenagers.

The White Ribbon Recruits are mothers who will publicly declare their dedication to keeping their babies drug-free. To do this, they participate in the White Ribbon Ceremony, but their children must be under six years of age. The mother pledges &quot;I promise to teach my child the principles of total abstinence and purity&quot;, and the child gets a white ribbon tied to its wrist.

The Loyal Temperance Legion (LTL), is another temperance group aimed at children. It is for children aged six to twelve who are willing to pay dues annually to the LTL. Its motto is &quot;That I may give my best service to home and country, I promise, God helping me, Not to buy, drink, sell, or give alcoholic liquors while I live. From other drugs and tobacco I&#x27;ll abstain, And never take God&#x27;s name in vain.&quot;

The Youth Temperance Council is the final type of group meant for youths and is aimed at teenagers. Its pledge is &quot;I promise, by the help of God, never to use alcoholic beverages, other narcotics, or tobacco, and to encourage everyone else to do the same, fulfilling the command, &#x27;keep thyself pure&#x27;.&quot;

==World&#x27;s WCTU==
The World&#x27;s WCTU (WWCTU) is one of the most prominent examples of internationalism, evidenced by the circulation of the &quot;Union Signal&quot; around the globe; the International Conventions that were held with the purpose of focusing &quot;world attention on the temperance and women&#x27;s questions, and the appointment of &quot;round-the-world missionaries.&quot; Examples of international Conventions include the one in 1893 scheduled to coincide with the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair; the London Convention in 1895; the 1897 one in Toronto; and the Glasgow one in 1910. The first six round-the-world missionaries were Mary C. Leavitt, Jessie Ackermann, Alice Palmer, Mary Allen West, Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew, and Katharine Bushnell.

The ambition, reach and organizational effort involved in the work undertaken by the World&#x27;s WCTU leave it open to cynical criticism in the 21st century, but there is little doubt that at the end of the 19th century, &quot;they did believe earnestly in the efficacy of women&#x27;s temperance as a means for uplifting their sex and transforming the hierarchical relations of gender apparent across a wide range of cultures.&quot;

===South Africa===
Amongst the presidents of the Cape Colony WCTU was Georgiana Solomon, who eventually became a world vice-president.

===New Zealand===
As early as 6 August 1884, under the leadership of Eliza Ann Palmer Brown in Invercargill, a WCTU branch had started in New Zealand. Arriving in January 1885, a prominent American missionary, Mary Leavitt, traveled to Auckland, New Zealand to spread the message of the WCTU. For the next eight years, Leavitt traveled around New Zealand establishing WCTU branches and advocating for women to, &quot;protect their homes and families from liquor, by claiming their rightful voice&quot; and work to end the over-consumption of alcohol through gaining the vote. Working alongside Leavitt was Anne Ward, a New Zealand social worker and temperance activist, who served as the first national president of the WCTU in New Zealand.

Māori women were also active members of the WCTU in New Zealand. In 1911, during the presidency of Fanny Cole, Hera Stirling Munro, Jean McNeish of Cambridge and Rebecca Smith of Hokianga organised a WCTU convention at Pakipaki specifically by and for Māori. Many Māori women signed WCTU-initiated national franchise petitions. Specifically, the 1892 WCTU petition was signed by Louisa Matahau of Hauraki and Herewaka Poata from Gisborne, and the 1893 petition was also signed by Matilda Ngapua from Napier and four other Māori women using European names instead.

The WCTU played a significant role in New Zealand, because it was the only public organisation in the country that could provide women political and leadership experience and training, and as a result, well over half of suffragists at the time were members of the organisation. One of the most notable New Zealand suffragists was Kate Sheppard, who was the leader of the WCTU&#x27;s franchise department, and advised women in the WCTU to work closely with members of Parliament in order to get their ideas in political discourse. This eventually led to women winning the right to vote in 1893. Some prominent New Zealand suffragists and WCTU members include Kate Sheppard, Learmonth Dalrymple, Meri Te Tai Mangakāhia, Elizabeth Caradus, Kate Milligan Edger, Christina Henderson, Annie Schnackenberg, Anne Ward, and Lily Atkinson.

===Canada===
The WCTU formed in Canada in 1874, in Owen Sound, Ontario. and spread across Canada. The Newfoundland branch played an important part in campaigning for women&#x27;s suffrage on the grounds that women were vital in the struggle for prohibition. In 1885 Letitia Youmans founded an organization which was to become the leading women&#x27;s society in the national temperance movement. Youmans is often credited with spreading the organization across the country. One notable member was Edith Archibald of Nova Scotia. Notable Canadian feminist Nellie McClung was also involved.

=== Newfoundland ===
The Newfoundland chapter of the WCTU formed in September 1890. Early supporters included Reverend Mr. A.D. Morton, the Methodist minister of Gower Street Church, and local women such as Emma Peters, Lady Jeanette Thorburn, Jessie Ohman, Maria C. Williams, Elizabeth Neyle, Margaret Chancey, Ceclia Fraser, Rev. Mrs. Morton, Mrs. E.H. Bulley, Tryphenia Duley, Sarah (Rowsell) Wright and Fanny Stowe.

The WCTU agitated for women&#x27;s suffrage in the Dominion especially in the wake of the sacrifices of WW1, but did not see this realized until 1925.

===India===

The WCTU formed in India was formed in the 1880s. It publishes &quot;Temperance Record and White Ribbon&quot;, remaining very active today.

===Australia===

The first Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union in Sydney was formed by Euphemia Bridges Bowes in 1882 although other sources credit the start to later visits from Jessie Ackermann in 1889 and 1891; a number of other Christian Temperance and Abstinence Societies existed throughout Australia before that time. Sara Susan Nolan succeeded Euphemia Bridges Bowes as President in Sydney in 1892.

Jessie Ackermann acted as the round the world missionary for the American-based World&#x27;s WCTU, and became the inaugural president of the federated Australasian WCTU, Australia&#x27;s largest women&#x27;s reform group. Maria Elizabeth Kirk was the first secretary. The union were active in the struggle for the extension of the franchise to women through promoting suffrage societies, collecting signatures for petitions and lobbying members of parliament. (See, for example, Women&#x27;s suffrage in Australia.) After visiting New Zealand, Miss Ackermann came to Hobart in May 1889, then toured the mainland for almost 12 months, stopping in Adelaide, Port Augusta, Clare, Kapunda and Burra in June to August, Mount Gambier, Brisbane, Sydney, and Bathurst. She returned for a further visit, including Melbourne in 1891.

In Victoria, weekly temperance conferences were held at the East Melbourne home of Margaret McLean, a founding member and coordinator of the Melbourne branch of the WCTU of Victoria; she was president of the organisation for two periods, 1892–93 and 1899–1907. Jessie Mary Lloyd (1883–1960) was the WCTU State President in 1930 when a poll of Victoria returned 43% in favour of a ban on alcohol.

The Queensland chapter established itself by 1928 at Willard House, River Road (now Coronation Drive), North Quay, near the Brisbane River. The state organiser in 1930 was Zara Dare who went on to become one of the first female police officers in Queensland in 1931.

===Sweden===

The Swedish WCTU, known as &quot;Vita Bandet&quot; (White Ribbon) was founded by Emilie Rathou in Östermalm in Stockholm in 1900. Rathou was a leading member of the International Organisation of Good Templars, and the pioneer for organizing the WCTU and its local branches in Sweden.

==Woman&#x27;s Temperance Publishing Association==
The Woman&#x27;s Temperance Publishing Association (WPTA) was located in Chicago from 1880 until 1903. It was conceptualized by Matilda B. Carse and established initially in Indianapolis by Zerelda G. Wallace. They thought there was a need for a weekly temperance paper for women of color. The creators wanted the first board of directors to be seven women who had the same vision as Carse.

===Frances Willard===
In 1874 Willard was elected the new secretary of the WCTU. Five years later, in 1879, she became its president. Willard also started her own organization, called the World&#x27;s Women Christian Temperance Union, in 1883.

After becoming WCTU&#x27;s president, Willard broadened the views of the group by including woman&#x27;s rights reforms, abstinence, and education. As its president for 19 years, she focused on moral reform of prostitutes and prison reform as well as woman&#x27;s suffrage. With the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, Willard&#x27;s predictions that women voters &quot;would come into government and purify it, into politics and cleanse the Stygian pool&quot; could be tested. Frances Willard died in February 1898 at the age of 58 in New York City. A plaque commemorating Willard&#x27;s election to president of the WCTU in 1879 by Lorado Taft is in the Indiana Statehouse, Indianapolis, Indiana.

===Matilda Bradley Carse===

Matilda B. Carse became an activist after her son was killed in 1874 by a drunk wagon driver. She joined the Chicago Central Christian Woman&#x27;s Temperance Union to try to eliminate alcohol consumption. In 1878 she became the president of the Chicago Central Christian Woman&#x27;s Temperance Union, and in 1880 she helped organize the Woman&#x27;s Temperance Publishing Association, selling the stock to rich women. That same year she also started &quot;The Signal;&quot; three years later it merged with another newspaper to become &quot;The Union Signal&quot;. It became the most important woman&#x27;s newspaper and soon sold more copies than any other newspaper. It was Carse who was driving force behind the construction of Chicago&#x27;s Temperance Temple.

During her time as president, Carse founded many charities and managed to raise approximately $60,000,000 a year to support them. She started the Bethesda Day Nursery for working mothers, two kindergarten schools, the Anchorage Mission for erring girls, two dispensaries, two industrial schools, an employment bureau, Sunday schools, and temperance reading rooms.

<text>Belair National Park (formerly known as the National Park and as Belair Recreation Park) is a protected area in Belair, South Australia, southeast of Adelaide city centre; it covers an area of . It was proclaimed in 1891 and was the first national park in South Australia, second in Australia (after Sydney&#x27;s Royal National Park which was proclaimed in 1879) and the tenth in the world. The national park lies within the Adelaide Hills and Mitcham council area, and forms part of a chain of protected areas located along the Adelaide Hills Face Zone. The national park is administered by the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources.

==Naming==
For most of its existence, it has been known as the &#x27;National Park&#x27;. Between the years 1972 and 1991 it was known as the &#x27;Belair Recreation Park&#x27;. In 1991, the Belair Recreation Park was abolished and the land that it occupied was constituted as a national park and given the name “Belair National Park”.

==History==
Belair was originally inhabited by the Kaurna Aboriginal people. The area was called Pradli, which means “baldness”, because the appearance of the area when looking south from the Adelaide Plains was “bald like the moon.” The first Europeans to set foot in the area were crewmen from the &quot;Coromandel&quot; in 1837. The first European to settle in the area was a squatter, E. Nicholas Foott, who in 1839 dug a well and built a stone cottage, spending £500 despite not holding a title to the land. In 1840, South Australian governor George Gawler set the land aside for a government farm, forcing Foott to leave the land, though he was paid £300 for his improvements to the land (he later became a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly).
Governor Grey arrived in May 1841, with a remit to cut Government expenditure and raise revenue, and announced in the Gazette of 15 July of the intended sale by auction of the land. This, however, did not take place, and in the depression of 1841–1842 a dozen or so unemployed men and their families were allowed to settle there temporarily. In June 1844, four sections at the western end (874, 875, 878 and 882) totalling about were sold. In 1848 a cottage, long since demolished, was erected alongside the creek as a residence for the farm manager, and for occasional use by the Governor. In 1858 a residence, complete with swimming pool, was built as a &quot;summer house&quot; for the Governor, Sir Richard MacDonnell (served 1855–1862), and used by his successors Sir Anthony Musgrave (1873–1877), and Sir William Jervois (1877–1883), until the more imposing edifice at Marble Hill was completed in 1880. Now known as Old Government House, the building is heritage-listed.

From 1874 to 1884 the Government Farm was managed by William Cook (1815–1897), father of Edith Agnes Cook. His eldest daughter Katherine wrote an article on that period of the farm&#x27;s history for the South Australian Archives. His predecessor was Ebenezer Jarvis (c. 1829–1897), who left to take a post as manager of Government House, Adelaide. Two great bushfires occurred during their time; in 1866/1867 and 1877, when many old trees were destroyed. Proposals in 1881 to sell off parts of small portions of the land were opposed by Walter Gooch, James Page and the Australian Natives Association, which led in 1883 to an Act of Parliament prohibiting its sale. In 1888 further agitation by Gooch, Arthur Falconer Robin (1867–1906) and Samuel Dixon of the Royal Society of South Australia led to a parliamentary decision that the Government Farm be established as a public park, and after some delays the National Park Act received the Governor&#x27;s assent in January 1892. Another person given partial credit was William Henry Selway of the Field Naturalists&#x27; Section of the Royal Society.

A nine-hole golf course was constructed in the southwest corner of the park in 1934 in an attempt by the state government to raise money for the park&#x27;s maintenance during the Great Depression. The course was expanded to 18 holes in 1941, redeveloped in the 1970&#x27;s, and sold to a private operator in 1982. The Belair Park Country Club ran the course until it went into administration in January 2018. The state government proposed to repurpose part of the golf course and build a seven-pitch soccer field for the Sturt Lions Football Club, but this proposal met with backlash from the local community during the public consultation period, with more than 8,000 people signing a petition opposing the development. The day after the consultation period ended, Environment Minister David Speirs announced that the plan would not go ahead, and in October 2021, the government announced that high-impact development in the former golf course would be banned and that parts of the land would be re-vegetated and returned to the rest of the park.

In 1985, the Belair National Park was declared as a state heritage area under the &quot;South Australian Heritage Act 1978-1980&quot;. In 1987, the nearby National Park railway station was closed.

===Weed invasion===

The first European people traversed the Belair area in 1837. In 1840, Governor Gawler raised a government farm on which sick horses and bullocks from government departments could be agisted. In 1881, a proposal was put forward for small agricultural holdings and also, the national park was dedicated, making it the first National Park in South Australia. Many exotic and non-indigenous plants were introduced and are now found in the park as weeds. Numerous native plants, such as Cootamundra wattle, have become environmental weeds after being introduced into areas outside their natural range.

The Belair National Park has suffered major disturbance to its natural ecosystems and natural vegetation communities through the accidental invasion of non-indigenous plants as well as the deliberate introduction of exotic and non-indigenous plants to certain zones within the park. In spite of these problems, several remnant stands of rare native plant species endemic to the Mt Lofty Ranges can be found there in season, mostly along tracks in less visited areas of the park&#x27;s walking trail system. Both Donkey Orchids and Spider Orchids are among several diminutive flowers usually seen late winter each year.

A volunteer organisation named Friends of Belair National Park was formed in 1985, aiming to reduce the effect of invasive weeds within the park. The group meets regularly to manually or chemically remove accessible weeds, and also hosts nature walks and other events to increase community engagement with land management.

==Geography==
Belair National Park is situated 13 km south east of Adelaide city centre in South Australia, in the suburb of Belair, and is one of the few remaining areas of relatively undisturbed native vegetation in the Adelaide Hills.

===Walking Trails===


;Wood Duck Dawdle
A short circuit around Playford Lake.
;Lorikeet Loop Walk
A 3 km circuit walk from the main car park to the Adventure Playground.
;Valley Loop Walk
A 3 km circuit walk to Long Gully.
;Microcarpa Walk
A 4 km circuit departing from near Playford Lake.
;Waterfall Hike
A 6.5 km circuit that visits the park&#x27;s waterfalls and travels
to the higher areas away from the recreation areas.
;Yurrebilla Trail
The first 5 km of the Yurrebilla Trail is in the national park. It begins at the Belair railway station and continues toward the Lower Waterfall before departing the
park at the Sheoak Road boundary.

Belairs national park signifies South Australia&#x27;s commitment to preserving the natural areas for both conservation and recreation.

<text>Canunda National Park is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located about southeast of Adelaide, on the coast about southwest of Millicent. It consists of coastal dunes, limestone cliffs, and natural bushland. The beaches can be dangerous, but are popular for beach fishing and 4WD&#x27;s.

The national park consists of two parts - the first part being land in the gazetted localities of Southend and Canunda while the second part is located to the south in the gazetted locality of Carpenter Rocks at the headland of Cape Banks.

From as far back as 10,000 years ago, members of the Boandik group of Indigenous Australians lived in temporary camps along the coast during summer, and for the rest of the year they lived near inland swamps in relatively permanent huts (wurlies).

Much of the national park is accessible only to four wheel drive vehicles and walkers. The national park&#x27;s office is located in the town of Southend at the northernmost end of the park. The northern end of the national park was once part of Mayurra Station. The remnants of Canunda&#x27;s pastoral history can be seen at Coola Outstation.

<doc id="101768" wikidata="Q1106855" url="?curid=101768" title="Coffin Bay National Park">
<text>Coffin Bay National Park is a protected area in on the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia, Australia, which is located about 301 km west of Adelaide and about 46 km west of Port Lincoln. The town of Coffin Bay is near the entrance to the national park. The national park occupies the Coffin Bay Peninsula – a long peninsula with a sheltered bay to its north, coastal dunes, swamps and a coastline which overlooks islands, reefs, limestone cliffs and white surf beaches.

To the east of Point Avoid are Almonta and Gunyah Beaches, used for surfing. Reefs extend out to sea from Point Avoid to Golden Island with Price Island further out. There is a camping area at Yangie Bay with camping fees payable on entry to the National Park. Access to the majority of the park&#x27;s area north of Yangie Bay is via four wheel drive tracks only.

The historic former Coffin Bay Whaling Site at Point Sir Isaac lies within the national park and is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

==Wildlife==
There is a great variety of wildlife in the national park. Many seabirds can be seen including white-bellied sea eagles and ospreys as well as various albatrosses and petrels.

The volunteer organisation Friends of Coffin Bay Parks have worked to re-introduce native plants and eradicate feral animals and weeds.

==Associated protected areas==

===Statutory===
The waters adjoining the coastline of the national park are within the Thorny Passage Marine Park.

===Non-statutory arrangements===
The area covered by the national park is also overlapped by the Coffin Bay Important Bird Area, a non-statutory classification determined by BirdLife International. This particular IBA supports over 1% of the world populations of pied and sooty oystercatchers, as well as significant numbers of fairy terns, hooded plovers, western whipbirds, rock parrots and blue-breasted fairy-wrens.

<doc id="101769" wikidata="Q1129899" url="?curid=101769" title="Coorong National Park">
<text>Coorong National Park is a protected area located in South Australia about south-east of Adelaide, that predominantly covers a coastal lagoon ecosystem officially known as The Coorong and the Younghusband Peninsula on the Coorong&#x27;s southern side. The western end of the Coorong lagoon is at the Murray Mouth near Hindmarsh Island and the Sir Richard Peninsula, and it extends about south-eastwards. Road access is from Meningie. The beach on the coastal side of the peninsula, the longest in Australia, is also commonly called The Coorong.

The Coorong lies within the traditional lands of the Ngarrindjeri people, an Aboriginal Australian group. Notable locations within the park include Salt Creek, Policeman&#x27;s Point, Jack Point, and Woods Well.


==Etymology==
Its name is thought to be a corruption of the Ngarrindjeri word &quot;kurangk&quot;, also written &quot;Kurangh&quot;, meaning a long or narrow lagoon or neck.

==History==
The Coorong National Park was proclaimed on 9 November 1967 under the &quot;National Parks Act 1966&quot; in respect to land in sections 17 and 60 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Glyde and section 6 in the Hundred of Santo.

At the commencement of the &quot;[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 197972) |journal= The South Australian Government Gazette |date= 27 April 1972 |page= 700 |url= http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/num_act/npawa56o1972293/ |access-date= 20 January 2017 |publisher= Government of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coorong Game Reserve which was purchased by the Government of South Australia in 1968 was abolished on 14 January 1993 and its lands was added to the national park. The game reserve occupied part of the Coorong lagoon to the immediate west of [[Salt Creek, South Australia|Salt Creek]] and had an area of as of May 1982.

In February 2013, a lifeboat from &quot;[[MS Oliva]]&quot;, a ship that foundered in the [[South Atlantic]] during 2011, washed up on a beach in the national park.

==Description==
The western end of the Coorong lagoon is at the [[Murray Mouth]] near [[Hindmarsh Island]] and the [[Sir Richard Peninsula]], and it extends about south-east. The national park area includes the Coorong itself, and Younghusband Peninsula which separates the Coorong from [[Gulf St Vincent]] in the [[Southern Ocean]]. The Coorong has been cut off from [[Lake Alexandrina (South Australia)|Lake Alexandrina]] by the construction of the [[Goolwa Barrages]] (weirs) from Goolwa to Pelican Point during the late 1930s.

The national park was formed in 1967 as a sanctuary for many species of birds, animals and fish. It attracts many migratory species. It provides refuge for these animals during some of Australia&#x27;s regular droughts. The also supports coastal dune systems, lagoons and coastal vegetation.

One of the unique aspects of the Coorong is the interaction of water along its length, with sea water and [[Murray River]] water meeting rainfall and groundwater. The freshwater supports the fauna (animal) of the area while the sea water is the habitat for much of the birdlife.

Notable locations within the park include Salt Creek, Policeman&#x27;s Point, Jack Point, and Woods Well.

The waters of the Coorong are a popular venue for recreational and commercial fishers. [[Coorong mullet]], [[mulloway]] and [[bream]] are the main species.

==Beach==
The long sandy beach running down the outer side of the Younghusband Peninsula and commonly referred to as The Coorong, is the longest beach in Australia. It runs from the Murray mouth to [[Cape Jaffa]].

==Cultural significance==
The Coorong is of great cultural significance to the [[Ngarrindjeri|Ngarrindjeri people]], who have [[songline]]s relating to [[creation stories]] associated with the area as well as a long history of living sustainably and looking after the complex environment.

===Camp Coorong===

Camp Coorong is a place of cultural learning, where visitors can learn about Ngarrindjeri culture, history, arts and crafts, including [[basket-weaving]]. It is owned and run by Ngarrindjeri people, and situated about south of [[Meningie, South Australia|Meningie]]. The centre was founded by brothers Tom and George Trevorrow in 1985, with the aim of creating a place where the local community could have camps, younger members of the community might find employment, and Ngarrindjeri culture could be shared. It was officially closed to the public in 2018.

Ngarrindjeri [[Aboriginal Australian elder|elder]] and well-known weaver Aunty [[Ellen Trevorrow]], who is Tom&#x27;s widow, works from one of the rooms at the camp, along with artist and academic Jelina Haines, who was born in the Philippines. Their work has been commissioned for the recently refurbished [[Department for Infrastructure &amp; Transport]] offices in [[Pirie Street]].

== Ecology ==
The wetlands within the part of the national park containing the Coorong Lagoon form a complex [[ecosystem]] of freshwater, [[estuarine]], and [[hypersaline]] waterbodies with a unique diversity of habitats for plants and animals. The coastal lagoons are considered [[IUCN Red List of Ecosystems#Critically endangered (CR)|critically endangered]] due to the loss of freshwater flows, local extinction of characteristic submerged plants and subsequent loss of habitat diversity.

In December 2018, the [[Government of Australia|Federal]] and [[Government of South Australia|South Australian]] governments announced a new [[environmental management]] program called &quot;Healthy Coorong, Healthy Basin&quot;. Ongoing , the Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal Corporation is working with the [[Department for Environment &amp; Water]] to share their knowledge of [[landcare in Australia|landcare]] practices, which will be incorporated in a new database.

==Flora and fauna==
The Coorong is an area of huge natural [[biodiversity]].

===Birds===
The Coorong National Park has been recognised by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]]. It has supported the [[chestnut teal]], [[Australian shelduck]], [[sharp-tailed sandpiper]], [[red-necked stint]], [[banded stilt]], [[red-necked avocet]], [[pied oystercatcher]] and [[red-capped plover]]. [[Australasian bittern]]s have been recorded. It has also supported significant numbers of [[orange-bellied parrot]]s, [[fairy tern]]s and [[hooded plover]]s, although their usage of the site has declined from reduced freshwater inflows.

The largest pelican [[rookery]] in Australia is at Jack Point, just off the [[Princes Highway]] and about north of Salt Creek. The pelicans also breed on North Pelican Island. The Australian pelican (&quot;[[Pelecanus conspicillatus]]&quot;) is the largest species of pelican, and breeds from August until January.

===Marine life===
As mentioned above, [[Coorong mullet]], [[mulloway]] and [[bream]] are the main species caught for human consumption in the Coorong.

==In the arts==
The park was the setting of the popular 1976 film &quot;[[Storm Boy (1976 film)|Storm Boy]]&quot;, as well as its [[Storm Boy (2019 film)|2019 remake]]. Both films are based on [[Storm Boy (novel)|the 1964 novel]] by [[Colin Thiele]] of the same name set on the Coorong that portrays the bond of a young boy who rescues and raises an extraordinary orphaned pelican which he names Mr Percival.

[[Lucy Treloar]]&#x27;s award-winning novel, &quot;Salt Creek&quot; (2015), is set in the Coorong, specifically the area around [[Salt Creek, South Australia|Salt Creek]], in 1855.

<text>Flinders Chase National Park (formerly Flinders Chase) is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located at the west end of Kangaroo Island about west-south west of the state capital of Adelaide and west of the municipal seat of Kingscote. It is a sanctuary for endangered species and home to a few geological phenomena. It was the second national park to be declared in South Australia.

Flinders Chase National Park consists of three sections - an area of coastal landscapes around Cape du Couedic in the south west corner of the island, the Gosse Lands in the centre of the west end of the island and the former Cape Borda Lightstation reserve in the north west corner of the island.

==Description==
===Location===
Flinders Chase National Park is located at the north-western end of Kangaroo Island in South Australia approximately west of Kingscote. It is located within the gazetted localities of Flinders Chase, Gosse and Karatta.

===Extent===
As of 1993, the national park consists of three separate parcels of land:

*&quot;Cape du Couedic&quot; which is refers to the main parcel of land within the national park and which is bounded at the north by the West Bay Road and the West Melrose Track, to the east by the West End Highway and an unsealed track called the Sand Dune Track; and the portion of coastline extending from West Bay in the west to Cape du Couedic in the south and to Sanderson Bay in the east. This portion of the national park includes the following islands - Paisley Islet (also known as West Bay Island) at West Bay and the Casuarina Islets immediately south of Cape du Couedic.
*The Gosse Lands - a parcel of land which is bounded by the Playford Highway to the north and the West End Highway to the west.
*The former lighthouse reserve at Cape Borda.

===Protected area designation===
The national park is classified as an IUCN category II protected area.

==History==

Following a deputation of scientists in 1906, the premier, Tom Price, agreed to set aside the Cape Borda lighthouse reserve of 61 square miles as a nature reserve. and in 1909 the South Australian government converted another 79 square miles of what had been pastoral reserve to a nature reserve, under the control of the Fauna and Flora Board. The board had asked for 300 square miles but the additional properties needed had already been leased, and the lessees, who had yet to make any improvements, demanded £28,000 as compensation for losing what they had been getting for £28 per year Professor Stirling urged that when those leases expired they be turned over to the Board.

The reserve was named Flinders Chase at the suggestion of Samuel Dixon (died 1927).
Apart from its intended use as a habitat for koalas and other mammals, it was considered a likely refuge for the lyre bird, &quot;pheasant&quot; (perhaps the malleefowl, [&quot;Leipoa ocellata&quot;]) and &quot;bush turkey&quot; (perhaps Australian brushturkey, [&quot;Alectura lathami&quot;]), all threatened on the mainland due to depredations by foxes. The Rocky River was touted as a platypus reserve.

Parts of the national park first acquired protected area status as a &#x27;flora and fauna reserve&#x27; declared on 16 October 1919 under the &quot;Fauna and Flora Reserve Act 1919&quot;, an act whose specific purpose was:…to establish a Reserve on Kangaroo Island for the Protection, Preservation, and Propagation of Australasian Fauna and Flora, and to provide for the Control of such Reserve, and for other purposes.
No funds were made available for fencing or provision of a ranger however, and the laws regarding burning, shooting, poisoning and taking of protected species were unenforceable and broken with impunity.
In 1922 the government brought the Chase&#x27;s total area close to by the addition of the Rocky River freehold and leases south of Rocky River to the landing reserve by the Cape du Couedic lighthouse. The Chase&#x27;s eastern boundary was now a straight line running south from the De Mole River mouth to the island&#x27;s south coast. It also gave the board a couple of cottages for the use of a ranger and visitors.

It was constituted as a national park upon the proclamation of the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; on 27 April 1972 which repealed five items of existing legislation including the &quot;Fauna and Flora Reserve Act 1919&quot;. At proclamation in 1972, it consisted of the following land in the following cadastral units as well as the entirety of the Casuarina Islets - section 11 in the Hundred of Borda, section 64 in the Hundred of Gosse, section 17 in the Hundred of McDonald and section 66 in &quot;South out of Hundreds&quot;.

On 15 October 1993, land in section 11 of the Hundred of Borda, section 64 of Hundred of Gosse and Allotments 50 and 52 in DP 38340 and with an area of was removed from the national park and constituted under the &quot;Wilderness Protection Act 1992&quot; as the Ravine des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area.

==Sanctuary==
Since creation in November 1919, it has become a sanctuary for endangered species, some of them introduced from the mainland in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s, 23 additional species were introduced, including koalas (1923) and platypus (1928). Most of these species can still be observed today. Kangaroos, goannas and echidnas are commonly seen in the national park.

=== Little penguins ===
Little penguins have been recorded in Flinders Chase in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. It is believed that these colonies have since gone extinct, partly due to the increase of long-nosed fur seal populations after the end of commercial sealing. In 1886, little penguins were seen at Admiral&#x27;s Arch.

==Geological monuments==
The national park contains two geological features that have been listed as geological monuments by the Geological Society of Australia: Cape du Couedic and Remarkable Rocks.

Remarkable Rocks are naturally sculptured formations precariously balanced atop a granite outcrop. They remind visitors of the sculptures of Henry Moore.

==Fire==
Lightning strikes on Thursday 6 December 2007 caused approximately of land in both the national park and the adjoining Ravine des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area to be burnt, before being brought under control ten days later. The national park was again damaged during the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, with the Visitor Centre completely destroyed.

<text>The Ikara–Flinders Ranges National Park, formerly Flinders Ranges National Park, is a national park situated approximately north of Adelaide. It lies northeast of the small town of Hawker, in the northern central part of South Australia&#x27;s largest mountain range, the Flinders Ranges, and covers an area of between Hawker and Blinman. It is known for the land formation known as Wilpena Pound, while other well-known features include the Heysen Range and the Brachina and Bunyeroo gorges. The Heysen Trail and Mawson Trail pass through the park.

==History==

For millennia, the Adnyamathanha people have inhabited the Flinders Ranges. On 12 February 2016 the park was renamed to include the Adnyamathanha word, &quot;Ikara&quot;, &quot;meeting place&quot;, referring to the traditional name for Wilpena Pound.

==Geology==
The Flinders Ranges are largely composed of folded and faulted sediments of the Adelaide Geosyncline. This very thick sequence of sediments were deposited in a large basin during the Neoproterozoic on the passive margin of the ancient continent of Rodinia. During the Cambrian, approximately 540 million years ago, the area underwent the Delamerian orogeny where the geosynclinal sequence was folded and faulted into a large mountain range. Since this time the area has undergone erosion resulting in the relatively low ranges today.

Most of the high ground and ridgetops in the Flinders are sequences of quartzites that outcrop along strike. The high walls of Wilpena Pound are formed by the outcropping beds of the eponymous Pound Quartzite in a synclinal structure. The same formation forms many of the other high parts of the Flinders, including the high plateau of the Gammon Ranges and the Heysen Range. Cuesta forms are also very common in the Flinders.

==Features and accessibility==
The park lies around } north of Adelaide city centre, and covers , between Hawker and Blinman.

The park&#x27;s most characteristic landmark is Wilpena Pound, a large, sickle-shaped, natural amphitheatre covering nearly , containing the range&#x27;s highest peak, St Mary Peak (). The Heysen Range is within the park. There are many lookouts, scenic vistas, small canyons, and unusual rock formations located in the park, including Brachina Gorge, Bunyeroo Gorge, Arkaroo Rock, Wilkawillina Gorge, and Hucks Lookout. The park has some stone ruins from early European settlement and Aboriginal rock art sites. A rock formation called the Great Wall of China is located just outside the park.

The park centre at Wilpena Pound is accessible by sealed road from Hawker. Other areas in the park can be reached by unsealed roads, which are mostly accessible by two-wheel drive vehicles except in bad weather or after heavy rain. Camping is permitted at many locations in the park.

The park is co-managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia, which is part of the Department for Environment and Water, and the Adnyamathanha Traditional Lands Association (since 2011).

==Flora and fauna==
The flora of the Flinders Ranges is composed largely of species adapted to a semi-arid environment such as cypress-pine, mallee, and black oak. Moister areas near Wilpena Pound support grevilleas, Guinea flowers, lilies and ferns. Reeds and sedges grow near permanent water sources such as springs and waterholes.

Since the eradication of dingos and the establishment of permanent waterholes for stock, the numbers of red kangaroos, western grey kangaroos and euros in the Flinders Ranges have increased. The yellow-footed rock-wallaby, which neared extinction after the arrival of Europeans due to hunting and predation by foxes, has now stabilized. Other endemic marsupials include dunnarts, planigales. Efforts to reintroduce the western quoll and the brushtail possum in the park have been ongoing since 2014. Echidnas are the sole monotreme species in the park. Insectivorous bats make up significant proportion of mammals in the area. Reptiles include goannas, snakes, dragon lizards, skinks and geckos. The streambank froglet is an endemic amphibian.

===Birds===
There are a large number of bird species including various parrots, emus, the wedge-tailed eagles and small numbers of waterbirds. The land within the national park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it contains an apparently sustainable population of the range-restricted short-tailed grasswren.

==Heritage listings==
There are a number of heritage-listed sites within the national park:
* Eddie Pumpa Outstation
* Hayward Homestead Ruins
* Impact Ejecta Horizon Late Precambrian Shales Geological Site
* Enorama Mail Station and Rubbish Dump

<text>Gawler Ranges National Park is a protected area lying north-west of Adelaide in the northern Eyre Peninsula of South Australia. It is known for its spectacular rock formations.

==History==
The national park originated as the Paney Station pastoral lease, which was acquired in 2000 by the South Australian Government with assistance from the Australian Government. In 2001 some of the adjacent Scrubby Peak Station was acquired and added to the national park.

==Access==
The national park is north of Wudinna, north-east of Minnipa and is accessible using high ground clearance two wheel drive vehicles via the gravel roads from Kimba, Wudinna or Minnipa.

Camping is permissible and encouraged at several campgrounds. Although some have toilets, there are minimal other facilities and visitors are encouraged to take adequate food, water, fuel and firewood with them.

==Features==

Historic sites in the national park include the Old Paney Homestead, the Policemans Point precinct, Stone Dam, and Pondanna Outstation, where agriculture was attempted in the early 20th century. Notable landmarks are Paney Bluff, Mount Allalone, Mount Sturt, Conical Hill and Scrubby Peak. Other scenic sites are Kolay Mirica Falls, the Organ Pipes and Yandinga Gorge.

==Environment==
Some 21 rare and endangered animal and plant species including the yellow-footed rock-wallaby can be found in the national park. Another larger mammal is the southern hairy-nosed wombat. Some 140 species of birds have been recorded in the national park. The area covered by the national park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of the vulnerable malleefowl, the Gawler Ranges subspecies of the short-tailed grasswren, rufous treecreeper, blue-breasted fairy-wren, purple-gaped honeyeater and western yellow robin.

<text>Dhilba Guuranda–Innes National Park, formerly Innes National Park, is an IUCN-designated protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located on the southwest tip of Yorke Peninsula about west of the state capital of Adelaide. It is a popular destination for camping, bushwalking, fishing, surfing and scuba diving.

==History==
===Prior use of the land===

The Narungga people occupied the Yorke Peninsula for thousands of years. They consisted of four clans, the Kurnara of the north, the Windera of the east, the Wari of the West and the Dilpa of the south. They are the traditional owners of the land, and have strong cultural links to it, with some sites having particular spiritual significance.

European colonisation of the area began in 1846 with sheep grazing near Cape Spencer. Crops were grown on a small scale in the 19th and early 20th century. Innes National Park was named after William Innes, who discovered commercial quantities of gypsum in the early 1900s and founded the mining town of Inneston in 1913, which had a population of around 500 at its peak. Gypsum was mined until 1930 when the Great Depression made it uneconomical, and in 1970 the town and surrounding land was sold to the South Australian government, creating Innes National Park. Some gypsum mining still continues at nearby Marion Bay.

===National park===
The national park was declared on 5 March 1970 under the &quot;National Parks Act 1966&quot; as the Innes National Park, to &quot;conserve important habitat for the western whipbird, the mallee fowl and to protect a number of heritage buildings at Inneston&quot;. Land was added to the national park in 1977, 1984 and 1993 in order to deal with increased recreational use. 

It was renamed as the Dhilba Guuranda–Innes National Park on 14 November 2020 in recognition of a co-management agreement signed by the Government of South Australia and the Narungga people.

Some of the buildings at Inneston have been restored and are available as basic hire accommodation.

==Description==
===Location===

Dhilba Guuranda–Innes National Park is located on the southern western extremity of Yorke Peninsula in South Australia about by road from the Adelaide city centre. It is located within the locality officially known as Inneston.

===Extent===
The national park occupies most of the land on the south-western tip of Yorke Peninsula south west of a line running from Willyama Bay on the south coast of the peninsula near Marion Bay to Gym Beach on the west coast of the peninsula and the following four islands immediately adjoining the coastline (from east to west): Chinamans Hat Island, Middle Island and South Island west of Pondalowie Bay, and Royston Island immediately west of Royston Head.

Within the above area, land excluded from the national park includes the following saline lakes which were associated with gypsum mining at the time of proclamation of the national park - Marion Lake, Snow Lake and Spider Lake.

As of 2014, the national park included the following &quot;no access&quot; areas (from east to west) - a section of coastline between Cape Spencer and Ethel Beach, South and Middle Islands at the entrance to Pondalowie Bay, Royston Island, the coastline between Royston Head and Dolphin Beach, and the coastline between Browns Beach and Gym Beach.

===Physical landscape===

The coastline extending from Willyama Bay to Cape Spencer consists of a number of bays such as Cable Bay and Stenhouse Bay with some prominent headlands such as Rhino Head and a line of cliffs between Cable Bay and Stenhouse Bay. From Cape Spencer to West Cape, an unbroken line of cliffs ranging in height between and with some sandy beaches at their feet make up the south west coast of Yorke Peninsula. From West Cape to Pondalowie Bay, the cliff line is of a relatively lower height. From the south end of Pondalowie Bay to Gym Beach, areas of sand dunes dominate the shoreline and the land immediately adjoining it with the exception of Royston Head and the cliff line extending eastward to Dolphin Beach. The land between the national park&#x27;s boundary and the road system is dominated in part by a network of saline lakes.

===Road system===
The national park is serviced by a road connected to the western end of the Yorke Highway which passes through Marion Bay. The road which starts at Stenhouse Bay follows the coastline as a sealed road passing Chinamans Hat Island, Cable Bay and the turn-offs to Cape Spencer, Ethel Beach, West Cape and two camping grounds at Pondalowie Bay. The road concludes as a sealed road at the turn-off to the Pondalowie Surf Break Carpark. It continues as an unsealed road, passing turn-offs to Dolphin Beach and Shell Beach, to terminate at Browns Beach in the north west of the national park. Gym Beach in the extreme north west, while being accessible via the national park&#x27;s walking trail system can only reached via vehicle from the Marion Bay Road which is located to the east of the national park&#x27;s boundary.

==Protected areas==
The national park is classified as an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category II protected area.

The waters adjoining the coastline of the national park including the four islands are within a habitat protection zone in the Southern Spencer Gulf Marine Park, a statutory designation.

The national park is within the extent of an Important Bird Area known as the Southern Yorke Peninsula Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of mallee fowl as well as of other threatened bird species such as the western whipbird.

==Flora and fauna==
===Flora===
As of 2003, 333 species of native plants had been recorded in Dhilba Guuranda–Innes National Park of which 115 species were of conservation significance including 24 scheduled in the South Australian &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; and the following four species listed in the Australian &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;: annual candles, winter spider-orchid, bead samphire and splendid bush-pea.

===Fauna===

As of 2003, the following animals were recorded within the park:

* Native mammals included New Zealand fur seal, western pygmy possum, Gould&#x27;s wattle bat, chocolate wattled bat, common dolphin, southern right whale, western grey kangaroo, Australian sea lion, short-beaked echidna and bottlenose dolphin.

* Birds included 111 species of native bird, of which 13 species were scheduled in Australian and state legislation. The following 13 species were listed in the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; either as being vulnerable or rare species - chestnut quail-thrush, eastern reef egret, fairy tern, hooded plover, little tern, malleefowl, osprey, painted button-quail, peregrine falcon, rock parrot, shy heathwren, western whipbird and white-bellied sea-eagle while the malleefowl was also recognised nationally as a vulnerable species under the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;.

* Reptiles included marbled gecko, mallee snake-eye, painted dragon, barking gecko, yellow-faced whipsnake, black tiger snake, eastern stone gecko, eastern bearded dragon, bull skink, eastern brown snake, four-toed earless skink, peninsula brown snake, southern four-toed slider, common scaly-foot, common dwarf skink, western bluetongue, Adelaide snake-eye, sleepy lizard and prickly dragon.

* Introduced animals included rock dove, cat, rabbit, house mouse, house sparrow, black rat, common starling and fox.

After steps were taken to eradicate pests and fence off the tip of the Yorke Peninsula in a project initially (2019) called the Great Southern Ark and later Marna Banggara, species reintroduction has begun. Brush-tailed bettongs, or woylies, were the first species reintroduced in the area, with the first 40 individuals translocated from Wedge Island, in June 2021. The woylies were the first of about 20 locally extinct species which are to be moved there by around 2040. In July 2022, another 36 woylies were translocated, this time from Western Australia, with the permission of the Noongar traditional custodians, in a move that will boost genetic diversity.

==Natural and cultural heritage==

The national park was listed on the former Register of the National Estate because of its natural and European heritage.

===Natural heritage===
The following three lakes which support a population of stromatolites are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register maintained by the South Australian Government: Deep Lake, Inneston Lake and Marion Lake.

===Aboriginal heritage===
As of 2003, 21 sites of significance to the Narungga people had been identified. These consisted of &quot;burial sites&quot; and a broad classification known as &quot;archaeological sites&quot;.

=== European heritage ===

====Mining====
The following two sites at Inneston and Stenhouse Bay associated with the mining of gypsum are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register - the &quot;Inneston Gypsum Complex&quot; and the Stenhouse Bay Jetty.

====Shipwrecks====

At least four shipwrecks which are located within the national park or immediately adjoining its coastal boundary are protected under Australian and state historic shipwrecks legislation, that is the &quot;Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018&quot; (Cwth) and the &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981&quot; (SA).

* SS &quot;Marion&quot; which run aground to the immediate east of Chinamans Hat Island during 1862.

* The barque &quot;Ethel&quot;, which run aground on the coastline between West Cape and Cape Spencer on a beach now known as Ethel Beach during 1904. The remains of the Ethel lie parallel to the shore below the cliff at Ethel Beach. For many years the hull was largely intact, deteriorating gradually with every storm. A severe gale in 1988 caused the hull to completely collapse, leaving the iron frame as the most identifiable feature of the site. The wreck is mostly covered by sand, sometimes revealed more during storms.

* SS &quot;Ferret&quot; which run aground in 1920 on what is now Ethel Beach.

* &quot;Hougomont&quot; which was scuttled in 1932 to form a breakwater lies close to the coastline near Stenhouse Bay.

==Services and attractions==

===Camping===
Camping grounds are available at the following locations (from east to west) - Stenhouse Bay, Cable Bay, Pondalowie Bay (three sites including one for caravans and trailers), Shell Beach, Browns Beach and Gym Beach.

===Indoor accommodation===
Indoor accommodation is available at three locations - a number of restored buildings at Inneston, the Stenhouse Bay hall and a cottage at Shell Beach.

===Walking===
A system of trails allows visitors to the national park to enjoy views of the coastline and adjoining waters and to observe flora and fauna including species such as southern right whales and dolphins and features such as lighthouses and heritage sites. As of 2014, there are three major walking trails - the Thomson Pfitzner Plaster Trail Hike that connects Stenhouse Bay and Inneston, the Royston Head Hike from Dolphin Beach to Royston Head and the Gym Beach Hike which connects Browns Beach and Gym Beach. A number of minor trails connect the road system to locations such as Cape Spencer, Ethel Beach, West Cape and Pondalowie Bay.

===Surfing===
The main surf break at Pondalowie is a popular quality wave. It consists of a combination left and right peak that breaks over a reef and sand bottom. The left is good up to about . The right starts to become good from between and plus. A second smaller right-hand reef break known as &quot;Richard&#x27;s Reef&quot; is located further north along the beach. It was named in honour of Richard Thomas, a long-time local surfer and resident of the area. Not far from Stenhouse Bay is a break known as &quot;Chinaman&#x27;s&quot;. This is a powerful and hollow left-hand reef break which breaks in shallow water and washes over a rock shelf. It is a high quality wave that is suitable only for skilled surfers, and caution should be used when surfing here.

<text>Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park (formerly Lake Eyre National Park) is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia. It is located 697 km north of the state capital of Adelaide within the gazetted locality of Lake Eyre. It contains both the North and South sections of Lake Eyre as well as sections of the Tirari Desert.

The national park protects dry desert landscapes, the nation&#x27;s largest salt lake and the lowest point on the mainland. As of 2012, the national park has been subject to a co-management agreement between the Arabana aboriginal people and the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR). The national park almost encloses Elliot Price Conservation Park, which covers the Hunt Peninsula and Brooks Island, within and around the northern section of the lake. It was established as South Australia&#x27;s first arid zone conservation zone. It was named after Elliot Price, from the nearby Muloorina Station. There is limited vehicle access to the park.

The national park was renamed as Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park on 14 November 2013.

The national park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.

<doc id="101778" wikidata="Q570270" url="?curid=101778" title="Lake Gairdner National Park">
<text>Lake Gairdner National Park is a protected area associated with Lake Gairdner in South Australia (Australia), 436 km northwest of Adelaide. It is located just south of the Trans-Australian Railway, Stuart Highway, and the Woomera Prohibited area.

The national park consists of the following salt lakes (from east to west) - Lake Gairdner, Lake Harris and Lake Everard. Ordinarily, the country is totally arid, and devoid of free water, surface or underground. In the summer, it can be extremely hot. In the springtime, however, this country has great attraction for birdwatchers and botanists.

There is generally very limited public access to this park, which is surrounded by pastoral leases. The easiest public access is from the main road running from Yardea to Kingoonya, at The Brothers Well, a concrete catchment at the side of the road at the southern end of Moonaree Station (though the road signs would have you believe that you were on Yardea Station). The road is dirt, but quite good enough for two-wheel drive vehicles unless it is wet, when it is likely that it will be closed by the Highways Dept..

This region is the home country of the Kokatha people, and traces of their occupation may still be found: sacred sites are still visited for ceremonies. The national park also contains the historic Glenloth Gold Battery Site, located at its western end on the shore of Lake Harris, which is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register as a designated place of archaeological significance.

<text>Lake Torrens National Park is a protected area located in South Australia about north of the Adelaide city centre. Material published by the national park&#x27;s manager reports that:
 The stark wilderness and the salt lake that stretches 250km in length make up the Lake Torrens National Park. Lake Torrens is usually a dry salt flat. It has only been filled with water once in the past 150 years. Thunderstorms occasionally provide a small amount of water in the lake, when this occurs the area attracts a variety of birdlife. The park&#x27;s landscape provides opportunities for photography and studying geology.

The national park is located on land which is listed in the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia under the name &quot;Inland Saline Lakes&quot;. The national park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.

<doc id="101781" wikidata="Q920056" url="?curid=101781" title="Lincoln National Park">
<text>Lincoln National Park is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located about west of the state capital of Adelaide and about south of the municipal seat of Port Lincoln. It consists of a mainland area on the Jussieu Peninsula on the south eastern tip of Eyre Peninsula and a number of nearby islands. The national park contains significant sites of natural, indigenous and early European heritage.

==Description==

Lincoln National Park is located on the Jussieu Peninsula on the south-eastern tip of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia as well as an adjoining portion of Eyre Peninsula and a number of islands adjoining the coastline. The part of the national park located on Jussieu Peninsula is located within the gazetted localities of Lincoln National Park and Sleaford.

===Jussieu Peninsula===

Lincoln National Park occupies the majority of Jussieu Peninsula. The remainder of the Jussieu Peninsula is occupied by the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. The western gateway to the national park is via the isthmus which connects the Jussieu Peninsula to the mainland. The Sleaford Mere Conservation Park abuts the western border of the national park. Land-based park entry is made by road at both the northern and southern sides of the isthmus. The south road is 4WD access only.

The northern coastline of the peninsula curls northward to Cape Donington, where the Cape Donington Lighthouse is situated. Cape Donington is the southern point at the mouth of Port Lincoln, the large, sheltered deep water harbor on which the city of Port Lincoln is located. The eastern coast of the national park which faces onto Spencer Gulf extends from Cape Donington to Taylor&#x27;s Landing (opposite Taylor Island).

The southern boundary of the national park curls southward from Mary Ellis Wreck Beach in the west to the east side of Jussieu Bay in the east. The coastline varies from extensive sand dunes behind Sleaford Bay to limestone cliffs on the east side of Jussieu Bay. The seas in this exposed area are very rough, with dangerous rips leading to numerous drownings.

===Islands===
Lincoln National Park includes the following islands which are located in the waters adjoining the Jussieu Peninsula:
* Bicker Isles and Horse Rock in the body of water known as Port Lincoln.
* Rabbit Island (in Louth Bay), Donington Island, Carcase Rock, an unnamed island in Shag Cove, Owen Island, and an unnamed islet south of Taylor Island in Spencer Gulf.
* Curta Rocks, Liguanea Island and Albatross Island (immediately south of Thistle Island) in the Great Australian Bight.

===Protected area designation===
The national park is classified as an IUCN category II protected area

==History==
On 28 August 1941, land in sections 2, 5, 6, and 13 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Flinders was dedicated under the &quot;Crown Lands Act 1929&quot; as a &quot;Flora and Fauna Reserve&quot;. On 9 November 1967, land in sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13 and 14 in the Hundred of Flinders was proclaimed as the &quot;Lincoln National Park&quot; under the &quot;National Parks Act 1966&quot;.

On 27 April 1972, the national park was reconstituted under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; in respect to the following land - &quot;Hundred Flinders, Section 2, 3, 5, 6, 12-14, Smith Island, Hopkins Island, Lewis Island, Little Island, Owen Island, Albatross Island, Liguanea Island, Rabbit Island (being section 395, North out of Hundreds), Curta Rocks (and) Hundred Flinders, Section 4.&quot;

In the years 1972–1992, the national park increased in size by the addition of land at Stamford Hill (whose original Barngarla name was &quot;Gaidyaba&quot;), Cape Donington, Wanna and many of the islands adjoining the coast of the Jussieu Peninsula. The Lincoln Conservation Reserve which was proclaimed in 1993 under the &quot;Crown Lands Act&quot; 1929, was added to the national park&#x27;s management regime and subsequently removed after the declaration of the reserve as the Lincoln Conservation Park. In June 1999, the boundary of the national park was extended down to Mean Low Water Mark.

In 2004, a parcel of land consisting of land around Memory Cove and the following islands - Hopkins, Lewis, Little, Smith and Williams, was excised from the national park and established as a separate protected area under the &quot;Wilderness Protection Act 1992&quot; (SA) and with the name, the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area.

==Prior use of the land==
===Indigenous use===
The Aboriginal tribes of Barngarla and Nauo were the first people to have lived in the region. Archaeological digs have found sites of stone working, including fish traps, and middens throughout the national park.

===European discovery===
The coastline of Jussieu Peninsula and the adjoining islands was first visited by European explorers in 1802 when the British navigator, Matthew Flinders visited in 1802 followed by the Baudin expedition to Australia later in that year. A stone obelisk monument known as the Flinders Monument was dedicated at Stamford Hill in 1844 by Sir John Franklin in tribute to Flinders&#x27; achievements and is listed as a state heritage place on the South Australian Heritage Register.

===Early European settlement===
Subsequent to the survey by Flinders, the land was settled by a small number of Europeans, mainly along Cape Donington (named after the birthplace of Flinders), where the first grain crop was sown in 1875. Other industries that occurred in the early parts of European settlement were woodcutting, grazing and guano mining. Donington cottage, which still stands and is accessible to the public, is a relic of that era. The Cape Donington Lighthouse was built in 1905. A hexagonal concrete tower, it stands 32 m high and is still in operation. On 5 April 1907 the ketch &quot;Mary Ellis&quot;, on its way from Port Adelaide to Venus Bay, got caught in a gale and was wrecked on a beach along Sleaford Bay, now named Mary Ellis Wreck Beach. Despite total destruction of the ship, no casualties were recorded.

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora===
The national park is largely covered by coastal mallee eucalypts around outcrops of granite. The sand dunes on the southern coastline have smaller shrub coverage.

===Fauna===
The national park is home to a number of resident as well as migratory bird and animal species. Numerous kangaroos, wallabies and emus reside in the national park. Feral foxes were once common in the national park, endangering the existence of many native animals, however after an extensive baiting and culling program, their numbers have diminished. With the reduction in fox numbers, a rebound in goanna and bush stone curlew populations have been recorded. Brush-tailed bettongs and malleefowl have been reintroduced in the national park and are now becoming common.

Migratory birds such as stints and sandpipers spend summer in the national park as part of their seasonal migrations from places as distant as the Arctic Circle and Siberia. Southern right whales are visible in the water surrounding the national park during their seasonal migrations between July and November and Australian sea lions can be seen on rocks and small islands off the coast.

==Visitor attractions and services==
The national park hosts a range of activities including bushwalking, four-wheel driving, camping, snorkelling, scuba diving, swimming and fishing.

===Walking trails===
As of 2010, a total of 19 bushwalking trails with a length of over were available within the national park. The trail system is also part of a regional walking trail known as the Investigator Trail which extends outside of both the national park and the Jussieu Peninsula to North Shields via Tulka and Port Lincoln.

===Four-wheel drive tracks===
Much of the national park is only accessible via four-wheel drive tracks including the Sleaford to Wanna sand dune track.

===Accommodation===
Accommodation consists of one building at Spalding Cove, four formal camping grounds at Fisherman&#x27;s Point, September Beach, Surfleet Cove and Taylor&#x27;s Landing, and eight unserviced camping grounds.

<text>Mount Remarkable National Park is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located about north of the state capital of Adelaide and east of Port Augusta. It is also the name of the highest peak in the park, with a height of .

On 26 November 2021, a non-contiguous portion of the park to the south of the park, known as the Napperby Block, was combined with several other conservation parks to create the new Wapma Thura–Southern Flinders Ranges National Park.

==History==
Land associated with the Park at Mambray Creek and Alligator Gorge first obtained protected area status in 1952 as &#x27;national pleasure resorts&#x27; declared under the then &quot;National Pleasure Resorts Act 1914&quot;. They were managed by the South Australian Government Tourist Bureau from 1952 to 1967.

In 1964, the National Parks Commission submitted a proposal to the Government of South Australia for &quot;comprehensive national parks&quot; covering an area larger than that of the existing national pleasure resorts. This resulted in the creation of three separate reserves - the Alligator Gorge Wildlife Reserve, the Mambray Creek Wildlife Reserve and the Mount Remarkable Wildlife Reserve, that were respectively constituted in July 1965, September 1967 and March 1966.

In 1972, the three wildlife reserves were re-proclaimed under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; as the Mount Remarkable National Park. Between 1972 and 1993, the park doubled in size from an area of by the addition of land including the Black Range Lookout and the Bluff in 1976, and by the addition of an &quot;area west of Alligator Gorge containing The Battery&quot;, two parts of the Willowie Forest Reserve, and the Napperby Block in 1993. The Napperby Block consists of of land, and is non-contiguous to the park. Instead, it is located on the other (southern) side of the Telowie Gorge Conservation Park, immediately east of the town of Napperby, about south of Telowie Gorge and about north-east of the city of Port Pirie.

In 2000, further land was added to the park, which was subsequently named The Warren Bonython Link in honour of Warren Bonython’s &quot;long personal interest in the area&quot; and &quot;his association with the National Parks Foundation&quot;. The park had a total area of after this addition.

On 26 November 2021, the Napperby Block was combined with the former Telowie Gorge Conservation Park, Wirrabara Range Conservation Park and Spaniards Gully Conservation to form the Wapma Thura–Southern Flinders Ranges National Park.

==Description==

The national park consists of two separate areas. The first is the parcel of land (often called a &quot;block&quot;) located immediately west of the town of Melrose and consists of three areas: the Warren Bonython Link, Mambray Creek and Mount Remarkable. This block occupies .

The second parcel of land is known as the Telowie Block and has an area of . It is located on the west side of the old Telowie Gorge Conservation Park (now part of Wapma Thura–Southern Flinders Ranges National Park) about east of the town of Port Germein and about south of the block located at Melrose.

Its area was including the Napperby Block (that is, until 26 November 2021).

The park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.

==Flora and fauna==
It is filled with a wide variety of reptiles, mammals and birds such as goannas, emus, echidna and kookaburras. It is home to 117 native bird species, including Australian ringnecks and wedge-tailed eagles. 
Unique mixture of arid and temperate flora intermixing within the region makes Mount Remarkable a biodiversity hotspot. Temperate trees common in the Great Dividing Range such as White Box, Long Leaved Box, Grey Box and South Australian Blue Gum (&quot;Eucalyptus leucoxylon pruinosa&quot;) have a presence here. The unique Sugar Gum is a forest forming eucalypt that is a relict tree of wetter times in South Australia. The Flinders Ranges variety of Sugar Gum is &quot;Eucalyptus cladocalyx petila&quot;. Capable of growing to 40 metres tall, along with Long Leaved Box it forms the most northerly biome of open forest in South Australia.

Rusty Pods (&quot;Hovea purpurea&quot;), a bush with beautiful purple pea flowers, is another plant that is otherwise only found in the higher parts of the Great Dividing Range. It can be commonly found only along Mt Remarkable Range; with a few outliers in Wirrabara forest, Mount Brown and Mt Aleck.

The Southern Flinders Ranges also form a geographical barrier between semi-arid plants in the eastern and western halves of Australia.

<text>Murray River National Park is a protected area in South Australia located between and north east of the Adelaide city centre, lying along the Murray River. The national park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area. the national park comprises more than , and includes a vast network of Murray River wetlands and floodplains.

The national park was proclaimed on 20 June 1991 under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot;, &quot;to conserve a significant proportion of South Australia’s floodplain environments which are not represented widely in other reserve systems&quot;.

The national park originally consisted of the first three sections listed below, with the following three in existence (six in total) . All of the sections adjoin the Murray River, extending from near Loxton in the south west to near Renmark in the north-east.
* Katarapko (), on the north side of the river between Loxton in the south and Berri in the north
* Lyrup Flats (), on the north side of the river midway between Berri and Loxton
* Bulyong, or Bulyong Island, on the west side of the river upstream from Renmark, accessible only by boat
* Paringa Paddock (), including Goat Island, between Renmark and Paringa
* Gurra Gurra (), just across the river south of Berri, directly opposite Katarapko
* Kingston-on-Murray (), next to the township of Kingston-on-Murray

Katarapko section includes the Ngak Indau Wetland trail, with a bird hide;and the Rilli Island, Media Island, and Kapunda Island Conservation Parks are also part of Katarapko.

The protected areas provide for a number recreational activities such as walking, bike riding, canoeing, bird-watching and bush camping. There are parking facilities, designated camping areas with some toilets, walking trails, and a self-guided drive trail.

In 2021, a group of people in the Riverland region started a campaign to rename Goat Island to Ruby Hunter Island to honour the legacy of singer-songwriter Ruby Hunter. As Goat Island is part of the Murray River National Park, the Department for Environment and Water has the final say.

<text>Naracoorte Caves National Park is a national park near Naracoorte in the Limestone Coast tourism region in the south-east of South Australia (Australia). It was officially recognised in 1994 for its extensive fossil record when the site was inscribed on the World Heritage List, along with Riversleigh. The park preserves 6 km2 of remnant vegetation, with 26 caves contained within the 3.05 km2 World Heritage Area. Out of the 28 known caves in the park, only four are open to the public. Other caves are kept away from the public eye as they are important for scientific research and also for the protection of the caves and their contents. Many of the caves contain spectacular stalactites and stalagmites.

==History ==
===European discovery===
The caves, which are located within the boundaries of what is now the national park, were first encountered in 1845 with the discovery of Blanche Cave.

===Naracoorte Forest Reserve===
In 1885, the Department of Woods and Forests appointed a caretaker due to &quot;the popularity of the caves and their vulnerability to vandalism&quot;.

=== First fossil collection ===
The first recorded collection of Pleistocene megafaunal fossils from the caves was a 1908 collection reported by William Reddan from Specimen Cave. This collection was carried out largely without regard for the stratigraphic context of the fossils, limiting the collections scientific utility.

===National Pleasure Resort===
In 1916, the control of the portion of the forest reserve which contained many of the caves and which consisted of about of land was transferred from the Department of Woods and Forests to the Immigration, Publicity and Tourist Bureau who would manage it as a national pleasure resort under the &quot;National Pleasure Resort Act 1914&quot; until 1972. The change of control was gazetted on 1 March 1917. The national pleasure resort&#x27;s development into &quot;an important regional tourist destination was greatly assisted by the discovery in 1969 in Victoria Cave of the largest known Australian Pleistocene vertebrate fossil cave deposit&quot;.

===Conservation Park===
On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the &quot; Naracoorte Caves Conservation Park&quot; upon the proclamation of the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; which repealed the former act along with other statutes concerned with conservation. In 1982, the conservation park was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

===World heritage listing===
On 17 December 1994, part of the conservation park, being an area of was &quot;inscribed on the World Heritage List&quot; along with the Riversleigh fossil site in Queensland as the Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh/Naracoorte).

===National Park===
On 18 January 2001, the Naracoorte Caves Conservation Park was abolished and the land that it occupied was reconstituted as a national park because it was considered to be &quot;of national significance by reason of the natural features of the land&quot; and was assigned the name, Naracoorte Caves National Park.

===National heritage listing===
On 21 May 2007 The Australian Fossil Mammal Sites was one of 15 World Heritage places to be added to the Australian National Heritage List.

===State heritage listing===
On 17 May 2017, the extent of the national park was listed as a state heritage place on the South Australian Heritage Register with the name of the &quot;Naracoorte Caves Complex&quot;.

==Visitor attraction==

The park is a visitor destination in itself, with a camping ground and caravan park, dormitory accommodation for groups, picnic grounds and a licensed cafe. The range of visitor activities is extensive. Show cave tours are guided by professional interpreters through highly decorated caves with some tours visiting amazing fossil deposits. Modern technology has been utilised to show visitors the normally inaccessible interior of Bat Cave, where thousands of southern bent-wing bats breed each year. Other opportunities include adventure caving, a selection of specialty tours and special events. The Wonambi Fossil Centre, the park&#x27;s visitor centre, features displays of fossils and bones found in the caves and dioramas of extinct animals.

==Structure==
The limestone of the area was formed from coral and marine creatures 200 million years ago and again 20 million years ago when the land was below sea level. Ground water since then has dissolved and eroded some of the limestone, creating the caves. The caves, such as the Victoria Fossil Cave and Blanche Cave, are often not far below ground, and holes open up creating traps for the unwary. This is the source of the remarkable collection of fossils. Mammals and other land creatures have fallen into open caves and been unable to escape. The fossil record has been preserved in strata formed from eroded topsoil washed and blown in. In some places, the fossil-bearing silt is up to 20 metres thick. Some of these areas are being preserved for future research when better methods of dating and reconstructing fossil records may have been found. These fossil traps are especially significant for tracing Australian megafauna.

The latest research pushes back the date of the caves&#x27; formation to at least 1.34 million years ago.

<doc id="101786" wikidata="Q1140071" url="?curid=101786" title="Onkaparinga River National Park">
<text>Onkaparinga River National Park is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located about south of Adelaide city centre. It extends over the floodplain of the Onkaparinga River east of Main South Road.

==History==
Most of the land now dedicated to the national park was purchased in the period 1973 to 1977 by a former SA government agency, the State Planning Authority. The purpose of the land acquisition which included land along the full length of Onkaparinga River was threefold. Firstly, it was ‘to provide open space for recreational purposes’, secondly, ‘to preserve the natural character of the landscape, including the native flora and fauna’ and thirdly, ‘to function as a buffer between areas of urban and rural land.’ In 1982, the majority of the land was transferred to the then Department for Environment and Heritage which established the Onkaparinga River Recreation Park in 1985. In 1993, all of the land east of Main South Road (known as the gorge section’) was removed from the recreation park and constituted as the Onkaparinga River National Park. For managerial and administrative purposes, the recreation park and the national park are known collectively as the ‘Onkaparinga River Reserve’.

==Prior use of land==
The lower reaches of the Onkaparinga River were inhabited by the Kaurna Aboriginal people, and the name of the river is taken from the Kaurna name meaning chief. European settlement and farming in the district began about 1840 leading to the rapid displacement of the Aboriginal inhabitants. Kaurna people still have strong ties to the area through cultural practices and religious beliefs. The town of Noarlunga (renamed Old Noarlunga) was the service centre with farm produce being transported down river to Port Noarlunga.

==Flora and fauna==

The vegetation of the park has been greatly perturbed by human activity, but remnant patches remain. The most intact area is the Hardy&#x27;s Scrub section of the reserve. 160 years of livestock grazing, timber harvesting and cropping has cleared most of the reserve of native understorey species and in many areas invasive grasses are the main vegetation type. Remnant eucalypts are the most noticeable native species in the reserve. &quot;Eucalyptus microcarpa&quot; (grey box), &quot;Eucalyptus fasciculosa&quot; (pink gum), &quot;Eucalyptus porosa&quot; (mallee box), &quot;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&quot; (red gum), and &quot;Eucalyptus leucoxylon&quot; (blue gum) all occur in the reserve. The European olive (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;) is a noxious weed in South Australia and has invaded the park, although generally individuals are not as large as in older parks in the Mount Lofty Ranges like Belair National Park but will continue to be a problem unless managed. Over the last twenty years accessible areas of the gorge have been revegetated by contractors working for National Parks SA. The oldest area of revegetation in the park was conducted with tubestock, predominantly of eucalypts. Recent efforts have focused on the direct seeding method where seed of native species is ploughed into a scraped trench. Insect activity includes butterflies (Lepidoptera) and dragonflies (Anisoptera). Kangaroos are common among the open hillsides with abundant grasses.

==Trails==

===Hardys Scrub Hike===

2 hr loop, loop (Gate 11).

This patch of native vegetation is a very important conservation area, despite a history of timber cutting, quarrying and grazing.

===Nature Hike===
2 hr loop, loop (Gate 6).

The Nature Hike includes good views of the gorge, while trails provide an opportunity to view many species of
birds and the occasional lizard.

===Echidna Hike===

2.5 hr loop, loop (Gate 7).

The Echidna Trail winds its way amongst some of the best remnant vegetation and visits six heritage sites, including huts and houses built in the 1880s. The dominant overstorey species is peppermint box, with river red gum in the gullies and pink gum on the higher slopes. Other plant species include sheoak, golden wattle, a small stand of native pine and various herbaceous ground covers. Twenty-seven native orchid species have been recorded in the area.

===Sundews Ridge Hike===
2 hr loop, loop (Gate 6).

A relatively short hike to view the rocky outcrops and
meandering Onkaparinga River from the Sundews Lookout.

===Gorge Track===
4 hr return, return (Gate 18).

This hard trail takes you to gorge vantage points
before descending steeply to the river.

===Sundews River Hike===

4 hr loop, loop (Gate 6).

This rocky trail descends steeply from the Sundews Lookout to the bottom of the gorge, and then follows the river downstream for a short distance before returning up the steep slopes of the gorge to the ridge and then the car park.

===Rock climbing===
Climbing is permitted on the designated cliff area near Gate 10. Specific skills and equipment are required. Climbers are required to contact the Belair District Office first.

<text>Witjira National Park is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia about north of the state capital of Adelaide.

==History==
The national park was proclaimed on 21 November 1985 to &quot;protect Australia’s largest array of artesian springs: the nationally significant Dalhousie Mound Springs complex&quot;. In 2007, it became the first protected area in South Australia to have formal joint management arrangements between its traditional owners and the Government of South Australia.

The extent of land occupied by the national park was gazetted as a locality in April 2013 under the name &quot;Witjira&quot;.

On 26 November 2021, the government changed the conditions of the park, to forever exclude mining in the Dalhousie Springs National Heritage Area.

==Description==
As of 2018, it covered an area of .

The national park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area. It was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate during or after 1998.

The historic Dalhousie Homestead Ruins, from the former Dalhousie Station, lie within the national park and are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

<doc id="101789" wikidata="Q1535874" url="?curid=101789" title="John Otway">
<text>John Otway (born 2 October 1952) is an English singer-songwriter who has built a cult audience through extensive touring.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Otway was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. From the age of nine all he ever wanted to be was a pop star.

===1970s and 1980s===
Although his first single, &quot;Gypsy&quot;/&quot;Misty Mountain&quot; was released in 1972, Otway gained wider recognition riding the wave of punk rock and his unique performance on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. His sixth single, the half-spoken love song &quot;Really Free&quot; reached number 27 in the UK singles chart in 1977. It would be his greatest success for some time. The song earned him a five-album deal with Polydor Records, who viewed him as a punk rather than merely an eccentric. His first album, recorded with Wild Willy Barrett, was produced by Pete Townshend but sold only fitfully. The follow-up singles fared no better despite some imaginative promotion, which included an offer for Otway to come to a buyer&#x27;s house and perform the 1979 single, &quot;Frightened and Scared&quot;, if their copy was one of only three copies from which the vocal had been omitted. Otway&#x27;s and Barrett&#x27;s only other UK chart success came in July 1980 with &quot;DK 50/80&quot;, a modest No. 45 hit.
When Otway turned solo, his audience remained loyal despite poor record sales. In the mid-1980s, he often appeared on Vivian and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall&#x27;s showboat, the Old Profanity Showboat, in Bristol&#x27;s Floating Harbour. He also appeared as the musical guest in the final episode of the British sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;.

===1990s and 2000s===
His 1990 autobiography, &quot;Cor Baby, That&#x27;s Really Me&quot; (subtitled &quot;Rock and Roll&#x27;s Greatest Failure&quot;) was a study in self-deprecation, and his touring continued to sustain him. In the 1990s, he toured as &quot;Headbutts and Halibuts&quot;, with Attila the Stockbroker with whom he wrote a surreal rock opera called &quot;Cheryl&quot;. In 1992 Otway appeared at GuilFest. In 1993 he was able to draw 2,500 fans to a gig in London and, in 1998, 4,000 celebrated his birthday with him at the Royal Albert Hall, coinciding with the release of &quot;Premature Adulation&quot;, his first album of new material for over ten years.

By then, Otway had realised he could use his fanbase, who were in on the joke, to engage in minor publicity stunts. A grassroots campaign saw his &quot;Beware of the Flowers Cause I&#x27;m Sure They&#x27;re Going to Get You Yeah&quot; voted the seventh greatest lyric of all time in a BBC poll. In 2002, when asked what he wanted for his 50th birthday, he requested &quot;a second hit&quot;. A concerted drive, including a poll (scrutinised by the Electoral Reform Society) to select the track, saw &quot;Bunsen Burner&quot; – with music sampled from the Trammps song &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; and lyrics devised to help his daughter with her chemistry homework – reach number nine in the UK singles chart on 6 October, and earned Otway an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, BBC Television&#x27;s flagship popular music programme. To encourage fans to buy more than one copy each of the single, he released three different versions. The flip-side of &quot;Bunsen Burner – The Hit Mix&quot; was a cover of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; recorded at Abbey Road Studios and featuring 900 of his fans on backing vocals, each of whom was credited by name on the single&#x27;s sleeve. Thanks to this second hit he has now been able to release his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. Commenting on the fact that the title of this album is now in the plural, Otway said that he was very proud of it, having &quot;finally got it (the &#x27;s&#x27;) on the right side of &quot;Hit&quot;&quot;.

Buoyed by the success of the hit campaign, Otway planned an ambitious world tour in October 2006. He proposed hiring his own jet to take his band, and 300 of his fans, to some of the most prestigious venues in the world, including Carnegie Hall and Sydney Opera House. Despite over 150 fans signing up, the tour was cancelled as the costs of the plane spiralled.

===2010s and 2020s===
Otway is still touring in various formats. In 2009, he was re-united with Wild Willy Barrett for a UK tour, the duo now perform together regularly and even recorded a new album in 2011 called &quot;40-Odd Years of Otway and Barrett&quot; consisting of re-workings of old songs and a new, previously unrecorded song &quot;The Snowflake Effect&quot;. Otway also tours as a solo act, as a duo with Richard Holgarth and often with his Big Band which includes Murray Torkildsen (guitar and stylophone), Seymour Fluids (bass), Adam Batterbee (drums) and guest keyboard player Barry Upton.

In October 2012, to celebrate his 60th birthday, Otway booked the Odeon Leicester Square to show the documentary of his life. Titled &quot;Rock and Roll&#x27;s Greatest Failure: Otway the Movie&quot;, the screening saw cinematic history made with the final scenes of the movie being filmed from the red carpet on the morning of the film. The film was funded by fans becoming producers who, as with the Hit campaign, were all individually credited in the movie credits. Following the success of the producers&#x27; premiere, 2013 saw Otway take the completed movie to the Cannes Film Festival. Ever resourceful and still with an eye for a publicity stunt, Otway and 100 of his fans (who donned Otway masks and dressed up in Otway&#x27;s traditional black jeans and white shirt) travelled down the Promenade de la Croisette to the red carpet. The film also had its theatrical release at Glastonbury Festival in June 2013, before going on a national cinema tour in the summer.

He delivers occasional (humorous) lectures on the theme, &quot;Making Success Out of Failure&quot;, and the sequel to his autobiography, &quot;I Did It Otway&quot; (subtitled &quot;Rock and Roll&#x27;s Greatest Failure&quot;) was published in May 2010. The book was designed by John Haxby who has also designed Otway&#x27;s album sleeves over the past 15 years.

At Christmas 2014, Otway attempted to crack the Christmas market with the EP &quot;A John Otway Christma5&quot;, the lead track &quot;OK Father Christmas&quot; basing a new lyric on top of the earlier single &quot;DK 50/80&quot;.

During 2016, Otway set up an online Kickstarter campaign for &#x27;A New Album of Otway Songs&#x27;. The campaign was successful, raising £38,916 from a total of 838 individual backers. The resulting album and DVD, &quot;Montserrat&quot;, was recorded at Olveston House, Montserrat, in September 2016 and released in March 2017, to those who had supported the Kickstarter campaign, followed by general release on 1 May 2017.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Otway started a series of Facebook live concerts on 28 March 2020. These receive around 10 thousand views per stream. He performed nine such between March and May 2020.

On 2 April 2022, Otway played his 5,000th career gig, which, as a milestone event, was held at the O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. This featured performances of many of his popular songs from his career, with a first set played with long time musical partner Wild Willy Barrett and a second set with the Otway Big Band.

In September 2022, Otway received a Honorary PhD in Music presented by Oxford Brookes University.

<doc id="101791" wikidata="Q7323265" url="?curid=101791" title="Rich Garcés">
<text>Richard Alan Garcés Mendoza, Jr. [gar-CESS] (born May 18, 1971) is a former right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. Nicknamed &quot;El Guapo&quot; (&quot;The handsome one&quot;), he played with the Minnesota Twins (1990, 1993), Chicago Cubs (1995), Florida Marlins (1995) and Boston Red Sox (1996–2002). More recently, he&#x27;s spent time coaching at various programs in the Connecticut area.

==Career==
Garcés was signed by Minnesota as an amateur free agent in 1987. After stints with the Twins, Cubs and Marlins, he pitched for the Red Sox, turning into one of the American League&#x27;s premier setup men. He quickly became a favorite among Red Sox fans, as much for his large size as his performance. His weight was listed at 215 lbs, although it is widely believed to have been significantly higher. The Red Sox asked Garcés to lose weight over an off-season, which he did. His numbers were never the same after that, however, leading many to believe the drastic weight loss negatively affected his mechanics.

In 1999, Garcés posted a 5–1 record with 33 strikeouts, a 1.55 earned run average, and two saves. This was followed with a mark of 8–1, 69 SO, 3.25 ERA, and one save in 2000.

Although only 31 years old in 2002, Garcés&#x27; performance displayed a much-weakened arm strength. After his disappointing ERA of 7.59 in 21 innings, he was released by Boston. On January 22, 2003, he signed with the Colorado Rockies as a free agent, but he was released in March 2003 before the regular season started.

In a ten-year career, Garcés compiled a 23–10 record with a 3.74 ERA, seven saves, 53 holds, 296 strikeouts, 164 walks, and innings pitched in 287 games, holding opponents to a .227 batting average.

In June 2005, Garcés signed a minor league contract with the Red Sox, pitched in the Gulf Coast League for the Gulf Coast Red Sox. He was released in October 2005.

Garcés played for the Venezuelan Professional Winter League in 2006, finishing 3–1 with 11 saves and a 2.31 ERA in 24 appearances for the Aguilas del Zulia. Based on this performance, Garcés signed a contract in February 2007 to pitch for the Nashua Pride (of the independent Can-Am League) with the hope of working his way back to the major leagues. He served as a relief pitcher for the Pride in 2007 and 2008.

On November 1, 2024, Garcés was elected to the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 78% of the votes from the Contemporary Committee.

==Coaching==
In recent years, Garcés has spent time coaching in various baseball programs around the Connecticut area. In 2017 he was the pitching coach for the Bridgeport Bluefish. In November 2020 he joined the staff of the CT Edge Baseball Academy. In 2022 he worked as the Pitching Coordinator for the CT Mets, and also worked with Gap2Gap Baseball.

<doc id="101792" wikidata="Q1138453" url="?curid=101792" title="Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park">
<text>Cradle Mountain–Lake St Clair National Park is located in the Central Highlands area of Tasmania (Australia), northwest of Hobart. The park contains many walking trails, and is where hikes along the well-known Overland Track usually begin. Major features are Cradle Mountain and Barn Bluff in the northern end, Mount Pelion East, Mount Pelion West, Mount Oakleigh and Mount Ossa in the middle and Lake St Clair in the southern end of the park. The park is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.

== History ==

=== Use by Aboriginal Nations ===
Cradle Mountain–Lake St Clair National Park lies on the boundary between the Big River and Northern Tasmanian Aboriginal nations. Aboriginal use of the Cradle Mountain dates back to the last ice age (10,000 years ago) and is believed to have been non-permanent, consisting mostly of seasonal hunting excursions during the summer months. Several artifacts and campsites containing various stone types and tools have been discovered at Pelion Plains and Lake St Clair, and early surveyors reported huts in the area. Aboriginal Tasmanians were persecuted by the European settlers upon their arrival, and the last free Aboriginals in the area were seen between Barn Bluff and Lake Windemere in 1836.

=== Early European Development ===
Europeans first explored Cradle Mountain in 1827 and 1828 with Joseph Fossey and Henry Hellyer surveying for the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company. Lake St Clair was sighted by surveyor William Sharland in 1832, with George Frankland leading an expedition to it three years later.

During the late 19th century there was an effort to build a railway to the west coast of Tasmania, which at the time was only accessible by boat. Railway engineer Allan Stewart began surveying a route which led up the Mersey Valley, but ran out of money before it could be completed. Parts of his trail were used by the Innes track (est. 1897), which led to the mining town of Rosebery.

These tracks encouraged prospecting, and several mines were set up including coal near Barn Bluff, copper in Pelion Plains, Lake Windemere and Commonwealth Creek, tin in Mount Inglis, and tungsten in the Forth Valley. Lake Windemere and Old Pelion huts were established during this mining effort.

Trappers worked in the area from the 1860s until the collapse of the fur trade in the 1950s, although hunting in the park was declared illegal after 1927. They established huts, including Du Cane and Pine Valley, and burned the land to encourage fresh growth and game.

During the same timeframe Pelion Plains was used by sheep and cattle for grazing in the summer, and wild cattle lived in the area until 1948. The cattle were reportedly quite aggressive, and known to attack early bushwalkers.

=== Environmental Protection and Tourism ===
Both Lake St Clair and Cradle Mountain were regarded by European settlers as attractive destinations, with tourist lodges at each location.

In the 1910s Gustav and Kate Cowle began campaigning for the area from Cradle Mountain to Lake St Clair to be a national park. It was declared a scenic reserve in 1922, a wildlife reserve in 1927 and its current designation of national park from 1947. During this transition, former trappers began building huts and guiding bushwalkers, including Paddy Hartnett, Weindorfer and Bob Quaile.

In the 1970s management of the park passed to the newly formed Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service after the controversial flooding of Lake Pedder.

== Access ==
Access from the south (Lake St. Clair) is usually from Derwent Bridge on the Lyell Highway. Northern access (Cradle Valley) is usually via Sheffield, Wilmot or Mole Creek. A less frequently used entrance is via the Arm River Track, from the east.

=== Usage fee ===
In 2005, the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service introduced a booking system and fee for use of the Overland Track over peak periods. Initially the fee was $100, but this was raised to $150 in 2007, and as at May 2023 is $200. The money that is collected is used to finance the park ranger organisation, track maintenance, building of new facilities and rental of helicopter transport to remove waste from the toilets at the huts in the park.

=== Development ===
The Tasmanian Government has moved to allow development in national parks and conservations areas. An &#x27;In principle&#x27; permit has been granted for the establishment of an &#x27;eco-friendly&#x27; resort at Pumphouse Point at Lake St Clair.

== Climate ==


== Biodiversity ==
The Cradle Mountain–Lake St Clair National Park is a significant location of Tasmania&#x27;s endemic species – 40–55% of the park&#x27;s documented alpine flora is endemic. Furthermore, 68% of the higher rainforest species recorded in alpine areas in Tasmania are present in the Cradle Mountain–Lake St Clair National Park. The park&#x27;s alpine vegetation is very diverse and has largely escaped forest fires that have caused neighbouring regions to suffer.

Animals present in the park include: Tasmanian pademelons, Bennett&#x27;s wallabies, quolls, Tasmanian devils, short-beaked echidnas, platypuses, common wombats, possums, forest ravens and currawongs.

=== Birds ===
The park has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it provides habitat for 11 of Tasmania&#x27;s endemic bird species, as well as for the flame and pink robins and the striated fieldwren. The IBA is important as a representative protected area in north-central Tasmania for those species.

=== Fungi ===

Fungi are also a part of the Park&#x27;s biodiversity. While the Management Plan for Cradle Mountain–Lake St Clair National Park only mentions fungi in the context of their destructive effects (&quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; and &quot;Chalara australis&quot;), the Park has a great variety of fungi that perform beneficial ecological roles. In fact, most fungi perform positive rather than negative roles. Even parasitic fungi – often regarded only negatively – are a vital part of healthy ecosystems, regulating ecosystem functions.

As primary recyclers of organic matter, saprobic fungi break down fallen branches and leaf litter, making vital nutrients available to other organisms. Other fungi form symbiotic relationships with other organisms. Although rarely acknowledged, the great majority of plants in Cradle Mountain–Lake St Clair National Park (indeed in the world) form mutually beneficial mycorrhizal relationships with fungi.

Given the great diversity of plants, specialist habitats and micro-climates in the park, a great diversity of fungi, including lichens, is also expected to occur there. Several hundred species have already been recorded by field naturalists and interested individuals and can be found in the Atlas of Living Australia.

Despite their essential roles in underpinning terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are barely recognised as a vital part of Australia&#x27;s biodiversity. Although Australia has national and state level biodiversity conservation strategies and has ratified international conventions, most overlook fungi, including Tasmania&#x27;s Natural Heritage Strategy, which only makes one generic reference to fungi.

One of the more a conspicuous species found in the wetter parts of the park is the strawberry bracket fungus (&quot;Tyromyces pulcherrimus&quot;). It grows on myrtle beech (&quot;Nothofagus cunninghammii&quot;) and snow gums. The Australian citizen-science organisation, Fungimap is documenting and mapping the distribution of fungi including those that occur in National Parks. &quot;Cortinarius metallicus&quot; is a mycorrhizal species also found in the park.

<text>Douglas-Apsley is a national park and a locality on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, 149 km northeast of Hobart, and a few kilometres north of Bicheno. It is one of Tasmania&#x27;s newer National Parks, having been declared on 27 December 1989.

==Description==
The park preserves remnant east coast dry forested catchment of three main streams, Apsley River, Denison Rivulet and Douglas River. Highlights include deep gorges, wildflower displays and mild inland climate. Visitors can undertake short walks or do a three-day trek.

==Birds==
The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports 11 of Tasmania&#x27;s endemic bird species as well as flame and pink robins and, probably, swift parrots.

<text>Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers is a national park in Tasmania, 117 km west of Hobart. It is named after the two main river systems lying within the bounds of the park - the Franklin River and the Gordon River.

== Location ==
The Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park lies between the Central Highlands and West Coast Range of Tasmania in the heart of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.

It is bisected by the only road to pass through this area - the Lyell Highway.

== History ==
The genesis of the Wild Rivers National Park was in the earlier Frenchmans Cap National Park which had the Franklin River as its boundary on the northern and western borders. Frenchmans Cap is a dominant feature in the region, and can be seen on the skyline from the west and north of the park.

The Gordon and Franklin Rivers were the subject of one of Australia&#x27;s largest conservation efforts. The Franklin Dam was part of a proposed hydro-electric power scheme that had been in the plans of The Hydro for some time. The enthusiastic endorsement by Robin Gray&#x27;s Liberal Government would have seen the river flooded. It became a national issue for the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, led by its director at the time, Bob Brown.

Despite being given heritage status, the catchments and rivers remain at risk.

==Access points==
The Lyell Highway winds for 56 kilometres through the heart of the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park.

<doc id="101795" wikidata="Q930677" url="?curid=101795" title="Freycinet National Park">
<text>Freycinet National Park is a national park on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, northeast of Hobart. It occupies a large part of the Freycinet Peninsula, named after French navigator Louis de Freycinet, and Schouten Island. Founded in 1916, it is Tasmania&#x27;s oldest park, along with Mount Field National Park. Bordering the national park is the small settlement of Coles Bay, and the largest nearby town is Swansea. Freycinet contains part of the rugged Tasmanian coastline and includes the secluded Wineglass Bay. Features of the park include its red and pink granite formations and a series of jagged granite peaks in a line, called &quot;The Hazards&quot;.

Because of the range of rare and endemic flora and fauna species present, as well as the diversity of landscapes and communities at Freycinet National Park, its role in conservation is particularly significant. The area within the park is also of cultural importance, with many Aboriginal and European sites protected, though deeper investigation into human history within the park still needs to be undertaken. Large sections of the park remain undisturbed by humans, including parts of the catchment and the landscape.

Tourism at Freycinet forms a significant component of the economy for the eastern part of Tasmania, with visitors drawn to the region by the natural environment, weather and recreational activities available in the area. Every year thousands of people are attracted to the coastal environments and the area&#x27;s rural and isolated setting.

== Geology ==
Devonian granite is the dominant rock type at Freycinet. Orthoclase, a pink feldspar, gives the mountains and coastline their characteristic pink tint. Black micas and white quartz are also found. The western side of Schouten Island is composed of Jurassic dolerite.

== Ecology ==

Forty-nine species endemic to Tasmania are found at Freycinet. Mammals found include the brushtail possum, ringtail possum, sugar glider, eastern pygmy possum, little pygmy possum, echidna, wombats, New Holland mouse, swamp rat, water rat, Tasmanian bettong and the long-nosed potoroo.

The Tasmanian devil was once common at the park, but has seen a significant drop in density due to the devil facial tumour disease. Cetaceans such as southern right whale, humpback whale, and bottlenose dolphins are known to use the bay to feed, calve or to take rests.

=== Flora ===

The vegetation in Freycinet National Park is indicative of temperature ranges and precipitation, just as it is through the rest of Tasmania. In this part of the state it is dominated by dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands, with black peppermint (&quot;Eucalyptus amygdalina&quot;) growing over an understorey of varying heaths such as &quot;Banksia&quot; spp., &quot;Leptospermum&quot; spp., &quot;Thryptomene&quot; spp., &quot;Melaleuca&quot; spp. and &quot;Calytrix&quot; spp. in the area of Hazards Lagoon. West of the lagoon the coastal scrub consists of &quot;Acacia longifolia&quot; with a thick forest of &quot;Allocasuarina verticillata&quot;, and to the east &quot;Eucalyptus ovata&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot; dominate the dry woodlands.

More than 500 plants have been recorded within the park, with over 80 species of orchids being sighted. Several species have a restricted distribution and numerous species, such as &quot;Melaleuca pustulata&quot;, &quot;Cyphanthera tasmanica&quot;, &quot;Epacris barbata&quot; and &quot;Westringia brevifolia&quot; var. &quot;raleighi&quot; are listed under the Tasmanian &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot; (&quot;TSP Act&quot;).

=== Fauna ===
==== Mammals ====
The red-necked wallaby, also called Bennett&#x27;s wallaby (&quot;Macropus rufogriseus&quot;), is one of the most commonly seen animals within the park and can be spotted grazing on low lying vegetation such as grass, they are also known to gather around people. Another common species seen is the eastern quoll (&quot;Dasyurus viverrinus&quot;), a marsupial carnivore which was previously sighted on the mainland of Australia but is now only found in Tasmania. Also extinct on the mainland, the Tasmanian pademelon (&quot;Thylogale billardierii&quot;) is still common in Freycinet National Park but they are rarely seen during the day, coming out at night to feed.

Echidnas (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;) can be seen during the day foraging through litter on forest floors, or among coastal vegetation, searching for ants or other food sources. The eastern pygmy possum (&quot;Cercartetus nanus&quot;) and the little pygmy possum (&quot;Cercartetus lepidus&quot;) are listed as vulnerable in several mainland Australian states but are not listed in Tasmania, and although they can be found at Freycinet, sightings of them are uncommon. The New Holland mouse (&quot;Pseudomys novaehollandiae&quot;) is listed as endangered under the Tasmanian &quot;TSP Act&quot; and sightings are rare, but it is known to be present within Freycinet National Park.

==== Reptiles and amphibians ====

There are numerous reptiles that are found at Freycinet including lizards, skinks and snakes. The ocellated skink (&quot;Niveoscincus ocellatus&quot;), Tasmanian tree skink (&quot;Niveoscincus pretiosus&quot;) and she-oak skink (&quot;Cyclodomorphus casuarinae&quot;) are all endemic to Tasmania and found in the park. Other species found include the blotched blue-tongued lizard (&quot;Tiliqua nigrolutea&quot;), mountain dragon (&quot;Rankinia diemensis&quot;) and lowland copperhead snake (&quot;Austrelaps superbus&quot;). The Tasmanian froglet (&quot;Ranidella tasmaniensis&quot;) is also endemic to Tasmania and can be seen in several creeks in Freycinet, along with the frequently spotted common eastern froglet (&quot;Crinia signifera&quot;) found in low-lying water bodies such as swamps. Other amphibians found include the southern toadlet (&quot;Pseudophryne semimarmorata&quot;), spotted grass frog (&quot;Limnodynastes tasmaniensis&quot;), southern brown tree frog (&quot;Litoria ewingii&quot;) and growling grass frog (&quot;Litoria raniformis&quot;).

==== Birds ====
Owing to the varying ecosystems in Freycinet there are many species of birds that either inhabit or fly through the park. They range from large predator species such as the brown falcon (&quot;Falco berigora&quot;) and white-bellied sea eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucogaster&quot;) to smaller species including the superb fairy-wren (&quot;Malurus cyaneus&quot;) and flame robin (&quot;Petroica phoenicea&quot;). There are also several species which are listed on the &quot;TSP Act&quot;, such as the black-browed albatross (&quot;Thalassarche melanophris&quot;), shy albatross (&quot;Thalassarche cauta&quot;), Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax fleayi&quot;), white-fronted tern (&quot;Sterna striata&quot;), Australian fairy tern (&quot;Sternula nereis nereis&quot;) and the swift parrot (&quot;Lathamus discolor&quot;). The endangered swift parrot breeds on the east coast of Tasmania from September through to January, their movements corresponding to the flowering of several &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; spp. before they migrate to the mainland over winter.

== Climate ==
The park receives on average 600 mm (23.6 in.) of rain per year. It has a climate similar to that of Southern France with on average more than 300 days of sunshine.
== Environmental threats ==

There are numerous threats to species within Freycinet National Park, and with recreation and tourism in natural areas becoming increasingly popular further stresses can be placed on flora and fauna already struggling to survive. There can be many impacts caused by the building and maintenance of roads, tracks, lookouts and various types of accommodation. A study conducted by Jones observed that species such as the Tasmanian devil and eastern quoll are more susceptible to being killed by cars after road upgrades to increase the volume of tourist traffic.

There can also be direct and indirect damage to vegetation and habitats from activities such as bushwalking and horse riding, as well as an increased risk of alterations to soil characteristics and the transmission of disease. An example of this is the fungus &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, which numerous plant families in Freycinet National Park are susceptible to, and which also places rare and endangered species at greater risk of extinction. Visitors to the park may also inadvertently bring in seeds of weeds on clothing or equipment.

One of the most serious threats faced by any species within Freycinet is the devil facial tumour which has seen the Tasmanian devil&#x27;s (&quot;Sarcophilus harrisii&quot;) conservation status upgraded in 2008 to endangered under the &quot;TSP Act&quot;. Studies have shown there has been a decline in the population of the Tasmanian devil in the area, with this decrease in numbers being associated with the devil facial tumour. This infectious disease, caused by a transmissible cancer has become a serious threat to populations of devils throughout Tasmania and has seen a change to the age structure within the population at Freycinet National Park. A decrease in breeding age adults has placed pressure on the persistence of the species with most females now only having the opportunity to breed once rather than typically producing offspring annually for 3 years after the age of two.

The loss of Tasmanian devils also places other species within Freycinet National Park at risk, as the decline of such a predator could alter interactions between other species. For instance, research has shown that the eastern quoll is in decline at Freycinet as well as other parts of the state. It is possible the changes occurring due to the decline of the Tasmanian devil are affecting the behaviour of other predators and species.

Threats that are faced by the endangered eastern quoll, which are common to many species, and include introduced species, increasing dry conditions and modifications to habitats are also faced by the Tasmanian bettong (&quot;Bettongia gaimardi&quot;). A recent study showed a decline in observations of the Tasmanian bettong with the occurrence of feral cats, though further research is still required to determine if this introduced species is a predator of &quot;B. gaimardi&quot; and if the Tasmanian bettong is susceptible like some Australian mammals to the disease toxoplasmosis carried by cats.

== Management ==
=== Management plans ===
As directed under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1970&quot;, the Freycinet National Park, Wye State Reserve Management Plan was developed in 2000. This plan outlines the objectives and visions for the park, with a focus on conservation and protection of species and ecosystems. The plan has since been altered in 2004 in response to changing circumstances, and was again updated in 2015.

=== Public awareness ===
The use of public programs and signs in national parks to make people aware of the dangers of feeding wildlife has been shown to be of benefit in Freycinet National Park. Signs were constructed in an attempt to make people aware that feeding native species could not only make animals more susceptible to predators, but also cause diseases, including bone deformities, and social disturbances. A study conducted by Mallick and Driessen showed that there has been an increase in awareness to not feed wildlife and the majority of people had seen information related to the &#x27;keep wildlife wild&#x27; program.

== Preservation ==
Throughout the 1900s there was a significant loss of over 60% of core wilderness in Tasmania, however during this time there was also a huge increase in the amount of wilderness area which became protected in the reserve system. Locations on the Freycinet Peninsula, along with Mount William and Maria Island were the only areas on the east coast which had not vanished. It has been suggested locations in the reserve system included minimal variation in community types and land which had been deemed of little economic importance, and it wasn&#x27;t until the 1970s and onwards when management for conservation became more of a priority. It has perhaps proven beneficial in terms of biodiversity that areas within Freycinet National Park were unsuitable for practices such as farming or other economic gain.

The bioregion and catchment which Freycinet National Park is a part of are seen as having a low variegated landscape, with 80-90% of native vegetation still intact. Delegation of this area as a national park has allowed numerous species to be protected, including some which are vulnerable or endangered, with the primary objective being to protect the habitats of native flora and fauna. Making Freycinet a protected area has not only allowed for relevant management actions to be carried out, but it also means the prohibition of land clearing and the grazing of stock within the park. Although flora and fauna still face risks to their survival, having the benefits of legislation and funding that is provided by having habitats within the park aids in raising not only the chances of survival but awareness of these species. Government agencies are also able to conduct monitoring of species responses to any threats on a regular basis.

An example of such species is the sand grass tree (&quot;Xanthorrhoea arenaria&quot;), which is endemic to Tasmania and can only be found at a few locations in the state. It is also listed as vulnerable at both a national and state level by the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (&quot;EPBC Act&quot;) and the &quot;TSP Act&quot;. As Freycinet National Park is managed for conservation, strategies have been implemented which aim to prevent the spread of the disease &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; throughout the populations of this species and threaten the number of individuals surviving in the park. Due to the confusion in separating this species from &quot;Xanthorrhoea bracteata&quot; exact population estimates are difficult to achieve, but as they are known to occur at locations within Freycinet National Park this assists in their conservation with regards to some threatening processes including land clearing for development.

Similarly, &quot;Philotheca freyciana&quot;, or the Freycinet Waxflower, is listed by the Commonwealth &quot;EPBC Act&quot; and the Tasmanian &quot;TSP Act&quot; as endangered. This species only occurs on the Freycinet Peninsula and can mostly be found dispersed among granite rocks of the Hazards within Freycinet National Park, where approximately 100 individuals have been recorded. Initially only 3 plants were recorded to exist, but after surveys were conducted by staff from numerous government agencies throughout the Freycinet Peninsula over 100 individuals were found in areas around The Hazards, but none elsewhere, highlighting the importance of their conservation within the national park. Due to its occurrence within the park &quot;P. freyciana&quot; is able to be monitored and threats to its survival can be identified until further surveys and studies can be done on the species to gain a greater understanding of it. Given the very specific requirements for the growth of &quot;P. freyciana&quot; it is believed the chances of any further populations growing outside their occurrence in Freycinet National Park is small.

Known to occur with &quot;P. freyciana&quot; is &quot;Epacris barbata&quot; which is also listed as endangered under the &quot;EPBC Act&quot; and the &quot;TSP Act&quot;. This species is endemic to Tasmania and occurs mostly within Freycinet National Park, with only one population found outside the park. &quot;E. barbata&quot; is susceptible to &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, and not only do sites undergo regular monitoring for infestation by the pathogen but wash stations have also been installed in an attempt to reduce transmission from bushwalkers. Such measures can be implemented by government agencies who have the knowledge and equipment required to assist in protection within a national park, while the necessary level of protection for a species may be unavailable for those that fall outside such protected areas.

These species are also known to have varying requirements with regards to fire and the intensity and frequency for which they can regenerate. Any planned burns within the park, that form part of management plans, can take these species into consideration to protect them.

Previously believed to be extinct, the New Holland mouse was discovered in Tasmania in 1970s. Owing to its restricted habitat in the state it is considered rare, but there are several key population sites within Freycinet, including Friendly Beaches. These protected locations provide the species with preferred environmental conditions, such as a sandy substrate for burrows, combined with a mixed understorey of flora as a food source.

The conservation of Freycinet also provides protection of habitats important for the swift parrot. The species is known to move along the east coast of Tasmania with &quot;Eucalyptus ovata&quot; being one of its main food sources. Swift parrots are found breeding up to 10 km from the coastline on ridges and slopes of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; woodlands and forests, such as those of Freycinet. The protection of the vegetation within Freycinet National Park is a vital component in the survival of the endangered species, providing breeding sites, food resources and assisting in the movement of the species during migration.

Similarly, Freycinet and its surrounds are of significance to the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle and white-bellied sea eagle, with there being an overlap in management and habitat requirements of the swift parrot. Both eagle species have specific requirements for nesting which notably includes the absence of disturbance and presence of water nearby. The protection provided by Freycinet National Park assists in providing suitable habitat for both species by denying the development of plantations and urbanisation of the environment.

<doc id="101796" wikidata="Q827519" url="?curid=101796" title="Hartz Mountains National Park">
<text>Hartz Mountains National Park is located in the south of Tasmania, Australia. It is one of 19 Tasmanian National Parks, and in 1989 it was included in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, in recognition of its natural and cultural values. The Hartz Mountains were named after the Harz mountain range in Germany.

==Geography and geology==
Most of the park is over 600 metres above sea level, with altitudes ranging from 160 m at the Picton River to 1,255 m at Hartz Peak. The backbone of rock in the park is dolerite, while the southern areas at lower altitudes are constituted from sedimentary rocks formed from sediments deposited by marine, glacial and freshwater sources between 355 and 180 million years ago. The relief has been modified over time by several ice ages, forming cirques, horn peaks, aretes and glacial troughs.

==Flora and fauna==

The varied vegetation includes wet eucalypt forests, mixed forests dominated by stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot;), rainforests, sub-alpine and alpine forests. The rainforest communities are dominated by myrtle (&quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot;), sassafras (&quot;Atherosperma moschatum&quot;), leatherwood (&quot;Eucryphia lucida&quot;) and native laurel (&quot;Anopterus glandulosus&quot;). The sub-alpine forests are dominated by three eucalypt types: snow gum (&quot;Eucalyptus coccifera&quot;), varnished gum (&quot;E. vernicosa&quot;), Australia&#x27;s smallest eucalypt, and yellow gum (&quot;E. subcrenulata&quot;). Much of the understorey is made of heath plants, including the Tasmanian waratah (&quot;Telopea truncata&quot;).

Most mammals in the park are nocturnal, and include Bennett&#x27;s wallabies, Tasmanian pademelons, brushtail possums, echidnas and platypus.
Among amphibians outstanding is the moss froglet which was discovered at Hartz Mountains in 1992. Some of the common birds in the park include the eastern spinebill, green rosella, forest raven and several honeyeaters.

==Human history==
The area of the park was once inhabited by the Mellukerdee aboriginal people. The first Europeans came to the area in the 19th century in search of Huon pine timber.

In the 1840s early settlers including the Geeves family founded the township of Geeveston, and laid the first track to the Hartz Mountains. As a result, the area became one of Tasmania&#x27;s earliest popular bushwalking destinations. The increasing popularity of the area for recreation led to it being declared a scenic reserve in 1939. In 1951 it was proclaimed to a national park, and in 1989 it was included in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.

==Climate==
The Hartz Mountains area experiences typical south-west weather conditions. In all seasons there can be snow, chilling rains, low temperatures, strong winds, upslope fog and sudden weather changes.

Climate data for the region are sourced from Keoghs Pimple, at an altitude of and operating since 1996. It is an extremely rainy climate with 252 such days per annum, though which tends to fall as light showers or drizzle, with frequent snowfalls that can occur at any time of the year. The mean afternoon relative humidity, is likewise extraordinary.

<text>The Kent Group are a grouping of six granite islands located in Bass Strait, north-west of the Furneaux Group in Tasmania, Australia. Collectively, the group is comprised within the Kent Group National Park.

The islands were named Kent&#x27;s Group by Matthew Flinders, &quot;in honour of my friend captain William Kent, then commander of &quot;Supply&quot;&quot; when Flinders passed them on 8 February 1798 in &quot;Francis&quot; (on her way to salvage &quot;Sydney Cove&quot;). The largest island in the group is Deal Island; the others, in order of descending size, are Erith Island, Dover Island, North East Isle, South West Isle and Judgement Rocks.

==History==
Seal hunting took place on the islands from at least 1803.

==Shipwrecks==
Murray Pass, named for the explorer John Murray, between Deal and Erith Islands has long been used by ships to shelter from gales in Bass Strait, but it is a dangerous, partly open, roadstead, and many ships have been wrecked after sudden changes in wind direction and speed. Others have hit the island either while attempting to shelter or through poor navigation in darkness or bad weather, several with heavy loss of life. They include:

* 1816, &quot;Brothers&quot;, schooner, 40 tons, Captain William Hovell, one life lost.
* 1819, &quot;Daphne&quot;, brig, 151 tons, Captain John Howard, no lives lost.
* 1819, &quot;John Palmer&quot;, schooner, 37 tons, Captain Bastian, two lives lost (one ex &quot;Daphne&quot;) 
* 1831, &quot;Ionia&quot;, snow, 226 tons, Captain Buck. ?Three lives lost.
* 1850, &quot;Ida&quot;, schooner, 50 tons, no loss of life.
* 1851, &quot;White Squall&quot;, schooner, 104 tons, Captain Chattock, no loss of life.
* 1852, &quot;Dorset&quot;, brig, 82 tons, Captain Birdwood, no loss of life.
* 1852, &quot;Mary&quot;, brig, 308 tons, no loss of life.
* 1855, &quot;Elizabeth Mason&quot;, schooner, 79 tons, Captain McIntyre, no loss of life.
* 1856, &quot;Kendall&quot;, schooner, 157 tons, Captain Read, no lives lost.
* 1862, &quot;Reindeer&quot;, schooner, 104 tons, Captain Morris, all hands (about 8) lost.
* 1863, &quot;General Jessup&quot;, barque, 193 tons, Captain Hodge, no loss of life.
* 1866, &quot;Boscarne&quot;, schooner, 63 tons, Captain Black, no loss of life.
* 1875, &quot;Essie Black&quot;, barque, 281 tons, Captain Sivier, all hands (about 10) lost.
* 1877, &quot;Bulli&quot;, iron steamship, 524 tons, Captain Randell, no loss of life (a popular dive wreck).
* 1921, &quot;Karitane&quot;, steel steamship, 1376 tons, Captain Spain, no loss of life.
* 1930, &quot;Ida N&quot;, new fishing boat, 25 tons, Captain Busk, no lives lost.
* 1961, &quot;St Nicholas&quot;, newly completed fish carrier, 45 tons, no loss of life.

<doc id="101799" wikidata="Q827526" url="?curid=101799" title="Mole Creek Karst National Park">
<text>Mole Creek Karst is a national park situated in the North of Tasmania, Australia, 168 km northwest of Hobart. It is located on the slopes of the Great Western Tiers to the east of the town of Mole Creek. It is the only national park in Tasmania created specifically to protect karst landforms. It is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Site.

The national park comprises twelve separate blocks of land, some of which are completely surrounded by cleared, private land, and many of which whose karst features and cave entrances are located outside the bounds of the national park.

The Mole Creek Karst National Park is characterised by its numerous and spectacular cave networks, which attract many tourists each year. Two of these particular caves; King Solomons cave, which features an extensive network of sediment and bone deposit, as well as shawls, and speleothems which make up stalactites and stalagmites., as well as the Marakoopa cave; which is popular for its fantastic glow worm display, and features two underground streams, large caverns, rim pools, reflections and shawl and flowstone features, have been developed as very successful show caves and are the main attraction of the guided cave tours. Many of the caves within the national park remain underdeveloped and are not promoted, although they are visited by the occasional recreational caver. Many other caves are located on private land, and therefore pose an issue in regards to management and conservation.

The national park was declared in 1996 to provide protection for an extensive system of over 300 known caves and sinkholes, including Marakoopa and King Solomons Cave.

The national park is categorised as an IUCN Category II protected area.

==Ecology==
The Mole Creek Karst National Park features a wide range of flora and fauna, of varying conservation status. These species are contained both in the caves, and in the surrounding forests within the national park. Many of the species present, especially in the caves, are endemic to the area, and therefore are very important in regards to conservation and protection.

There are many animal species present in the Mole Creek Karst National Park that are both unique to the Karst system, and listed as protected cave species.
The glow worms Arachnocampus tasmaniensis inhabit many of the caves present in the Mole Creek Karst National Park, and also provide one of the main tourist attractions to the area. The Marakoopa Cave houses one of the most spectacular glow-worm displays in the entire system, and is a major tourist attraction on the guided cave tours.

The karst system is also home to many other protected cave species, such as crickets &quot;Micropathus cavernicola&quot;, and &quot;Parvotettix geode&quot;; beetles, &quot;Tasmanotrechus cockerilli&quot;; harvestman, &quot;Hickmanoxyomma gibbergunyar&quot;; and &quot;pseudoscorpions Pseudotyrannochthonius typhlus&quot;.
Three species present in the system, listed on the Tasmanian &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot;, are endemic to the area and confined to the cave systems. &quot;Tasmanotrechus cockerilli&quot;, a beetle present in the cave systems is a rare and highly cave modified beetle, having evolved to live in a dark cave environment, its eyes have become vestigial. &quot;T. cockerilli&quot; belongs to the Tribe &quot;Trechinae&quot; (Family &quot;Carabidae&quot;) and is listed as vulnerable on the &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot;.

Pseudotyrannochthonius typhlus, is known as the Mole Creek Cave Pseudoscorpion, and is an incredibly rare animal that makes its home in caves within the Mole Creek karst system. It is known from only about a dozen specimens, and is very rarely sighted. It is listed as rare on the &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot;.

Finally, &quot;Hickmanoxyomma gibbergunyar&quot; also known as the Mole Creek Cave Harvestman is a troglobite species, present in many of the cave systems in the Mole Creek area, and is endemic to the Mole Creek Karst. This species is also listed as rare by the Tasmanian &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot;.

There is a variety of bacteria, algae and fungi associated with the caves which are believed to be involved in crystalline and amorphous speleothem germination and growth.

The following is a list of some of the species within the Mole Creek Karst National Park; both within the caves, and in the surrounding forests. The following species are considered endangered, vulnerable and rare by the &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot;.

*&quot;Accipiter novaehollandiae&quot; (Grey Goshawk) Endangered 
*&quot;Parameles gunnii gunnii&quot; (Eastern Barred Bandicoot) Vulnerable
*&quot;Aquila audax fleayi&quot; (Wedge-Tailed Eagle) Endangered 
*&quot;Pseudotyrannochthonius typhlus&quot; (Cave Pseudoscorpion (Mole Creek)) Rare
*&quot;Astacopsis gouldi&quot; (Giant Freshwater Crayfish) Vulnerable
*&quot;Tasmanotrechus cockerilli&quot; (Cave Beetle (Mole Creek)) Rare
*&quot;Hickmanoxyomma gibbergunyar&quot; (Cave Harvestman) Rare

The Giant Freshwater Crayfish species &quot;Astacopsis gouldi&quot; is also considered vulnerable by the Australian &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;.

===Flora===
There is a diverse range of flora in the national park, suited to many different habitats due to the wide variance of different habitats and conditions present.

Forested areas are dominated by brown-top stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot;), white-top stringybark (&quot;E. delegatensis&quot;), swamp gum (&quot;E. regnans&quot;), black gum (&quot;E. ovata&quot;), white gum (&quot;E. viminalis&quot;), black peppermint (&quot;E. amygdalina&quot;) and silver wattle (&quot;Acacia dealbata&quot;), while the underbrush of the forests is mainly shrubby.

Some of the national park has been affected by its surrounding rural environment, as blocks of flora have been modified by fire regimes and grazing on private land. Due to this some of the more burnt areas are open and dominated by sedges and ferns.

There are many sinkholes present in areas of the national park, and many of these are associated with &quot;Sphagnum&quot; peatlands that are found scattered amongst eucalyptus forests.

The following list of flora species, located in the Mole Creek Karst National Park are considered by the &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot; (Tas), to be vulnerable and rare respectively.

*&quot;Acacia mucronata var. dependens&quot; (Variable sallow wattle) Rare 
*&quot;Glycine microphylla&quot; (small-leaf glycine) Vulnerable
*&quot;Desmodium gunni&quot; (slender tick trefoil) Vulnerable
*&quot;Pimelea pauciflora&quot; (Poison rice flower) Rare
*&quot;Epacris exserta&quot; (South Esk heath) Vulnerable 
*&quot;Pomaderris phylicifolia subsp. Phylicifolia&quot; (Narrow leaf pomaderris) Rare

South Esk heath (&quot;Epacris exserta&quot;) is also determined by the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; to be endangered.

===Tourism in the Mole Creek Karst National Park===

Tourism is somewhat of a double-edged blade in this national park. While tourism is an important form of revenue to ensure ongoing care and maintenance of the park, as well as an important aspect of education regarding the natural world, and conservation of the flora and fauna within the Mole Creek Karst National Park, it is also by far the greatest threat. Much of the touristic value of the Mole Creek Karst National Park comes from the cave systems. The environment within these cave systems is very stable and closed, and the impact that increase human activity has already had, and will continue to have could be devastating for the long-term survival and success for many flora and fauna species, and fantastic natural wonders present within these caves.

Cave-dwelling species present in the cave systems are easily damaged or killed by cave visitors. People visiting the caves can crush, damage and destroy food sources and important habitats of cave-dwelling species, and also potentially kill rare and endangered species dwelling in the caves. Trampling of floors by large quantities of visitors also hard pack the dirt rendering it unsuitable as habitat for species.

One aspect that draws tourists every year are the fantastic formation of speleothems present in the cave, otherwise known as stalagmites and stalactites, well as the sparkling calcite that adorns many of the cave walls. However, these beautiful natural formations are delicate and easily damaged and destroyed. Visitors in Georgies Hall, Honeycomb 1 cave and Tailender Cave have already caused serious, and in some cases, irreparable damage to speleothems and calcite formations in the caves, by tracking mud and dirt across the delicate surfaces by not sticking to marked paths, or due to irresponsible cave exploring.

Mud and dirt, deposits of hair, lint from clothing and skin follicles, and excess nutrients trekked in from the outside world build up in the caves due to them being cut-off from the outside world. These foreign objects can also destroy the fragile microclimate within the caves, as well as damage unique cave formations, flora, and habitat for fauna.

A large aspect of tourism that effects cave environments is the need to build structures, and provide lighting in order to accommodate tourists and visitors. The building of infrastructure and installation of lights and ventilation necessary to accommodate tourists has been linked to severe changes in the delicate microclimates within caves. These changes in microclimate can be devastating, and in fact have been shown to adversely affect the organisms living in the caves. The Glow Worm cave in New Zealand was closed for 4 months, after approximately only four percent of the glow worm population in the cave had their lights on. It was found to be caused by increased air flow causing a reduction in humidity and increased evaporation. This is an example of the fickle nature of a caves microclimate, and how important it is to the species who rely on it.

It has also been found the fluctuating light levels due to the inclusion of lighting systems in caves to aid in visibility for human access can have detrimental effects on the organisms within a cave. It has been found that the exposure to light can cause glow worms to dim their display, which holds potential detrimental effects to tourism built on glow worm show caves. Another detrimental effect of artificial lights is that they have been seen to cause algae and cyanobacteria to grow in places that they would not usually grow, and the organic acid produced when they grow can potentially damage speleothems and cave paintings.

The presence of humans alone is enough to influence the microclimate of a cave. Carbon dioxide and water are expelled by groups of cave visitors, and as caves are closed systems, these gases accumulate. Banbury and de Freitas found that carbon dioxide builds up in caves over time, and can reach levels that are dangerous for humans. It was also found by Sarbu and Lascu that increased condensation due to increased water vapour has been shown to degrade speleothems. The temperature of a cave can also be greatly altered by the energy given off as body heat and from lights present in the cave system.

===Future success of conservation=== 
The future success of the Mole Creek Karst National Park as both a tourist attraction, and as a conservation refuge is dependent on a combination of management and protection practices.

====Education====
The most successful avenue to the continued protection and conservation of the national park and the cave systems, is the education of the public that use them. Much of the physical degradation and damage to cave systems is due to the lack of knowledge of proper conservation minded caving exploration by the people visiting the caves. Providing education in the form of guided tours; which already exist for some of the caves, with tour guides or are knowledgeable and passionate about the conservation of the unique cave flora and fauna, will be a worthwhile aspect in improving education of the delicacy of the cave ecosystems.

Providing signage containing information of the cave species present, their significance to the ecosystem and their delicate nature would help keep the public mindful to take care when exploring caves.

====Restoration and management====
Proper restoration and construction of barriers and marked paths within the caves is an important aspect of cave protection and conservation. By marking paths clearly within caves, and roping off areas of significant known fragility, it can be ensured that visitors do not damage or degrade the habitat of cave-dwelling organisms, or the fantastic natural speleothem sand calcite structures present in the caves.

====Observation====
Monitoring systems to assess the changes in baseline microclimate aspects would also be a worthwhile investment in the continued protection of fragile cave ecosystems. Timely knowledge of changes in air pressure or intensity, condensation and humidity levels, and temperature of caves could help to thwart potentially catastrophic effects to cave-dwelling organisms caused by changes in their microclimate.

====Importance of preservation==== 
The caves present in the Mole Creek Karst National Park are significantly important in scientific, conservation and recreational aspects. For the purpose of scientific importance and conservation, the caves in the national park contain rare fauna, which exist only in these caves, as well as an entire ecosystem of unique cave-dwelling organisms completely dependent and constrained to the cave systems. These organisms can live only in the caves, and as such, the caves need to be preserved in order to ensure the continued preservation of the organisms they contain. The national park draws visitors from all around the world, and the revenue garnered from their stay helps fund the continued conservation and protection of the Mole Creek Karst National Park.

The national park itself as an entirety contains a wide and diverse range of flora, fauna and landforms, many of which are rare, threatened or endangered. It also possesses many unique natural wonders, such as the karst landscape and its extensive cave network. Protection of the national park ensures the preservation of these species and unique landforms, to be studied and enjoyed by future generations. These aspects are important for no reason other than their own intrinsic value, and inherent uniqueness and beauty, and the continued preservation will ensure it can be enjoyed for generations to come.

<doc id="101800" wikidata="Q1905973" url="?curid=101800" title="Mount Field National Park">
<text>Mount Field National Park is a national park in Tasmania, Australia, 64 km northwest of Hobart. The landscape ranges from eucalyptus temperate rainforest to alpine moorland, rising to 1,434 metres (4,705 ft) at the summit of Mount Field West.

==History==
Mount Field National Park was founded in 1916, making it, along with Freycinet National Park, Tasmania&#x27;s oldest national park. 

The area around Russell Falls has been protected for its natural beauty since 1885, when it was set aside as Tasmania&#x27;s first nature reserve. The last known wild thylacine was captured in the region in 1933. The reserve was called &quot;National Park&quot; before 1946, but was officially renamed to its present name in 1947.

==Etymology==
Mount Field National Park was named for Judge Barron Field, who visited Tasmania as an itinerant judge in 1819 and 1821.

==Geology==
During the Pleistocene period, a snowfield covered the top of the Mount Field plateau and fed glaciers in the surrounding valleys. A large, 12 km long glacier formed the broad river valley and the cirque walls above Lake Seal. Twisted Tarn, Twilight Tarn, and the tarns on the tarn shelf were formed by glacial scouring. A glacier flowed south from the Rodway Range, forming lakes Belcher and Belton, and north to form the Hayes Valley and Lake Hayes.

In alpine areas podzolic, humus and leached soil is most common. The podzols often occur on deep periglacial solifluction deposits down to . Alluvial floodplains have developed in the lower park on deposits of quaternary alluvium.

==Fauna==
The park has good representation of much of native Tasmanian fauna including wombats, platypuses, eastern barred bandicoots, echidnas, and the Tasmanian devil.

==Fungi==

Mount Field National Park is also home to an enormous diversity of fungi. Fungi are ecologically important and megadiverse, yet their significance in underpinning the terrestrial ecology of the Park is little recognised.

While the Management Plan for Mt Field National Park only mentions fungi in the context of their destructive effects (&quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; and &quot;Chalara australis&quot;), the Park has a great variety of fungi that perform beneficial ecological roles. In fact, most fungi perform positive rather than negative roles. Even parasitic fungi – often regarded only negatively – are a vital part of healthy ecosystems, regulating ecosystem functions. 

As primary recyclers of organic matter, saprobic fungi break down fallen branches and leaf litter, making vital nutrients available to other organisms. Other fungi form symbiotic relationships with other organisms. Although rarely acknowledged, the great majority of plants in Mount Field National Park (indeed in the world) form mutually beneficial mycorrhizal relationships with fungi.

Given the great diversity of plants, specialist habitats and micro-climates in the park, a great diversity of fungi, including lichens, is also expected to occur there. Two hundred and eighty-nine species have already been recorded by field naturalists and interested individuals and a list can be found in the Atlas of Living Australia. 

The Green Elfcup (&quot;Chlorociboria aeruginascens group&quot;) is found growing on rotten wood in wetter parts of the park. Even when its fruitbodies are not conspicuous, its presence can often be detected by the blue-green staining of the wood it inhabits. The Slimy Yellow Cortinar (&quot;Cortinarius sinapicolor&quot;) is one of the more commonly encountered species that forms mycorrhizal relationships with various Eucalyptus species and is recognisable by its viscous sulphur-yellow fruit bodies. The Australian citizen-science organisation, Fungimap is documenting and mapping the distribution of fungi including those that occur in National Parks.

Despite their essential roles in supporting ecosystems, fungi are barely recognised as a vital part of Australia&#x27;s biodiversity. Although Australia has national and state level biodiversity conservation strategies and has ratified international conventions, most overlook fungi, including Tasmania&#x27;s Natural Heritage Strategy, which only makes one generic reference to fungi.

==Accommodation and facilities==
There is camping, with powered and unpowered sites at the entrance to the Park, as well as the Government-owned Lake Dobson cabins near the end of the access road within the Park. Several private ski/walking clubs have private huts, and a ski-lodge on the ski slopes has limited accommodation during the skiing season.

The Visitor Centre located near the entrance to the Park houses an interpretive centre, cafe, gift shop, gallery and public toilets.

Beside the Visitor Centre there are picnic and barbecue facilities, as well as a playground and public toilets.

==Activities==
From the visitor centre:
* Russell Falls is an easy, 20-minute return walk on asphalt and boardwalks.
* Horseshoe Falls is a 30-minute walk.
*The Lady Barron Falls circuit (via Russell Falls and Horseshoe Falls) is approximately two hours return.
*Tall Trees Walk is an easy thirty-minute walk through the tall swamp gums.

Walks from the Lake Dobson car park include:

*The Ski Lodge and Lake Seal lookout, one hour return
*Seagers Lookout, two hours return
*Mount Field East via Lake Nicholls, five hours return
*Mount Field West, eight hours return
*Tarn Shelf, Lake Newdegate, Twilight Tarn and Lake Webster circuit, six hours return

Mount Field National park has one of Tasmania&#x27;s downhill skiing areas. There are three ski tows, two on Mount Mawson and one on the Rodway range. There is generally sufficient snow cover for skiing from mid July to mid September.

<doc id="101802" wikidata="Q1465468" url="?curid=101802" title="Narawntapu National Park">
<text>Narawntapu National Park (formerly known as Asbestos Range National Park) is a national park in the Australian state of Tasmania. It lies on Tasmania&#x27;s north coast, adjoining Bass Strait, between Port Sorell in the west and the mouth of the Tamar River in the east. It lies about 20 km east of Devonport, 60 km north-west of Launceston and 250 km north of Hobart.

Narawntapu encompasses islands in the Port Sorell estuary and the Carbuncle, as well as land extending to low water mark, including intertidal mudflats. The highest point of the park is 392 m ASL. It is listed on Australia&#x27;s Register of the National Estate.

Narawntapu is popular with visitors, with many coming from the tourist centres of Devonport and Port Sorell. The visitor centre is located in an area known as Springlawn, where visitors can see Forester kangaroos, Bennett&#x27;s wallabies, Tasmanian pademelons grazing in the open plain.

==History==
The park was originally reserved, as the Asbestos Range National Park, on 29 June 1976. The name was changed to Narawntapu in 2000 because of concerns that the word &#x27;Asbestos&#x27; was deterring potential visitors. &#x27;Narawntapu&#x27; is of Tasmanian Aboriginal origin, referring to the coastal promontories West Head and Badger Head within the park.

==Climate==
Narawntapu has a temperate maritime climate with an annual, mainly winter, rainfall of 750 mm. The prevailing winds are from the north-east and north-west. Mean temperatures are 17°C in January and 9°C in July.

==Flora and fauna==

Vegetation communities represented in the park include coastal heathland, dry sclerophyll woodland, herbland, grassland and salt marsh. The rare pygmy clubmoss has been recorded from the park.

A feature of the park is the high density of marsupials present. In addition to kangaroos, wallabies and pademelons, one can find also common wombats and Tasmanian devils. Eastern and spotted-tail quolls live in the area, as well as platypuses and echidnas. The birdlife is rich and includes threatened species such as the hooded plover, Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle and swift parrot. The intertidal mudflats in the North East Arm area of the park are an important foraging area for migratory waders, and form part of the Rubicon Estuary Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of their importance for pied oystercatchers.

There is also a rich diversity of birdlife in the land surrounding the wetlands. At certain times of the year, several species of ducks, as well as herons, swans, cormorants, coots, bitterns and grebes call the lagoon home.

In 2019, the population of wombats had been reduced to between 3 and 10 individuals following an outbreak of mange that began in 2010. Scientists implemented a drench technique at burrow entrances to treat the animals. The treatment contained the disease for a short while but ultimately all of the mange-infected wombats died.

<text>Rocky Cape National Park is a national park on the North West Coast of Tasmania, Australia. It is located at a geographical headland and surrounds the town of Sisters Beach. It is located approximately 365 km by car northwest of State Capital Hobart. In 2016, the official name of the cape (but not the park) was changed to pinmatik / Rocky Cape.

Evidence of Aboriginal occupation dating from 8000 years ago was found by Rhys Jones in the 1960s. The Rocky Cape Lighthouse was erected in 1968.

A research by Melbourne&#x27;s Monash University found that Rocky Cape National Park is home to some rocks that are thought to be from the Grand Canyon in Arizona. It suggested that Tasmania was once connected to the West Coast of the US.

<text>Savage River National Park is located in north-west Tasmania, Australia. Established in April 1999, it is the largest undisturbed area of temperate rainforest in Australia. Unlike other national parks of Tasmania, Savage River National Park remains inaccessible to the public, there is no road access or facilities in the park. It is buffered by the Savage River Regional Reserve which has limited 4WD access.

The national park is dominated by cool temperate rainforest with extensive stands of myrtle beech dominated rainforest. A significant component of wet scrubland and buttongrass moorland dominate the Baretop Ridge. The park provides valuable habitat for many species of fauna including the Tasmanian devil, dusky antechinus, broad-toothed mouse, wedge-tailed eagle, swift parrot, grey goshawk and the giant freshwater crayfish.

<doc id="101805" wikidata="Q830099" url="?curid=101805" title="South Bruny National Park">
<text>The South Bruny National Park is a national park located on Bruny Island, Tasmania, Australia, about south of Hobart. The park contains the Cape Bruny Lighthouse. The highest point of the park is Mount Bruny at .

==History==
The park also embraces the Labillardiere Peninsula, named in honour of the French botanist Jacques Labillardière, author of the first general flora of Australia and a member of Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux&#x27;s expedition. The Nuenonne people once occupied South Bruny and there are several cultural sites around the national park, all of which are protected and some of which are publicized. Dolerite cliffs categorize part of the dramatic coastline, with continuous expanses of beaches from Fluted Cape to the southern tip, continuing around Cloudy Bay, and encompass the whole southern part of Great Taylors Bay. South Bruny was declared a National Park in 1997, mostly for its coastal scenery, as well as Aboriginal and historic heritage and to protect a number of threatened species endemic to the area. The park has become a popular tourist destination enhanced by its abundant birdlife and coastal heathlands. A number of smaller islands were also reserved for their ecological significance including Partridge Island, Green Island and The Friars.

==Flora==
Plant communities in the park are of high conservation value due to the occurrence of geographically significant species endemic to the island and not protected by reserves or parks elsewhere in Tasmania. Much of the park&#x27;s vegetation comprises dry sclerophyll communities such as eucalypt woodland as well as heathland and coastal communities. There are also small patches of wet eucalypt forest and temperate rainforest. Common coastal plants include she-oaks and casuarinas (&quot;Allocasuarina&quot;), which have a high tolerance to salt spray and wind. The national park contains several rare, endemic orchid species including the endangered chestnut leek orchid (&quot;Prasophyllum castaneum&quot;) and the pretty leek orchid (&quot;Prasophyllum pulchellum&quot;), both of which are of high ecological significance due to their rare occurrence. These species generally occur in heathland communities which are greatly diverse and are of high conservation significance. The pretty leek orchid thrives in damp heathland and is so rare that the largest of the five known populations consists of fifty individuals. Several other heath species are classified as rare and vulnerable including the juniper wattle (&quot;Acacia ulicifolia&quot;), variable smoke bush (&quot;Conospermum hookeri&quot;), and the yellow onion orchid (&quot;Microtis atrata).&quot;

Eucalyptus forests within the national park play an important role in creating habitat for many species of insects, birds and mammals. Common species are brown-top stringy bark (&quot;Eucalyptus oblique&quot;) with pockets of white gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), blue gum (&quot;Eucalyptus globules ) and&quot; white peppermint (&quot;Eucalyptus pulchella&quot;). The eyebright (&quot;Euphrasia fragosa&quot;) is another species of particular note; the park is one of the few places the plant occurs with only three other known populations, and is the only place where it is protected in a national park or reserve. The eyebright is a small flowering perennial occurring in open woodland and is highly vulnerable to disturbance where it exists on vehicle tracks and grazing areas.

==Fauna==

Common mammals in the park include the Bennett&#x27;s wallaby (&quot;Macropus rufogriseus&quot;), common brush tail possum (&quot;Trichosurus&quot; &quot;vulpecula&quot;) and Tasmanian pademelon (&quot;Thylogale billardierii&quot;). The Bennett&#x27;s wallaby is fairly prevalent throughout Tasmania, however the national park protects a small population of unusual white Bennett&#x27;s wallabies. The Bennett&#x27;s wallaby, also referred to as the red-necked wallaby, can be found grazing on grasslands around the Fluted Cape area and are nocturnal. The eastern quoll (&quot;Dasyurus viverrinus&quot;) has also been reported. Spotted-tail quolls (&quot;Dasyurus maculates&quot;), Tasmanian devils (&quot;Sarcophilus harrisii&quot;), and common wombats (&quot;Vombatus ursinus&quot;) have always been absent from the island. All twelve of Tasmania&#x27;s endemic bird species are present, notably the forty-spotted pardalote (&quot;pardalotus quadragintus&quot;) for which the island is the main stronghold. Little penguins (&quot;Eudyptula minor&quot;) and hooded plovers (&quot;Thinornis rubicollis&quot;) also breed along the coast. Reptiles recorded include the tiger snake (&quot;Notechis scutatus&quot;), lowland copperhead (&quot;Austrelaps superbus&quot;) and white-lipped snake (&quot;Drysdalia coronoides&quot;). A colony of Australian fur seals (&quot;Arctocephalus pusillus&quot;) occupy The Friars; rocks that form the most southerly part of the park where they use the rocks as a ‘haul-out’. The birdlife of the park is of particular significance due to the varied habitats suitable for a rich variety of species.

=== Bird life ===
Several birds of prey exist in South Bruny National Park, including the white-bellied sea eagle (&quot;haliaeetus leucogaster&quot;), the wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax fleayi&quot;) and the grey goshawk (&quot;Accipiter novaehollandiae&quot;). The goshawk is endangered and very rare, and is found on Partridge Island, part of the South Bruny National Park. Also on Partridge island is a breeding penguin colony, the island provides a secluded refuge and ideal habitat for the flightless bird. Nearby Green Island provides the ideal conditions for the kelp gull (&quot;Larus dominicanus&quot;) and is an important breeding ground of which there are very few. The park also supports a rare ground parrot (&quot;Pezoporus wallicus&quot;), which survives in the open heathland. Ground parrots are extremely scarce with only three ground dwelling parrot species in existence, all of which are endangered. The preservation of their habitat is critical to the survival of the species, and the undisturbed heathland of the South Bruny National Park provides this refuge.

==== Forty-spotted pardalote ====
The forty-spotted pardalote is one of the rarest birds in Australia, and is classified as endangered. The distribution of the species has declined over the last century with the bird thought to no longer occupy many parts of Tasmania where it was once prevalent; two populations are now known on Bruny Island. The pardalote’s rely on the white gum (Eucalyptus &quot;viminalis&quot;) for survival and feed on small insects and manna (sap like sugary substance produced by white gums). The pardalote prefers old growth hollows and logs for breeding and nesting, sites of newer growth have shown to be unsuitable with the pardalote showing disinterest.

The numbers of forty-spotted pardalote&#x27;s are still declining despite a number of rescue efforts. There are several factors preventing their abundance such as low dispersal, specialized diet and habitat, and competition with other birds that have established following land clearing. The primary threat to the species is clearing resulting in habitat loss; the clearing of dry sclerophyll forest and the key white gum trees along coastal areas has seen these specialists decline in numbers. Over the past ten years habitat destruction has been negligible, particularly with the declaration of the South Bruny National Park and other reserves on Bruny Island, however habitat fragmentation is a persisting issue, as is territory competition with other edge species. A challenge for future conservation of the species is maintaining habitat connectivity and ensuring the persistence of white gums as a core habitat tree. There have been two national recovery plans with the main management objectives being to reestablish white gums, assess more areas for protection, increase knowledge of the species through monitoring, and to educate the community and visitors.

==== Swift parrot ====
The swift parrot (&quot;Lathamus discolor&quot;) is another key species protected by the park; a migratory bird which travels between southeast mainland Australia and Tasmania. Adventure Bay and Cloudy Bay on South Bruny Island have been identified in research for the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment as key sites for the species. The bird nests primarily in blue gums (&quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot;) relying on the trees flowers for its breeding success, with black gums (&quot;Eucalyptus ovate&quot;) also noted as an important food source. Swift parrots nest in tree hollows, usually on upper slopes and ridges in dry eucalypt forest within of the coast, with the total population being estimated at approximately 1,000 pairs.

The decline of the species has been mainly attributed to habitat loss through clearing, resulting in fragmentation and the change in habitat structure. Another threat to the swift parrot is predation by sugar gliders on the mainland, hence why it is so important for the birds to seek refuge on offshore islands where they can breed safely. Some, but not all of the breeding and nesting sites are encompassed by the South Bruny Island National Park, with some land being privately owned and other land forestry owned- which operations are still active on Bruny Island. Approximately 80% of swift parrot habitat occurs outside of protected areas, which is detrimental in the protection of the bird due to its migratory nature, with habitat connectivity being key. The South Bruny National Park offers a vital sanctuary for the parrot by protecting one of its core breeding areas. Management plans have been developed and implemented in the recovery of the bird (the most recent released in 2011), proving successful in increasing the understanding of habitat requirements, improving forestry management, and has helped to establish community and volunteer networks.

== Environmental threats ==
Tourism of Bruny Island has been driven by a demand for natural experiences, which has had both positive and negative impacts on the island. The use of boats and four-wheel drives is popular, and the increased number of vehicles on beaches is having negative implications. A high number of vehicles travel along the Cloudy Bay beaches, which raises concerns for the success of breeding birds such as the hooded plover. Other associated problems with beach driving are loss of vegetation above the high tide mark, soil disturbance, impacts on other ground nesting birds, and the compaction of sand and soil which can have entire ecosystem implications. These dunal communities are also facing decline due to exotic species and legacy impacts of previous human use. Island locals have highlighted that the reason Bruny Island is so attractive is because of its unspoilt natural values, and increased numbers of tourists jeopardizes this, putting pressure on the island and its resources.

The park layout consists of a narrow coastal strip which is reduced to 50 m wide in parts, connecting three different areas which means the park cannot be managed in isolation from its context and wider environmental setting. This poses the threat of losing habitat connectivity as some important habitat areas are on adjacent private property. Collaboration with landowners on species management is therefore important, as is community education to encourage this.

Feral cats are thought to be the most significant predator on the island, with domestic cats and dogs also known to kill wildlife. Hooded plovers and terns that nest along Cloudy Bay’s beaches are particularly vulnerable to predation by cats. Approximately 80% of the feral cats on Bruny Island carry toxoplasmosis (a parasite which infects and kills many animals when bitten), of which marsupials are particularly susceptible. Competition with other invasive species is also of concern, for example the endangered masked owl (&quot;Tyto novaehollandiae castanops&quot;) is forced to compete with feral honeybees and starlings for nest hollows.

== Management ==

The park offers pristine beaches, a scenic environment, and the opportunity for people to relax in the close proximity of wildlife. Visitors can appreciate the natural setting and learn about the parks different environments, with the aim of supporting South Bruny&#x27;s conservation values. To continue to offer and achieve this, management objectives have been established, along with a management plan. Specific management actions have been outlined including erosion control and rehabilitation where vehicles access the beach at Cloudy Corner, as well as minimizing impacts of visitors in limiting numbers to those that are ecologically sustainable.

The Commonwealth &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act&quot; (1999) is at the heart of the federal government’s environmental legislation, providing the legal basis for management and protection of Australia’s threatened species and communities. The South Bruny National Park Management Plan implemented in 2000 aims to protect, maintain and monitor the natural flora and fauna diversity, particularly threatened species. Only species native to the park will be used in any rehabilitation works, and habitat areas for beach breeding birds are to be left undisturbed during breeding season. The parks priorities for flora conservation include sites of the eyebright, old growth forests and grassy forest that provide habitat to the swift parrot and forty-spotted pardalote. Species such as the eyebright and several flowering orchids rely on the disturbance of vegetation and thrive on regular burns which the park has been exposed to for thousands of years. Regular burns do occur in the park; between 2000 and 2010 most of South Bruny has undergone some form of burn off as part of the national park&#x27;s burning regime. A management challenge is meeting the needs of these individual species, which often differ from one another. The &quot;Weed Management Act&quot; (1999) specifies the framework for Tasmania’s weed management, aiming for the control and eradication of declared weeds providing a sustainable approach to Tasmania’s weed management. Reducing the risk of introduction or reintroduction of weeds is also a priority, improving awareness and knowledge of weed issues throughout Bruny Island, with declared weeds carrying legally enforceable action plans for their control. Continued research and monitoring of environmental issues throughout Bruny Island and the National Park will provide the basis for appropriate future management.

<text>Southwest National Park is an Australian national park located in the south-west of Tasmania, bounded by the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park to the north and the Hartz Mountains National Park to the east. It is a part of a chain of national parks and state reserves that make up the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Covering an area of , it is Tasmania&#x27;s largest national park.

The park is well known for its pristine wilderness, remoteness and unpredictable severe weather. The area is largely unaffected by humans. Although evidence shows Aboriginal Tasmanians have visited the area for at least 25,000 years, and European settlers have made occasional forays into the park area since the 19th century, there has been very little permanent habitation and only minimal impact on the natural environment. Within the area there is only one road, to the hydroelectricity township of Strathgordon. The southern and western reaches of the park are far removed from any vehicular access. The only access is by foot, boat, or light aircraft.

The tiny locality of Melaleuca in the extreme south-west provides an airstrip and some very basic facilities, mainly managed by the Parks and Wildlife Service.

==History==

===South West Tasmanian Aboriginal Nation and Black War===
South West Tasmania has been inhabited for approximately 40,000 years, and isolated from mainland Australia since the Bassian Plain flooded 8,000 years ago. 

Tools, bones and fireplaces found in caves in what is now the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park date aboriginal occupation in south-west Tasmania back to at least 34,000 BP. The South West nation was one of nine across the state, and contained four known clans the Mimegin, Lowreenne, Ninene and Needwonne. They were nomadic hunter gatherers, with staple foods including shellfish, crayfish, seals, penguins along the coast, and wallabies, wombats and birds along the buttongrass plains.

There is some evidence to suggest that repeated burning of buttongrass moorlands by the South West Nation has caused it to propagate more widely than is natural. This was done to increase areas where wallabies and wombats can forage for hunting purposes.

European sealers hunted in Tasmania from 1798, shortly followed by settlements around the Derwent River, to the east. Conflict between the aboriginals and Europeans soon followed, cumulating in the Black War and the near-destruction of Aboriginal Tasmanians.

===Early European exploration===

The South West of Tasmania was first seen by Europeans in 1642 by Abel Tasman, but it was not known to be an island until Matthew Flinders and George Bass circumnavigated it 156 years later.

The far south west was first surveyed from land by James Sprent in 1854 when he reached Port Davey, becoming the first European to notice Federation Peak which he dubbed &quot;the Obelisk&quot;. He later published this work as &#x27;Map of Tasmania and Adjacent Islands&#x27;.

===National Park Status===
The core of the national park, an area of surrounding Lake Pedder was first created in 1955, and called the Lake Pedder National Park. It was a glacial outwash lake, which hosted numerous endemic species including the Lake Pedder earthworm and Pedder galaxias. Lake Pedder was famous among bushwalkers for its majesty and unique pink quartz sand. Dr Peter Hay reflected, &quot;Had it still existed, it would have the same sort of status in Australian mythology as other landscape icons like Uluru and Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef.&quot;

In 1968 the Tasmanian Government expanded the area to , renaming it the Southwest National Park. However, it was actually as scenic reserve, with protections removed so that the area could form a catchment of the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commissions (HEC) Upper Gordon River hydro-electric generation scheme. The aim was to increase Tasmania&#x27;s capacity to generate hydro-electricity, and attract secondary industry with the incentive of cheap renewable energy. The original Lake Pedder was controversially flooded in 1972, with the issue attracting attention of environmentalist groups around the state as they unsuccessfully opposed the dam. They later reformed, and successfully halted the Franklin River Dam, the first success of the greens movement in Australia.

In 1976 the national park was extended towards southwest and incorporated most of the Port Davey State Reserve, and continued to expand until it reached its present size in 2000.

The Southwest National Park was a biosphere reserve under the United Nations Biosphere Program from 1977 until its withdrawal from the program in 2002. Its designation as a biosphere reserve was due to the important world heritage values and human use values it contained. Some of these values included being a key breeding zone for the critically endangered Orange-bellied parrot, remnants of Aboriginal occupation and other historic heritage sites such as the Melaleuca – Port Davey Area Plan (Tasmania Parks and Wildlife 2003, p 2). This was followed by a World Heritage listing in 1982 which was then expanded to its current size.
== Climate ==
The climate of the Southwest National Park is renowned for its adverse, often inhospitable conditions across all seasons of the year. As noted by the Melaleuca- Port Davey Area Plan the climate is characterised by high annual rainfall of over 2000mm (as per the Bureau of Meteorology Port Davey station records from 1946 to 2000), often very strong to cyclonic westerly or south-westerly winds, low temperatures, frosts and high incidence of cloud cover.

== Flora ==
Although the climatic conditions of South-West National Park have been considered as rather inhospitable, or too unpredictable or capricious for humans to inhabit, as indicated by only the relatively small township on Strathgordon near the northern boundary of the park, it paradoxically is a major centre of biodiversity, with a number of species endemic to the park itself. This is not so more evident than with the flora that inhabits the national park.

In a rugged landscape dominated by buttongrass moorland, wet Eucalypt forest, coastal and scrub vegetation, the national park is home to 375 species of vascular flora from 84 families which represents up to 20 percent of Tasmania&#x27;s flora. Of these, as noted by Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service (2003, p 19), approximately 118 are endemic to Tasmania alone, with six of them listed as rare or endangered. This includes the King&#x27;s lomatia (&quot;Lomatia tasmanica&quot;) which has been listed as endangered while others such as the blown grass (&quot;Agrostis aequata&quot;), Spring peppercress (&quot;Lepidium flexicaule&quot;) and dune buttercup (&quot;Ranunculus acaulis&quot;) are rare.

The park is also home to several vascular species of plant that are endemic and/or endangered, yet even with the research undertaken, very little is known about the non-vascular or bryophyte species such as mosses, hornworts etcetera. To date up to 128 species have been recorded which again represents 20 percent of the total bryophyte population in Tasmania. Of these six are endemic to the national park, and as noted by Parks and Wildlife Tasmania, eight have also been listed for conservation assessment (that is, whether they are vulnerable, endangered etcetera).

With such a significant number of vascular and non-vascular plant species and communities inhabiting the park, the main concerns to the vegetation within the park, based on carbon content in soils, written records and both current and past pollen spectra records, appears to be fire, which the area has been shown to have a significant record of, and more recently, the threat caused by the root rot fungus &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, particularly to the Buttongrass moorlands. To assist in protecting the national park from such threats, the Parks and Wildlife Service of Tasmania, in conjunction with the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, developed the Melaleuca – Port Davey Area Plan and Strategic Regional Plan for &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; to ensure that &quot;inter alia&quot; regular monitoring and regular hygiene checks of visitors occurred. The hygiene checks were designed to prevent root rot from becoming a significant threat to these flora species and or communities of the park.

==Wildlife==
In an area that is rich in terms of ecological flora communities, the Southwest National Park is also a wilderness area that is uniquely rich in biodiversity in terms of the variety of fauna species that either have all of their Tasmanian population or a majority of their population inhabiting the park. Within this national park alone there are, as noted by Driessen and Mallick 2003, three species of terrestrial mammals, 10 terrestrial bird species, seven reptile species, three frog species, four freshwater fish and or marine fish that are endemic to this 600-thousand-hectare national park.

However, more pertinently the park is an important habitat to several species, including the orange-bellied parrot (&quot;Neophema Chrysogaste&quot;r) and freshwater fish Pedder galaxias (&quot;Galaxias pedderensi&quot;s), that are listed as critically endangered and extinct in the wild respectively under both Australian Commonwealth and Tasmanian legislation.

=== Birds ===
Of the threatened, endangered and the eight species that are simply endemic to the park, such as the fairy tern, wedge-tail eagle, green rosella and dusky robin respectively, the species that adds to the park&#x27;s cultural and conservation uniqueness is the &quot;Neophema Chrysogaster,&quot; or more simply the Orange-bellied Parrot.
As noted under the Commonwealth&#x27;s National Recovery Plan 2016 listed as Critically Endangered under Commonwealth &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;, Endangered under New South Wales &quot;Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995&quot;, South Australia&#x27;s &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot;, Tasmania&#x27;s &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot; and Threatened under Victoria&#x27;s &quot;Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988&quot;. At an international level the species has also been listed as Critically Endangered under International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List (IUCN).

What makes the area unique is that this National Park, or more specifically within 10 kilometres of Melaleuca Lagoon, remains the only known significant breeding ground of this parrot. This occurs primarily between November and March with the birds migrating back to the coast of South-East Australia over winter following a route along the west coast of Tasmania and King Island. This breeding ground remains significant as there are currently only 50 Orange-bellied Parrots remaining in the wild with another 320 in captivity.

Additionally, although the numbers in captivity appear to suggest the program is working, despite efforts made in undertaking the captive breeding program, the breeding success, in particular, the egg fertility and genetic diversity, as noted in the National Recovery Plan, is lower in the captive population than the wild population. As such it has been seen as critically imperative to ensure that the remaining numbers in the wild and quality habitat is retained, particularly in regards to the breeding program. Fortunately, through regular monitoring, supplementary feeding, artificial nest boxes and protection of their nesting and foraging habitat in the park, this appears to be occurring despite the existing potential threats posed by fire, climate change and damage to habitat.

=== Mammals ===
With the number of mammal species that inhabit the park, the only one that appears threatened is the New Zealand fur seal, which as noted by the Melaleuca-Port Davey Plan, only regularly visits the offshore Maatsuyker Island during the breeding season.

=== Fish ===
Another unique aspect to this park is the freshwater community, particularly the fish. As noted by Tasmania Parks and Wildlife, the aquatic system in the park has had no introduced fish species recorded, which gives it high conservation value as there are few systems in Australia where this has occurred.

Although fish are relatively well studied within the park, that is, 37 percent of species have been discovered once, the numbers and research undertaken suggests that there is potentially a relatively large number of undescribed or undiscovered fish species that are endemic to the park. With such potential for discovery of new species, that alone would indicate that it remains a significant area for increased biodiversity amongst the marine life and warrants conservation.

However, of those fish species discovered such as the cusk-eel (&quot;Microbrotula&quot; sp.) and maugean skate (&quot;Zearaja maugeana&quot;) which are endemic to the park, there is one species of fish, known as the freshwater fish Pedder galaxias (&quot;Galaxias pedderensis&quot;) that has been listed both at a Tasmanian and Commonwealth level as endangered in 1995 and extinct in the wild in 2009 respectively. Once endemic to Lake Pedder within the national park, the Pedder galaxias is unfortunately no longer found within the park with the population only found at two translocations which were part of conservation management program undertaken in the 1980s to protect the species. Alongside the now extinct Thylacine in Tasmania, this case is indicative of ensuring that conservation measures are taken to protect species that are endemic to a particular area and have high conservation value, such as the Southwest National Park.

=== Reptiles and amphibians ===
Alongside a number of bird and mammal species, there are several reptile and frog species that are uniquely endemic to the park alone. These include three reptiles, the Tasmanian tree skink, ocellated skink and she-oak skink, and amongst the frogs, the Tasmanian tree frog, Tasmanian froglet and recently discovered moss froglet.

== Environmental problems and threats ==
Even with such unique biodiversity amongst both the flora and fauna, there still exists environmental problems that threatened the conservation of that biodiversity within the park.

Of primary concern, like many conservation areas, is climate change. Changing temperature and rainfall patterns has caused drought, an increase in dry lightning induced fires, decreased vegetation growth and subsequent food supply for endangered species such as the Orange-bellied Parrot. Consequently, as a result of a decrease in food supply, particularly amongst the Buttongrass moorlands, the volunteers under the state program provide supplementary feeds for the endangered Orange-bellied Parrots.

The other major environmental threat is the root rot fungus &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, which has been found at Scotts Peak and Melaleuca. This disease particularly threatens the Buttongrass moorlands that cover a significant part of the park and provide both habitat and feeding grounds for a number of endemic species including birds and amphibians. To assist in preventing the spread of this disease, the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment are working closely with Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife to ensure that no soil with the disease enters the park. This involves measures such as hygiene checks of people&#x27;s boots and clothing, and planes and boats that enter the park. This is done at established stations along the Port Davey Track and the South Coast Track.

== Human impacts ==
In addition to the environmental threats posed by climate change and root rot fungus, there are several other impacts, posed mainly by humans, that threatened the park. Of most concern from humans are the impacts posed from fishing, tourism and introduced pests such as feral cats and starlings into in the park.

=== Fishing ===
Due to the uniqueness of the freshwater and estuarine systems within the park, and wanting to prevent the introduction of pests such as the brown trout, fishing has been banned from the known estuarine and freshwater systems of the park such as Bathurst Harbour, Port Davey and Melaleuca.

=== Eco-tourism ===
To coincide with the threat of fire posed by increased lightning strikes from storms through climate change, the park has alongside all other national parks in Tasmania, introduced through the World Heritage Wilderness Plan 1999 the banning of camp fires and declaring the parks Fuel Stove Only Areas, to minimise the impact caused through walkers using the tracks and other eco-tourist ventures that utilise the park, particularly during the warmer months of October through to March.

=== Introduced species ===
Alongside the threat posed by humans through fishing, walking and other eco-tourist ventures, particularly in terms of threats from fire and litter, these ventures also posed a threat in terms of introduced species or pests such as feral cats, brown trout and starlings into the park which threaten particularly the herbivore mammals, birds, fish and reptiles that are endemic to the park.

Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Services have attempted to address this threat through the Tasmania World Heritage Wilderness Plan, the Strategic Regional Plan for the root rot fungus and Port-Davey and Melaleuca Area Plan. The management strategies that have been enforced include &quot;inter alia&quot;, development and enforcement of a weed management plan, undertake regular checks of boats and aircraft entering the park, cleaning stations located at several spots along the walking tracks of Port Davey and South Coast and regular inspections and reviews of the houses and walker&#x27;s huts within the park.

It is with these strategies that will hopefully ensure that the unique biodiversity of this World Heritage National Park is maintained.

==Access and recreation==
There are two ways to access the park by land: the Gordon River Road to the hydroelectricity township of Strathgordon and the Cockle Creek route via the Huon Highway. The southern and western reaches of the park are far removed from any vehicular access. The only access is by foot, boat, or light aircraft.
Two main walking tracks cross the park: the Port Davey Track, south from Lake Pedder and the South Coast Track, east from Cockle Creek, the other west from Cockle Creek along Tasmania&#x27;s south-coast to Melaleuca. The walks are generally for more experienced walkers, taking approximately ten to fourteen days to complete the full route. Alternatively, a flight to or from Melaleuca may be arranged to split the walk, or for tourist access for day trips. Several more difficult walks also exist, encompassing the Eastern and Western Arthur Ranges, Precipitous Bluff, Mount Anne the South West Cape, and Federation Peak. Many of these latter routes are not recommended for inexperienced walkers, or for people traveling alone. Sea access to the region is best gained via Port Davey and Bathurst Harbour.

<text>Strzelecki National Park is a national park on Flinders Island, Tasmania (Australia), 307 km north of Hobart. The park is home to abundant wildlife including more than one hundred bird species, wombats, and potoroos. It is named after Sir Paul Edmund Strzelecki, a famous Polish explorer and geologist who made a lot of his explorations on the Australian continent and was proclaimed in 1967.

==Popular activities in the park==
Strzelecki National Park contains the highest point on Flinders Island, Mount Strzelecki, after which it is named; the park contains multiple hiking trails and scenic peaks. The park also contains scenic beaches that are popular spots for swimming, snorkeling, fishing, and kayaking. Additionally, there is a diverse spread of biomes in the park ranging from Tasmanian Blue Gum Forests to coastal heatlands, and the sprawling mountains. It was the also first peak climbed in the Three Peaks Race.

<text>The Tasman National Park is a national park in eastern Tasmania, Australia, approximately east of Hobart. The park is situated on part of both the Forestier and Tasman peninsulas and encompasses all of Tasman Island.

==History==
Whaling activity took place in the 1830s and 1840s.

The prominent cliffs with dolerite columns at Cape Raoul were damaged by gunnery practice by warships of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Australia Station in the late 1800s.

The park was proclaimed under the Regional Forest Agreement on 30 April 1999. The Tasman Island Lighthouse (constructed in 1906) is located on Tasman Island, which is part of the park. This lighthouse and weather station has been unmanned since 1977.

==Geography==
At above sea level, the columnar dolerite cliffs at Cape Pillar and Tasman Island are among the highest in the world. Dolerite is a rare rock type on mainland Australia. Land formations accessible by road include the Blowhole (a hole at the inland end of a sea cave), Devils Kitchen (a rock hole) and Waterfall Bay. Dolerite formations which are more easily viewed from the ocean include Cathedral Rock, Totem Pole, Candlestick, and Tasmans Arch. The park includes The Lanterns, three small islands.

==Flora==
Three species of &quot;Euphrasia&quot; (a semi-parasitic, herbaceous flowering plant commonly known as eyebright) are found only in Tasman National Park. The rare Cape Pillar Sheoak is a shrub or small tree found only in the Tasman National Park where it is restricted to the Cape Pillar area of the Tasman Peninsula and to Tasman Island.

Giant Kelp is locally extinct in Eaglehawk Neck since 2016 due to climate change, with Tasmania&#x27;s remaining giant kelp forests predicted to disappear in the next five to ten years.

==Fauna==
Australian fur seals use the coastline for breeding and resting, and little penguins (sometimes referred to as &quot;blue penguins&quot; or &quot;fairy penguins&quot;) nest along the foreshore.

The park forms part of the South-east Tasmania Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of a range of woodland birds, especially the endangered swift parrot and forty-spotted pardalote.

==Three Capes track==
The Three Capes Track is a one-way 46 km 3 night track in Tasman National Park opened on December 21, 2015. It starts at Port Arthur Historic Sites and ends at Fortescue Bay with a bus taking the walkers back to Port Arthur Historic Sites. The walkers arrive at the jetty at Port Arthur Historic Sites, are taken by boat around the bay of Port Arthur then left at Denmans Cove. From there they trek 46 km to Fortescue Bay over 3 nights, stopping each night at a hut that provides water, gas top cookers, toilets and sleeping. Each hut has one Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Ranger as well as a roving ranger who goes between huts. The huts can accommodate 48 people per night and as of December 2016 has had 8000 participants. The 4 day walk goes to Cape Pillar, Cape Hauy, Mount Fortescue, Arthurs Peak, Ellarwey Valley and ends at Fortescue Bay. The total cost was 25 million AUD including 18000 helicopter flights to the site. Before the new track was created there was already an older and not maintained track that was first created in 1990, with the Three Capes Track first being attempted to be made in the mid to late 1960s&#x27; by members of the Hobart Walkers Club.

<doc id="101809" wikidata="Q385655" url="?curid=101809" title="Walls of Jerusalem National Park">
<text>The Walls of Jerusalem National Park is a national park located in the Central Highlands region of Tasmania, Australia. The park is located approximately northwest of Hobart, east of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, and west of the Central Plateau Conservation Area. It is south of Mole Creek, Tasmania, and Rowallan Lake. The national park forms part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.

The locality of Walls of Jerusalem is in the local government areas of Central Highlands (36%) and Meander Valley (64%) in Tasmania. The locality is about north-west of the town of Hamilton.

==Etymology and history==
The park takes its name from the geological features of the park which are thought to resemble the walls of the city of Jerusalem. As a result, many places and features within the park also have Biblical references for names, such as Herods Gate, Lake Salome, Solomons Jewels, Damascus Gate, the Pool of Bethesda.

==Features==
The most prominent feature of the park is King Davids Peak with an elevation of above sea level.

Much of the walking track consists of raised boards, from Wild Dog Creek through to Dixon&#x27;s Kingdom, with the purpose of protecting the fragile alpine vegetation. Walking tracks elsewhere in the park consist of rock, rocky earth, grassland and marsh.

==In film==
Some scenes for the second episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; were filmed here.

==Geography==
The locality has an area of , all of which is occupied by the national park.

==Road infrastructure==
The C171 route (Mersey Forest Road) runs south just outside the north-western boundary (in the locality of Mersey Forest) to the Walls of Jerusalem car park, where it ends.

<doc id="101812" wikidata="Q1137109" url="?curid=101812" title="Video game publisher">
<text>A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that have been developed either internally by the publisher or externally by a video game developer.

They often finance the development, sometimes by paying a video game developer (the publisher calls this &quot;external development&quot;) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a &quot;studio&quot;. The large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish, while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute the games they publish. Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any licenses that are used by the game; paying for localization; layout, printing, and possibly the writing of the user manual; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design. Some large publishers with vertical structure also own publishing subsidiaries (labels).

Large publishers also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality. Because the publisher often finances development, they usually try to manage development risk along with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the developer&#x27;s progress, critique ongoing development, and assist as necessary. Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties. These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development, called milestones.

==Business risks==
Video game publishing is associated with high risk:
* The Christmas selling season accounts for a highly significant portion of industry sales, leading to a concentrated influx of high-quality competition every year in every game category, all in the fourth quarter of the year.
* Product slippage is common due to the uncertain schedules of software development. Most publishers have suffered a &quot;false launch&quot;, in which the development staff assures the company that game development will be completed by a certain date, and a marketing launch is planned around that date, including advertising commitments, and then after all the advertising is paid for, the development staff announces that the game will &quot;slip&quot;, and will actually be ready several months later than originally intended. When the game finally appears, the effects among consumers of the marketing launch—the excitement and &quot;buzz&quot; over the release of the game, fueling consumers&#x27; intent to purchase—have dissipated, and lackluster interest leads to weak sales. An example of this is the PSP version of &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. These problems are compounded if the game is supposed to ship for the Christmas selling season, but actually slips into the subsequent year. Some developers (notably id and Epic) have alleviated this problem by simply saying that a given game will be released &quot;when it&#x27;s done&quot;, only announcing a definite date once the game is released to manufacturing. However, this sometimes can be problematic as well, as seen with &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;.
* The industry has become more &quot;hit driven&quot; over the past decade. Consumers buy the game that&#x27;s best marketed but not necessarily of the highest quality, therefore buying fewer other games in that genre. This has led to much larger game development budgets, as every game publisher tries to ensure that its game is number 1 in its category. It also caused publishers to on occasion force developers to focus on sequels of successful franchises instead of exploring original IP; some publishers such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts have both attracted criticism for acquiring studios with original games and assigning them to support roles in more mainstream franchises.
* Current generation consoles have more advanced graphic capabilities than previous consoles. Taking advantage of those capabilities requires a larger team-size than games on earlier, simpler consoles. In order to compete with the best games on these consoles, there are more characters to animate; all characters must be modeled with a higher level of detail; more textures must be created; the entire art pipeline must be made more complex to allow the creation of normal maps and more complex programming code is required to simulate physics in the game world, and to render everything as precisely and quickly as possible. On this generation of consoles, games commonly require budgets of US$15 million to $20 million. Activision&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, for example, cost US$35 million to develop, not counting the cost of marketing and sales. Every game financed is, then, a large gamble, and pressure to succeed is high.

:* Contrasting with the big budget titles increased expense of &quot;front-line&quot; console games is the casual game market, in which smaller, simpler games are published for PCs and as downloadable console games. Also, Nintendo&#x27;s Wii console, though debuting in the same generation as the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, requires a smaller development budget, as innovation on the Wii is centered around the use of the Wii Remote and not around the graphics pipeline.
* When publishing for game consoles, game publishers take on the burden of a great deal of inventory risk. All significant console manufacturers since Nintendo with its NES (1985) have monopolized the manufacture of every game made for their console and have required all publishers to pay a royalty for every game so manufactured. This royalty must be paid at the time of manufacturing, as opposed to royalty payments in almost all other industries, where royalties are paid upon actual sales of the product—and, importantly, are payable for games that did not sell to a consumer. So, if a game publisher orders one million copies of its game, but half of them do not sell, the publisher has already paid the full console manufacturer royalty on one million copies of the game and has to absorb that cost.

== Types of game publishers ==
AAA game publishers produce and create games that are high budget and groundbreaking. They are advanced in technology and forward the boundaries of technology and creativity in the video game world. AAA game publishers often produce popular and blockbuster games. These publishers have the financial resource and means to fund large game development projects. These publishers implement and fund marketing and distribution to guarantee reach and exposure for their games. With their funds to market they are able to advertise and reach a wider consumer pool and have access to distribute to a big network. Although they have creative constraints within game development and marketing, they often focus and follow market trends. They have a higher demand to attain commercial success. Examples of AAA video game publishers are Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, and Activision.

Indie game publishers are companies that work with independent developers. Their focus is on developing games that promotes creativity and originality. Developers have creative control over their games. These publishers implement intimate collaborations between the publishers and the developers. Often stand out in the video game market due to the more unique genres. Indie game publishers have restrict marketing budgets and have small audience reach and visibility. Examples of Indie video game publishers are Devolver Digital, Annapurna Interactive and Raw Fury.

Mobile game publishers produce and specialize in video games on smartphones and tablet devices. They take advantage of the widespread appeal and rise of mobile gaming. These publishers enhance games for touch based interfaces and devices. They are proficient in designing monetization tactics for mobile platforms. Mobile game publishers have a comprehensive understanding of the mobile gaming market. They have proficiency in strategies for engagement and user acquisition for mobile sites. For mobile gaming there is access through app stores for distribution channels. There are obstacles with monetization due to lack of in-app purchase and free-to-play(F2P) models. Examples of Mobile game publishers are Supercell, King, and Zynga.

==Investor interest==
Numerous video game publishers are traded publicly on stock markets. As a group, they have had mixed performance. At present, Electronic Arts is the only third-party publisher present in the S&amp;P 500 diversified list of large U.S. corporations; in April 2010, it entered the Fortune 500 for the first time.

Hype over video game publisher stocks has been breathless at two points:
* In the early 1990s, the introduction of CD-ROM computer drives caused hype about a multimedia revolution that would bring interactive entertainment to the masses. Several Hollywood movie studios formed &quot;interactive&quot; divisions to profit in this allegedly booming new media. Most of these divisions later folded after expensively producing several games that were heavy in &quot;full-motion video&quot; content, but light in the quality of gameplay.
* In the United States, revenue from the sales of video and computer games exceeded revenue from film box-office receipts for the first time in the dot-com days of the late 1990s, when technology companies in general were surrounded by hype. The video game publishers did not, however, experience the same level of rise in stock prices that many dot-com companies saw. This was probably because video game publishing was seen as a more mature industry whose prospects were fairly well understood, as opposed to the typical exciting dot-com business model with unknown but possibly sky-high prospects. While many technology stocks were eventually destroyed in the dot-com crash in the early 2000s, the stock prices of the video game publishers recovered as a group; several of the larger publishers such as EA and Take-Two Interactive achieved historical highs in the mid-2000s.

<text>The Family Man is a 2000 American romantic fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Brett Ratner, from a screenplay by David Diamond and David Weissman. The film stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni, with Don Cheadle, Saul Rubinek, and Jeremy Piven in supporting roles.

&quot;The Family Man&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on December 22, 2000, by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $124.7 million worldwide against its $60 million budget. At the 27th Saturn Awards, it was nominated for Best Fantasy Film and won Best Actress for Leoni.

==Plot==
Jack and Kate, who have been together since college, are at JFK Airport, where he is about to leave to take up a twelve-month internship with Barclays in London. She fears the separation will be detrimental to their relationship and asks him not to go, but he reassures her that their love is strong enough to last and that the internship will be beneficial to their future together.

Thirteen years later, Jack is a wealthy bachelor and Wall Street executive in New York City, with millions at his disposal. At work, he is putting together a multi-billion dollar merger and has ordered an emergency meeting on Christmas Day, disregarding his employees&#x27; desires to spend time with their families. In his office, on Christmas Eve, he gets a message to contact Kate. Jack ponders whether Kate is attempting to reconnect, but chooses not to return her call.

On his way home, Jack is in a convenience store when a young man, Cash, enters claiming to have a winning lottery ticket worth $238, but the store clerk refuses him, saying the ticket is a forgery. Cash pulls out a gun, and Jack, trying to defuse the situation, offers to buy the ticket, calling it a “business deal.&quot; Cash eventually agrees.

Outside, Jack patronizingly tries to help Cash, who, feeling like he is being preached to, asks Jack if anything is missing from his own life. When Jack haplessly says he has everything he needs, Cash enigmatically remarks that Jack has &quot;brought this upon himself&quot; and walks away. A puzzled Jack returns to his penthouse to sleep.

Jack wakes up the next morning on Christmas Day in a suburban New Jersey bedroom with Kate and two children. Confused, he rushes out to his home in New York, but the doorman and his neighbor claim not to recognize him. He goes to his office, which is closed for the holiday, and is turned away by security. Outside, he encounters Cash now smartly dressed and driving Jack&#x27;s Ferrari. Although Cash offers to explain what is happening, all he does is make a vague reference to &quot;the organization&quot; and tell Jack that he is getting &quot;a glimpse&quot; of something that will help him to figure out for himself what is important in life.

Jack returns to the house and tries to tell Kate the truth, but she reacts angrily. He receives some help from his young daughter, Annie, who believes Jack is an alien and her real father will soon return. He struggles to adjust to fatherhood and his modest family life, finding that he is a tire salesman working for Kate&#x27;s father and Kate is a non-profit lawyer. When he discovers this is the life he would have had if he had stayed in the U.S. as Kate had asked, he lashes out at Kate and expresses resentment for her holding him back.

Jack later apologizes and grows closer to Annie and her baby brother, Josh, and realises he never fell out of love with Kate. He comes to enjoy his family life and begins succeeding at his sales job. One day his former boss, Peter Lassiter, comes in to have a tire blowout fixed. Taking advantage of the chance meeting, Jack uses his business savvy to impress Lassiter, who invites Jack to his office, where Jack worked in his &#x27;other&#x27; life.

There, after a short interview, Lassiter offers him a position. While he is excited by the potential salary and other perks, including a lavish apartment in Manhattan, Kate is less certain. She expresses deep misgivings about raising their children in the city and leaving their old life behind, telling Jack that they should be thankful for the life they have. Jack found plane ticket and he came back the next day from London and why he and Kate got back together and realize he was happier where he is.

Jack encounters Cash at a grocery store and is frightened by the idea of leaving this life, which he now loves, behind. Cash reminds him that a glimpse, by definition, is an impermanent thing. Jack returns home and watches over his children and then tries to stay awake while watching Kate sleep but eventually does fall asleep and wakes to find he has returned to his old life, on Christmas Day.

Jack returns to the office to close the big acquisition deal, making plans to fly to Aspen to prevent it from failing, but first visits Kate, now an unmarried corporate lawyer, preparing to move to Paris. She only called him to return a box of his old possessions, and when Jack asks her to meet for coffee, she suggests that he look her up if he&#x27;s ever in Paris.

Jack chooses not to go to Aspen and instead chases after Kate to the airport and begs her to stay. She reacts with confusion, as their relationship has been over for more than a decade, and refuses. Jack then describes in detail their life together and their children, saying it was a dream that seemed real and admitting that he can no longer conceive of a life without her. Intrigued, she eventually agrees to go with him for a coffee. From a distance, they are seen talking inaudibly and laughing over their coffees and their possible future.

==Cast==
== Production ==

=== Development ===
Producer Marc Abraham first became aware of the project when veteran producers Alan Riche, Tony Ludwig and Howard Rosenman brought the idea to him as a pitch. He was charmed by the uplifting and universal appeal of the premise, which was reminiscent of many of his favorite films of the 1930s and &#x27;40s. With a solid screenplay by David Diamond and David Weissman in hand, the filmmakers began to look for a director who could properly present the funny, poignant and somewhat quirky elements of the material while maintaining a tone of sincerity throughout. It was essential to everyone involved that the story not pass judgment on either of the two different lifestyles of Jack Campbell presented. &quot;&quot;The Family Man&quot; is not about &quot;good choice vs. bad choice&quot; but rather about the nature of choices themselves&quot; said co-writer Weissman. &quot;The idea was about the path not taken.&quot;

Before Brett Ratner signed on to the project, the film was originally offered to director Curtis Hanson, who accepted. Ratner was in the middle of directing &quot;Rush Hour&quot; when his agent kept offering him scripts to consider directing. Ratner told his agent he was more interested in completing &quot; Rush Hour&quot; but near the end of the shoot for the film, his agent recommended that he read the script for &quot;The Family Man&quot;. Ratner originally wasn&#x27;t interested in directing the film, but after he read the script, he immediately pursued it, saying &quot;It reminded me of the classic films I grew up watching, except it didn&#x27;t end the way most movies end and that was exciting. I felt this one in my gut. I always follow my instincts and I realized this was something that I really had to do.&quot; Ratner was convinced that he was the right choice to direct the film and set his sights on convincing the producers, mostly Abraham.

Abraham, however, wasn&#x27;t sure about Ratner initially. Meanwhile, Hanson left the project to direct &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; instead. According to Abraham, &quot;It just didn&#x27;t seem like his kind of film. But after getting to know him during the entire year he stalked me, I finally figured that maybe he was the right guy for the job. He brought something really original and vibrant to the material&quot;. Ratner was officially signed on as the director after the success of &quot;Rush Hour&quot;.

Like director Ratner, star Nicolas Cage originally wasn&#x27;t interested in doing a lighthearted romantic comedy drama, as he was focused on more serious and complex roles such as in &quot;8mm&quot; and &quot;Bringing out the Dead&quot;. He was also exhausted from filming &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;, but after seeing &quot;Rush Hour&quot; with his father, he accepted the part of Jack Campbell after finding himself inspired by Ratner&#x27;s enthusiasm for the project. With Cage and director Ratner in place, the filmmakers needed to cast the role of Kate Reynolds, which was the most sought-after role for the film but a difficult one to cast. Both the filmmakers and Cage were impressed with Téa Leoni&#x27;s ability to convey the intricate subtleties of the role.

=== Filming ===

Principal photography began on November 19, 1999, in Teaneck, New Jersey and Sleepy Hollow, New York, where fall foliage was still in evidence. Academy Award-winning special effects supervisor John Richardson, and his team had to transform the neighborhoods into a winter wonderland to set the snowbound Christmas scene. Filming finished on March 14, 2000. &quot;The Family Man&quot; was the first collaboration between Ratner and Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Dante Spinotti. They later worked together on &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, &quot;After the Sunset&quot;, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, &quot;Tower Heist&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot;.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Family Man&quot; opened at #3 at the North American box office making $15.1 million in its opening weekend, behind &quot;What Women Want&quot; and &quot;Cast Away&quot;, the latter of which opened at the top spot. After 15 weeks in release, the film grossed $75,793,305 in the US and Canada and $48,951,778 elsewhere, bringing the film&#x27;s worldwide total to $124,745,083.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Family Man&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 54% based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;The Family Man&quot;″s earnest attempt to remind audiences that it&#x27;s a wonderful life too often steers into schmaltz, although Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni&#x27;s romantic rapport adds a dash of sincere sweetness.&quot; Metacritic reports a 42 out of 100 rating based on 28 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Chris Gore from &quot;Film Threat&quot; said: &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for a heartfelt, feel-good holiday movie, just give in and enjoy.&quot; Matthew Turner from &quot;ViewLondon&quot; said: &quot;Perfect feel-good Christmas-period family entertainment. Highly recommended.&quot; Common Sense Media rated it four out of five stars. Movieguide.org rates it four of four stars, noting &quot;&quot;The Family Man&quot; is a heart-rending movie. Very well written, it makes you laugh and cry. Better yet, it’s an intentionally moral movie. It wants to prove that everyone needs love...&quot;

Emma Cochrane from &quot;Empire&quot; in 2015 wrote: &quot;This is exactly the kind of adult fantasy you want to see at Christmas and, as such, it&#x27;s highly enjoyable entertainment&quot;, and gave the film three stars out of five.

<text>Alberti bass is a particular kind of accompaniment figure in music, often used in the Classical era, and sometimes the Romantic era. It was named after Domenico Alberti (1710–1740/46), who used it extensively, although he was not the first to use it.

Alberti bass is a kind of broken chord or arpeggiated accompaniment, where the notes of the chord are presented in the order lowest, highest, middle, highest. This pattern is then repeated several times throughout the music. The broken chord pattern helps to create a smooth, sustained, flowing sound on the piano. &quot;Chords of harmony broken up into short patterns. Steady bass patterns in orchestral music which give the rhythmic drive to Classical music, compensating for the energetic drive of the Baroque basso continuo line.&quot;

Alberti bass is usually found in the left hand of pieces for keyboard instruments, especially for Mozart&#x27;s piano pieces. However, it is also found in pieces for other instruments. It has been described as &quot;a true tolerable monotony,&quot; and as &quot;perhaps the most overworked fixture of eighteenth-century music.&quot;

Well-known examples of Alberti bass include the beginning of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata, K 545, and the third movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Moonlight Sonata. A famous example from 20th-century American popular music is the bass guitar part of the 1962 surf rock standard &quot;Pipeline&quot;, by The Chantays. Alberti bass is also used in the ending theme of Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. 2.

Künast was born in Recklinghausen, North Rhine-Westphalia. She studied social work in Düsseldorf and worked from 1977 to 1979 in this profession in a jailhouse in Berlin. After that she studied law at the Free University of Berlin until 1985. During her student years, she often protested against the Gorleben nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant. She later worked as lawyer specializing on aliens law and criminal law.

==Political career==
===Career in state politics===
Since 1979, Künast has been a member of the German Green Party (&quot;Bündnis 90/Die Grünen&quot;), first in the Alternative List in West Berlin. In the 1990s she was member of parliament and chairwoman of the Green Party&#x27;s group in the state parliament of Berlin. During that time, she won cross-party respect for her leading role in drafting a new democratic constitution for the reunified city-state. Künast eventually became the party&#x27;s spokeswoman for legal issues. In 1998, she re-assumed the floor leadership post alongside Michaele Schreyer.

In national politics, Künast came to be known as a tough negotiator for her work in drafting the national red-green coalition agreement after the 1998 federal parliamentary elections. In October 1999, she was the Green&#x27; front-runner in Berlin&#x27;s state elections.

From June 2000 to March 2001, Künast served as co-chair of &quot;Bündnis 90/Die Grünen&quot; on the national level, together with Fritz Kuhn. 

===Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, 2001–2005===
Künast became Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in the second government of Germany Gerhard Schröder in 2001. Since her party at the time did not allow the combination of functions in the party and the government in one person, she had to resign from her role as the party&#x27;s co-chair.

By naming someone with no experience in farming to head a ministry with such sweeping powers, Schröder was widely considered gambling that any loss of support among farmers would be more than compensated by support from ecologically conscious Germans alarmed by the discovery of mad cow disease.

Künast held the office of Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection until 2005, over time becoming known for increasing consumer protection, supporting organic farming, and expanding animal welfare. During her time in office, she ranked behind only Schröder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in public opinion polls.

===Member of the German Parliament, 2002–2025===
Following the 2002 elections, Künast was part of the Green Party&#x27;s team in the negotiations with the Social Democrats on a coalition agreement for the second government under the leadership of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. 

After the 2005 federal election, Künast became co-chair of the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary group, initially together with Fritz Kuhn and later with Jürgen Trittin. In the 2005 vote, she won against Trittin and Katrin Göring-Eckardt. Also since 2005, she has been serving on the Committee on the Election of Judges (&quot;Wahlausschuss&quot;), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany.

Künast announced on 5 November 2010 that she we would be the candidate for Governing Mayor of Berlin for Alliance 90/The Greens in the 2011 Berlin state election. At the time of the announcement, her party was eight percentage points ahead of the Social Democrats in the opinion polls. Under her leadership, the Green Party came third with 17.6 percent of the vote, ten percentage points behind the Social Democrates but still up from the 13.1 percent they won in the previous election. However, incumbent Klaus Wowereit from the Social Democrats chose to enter a coalition with the conservative CDU, leaving Künast without any role in Berlin state politics.

Ahead of the 2013 elections, Künast announced her candidacy to lead the Green Party’s campaign. In an internal vote, she ultimately lost against Katrin Göring-Eckardt and Jürgen Trittin. 

After the 2013 elections, the resignation of Künast and Trittin as co-leaders of the Green Party&#x27;s group in parliament cleared the way for the election of Göring-Eckardt and Anton Hofreiter. Instead, Künast unsuccessfully ran against Claudia Roth for the office of Vice President of the German Bundestag. She eventually served as chairwoman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Consumer Protection from 2014 until 2017. Since 2018, she has been a member of the Committee on Food and Agriculture. 

In the negotiations to form a so-called traffic light coalition of the Social Democrats (SPD), the Green Party and the FDP following the 2021 federal elections, Künast led her party&#x27;s delegation in the working group on agriculture and nutrition; her co-chairs from the other parties are Till Backhaus and Carina Konrad.

In July 2024, Künast announced that she would not stand in the 2025 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.

==Political positions==

===Human rights===
In 2010, Künast criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel for speaking at an award ceremony for Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard in Potsdam, arguing that while it was true that the right to freedom of expression also applies to Westergaard&#x27;s controversial Muhammad cartoons &quot;if a chancellor also makes a speech on top of that, it serves to heat up the debate.&quot;

In August 2012, Künast was one of 124 members of the Bundestag to sign a letter that was sent to the Russian ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin, expressing concern over the trial against the three members of Pussy Riot. &quot;Being held in detention for months and the threat of lengthy punishment are draconian and disproportionate&quot;, the lawmakers said in the letter. &quot;In a secular and pluralist state, peaceful artistic acts -- even if they can be seen as provocative -- must not lead to the accusation of serious criminal acts that lead to lengthy prison terms.&quot;

In 2015, Künast was the initiator of a bill in favor of legalizing assisted suicide, arguing that &quot;a punishment of commercial euthanasia would expose doctors to the severe risk of legal investigations.&quot; However, the Bundestag later voted to criminalize organizations that assist patients seeking to terminate their lives in return for payment and makes assisting a suicide punishable by up to three years in prison.

===Regulation of digital platforms===
In 2021, Künast requested the personal data of several Facebook users to pursue the authors of 22 insulting comments against her, many of which were of a sexist or violent nature. In 2022, the Federal Constitutional Court sided with Künast personal data.

===Economic policy===
Amid the financial crisis of 2007–08, Künast proposed to solve the state-owned banks&#x27; financial woes and to merge the Germany&#x27;s then eight regional banks into one institution, which would concentrate on regional economic development. In a 2008 interview with newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;: &quot;The regional banks should be merged into one and their functions need to be clearly laid out.&quot; Ahead of the 2009 federal elections, in an attempt to come up with an antidote to the other political parties&#x27; hijacking of green ideas, Künast and her fellow lead candidate Jürgen Trittin backed up their critique of incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s government with a &quot;Green New Deal&quot;, calling for €20 billion ($27.4 billion) a year to be invested in climate protection, environmental technology and education.

===Consumer protection===
In 2010, Künast called for a ban on advertising for sweets aimed at children.

===Relations with the CDU===
Over the course of her career, Künast has regularly dismissed prospects for an alternative coalition between the Greens and Angela Merkel&#x27;s Christian Democratic Union on a national level.

==Recognition==
In 2010, Künast – along with Cécile Duflot, Monica Frassoni, and Marina Silva – was named by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine to its list of top global thinkers, for taking Green mainstream.

== Personal life ==
Künast has been married to lawyer Rüdiger Portius since 2011. From 2001, she shared an apartment with Katrin Göring-Eckardt in Berlin’s Friedenau district. 

==Controversy==
===Hate speech===
Künast was personally extremely insulted by hate speech on the net; mostly on Facebook she got sexually insulted. Künast fights more consistently than almost any other German politician against these form of violent by anonymous persons. 

The Berlin Regional Court initially found that these were all permissible expressions of opinion, Künast had provoked these comments because of a misleading statement in 1986 about sex with children. Künast lodged an appeal. As a result, the district court obliged Facebook to provide information about the authors of some comments, so that the politician could take legal action against these people. 

All this has been annulled by the Federal Constitutional Court (BVG) in February 2022. The Berlin courts had not weighed properly. The Berlin court had always evaluated all comments in the context of the discussion, BVG said. But even with a reference to a public debate, not everything is allowed.

===Antisemitism===
In July 2009 Künast was accused of antisemitism by the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, after she had allegedly been overheard calling the pro-Israel &quot;Stop The Bomb&quot; organisation a &quot;Mossad front&quot;, which she denied.

===Domestic security===
In October 2015 Künast advised the police officer Tania Kambouri during a talk show that the police should take their shoes off before raids in mosques. Kambouri had published a book about her experience with the rising violence by Muslim men against law enforcement and especially against women.

In July 2016 Künast posted a Tweet in which she questioned the shooting of an Afghan refugee and ISIS sympathiser who severely injured five people with an axe. She was criticized for publicly accusing the police of wrongdoing without knowing the details and before the official investigation was started. Members from her party distanced themselves from the statement and said that they trusted the German police. Police union chief Rainier Wendt called her a &quot;parliamentary smart aleck&quot;.

<text>Joseph Martin &quot;Joschka&quot; Fischer (born 12 April 1948) is a German former politician of the Alliance 90/The Greens party. He served as the foreign minister and as the vice chancellor of Germany in the cabinet of Gerhard Schröder from 1998 to 2005. Fischer has been a leading figure in the German Greens since the 1970s, and according to opinion polls, he was the most popular politician in Germany for most of the Schröder government&#x27;s duration. Following the September 2005 election, in which the Schröder government was defeated, he left office on 22 November 2005. In September 2010, he supported the creation of the Spinelli Group, a Europarliamentarian initiative founded with a view to reinvigorate efforts to federalise the European Union.

==Early life==
Fischer was born in Gerabronn in Württemberg-Baden, the third child of a butcher, whose family had lived in Budakeszi, Hungary, for several generations. Fischer&#x27;s family had to leave Hungary in 1946 after it was occupied by the Soviet Union, and ethnic Germans were persecuted and expelled by the authorities. His nickname &quot;Joschka&quot; is derived from the Hungarian &quot;Jóska&quot;, diminutive of Joseph (Hungarian &quot;József&quot;). He was brought up Catholic and served in his childhood as an altar boy in his parish in Oeffingen. Fischer dropped out of high school in 1965, and started an apprenticeship as a photographer, which he quit in 1966. Because Fischer never gained a school-leaving certificate, he never attended a university or a college. He neither did compulsory military service nor the alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors, because he failed his physical examination due to poor eyesight.

In 1967, he became active in the German student movement and left-wing movement (post-) 1968 (the so-called &quot;Spontis&quot;), first in Stuttgart and after 1968 in Frankfurt am Main. For his regular income, Fischer took several low-wage jobs, such as working in a left-wing bookstore in Frankfurt. During this period, he began attending university events, including lectures organized by left-wing revolutionary students by Theodor W. Adorno, Jürgen Habermas and Oskar Negt. He studied the works of Marx, Mao and Hegel and became a member of the militant group, &quot;Revolutionärer Kampf&quot; (Revolutionary Struggle). Fischer was a leader in several street battles involving the radical &quot;Putzgruppe&quot; (literally &quot;cleaning squad&quot;, with the first syllable being an acronym for &quot;Proletarische Union für Terror und Zerstörung&quot;, &quot;Proletarian Union for Terror and Destruction&quot;), which attacked a number of police officers. Photos of one such brawl in March 1973, which were later to haunt Fischer, show him clubbing policeman Rainer Marx, to whom he later publicly apologized.

Fischer is a close friend of Daniel Cohn-Bendit, whom he met during that time. In 1969, Fischer was photographed in Algeria at a meeting of the PLO, which remained a terrorist organization until 1988. In 1971, he began working for the car manufacturer Opel and attempted to organise his fellow workers for the coming communist revolution. (This was not organising on behalf of a regular labour union: the vast majority of Opel&#x27;s workers had already been organised for decades by IG Metall, the German metalworkers&#x27; union.) This resulted in his dismissal from the company after six months. Fischer then continued making a living with unskilled work while continuing his activism. He worked as a taxi driver from 1976 to 1981 and later in a bookstore in Frankfurt.

In the &quot;Deutscher Herbst&quot; (German autumn) of 1977, Germany was rattled by a series of left-wing terrorist attacks by the Red Army Faction (RAF) and Revolutionary Cells (RZ). According to Fischer&#x27;s own account, witnessing these events, particularly the kidnapping and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the Entebbe hijacking, made him renounce violence as a means for political change. Instead, he became involved in the new social movements and later in the newly founded Green Party, mainly in the state of Hesse.

In May 1981, the Hessian Secretary of Commerce Heinz-Herbert Karry was murdered with a firearm that in 1973 had been transported in Fischer&#x27;s car, along with other weapons stolen from an American army base. Fischer maintained he had given the car to the later terrorist Hans-Joachim Klein solely for the purpose of having Klein fit it with a new engine. Only later had Fischer learned that his car had been used to transport stolen weapons.

As Foreign Minister, Fischer apologised for the violence of his &quot;Putzgruppe&quot; days, without disassociating himself from the radical movement. Some critics continue to charge that Fischer was the leading figure of a 1976 discussion that led to the use of Molotov cocktails in an upcoming demonstration in support of RAF member Ulrike Meinhof. Fischer was arrested on 14 May 1976 as a suspect in the Molotov cocktail attacks on police, but was released after two days. Fischer stated that he never used Molotov cocktails against the police. The firebombing of policeman Jürgen Weber&#x27;s police car left Weber with burns over 60% of his body.

==Green politician==
From 1983 to 1985, Fischer was a member of the Bundestag for the Green party. His stint in federal parliament saw him frequently engage in a frank and confrontational debating style, exemplified by an incident on 18 October 1984, when he addressed Richard Stücklen, then vice president of the parliament, with the words: &quot;If I may say so, Mr. President, you are an asshole&quot; (German: &quot;Mit Verlaub, Herr Präsident, Sie sind ein Arschloch.&quot;). In 1985, Fischer became Minister for the Environment in the Landtag of Hesse in the first governmental Red-Green coalition between the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Greens. Fischer caused a stir when he appeared at his oath of office ceremony wearing trainers. These trainers are now part of the shoe collection at the German Leather and Shoe Museum in Offenbach, Hesse.

Fischer also expressed his thoughts very frankly in the periodical of the Hessian Green party &quot;Stichwort Grün&quot;. In the edition of October 1989—one month before the fall of the Berlin Wall—he penned an article with the heading: &quot;Der Wiedervereinigung die Schnauze verbieten!&quot; (Shutting up the re-unification!)

Fischer was again environment minister in Hessen from 1991 to 1994 and then became co-chairman of the Greens&#x27; parliamentary faction in the Bundestag. Fischer was respected for his oratory skills, as well as for his charisma on the political stage. For a large part of the 1990s, with the social democrats languishing in the opinion polls, Fischer&#x27;s admirers referred to him as the &quot;real&quot; leader of the opposition. He parlayed his clout into political success, as he moved the Greens to the centre ground of German politics, paving the way for their first participation in the nation&#x27;s federal government.

==Foreign minister==
In September 1998, the Social Democratic Party of Germany, led by Gerhard Schröder, defeated the Christian Democratic Union government of Helmut Kohl. The SPD&#x27;s 41% and the Greens&#x27; 7% of the vote set the two parties on a possible path to government through a coalition. Schröder stated his preference for a red-green coalition, as did an overwhelming majority of SPD members. After several weeks of negotiations, a SPD-Green government took power on 27 October 1998, with Fischer appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. By 2005, he was the second longest-serving foreign minister in German postwar history (after Hans-Dietrich Genscher).

In mid-April 1999, Germany came up with the first peace plan for the war in Kosovo, when Fischer produced a proposal, notably including Russia, that would have rewarded the beginning of a Yugoslav pullout from Kosovo with a bombing pause. In May 1999, however, an antiwar protester flung a bag of red paint at Fischer during a party convention debating NATO&#x27;s airstrikes on Yugoslavia in the war over Kosovo; Fischer suffered a perforated eardrum.

In an effort to make it easier for antiwar critics to back Schröder&#x27;s decision to send German Bundeswehr troops to Afghanistan in 2001, Fischer and Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul announced a 256 million marks ($115 million) humanitarian-aid package for Afghan refugees. In late 2001, Fischer hosted – under the auspices of the United Nations – a ten-day conference at the German government guesthouse above the Rhine River, where delegates from four Afghan factions signed the Bonn Agreement establishing a transitional government for the country to replace the deposed Taliban regime. At the time, Germany&#x27;s longstanding links to Afghanistan and its 2001 chairmanship of the Afghanistan Support Group (consisting of countries pledging humanitarian and reconstruction aid for Afghanistan) were the reasons it was picked to host the meeting.

In September 2001, Fischer summoned Ahmad Azizi, the Iranian ambassador to Germany, for urgent talks after several reformist intellectuals – including Akbar Ganji, Mehrangiz Kar and Ezzatollah Sahabi – were given prison sentences of between four and 10 years for participating in a 2000 academic and cultural conference sponsored by the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Berlin in late 2000.

In 2005, critics charged that Fischer&#x27;s relaxing of controls on visa regulations for Ukraine, would allow illegal immigrants to enter Germany with fake identities. A parliamentary committee was established to examine the case, and unlike in other such committee hearings, Fischer&#x27;s statement (and that of other top officials) was shown live on public television. Fischer&#x27;s appearance before the committee lasted twelve hours. (See German Visa Affair 2005).

Fischer represented the German government at the funeral services for Foreign Minister Anna Lindh of Sweden on 19 September 2003 in Stockholm; Pope John Paul II on 8 April 2005 in Rome; and former UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on 12 August 2005 in Edinburgh.

After the defeat of the coalition government in the 2005 election, Fischer announced that he would retire to the backbench. &quot;After 20 years of power, now I want my freedom back&quot;, Fischer said. On 13 October 2005, it was announced that Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the SPD would succeed Fischer as foreign minister.

===Western Balkans policy===
In 1999, Fischer supported German military participation in the Kosovo War. This proved to be a highly controversial position since Fischer&#x27;s plan not only clashed with the largely pacifist philosophy of The Greens, but because it also supported for the first time since World War II active participation of German soldiers in combat. Fischer justified this military involvement with allegations that Serbia was planning to commit genocide against the Kosovo Albanians.

Fischer represented the German government at the funeral services for Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić of Serbia on 16 March 2003 (alongside Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul) and President Boris Trajkovski of Macedonia on 5 March 2004 in Skopje.

===Transatlantic relations===

On fundamental issues like the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, and the crisis in the Middle East, Fischer was openly differing with the Bush administration.

In 1999, both Fischer and Justice Minister Herta Däubler-Gmelin appealed for clemency for the LaGrand brothers, two German citizens sentenced to death in Arizona. According to the German government, the LaGrands had been denied their rights as German citizens because prosecutors did not inform the German consulate of the brothers&#x27; arrest in 1982 until a decade later. However, both were put to death, one in a cloud of cyanide gas. In response, the European Union submitted an anti-death-penalty resolution to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.

Although Fischer was in favour of stationing German troops in Afghanistan, he advised chancellor Schröder not to join the war in Iraq. Fischer famously confronted United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at the 39th Munich Security Conference in 2003 on the secretary&#x27;s purported evidence for Iraq&#x27;s possession of weapons of mass destruction (&quot;Excuse me, I am not convinced&quot;).

===Middle East policy===
Fischer has been criticized for attending a 1969 conference of the Palestine Liberation Organization, where Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called for an all-out war on Israel &quot;until the end&quot;.

During their time in government, both Fischer and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder were widely considered sincerely, if not uncritically, pro-Israeli. In 1999, Fischer led a delegation including European Commissioner Manuel Marín and the European Union&#x27;s Special Envoy to the Middle East Miguel Ángel Moratinos on a visit to Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories, but also to a range of other countries which have a crucial role in the peace process, including Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt. By 2001, he emerged as a pivotal figure in the hopes for the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, in part because he helped bring about a lull in the violence after the Dolphinarium discotheque massacre in June 2001. His intervention led to an announced cease-fire arranged by George Tenet, the United States Director of Central Intelligence; Fischer had been in Tel Aviv at the time of the blast. Fischer later brokered a meeting between Arafat and the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to discuss how to implement the cease-fire.

In July 2002, Fischer presented a proposal that called for Arafat to appoint an interim prime minister. After the vote, the proposal said, elected officials could continue democratic reforms leading to a provisional Palestinian state by the end of 2003 and to final borders by 2005. He represented the German government at the funeral services for Arafat on 12 November 2004 in Cairo and at the inauguration of the new Holocaust Memorial Museum at Yad Vashem in March 2005.

===European integration===
In May 2000, Fischer proposed the creation of a European federation with a directly elected president and parliament sharing real executive and legislative powers. Fischer proposed the eventual enactment of a constitutional treaty that would set out which powers were to be shifted to the new European executive and parliament, and those that remained at national level. In response, President Jacques Chirac of France urged Germany in June 2000 to join France in spearheading a core group of European Union countries that would move faster than others toward political and economic union.

In October 2002, Fischer was appointed by the German government to the Convention on the Future of Europe, replacing Peter Glotz. Fischer had expressed a keen interest in taking part in the convention during the coalition talks with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder following the 2002 elections. In a paper jointly signed by Fischer and French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, in November 2002, Germany and France pushed for a mutual defence commitment to be part of the constitution. In 2004, he was one of the signatories to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.

====Relations with Russia====
Fischer has long been critical of Russia, especially on human rights. However, during his time as foreign minister, Germany&#x27;s relations with Russia were primarily guided by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. In 2004, Fischer called on Ukraine to hold a recount of the presidential elections after Putin-backed candidate Viktor Yanukovich was the first to declare his victory despite mass protests in Kyiv.

==Life after politics==
=== Non-profit work ===
From September 2006 until 2007, Fischer was a senior fellow at the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination, and as a visiting professor co-taught with Wolfgang F. Danspeckgruber at Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, both at Princeton University. He has also spoken at other American universities on various topics in foreign affairs and international relations.

In addition, Fischer joined various non-governmental organizations, including:
* Arab Democracy Foundation, Founding Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2007)
* Council on Foreign Relations, Member
* European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), Founding Co-chairman of the Board (alongside Martti Ahtisaari and Mabel van Oranje)
* United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN), Member of the Presidium
* Institute for Human Sciences (IWM), Member of the Board of Patrons
* Roland Berger Human Dignity Award, Member of the Awards Committee

On 15 September 2010 Fischer supported the new initiative Spinelli Group, which was founded to reinvigorate efforts towards federalisation of the European Union (EU). Other prominent supporters are: Jacques Delors, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Andrew Duff, Elmar Brok.

=== Business activities ===
Since 2008, Fischer has been Senior Strategic Counsel at Albright Stonebridge Group, Washington, DC, consulting firm led by Madeleine Albright. In this capacity, he advised Siemens, BMW and Deutsche Börse.

In 2009, Fischer took a post as adviser to the Nabucco pipeline project, which involved the German RWE company. According to media reports, the &quot;six-digit salary&quot; consultancy contract had already been signed.

Other for-profit activities include:
* Meridiam, Member of the supervisory board (since 2012)
* Tilray, Member of the Advisory Board

==Personal life==
Prior to the German Visa Affair 2005, Fischer was a popular politician, &quot;loved by an entire nation.&quot; Writing in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, journalist Charles Hawley opined that since 1998, &quot;Joschka Fischer&#x27;s popularity has been virtually unassailable: The icon of the environmentally minded Green Party could, it seemed, do no wrong. Indeed, Fischer was so popular in 2002 that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder largely based his early election campaign on the fact that Fischer would remain at his side at the helm of Germany&#x27;s political leadership.&quot; As Germany&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Fischer&#x27;s popularity soared when he opposed the Iraq War, and his very public struggle with his weight endeared him to many Germans.
Up until 1996, Fischer was a bon vivant, and often spoke openly about his love for good wines and food despite his &quot;chunky&quot; figure. As he ascended to the Foreign Ministry, Fischer decided to lose weight, transforming his body almost overnight by refraining from alcohol and becoming a vegetarian. In 2000, he covered the topic of his weight loss by writing the book &quot;My Long Race Towards Myself&quot; on his experience, which became an immediate bestseller in Germany.
Half a year before becoming foreign minister, he had his marathon debut at the 1998 Hamburg Marathon (clocking 3:41). As minister, he finished New York in 1999 (3:55) and Berlin in 2000 (3:55).
Afterwards, he reduced training and during the months preceding the Iraq War, Fischer began putting on weight again.

Fischer was married to German-Iranian film producer and screenwriter Minu Barati in 2005. It is his fifth marriage. His two children with his previous partner and eventual wife, Inge Vogel (to whom he was married from 1984 to 1987), were born in 1979 and 1983, respectively. At the time of his wedding with Barati in 2005, she was mother to a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, while Fischer&#x27;s children were 23 and 26 of age at the time. The couple lives with Barati&#x27;s daughter.

In 2004, he commissioned German heraldist Dieter Krieger to produce a coat of arms, which was registered to the Rhein-Main Wappenrolle. The arms are a type of a &quot;Canting arms&quot;; party per fesse silver and gules, in chief crossed axes with red blades and black handles, in base, a fish in the first. Crest of the red eagle&#x27;s wings, mantling red doubled silver.

He describes himself as Catholic, but not very religious.

<text>The molars or molar teeth are large, flat teeth at the back of the mouth. They are more developed in mammals. They are used primarily to grind food during chewing. The name &quot;molar&quot; derives from Latin, &quot;molaris dens&quot;, meaning &quot;millstone tooth&quot;, from &quot;mola&quot;, millstone and &quot;dens&quot;, tooth. Molars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across the mammal groups. The third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.

==Human anatomy==

In humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. Adult humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. The third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. It is the last tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20, although this varies among individuals and populations, and in many cases the tooth is missing.

The human mouth contains upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) molars. They are: maxillary first molar, maxillary second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second molar, and mandibular third molar.

==Mammal evolution==
In mammals, the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex shapes. The basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections called cusps and the valleys that separate them. The cusps contain both dentine and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are the result of different enamel thickness. Cusps are occasionally joined to form ridges and expanded to form crests. Cingula are often incomplete ridges that pass around the base of the crown.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make determining how this happened impossible. According to the widely accepted &quot;differentiation theory&quot;, additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth from the crown, while the rivalling &quot;concrescence theory&quot; instead proposes that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth. Therian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps arranged in a triangle.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Morphology==
Each major cusp on an upper molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. Suffixes are added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid); -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). A shelf-like ridge left lower part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular cuspule or conulid.

===Tribosphenic===

The design that is considered one of the most important characteristics of therian mammals is called a tribosphenic molar. Among living mammals, the tribosphenic tooth is found in most insectivorous mammals as well as young platypuses, even though adults platypuses are toothless.

In tribosphenic teeth, the lower molar is divided into two regions: the three-cusped trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. In modern tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid is towards the rear. The trigonid is defined by three large cusps: the protoconid is on the buccal/labial (cheek) side of the tooth, while the anterior paraconid and posterior metaconid are on the lingual (tongue) side.

Upper molars look like three-pointed mountain ranges, with their features mirrored from the lower molars. The protocone cusp is on the lingual side of the tooth, while the anterior paracone and posterior metacone are on the buccal side. The protocone of the upper molar and talonid basin of the lower molar mesh together as a crushing system similar to a mortar and pestle.

Tribosphenic molars were present in the direct ancestors of all three living mammal groups, but it was most likely not ancestral to mammals as a whole. Many paleontologists argue that it developed independently in monotremes (from australosphenidans), rather than being inherited from a common ancestor that they share with marsupials and placentals (from boreosphenidans); this idea still has some critics. For example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme &quot;Steropodon&quot; is similar to those of &quot;Peramus&quot; and dryolestoids, which suggests that monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic mammals, but, on the other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.

Some Jurassic mammalia forms, such as docodonts and shuotheriids, have &quot;reversed tribosphenic&quot; molars, in which a talonid-like structure develops towards the front of the lower molar, rather than towards the rear. This variant is regarded as an example of convergent evolution.

===Quadrate===

From the primitive tribosphenic tooth, molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. In many groups, a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below). Quadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars have a hypocone, an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side of the upper molar, located posterior to the protocone. Quadrate molars appeared early in mammal evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and many primates, including humans. There may be a fifth cusp.

In many mammals, additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. They are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.

===Bunodont===
In bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather than sharp peaks. They are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears, and humans. Bunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically quadrate in shape.

===Hypsodont===
Hypsodont dentition is characterized by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides extra material for wear and tear. Some examples of animals with hypsodont dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material. Hypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).

Hypsodont molars lack both a crown and a neck. The occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing and grinding plant material. The body is covered with cementum both above and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire length of the body. The cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick layer of dentin.

===Brachydont===
The opposite condition to hypsodont is called brachydont or brachyodont (from &quot;brachys&quot; &#x27;short&#x27;). It is a type of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. Human teeth are brachydont.

A brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it, and at least one root. A cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down to the neck. Cementum is only found below the gingival line. The occlusal surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.

===Zalambdodont===
Zalambdodont upper molars have at least three main cusps, one larger on the lingual side and two smaller on the labial side. The large cusp is joined to the other two by crests, forming a narrow V- or λ (lambda)-shape. The term &quot;zalambdodont&quot; roughly translates to &quot;very lambda-toothed&quot;. Zalambdodont molars are found in tenrecs, golden moles, solenodons, and marsupial moles among living mammals.

In zalambdodont placentals, the larger inner cusp is homologous with the paracone in a tribosphenic upper molar, while the metacone is absent, reduced or fused. Marsupial moles show the opposite condition, with the large cusp equivalent to the metacone, and the paracone absent instead. The protocone is either absent (as in some golden moles and tenrecs) or reduced to a small fourth cusp, positioned lingual to the large cusp at the tip of the V. The two labial cusps are located on an expanded shelf called the stylar shelf. In the lower molars, the talonid region is reduced or absent, having lost its role as a crushing basin against the protocone. Zalambdodonty reduces tooth contact to a few simple shearing surfaces, though the evolutionary advantage of this tooth type is unclear.

===Dilambdodont===
Like zalambdodont molars, dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas or a W. On the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. A protocone is present lingual to the ectoloph. Dilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles, and some insectivorous bats.

===Lophodont===
Lophodont teeth are easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. Present in most herbivores, these patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates, such as equids.

Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. Lophodont molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. Examples include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.

When two lophs form transverse, often ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. This pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits, and pikas) and some rodents.

Extreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and some rodents (such as &quot;Otomys&quot;) is known as loxodonty. The African elephant belongs to a genus called &quot;Loxodonta&quot; because of this feature.

===Selenodont===
In selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. Examples include most even-toed ungulates, such as cattle and deer.

===Secodont===

Many carnivorous mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and chopping called carnassials. A general term for such blade-like teeth is secodont or plagiaulacoid.
