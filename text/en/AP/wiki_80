<text>Scouting in Mississippi has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910-1950)==
In 1909, Dr. Cran, the Local Episcopal Minister, and Mr. C.H. Hamilton organized Troop 19 in Brookhaven, Mississippi. In 1910, the unit was officially recognized by the local scout office in Vicksburg. Troop 19 became Troop 119 after the Andrew Jackson Council was formed. It was sponsored by the First Presbyterian Church until 1938/39 when it was then sponsored by &quot;The Men&#x27;s Bible Class&quot; First United Methodist church where it has remained. The Troop has been continuously chartered since 1910 and is as old as the incorporated Boy Scouts of America.

In 1912, one year after the Boy Scout movement came from England to the United States, George F. Maynard, Sr. founded the first troop in Tupelo — Troop 1. Scout units were soon founded in other cities such as Picayune, Corinth and Oxford.

The Yazoo County Council was founded in 1919, and closed in 1922. The Southwest Mississippi Council (#303) was founded in 1923, and closed in 1928. The South Mississippi Area Council (#705) was founded in 1925, and closed in 1928. The Meridian Council (#302) was founded in 1920, and in 1935 changed its name to the Choctaw Area Council (#302).

The Pine Burr-Hattiesburg Area Council (#304) was founded in 1927, changing its name to the Pine Burr Area Council (#304) in 1935. The East Mississippi Area Council (#691) was founded in 1926, changing its name to the Pushmataha Area Council (#691) in 1936. The Yocona Area Council (#748) was founded in 1926.

The Jackson Council (#301) was founded in 1918, changing its name to the Hinds and Rankin Counties Council (#301) in 1922. The Vicksburg Council (#304) was founded in 1919. The Hinds and Rankin Counties and Vicksburg councils merged to become the Kickapoo Area Council (#301) in 1927. In 1930, the Andrew Jackson Area Council (#303) was merged, and it merged with the Kickapoo Area Council (#301) in 1937 to become the Andrew Jackson Council (#303).

==Recent history (1950-1990)==

<text>A comedy club is a venue where a variety of comedic acts perform to a live audience. Although the term usually refers to establishments that feature stand-up comedians, it can also feature other forms of comedy such as improvisational comedians, impersonators, impressionists, magicians and ventriloquists.

Some forms of comedy can have distinguished venues such as improvisational theatres, which host improv or sketch comedy, and variety clubs which may also host musical acts along with comedic acts.

== History ==

=== Morocco ===

The documentation of Moroccan comedy spaces traces its roots back to the 17th Century, encompassing rich performance practices like &quot;Labsat&quot; and &quot;Sultan Talba&quot;. The origins of comedy clubs can be traced to &quot;Labsat&quot;, an extravagant performance arts festival, with the noteworthy milestone of the first show staged within the king&#x27;s, Sultan Mohammed ibn Abd Allah, palace. The evolution continued with &quot;Sultan Tabla&quot;, a theatrical celebration that served as a precursor to more modern &quot;al-halqa&quot;. &quot;Al-halqa&quot;, characterized by storytelling circles infused with elements of humor, played a pivotal role in shaping comedy performance spaces and practices.

The period of French colonization from 1912 to 1956 marked a significant chapter in the history of comedy clubs in Morocco, having heavy influences on artistic practices. Following the decline of French colonial dominance, comic theaters emerged as distinct spaces, gaining prominence in the 80s as a response to the heightened cultural interest in addressing humorous real-life concerns. The theatrical landscape saw a flourishing of comic theater, employing humor and cultural critique to entertain audiences while fostering a connection with real-life experiences.

The spaces theaters and comedy clubs provided created cultural space for a future of comedy in Morocco. Now, Moroccan comedy clubs function as important spaces for humour and cultural commentary.

=== Japan ===
The emergence of Japanese comedy clubs can be traced back to the 18th century with the establishment of Yose theatres. These early iterations were constructed for various forms of entertainment, such as Kōdan, Rōkyoku, Rakugo, and other varieties.

Over the years, a notable convergence occurred between Yose and Rakugo, with the two becoming increasingly intertwined. In contemporary times, the majority of Yose theatres exclusively feature Rakugo performances, underscoring the prevalent association between Yose theatres and this particular form of comedic storytelling.

Rakugo is a traditional Japanese storytelling art where a hanashika enacts stories by embodying characters through distinct voices, gestures, and wordplay. The narratives typically conclude with a punch line, referred to as &quot;ochi,&quot; akin to the structure observed in contemporary stand-up comedy, which often utilizes punchlines and wordplay for comedic effect. In this way, Yose were the first comedy clubs hosting stand-up comedians (hanashikas) through the art of Rakugo.

The first Yose theatre was organized in 1798 by Karaku Sanshotei 1st at the Shitaya-jinja Shrine in Shitaya, Tokyo. The stone monument commemorating the birthplace of Yose is located in this shrine, initially referred to as yoseba before later adopting the term &quot;yose.&quot; Towards the end of the Edo period, multiple Yose theatres emerged, providing a primary source of entertainment in towns where options were limited.

The subsequent Meiji and Taisho eras witnessed the appearance of large-scale Yose theatres. However, with the advent of various entertainments like television, the number of visitors to Yose establishments significantly declined, leading to closures. In recent years, the dwindling interest in performance arts within Yose has resulted in the survival of only a few Yose theatres. Consequently, the overall Yose industry faces challenging business conditions as it contends with changing entertainment preferences.

=== Contemporary American-style clubs ===
Since the late 1960s and 70s, hundreds of comedy clubs have adopted a similar formula.

The first of these pioneers were The Improv and Dangerfield&#x27;s.

The Improv opened as a coffee house in 1963, within the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City. While it hosted its first comedian in 1964, 5 years before Dangerfield&#x27;s opening in 1969, it only shifted into a comedy club after hours. The Improv became exclusively a comedy club over the years, before its closing in 1992.

Dangerfield&#x27;s was built ground-up as a comedy club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It closed due to the pandemic in 2020.

== Design ==
Comedy clubs advantageously use their space to cater to their audience and create an optimal experience. Most clubs adjust their lighting to darker tones with the aim of creating anonymity in the crowd. Anonymity has the effect of producing more genuine responses in individuals, while also decreasing amount of external stress produced by being seen. The darkness factor is a key element to get the crowd feeling more relaxed in their space, especially for more controversial jokes which most comedians often make use of.

Comedy clubs use low ceilings and small interior spaces to create fuller looking crowds. Low ceilings are especially important for most comedy clubs since laughter is an important part of their ambience. Laughter is proven to be contagious in humans, and low ceilings allow for the sound of laughter to bounce back from the ceilings and be heard throughout the space. In higher ceilings and bigger spaces the sound of people’s laughter vanishes almost instantly. Lower ceilings contribute to a more joyful space. The bare redbrick wall of The Improv in New York, a result of the venue not having the budget to cover it with drywall, would go on to become a common design feature of comedy clubs.

Comedy clubs opt for colder temperatures for multiple reasons. A main reason for colder temperature is that the comedian does not get too flushed and tired under the hot spotlights and cold room. The second and more influential effect is on the psychology of the audience; audiences become more alert and evidently more focused on the performance which usually elicits more laughter as a result.

Where a venue has multiple stages, an &quot;A Room&quot; is typically the largest and best room, used for popular acts, while a &quot;B Room&quot; is for local, lesser-known performers.

Comedy clubs often serve as the venue for stand-up comedy specials, where comedians are filmed at comedy clubs and theaters as they perform. These humorous spaces are also featured heavily in the show Seinfeld, where a staged comedy club serves as a vital place where the lead character, Jerry Seinfeld, performs and socializes.

<doc id="103076" wikidata="Q852" url="?curid=103076" title="Lockheed L-1011 TriStar">
<text>The Lockheed L-1011 TriStar (pronounced &quot;El-ten-eleven&quot;) is an American medium-to-long-range, wide-body trijet airliner built by the Lockheed Corporation. It was the third wide-body airliner to enter commercial operations, after the Boeing 747 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. The airliner has a seating capacity of up to 400 passengers and a range of over . Its trijet configuration has three Rolls-Royce RB211 engines with one engine under each wing, along with a third engine center-mounted with an S-duct air inlet embedded in the tail and the upper fuselage. The aircraft has an autoland capability, an automated descent control system, and available lower deck galley and lounge facilities.

The L-1011 TriStar was produced in two fuselage lengths. The original L-1011-1 first flew in November 1970 and entered service with Eastern Air Lines in 1972. The shortened, longer range L-1011-500 first flew in 1978 and entered service with British Airways a year later. The original-length TriStar was also produced as the high gross weight L-1011-100, the up-rated engine L-1011-200, and the further upgraded L-1011-250. Post-production conversions for the L-1011-1 with increased takeoff weights included the L-1011-50 and L-1011-150. 

The L-1011 TriStar&#x27;s sales were hampered by two years of delays due to developmental and financial problems at Rolls-Royce, the sole manufacturer of the aircraft&#x27;s engines. Between 1968 and 1984, Lockheed manufactured a total of 250 TriStars, assembled at the Lockheed plant located at the Palmdale Regional Airport in southern California north of Los Angeles. After L-1011 production ended, Lockheed withdrew from the commercial aircraft business due to its below-target sales. As of 2025, only one L-1011 is in service, as Stargazer.

==Development==

===Origins===
In the 1960s, American Airlines approached Lockheed and competitor Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas) with the need for an airliner that could carry 250 passengers on transcontinental routes. Lockheed had not produced civilian airliners since 1961 with the L-188 Electra. In the 1950s the Electra was designed for turboprop propulsion, which Lockheed successfully used on the C-130 Hercules military transport. Even after the Electra overcame vibration problems that caused several crashes early in its career, the market for large airliners would soon shift over to jet airliners such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. Lockheed won contracts for jet military transports with the C-141 StarLifter, and pioneered very large jet transports with the large C-5 Galaxy with its high-bypass turbofan engines. Boeing lost the military contract, but its private-venture 747 would later capture a much larger civilian airliner market for wide-body airliners.

Having experienced difficulties with some of its military programs, Lockheed was eager to re-enter the civilian market with a smaller wide-body jet, and its response was the L-1011 TriStar. Douglas Aircraft answered American Airlines with the DC-10, which had a similar three-engine configuration and dimensions. Despite their similarities, the L-1011 and DC-10&#x27;s engineering approach differed greatly. McDonnell, who had recently taken over Douglas Aircraft, directed DC-10 development on a &quot;very firm budget, and cost overruns were unacceptable even at the expense of safety&quot;, and the conservative approach meant reusing Douglas DC-8 technology. By contrast, Lockheed would &quot;take the most advanced technology of the day and when that technology was lacking, Lockheed created it&quot; for the L-1011 to give it lower noise emissions, improved reliability, and higher efficiency over first-generation jet airliners. The TriStar name was selected in a Lockheed employee naming contest for the airliner. The advanced technology that went into the TriStar resulted in a high purchase price.
The TriStar&#x27;s design featured a twin-aisle interior with a maximum of 400 passengers and a three-engine layout. The TriStar was originally conceived as a &quot;jumbo twin&quot;, but a three-engine design was ultimately chosen to give the aircraft enough thrust to take off from existing runways. Also, before the establishment of Extended Operations standards by the FAA in the 1980s, commercial jets with only two engines were not allowed to fly more than 30 minutes away from an airport, making trans-oceanic flights impossible. The main visible difference between the TriStar and its similar trijet competitor, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, is the central tail engine configuration: the DC-10&#x27;s engine is mounted above the fuselage for simplicity of design and more economical construction, while the TriStar&#x27;s engine is mounted to the rear fuselage and fed through an S-duct (similar to the Boeing 727) for reduced drag and improved stability. Lockheed engineers were able to maintain straight-through engine performance by limiting the curve of the S-duct to less than a quarter of the radius of the engine intake diameter. The S-duct design also reduced the total empty aircraft weight. The research undertaken during the design of the L-1011 indicated that losses of using an S-duct were more than compensated for by the above savings. A further major difference between the L-1011 and the DC-10 was Lockheed&#x27;s selection of the Rolls-Royce RB211 as the only engine for the L-1011. As originally designed, the RB211 turbofan was an advanced three-spool design with a carbon fiber fan, which would have better efficiency and power-to-weight ratio than any competing engine like the General Electric CF6 that powered the DC-10. In theory, the triple spool would produce the same or more power as existing double spool engines while having a smaller cross section that would reduce drag.
American Airlines opted for the Douglas DC-10, although it showed considerable interest in the L-1011. American intended to convince Douglas to lower its price for the DC-10, which it did. Without the support of American, the TriStar was launched on orders from TWA and Eastern Air Lines.
Although the TriStar&#x27;s design schedule closely followed that of its competitor, McDonnell Douglas beat Lockheed to market by a year due to delays in powerplant development. In February 1971, after massive development costs associated with the RB211, Rolls-Royce went into receivership. This halted L-1011 final assembly and Lockheed investigated the possibility of a US engine supplier. However the engineering was finalized at that stage in the TriStar&#x27;s development and its S-duct, which was designed to fit the smaller cross-section of the triple spool RB-211 engine that would have reduced drag, was too small in diameter to accommodate an existing double spool engine. One option presented was potential outsource of RB-211 production to Canadian manufacturer Orenda Engines.

The British government agreed to approve a large state subsidy to restart Rolls-Royce operations on condition that the U.S. government guarantee the bank loans Lockheed needed to complete the L-1011 project. Despite some opposition, not least from the then Governor of California, Ronald Reagan, the U.S. government provided these guarantees. For the rest of the RB211 project, Rolls-Royce remained a government-owned company.

===Production===
The TriStar&#x27;s internal Lockheed model number is L-093. The TriStar was manufactured in Lockheed facilities in Burbank and Palmdale, California.

The prototype L1011 first flew on November 16, 1970. The L-1011 was certified on April 14, 1972, with the first airliner delivered to Eastern Air Lines on April 26, 1972. In 1972, its unit cost was US$20 million (~$ in ). To further publicize the new aircraft, an L-1011 was taken on a world tour during 1972 by famed Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier. In a demonstration by test pilots LeVier and Charles Hall, 115 crew members, employees, and reporters embarked on the TriStar for a 4-hour, 13-minute flight from Palmdale to Dulles Airport &quot;with the TriStar&#x27;s AFCS [Automatic Flight Control System] feature engaged from takeoff roll to landing&quot;, and Lockheed touted it as &quot;a groundbreaking moment: the first cross-country flight without the need for human hands on the controls&quot;.

Lockheed discovered fairly early on that the TriStar suffered from higher than estimated structural weight, engine weight, and specific fuel consumption. To rectify this problem and to meet performance guarantees, Lockheed developed a structural kit that allowed maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) to be increased on production aircraft from . However, the weight problems affected the weight and desirability of early production L-1011-1 aircraft, known as Group 1 (serial numbers 1002 through to 1012).

Group 1 aircraft have an Operating empty weight (OEW) of , about higher than later aircraft, while Group 2 aircraft (serial numbers 1013 through 1051) have an OEW of , some lower. These aircraft, in general, also have different center of gravity envelopes with the forward center of gravity limit on the early aircraft being more restrictive at higher gross weights. Groups 1 and 2 aircraft (serial numbers 1002 to 1051) are upgradeable only to -50 or -150 specifications, although the Group 1 aircraft (up to serial number 1012) still maintain their operating disadvantages. All L-1011-1 aircraft from serial number 1052 onwards are Group 3 aircraft and are fully upgradeable to all variants up to -250 specification.
Costs at Rolls-Royce were controlled and its efforts largely went into the original TriStar engines, which needed considerable modifications between the L-1011&#x27;s first flight and service entry. The competition, notably General Electric, was very quick to develop its CF6 engine with more thrust, which meant that a heavier &quot;intercontinental&quot; DC-10-30 could be more quickly brought to market. The flexibility afforded to potential customers by a long-range DC-10 put the L-1011 at a serious disadvantage. Rolls-Royce went on to develop the high-thrust RB211-524 for the L-1011-200 and -500, but this took many years.

The resultant delay in Lockheed and Rolls-Royce offering a high gross variant with a longer range, coupled with the TriStar&#x27;s delayed introduction, meant that only 250 TriStars were sold compared to over 400 DC-10s. Lockheed needed to sell 500 airliners to break even, but in 1981, the company announced production would end with the delivery of the 250th and last L-1011 on order in 1984.

The TriStar&#x27;s failure to achieve profitability caused Lockheed to withdraw from the civilian aircraft business. The TriStar&#x27;s rivalry with the DC-10 has been seen as a &quot;case study in what can happen when two manufacturers attempt to split a market that simply could not support both aircraft&quot;. Lockheed lacked the resources to follow up with several proposals based on the TriStar wing and airframe, including a wide-body twinjet and a stretched quad-jet (one of the quadjet proposals consisting of two underwing engines and two rear fuselage-mounted engines). McDonnell Douglas was also financially weakened and could only develop the MD-11, a refinement of the DC-10, instead of an all-new design to challenge the next generation of twinjets like the Boeing 777.

==Design==
=== Engines ===
The RB211 and its features, despite the delays in its development, provided the L-1011 with then-unmatched fuel economy and noise levels.

==== Reversers and nozzle ====
During development the RB211 engines on the L-1011 had &quot;thrust-spoilers&quot; – target-type hot-stream reverse buckets – alongside the cold-bypass reversers. Despite capturing 25% of the total engine thrust, aerodynamic interference with the flaps diminished the braking effect of the flaps, so the thrust-spoilers were removed; instead an 11-degree afterbody was installed, which improved the specific range by 1.5%. Further improvements led to a 15-degree afterbody, enabling the L-1011 &quot;to beat its predicted specific air range at 0.85 Mach by between 3.5 and 5.5 percent, the exact figure depending on cruise weight.&quot;

=== All-flying tail ===
Instead of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) found on most jetliners of its time, the L-1011 incorporated an all-flying tail – a stabilator. The aft portion had a geared (anti-servo) elevator that was linked to and moved with the stabilator, changing the stabilator&#x27;s camber and improving the overall control surface effectiveness. Lockheed&#x27;s main drive away from a THS was &quot;[eliminating] mis-trim and runaway trim problems that have contributed to a number of accidents in the past.&quot; The fact that the elevators are not moved directly led to the failure in recognizing the jamming (trailing edge up) of the left elevator aboard Delta Air Lines Flight 1080 in 1977.

=== Fuel system ===
The L-1011-1 has four wing tanks; each inboard tank feeds the respective wing engine, and the two outboard tanks feed the tail engine via a flow equalizer. The additional center tank of the long-range variants, which is two halves, is located between the wing halves. Each center tank half acts as additional capacity to its adjacent inboard wing tank; filling it by way of ejector pumps. When the center tank is filled, it is used to crossfeed all three engines in flight (by way of the ejector pumps and crossfeed valves) until the center tank is empty and the remaining tanks are equalized.

=== Landing gear ===
The nose landing gear had two attachment points forward and aft, allowing a short-enough tug to push or pull the plane from directly underneath, a feature to allow operations where there wasn&#x27;t enough forward space at some airports, which was more common at the time.

=== Electrical system and avionics ===

The L-1011 was the first jetliner to have an integrated drive generator (IDG).

The FMS on the L-1011, certified by the FAA in September 1977, offered many features that have since become common. The features were aimed at greatly reducing crew workload and improving fuel efficiency. Of those are a Mach/IAS cruise control, an automatic Rough Air Mode that detects turbulence and adjusts the engine power setting accordingly, and a descent mode that figures out the optimum location to start a descent by &quot;back computing&quot; from a preselected point, allowing &quot;on-altitude and on-speed&quot; arrival.

The L-1011 also featured a highly advanced autopilot system and was the first widebody to receive FAA certification for Cat-IIIc autolanding, which approved the TriStar for completely blind landings performed by the aircraft&#x27;s autopilot in zero-visibility weather. The L-1011 used an inertial navigation system to navigate; this included aligning the navigation system by entering current coordinates of longitude and latitude.

It also had a unique direct lift control (DLC) system, which allowed for smooth approaches when landing, without having to use significant pitch changes while on the approach path. DLC helps maintain the aircraft on the glideslope during final approach by automatically deploying spoiler panels on the wings. Thus, rather than maintaining the descent by adjusting pitch, DLC helps control the descent while maintaining a more consistent pitch angle, using four redundant hydraulic systems.

=== Other components and systems ===
The APU, which was the Pratt and Whitney ST6L, was capable of operating up to 30,000 feet; its two square-shaped inlet doors are situated on the bottom fuselage on the aircraft&#x27;s centerline towards the rear of the plane.

Compared to the typical three-system of its era, the L-1011 had four independent 3,000-psi hydraulic systems, A through D.

Part of the production process also used a unique autoclave system for bonding fuselage panels together; this made the L-1011 extremely resistant to corrosion.

==Operational history==

===Commercial===
TWA heralded the TriStar as one of the safest aircraft in the world in promotional literature in the 1980s when concern over the safety record of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, flown by rival airlines, was at its peak. The L-1011 has been involved in five fatal accidents, only one of which was due to a problem with the aircraft.

Delta Air Lines was the type&#x27;s largest customer. Delta retired its TriStars in 2001 to replace them with the Boeing 767-400ER. Cathay Pacific eventually became the largest non-U.S. operator of the type by acquiring many of the Eastern Air Lines examples when Eastern went bankrupt, operating as many as 21 aircraft. Cathay Pacific retired its L-1011s in October 1996 and replaced the type with the Airbus A330-300. TWA withdrew its last TriStar from service in 1997.

To secure the Japanese market, Lockheed secretly bribed several members of the Japanese government to subsidize All Nippon Airways&#x27; purchase of L-1011s; this caused a significant scandal when the bribes were uncovered. The discovered scale to what has become known as the Lockheed bribery scandal led to the arrest of Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, as well as several other officials. Within Lockheed, board chairman Daniel Haughton and vice chairman and president Carl Kotchian resigned their posts on February 13, 1976. Tanaka was eventually tried and found guilty of violating foreign exchange control laws but was not charged with bribery, a more serious criminal offense. Crucially for Lockheed, the fallout from the scandal included the loss of a contract worth over $1 billion.

The Soviet Union at that time lacked a widebody airliner. Development of its own Ilyushin Il-86 was delayed; consequently, in the mid-1970s, the Soviets started negotiations to buy 30 TriStars and license-produce up to 100 a year. The talks collapsed as US President Jimmy Carter made human rights an important consideration in US foreign policy. The TriStar was also listed by the Coordinating Committee as embodying advanced technology forbidden for sale to potential enemies, which presented a serious obstacle to the export deal.

The last three airlines to operate the L-1011 in &quot;scheduled&quot; service were Brussels Airlines (codeshare with Hewa Bora Airways), Thai Sky Airlines, and Lloyd Aereo Boliviano, with final flights in August 2007, February 2008, and May 2008, respectively. In later years the L-1011 has been used by smaller start-up carriers, particularly in Africa and Asia. These operators mainly do their business in the &quot;ad hoc&quot; charter and wet leasing businesses. ATA Airlines (formerly known as American Trans Air) fleet included over 19 TriStars, but operations dwindled to only three L-1011-500s before the company&#x27;s shutdown in April 2008.

===Military===
The TriStar has also been used as a military tanker and passenger/cargo aircraft. The British Royal Air Force had nine aircraft of four variants. The aircraft were six ex-British Airways and three Pan Am L-1011-500s. All of the aircraft served with No. 216 Squadron, and were based at RAF Brize Norton. The TriStar was replaced in RAF service by the Airbus A330 MRTT under the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft program. 216 Squadron was officially disbanded on March 20, 2014, and flew its last sorties with the TriStar on March 24, 2014.

===Other===
In the early 1990s, Orbital Sciences began to use a converted L-1011-100 named &quot;Stargazer&quot; to launch Pegasus rockets into orbit around Earth. This venture effectively rendered the small Scout rocket obsolete. This aircraft was also used in support of the X-34 and X-43 programs. NASA performed aerodynamic research on Orbital Sciences&#x27; L-1011 in 1995. In 2014, three L-1011s in the world were airworthy. As of 2019, &quot;Stargazer&quot; is the only active L-1011.

==Variants==
The earlier versions of the L-1011, such as the -1, -100, and -150 can be distinguished from the later models by the design of the middle engine nacelles. The earlier version nacelle has a round intake, whereas the later models have a small vertical fin between the bottom of the middle engine intake and the top of the fuselage.

The two L-1011 aircraft delivered to Pacific Southwest Airlines were configured with internal airstair doors that led into an entry hall in what was normally the forward lower baggage hold. This was to allow operations from airfields that did not have terminal buildings with jet bridges. These two aircraft were later in service with Aeroperú and Worldways Canada.

===L-1011-1===
The L-1011-1 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1) was the first production model of the L-1011, designed for short- and medium-range flights. This variant served as the basis for subsequent variants. This type was purchased by Air Canada, ANA, Cathay Pacific, Eastern, and other operators with regional trunk routes requiring a widebody aircraft. Pacific Southwest Airlines purchased two L-1011-1 models with lower deck seating. This variant was also one of the few widebodies to have the option for a full-height built-in airstair.

The L-1011-1 was first delivered to Eastern Air Lines on April 5, 1972. A total of 160 L-1011-1 TriStars were built before production ended in 1983, although the majority of these, 119 or 75% of the total, were completed during a four-year period from 1972 to 1975. Most sales of the L-1011-1 were to US operators, with just three airlines, Delta, Eastern, and TWA, taking delivery of 110 combined. A further two aircraft were placed with a fourth US airline, Pacific Southwest Airlines.

===L-1011-100===
The L-1011-100 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1-14) was the second production model of the L-1011 and first flew in 1975 and featured a new center fuel tank and higher gross weights that increased the aircraft&#x27;s range by nearly . Launch orders for the L-1011-100 were placed by Saudia and Cathay Pacific, for two each, in May 1974. Deliveries began in June 1975.

The variant was also purchased by several airlines with longer-range routes, such as TWA, Air Canada, and BEA (which merged with BOAC to form British Airways). The first two L-1011-100s (serial numbers 1110 and 1116) were delivered new to Saudia with the same fuel capacity as the L-1011-1 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1-14); these were later upgraded to L-1011-200 specification.

===L-1011-50===
The L-1011-50 was an upgraded version of the L-1011-1 with an increase in maximum takeoff weight from to either or . Fuel capacity was not increased. The -50 was available only as a conversion package for the L-1011-1 and was never built new.

===L-1011-150===
The L-1011-150 was a development of the L-1011-1 with its maximum takeoff weight increased to . It was available only as a conversion for the L-1011-1. The -150 involves the conversion of Group 1 and Group 2 L-1011-1 aircraft to an MTOW of , an increase of , about 10%, from the L-1011-1, giving the aircraft a slightly better range than the -50, but without the additional center-section fuel tank, less than the L-1011-100 aircraft. The first aircraft was converted by MBB at Lemwerder in Germany during the winter of 1988–89 and was subsequently handed over to Air Transat of Canada on May 11, 1989.

===L-1011-200===
The L-1011-200 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1-15), the third production model of the L-1011, was introduced in 1976. Although otherwise similar to the -100, the -200 uses Rolls-Royce RB.211-524B engines to improve its performance in hot and high-altitude conditions. Gulf Air used -200 models to replace its earlier-generation Vickers VC10 fleet.

Other than the engines, the basic TriStar -200 is identical to the -100, with center-section fuel, having a MTOW of , and fuel capacity of as the -100. An increase of gross weight to is possible, with the heavier aircraft offered by Lockheed as -200I or -200(Improved). Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) was a launch customer for the -200 series and operated a sizable fleet until 1998. A total of 24 L-1011-200 aircraft were built new, with the first delivered to Saudia on May 28, 1977. Like other TriStar improvements, a conversion program has also been offered.

===L-1011-250===
The L-1011-250 was an upgrade developed for late-model L-1011-1 aircraft and all L-1011-100 and L-1011-200 aircraft. The more powerful engines, lengthened wing, active-load-control ailerons and other systems that had been developed for the L-1011-500 were adapted into the baseline model. The changes resulted in increases in maximum takeoff weight to and fuel capacity from 23,600 US gal (89,335 L) to 31,632 US gal (119,735 L). This variant also used the upgraded RB211-524B4I engine, which could be easily retrofitted to the existing RB211-524B powerplants of the L-1011-200, but it required a re-engining on the L-1011-1 and L-1011-100, which used the original RB211-22B. The conversion allowed the L-1011 to match the performance of the long-range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30. Although it could be applied to all L-1011 models, the upgrade was only undertaken by Delta on six late-model L-1011-1 aircraft.

===L-1011-500===
The L-1011-500 (FAA certification L-1011-385-3) was the last L-1011 variant to enter production. It was a longer-range variant first flight-tested in 1978. Its fuselage length was shortened by and MTOW increased to allow higher fuel loads. More powerful RB.211-524 engines, increased wingspan, active-load-control ailerons and other improved systems were features introduced by Lockheed to exploit newly available technologies in the late 1970s. The -500 variant was popular among international operators and formed a significant portion of the L-1011 fleet of Delta and British Airways. However, it entered service seven years after the similar DC-10-30 entered service.
The TriStar 500 first flew on October 16, 1978, with the first delivery to British Airways on April 27, 1979. It entered service with British Airways on May 7, 1979, flying between London and Abu Dhabi. The last L-1011 produced was a TriStar 500, operated by the Las Vegas Sands.

====Dimensions====
The TriStar 500 has an overall length of and wingspan increased to (early TriStar versions originally had the TriStar 1 wing with a span of ). 

====Flying surfaces====
Lockheed developed some aerodynamic improvements for the TriStar 500 which included a modified wing-to-body fairing, a fillet below the central intake, extended wingtips, and &quot;active ailerons&quot; or active control system (ACS). The new fairing reduced drag, while the fillet reduced noise in the rear cabin. The wingtip extensions increased aspect ratio, thus reducing induced drag, but resulted in increased bending. The ACS developed to solve this, provided gust alleviation, improving ride during flight, reduced fuel burn, and increased fatigue life.

Earlier TriStar 500s were delivered with the standard wing; these were later retrofitted with ailerons and extended wingtips. Pan Am was the first customer to order the -500 with the extended wingtips and active ailerons. Aircraft serial number 1176, the first for Pan Am, was the first TriStar 500 to be fitted with them as standard.

====Powerplant====
The TriStar 500 is equipped with the more powerful RB211-524B engines. Initially rated at thrust each, the higher-thrust -524B4 Improved (also referred to as the -524B4I) later became available, which also offered improved fuel efficiency.

====Performance====
Originally certified with an MTOW of , an increased MTOW of was later certified in 1979, and all earlier production aircraft were certified at this weight. A further increase, to , is also available, and most TriStar 500s are thought to have had this increase. Standard fuel capacity is , giving the TriStar 500 a range of about with 246 passengers and baggage.

====Cabin====
The TriStar 500&#x27;s maximum passenger capacity is 315, although no aircraft were operated with that number of seats. A typical two-class layout might include 21 First Class and 229 Economy Class for a maximum of 250 passengers. More spacious three-class layouts used on longer routes include 233 with 12 First Class, 32 Business Class, and 189 Economy Class with Delta Air Lines. The aircraft is equipped with six exits, two fewer than the long-body TriStars, thus reducing the exit limit maximum.

==Operators==
One L-1011 TriStar is in service as of 2024 which is the &quot;Stargazer&quot; air-launch mothership, operated by Northrop Grumman Space Systems.

==Accidents and incidents==
As of December 2011, the L-1011 has been involved in 35 aviation occurrences, including 10 hull-losses, with 540 fatalities. Of the four pioneering widebody aircraft (Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, L-1011, and Airbus A300/A310 family), the Lockheed L-1011 had comparatively few accidents and a better safety record than its competitors.
* On December 29, 1972, Eastern Air Lines Flight 401, an L-1011, crashed in the Florida Everglades as a result of the flight crew&#x27;s failure to monitor the flight instruments during a malfunction of the landing gear position indicator system. The crash resulted in 101 fatalities, and was the subject of two TV movies, &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Flight 401&quot;. It was also the subject of a &quot;Mayday&quot; episode.
* On April 12, 1977, Delta Air Lines Flight 1080, on takeoff from San Diego, had a left stabilizer jammed undetected in the full trailing-edge-up position. This failure resulted in a large noseup and rolling moment that almost exceeded the capability of the flight controls. The airplane was just about to stall in the clouds when Captain Jack McMahan, with unusual insight, reduced power on the wing engines and began using the throttles to supplement the remaining flight controls, using differential and collective engine thrust. Cabin crew moved all the passengers forward in the cabin to redistribute weight and help get the nose down. Steve Heidt, the flight engineer, said, &quot;It probably didn&#x27;t help much, but in that situation, we figured every little bit would help.&quot; All the way from San Diego to Los Angeles, the aircraft flew with its pitch controlled by differential thrust between tail and wing engines, while the left roll tendency was compensated by wing differential thrust, and made a successful emergency landing in Los Angeles. According to an incident analysis by Warren VanderBurgh, comprehensive crew training played a critical role in control recovery.
* On August 19, 1980, a fire destroyed the L-1011-200 used for Saudia Flight 163 on the ground after the pilots made an emergency landing at Riyadh&#x27;s former International Airport due to fire in the rear of the aircraft. Delays in initiating the evacuation of the aircraft led to the deaths of all 301 occupants.
* On December 23, 1980, Saudia Flight 162, an L-1011, had a tire explode and penetrate the passenger cabin whilst in flight. The aircraft lost cabin pressure and two passengers were ejected through a hole in the cabin floor. The aircraft was later repaired and returned to service.
* On September 22, 1981, Eastern Air Lines Flight 935 departed Newark, New Jersey, and suffered an uncontained failure of its number two (tail) engine at , while en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico. The fragments from that engine damaged three of its four hydraulic systems resulting in fluid loss in them. The rudder pedals also jammed. The fragments struck but did not puncture the lines for the other hydraulic system; the captain was able to safely land the aircraft at John F. Kennedy International Airport, with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries. The L-1011 having four hydraulic systems (instead of three like the DC-10) allowed for a safe landing.
* On May 5, 1983, Eastern Air Lines Flight 855, L-1011 registration N334EA, while flying from Miami to Nassau, shut down the number 2 engine due to low oil pressure and began a return to Miami. Both of the remaining engines later failed. Without power, Flight 855 descended from 13,000 to before the number 2 engine was restarted and the aircraft landed in Miami without injuries. Incorrect engine maintenance had led to the loss of oil on all three engines.
* On April 5, 1984, a Saudia Lockheed L-1011 TriStar on final approach to Damascus from Jeddah was hijacked by a Syrian national. The hijacker demanded to be taken to Istanbul, Turkey, but changed his mind and requested to go to Stockholm. After landing in Istanbul to refuel, the pilot pushed the hijacker out the emergency exit whereupon he was arrested.

* On May 27, 1985, British Airtours Flight 101, registration G-BBAI, from Palma Airport, Mallorca, Spain overran the runway on landing at Leeds Bradford International Airport, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom. 12 of the 412 people on board suffered minor injuries when exiting down steep rear ramps. The aircraft was severely damaged, but was eventually repaired and returned to service.
* On August 2, 1985, Delta Air Lines Flight 191, an L-1011, crashed while approaching Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in microburst conditions. The crash killed eight of 11 crew members and 128 of the 152 passengers on board, as well as one person on the ground.
* On October 18, 1985, a Jordanian Airlines L-1011 experienced an inflight fire at 24,000 feet while on approach to Singapore. The fire burned through the rear pressure bulkhead, causing explosive depressurization of the cabin. The air rushing out of the cabin extinguished the fire, saving the aircraft. All 118 passengers and crew survived. The aircraft was later repaired and placed back into service.
* On May 3, 1986, Air Lanka Flight 512 (now SriLankan Airlines), an L-1011, was destroyed on the ground in Colombo, Sri Lanka, after a bomb exploded in the rear cargo hold, severing the tail and killing 21 people.
* On June 28, 1991, LTU International L-1011 registration D-AERI, suffered an interior fire during maintenance in a hangar at Düsseldorf Airport. Four engineers escaped injury, and the aircraft was declared a total loss.
* On July 30, 1992, TWA Flight 843, an L-1011, had its takeoff aborted by the captain after liftoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport, in response to a false stall warning. The aircraft landed too hard, breaking a wing spar and starting a fire. All 292 passengers and crew evacuated safely, with only 10 minor injuries. The airliner was destroyed by fire.
* On August 23, 1995, Delta Air Lines Flight 157, an L-1011 TriStar 1, suffered a rapid decompression after the pressure bulkhead failed. The flight crew initiated an emergency descent to 14,000 feet, and the plane landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport with no deaths or injuries to the 226 passengers or 10 crew. The aircraft was substantially damaged and later written off.

<text>A turbofan or fanjet is a type of airbreathing jet engine that is widely used in aircraft propulsion. The word &quot;turbofan&quot; is a combination of references to the preceding generation engine technology of the turbojet and the additional fan stage. It consists of a gas turbine engine which achieves mechanical energy from combustion, and a ducted fan that uses the mechanical energy from the gas turbine to force air rearwards. Thus, whereas all the air taken in by a turbojet passes through the combustion chamber and turbines, in a turbofan some of that air bypasses these components. A turbofan thus can be thought of as a turbojet being used to drive a ducted fan, with both of these contributing to the thrust.

The ratio of the mass-flow of air bypassing the engine core to the mass-flow of air passing through the core is referred to as the bypass ratio. The engine produces thrust through a combination of these two portions working together. Engines that use more jet thrust relative to fan thrust are known as &quot;low-bypass turbofans&quot;; conversely those that have considerably more fan thrust than jet thrust are known as &quot;high-bypass&quot;. Most commercial aviation jet engines in use are of the high-bypass type, and most modern fighter engines are low-bypass. Afterburners are used on low-bypass turbofan engines with bypass and core mixing before the afterburner.

Modern turbofans have either a large single-stage fan or a smaller fan with several stages. An early configuration combined a low-pressure turbine and fan in a single rear-mounted unit.

==Principles==

The turbofan was invented to improve the fuel consumption of the turbojet. It achieves this by pushing more air, thus increasing the mass and lowering the speed of the propelling jet compared to that of the turbojet. This is done mechanically by adding a ducted fan rather than using viscous forces. A vacuum ejector is used in conjunction with the fan as first envisaged by inventor Frank Whittle.

Whittle envisioned flight speeds of 500 mph in his March 1936 UK patent 471,368 &quot;Improvements relating to the propulsion of aircraft&quot;, in which he describes the principles behind the turbofan, although not called as such at that time. While the turbojet uses the gas from its thermodynamic cycle as its propelling jet, for aircraft speeds below 500 mph there are two penalties to this design which are addressed by the turbofan.

First, the energy required for a given thrust increases as you propel the exhaust air at ever greater speeds, so the efficiency can be improved by diverting energy to propel larger quantities of air at lower speeds than the core. A turbofan achieves this by using an additional turbine to drive a ducted fan to blow air that bypasses the high speed core. With a lower core thrust, most of the thrust now comes from the large mass of low speed bypass air, providing the same thrust with a reduced fuel burn.

The other penalty is that combustion is less efficient at lower speeds. Any action to reduce the fuel consumption of the engine by increasing its pressure ratio or turbine temperature to achieve better combustion causes a corresponding increase in pressure and temperature in the exhaust duct which in turn cause a higher gas speed from the propelling nozzle (and higher KE and wasted fuel). Although the engine would use less fuel to produce a pound of thrust, more fuel is wasted in the faster propelling jet. In other words, the independence of thermal and propulsive efficiencies, as exists with the piston engine/propeller combination which preceded the turbojet, is lost. In contrast, Roth considers regaining this independence the single most important feature of the turbofan which allows specific thrust to be chosen independently of the gas generator cycle.

The working substance of the thermodynamic cycle is the only mass accelerated to produce thrust in a turbojet which is a serious limitation (high fuel consumption) for aircraft speeds below supersonic. For subsonic flight speeds the speed of the propelling jet has to be reduced because there is a price to be paid in producing the thrust. The energy required to accelerate the gas inside the engine (increase in kinetic energy) is expended in two ways, by producing a change in momentum ( i.e. a force), and a wake which is an unavoidable consequence of producing thrust by an airbreathing engine (or propeller). The wake velocity, and fuel burned to produce it, can be reduced and the required thrust still maintained by increasing the mass accelerated. A turbofan does this by transferring energy available inside the engine, from the gas generator, to a ducted fan which produces a second, additional mass of accelerated air.

The transfer of energy from the core to bypass air results in lower pressure and temperature gas entering the core nozzle (lower exhaust velocity), and fan-produced higher pressure and temperature bypass-air entering the fan nozzle. The amount of energy transferred depends on how much pressure rise the fan is designed to produce (fan pressure ratio). The best energy exchange (lowest fuel consumption) between the two flows, and how the jet velocities compare, depends on how efficiently the transfer takes place which depends on the losses in the fan-turbine and fan.

The fan flow has lower exhaust velocity, giving much more thrust per unit energy (lower specific thrust). Both airstreams contribute to the gross thrust of the engine. The additional air for the bypass stream increases the ram drag in the air intake stream-tube, but there is still a significant increase in net thrust. The overall effective exhaust velocity of the two exhaust jets can be made closer to a normal subsonic aircraft&#x27;s flight speed and gets closer to the ideal Froude efficiency. A turbofan accelerates a larger mass of air more slowly, compared to a turbojet which accelerates a smaller amount more quickly, which is a less efficient way to generate the same thrust (see the efficiency section below).

The ratio of the mass-flow of air bypassing the engine core compared to the mass-flow of air passing through the core is referred to as the bypass ratio. Engines with more jet thrust relative to fan thrust are known as &quot;low-bypass turbofans&quot;, those that have considerably more fan thrust than jet thrust are known as &quot;high-bypass&quot;. Most commercial aviation jet engines in use are high-bypass, and most modern fighter engines are low-bypass. Afterburners are used on low-bypass turbofans on combat aircraft.

=== Bypass ratio ===

The &quot;bypass ratio (BPR)&quot; of a turbofan engine is the ratio between the mass flow rate of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core. A bypass ratio of 6, for example, means that 6 times more air passes through the bypass duct than the amount that passes through the combustion chamber.

Turbofan engines are usually described in terms of BPR, which together with overall pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature and fan pressure ratio are important design parameters. In addition BPR is quoted for turboprop and unducted fan installations because their high propulsive efficiency gives them the overall efficiency characteristics of very high bypass turbofans. This allows them to be shown together with turbofans on plots which show trends of reducing specific fuel consumption (SFC) with increasing BPR. BPR can also be quoted for lift fan installations where the fan airflow is remote from the engine and doesn&#x27;t flow past the engine core.

Considering a constant core (i.e. fixed pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature), core and bypass jet velocities equal and a particular flight condition (i.e. Mach number and altitude) the fuel consumption per lb of thrust (sfc) decreases with increase in BPR. At the same time gross and net thrusts increase, but by different amounts. There is considerable potential for reducing fuel consumption for the same core cycle by increasing BPR.This is achieved because of the reduction in pounds of thrust per lb/sec of airflow (specific thrust) and the resultant reduction in lost kinetic energy in the jets (increase in propulsive efficiency).

If all the gas power from a gas turbine is converted to kinetic energy in a propelling nozzle, the aircraft is best suited to high supersonic speeds. If it is all transferred to a separate big mass of air with low kinetic energy, the aircraft is best suited to zero speed (hovering). For speeds in between, the gas power is shared between a separate airstream and the gas turbine&#x27;s own nozzle flow in a proportion which gives the aircraft performance required. The trade off between mass flow and velocity is also seen with propellers and helicopter rotors by comparing disc loading and power loading. For example, the same helicopter weight can be supported by a high power engine and small diameter rotor or, for less fuel, a lower power engine and bigger rotor with lower velocity through the rotor.

Bypass usually refers to transferring gas power from a gas turbine to a bypass stream of air to reduce fuel consumption and jet noise. Alternatively, there may be a requirement for an afterburning engine where the sole requirement for bypass is to provide cooling air. This sets the lower limit for BPR and these engines have been called &quot;leaky&quot; or continuous bleed turbojets (General Electric YJ-101 BPR 0.25) and low BPR turbojets (Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120). Low BPR (0.2) has also been used to provide surge margin as well as afterburner cooling for the Pratt &amp; Whitney J58.

===Efficiency===
Propeller engines are most efficient for low speeds, turbojet engines for high speeds, and turbofan engines between the two. Turbofans are the most efficient engines in the range of speeds from about , the speed at which most commercial aircraft operate.

In a turbojet (zero-bypass) engine, the high temperature and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated when it undergoes expansion through a propelling nozzle and produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs the mechanical power produced by the turbine. In a bypass design, extra turbines drive a ducted fan that accelerates air rearward from the front of the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to turboprops in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine&#x27;s gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the hot nozzle to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between turbojets, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and turbo-props which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less). Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gives significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller are added to the turbojet&#x27;s low-loss propelling nozzle. The turbofan has additional losses from its greater number of compressor stages/blades, fan and bypass duct.

Froude, or propulsive, efficiency can be defined as:

formula_1

where:

* = thrust equivalent jet velocity
* = aircraft velocity

===Thrust===
While a turbojet engine uses all of the engine&#x27;s output to produce thrust in the form of a hot high-velocity exhaust gas jet, a turbofan&#x27;s cool low-velocity bypass air yields between 30% and 70% of the total thrust produced by a turbofan system.

The thrust (FN) generated by a turbofan depends on the effective exhaust velocity of the total exhaust, as with any jet engine, but because two exhaust jets are present the thrust equation can be expanded as:

formula_2

where:

* = the mass rate of hot combustion exhaust flow from the core engine 
* = the mass rate of total air flow entering the turbofan = 
* = the mass rate of intake air that flows to the core engine
* = the mass rate of intake air that bypasses the core engine
* = the velocity of the air flow bypassed around the core engine
* = the velocity of the hot exhaust gas from the core engine
* = the velocity of the total air intake = the true airspeed of the aircraft
* = bypass ratio

===Nozzles===
The cold duct and core duct&#x27;s nozzle systems are relatively complex due to the use of two separate exhaust flows. In high bypass engines, the fan is situated in a short duct near the front of the engine and typically has a convergent cold nozzle, with the tail of the duct forming a low pressure ratio nozzle that under normal conditions will choke creating supersonic flow patterns around the core. The core nozzle is more conventional, but generates less of the thrust, and depending on design choices, such as noise considerations, may conceivably not choke. In low bypass engines the two flows may combine within the ducts, and share a common nozzle, which can be fitted with afterburner.

=== Noise ===

Most of the air flow through a high-bypass turbofan is lower-velocity bypass flow: even when combined with the much-higher-velocity engine exhaust, the average exhaust velocity is considerably lower than in a pure turbojet. Turbojet engine noise is predominately jet noise from the high exhaust velocity. Therefore, turbofan engines are significantly quieter than a pure-jet of the same thrust, and jet noise is no longer the predominant source. Turbofan engine noise propagates both upstream via the inlet and downstream via the primary nozzle and the by-pass duct. Other noise sources are the fan, compressor and turbine.

Modern commercial aircraft employ high-bypass-ratio (HBPR) engines with separate flow, non-mixing, short-duct exhaust systems. Their noise at takeoff is primarily from the fan and jet. The primary source of jet noise is the turbulent mixing of shear layers in the engine&#x27;s exhaust. These shear layers contain instabilities that lead to highly turbulent vortices that generate the pressure fluctuations responsible for sound. To reduce the noise associated with jet flow, the aerospace industry has sought to disrupt shear layer turbulence and reduce the overall noise produced.

Fan noise may come from the interaction of the fan-blade wakes with the pressure field of the downstream fan-exit stator vanes. It may be minimized by adequate axial spacing between blade trailing edge and stator entrance.
At high engine speeds, as at takeoff, shock waves from the supersonic fan tips, because of their unequal nature, produce noise of a discordant nature known as &quot;buzz saw&quot; noise.

All modern turbofan engines have acoustic liners in the nacelle to damp their noise. They extend as much as possible to cover the largest surface area. The acoustic performance of the engine can be experimentally evaluated by means of ground tests or in dedicated experimental test rigs.

In the aerospace industry, chevrons are the &quot;saw-tooth&quot; patterns on the trailing edges of some jet engine nozzles that are used for noise reduction. The shaped edges smooth the mixing of hot air from the engine core and cooler air flowing through the engine fan, which reduces noise-creating turbulence. Chevrons were developed by GE under a NASA contract. Some notable examples of such designs are Boeing 787 and Boeing 747-8 on the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 and General Electric GEnx engines.

==History==
Early turbojet engines were not very fuel-efficient because their overall pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature were severely limited by the technology and materials available at the time.

The first turbofan engine, which was only run on a test bed, was the German Daimler-Benz DB 670, designated the 109-007 by the German RLM (Ministry of Aviation), with a first run date of 27 May 1943, after the testing of the turbomachinery using an electric motor, which had been undertaken on 1 April 1943. Development of the engine was abandoned with its problems unsolved, as the war situation worsened for Germany.

Later in 1943, the British ground tested the Metrovick F.3 turbofan, which used the Metrovick F.2 turbojet as a gas generator with the exhaust discharging into a close-coupled aft-fan module comprising a contra-rotating LP turbine system driving two co-axial contra-rotating fans.

Improved materials, and the introduction of twin compressors, such as in the Bristol Olympus, and Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C engines, increased the overall pressure ratio and thus the thermodynamic efficiency of engines. They also had poor propulsive efficiency, because pure turbojets have a high specific thrust/high velocity exhaust, which is better suited to supersonic flight.

The original low-bypass turbofan engines were designed to improve propulsive efficiency by reducing the exhaust velocity to a value closer to that of the aircraft. The Rolls-Royce Conway, the world&#x27;s first production turbofan, had a bypass ratio of 0.3, similar to the modern General Electric F404 fighter engine. Civilian turbofan engines of the 1960s, such as the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D and the Rolls-Royce Spey, had bypass ratios closer to 1 and were similar to their military equivalents.

The first Soviet airliner powered by turbofan engines was the Tupolev Tu-124 introduced in 1962. It used the Soloviev D-20. 164 aircraft were produced between 1960 and 1965 for Aeroflot and other Eastern Bloc airlines, with some operating until the early 1990s.

The first General Electric turbofan was the aft-fan CJ805-23, based on the CJ805-3 turbojet. It was followed by the aft-fan General Electric CF700 engine, with a 2.0 bypass ratio. This was derived from the General Electric J85/CJ610 turbojet to power the larger Rockwell Sabreliner 75/80 model aircraft, as well as the Dassault Falcon 20, with about a 50% increase in thrust to . The CF700 was the first small turbofan to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). There were at one time over 400 CF700 aircraft in operation around the world, with an experience base of over 10 million service hours. The CF700 turbofan engine was also used to train Moon-bound astronauts in Project Apollo as the powerplant for the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle.

==Common types==
===Low-bypass turbofan===

A high-specific-thrust/low-bypass-ratio turbofan normally has a multi-stage fan behind inlet guide vanes, developing a relatively high pressure ratio and, thus, yielding a high (mixed or cold) exhaust velocity. The core airflow needs to be large enough to ensure there is sufficient core power to drive the fan. A smaller core flow/higher bypass ratio cycle can be achieved by raising the inlet temperature of the high-pressure (HP) turbine rotor.

To illustrate one aspect of how a turbofan differs from a turbojet, comparisons can be made at the same airflow (to keep a common intake for example) and the same net thrust (i.e. same specific thrust). A bypass flow can be added only if the turbine inlet temperature is not too high to compensate for the smaller core flow. Future improvements in turbine cooling/material technology can allow higher turbine inlet temperature, which is necessary because of increased cooling air temperature, resulting from an overall pressure ratio increase.

The resulting turbofan, with reasonable efficiencies and duct loss for the added components, would probably operate at a higher nozzle pressure ratio than the turbojet, but with a lower exhaust temperature to retain net thrust. Since the temperature rise across the whole engine (intake to nozzle) would be lower, the (dry power) fuel flow would also be reduced, resulting in a better specific fuel consumption (SFC).

Some low-bypass ratio military turbofans (e.g. F404, JT8D) have variable inlet guide vanes to direct air onto the first fan rotor stage. This improves the fan surge margin (see compressor map).

=== Afterburning turbofan ===

Since the 1970s, most jet fighter engines have been low/medium bypass turbofans with a mixed exhaust, afterburner and variable area exit nozzle. An afterburner is a combustor located downstream of the turbine blades and directly upstream of the nozzle, which burns fuel from afterburner-specific fuel injectors. When lit, large volumes of fuel are burnt in the afterburner, raising the temperature of exhaust gases by a significant degree, resulting in a higher exhaust velocity/engine specific thrust. The variable geometry nozzle must open to a larger throat area to accommodate the extra volume and increased flow rate when the afterburner is lit. Afterburning is often designed to give a significant thrust boost for take off, transonic acceleration and combat maneuvers, but is very fuel intensive. Consequently, afterburning can be used only for short portions of a mission.

Unlike in the main engine, where stoichiometric temperatures in the combustor have to be reduced before they reach the turbine, an afterburner at maximum fuelling is designed to produce stoichiometric temperatures at entry to the nozzle, about . At a fixed total applied fuel:air ratio, the total fuel flow for a given fan airflow will be the same, regardless of the dry specific thrust of the engine. However, a high specific thrust turbofan will, by definition, have a higher nozzle pressure ratio, resulting in a higher afterburning net thrust and, therefore, a lower afterburning specific fuel consumption (SFC). However, high specific thrust engines have a high dry SFC. The situation is reversed for a medium specific thrust afterburning turbofan: i.e., poor afterburning SFC/good dry SFC. The former engine is suitable for a combat aircraft which must remain in afterburning combat for a fairly long period, but has to fight only fairly close to the airfield (e.g. cross border skirmishes). The latter engine is better for an aircraft that has to fly some distance, or loiter for a long time, before going into combat. However, the pilot can afford to stay in afterburning only for a short period, before aircraft fuel reserves become dangerously low.

The first production afterburning turbofan engine was the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30, which initially powered the F-111 Aardvark and F-14 Tomcat. Low-bypass military turbofans include the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119, the Eurojet EJ200, the General Electric F110, the Klimov RD-33, and the Saturn AL-31, all of which feature a mixed exhaust, afterburner and variable area propelling nozzle.

=== High-bypass turbofan ===


To further improve fuel economy and reduce noise, almost all jet airliners and most military transport aircraft (e.g., the C-17) are powered by low-specific-thrust/high-bypass-ratio turbofans. These engines evolved from the high-specific-thrust/low-bypass-ratio turbofans used in such aircraft in the 1960s. Modern combat aircraft tend to use low-bypass ratio turbofans, and some military transport aircraft use turboprops.

Low specific thrust is achieved by replacing the multi-stage fan with a single-stage unit. Unlike some military engines, modern civil turbofans lack stationary inlet guide vanes in front of the fan rotor. The fan is scaled to achieve the desired net thrust.

The core (or gas generator) of the engine must generate enough power to drive the fan at its rated mass flow and pressure ratio. Improvements in turbine cooling/material technology allow for a higher (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, which allows a smaller (and lighter) core, potentially improving the core thermal efficiency. Reducing the core mass flow tends to increase the load on the LP turbine, so this unit may require additional stages to reduce the average stage loading and to maintain LP turbine efficiency. Reducing core flow also increases bypass ratio. Bypass ratios greater than 5:1 are increasingly common; the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G, which entered commercial service in 2016, attains 12.5:1.

Further improvements in core thermal efficiency can be achieved by raising the overall pressure ratio of the core. Improvements in blade aerodynamics can reduce the number of extra compressor stages required, and variable geometry stators enable high-pressure-ratio compressors to work surge-free at all throttle settings.

The first (experimental) high-bypass turbofan engine was the AVCO-Lycoming PLF1A-2, a Honeywell T55 turboshaft-derived engine that was first run in February 1962. The PLF1A-2 had a geared fan stage, produced a static thrust of , and had a bypass ratio of 6:1. The General Electric TF39 became the first production model, designed to power the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy military transport aircraft. The civil General Electric CF6 engine used a derived design. Other high-bypass turbofans are the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D, the three-shaft Rolls-Royce RB211 and the CFM International CFM56; also the smaller TF34. More recent large high-bypass turbofans include the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, the three-shaft Rolls-Royce Trent, the General Electric GE90/GEnx and the GP7000, produced jointly by GE and P&amp;W. The Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engine was the first high bypass ratio jet engine to power a wide-body airliner.

The lower the specific thrust of a turbofan, the lower the mean jet outlet velocity, which in turn translates into a high thrust lapse rate (i.e. decreasing thrust with increasing flight speed). See technical discussion below, item 2. Consequently, an engine sized to propel an aircraft at high subsonic flight speed (e.g., Mach 0.83) generates a relatively high thrust at low flight speed, thus enhancing runway performance. Low specific thrust engines tend to have a high bypass ratio, but this is also a function of the temperature of the turbine system.

The turbofans on twin-engined transport aircraft produce enough take-off thrust to continue a take-off on one engine if the other engine shuts down after a critical point in the take-off run. From that point on the aircraft has less than half the thrust compared to two operating engines because the non-functioning engine is a source of drag. Modern twin engined airliners normally climb very steeply immediately after take-off. If one engine shuts down, the climb-out is much shallower, but sufficient to clear obstacles in the flightpath.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s engine technology was less advanced than the West&#x27;s, and its first wide-body aircraft, the Ilyushin Il-86, was powered by low-bypass engines. The Yakovlev Yak-42, a medium-range, rear-engined aircraft seating up to 120 passengers, introduced in 1980, was the first Soviet aircraft to use high-bypass engines.

==Turbofan configurations==
Turbofan engines come in a variety of engine configurations. For a given engine cycle (i.e., same airflow, bypass ratio, fan pressure ratio, overall pressure ratio and HP turbine rotor inlet temperature), the choice of turbofan configuration has little impact upon the design point performance (e.g., net thrust, SFC), as long as overall component performance is maintained. Off-design performance and stability is, however, affected by engine configuration.

The basic element of a turbofan is a spool, a single combination of fan/compressor, turbine and shaft rotating at a single speed. For a given pressure ratio, the surge margin can be increased by two different design paths:

# Splitting the compressor into two smaller spools rotating at different speeds, as with the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57; or
# Making the stator vane pitch adjustable, typically in the front stages, as with the J79.

Most modern western civil turbofans employ a relatively high-pressure-ratio high-pressure (HP) compressor, with many rows of variable stators to control surge margin at low rpm. In the three-spool RB211/Trent the core compression system is split into two, with the IP compressor, which supercharges the HP compressor, being on a different coaxial shaft and driven by a separate (IP) turbine. As the HP compressor has a modest pressure ratio its speed can be reduced surge-free, without employing variable geometry. However, because a shallow IP compressor working line is inevitable, the IPC has one stage of variable geometry on all variants except the −535, which has none.

===Single-shaft turbofan===
Although far from common, the single-shaft turbofan is probably the simplest configuration, comprising a fan and high-pressure compressor driven by a single turbine unit, all on the same spool. The Snecma M53, which powers Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft, is an example of a single-shaft turbofan. Despite the simplicity of the turbomachinery configuration, the M53 requires a variable area mixer to facilitate part-throttle operation.

===Aft-fan turbofan===
One of the earliest turbofans was a derivative of the General Electric J79 turbojet, known as the CJ805-23, which featured an integrated aft fan/low-pressure (LP) turbine unit located in the turbojet exhaust jetpipe. Hot gas from the turbojet turbine exhaust expanded through the LP turbine, the fan blades being a radial extension of the turbine blades. This arrangement introduces an additional gas leakage path compared to a front-fan configuration and was a problem with this engine with higher-pressure turbine gas leaking into the fan airflow. An aft-fan configuration was later used for the General Electric GE36 UDF (propfan) demonstrator of the early 1980s.

In 1971 a concept was put forward by the NASA Lewis Research Center for a supersonic transport engine which operated as an aft-fan turbofan at take-off and subsonic speeds and a turbojet at higher speeds. This would give the low noise and high thrust characteristics of a turbofan at take-off, together with turbofan high propulsive efficiency at subsonic flight speeds. It would have the high propulsive efficiency of a turbojet at supersonic cruise speeds.

===Basic two-spool===
Many turbofans have at least basic two-spool configuration where the fan is on a separate low pressure (LP) spool, running concentrically with the compressor or high pressure (HP) spool; the LP spool runs at a lower angular velocity, while the HP spool turns faster and its compressor further compresses part of the air for combustion. The BR710 is typical of this configuration. At the smaller thrust sizes, instead of all-axial blading, the HP compressor configuration may be axial-centrifugal (e.g., CFE CFE738), double-centrifugal or even diagonal/centrifugal (e.g. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW600).

===Boosted two-spool===
Higher overall pressure ratios can be achieved by either raising the HP compressor pressure ratio or adding compressor (non-bypass) stages to the LP spool, between the fan and the HP compressor, to boost the latter. All of the large American turbofans (e.g. General Electric CF6, GE90, GE9X and GEnx plus Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D and PW4000) use booster stages. The Rolls-Royce BR715 is another example. The high bypass ratios used in modern civil turbofans tend to reduce the relative diameter of the booster stages, reducing their mean tip speed. Consequently, more booster stages are required to develop the necessary pressure rise.

===Three-spool===
Rolls-Royce chose a three-spool configuration for their large civil turbofans (i.e. the RB211 and Trent families), where the booster stages of a boosted two-spool configuration are separated into an intermediate pressure (IP) spool, driven by its own turbine. The first three-spool engine was the earlier Rolls-Royce RB.203 Trent of 1967.

The Garrett ATF3, powering the Dassault Falcon 20 business jet, has an unusual three spool layout with an aft spool not concentric with the two others.

Ivchenko Design Bureau chose the same configuration as Rolls-Royce for their Lotarev D-36 engine, followed by Lotarev/Progress D-18T and Progress D-436.

The Turbo-Union RB199 military turbofan also has a three-spool configuration, as do the military Kuznetsov NK-25 and NK-321.

===Geared fan===

As bypass ratio increases, the fan blade tip speed increases relative to the LPT blade speed. This will reduce the LPT blade speed, requiring more turbine stages to extract enough energy to drive the fan. Introducing a (planetary) reduction gearbox, with a suitable gear ratio, between the LP shaft and the fan enables both the fan and LP turbine to operate at their optimum speeds. Examples of this configuration are the long-established Garrett TFE731, the Honeywell ALF 502/507, and the recent Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G.

===Military turbofans===
Most of the configurations discussed above are used in civilian turbofans, while modern military turbofans (e.g., Snecma M88) are usually basic two-spool.

===High-pressure turbine===
Most civil turbofans use a high-efficiency, 2-stage HP turbine to drive the HP compressor. The CFM International CFM56 uses an alternative approach: a single-stage, high-work unit. While this approach is probably less efficient, there are savings on cooling air, weight and cost.

In the RB211 and Trent 3-spool engine series, the HP compressor pressure ratio is modest so only a single HP turbine stage is required. Modern military turbofans also tend to use a single HP turbine stage and a modest HP compressor.

===Low-pressure turbine===
Modern civil turbofans have multi-stage LP turbines (anywhere from 3 to 7). The number of stages required depends on the engine cycle bypass ratio and the boost (on boosted two-spools). A geared fan may reduce the number of required LPT stages in some applications. Because of the much lower bypass ratios employed, military turbofans require only one or two LP turbine stages.

==Overall performance==

===Cycle improvements===

Consider a mixed turbofan with a fixed bypass ratio and airflow. Increasing the overall pressure ratio of the compression system raises the combustor entry temperature. Therefore, at a fixed fuel flow there is an increase in (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature. Although the higher temperature rise across the compression system implies a larger temperature drop over the turbine system, the mixed nozzle temperature is unaffected, because the same amount of heat is being added to the system. There is, however, a rise in nozzle pressure, because overall pressure ratio increases faster than the turbine expansion ratio, causing an increase in the hot mixer entry pressure. Consequently, net thrust increases, whilst specific fuel consumption (fuel flow/net thrust) decreases. A similar trend occurs with unmixed turbofans.

Turbofan engines can be made more fuel efficient by raising overall pressure ratio and turbine rotor inlet temperature in unison. However, better turbine materials or improved vane/blade cooling are required to cope with increases in both turbine rotor inlet temperature and compressor delivery temperature. Increasing the latter may require better compressor materials.

The overall pressure ratio can be increased by improving fan (or) LP compressor pressure ratio or HP compressor pressure ratio. If the latter is held constant, the increase in (HP) compressor delivery temperature (from raising overall pressure ratio) implies an increase in HP mechanical speed. However, stressing considerations might limit this parameter, implying, despite an increase in overall pressure ratio, a reduction in HP compressor pressure ratio.

According to simple theory, if the ratio of turbine rotor inlet temperature/(HP) compressor delivery temperature is maintained, the HP turbine throat area can be retained. However, this assumes that cycle improvements are obtained, while retaining the datum (HP) compressor exit flow function (non-dimensional flow). In practice, changes to the non-dimensional speed of the (HP) compressor and cooling bleed extraction would probably make this assumption invalid, making some adjustment to HP turbine throat area unavoidable. This means the HP turbine nozzle guide vanes would have to be different from the original. In all probability, the downstream LP turbine nozzle guide vanes would have to be changed anyway.

===Thrust growth===

Thrust growth is obtained by increasing core power. There are two basic routes available:
# hot route: increase HP turbine rotor inlet temperature
# cold route: increase core mass flow

Both routes require an increase in the combustor fuel flow and, therefore, the heat energy added to the core stream.

The hot route may require changes in turbine blade/vane materials or better blade/vane cooling. The cold route can be obtained by one of the following:

# adding booster stages to the LP/IP compression
# adding a zero-stage to the HP compression
# improving the compression process, without adding stages (e.g. higher fan hub pressure ratio)

all of which increase both overall pressure ratio and core airflow.

Alternatively, the core size can be increased, to raise core airflow, without changing overall pressure ratio. This route is expensive, since a new (upflowed) turbine system (and possibly a larger IP compressor) is also required.

Changes must also be made to the fan to absorb the extra core power. On a civil engine, jet noise considerations mean that any significant increase in take-off thrust must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in fan mass flow (to maintain a T/O specific thrust of about 30 lbf/lb/s).

===Technical discussion===
# Specific thrust (net thrust/intake airflow) is an important parameter for turbofans and jet engines in general. Imagine a fan (driven by an appropriately sized electric motor) operating within a pipe, which is connected to a propelling nozzle. It is fairly obvious, the higher the fan pressure ratio (fan discharge pressure/fan inlet pressure), the higher the jet velocity and the corresponding specific thrust. Now imagine we replace this set-up with an equivalent turbofan – same airflow and same fan pressure ratio. Obviously, the core of the turbofan must produce sufficient power to drive the fan via the low-pressure (LP) turbine. If we choose a low (HP) turbine inlet temperature for the gas generator, the core airflow needs to be relatively high to compensate. The corresponding bypass ratio is therefore relatively low. If we raise the turbine inlet temperature, the core airflow can be smaller, thus increasing bypass ratio. Raising turbine inlet temperature tends to increase thermal efficiency and, therefore, improve fuel efficiency.
# Naturally, as altitude increases, there is a decrease in air density and, therefore, the net thrust of an engine. There is also a flight speed effect, termed thrust lapse rate. Consider the approximate equation for net thrust again:formula_3 With a high specific thrust (e.g., fighter) engine, the jet velocity is relatively high, so intuitively one can see that increases in flight velocity have less of an impact upon net thrust than a medium specific thrust (e.g., trainer) engine, where the jet velocity is lower. The impact of thrust lapse rate upon a low specific thrust (e.g., civil) engine is even more severe. At high flight speeds, high-specific-thrust engines can pick up net thrust through the ram rise in the intake, but this effect tends to diminish at supersonic speeds because of shock wave losses.
# Thrust growth on civil turbofans is usually obtained by increasing fan airflow, thus preventing the jet noise becoming too high. However, the larger fan airflow requires more power from the core. This can be achieved by raising the overall pressure ratio (combustor inlet pressure/intake delivery pressure) to induce more airflow into the core and by increasing turbine inlet temperature. Together, these parameters tend to increase core thermal efficiency and improve fuel efficiency.
# Some high-bypass-ratio civil turbofans use an extremely low area ratio (less than 1.01), convergent-divergent, nozzle on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream, to control the fan working line. The nozzle acts as if it has variable geometry. At low flight speeds the nozzle is unchoked (less than a Mach number of unity), so the exhaust gas speeds up as it approaches the throat and then slows down slightly as it reaches the divergent section. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match and, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan working line slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake increases nozzle pressure ratio to the point where the throat becomes choked (M=1.0). Under these circumstances, the throat area dictates the fan match and, being smaller than the exit, pushes the fan working line slightly towards surge. This is not a problem, since fan surge margin is much better at high flight speeds.
# The off-design behaviour of turbofans is illustrated under compressor map and turbine map.
# Because modern civil turbofans operate at low specific thrust, they require only a single fan stage to develop the required fan pressure ratio. The desired overall pressure ratio for the engine cycle is usually achieved by multiple axial stages on the core compression. Rolls-Royce tend to split the core compression into two with an intermediate pressure (IP) supercharging the HP compressor, both units being driven by turbines with a single stage, mounted on separate shafts. Consequently, the HP compressor need develop only a modest pressure ratio (e.g., ~4.5:1). US civil engines use much higher HP compressor pressure ratios (e.g., ~23:1 on the General Electric GE90) and tend to be driven by a two-stage HP turbine. Even so, there are usually a few IP axial stages mounted on the LP shaft, behind the fan, to further supercharge the core compression system. Civil engines have multi-stage LP turbines, the number of stages being determined by the bypass ratio, the amount of IP compression on the LP shaft and the LP turbine blade speed.
# Because military engines usually have to be able to fly very fast at sea level, the limit on HP compressor delivery temperature is reached at a fairly modest design overall pressure ratio, compared with that of a civil engine. Also the fan pressure ratio is relatively high, to achieve a medium to high specific thrust. Consequently, modern military turbofans usually have only 5 or 6 HP compressor stages and require only a single-stage HP turbine. Low-bypass-ratio military turbofans usually have one LP turbine stage, but higher bypass ratio engines need two stages. In theory, by adding IP compressor stages, a modern military turbofan HP compressor could be used in a civil turbofan derivative, but the core would tend to be too small for high thrust applications.

== Improvements ==
=== Aerodynamic modelling ===
Aerodynamics is a mix of subsonic, transonic and supersonic airflow on a single fan/gas compressor blade in a modern turbofan. The airflow past the blades must be maintained within close angular limits to keep the air flowing against an increasing pressure. Otherwise air will be rejected back out of the intake.

The Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) needs accurate data for controlling the engine. The critical turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is too harsh an environment, at and , for reliable sensors. Therefore, during development of a new engine type a relation is established between a more easily measured temperature like exhaust gas temperature and the TIT. Monitoring the exhaust gas temperature is then used to make sure the engine does not run too hot.

=== Blade technology ===
A turbine blade with a weight of is subjected to , at and a centrifugal force of , well above the point of plastic deformation and even above the melting point.
Exotic alloys, sophisticated air cooling schemes and special mechanical design are needed to keep the physical stresses within the strength of the material.
Rotating seals must withstand harsh conditions for 10 years, 20,000 missions and rotating at 10 to 20,000 rpm.

=== Fan blades ===
Fan blades have been growing as jet engines have been getting bigger: each fan blade carries the equivalent of nine double-decker buses and swallows air the equivalent volume of a squash court every second.
Advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling have permitted complex, 3D curved shapes with very wide chord, keeping the fan capabilities while minimizing the blade count to lower costs.
Coincidentally, the bypass ratio grew to achieve higher propulsive efficiency and the fan diameter increased.

Rolls-Royce pioneered the hollow, titanium wide-chord fan blade in the 1980s for aerodynamic efficiency and foreign object damage resistance in the RB211 then for the Trent.
GE Aviation introduced carbon fiber composite fan blades on the GE90 in 1995, manufactured since 2017 with a carbon-fiber tape-layer process.
GE partner Safran developed a 3D woven technology with Albany Composites for the CFM56 and CFM LEAP engines.

=== Future progress ===
Engine cores are shrinking as they operate at higher pressure ratios and become more efficient and smaller compared to the fan as bypass ratios increase.
Blade tip clearances are more difficult to maintain at the exit of the high-pressure compressor where blades are high or less; backbone bending further affects clearance control as the core is proportionately longer and thinner and the fan to low-pressure turbine driveshaft space is constrained within the core.

Pratt &amp; Whitney VP technology and environment Alan Epstein argued &quot;Over the history of commercial aviation, we have gone from 20% to 40% [cruise efficiency], and there is a consensus among the engine community that we can probably get to 60%&quot;.
Geared turbofans and further fan pressure ratio reductions may continue to improve propulsive efficiency.
The second phase of the FAA&#x27;s Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) program is targeting for the late 2020s reductions of 33% fuel burn, 60% emissions and 32 dB EPNdb noise compared with the 2000s state-of-the-art.
In summer 2017 at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, Pratt has finished testing a very-low-pressure-ratio fan on a PW1000G, resembling an open rotor with fewer blades than the PW1000G&#x27;s 20.

The weight and size of the nacelle would be reduced by a short duct inlet, imposing higher aerodynamic turning loads on the blades and leaving less space for soundproofing, but a lower-pressure-ratio fan is slower.
UTC Aerospace Systems Aerostructures will have a full-scale ground test in 2019 of its low-drag Integrated Propulsion System with a thrust reverser, improving fuel burn by 1% and with 2.5-3 EPNdB lower noise.
Safran expects to deliver another 10–15% in fuel efficiency through the mid-2020s before reaching an asymptote, and next will have to increase the bypass ratio to 35:1 instead of 11:1 for the CFM LEAP. It is demonstrating a counterrotating open rotor unducted fan (propfan) in Istres, France, under the European Clean Sky technology program.
Modeling advances and high specific strength materials may help it succeed where previous attempts failed.
When noise levels are within existing standards and similar to the LEAP engine, 15% lower fuel burn will be available and for that Safran is testing its controls, vibration and operation, while airframe integration is still challenging.
For GE Aviation, the energy density of jet fuel still maximises the Breguet range equation and higher pressure ratio cores; lower pressure ratio fans, low-loss inlets and lighter structures can further improve thermal, transfer and propulsive efficiency.
Under the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Adaptive Engine Transition Program, adaptive thermodynamic cycles will be used for the sixth-generation jet fighter, based on a modified Brayton cycle and Constant volume combustion.
Additive manufacturing in the advanced turboprop will reduce weight by 5% and fuel burn by 20%.

Rotating and static ceramic matrix composite (CMC) parts operates hotter than metal and are one-third its weight.
With $21.9 million from the Air Force Research Laboratory, GE is investing $200 million in a CMC facility in Huntsville, Alabama, in addition to its Asheville, North Carolina site, mass-producing silicon carbide matrix with silicon-carbide fibers in 2018.
CMCs will be used ten times more by the mid-2020s: the CFM LEAP requires 18 CMC turbine shrouds per engine and the GE9X will use it in the combustor and for 42 HP turbine nozzles.
Rolls-Royce Plc aim for a 60:1 pressure ratio core for the 2020s Ultrafan and began ground tests of its gear for and 15:1 bypass ratios.
Nearly stoichiometric turbine entry temperature approaches the theoretical limit and its impact on emissions has to be balanced with environmental performance goals.
Open rotors, lower pressure ratio fans and potentially distributed propulsion offer more room for better propulsive efficiency.
Exotic cycles, heat exchangers and pressure gain/constant volume combustion may improve thermodynamic efficiency.
Additive manufacturing could be an enabler for intercooler and recuperators.
Closer airframe integration and hybrid or electric aircraft can be combined with gas turbines.

Rolls-Royce engines have a 72–82% propulsive efficiency and 42–49% thermal efficiency for a TSFC at Mach 0.8, and aim for theoretical limits of 95% for open rotor propulsive efficiency and 60% for thermal efficiency with stoichiometric turbine entry temperature and 80:1 overall pressure ratio for a TSFC

As teething troubles may not show up until several thousand hours, the latest turbofans&#x27; technical problems disrupt airlines operations and manufacturers deliveries while production rates rise sharply.
Trent 1000 cracked blades grounded almost 50 Boeing 787s and reduced ETOPS to 2.3 hours down from 5.5, costing Rolls-Royce plc almost $950 million.
PW1000G knife-edge seal fractures have caused Pratt &amp; Whitney to fall behind in deliveries, leaving about 100 engineless A320neos waiting for their powerplants.
The CFM LEAP introduction had been smoother but a ceramic composite Turbine coating was prematurely lost, necessitating a new design, causing 60 A320neo engine removals for modification and delaying deliveries by up to six weeks late.

On a widebody, Safran estimates 5–10% of fuel could be saved by reducing power intake for hydraulic systems, while swapping to electrical power could save 30% of weight, as initiated on the Boeing 787, while Rolls-Royce plc hopes for up to 5%.

==Manufacturers==

The turbofan engine market is dominated by General Electric, Rolls-Royce plc and Pratt &amp; Whitney, in order of market share. General Electric and Safran of France have a joint venture, CFM International. Pratt &amp; Whitney also have a joint venture, International Aero Engines with Japanese Aero Engine Corporation and MTU Aero Engines of Germany, specializing in engines for the Airbus A320 family. Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric have a joint venture, Engine Alliance selling a range of engines for aircraft such as the Airbus A380.

For airliners and cargo aircraft, the in-service fleet in 2016 is 60,000 engines and should grow to 103,000 in 2035 with 86,500 deliveries according to Flight Global. A majority will be medium-thrust engines for narrow-body aircraft with 54,000 deliveries, for a fleet growing from 28,500 to 61,000. High-thrust engines for wide-body aircraft, worth 40–45% of the market by value, will grow from 12,700 engines to over 21,000 with 18,500 deliveries. The regional jet engines below 20,000 lb (89 kN) fleet will grow from 7,500 to 9,000 and the fleet of turboprops for airliners will increase from 9,400 to 10,200. The manufacturers market share should be led by CFM with 44% followed by Pratt &amp; Whitney with 29% and then Rolls-Royce and General Electric with 10% each.

=== Commercial turbofans in production ===
==Extreme bypass jet engines==

In the 1970s, Rolls-Royce/SNECMA tested a M45SD-02 turbofan fitted with variable-pitch fan blades to improve handling at ultralow fan pressure ratios and to provide thrust reverse down to zero aircraft speed. The engine was aimed at ultraquiet STOL aircraft operating from city-centre airports.

In a bid for increased efficiency with speed, a development of the &quot;turbofan&quot; and &quot;turboprop&quot; known as a propfan engine was created that had an unducted fan. The fan blades are situated outside of the duct, so that it appears like a turboprop with wide scimitar-like blades. Both General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney/Allison demonstrated propfan engines in the 1980s. Excessive cabin noise and relatively cheap jet fuel prevented the engines being put into service. The Progress D-27 propfan, developed in the U.S.S.R., was the only propfan engine equipped on a production aircraft.

==Terminology==
; Afterburner: jetpipe equipped for afterburning
; Augmentor: afterburner for turbofan with burning in hot and cold flows
; Bypass: that part of the engine as distinct from the core in terms of components and airflow, eg that part of fan blading (fan outer) and stators which pass bypass air, bypass duct, bypass nozzle
; Bypass ratio: bypass air mass flow /core air mass flow
; Core: that part of the engine as distinct from the bypass in terms of components and airflow, eg core cowl, core nozzle, core airflow and associated machinery, combustor and fuel system
; Core power: also known as &quot;available energy&quot; or &quot;gas horsepower&quot;. It is used to measure the theoretical (isentropic expansion) shaft work available from a gas generator or core by expanding hot, high pressure gas to ambient pressure. Since the power depends on the pressure and temperature of the gas (and the ambient pressure) a related figure of merit for thrust-producing engines is one which measures the thrust-producing potential from hot, high pressure gas and known as &quot;stream thrust&quot;. It is obtained by calculating the velocity obtained with isentropic expansion to atmospheric pressure. The significance of the thrust obtained appears when multiplied by the aircraft velocity to give the thrust work. The thrust work which is potentially available is far less than the gas horsepower due to the increasing waste in the exhaust kinetic energy with increasing pressure and temperature before expansion to atmospheric pressure. The two are related by the propulsive efficiency, a measure of the energy wasted as a result of producing a force (ie thrust) in a fluid by increasing the speed (ie momentum) of the fluid.
; Dry: engine ratings/ throttle lever positions below afterburning selection
; EGT: exhaust gas temperature
; EPR: engine pressure ratio
; Fan: turbofan LP compressor
; Fanjet: turbofan or aircraft powered by turbofan (colloquial)
; Fan pressure ratio: fan outlet total pressure/fan inlet total pressure
; Flex temp: At reduced take-off weights commercial aircraft can use reduced thrust which increases engine life and reduces maintenance costs. Flex temperature is a higher than actual outside air temperature (OAT) which is input to the engine monitoring computer to achieve the required reduced thrust (also known as &quot;assumed temperature thrust reduction&quot;).
; Gas generator: that part of the engine core which provides the hot, high pressure gas for fan-driving turbines (turbofan), for propelling nozzles (turbojet), for propeller- and rotor-driving turbines (turboprop and turboshaft), for industrial and marine power turbines
; HP: high-pressure
; Intake ram drag: Loss in momentum of engine stream tube from freestream to intake entrance, ie amount of energy imparted to air required to accelerate air from a stationary atmosphere to aircraft speed.
; IEPR: integrated engine pressure ratio
; IP: intermediate pressure
; LP: low-pressure
; Net thrust: nozzle thrust in stationary air (gross thrust) – engine stream tube ram drag (loss in momentum from freestream to intake entrance, ie amount of energy imparted to air required to accelerate air from a stationary atmosphere to aircraft speed). This is the thrust acting on the airframe.
; Overall pressure ratio: amount of times the pressure increases due to ram compression and workndone by the compressor stages
; Overall efficiency: thermal efficiency × propulsive efficiency
; Propulsive efficiency: propulsive power/rate of production of propulsive kinetic energy (maximum propulsive efficiency occurs when jet velocity equals flight velocity, which implies zero net thrust!)
; Specific fuel consumption (SFC): total fuel flow/net thrust (proportional to flight velocity/overall thermal efficiency) 
; Spooling up: increase in RPM (colloquial)
; Spooling down: decrease in RPM (colloquial)
; Stage loading: For a turbine, the purpose of which is to produce power, the loading is an indicator of power developed per lb/sec of gas (specific power). A turbine stage turns the gas from an axial direction and speeds it up (in the nozzle guide vanes) to turn the rotor most effectively ( rotor blades must produce high lift), the proviso being that this is done efficiently, ie with acceptable losses. For a compressor stage, the purpose of which is to produce a pressure rise, a diffusion process is used. How much diffusion may be allowed ( and pressure rise obtained) before unacceptable flow separation occurs (ie losses) may be regarded as a loading limit.
; Stagnation pressure: also known as total pressure; pressure of the fluid if all the kinetic energy were to be converted into pressure isentropically; sum of static pressure and dynamic pressure
; Static pressure: pressure of the fluid which is associated not with its motion but with its state or, alternatively, pressure due to the random motion of the fluid molecules that would be felt or measured if moving with the flow
; Specific thrust: net thrust/intake airflow
; Thermal efficiency: rate of production of propulsive kinetic energy/fuel power
; Total fuel flow: combustor (plus any afterburner) fuel flow rate (e.g., lb/s or g/s)
; Total pressure: also known as stagnation pressure; sum of static pressure and dynamic pressure; pressure of the fluid if all the kinetic energy were to be converted into pressure isentropically
; Turbine rotor inlet temperature: maximum cycle temperature, ie temperature at which work transfer takes place

<text>A theatre director or stage director is a professional in the theatre field who oversees and orchestrates the mounting of a theatre production such as a play, opera, dance, drama, musical theatre performance, etc. by unifying various endeavors and aspects of production. The director&#x27;s function is to ensure the quality and completeness of theatre production and to lead the members of the creative team into realizing their artistic vision for it. The director thereby collaborates with a team of creative individuals and other staff to coordinate research and work on all the aspects of the production which includes the Technical and the Performance aspects.
The technical aspects include: stagecraft, costume design, theatrical properties (props), lighting design, set design, and sound design for the production. The performance aspects include: acting, dance, orchestra, chants, and stage combat.

If the production is a new piece of writing or a (new) translation of a play, the director may also work with the playwright or a translator. In contemporary theatre, after the playwright, the director is generally the principle visionary, making decisions on the artistic conception and interpretation of the play and its staging. Different directors occupy different places of authority and responsibility, depending on the structure and philosophy of individual theatre companies. Directors use a wide variety of techniques, philosophies, and levels of collaboration.

== The director in theatre history ==
In ancient Greece, the birthplace of European drama, the writer bore principal responsibility for the staging of his plays. Actors were generally semi-professionals, and the director oversaw the mounting of plays from the writing process all the way through to their performance, often acting in them too, as Aeschylus for example did. The author-director would also train the chorus, sometimes compose the music, and supervise every aspect of production. The fact that the director was called &quot;didaskalos&quot;, the Greek word for &quot;teacher,&quot; indicates that the work of these early directors combined instructing their performers with staging their work.
In medieval times, the complexity of vernacular religious drama, with its large scale mystery plays that often included crowd scenes, processions and elaborate effects, gave the role of director (or &quot;stage manager&quot; or &quot;pageant master&quot;) considerable importance. A miniature by Jean Fouquet from 1460 (pictured) bears one of the earliest depictions of a director at work. Holding a prompt book, the central figure directs, with the aid of a long stick, the proceedings of the staging of a dramatization of the &quot;Martyrdom of Saint Apollonia&quot;. According to Fouquet, the director&#x27;s tasks included overseeing the erecting of a stage and scenery (there were no permanent, purpose-built theatre structures at this time, and performances of vernacular drama mostly took place in the open air), casting and directing the actors (which included fining them for those that infringed rules), and addressing the audience at the beginning of each performance and after each intermission.

From Renaissance times up until the 19th century, the role of director was often carried by the &quot;actor-manager&quot;. This would usually be a senior actor in a troupe who took the responsibility for choosing the repertoire of work, staging it and managing the company. This was the case for instance with Commedia dell&#x27;Arte companies and English actor-managers like Colley Cibber and David Garrick.
The modern theatre director can be said to have originated in the staging of elaborate spectacles of the Meininger Company under George II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. The management of large numbers of extras and complex stagecraft matters necessitated an individual to take on the role of overall coordinator. This gave rise to the role of the director in modern theatre, and Germany would provide a platform for a generation of emerging visionary theatre directors, such as Erwin Piscator and Max Reinhardt. Simultaneously, Constantin Stanislavski, principally an actor-manager, would set up the Moscow Art Theatre in Russia and similarly emancipate the role of the director as artistic visionary.

The French &quot;regisseur&quot; is also sometimes used to mean a stage director, most commonly in ballet. A more common term for theatre director in French is &quot;metteur en scène&quot;.

Post World War II, the actor-manager slowly started to disappear, and directing become a fully fledged artistic activity within the theatre profession. The director originating artistic vision and concept, and realizing the staging of a production, became the norm rather than the exception. Great forces in the emancipation of theatre directing as a profession were notable 20th-century theatre directors like Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Vsevolod Meyerhold,
Yevgeny Vakhtangov, Michael Chekhov, Yuri Lyubimov (Russia), Orson Welles, Peter Brook, Peter Hall (Britain), Bertolt Brecht (Germany), Giorgio Strehler, and Franco Zeffirelli (Italy).

A cautionary note was introduced by the famed director Sir Tyrone Guthrie who said &quot;the only way to learn how to direct a play, is ... to get a group of actors simple enough to allow you to let you direct them, and direct.&quot;

A number of seminal works on directing and directors include Toby Cole and Helen Krich&#x27;s 1972 &quot;Directors on Directing: A Sourcebook of the Modern Theatre&quot;, Edward Braun&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;The Director and the Stage: From Naturalism to Growtowski&quot;, and Will&#x27;s &quot;The Director in a Changing Theatre&quot; (1976).

== Directing education ==
Because of the relatively late emergence of theatre directing as a performing arts profession when compared with for instance acting or musicianship, a rise of professional vocational training programmes in directing can be seen mostly in the second half of the 20th century. Most European countries nowadays know some form of professional directing training, usually at drama schools or conservatoires, or at universities. In Britain, the tradition that theatre directors emerge from degree courses (usually in English literature) at the Oxbridge universities has meant that for a long time, professional vocational training did not take place at drama schools or performing arts colleges, although an increase in training programmes for theatre directors can be witnessed since the 1970s and 1980s. In American universities, the seminal directing program at the Yale School of Drama produced a number of pioneering directors with D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts) and M.F.A. degrees in Drama (rather than English) who contributed to the expansion of professional resident theaters in the 1960s and 1970s. In the early days such programmes typically led to the staging of one major thesis production in the third (final) year. At the University of California, Irvine, Keith Fowler (a Yale D.F.A. and ex-producer of two LORT companies) led for many years a graduate programme based on the premise that directors are autodidacts who need as many opportunities to direct as possible. Under Fowler, graduate student directors would stage between five and ten productions during their three-year residencies, with each production receiving detailed critiques.

As with many other professions in the performing arts, theatre directors would often learn their skills &quot;on the job&quot;; to this purpose, theatres often employ trainee assistant directors or have in-house education schemes to train young theatre directors. Examples are the Royal National Theatre in London, which frequently organizes short directing courses, or the Orange Tree Theatre and the Donmar Warehouse on London&#x27;s West End, which both employ resident assistant directors on a one-year basis for training purposes.

== Styles of directing ==
Directing is an art form that has grown with the development of theatre theory and theatre practice. With the emergence of new 
trends in theatre, so too have directors adopted new methodologies and engaged in new practices. Interpretation of the drama, by the late twentieth century, had become central to the director&#x27;s work. Relativism and psychoanalytic theory influenced the work of innovative directors such as Peter Brook, Ingmar Bergman, Peter Stein, and Giorgio Strehler.

Kimberly Senior, director of &quot;Disgraced&quot; on Broadway, explains her role as director by saying “I get to take things that were previously in one dimension and put them into three dimensions using my imagination and intellect and people skills.”

Once a show has opened (premiered before a regular audience), theatre directors are generally considered to have fulfilled their function. From that point forward the stage manager is left in charge of all essential concerns.

<doc id="103080" wikidata="Q7438531" url="?curid=103080" title="Scouting in Alabama">
<text>Scouting in Alabama has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910-1950)==
In 1918 a council was formed in Selma, only to be dissolved in 1920. That area would be served later by the Tukabatchee Area Council.

Until 1948, some councils of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) were racially segregated. The National Office began a program of integrating local councils in 1940, which was largely complete in 1948.

==Recent history (1950-1990)==
Circa 1960, the BSA renumbered all local Councils in alphabetical order by state and headquarters city. That numbering system remains in use today. In this sequence, Council &quot;Number 1&quot; (not the &#x27;oldest BSA Council&#x27;) was the Council originally was called the Choccolocco Council that was headquartered in Anniston, Alabama. That Council, combined with two others, now forms the Greater Alabama Council, headquartered from Birmingham, Alabama.

==Scouts BSA in Alabama today==
In the 1990s, the Boy Scouts of America went through a restructuring in an attempt to reduce manpower, and in several states small historic Councils were merged into a larger &quot;supercouncil&quot;. The new Greater Alabama Council is an example of such a supercouncil.
There are eight BSA local councils serving Scouts in Alabama today.

As of Feb 1, 2019, The &quot;Boy Scouts&quot; program under the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) changed its name to &quot;Scouts BSA.&quot; This change was reflective of the organization&#x27;s acceptance of girls as members of the program who wanted to experience the outdoor leadership program enjoyed by boys for over 100 years, including the coveted rank of Eagle Scout.

== Councils ==

===Alabama-Florida Council===

The eponymously named Alabama-Florida Council serves Scouts in Alabama and Florida, with the council office located in Dothan, Alabama. It was founded in 1935 as the Southeast Alabama Council and changed its name in 1963 to its current name.

Camp Westmoreland&#x27;s old Order of the Arrow lodge was once home to Kaskanampo Lodge 310, which merged with Coosa Lodge 50 in the year 1999. Westmoreland District was once a part of the Tennessee Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of America before this council was merged with two other councils to form the Greater Alabama Council. 

Camp Comer is located four miles South of Mentone, Alabama. According to &quot;Mentone Alabama: A History&quot; by Zora Shay Strayhorn:
 &quot;The land was purchased in 1962 and named after Hugh Ross Corner of Sylacauga, a longtime scout worker, who was serving as president of the Choccolocco Council at that time. M. M. Beck, council vice-president, suggested the name.
 In 1965 a fund-raising campaign was successful in developing the lake and camping area. Stumps were removed from the lake and the dam was raised. The lake was named Lake Republic in honor of Republic Steel of Gadsden, a financial supporter of the camp.
 On June 8, 1965, Camp Comer was officially opened. Work continued on the reservation and a year later 3,000 scouts and leaders attended camp.&quot;Camp Sequoyah is nestled among 1,447 acres for woodlands in east central Alabama, near Cheaha State Park.

<text>Comic Relief is a British charity, founded in 1985 by the comedy scriptwriter Richard Curtis and comedian Sir Lenny Henry in response to the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia. The concept of Comic Relief was to get British comedians to make the public laugh, while raising money to help people around the world and in the United Kingdom. A new CEO, Samir Patel, was announced in January 2021.

The highlight of Comic Relief&#x27;s appeal is Red Nose Day, an annual (previously biennial) telethon held in March. The first live fundraising evening, held on 4 April 1986, featured comedians and pop stars, including Rowan Atkinson, Billy Connolly, Stephen Fry, Kate Bush and co-founder Lenny Henry.

A prominent annual event on British television, Comic Relief is one of two high-profile telethon events held in the UK, the other being Children in Need, held annually in November. At the end of the Red Nose Day telethon on 14 March 2015, it was announced that in the 30-year history of Comic Relief, the Red Nose Day and Sport Relief appeals had raised in excess of £1.4 billion.

== Red Nose Day history ==
Comic Relief was launched live on Noel Edmonds&#x27; &quot;Late, Late Breakfast Show&quot; on BBC1, on Christmas Day 1985 from a refugee camp in Sudan. The idea for Comic Relief came from the charity worker Jane Tewson, who established it as the operating name of Charity Projects, a registered charity in England and Scotland.

On 4, 5 and 6 April 1986 the inaugural live fundraising show, &quot;Comic Relief Utterly Utterly Live&quot;, was staged at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London featuring popular alternative comedians and pop stars (including Rowan Atkinson, Billy Connolly, Stephen Fry, Lenny Henry, Kate Bush and Cliff Richard). An audio recording was released on WEA which included a live performance of the charity single &quot;Living Doll&quot; by Cliff Richard and the Young Ones.

The highlight of Comic Relief is Red Nose Day. On 8 February 1988, Lenny Henry went to Ethiopia and celebrated the very first Red Nose Day telethon. Over 150 celebrities and comedians participated. The event raised £15 million and attracted 30 million television viewers on BBC1. To date, Richard Curtis and Lenny Henry are still active participants of the Red Nose Day telethon which continues to raise funds for numerous charities that help children in need and tackle worldwide poverty.

The charity states that its aim is to &quot;bring about positive and lasting change in the lives of poor and disadvantaged people, which we believe requires investing in work that addresses people&#x27;s immediate needs as well as tackling the root causes of poverty and injustice&quot;.

One of the fundamental principles behind working at Comic Relief is the &quot;Golden Pound Principle&quot; where every single donated pound (£) is spent on charitable projects. All operating costs, such as staff salaries, are covered by corporate sponsors, or interest earned on money waiting to be distributed.

Currently, its main supporters are the BBC, BT, TK Maxx and British Airways. The BBC is responsible for the live television extravaganza on &quot;Red Nose Day&quot;; BT provides the telephony, and TK Maxx sells merchandise on behalf of the charity.

Until 2022, Sainsbury&#x27;s sold Red Noses in their Supermarkets, Local Stores and Petrol Stations. 

In 2002, Comic Relief and BBC Sport teamed up to create Sport Relief, a new initiative, aiming to unite the sporting community and culminate in a night of sport, entertainment and fundraising on BBC One. Sport Relief was a biennial charity event, and the campaign deliberately alternated years with Red Nose Day, Comic Relief&#x27;s flagship event. Red Nose Day occurs in odd-numbered years, and Sport Relief in even-numbered years.

In 2009, Comic Relief launched a website calling for a financial transaction tax, the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; tax.

On 14 March 2015, at the end of that year&#x27;s Red Nose Day telethon it was announced that in the 30-year history of Comic Relief, the Red Nose Day and Sport Relief appeals had raised in excess of £1bn (£1,047,083,706).

In 2021 it was announced that Red Nose Day would become an annual event and, starting from 2022, there would be no more Sport Relief telethons. From the same year onwards, the appeal shows of Red Nose Day would now take place at the former Sport Relief studio at Dock10, MediaCityUK in Salford.

In 2024, on Lenny Henry&#x27;s final telethon as a presenter, he revealed that the overall £1 billion announced in 2015 had risen to over £1.6 billion (£1,602,539,154).

==On television==
The television programming begins in the afternoon, with CBBC having various related reports, money raising events and celebrity gunging. This is all in-between the regular programmes, but after the six o&#x27;clock news, the normal BBC One schedule is suspended at 7 pm in favour of a live show, with a break at 10 pm for the regular news programme. Whilst the BBC News at Ten is aired on BBC One, Comic Relief continues on BBC Two, and then resumes on BBC One at 10:35 pm, with each hour overseen by a different celebrity team. These celebrities do the work for free, as do the crew, with studio space and production facilities donated by the BBC.

Regular themes throughout the shows include parodies of recent popular shows, films and clips, events, and specially filmed versions of comedy shows. &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;, and a parody sketch starring Rowan Atkinson were both regularly featured.

In addition to the continued absence of Rowan Atkinson, two more prominent supporters of the charity were absent for 2011 – this was the first ever Comic Relief event to feature no input from Dawn French, and the first for over 10 years to not feature input from Matt Lucas.

Footage of the latter challenge, which took place between the Aquatics Centre in London and Plymouth, was featured in a BBC One documentary called &quot;Tom Daley&#x27;s Hell of a Homecoming&quot; which was broadcast on 14 March 2022.

The main Red Nose Day programming was split into three sections with the three-hour comedy special and &quot;The Great Comic Relief Prizeathon&quot; appearing on BBC One before and after the news, whilst &quot;Comic Relief at the Movies&quot; took a 10pm slot on BBC Two.

The 2022 Comic Relief show featured parodies of &quot;The Repair Shop&quot; (with Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and Dame Judi Dench) as well as various popstars in David Walliams and Matt Lucas&#x27; &quot;Rock Profile&quot; sketches, whilst Tim Vine and Kiri Pritchard-McLean took part in a &quot;One Man and His Dog&quot; competition.

The event raised £38 million from donations.

===2025 event===

==Ratings==
==Fundraising==
* Including only funds raised during the telethon
* Including money raised by Sport Relief

==Merchandise==

Various items of merchandise have been sold to promote and raise money for Comic Relief. In 1991, &quot;The Totally Stonking, Surprisingly Educational And Utterly Mindboggling Comic Relief Comic&quot; was published by Fleetway. Conceived, plotted and edited by Neil Gaiman, Richard Curtis, Grant Morrison and Peter K. Hogan, it featured contributions from a vast array of British comics talent, including Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, Dave Gibbons, Mark Millar, Simon Bisley, Mark Buckingham, Steve Dillon, D&#x27;Israeli, Jamie Hewlett and Bryan Talbot. (Alan Moore, arguably Britain&#x27;s most famous comics writer, was not credited as working on the book having sworn never to work for Fleetway again, but was said to have worked with partner Melinda Gebbie on her pages.) The comic was unique in that it featured appearances by characters from across the spectrum of comics publishers, including Marvel and DC superheroes, &quot;Beano&quot;, &quot;Dandy&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Viz&quot; characters, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, in addition to a cavalcade of British comedy figures (both real and fictional). These were all linked by the twin framing narratives of the Comic Relief night itself, and the tale of &quot;Britain&#x27;s meanest man&quot; Sir Edmund Blackadder being persuaded to donate money to the event. The comic &quot;sold out in minutes&quot;, raising over £40,000 for the charity, and is now a highly prized collectors&#x27; item. Comic Relief have also sold Fairtrade Cotton Socks from a number of vendors. This is mainly for their Sport Relief charity.

In 1993 a computer platform game was released, called &quot;Sleepwalker&quot;. The game featured voice overs from Lenny Henry and Harry Enfield, and several other references to Comic Relief and tomatoes; the theme for the 1993 campaign.

In 2001 J. K. Rowling wrote two books for Comic Relief based on her famous Harry Potter series, entitled &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; and &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot;. The Fantastic Beasts book, would ultimately lead to the mid-late 2010s series of films of the same name as part of the expanded &quot;Potterverse&quot;.

In 2007, Walkers complemented the usual merchandise by adding their own take on the red nose, promoting red ears instead. The large ears, dubbed &#x27;Walk-ears&#x27;, are based on a very old joke involving the actual ears of ex-footballer Gary Lineker, who has fronted their ad campaign since the early 1990s. Walkers previously promoted the charity in 2005, making four limited edition unusual crisp flavours.

The 2007 game for Red Nose Day, &quot;Let It Flow&quot;, could be played online. This game was developed by Matmi, worldwide viral marketeers, and set in the African wilderness. Mischievous hyenas had messed up the water irrigation system which fed the crops. You had to help re-arrange the pipes to let the water flow to the crops to keep them alive. Once the pipes were arranged, you needed to operate the elephant&#x27;s trunk to pump the water through the water pipes.

For the 2007 campaign Andrex, known for their ad campaign fronted by a Labrador puppy, gave away toy puppies with red noses.

As a Supporting Partner Jackpotjoy has launched two Red Nose Day Games for Red Nose Day 2011.

===Red nose===
The most prominent symbol of Comic Relief is a &quot;red nose&quot;, which is given in various supermarkets and charity shops such as Oxfam in exchange for a donation to the charity and to make others laugh. People are encouraged to wear the noses on Red Nose Day to help raise awareness of the charity. The design of the nose has been changed each year, beginning with a fairly plain one, which later grew arms, turned into a tomato and even changed colour. This regular re-design was in part to stop people from re-using previous years designs, and having to buy the latest version, as for example some people may re-use the same Poppy, repeatedly, rather than buying a new one each year. In 2007, the red nose was made of foam; this was to facilitate the &quot;growing&quot; of the nose (by rolling it in the user&#x27;s hands) to keep in line with that year&#x27;s tagline, &quot;The Big One&quot; (see the table below). Larger noses are also available and are designed to be attached to the fronts of cars, buildings and, in 2009, a diameter inflatable nose was attached to the DFDS Seaways cruiseferry &quot;King of Scandinavia&quot;. However, the nose&#x27;s material used for buildings was classed as a fire hazard and was banned from the &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot; shows.

====Chronology of noses====
, Comic Relief has sold 50 different red noses over 19 Red Nose Days. In 1988, It started with one nose. Two noses were available for the 1995 event. Three noses per event were available from 2009 to 2013. In 2015, nine noses were released, and in 2017, there were 10 different noses available—for both these years, this included a rare collector&#x27;s nose. For 2019, 11 different noses were available to buy, including &quot;rare&quot; and &quot;ultra-rare&quot; noses. Ten different plastic-free noses were available for Red Nose Day 2021. In 2022, There were 8 noses. In 2023, It went back to only one. In 2024, there were four plastic noses, including the golden &quot;rare&quot; nose. In 2025, 6 noses were made to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Red Nose Day. 4 noses from past Comic Relief campaigns (1988,1991,2009 and 2013) to celebrate 4 decades of Comic Relief, alongside a cupcake nose exclusive to the collector’s pack, and a rare ruby red nose. All noses also returned to their foam design for the first time since 2019.
====Chronology of car noses====
A selection of Red Nose Day &quot;car noses&quot; have been produced over the years, to show support for the charity while out on the road. They have traditionally been a curved nose which attaches to the car&#x27;s radiator grille. In 2009, this was replaced with a magnetic design owing to safety concerns. The original grill-attachable design returned for 2011, for the first time since 1999.

2014 saw the new release of 2 Flip Flap noses, the Poppy and England flag red nose designs and the first paper noses for cars and the 1st year for 2 car noses.

==Charity singles==
In April 1986, the first Comic Relief charity record was released. It featured Cliff Richard and the cast of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; in a rendition of Richard&#x27;s late 50s hit &quot;Living Doll&quot;.

Some of the money raised from the sale of each single is donated to Comic Relief. Normally, a song is released just before the official Red Nose Day. There have been exceptions, such as &quot;(I Want To Be) Elected&quot; which was released to coincide with the 1992 UK general election. Before the single released in 1995, Comic Relief records were all more-or-less comedy releases, mostly involving an actual band or singer teamed up with a comedy group. From 1995 on, they have been generally more serious, although the promo videos still feature comical moments.

2003 saw a return to the format of old. From 2005 to 2011, two Comic Relief singles were released each Red Nose Day, a song by a mainstream artist and also a comedy song.

In 1991, a music video was created called &quot;Helping Hands&quot;, which included numerous children&#x27;s television puppet personalities, including characters from &quot;The House of Gristle&quot;, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, &quot;Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Roland Rat&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, &quot;Round the Bend!&quot;, &quot;Bill &amp; Ben&quot;, &quot;The Gophers&quot;, &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Tale of the Bunny Picnic&quot; and more. In 1993 a follow-up single happened, this time featuring the biggest stars of children&#x27;s television at the time called &quot;You Can Be a Hero&quot;. Neither song was ever released.

The biggest-selling Comic Relief single is Tony Christie and Peter Kay&#x27;s &quot;Is This the Way to Amarillo&quot;, with 1.28 million copies sold. Westlife&#x27;s 2001 cover of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Uptown Girl&quot; is the second biggest-seller, followed by 1986&#x27;s &quot;Living Doll&quot; and the Spice Girls&#x27; 1997 double-A side single &quot;Mama&quot;/&quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, with Boyzone&#x27;s 1999 cover of &quot;When the Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going&quot; rounding up the top five.
* Even though &quot;Living Doll&quot; is a song featuring the cast of &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, this does not include Alexei Sayle
* This was a double-A side single, even though the Official Charts Company only credit one side with the hit
* &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; is the Comic Relief side
* On this release, comedians only appear in the video
* &quot;Is This the Way to Amarillo&quot;, though released expressly with the intent of proceeds going to Comic Relief, was not an official Comic Relief single. The song was originally performed by Peter Kay (lip-synching to the voice Tony Christie) during the evening, and was later released as a single. It was No. 1 in the UK charts for seven weeks, and in its first week, it outsold the rest of the Top 20 combined.
* In 2007, a version of The Proclaimers&#x27; song &quot;500 Miles&quot;, released on 19 March, featured Peter Kay and Matt Lucas as their respective wheelchair-using characters Brian Potter and Andy Pipkin. Before its official release, the song reached No. 3 based on downloads alone. The single itself reached No. 1 on 25 March, knocking official Comic Relief single &quot;Walk This Way&quot; off the top spot.
* In 2009, the comedy release took prominence over the single release by a mainstream recording artist. Gavin &amp; Stacey&#x27;s Ruth Jones and Rob Brydon covered &quot;Islands in The Stream&quot; for the event, with this being released on the week of Comic Relief. The Saturdays had released their record a week earlier.
* &quot;Gold Forever&quot; is the lead single from The Wanted&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Battleground&quot;. It is also a promo single on their 2012 American debut, &quot;The Wanted EP&quot;.
* This was listed as a separate hit with the original version of &quot;Lay Me Down&quot; peaking at number 15.

In addition, the first Red Nose Day schools&#x27; song (&quot;Make Someone Happy&quot;) was published in 2007. A CD of the song, together with backing tracks and fundraising ideas, was sent free of charge to all primary schools in the UK – during February – by the education music publisher &#x27;Out of the Ark Music&#x27;. Schools would be free to use the song in assemblies, singathons, or other fundraising activities. A second Red Nose Day Song has been released for every school in the UK, to use free of charge. It can be downloaded from the Red Nose Day 09 website, or watched on YouTube, and a copy has been sent to every primary school in the UK. It was again published by &#x27;Out of the Ark&#x27; music, and contained a more upbeat melody than the version released in 2007. It was recorded at Hook Studios, Hook, Surrey, by the Out of the Ark Choir, which is completely made up of children. The children in the video wear Stella McCartney&#x27;s special edition Comic Relief T-shirts, and was filmed in black and white so that only the red stood out.

==Criticism==
There has been some concern about the lack of gender equality in the causes supported by Comic Relief, with much funding going to politicised women&#x27;s charities or charities focusing on women. Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Ross Clark raised the question, &#x27;Why do all these women&#x27;s charities...feel the need to disguise their fundraising in the prat-fest that is Comic Relief, rather than appealing directly to the public?&#x27; He added, &#x27;Are they worried that if the British public realised where their money was going, they would be less inclined to be so generous?&#x27;

The British Stammering Association criticised comedian Lenny Henry over his opening sketch for the 2011 telethon, during which he spoofed the film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; and grew impatient with Colin Firth in his portrayal of King George VI as he stammered over his speech. &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that the British Stammering Association had branded the sketch as &#x27;a gross and disgusting gleefulness at pointing out someone else&#x27;s misfortune&#x27;.

In December 2013, an edition of the BBC One series &quot;Panorama&quot; pointed out that between 2007 and 2009, millions of pounds donated to Comic Relief had been invested in funds which appeared &#x27;to contradict several of its core aims&#x27;, with shares in tobacco, alcohol and arms firms.

The 2017 event was strongly criticised by viewers for various technical issues, glitches and having two adult-orientated skits shown before the 9 pm watershed, one where Vic Reeves showed a fake penis to &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; presenter Susanna Reid, and another featuring a scene in which presenter Graham Norton asks model Cara Delevingne why she had sex on a plane. The event was also criticised for two pre-watershed instances of profanity, one involving a Mrs. Brown&#x27;s Boys skit where the titular character does a V sign (a gesture that is deemed profane in the United Kingdom), and another involving Russell Brand after a technical blunder caused him to swear and say &quot;Fuck&quot; after being cut off. In total 338 complaints were made to Ofcom, however the regulator chose not to investigate because the comedy sketches &quot;were inexplicit and consistent with the live, unpredictable format of this established charity programme&quot;, whilst recognising that some &quot;were not to everyone&#x27;s taste&quot;.

In 2017, a video featuring Ed Sheeran meeting and rescuing a child in Liberia for Comic Relief was criticised as &#x27;poverty porn&#x27; and was given the &#x27;Rusty Radiator&#x27; award for the &#x27;most offensive and stereotypical fundraising video of the year&#x27;.

Writing in The Guardian in 2017, Labour MP David Lammy argued that Comic Relief perpetuated problematic stereotypes of Africa, and that they had a responsibility to use its powerful position to move the debate on in a more constructive way by establishing an image of African people as equals.

In 2018, in response to Lammy&#x27;s comments and the backlash to Sheeran&#x27;s video, Comic Relief announced they would take steps towards change by halting their use of celebrities for appeals.

However, in February 2019, Lammy also criticised Stacey Dooley for posting on social media about her trip to Uganda for Comic Relief, saying that &#x27;the world does not need any more white saviours&#x27;, and that she was perpetuating &#x27;tired and unhelpful stereotypes&#x27; about Africa. The pressure group &#x27;No White Saviours&#x27; argued that Comic Relief had pledged to make changes to their celebrity campaigns in the past, and now needed to put them into practice.

The remarks by Lammy were believed to have damaged coverage of Red Nose Day; viewership dropped and the donations received for the broadcast in March 2019 fell by £8 million and the money raised that year was the lowest since 2007. In 2020, as a result of Lammy&#x27;s intervention, Comic Relief announced that it would no longer send celebrities to Africa nor portray Africa with images of starving people or critically ill children. Instead, they would be using local film makers to provide a more &quot;authentic&quot; perspective and give agency back to African people.

==Similar events outside the United Kingdom==

* United States: In 2015, Red Nose Day was formally brought to the United States under the auspices of Comic Relief, Inc., an organisation unrelated to the defunct Comic Relief USA. The 2015 &quot;Red Nose Day Special&quot; aired on NBC on 21 May 2015 and was hosted by David Duchovny, Seth Meyers and Jane Krakowski, raising $23 million. The 2016 NBC special aired on 26 May with Craig Ferguson as the host. Sponsored by Walgreens, Red Nose Day has since become an annual event.
* Inspired by the British charity, a United States Comic Relief charity was founded in 1986 by Bob Zmuda. Comic Relief was an irregularly held event, televised on Home Box Office (HBO), which has raised and distributed nearly US$50 million towards providing health care services to homeless people throughout the United States. Comedians Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg were hosts of the event. The 1989 HBO Comic Relief show debuted the song &quot;Mr. President&quot;, written by Joe Sterling, Ray Reach and Mike Loveless. The song was sung by Al Jarreau and Natalie Cole. On 18 November 2006, the event was revived as a fundraiser for those affected by Hurricane Katrina, and was simulcast on TBS. Richard Curtis also created the Idol Gives Back special for &quot;American Idol&quot;, which follows the same basic premise as Comic Relief, with specially filmed shorts, performances and footage of the stars of the show visiting impoverished countries.
* Australia: In 1988, the Red Nose Day concept was adopted by the SIDS and Kids organisation to help raise funds for research into sudden infant death syndrome. Since then, Red Nose Day in Australia is held annually on the last Friday of June. An Australian version of Comic Relief, Comic Relief Australia, has also been set up. Following a campaign encouraging people to buy articles such as red wristbands, the first telethon-style event was held on 6 November 2005 on the Seven Network. It followed the established format, with comedy interspersed with examples of the sorts of charities to benefit. According to its website, this raised over A$800,000. Another telethon was broadcast on 27 November 2006 on Seven Network. The 2006 Comic Relief Show was held under the title &#x27;50 Years of Laughs&#x27; celebrating 50 years of Television in Australia. It was hosted by Colin Lane, and featured presenters such as Amanda Keller, Mikey Robins, Ugly Dave Gray and Derryn Hinch interviewing Kylie Mole.
* Germany: The German TV station Pro 7 initiated a similar event in 2003. By selling red noses, money is collected for the charity foundations PowerChild, &quot;Deutsche Kinder- und Jugendstiftung&quot; (lit., German Child and Youth Foundation), and Comic Relief. The event is called &#x27;Red Nose Day&#x27;, and took place annually in March or April from 2003 to 2006. However, ratings and the collected donations fell far short of expectations in 2006, resulting in no main show being produced in 2007 and 2008. In 2003, Nena (who is famous for her hit song 99 Red Balloons) released an updated version of her song Wunder Gescheh&#x27;n (Miracles Happen) for the charity. In 2010, the Red Nose Day returned on Pro7. It took place on 25 November.
* Russia: A similar charity campaign, entitled &quot;Red Nose, Kind Heart&quot;, was launched in Russia on 1 April 2007. The main goal of the drive, held between 1 April and 19 May 2007 by the Liniya Zhizni (Life Line) foundation, is raising money to help children afflicted with serious diseases (such as heart diseases).
* Finland: In 2002, the Finnish national broadcaster YLE started an annual charity event, which initially went under the title &quot;Ylen hyvä&quot;. In 2007, the event adopted the name &quot;Nenäpäivä&quot; (Nose day), and the use of red noses to more closely follow the example of the British event.
* Iceland: &quot;Dagur rauða nefsins&quot; (Red Nose Day) has been held in support of UNICEF since 2006. It has featured the sale of red noses to raise funds and has enjoyed support and publicity from many local celebrities and televised events on the national broadcaster, RÚV.
* Belgium: &quot;Rodeneuzendag&quot; (Red Nose Day) was held in Belgium for the first time in 2015 to raise money for children with psychiatric problems, and aired on VTM.
* Ireland: RTÉ Does Comic Relief was launched in June 2020, to raise funds for charities and local community initiatives within Ireland. The event took place to raise funds that were lost during the COVID-19 pandemic with all proceeds going to The Community Foundation for Ireland who will distribute the funds raised to over 4,000 non-profit organisations at a national, regional, and local level throughout Ireland. The event was broadcast live on RTÉ One and the RTÉ Player for over 4 hours on Friday, 26 June 2020 raising millions of euro for local charities with appearances by Paul Mescal, Aisling Bea, Hozier, Roy Keane, Westlife, Samantha Mumba, Amy Huberman and a host of other Irish and international celebrities, comedians, actors, and musicians. The event was hosted by Deirdre O&#x27;Kane, Nicky Byrne, Baz Ashmawy, Jennifer Zamparelli, and Eoghan McDermott. During the live event the Government of Ireland issued a statement stating it would match all proceeds donated by doubling the amount and a number of Irish and international companies also donated large sums of money to the fund.

<doc id="103088" wikidata="Q497027" url="?curid=103088" title="Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid">
<text>Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid is a 1982 American neo-noir mystery comedy film directed, co-written by, and co-starring Carl Reiner and co-written by and starring Steve Martin. Co-starring Rachel Ward, the film is both a parody of and a homage to film noir and the pulp detective films of the 1940s. The title refers to Martin&#x27;s character telling a story about a woman obsessed with plaid in a scene that was ultimately cut from the film.

Edited by Bud Molin, &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; is partly a collage film, incorporating clips from 19 vintage films. They are combined with new footage of Martin and other actors similarly shot in black-and-white, with the result that the original dialogue and acting of the classic films become part of a completely different story.

Among the actors who appear from classic films are Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Brian Donlevy, Kirk Douglas, Ava Gardner, Cary Grant, Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Burt Lancaster, Charles Laughton, Fred MacMurray, Ray Milland, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Vincent Price, Barbara Stanwyck, and Lana Turner.

This was the last film for both costume designer Edith Head and composer Miklós Rózsa.

==Plot==
Juliet Forrest, daughter of scientist and cheesemaker John Forrest, asks private investigator Rigby Reardon to investigate her father&#x27;s death. Searching Dr. Forrest&#x27;s lab, Rigby finds two lists, &quot;Friends of Carlotta&quot; (FOC) and &quot;Enemies of Carlotta&quot; (EOC), and an autographed photo of singer Kitty Collins, whose name appears on one of the lists. A man shoots Rigby in the arm and takes the lists.

Rigby finds his way to Juliet&#x27;s house, where she sucks out the bullet. Juliet also reveals a note to her father from her brother-in-law, Sam Hastings, which reveals that Dr. Forrest gave Sam a dollar bill &quot;for safekeeping&quot;. When Juliet mentions her cleaning woman, Rigby goes berserk due to his father running off with his cleaning woman and Rigby&#x27;s mother dying of a broken heart.

Rigby tracks down Sam and gets Dr. Forrest&#x27;s dollar, which has FOC names scrawled on it — including Kitty and her boyfriend Swede Anderson. Rigby tracks down Kitty, asking her whether she is one of Carlotta&#x27;s friends, which causes her to leave. He trails her to a restaurant, where she ditches her brooch into her soup. Rigby retrieves the brooch, which contains an EOC list on which all names are crossed out except Swede Anderson&#x27;s. Rigby visits Swede, but Swede is killed. Rigby is shot in the same arm as before, requiring Juliet to suck out another bullet. Rigby calls his mentor Philip Marlowe for assistance. Juliet hands over a key from Dr. Forrest&#x27;s desk and a key to train station locker 1936. Marlowe picks up the EOC list to check for unsolved murders.

Rigby goes to the train station locker, which contains more lists. He finds F.X. Huberman, whose name was on one of the lists, throwing a party. She flirts with Rigby, then drugs his drink and steals the locker key. Juliet finds Rigby and informs him that Sam fell from a window reaching for a bottle of whiskey. She has an article from &quot;The New York Times&quot; about a cruise ship called &quot;Immer Essen&quot;; Sam Hastings was a passenger. When Marlowe calls, Rigby questions him about Walter Neff, the ship&#x27;s owner, and learns that Neff cruises supermarkets for blondes.

Rigby disguises himself as a blonde and meets Neff. Rigby drugs him and finds a passenger manifest for the &quot;Immer Essen&quot; identical to an EOC list and articles about the ship&#x27;s imprisoned captain, Cody Jarrett, who refuses to talk to anyone but his mother. Rigby dresses up as Jarrett&#x27;s mother to visit Jarrett. He tries winning Jarrett&#x27;s confidence, explaining that the FOC are after him. When that fails, Rigby impersonates a prisoner. Jarrett turns out to be a FOC and shoots Rigby.

After sucking out a third bullet, Juliet leaves for the drugstore. Marlowe informs Rigby that Carlotta is an island off Peru. At a cafe, Rigby finds Kitty. Carlos, a policeman, warns Rigby of the locals, including Kitty&#x27;s new boyfriend, Rice. The next day, one of the locals approaches Rigby and tries to bribe him into leaving the island.

Kitty drops by Rigby&#x27;s room. Carlos is telling him Rice is in town with a group of Germans when the telephone line is cut. Kitty drugs Rigby&#x27;s drink, and he wakes up to find Rice choking him. After a chase, Rigby shoots Rice and frisks the corpse, leading him to a hideout where he finds Juliet, her father still alive, and her butler, Field Marshal Wilfried von Kluck.

Dr. Forrest divulged a secret cheese mold to Nazis posing as a humanitarian organization. Once he discovered their intention to use the mold&#x27;s corrosive properties to destroy America with strategically placed cheese bombs, he assembled a list of Nazi agents, the FOC. Before he could divulge the names to the FBI, he was abducted and his death faked to prevent a police investigation. The &quot;Immer Essen&quot;, a cruise ship passing by, witnessed the mold tests, making all passengers EOC. Rigby is captured but Juliet gets Wilfried to say &quot;cleaning woman&quot;, causing Rigby to go berserk, break his chains and overpower the Nazis. While Juliet gets Rodriguez, Wilfried pulls one of the switches, destroying Terre Haute, Indiana, before being killed by Rigby. Rodriguez rounds up the other Nazis while Rigby shares a kiss with Juliet.

=== Archive footage (in order of appearance) ===
== Production ==
In mid-1980, comedian Steve Martin was having lunch with director Carl Reiner and screenwriter George Gipe. They were also discussing a screenplay Martin had written when he suggested that they use a clip from an old film. From this suggestion came the idea of using all sorts of clips from films throughout the entire feature. The three men left the lunch thinking about how they could incorporate all of these old clips into a story. Reiner planned to work Martin into the old footage via over-the-shoulder shots so that it looked like the comedian was talking to these vintage actors, a strategy used effectively several times in the film. In one scene, trick photography makes it appear that Martin is in the same shot (not over-the-shoulder) as Cary Grant in a clip from &quot;Suspicion&quot;. Reiner and Gipe spent countless hours looking through classic films for specific shots and &quot;listening for a line that was ambiguous enough but had enough meat in it to contribute a line&quot;. They took lines of dialogue from clips they wanted to use and juxtaposed them while also trying to write a story based on them. Reiner and Gipe finally worked out a story and then met with Martin, who contributed some funny material of his own.

Martin purposely chose not to watch any classic films noir because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to act like Humphrey Bogart … I didn&#x27;t want to be influenced&quot;. The filmmakers enlisted some of the people that helped define many of the classic films from the 1940s. Costume designer Edith Head created over 20 suits for Martin in similar fashion to those worn by Cary Grant and James Stewart. Production designer John DeCuir, a veteran with 40 years of experience, designed 85 sets for the ten-week shooting schedule. Director of photography Michael Chapman studied the angles and lighting popular among &#x27;40s film noir, conducting six months of research with Technicolor to try to match the old film clips with his new footage.

Principal photography began on July 7, 1981, with the bulk of the shooting done on soundstages of Laird International Studios in Culver City and three exterior locations shot in and around Los Angeles. Martin usually acted opposite actors dressed exactly like the classic movie stars he was interacting with so that he had someone he could talk to and who would respond to his lines.

Edith Head died two weeks after finishing her work on this film. A dedication honoring her appears before the film&#x27;s end credits.

==Critical reception==
Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 77% based on reviews from 26 critics with the consensus: &quot;&quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; is more elaborate pastiche than uproarious comedy, but the farce works thanks to the sly lampooning of Hollywood noir and Steve Martin&#x27;s performance as a goofy gumshoe.&quot; The film received a rating of 64 on Metacritic.

In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, David Ansen wrote, &quot;A one joke movie? Perhaps, but it&#x27;s such an engaging joke that anyone who loves old movies will find it irresistible. And anyone who loves Steve Martin will be fascinated by his sly performance, which is pitched exactly between the low comedy of &quot;The Jerk&quot; and the highbrow Brechtianisms of &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;.&quot; Vincent Canby&#x27;s review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Martin&#x27;s performance: &quot;the film has an actor who&#x27;s one of America&#x27;s best sketch artists, a man blessed with a great sense of timing, who is also self-effacing enough to meet the most cockeyed demands of the material.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;The gag works for a while, as Martin weaves his own plot-web into the 18 old movies, but pretty soon he&#x27;s traveling on old good will and flop sweat.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, in particular abstract algebra, a graded ring is a ring such that the underlying additive group is a direct sum of abelian groups formula_1 such that . The index set is usually the set of nonnegative integers or the set of integers, but can be any monoid. The direct sum decomposition is usually referred to as gradation or grading.

A graded module is defined similarly (see below for the precise definition). It generalizes graded vector spaces. A graded module that is also a graded ring is called a graded algebra. A graded ring could also be viewed as a graded -algebra.

The associativity is not important (in fact not used at all) in the definition of a graded ring; hence, the notion applies to non-associative algebras as well; e.g., one can consider a graded Lie algebra.

== First properties ==
Generally, the index set of a graded ring is assumed to be the set of nonnegative integers, unless otherwise explicitly specified. This is the case in this article.

A graded ring is a ring that is decomposed into a direct sum
: formula_2 
of 
additive groups, such that 
: formula_3
for all nonnegative integers formula_4 and .

A nonzero element of formula_5 is said to be &quot;homogeneous&quot; of &quot;degree&quot; . By definition of a direct sum, every nonzero element formula_6 of formula_7 can be uniquely written as a sum formula_8 where each formula_9 is either 0 or homogeneous of degree . The nonzero formula_9 are the &quot;homogeneous components&quot; of .

Some basic properties are:
* formula_11 is a subring of ; in particular, the multiplicative identity formula_12 is a homogeneous element of degree zero.
* For any formula_13, formula_5 is a two-sided -module, and the direct sum decomposition is a direct sum of -modules.
* formula_7 is an associative -algebra.

An ideal formula_16 is &quot;homogeneous&quot;, if for every , the homogeneous components of formula_6 also belong to . (Equivalently, if it is a graded submodule of ; see .) The intersection of a homogeneous ideal formula_18 with formula_5 is an -submodule of formula_5 called the &quot;homogeneous part&quot; of degree formula_13 of . A homogeneous ideal is the direct sum of its homogeneous parts.

If formula_18 is a two-sided homogeneous ideal in , then formula_23 is also a graded ring, decomposed as
: formula_24
where formula_25 is the homogeneous part of degree formula_13 of .

== Basic examples ==
* Any (non-graded) ring &quot;R&quot; can be given a gradation by letting , and formula_27 for &quot;i&quot; ≠ 0. This is called the trivial gradation on &quot;R&quot;.
* The polynomial ring formula_28 is graded by degree: it is a direct sum of formula_1 consisting of homogeneous polynomials of degree &quot;i&quot;.
* Let &quot;S&quot; be the set of all nonzero homogeneous elements in a graded integral domain &quot;R&quot;. Then the localization of &quot;R&quot; with respect to &quot;S&quot; is a formula_30-graded ring.
* If &quot;I&quot; is an ideal in a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, then formula_31 is a graded ring called the associated graded ring of &quot;R&quot; along &quot;I&quot;; geometrically, it is the coordinate ring of the normal cone along the subvariety defined by &quot;I&quot;.
* Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space, &quot;H&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;; &quot;R&quot;) the &quot;i&quot;th cohomology group with coefficients in a ring &quot;R&quot;. Then &quot;H&quot; *(&quot;X&quot;; &quot;R&quot;), the cohomology ring of &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in &quot;R&quot;, is a graded ring whose underlying group is formula_32 with the multiplicative structure given by the cup product.

== Graded module ==
The corresponding idea in module theory is that of a graded module, namely a left module &quot;M&quot; over a graded ring &quot;R&quot; such that
: formula_33
and
: formula_34
for every and .

Examples:
* A graded vector space is an example of a graded module over a field (with the field having trivial grading).
* A graded ring is a graded module over itself. An ideal in a graded ring is homogeneous if and only if it is a graded submodule. The annihilator of a graded module is a homogeneous ideal.
* Given an ideal &quot;I&quot; in a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, the direct sum formula_35 is a graded module over the associated graded ring formula_36.

A &quot;morphism&quot; formula_37 of graded modules, called a graded morphism or &quot;graded homomorphism&quot; , is a homomorphism of the underlying modules that respects grading; i.e., . A graded submodule is a submodule that is a graded module in own right and such that the set-theoretic inclusion is a morphism of graded modules. Explicitly, a graded module &quot;N&quot; is a graded submodule of &quot;M&quot; if and only if it is a submodule of &quot;M&quot; and satisfies . The kernel and the image of a morphism of graded modules are graded submodules.

Remark: To give a graded morphism from a graded ring to another graded ring with the image lying in the center is the same as to give the structure of a graded algebra to the latter ring.

Given a graded module formula_38, the formula_39-twist of formula_38 is a graded module defined by formula_41 (cf. Serre&#x27;s twisting sheaf in algebraic geometry).

Let &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; be graded modules. If formula_42 is a morphism of modules, then &quot;f&quot; is said to have degree &quot;d&quot; if formula_43. An exterior derivative of differential forms in differential geometry is an example of such a morphism having degree 1.

== Invariants of graded modules ==

Given a graded module &quot;M&quot; over a commutative graded ring &quot;R&quot;, one can associate the formal power series :
: formula_44
(assuming formula_45 are finite.) It is called the Hilbert–Poincaré series of &quot;M&quot;.

A graded module is said to be finitely generated if the underlying module is finitely generated. The generators may be taken to be homogeneous (by replacing the generators by their homogeneous parts.)

Suppose &quot;R&quot; is a polynomial ring , &quot;k&quot; a field, and &quot;M&quot; a finitely generated graded module over it. Then the function formula_46 is called the Hilbert function of &quot;M&quot;. The function coincides with the integer-valued polynomial for large &quot;n&quot; called the Hilbert polynomial of &quot;M&quot;.

== Graded algebra ==

An associative algebra &quot;A&quot; over a ring &quot;R&quot; is a graded algebra if it is graded as a ring.

In the usual case where the ring &quot;R&quot; is not graded (in particular if &quot;R&quot; is a field), it is given the trivial grading (every element of &quot;R&quot; is of degree 0). Thus, formula_47 and the graded pieces formula_48 are &quot;R&quot;-modules.

In the case where the ring &quot;R&quot; is also a graded ring, then one requires that 
: formula_49

In other words, we require &quot;A&quot; to be a graded left module over &quot;R&quot;.

Examples of graded algebras are common in mathematics:
* Polynomial rings. The homogeneous elements of degree &quot;n&quot; are exactly the homogeneous polynomials of degree &quot;n&quot;.
* The tensor algebra formula_50 of a vector space &quot;V&quot;. The homogeneous elements of degree &quot;n&quot; are the tensors of order &quot;n&quot;, .
* The exterior algebra formula_51 and the symmetric algebra formula_52 are also graded algebras.
* The cohomology ring formula_53 in any cohomology theory is also graded, being the direct sum of the cohomology groups .

Graded algebras are much used in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and algebraic topology. One example is the close relationship between homogeneous polynomials and projective varieties (cf. Homogeneous coordinate ring.)

== &quot;G&quot;-graded rings and algebras ==
The above definitions have been generalized to rings graded using any monoid &quot;G&quot; as an index set. A &quot;G&quot;-graded ring &quot;R&quot; is a ring with a direct sum decomposition
: formula_54
such that
: formula_55
Elements of &quot;R&quot; that lie inside formula_1 for some formula_57 are said to be homogeneous of grade &quot;i&quot;.

The previously defined notion of &quot;graded ring&quot; now becomes the same thing as an formula_58-graded ring, where formula_58 is the monoid of natural numbers under addition. The definitions for graded modules and algebras can also be extended this way replacing the indexing set formula_58 with any monoid &quot;G&quot;.

Remarks:
* If we do not require that the ring have an identity element, semigroups may replace monoids.

Examples:
* A group naturally grades the corresponding group ring; similarly, monoid rings are graded by the corresponding monoid.
* An (associative) superalgebra is another term for a formula_61-graded algebra. Examples include Clifford algebras. Here the homogeneous elements are either of degree 0 (even) or 1 (odd).

=== Anticommutativity ===
Some graded rings (or algebras) are endowed with an anticommutative structure. This notion requires a homomorphism of the monoid of the gradation into the additive monoid of formula_62, the field with two elements. Specifically, a signed monoid consists of a pair formula_63 where formula_64 is a monoid and formula_65 is a homomorphism of additive monoids. An anticommutative formula_64-graded ring is a ring &quot;A&quot; graded with respect to formula_64 such that:
: formula_68
for all homogeneous elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

=== Examples ===
* An exterior algebra is an example of an anticommutative algebra, graded with respect to the structure formula_69 where formula_70 is the quotient map.
* A supercommutative algebra (sometimes called a skew-commutative associative ring) is the same thing as an anticommutative formula_69-graded algebra, where formula_72 is the identity map of the additive structure of .

== Graded monoid ==
Intuitively, a graded monoid is the subset of a graded ring, formula_73, generated by the formula_5&#x27;s, without using the additive part. That is, the set of elements of the graded monoid is formula_75.

Formally, a graded monoid is a monoid formula_76, with a gradation function formula_77 such that formula_78. Note that the gradation of formula_79 is necessarily 0. Some authors request furthermore that formula_80
when &quot;m&quot; is not the identity.

Assuming the gradations of non-identity elements are non-zero, the number of elements of gradation &quot;n&quot; is at most formula_81 where &quot;g&quot; is the cardinality of a generating set &quot;G&quot; of the monoid. Therefore the number of elements of gradation &quot;n&quot; or less is at most formula_82 (for formula_83) or formula_84 else. Indeed, each such element is the product of at most &quot;n&quot; elements of &quot;G&quot;, and only formula_84 such products exist. Similarly, the identity element can not be written as the product of two non-identity elements. That is, there is no unit divisor in such a graded monoid.

=== Power series indexed by a graded monoid ===
These notions allow us to extend the notion of power series ring. Instead of the indexing family being formula_86, the indexing family could be any graded monoid, assuming that the number of elements of degree &quot;n&quot; is finite, for each integer &quot;n&quot;.

More formally, let formula_87 be an arbitrary semiring and formula_88 a graded monoid. Then formula_89 denotes the semiring of power series with coefficients in &quot;K&quot; indexed by &quot;R&quot;. Its elements are functions from &quot;R&quot; to &quot;K&quot;. The sum of two elements formula_90 is defined pointwise, it is the function sending formula_91 to formula_92, and the product is the function sending formula_91 to the infinite sum formula_94. This sum is correctly defined (i.e., finite) because, for each &quot;m&quot;, there are only a finite number of pairs such that .

=== Free monoid ===
In formal language theory, given an alphabet &quot;A&quot;, the free monoid of words over &quot;A&quot; can be considered as a graded monoid, where the gradation of a word is its length.

<text>The 2002 Bali bombings were a series of terrorist attacks that occurred on 12 October 2002, in the tourist district of Kuta on the Indonesian island of Bali. The attacks killed 202 people (including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 23 Britons, and people of more than 20 other nationalities) and injured a further 209. General Da&#x27;i Bachtiar, the National Police Chief at the time, said that the bombings was the &quot;worst act of terror in Indonesia&#x27;s history&quot;.

Various members of Jemaah Islamiyah (also abbreviated JI), a violent Islamist group, were convicted in relation to the bombings, including three individuals who were sentenced to death. The attack involved the detonation of three bombs: a backpack-mounted device carried by a suicide bomber; a large car bomb, both of which were detonated in or near popular nightclubs in Kuta; and a third much smaller device detonated outside the United States consulate in Denpasar, causing only minor damage.

On 9 November 2005, one of the top JI&#x27;s bomb-maker and former Malaysian university lecturer Azahari Husin was killed in a police raid on a house in Batu, East Java. Azahari was believed to be the technical mastermind behind the Bali bombings and several bomb attacks in Indonesia. Three years later, on 9 November 2008, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim, Imam Samudra and Huda bin Abdul Haq were executed by firing squad on the island prison of Nusakambangan. On 9 March 2010, Dulmatin, nicknamed &quot;The Genius&quot;—believed to be responsible for setting off one of the Bali bombs with a mobile phone—was killed in a shoot-out with Indonesian police in Pamulang, South Tangerang.

== Attack ==

At 11:05 p.m. on 12 October 2002, a suicide bomber inside the nightclub &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Pub&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Irish Bar&quot; or &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Bar&quot;) detonated a bomb in his backpack, causing many patrons, with or without injuries, to immediately flee into the street. Twenty seconds later, a second and much more powerful car bomb hidden inside a white Mitsubishi van was detonated by another suicide bomber outside the &quot;Sari Club&quot;, a renowned thatch-roof bar located opposite &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Pub&quot;.

The bombing occurred during one of the busiest tourist periods of the year in Kuta Beach, driven in part by many Australian sporting teams making their annual end-of-season holiday.

Damage to the densely populated residential and commercial district was immense, destroying neighbouring buildings and shattering windows several blocks away. The car bomb explosion left a crater.

The local Sanglah Hospital was ill-equipped to deal with the scale of the disaster and was overwhelmed with the number of injured, particularly burn victims. There were so many people injured by the explosion that some of the injured had to be placed in hotel pools near the explosion site to ease the pain of their burns. Many of the injured had to be flown extreme distances to Darwin () and Perth () for specialist burn treatment.

A comparatively small bomb exploded outside the U.S. consulate in Denpasar, causing minor injuries to one person and minimal property damage. It was reportedly packed with human excrement, and is thought to have exploded shortly before the two Kuta bombs

A report released in August 2005 by the United States-Indonesia Society (USINDO) described the events as follows:
The investigators were thus able to recreate the bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber to put on his explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy&#x27;s Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.
The final death toll was 202, mainly comprising Western tourists and holiday-makers in their 20s and 30s who were in or near Paddy&#x27;s Pub or the Sari Club, but also including many Balinese Indonesians working or living nearby, or simply passing by. Hundreds more people suffered horrific burns and other injuries. The largest group among those killed were tourists from Australia with 88 fatalities. On 14 October, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1438 condemning the attack as a threat to international peace and security.

=== Awards ===
There were many acts of individual heroism in the aftermath of the bombings. Several of these acts would receive official recognition under Australia&#x27;s honours and awards system, particularly in the Special Honours List for 2003.

Timothy Britten, a Senior Constable with the Western Australia Police Force, and Richard Joyes were both awarded the Cross of Valour, Australia&#x27;s highest civilian honour, for entering the burning remains of the Sari Club to free a badly injured woman from the wreckage; after they had rescued the woman on the third attempt, both men then searched for other potential survivors until the increasing intensity of the flames and of secondary explosions made this impossible. Both men were aware of the possibility of being injured or even killed (Britten specifically believed in the possibility of yet another bomb being detonated at any moment in order to disrupt rescue efforts and kill emergency workers) and would indeed sustain several injuries during their efforts to rescue the woman and find other survivors.

Natalie Goold initially escaped from Paddy&#x27;s Bar after the bombings but then went back into the now-burning building, sustaining burns to her right arm and hand in the process, in order to rescue her friend, Nicole McLean, who had been heavily injured by the blasts. After asking two men for their shirts in order to use these as improvised tourniquets for her friend&#x27;s wounds, Goold secured McLean&#x27;s transportation to a local hospital and then stayed with her during their medical evacuation to Australia.

Robert Meredith and his group of friends were caught up in the bombing of the Sari Club; he was thrown onto his back and badly winded. Despite intense heat and flames, Meredith and his friends managed to help about ten other survivors escape by lifting them over a wall; while the wall ended up collapsing under people&#x27;s weight, injuring Meredith&#x27;s feet and depriving him of the already limited protection of his thong sandals, he managed to get to a staircase from where he helped yet more survivors get to safety. Meredith would ultimately be left with several burns and cuts to his feet.

Lauren Munro was also caught up in the Sari bombing, being rendered unconscious; when he came to, he pulled free an injured woman who had been trapped under roof beams, and carried her out of the building and over a wall of rubble. Munro helped several other people get over the same wall before re-entering the Sari Club and spending the next two hours carrying out many more injured people and helping to fight the fire. Ben Clohessy was also rendered unconscious by the blast that destroyed the Sari Club and also rescued or helped to rescue other survivors after regaining consciousness. Goold, Meredith, Munro, and Clohessy were all awarded the Star of Courage (SC) on 17 October 2003 for their respective actions.

Awards of the Commendation for Brave Conduct were made to, among other people, Hanabeth Luke. Luke was in the Sari Club with her partner Marc Gajado at the time of the second bombing, with the explosion throwing her to the ground. After managing to escape the now-burning building by climbing through its collapsed roof using severed electrical wire, Luke began a search for Gajado, during which she came across a badly injured Tom Singer. Singer was lying close to a burning car and Luke believed that he would be engulfed in flames if he remained there.

When Singer confirmed that he could not stand up independently, Luke helped him to his feet and supported him in walking away. Luke then tried to return to the Sari Club to resume looking for Gajado, but was persuaded by a friend that it was too dangerous to do so (Gajado was ultimately determined to have been killed instantly); she thus went back to attending to Singer, helping other people to get him into a car to be taken to hospital. Singer died in hospital a month later. Separately from her Commendation for Brave Conduct award, a photograph of Luke helping Singer was published in news media around the world in the days after the bombings.

Kusitino &#x27;Kossy&#x27; Halemai, a Wallis and Futuna-born Australian citizen who was managing the Bounty Hotel in Kuta at the time of the attacks, sheltered survivors in the immediate aftermath of the blasts. A makeshift triage area in the hotel&#x27;s reception area was organised by Richard and Gilana Poore, with the couple also fielding phone calls from the media and from families trying to trace loved ones. After three days of this, the Poores flew to Richard&#x27;s native New Zealand where they organised the collection of eighty boxes of medical supplies; they then returned to Bali with these supplies as well as two burns nurses. Halemai and the Poores were honoured with the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM), with Gilana Poore&#x27;s OAM being awarded on 26 January 2005, Halemai&#x27;s OAM being awarded on 13 June 2005, and Richard Poore&#x27;s OAM being awarded on 22 August 2005.

James Parkinson, an emergency nurse, worked alongside Doctor Hogg from Wollongong in the Denpasar Sanglah Hospital running the trauma centre for the bombing victims. After he disappeared in Africa and Europe for three years, the Governor General&#x27;s department finally tracked him down and awarded Parkinson the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2005.

=== The bomb ===
The Mitsubishi L300 van bomb was initially thought to have consisted of C4, a military grade plastic explosive which is difficult to obtain. However, investigators discovered the bomb was made from potassium chlorate, aluminium powder, and sulfur. For the Sari club bomb with the L300 van, the terrorists assembled 12 plastic filing cabinets filled with explosives. The cabinets, each containing a potassium chlorate, aluminum powder, sulfur mixture with a TNT booster, were connected by of PETN-filled detonating cord. Ninety-four RDX electric detonators were fitted to the TNT. The total weight of the van bomb was .
The large, high-temperature blast damage produced by this mixture was similar to a thermobaric explosive, although the bombers may not have known this.

== Suspects ==
The organization suspected of responsibility for the bombing was Jemaah Islamiyah, an Islamist group allegedly led by radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir. A week after the blasts, Arab satellite channel Al-Jazeera put to air an audio-cassette purportedly carrying a recorded voice message from Osama bin Laden that stated the Bali bombings were in direct retaliation for support of the United States&#x27; War on Terror and Australia&#x27;s role in the liberation of Timor-Leste.
You will be killed just as you kill, and will be bombed just as you bomb. Expect more that will further distress you.
The recording did not however claim responsibility for the Bali attack. Former FBI agent Ali Soufan confirmed in his book, &quot;The Black Banners&quot;, that al-Qaeda did in fact finance the attack. In addition, Riduan Isamuddin confessed that al-Qaeda had sent him US$30,000 to fund the bombings of the two nightclubs.

Aris Munandar (aka Sheik Aris) is a Jemaah Islamiyah associate linked to Bashir. He is believed to have assisted the Bali bomber Amrozi in acquiring some of the explosives used in the Bali bombings. Philippine intelligence considers Munandar to be associated with Mohammad Abdullah Sughayer, a Saudi national Abu Sayyaf Group in southern Philippines. Munandar is still at large. A report by the United States-Indonesia Society describes the arrest of Amrozi and other suspects.
General Pastika ordered his men to make the arrest early the next morning, November. Amrozi was asleep in the rear of the house. According to Greg Barton&#x27;s account, Amrozi did not attempt to escape, but laughed instead, later exclaiming, &quot;Gosh, you guys are very clever, how did you find me?&quot; Amrozi&#x27;s mobile phone, a particularly important piece of evidence, was seized during his arrest. Bags of chemical ingredients for bombs were found in his workshop and soil samples taken from outside his home showed traces of the primary chemical used in the Sari Club bomb. Police found receipts for the purchase of chemicals used to make the bombs, as well as a list of expenses incurred in making the bombs. Further search of Amrozi&#x27;s home revealed copies of speeches by Osama bin Laden, and Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian Muslim cleric reputed to be the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. The speeches exhorted listeners to wage jihad. Police also uncovered training manuals on ambush techniques and numerous articles on jihad. Under questioning Amrozi revealed the names of six others involved in the bombing: Ali Imron, Imam Samudra, Dul Matin, Idris, Abdul Ghani and Umar Patek. But Amrozi&#x27;s mobile phone proved to be the real catch. Indonesian investigators were able to print out a list of calls he had made immediately before, during and after the bombing, as well as the names and telephone numbers in the phone&#x27;s memory. Pastika kept Amrozi&#x27;s arrest secret for two days. After it was announced, Polri monitored the sudden flurry of communications among numbers listed in Amrozi&#x27;s telephone before the calls abruptly ceased. The investigators were able to identify the location of a number of the telephones, leading to a series of arrests.

Indonesian authorities also believe more suspects remain at large. In 2005, Indonesian police arrested 24 additional people suspected of involvement in the Bali attacks and a 2003 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta.

On 12 October 2005, a story in Australian broadcaster SBS&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Dateline&quot;, called &quot;Inside Indonesia&#x27;s War on Terrorism&quot;, argued that the Indonesian military or police may have been involved in executing the attack.

On 13 June 2007, it was reported that Abu Dujana, who might have headed a terrorist cell in Bali, was captured.

Just past midnight on 9 November 2008, the three convicted of carrying out the bombings (Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim, and Ali Ghufron) were executed by a firing squad.

Umar Patek was finally arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan in early 2011. The U.S. government had offered a US$1 million reward for his arrest. Patek is a suspect in other bombings as well as the one in Bali.

Another suspect named Zulkarnaen was finally arrested in Lampung on 10 December 2020. He was also stated to have orchestrated numerous Jemaah Islamiyah-related incidents in the past and been one of the executives of said terrorist group.

== Legal proceedings ==

=== Initial charges and trials ===
In April 2003, Indonesian authorities charged Abu Bakar Bashir (also rendered &quot;Ba&#x27;asyir&quot;), the alleged spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, with treason. It was alleged that he tried to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state. The specific charges against Bashir related to a series of church bombings on Christmas Eve in 2000, and to a plot to bomb United States and other Western interests in Singapore. He was initially not charged over the Bali attack, although he was frequently accused of being the instigator or inspirer of the attack. On 2 September, Bashir was acquitted of treason but convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to a prison term of four years. He said he would appeal.

On 15 October 2004, he was arrested by the Indonesian authorities and charged with involvement in another bomb attack, which killed 14 people at the J. W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta on 5 August 2003. Secondary charges in this indictment accused him of involvement in the Bali bombing, the first time he faced charges in relation to this attack.

On 3 March 2005, Bashir was found not guilty of the charges surrounding the 2003 bombing, but guilty of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks in Bali. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. The Australian, US, and many governments expressed its disappointment that the sentence was too short. In the outcome, Bashir was freed on 14 June 2006 having served less than 26 months for his conspiracy. On 21 December 2006, Bashir&#x27;s conviction was overturned by Indonesia&#x27;s Supreme Court.

On 30 April 2003, the first charges related to the Bali bombings were made against Amrozi bin Haji Nurhasyim, known as Amrozi, for allegedly buying the explosives and the van used in the bombings. On 8 August, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Another participant in the bombing, Imam Samudra, was sentenced to death on 10 September. Amrozi&#x27;s brother, Ali Imron, who had expressed remorse for his part in the bombing, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 September. A fourth accused, Ali Ghufron, the brother-in-law of Noordin Mohammed Top was sentenced to death on 1 October. Ali Ghufron, alias Mukhlas, told police that he was the head of one of Jemaah Islamiyah&#x27;s four cells and had ordered the Bali bombings. He also confessed that a fellow leader Riduan Isamuddin, known as Hambali, had provided the funds for the attacks. He told police, &quot;I do not know for sure the source of the aforementioned money from Hambali; most probably it was from Afghanistan, that is, from Sheikh Usama bin Laden. As far as I know, Hambali did not have a source of funds except from Afghanistan.&quot; Another operative, Wan Min bin Wan Mat, revealed to police that he had given Mukhlas money, at Hambali&#x27;s request and that he understood part of the money had come directly from al-Qaeda.

As noted below, all three were executed on 9 November 2008.
The Australian, US, and many other foreign governments expressed satisfaction with the speed and efficiency with which the Indonesian police and courts dealt with the bombings primary suspects, despite what they characterized as light sentences. All Australian jurisdictions abolished the death penalty more than 30 years ago, but a poll showed that 77% of Australians approved of the death sentence for Amrozi. The Australian government said it would not ask Indonesia to refrain from using the death penalty.

On 15 August, Riduan Isamuddin, generally known as Hambali, described as the operational chief of Jemaah Islamiyah was arrested in Ayutthaya, Thailand, the old capital one hour&#x27;s drive north of Bangkok. He is in American custody in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

=== Constitutional appeals ===
On 23 July 2004, one of the convicted bombers, Maskur Abdul Kadir, successfully appealed his conviction. He had been tried under retroactive laws which were introduced after the bombing and which were employed to aid the prosecution of those involved in the attack. These laws were used by the prosecution instead of existing criminal laws as they allowed the death penalty to be imposed and lowered certain evidentiary restrictions.

The highest court in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court, found by a margin of five to four that trying the terrorist suspects under these retroactive laws violated Article 28I(1) of the constitution [2]. The minority judges argued that international human rights documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allowed an exception to not applying retrospective legislation in the prosecution of crimes against humanity. The majority found that this argument was inconsistent with the text of Article 28I(1) which states that the rights listed there &quot;cannot be limited under any circumstances&quot;.

Following this decision, charges related to the bombings against Idris, who had confessed to participating in the attacks to the police and court, were dismissed. The legal status of Kadir, Idris and others who might have their convictions quashed following the ruling on the retrospective law is unclear.

The Constitutional Court is a relatively new body, created after the fall of Suharto, and this decision was one of the first to overrule the constitutionality of the government&#x27;s application of a law.

=== Execution of perpetrators ===
On 24 October 2008, Bali officials announced that three men convicted of carrying out the bombings would be executed by firing squad in November 2008. On 25 October 2008, Communications and Information Minister asked the Indonesian media to stop calling the three &quot;heroes&quot;.

The Denpasar District Court, on 3 November, accepted a reprieve motion to reconsider the death sentences. Fahmi Bachmid, a lawyer for the family of Jafar Sodiq, a brother of Amrozi and Mukhlas, stated: &quot;We lodged the judicial review to Denpasar court to question (previous) decisions.&quot; Lawyer Imam Asmara Hadi stated: &quot;We have lodged an appeal because we haven&#x27;t received a copy of the Supreme Court rejection of our previous appeal.&quot;

Indonesia&#x27;s Supreme Court denied previous petitions for judicial review amid the constitutional court&#x27;s dismissal of the bombers&#x27; appeals. Denpasar court official Nengah Sanjaya said the 3-page appeal would be sent to a Cilacap, central Java court. But the Attorney General&#x27;s office said on 1 November the execution was &quot;very close&quot;. Supreme Court judge Djoko Sarwoko, however, said a &quot;last-minute legal challenge by the relatives of Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron will not change or delay the execution.&quot; They were moved to isolation cells, and execution spots were ready on the Nusakambangan island prison where they were being held. Local chief prosecutor Muhammad Yamin said they would be &quot;executed simultaneously&quot; but at different locations.

Amrozi, Imam Samudra and Ali Ghufron were executed by firing squad after midnight on 9 November 2008 (West Indonesian time). In the final moment, there was no remorse or repentance, and they shouted: Allahu Akbar, or &quot;God is great!&quot; Despite his carefree demeanor throughout his trial and incarceration, the Australian edition of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported Amrozi was pale-faced and shaking in the moments before his execution. For burial, Mukhlas and Amrozi&#x27;s bodies were flown by helicopter to Tenggulun, Lamongan, East Java, while Imam Samudra&#x27;s body was flown to Serang, Banten, amid &quot;welcome martyrs&quot; banner displayed at the cemetery.

The execution caused high tension and sparked clashes in Tenggulun between hundreds of police and supporters. Indonesian singer and TV presenter Dorce Gamalama attended the funeral of Imam Samudra. After praying with the crowd, she spent half an hour in the house of the executed man and spoke with his mother. On leaving she was quoted as saying &quot;I&#x27;m certain he&#x27;s gone to heaven&quot;. Ma&#x27;ruf Amin, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Ulemas Council, the chief body for Islamic clerics in Indonesia said of the men: &quot;They did not die a holy death. That can only be in a war and Indonesia is not at war.&quot;

== Memorials ==

=== Bali ===
A permanent memorial was built on the site of the destroyed Paddy&#x27;s Pub on Legian Street. (A new bar, named &quot;Paddy&#x27;s: Reloaded&quot;, was reopened further along Legian Street). The memorial is made of intricately carved stone, set with a large marble plaque, which bears the names and nationalities of each of those killed. It is flanked by the national flags of the victims. The monument is well-maintained and illuminated at night.

The memorial was dedicated on 12 October 2004, the second anniversary of the attack. The dedication included a Balinese Hindu ceremony and the opportunity for mourners to lay flowers and other offerings. The Australian ambassador and Indonesian officials attended the ceremony.

The Balinese mark their commitment in a nine-day-long event. After major cleansing ceremonies, establishing a memorial for the lost lives, and paying respect to those who left loved ones behind, the people of Kuta look forward to restoring Bali&#x27;s image through an event named &quot;Kuta Karnival — A Celebration of Life&quot;. The community event consists of traditional art performances such as Balinese Sunset Dances, sports on the beach as well as in the water for young and old plus rows and rows of culinary displays along the one kilometre of sandy beach.

In line with the return of tourism to Kuta, Kuta Karnival has grown into a tourism promotional event with major coverage from television and newspapers from across the globe. Companies, embassies, Non-Government Organizations, associations and even individuals come forth to get involved in the various events such as a Balinese dance competition presented by a surf-wear company, an environment exhibition presented by an embassy, a fun cycle presented by a group of individuals, a seminar presented by an association and a parade on the streets presented by an NGO. Tourists and locals alike, more than ninety thousand people, participate in the numerous events year after year.

Further bombings in Bali in 2005 did not reduce the Kuta community&#x27;s determination to carry out this annual event. Kuta Karnival is conducted to commemorate and give respect to the victims of human violence and show the world the true spirit of local community survival despite terrorism attacks.

On 12 October 2010, Australian and Indonesian survivors of the 2002 bombings attended a solemn commemoration service to mark the eighth anniversary of the devastating attacks.

=== Melbourne ===

In Lincoln Square on the western side of Swanston Street in Carlton, Melbourne, is a memorial representing the 88 Australians who died in the bombings, and notably the 22 from Victoria.

There are 88 jets in the fountain; at night, there are lights representing all those who died. The fountain shuts off and becomes a reflecting pool on 12 October each year.

This was one of the very few fountains allowed to operate during the drought in 2007.

==== Jason McCartney ====

One Melburnian survivor of the bombings was North Melbourne AFL player Jason McCartney. He suffered second-degree burns to over 50% of his body while helping carry others to safety and nearly died during surgery after being transported back to Melbourne.

After a long rehabilitation process, McCartney returned for a single AFL match: North Melbourne vs. Richmond at Docklands Stadium in Melbourne on 6 June 2003. He wore compression garments and protective gloves as well as the numbers &quot;88&quot; and &quot;202&quot; on his jersey, signifying the Australian and total numbers of victims, while many in the crowd held up signs saying &quot;Bali 88/202&quot;. Other Australian victims were honored in a video shown on the stadium&#x27;s video screens before the game, with the attendees including Melbourne players Steven Febey and Steven Armstrong, who were both injured in the blast, and representatives from five Australian rules football clubs who lost players in the attacks were presented to the crowd. McCartney helped his team to a narrow win before announcing his retirement at the end of the game, and his comeback has been cited as one of the AFL&#x27;s most inspirational stories.

=== Perth ===

A memorial which lists the victims of the bombings from Western Australia was opened on the first anniversary, and is situated on the ridge of Mount Eliza in Kings Park, overlooking the city. The memorial is specifically designed to frame the sun&#x27;s rays at dawn on 12 October each year and faces in the exact direction of Bali.

=== Gold Coast ===
An Indonesian-style stone memorial is situated in Allambe Memorial Park at Nerang. A bronze plaque lists the names of the 88 Australians who died in the bombings. An annual twilight service is held at the site of the memorial on each anniversary of the Bali bombings.

=== Sydney ===

On the northern side of Coogee Beach a memorial to the Bali bombing victims comprises three interlocking bronze shapes that have an abstract resemblance to three bowed figures supporting each other. There are also some graffiti memorials in memory of the dead.

A memorial to seven residents of Sutherland Shire who were victims is at Cronulla. Called &quot;The Seed&quot;, the work is based on the seed and foliage of the &quot;Banksia robur&quot;, a native plant indigenous to the Shire. This sculpture of pink sandstone is the centrepiece of the memorial. It is set in a black granite pond located in &#x27;Peryman Place&#x27; not far from North Cronulla Beach, frequented by many of the seven victims and their families. Two plaques are set into the granite surrounding the pond. The plaques carry the victims&#x27; photos, names, and ages; and also details of the event, the design&#x27;s symbolism, its dedication, and a poem written by the families of the victims. The work is by sculptor Chris Bennetts and Ishi Buki Sandstone Sculpture.

South of Sydney, in the town of Ulladulla, a large youth centre is being built as a memorial to Craig Dunn and Danny Lewis, two local victims of the bombings. Money is being raised through the Dunn &amp; Lewis Youth Development Foundation.

=== Canberra ===
A granite cube serves as a memorial in the Eastern Formal Gardens of Parliament House.

=== London ===
On the fourth anniversary of the bombings the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall (now Charles III and Queen Camilla) unveiled a memorial in London, at the rear of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Main Building, facing St. James&#x27;s Park. The memorial consists of a 1.5-metre marble globe, to represent that people from 21 countries were killed, and has 202 doves carved into it. The names of all 202 victims are on a curved stone wall behind the globe. It is the work of the artist Gary Breeze and the sculptor Martin Cook.

There is a small stone memorial to the 28 British nationals who died, in the small country park of Ratby Burroughs in Leicestershire.

=== Hong Kong ===
In 2005, two marble wall placards were unveiled at Hong Kong Football Club in memory of the members of the club who were killed in the bombings (including Jake Young).

=== Singapore ===
Every year since 2002, the Rugby Section of the Singapore Cricket Club (the &quot;SCC&quot;) has held a dawn memorial service on the Padang (the SCC&#x27;s rugby field in central Singapore) on the anniversary of the bombings, to honour the memory of the eight players which the SCC lost (Neil Bowler, Chris Redman, Dave Kent, Peter Record, Tim Arnold, Chris Bradford, Chris Kays and Charlie Vanrenen). The service is attended by survivors of the 2002 rugby tour to Bali, friends and family of those who lost their lives, as well as current and past players of the club.

The SCC also maintains a permanent memorial to the players it lost inside the club&#x27;s main lounge.

=== Vietnam ===
A remembrance garden was constructed at the International School Ho Chi Minh City commemorating teachers from that school who were killed in the bombings.

== In media ==

In 2006, &quot;Long Road to Heaven&quot;, an Indonesian feature film about the bombings, was released by Kalyana Shira Films. The film was directed by Enison Sinaro and written by Wong Wai Leng and Andy Logam-Tan. It stars Raelee Hill, Mirrah Foulkes, Alex Komang, Surya Saputra, John O&#x27; Hare, Sarah Treleaven, and Joshua Pandelaki. It tells the story during three different times: the planning a few months before the bombing, its execution in 2002, and the trials in 2003 through the viewpoints of both the victims and the bombers. The story is not chronologically linear, starting with the explosion and then moving from time to time so as all three plots are culminated one after the other. At the beginning of each scene, subtitles tell the date and location of the scene.

A comic book about the first Bali bombing was launched to promote peace and discourage radicalism and terrorism in Indonesia. The book, &quot;Ketika Nurani Bicara&quot; (When Conscience Speaks), tells about the bombing from the perspective of three people: a volunteer who helped evacuate a bombing victim who lost her husband in the blast; a victim who struggled to raise her children without her husband; and a terrorist who regrets his involvement in the bombing.

A &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; episode, &quot;Bali Bombings&quot;, was a documentary telling the story of what happened, and looking at what happened after the incident.

A &quot;Zero Hour&quot; documentary depicts the disaster.

In 2022 (20 years after the incident), the Australian-Indonesian historical drama &quot;Bali 2002&quot;, aired on Stan and Nine Network.

<text>Jemaah Islamiyah (, &quot;al-Jamāʿah al-Islāmiyyah&quot;, meaning &quot;Islamic Congregation&quot;, frequently abbreviated JI) was a Southeast Asian Islamist militant group based in Indonesia, which was dedicated to the establishment of an Islamic state in Southeast Asia. On 25 October 2002, immediately following the JI-perpetrated 2002 Bali bombings, JI was added to the UN Security Council Resolution 1267.

JI was a transnational organization with cells in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. In addition to Al-Qaeda, the group is also alleged to have links to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid, a splinter cell of the JI which was formed by Abu Bakar Baasyir on 27 July 2008. The group has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. It remained very active in Indonesia where it publicly maintained a website .

In October 2021, the Director of Identification and Socialization of Detachment 88 Muhammad Sodiq said that 876 members of Jamaah Islamiyah had been arrested and sentenced in Indonesia.

On 16 November 2021, the Indonesian National Police launched a crackdown operation, which revealed that the group operated in disguise as a political party, the Indonesian People&#x27;s Da&#x27;wah Party. The revelation shocked the public, as it was the first time in Indonesia that a terrorist organization disguised itself as a political party and attempted to intervene and participate in the Indonesian political system.

==History==
JI has its roots in Darul Islam (DI, meaning &quot;House of Islam&quot;), a radical Islamist/anti-colonialist movement in Indonesia in the 1940s.

The JI was established as a loose confederation of several Islamic groups. Sometimes around 1969, three men, Abu Bakar Bashir, Abdullah Sungkar and Shahrul Nizam &#x27;PD&#x27; began an operation to propagate the Darul Islam movement, a conservative strain of Islam.

Bashir and Sungkar were both imprisoned by the New Order administration of Indonesian president Suharto as part of a crackdown on radical groups such as Komando Jihad, that were perceived to undermine the government&#x27;s control over the Indonesian population. The two leaders spent several years in prison. After release, Bashir and his followers moved to Malaysia in 1982. They recruited people from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. The group officially named itself Jemaah Islamiyah around that time period.

JI was formally founded on 1 January 1993, by JI leaders, Abu Bakar Bashir and Abdullah Sungkar while hiding in Malaysia from the persecution of the Suharto government. After the fall of the Suharto regime in 1998, both men returned to Indonesia where JI gained a terrorist edge when one of its founders, the late Abdullah Sungkar, established contact with Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Al-Qaeda network.

JI&#x27;s violent operations began during the communal conflicts in Maluku and Poso. It shifted its attention to targeting U.S. and Western interests in Indonesia and the wider Southeast Asian region since the start of the U.S.-led war on terror. JI&#x27;s terror plans in Southeast Asia were exposed when its plot to set off several bombs in Singapore was foiled by the local authorities.

In 2004, Abu Bakar Bashir created the Indonesian Mujahedeen Council to connect Islamist groups, including JI, in Indonesia.

Recruiting, training, indoctrination, financial, and operational links between the JI and other militant groups, such as Al-Qaeda, the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), the Misuari Renegade/Breakaway Group (MRG/MBG) and the Philippine Rajah Sulaiman movement (RSM) have existed for many years.

Bashir became the spiritual leader of the group while Hambali became the military leader. Unlike the Al-Mau&#x27;nah group, Jemaah Islamiyah kept a low profile in Malaysia and their existence was publicized only after the 2002 Bali bombings. It is suspected by some to be linked to Al-Qaeda or the Taliban.

===Designation as a terrorist group===
Jemaah Islamiyah has been designated a terrorist group by the following countries and international organizations:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

===2002 Bali bombings===
Prior to the first Bali bombings on 12 October 2002, there was underestimation to the threat Jemaah Islamiyah posed. After this attack, the U.S. State Department designated Jemaah Islamiyah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

===Other terrorist attacks===
In 2003, Indonesian police confirmed the existence of &quot;Mantiqe-IV&quot;  the JI regional cell which covered Irian Jaya and Australia. Indonesian police said Muklas has identified Mantiqe IV&#x27;s leader as Abdul Rahim—an Indonesian-born Australian. Jemaah Islamiyah is also strongly suspected of carrying out the 2003 JW Marriott hotel bombing, the 2004 Australian embassy bombing, the 2005 Bali bombings and the 2009 JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotel bombings. The Bali and JW Marriott attacks showed that JI did not rule out attacking the same target more than once. The JI also has been directly and indirectly involved in dozens of bombings in the southern Philippines, usually in league with the ASG.

However, most of Jemaah Islamiyah prominent figures such as Hambali, Abu Dujana, Azahari Husin, Noordin Top and Dulmatin have either been captured or killed, mostly by Indonesian anti-terrorist squad, Detachment 88. While several of its former leaders, including Malaysian Islamic extremist and Afghanistan War veteran Nasir Abbas, have renounced violence and even assisted the Indonesian and Malaysian governments in the war on terrorism. Nasir Abbas was Noordin Top&#x27;s former trainer.

Indonesian investigators revealed the JI&#x27;s establishment of a hit squad in April 2007, which was established to target top leaders who oppose the group&#x27;s objectives, as well as other officials, including police officers, government prosecutors and judges handling terrorism-related cases.

In April 2008, the South Jakarta District Court declared JI an illegal organisation when sentencing former leader Zarkasih and military commander Abu Dujana to 15 years on terrorism charges.

In 2010, Indonesian authorities cracked down on the Jemaah Islamiyah network in Aceh. Between February and May 2010, more than 60 militants were captured. This Aceh network was established by Dulmatin sometime after 2007 when he returned to Indonesia.

==Naming==
The name &quot;Jemaah Islamiyah&quot; roughly translates to &quot;Islamic Community&quot; in English and is abbreviated as &quot;JI&quot;. To counter the recruitment efforts by the group, Islamic scholars in Indonesia and the Philippines who are critical of the group suggested it be called &quot;Jemaah Munafiq&quot; (JM) instead, translated as &quot;Hypocrites&#x27; Community&quot;.

<doc id="103103" wikidata="Q108907477" url="?curid=103103" title="Polish proverbs">
<text>Tens of thousands of Polish proverbs exist; many have origins in the Middle Ages. The oldest known Polish proverb dates to 1407. A number of scholarly studies of Polish proverbs (paremiology) exist; and Polish proverbs have been collected in numerous dictionaries and similar works from the 17th century onward. Studies in Polish paremiology have begun in the 19th century. The largest and most reputable collection of Polish proverbs to date, edited by Julian Krzyżanowski, was published in 1970s. 

== History ==
The oldest known Polish proverb, dating to 1407, was written in Latin and Old Polish: &quot;Quando sø lika drø, tunc ea drzi&quot;, which translates to &quot;When bast can be torn, then tear it.&quot; This is analogous to &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;. The oldest Polish proverb thus reminded peasants to seize the opportunity when the time was right – to harvest bast in the spring, which they would turn into bast shoes, textiles, and cordage in winter.

Some Polish proverbs have been medieval translations of Latin classics. Thus, &quot;Oko pańskie konia tuczy&quot; – &quot;The master&#x27;s eye fattens the horse&quot; – comes from the Latin &quot;Oculus domini saginat equum&quot;; and the latter Latin proverb was likely translated from a still older Persian one. Other proverbs have taken their origin from other European languages. 

Many proverbs have been popularized by Polish literature. For example, the popularity of &quot;Oko pańskie konia tuczy&quot; has been attributed to its inclusion in Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;.

== Themes ==
As with proverbs of other peoples around the world, Polish proverbs concern many topics; at least 2,000 Polish proverbs relate to weather and climate alone. Many concern classic topics such as fortune and misfortune, religion, family, everyday life, health, love, wealth, and women; others, like the first recorded Polish proverb (referring to bast production), and those about weather, offer practical advice. A theme unique to Polish proverbs is about Poles and Poland; one of the most famous of these states that &quot;Polacy nie gęsi lecz własny język mają&quot; (&quot;Poles are not geese, they have their own tongue&quot;), in a 1562 verse by Mikołaj Rej, and commonly interpreted as stressing the importance of having one&#x27;s own national language (here, Polish).

Similarly to English proverbs, Polish proverbs have been criticized for being sexist.

== Polish paremiology ==

The first known Polish author interested in proverbs was the poet Biernat of Lublin, who in 1522 published a collection of them titled &quot;, mędrca obyczajnego i z przypowieściami jego&quot; (The life of Aesop the Phrygian, a Decent Sage, and with His Parables). The first Polish scholar of paremiology was (Solomone Rysinio), who in 1618 published the first known Polish work dedicated solely to collecting and discussing proverbs (&quot;Proverbiorum polonicorum a Salomone Rysino collectorum Centuriae decem et octo&quot;). This work, first published in Latin, but subsequently in Polish (&quot;Przypowieści polskie, przez Salomona Rysińskiego zebrane, a teraz nowo przydane i na wielu miejscach poprawione&quot;, 1620), collected over 1,800 proverbs which, according to the author, were &quot;of Polish origin&quot;. In 1632, Grzegorz Knapski, a Polish Jesuit, published an even larger collection (in volume three of his &quot;Thesaurus Polono-Latino-Graecus&quot;), with over 6,000 collected proverbs. In 1658 Polish writer Andrzej Maksymilian Fredro published another collection of proverbs, &quot;Przysłowia mów potocznych albo przestrogi obyczajowe, radne, wojenne&quot;, which was said to have been widely popular in contemporary Poland.

The 19th century saw the first work dedicated more to analyzing the proverbs and their history than solely collecting them, the &quot;Przysłowia narodowe, z wyjaśnieniem źródła, początku oraz sposobu ich użycia, okazujące charakter, zwyczaje i obyczaje, przesądy, starożytności i wspomnienia ojczyste&quot; (1830) of . Other early works on Polish paremiology were published in the 19th century by Oskar Kolberg and Samuel Adalberg, the latter publishing a collection of over 30,000 Polish proverbs (&quot;Księga przysłów, przypowieści i wyrażeń przysłowiowych polskich&quot; - The Book of Polish Proverbs - 1889–1894). Adalberg&#x27;s work was praised as &quot;the first modern work on this topic in Polish&quot; and &quot;the most extensive collection ever made in this field&quot;. The early 20th century saw further scholarly analysis of Polish proverbs by scholars such as Aleksander Brückner and Jan Stanisław Bystroń, the latter known as &quot;the father of modern Polish paremiology&quot;, and the author of the monograph simply titled &quot;Przysłowia polskie&quot; (Polish proverbs, 1933). After World War II, significant contributions to the field of Polish paremiology were carried out by Julian Krzyżanowski. He was the editor of the largest and most reputable collection of Polish proverbs to date, &quot;Nowa księga przysłów i wyrażeń przysłowiowych polskich&quot; (New Book of Polish Proverbs and Proverbial Expressions, also known as &quot;Nowa Księga przysłów polskich&quot;, A New Book of Polish Proverbs, published in several volumes in the years 1969–1978), dubbed the &quot;bible of Polish proverbs&quot;. Despite the proliferation of similar works in later years, in 2012 his work was still described as &quot;the most comprehensive&quot; of its type in Poland. Other notable modern Polish paremiologists include , Dobrosława Świerczyńska, , and Władysław Kopaliński.

In 2009–2018 alone, 16 collections of proverbs aimed at young readers were published in Poland; many addressed to a mass audience are of varying quality.

<doc id="103109" wikidata="Q1268589" url="?curid=103109" title="Outer product">
<text>In linear algebra, the outer product of two coordinate vectors is the matrix whose entries are all products of an element in the first vector with an element in the second vector. If the two coordinate vectors have dimensions &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, then their outer product is an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;m&quot; matrix. More generally, given two tensors (multidimensional arrays of numbers), their outer product is a tensor. The outer product of tensors is also referred to as their tensor product, and can be used to define the tensor algebra.

The outer product contrasts with:
* The dot product (a special case of &quot;inner product&quot;), which takes a pair of coordinate vectors as input and produces a scalar
* The Kronecker product, which takes a pair of matrices as input and produces a block matrix
* Standard matrix multiplication

==Definition==
Given two vectors of size formula_1 and formula_2 respectively
:formula_3
their outer product, denoted formula_4 is defined as the formula_5 matrix formula_6 obtained by multiplying each element of formula_7 by each element of 
:formula_8

Or, in index notation:
:formula_9

Denoting the dot product by formula_10 if given an formula_2 vector formula_12 then formula_13 If given a formula_14 vector formula_15 then formula_16

If formula_7 and formula_18 are vectors of the same dimension bigger than 1, then formula_19.

The outer product formula_20 is equivalent to a matrix multiplication formula_21 provided that formula_7 is represented as a formula_1 column vector and formula_18 as a formula_2 column vector (which makes formula_26 a row vector). For instance, if formula_27 and formula_28 then
:formula_29

For complex vectors, it is often useful to take the conjugate transpose of formula_30 denoted formula_31 or formula_32:
:formula_33

===Contrast with Euclidean inner product===
If formula_34 then one can take the matrix product the other way, yielding a scalar (or formula_35 matrix):
:formula_36
which is the standard inner product for Euclidean vector spaces, better known as the dot product. The dot product is the trace of the outer product. Unlike the dot product, the outer product is not commutative.

Multiplication of a vector formula_37 by the matrix formula_20 can be written in terms of the inner product, using the relation formula_39.

===The outer product of tensors===
Given two tensors formula_40 with dimensions formula_41 and formula_42, their outer product formula_20 is a tensor with dimensions formula_44 and entries
:formula_45

For example, if formula_6 is of order 3 with dimensions formula_47 and formula_48 is of order 2 with dimensions formula_49 then their outer product formula_50 is of order 5 with dimensions formula_51 If formula_6 has a component and formula_48 has a component , then the component of formula_50 formed by the outer product is .

===Connection with the Kronecker product===
The outer product and Kronecker product are closely related; in fact the same symbol is commonly used to denote both operations.

If formula_55 and formula_56, we have:
:formula_57

In the case of column vectors, the Kronecker product can be viewed as a form of vectorization (or flattening) of the outer product. In particular, for two column vectors formula_7 and formula_18, we can write:
:formula_60

(The order of the vectors is reversed on the right side of the equation.)

Another similar identity that further highlights the similarity between the operations is
:formula_61

where the order of vectors needs not be flipped. The middle expression uses matrix multiplication, where the vectors are considered as column/row matrices.

===Connection with the matrix product===
Given a pair of matrices formula_6 of size formula_63 and formula_48 of size formula_65, consider the matrix product formula_66 defined as usual as a matrix of size formula_67.

Now let formula_68 be the formula_69-th column vector of formula_70 and let formula_71 be the formula_69-th row vector of formula_73. Then formula_50 can be expressed as a sum of column-by-row outer products:
:formula_75
This expression has duality with the more common one as a matrix built with row-by-column inner product entries (or dot product): formula_76

This relation is relevant in the application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (and Spectral Decomposition as a special case). In particular, the decomposition can be interpreted as the sum of outer products of each left (formula_77) and right (formula_78) singular vectors, scaled by the corresponding nonzero singular value formula_79:
:formula_80

This result implies that formula_6 can be expressed as a sum of rank-1 matrices with spectral norm formula_79 in decreasing order. This explains the fact why, in general, the last terms contribute less, which motivates the use of the truncated SVD as an approximation. The first term is the least squares fit of a matrix to an outer product of vectors.

==Properties==
The outer product of vectors satisfies the following properties:
:formula_83

The outer product of tensors satisfies the additional associativity property:
:formula_84

===Rank of an outer product===
If u and v are both nonzero, then the outer product matrix uvT always has matrix rank 1. Indeed, the columns of the outer product are all proportional to u. Thus they are all linearly dependent on that one column, hence the matrix is of rank one.

(&quot;Matrix rank&quot; should not be confused with &quot;tensor order&quot;, or &quot;tensor degree&quot;, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;rank&quot;.)

==Definition (abstract)==
Let and be two vector spaces. The outer product of formula_85 and formula_86 is the element formula_87.

If is an inner product space, then it is possible to define the outer product as a linear map . In this case, the linear map formula_88 is an element of the dual space of , as this maps linearly a vector into its underlying field, of which formula_89 is an element. The outer product is then given by
:formula_90

This shows why a conjugate transpose of is commonly taken in the complex case.

==In programming languages==
In some programming languages, given a two-argument function codice_1 (or a binary operator), the outer product, codice_1, of two one-dimensional arrays, codice_3 and codice_4, is a two-dimensional array codice_5 such that codice_6. This is syntactically represented in various ways: in APL, as the infix binary operator ∘.f; in J, as the postfix adverb f/; in R, as the function outer(A, B, f) or the special %o%; in Mathematica, as Outer[f, A, B]. In MATLAB, the function kron(A, B) is used for this product. These often generalize to multi-dimensional arguments, and more than two arguments.

In the Python library NumPy, the outer product can be computed with function codice_7. In contrast, codice_8 results in a flat array. The outer product of multidimensional arrays can be computed using codice_9.

==Applications==
As the outer product is closely related to the Kronecker product, some of the applications of the Kronecker product use outer products. These applications are found in quantum theory, signal processing, and image compression.

===Spinors===
Suppose so that and are in . Then the outer product of these complex 2-vectors is an element of , the 2 × 2 complex matrices:
:formula_91
The determinant of this matrix is because of the commutative property of .

In the theory of spinors in three dimensions, these matrices are associated with isotropic vectors due to this null property. Élie Cartan described this construction in 1937, but it was introduced by Wolfgang Pauli in 1927 so that has come to be called Pauli algebra.

===Concepts===
The block form of outer products is useful in classification. Concept analysis is a study that depends on certain outer products:

When a vector has only zeros and ones as entries, it is called a &quot;logical vector&quot;, a special case of a logical matrix. The logical operation &quot;and&quot; takes the place of multiplication. The outer product of two logical vectors and is given by the logical matrix formula_92. This type of matrix is used in the study of binary relations, and is called a &quot;rectangular relation&quot; or a cross-vector.

<text>Catriona Ann Le May Doan, (born December 23, 1970) is a retired Canadian speed skater and a double Olympic champion in the 500 m. She served as the chef de mission for Team Canada at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

==Career==
===Speed skating===
Born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, of Scottish ancestry, Le May Doan won the Olympic 500 m title at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. She repeated the feat at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, giving rise to the title &quot;the fastest woman on ice&quot;. At the Nagano Olympics, she also won a bronze in the 1,000 m. She was World Sprint Champion 1998 and 2002 and World Champion 500 m 1998, 1999, and 2001, and won a 500 m bronze in 2000. She also won the 500 m World Cup 4 times (in 1998, 1999, 2001, and 2003) and the 1,000 m World Cup once (in 1998). She was Canada&#x27;s flag bearer at the Winter Olympics twice, for the 1998 Nagano Olympics closing ceremony and the opening ceremony of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.

On November 22, 1997, Le May Doan became the first woman to break the 38-second barrier for the 500 m, skating 37.90 s in Calgary, Alberta. Before the year was over, she had tied the record once and broken it twice, ending on 37.55 s. Within the next four years, she broke this record four more times, up to 37.22 s in Calgary, in December 2001. Between 7 January 2001 and 24 February 2001, Le May Doan was the only woman under the 38-second barrier, achieving it 14 times, including the eight times that she lowered the overall record.

In the 1994 Winter Olympics, Le May Doan fell on the 500 m and placed 17th on the 1,500 m. Prior to Nagano, she was training with her teammate and rival Susan Auch, both being coached by Susan&#x27;s brother, Derrick Auch. In 1998, Susan Auch placed second behind Le May Doan on the 500 m. Leading up to the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, Le May Doan was coached by Sean Ireland.

Le May Doan repeated her gold medal in the 500m at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. She became the first Canadian to defend their gold medal at the Olympics.

===After speedskating===

Le May Doan retired from competitive skating in 2003. She was a commentator for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and was a member of the official Canadian contingent when Vancouver was chosen as the site of the 2010 Winter Olympics. She is a popular motivational speaker, and has been involved with Campus Crusade for Christ&#x27;s &quot;Power to Change&quot; campaign.

In 2005, Le May Doan was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame.

Le May Doan provided colour commentary for the CBC during the 2006 Winter Olympics for speed skating. She was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008 and was also a colour commentator for CTV at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She was one of four torchbearers selected to light the interior cauldron in BC Place at the opening ceremonies for the 2010 Winter Olympics. She was subsequently left out of the lighting when one of the arms to light the cauldron failed to rise due to mechanical problems. This was remediated as part of the opening segment of the closing ceremonies when she lit the fourth arm of the cauldron.

In November 2020, it was announced that Le May Doan would be the chef de mission for Team Canada at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

In June 2023, Le May Doan was appointed Honorary Consul of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Calgary.

==Personal life==
Le May Doan was married to Bart Doan. They separated in 2017. She has two children, Greta and Easton.

In 2002, Le May Doan published an autobiography, &quot;Going for Gold&quot;.

<doc id="103118" wikidata="Q187959" url="?curid=103118" title="Distributive property">
<text>In mathematics, the distributive property of binary operations is a generalization of the distributive law, which asserts that the equality
formula_1
is always true in elementary algebra.
For example, in elementary arithmetic, one has
formula_2
Therefore, one would say that multiplication &quot;distributes&quot; over addition.

This basic property of numbers is part of the definition of most algebraic structures that have two operations called addition and multiplication, such as complex numbers, polynomials, matrices, rings, and fields. It is also encountered in Boolean algebra and mathematical logic, where each of the logical and (denoted formula_3) and the logical or (denoted formula_4) distributes over the other.

== Definition ==

Given a set formula_5 and two binary operators formula_6 and formula_7 on formula_8
*the operation formula_6 is over (or with respect to) formula_7 if, given any elements formula_11 of formula_8
formula_13
*the operation formula_6 is over formula_7 if, given any elements formula_11 of formula_8
formula_18 
*and the operation formula_6 is over formula_7 if it is left- and right-distributive.

When formula_6 is commutative, the three conditions above are logically equivalent.

== Meaning ==

The operators used for examples in this section are those of the usual addition formula_7 and multiplication formula_23

If the operation denoted formula_24 is not commutative, there is a distinction between left-distributivity and right-distributivity:

formula_25
formula_26

In either case, the distributive property can be described in words as:

To multiply a sum (or difference) by a factor, each summand (or minuend and subtrahend) is multiplied by this factor and the resulting products are added (or subtracted).

If the operation outside the parentheses (in this case, the multiplication) is commutative, then left-distributivity implies right-distributivity and vice versa, and one talks simply of .

One example of an operation that is &quot;only&quot; right-distributive is division, which is not commutative:
formula_27 
In this case, left-distributivity does not apply:
formula_28

The distributive laws are among the axioms for rings (like the ring of integers) and fields (like the field of rational numbers). Here multiplication is distributive over addition, but addition is not distributive over multiplication. Examples of structures with two operations that are each distributive over the other are Boolean algebras such as the algebra of sets or the switching algebra.

Multiplying sums can be put into words as follows: When a sum is multiplied by a sum, multiply each summand of a sum with each summand of the other sum (keeping track of signs) then add up all of the resulting products.

== Examples ==

=== Real numbers ===

In the following examples, the use of the distributive law on the set of real numbers formula_29 is illustrated. When multiplication is mentioned in elementary mathematics, it usually refers to this kind of multiplication. From the point of view of algebra, the real numbers form a field, which ensures the validity of the distributive law.


=== Matrices ===

The distributive law is valid for matrix multiplication. More precisely,
formula_30
for all formula_31-matrices formula_32 and formula_33-matrices formula_34 as well as
formula_35
for all formula_31-matrices formula_37 and formula_33-matrices formula_39 
Because the commutative property does not hold for matrix multiplication, the second law does not follow from the first law. In this case, they are two different laws.

=== Other examples ===

* Multiplication of ordinal numbers, in contrast, is only left-distributive, not right-distributive.
* The cross product is left- and right-distributive over vector addition, though not commutative.
* The union of sets is distributive over intersection, and intersection is distributive over union.
* Logical disjunction (&quot;or&quot;) is distributive over logical conjunction (&quot;and&quot;), and vice versa.
* For real numbers (and for any totally ordered set), the maximum operation is distributive over the minimum operation, and vice versa: formula_40
* For integers, the greatest common divisor is distributive over the least common multiple, and vice versa: formula_41
* For real numbers, addition distributes over the maximum operation, and also over the minimum operation: formula_42
* For binomial multiplication, distribution is sometimes referred to as the FOIL Method (First terms formula_43 Outer formula_44 Inner formula_45 and Last formula_46) such as: formula_47
* In all semirings, including the complex numbers, the quaternions, polynomials, and matrices, multiplication distributes over addition: formula_48
* In all algebras over a field, including the octonions and other non-associative algebras, multiplication distributes over addition.

== Propositional logic ==
=== Rule of replacement ===

In standard truth-functional propositional logic, in logical proofs uses two valid rules of replacement to expand individual occurrences of certain logical connectives, within some formula, into separate applications of those connectives across subformulas of the given formula. The rules are
formula_49
where &quot;formula_50&quot;, also written formula_51 is a metalogical symbol representing &quot;can be replaced in a proof with&quot; or &quot;is logically equivalent to&quot;.

=== Truth functional connectives ===

 is a property of some logical connectives of truth-functional propositional logic. The following logical equivalences demonstrate that distributivity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional tautologies.
formula_52

;Double distribution: 
formula_53

== Distributivity and rounding ==

In approximate arithmetic, such as floating-point arithmetic, the distributive property of multiplication (and division) over addition may fail because of the limitations of arithmetic precision. For example, the identity formula_54 fails in decimal arithmetic, regardless of the number of significant digits. Methods such as banker&#x27;s rounding may help in some cases, as may increasing the precision used, but ultimately some calculation errors are inevitable.

==In rings and other structures==

Distributivity is most commonly found in semirings, notably the particular cases of rings and distributive lattices.

A semiring has two binary operations, commonly denoted formula_7 and formula_56 and requires that formula_6 must distribute over formula_58

A ring is a semiring with additive inverses.

A lattice is another kind of algebraic structure with two binary operations, formula_59 
If either of these operations distributes over the other (say formula_3 distributes over formula_61), then the reverse also holds (formula_4 distributes over formula_3), and the lattice is called distributive. See also .

A Boolean algebra can be interpreted either as a special kind of ring (a Boolean ring) or a special kind of distributive lattice (a Boolean lattice). Each interpretation is responsible for different distributive laws in the Boolean algebra.

Similar structures without distributive laws are near-rings and near-fields instead of rings and division rings. The operations are usually defined to be distributive on the right but not on the left.

== Generalizations ==
In several mathematical areas, generalized distributivity laws are considered. This may involve the weakening of the above conditions or the extension to infinitary operations. Especially in order theory one finds numerous important variants of distributivity, some of which include infinitary operations, such as the infinite distributive law; others being defined in the presence of only binary operation, such as the according definitions and their relations are given in the article distributivity (order theory). This also includes the notion of a completely distributive lattice.

In the presence of an ordering relation, one can also weaken the above equalities by replacing formula_64 by either formula_65 or formula_66 Naturally, this will lead to meaningful concepts only in some situations. An application of this principle is the notion of sub-distributivity as explained in the article on interval arithmetic.

In category theory, if formula_67 and formula_68 are monads on a category formula_34 a distributive law formula_70 is a natural transformation formula_71 such that formula_72 is a lax map of monads formula_73 and formula_74 is a colax map of monads formula_75 This is exactly the data needed to define a monad structure on formula_76: the multiplication map is formula_77 and the unit map is formula_78 See: distributive law between monads.

A generalized distributive law has also been proposed in the area of information theory.

=== Antidistributivity ===

The ubiquitous identity that relates inverses to the binary operation in any group, namely formula_79 which is taken as an axiom in the more general context of a semigroup with involution, has sometimes been called an antidistributive property (of inversion as a unary operation).

In the context of a near-ring, which removes the commutativity of the additively written group and assumes only one-sided distributivity, one can speak of (two-sided) distributive elements but also of antidistributive elements. The latter reverse the order of (the non-commutative) addition; assuming a left-nearring (i.e. one which all elements distribute when multiplied on the left), then an antidistributive element formula_80 reverses the order of addition when multiplied to the right: formula_81

In the study of propositional logic and Boolean algebra, the term antidistributive law is sometimes used to denote the interchange between conjunction and disjunction when implication factors over them:
formula_82
formula_83

These two tautologies are a direct consequence of the duality in De Morgan&#x27;s laws.

<text>Pseudoscientific beliefs in a flat Earth are promoted by a number of organizations and individuals. The claims of modern flat Earth proponents are not based on scientific knowledge and are contrary to over two millennia of scientific consensus based on multiple confirming lines of evidence that Earth is roughly spherical. Flat Earth beliefs are classified by experts in philosophy and physics as a form of science denial.

Flat Earth groups of the modern era date from the middle of the 20th century; some adherents are serious and some are not. Those who are serious are often motivated by religion or conspiracy theories. Through the use of social media, flat Earth theories have been increasingly espoused and promoted by individuals unaffiliated with larger groups. Many believers make use of social media to spread their views.

==Background ==

Contrary to the popular belief that the Earth was generally believed to be flat until a few hundred years ago, the spherical shape of the Earth (and other celestial bodies) has been widely accepted in the Western world (and universally by scholars) since at least the Hellenistic period (323 BCE–31 BCE), with the first known measurement of Earth&#x27;s circumference conducted by Eratosthenes.

It is only comparatively recently that the Flat Earth concept has grown widespread support, due to Samuel Rowbotham in the 19th century. 
Flat Earth beliefs have had a notable recent resurgence since 2015, due to the internet.

==19th and early 20th centuries==
Modern flat Earth belief originated with the English writer Samuel Rowbotham (1816–1884). Based on conclusions derived from his 1838 Bedford Level experiment, Rowbotham published the 1849 pamphlet titled &quot;Zetetic Astronomy&quot;, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Parallax&quot;. He later expanded this into the book &quot;Earth Not a Globe&quot;, proposing the Earth is a flat disc centred at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice, Antarctica. Rowbotham further held that the Sun and Moon were above Earth and that the &quot;cosmos&quot; was above the Earth. He also published a leaflet titled &quot;The Inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scriptures&quot;, which argued that the &quot;Bible, alongside our senses, supported the idea that the Earth was flat and immovable and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture&quot;.

Rowbotham and followers like William Carpenter gained attention by successful use of pseudoscience in public debates with leading scientists such as Alfred Russel Wallace. Rowbotham created a Zetetic Society in England and New York, shipping over a thousand copies of &quot;Zetetic Astronomy&quot; to the New York branch. Wallace repeated the Bedford Level experiment in 1870, correcting for atmospheric refraction and showing a spherical Earth.

In 1877, John Hampden produced a book &quot;A New Manual of Biblical Cosmography&quot;. Rowbotham also produced studies that purported to show that the effects of ships disappearing below the horizon could be explained by the laws of perspective in relation to the human eye.

After Rowbotham&#x27;s death, Lady Elizabeth Blount established the Universal Zetetic Society in 1893, whose objective was &quot;the propagation of knowledge related to Natural Cosmogony in confirmation of the Holy Scriptures, based on practical scientific investigation&quot;. The society published a magazine, &quot;The Earth Not a Globe Review&quot;, which sold for twopence and remained active well into the early 20th century. A flat Earth journal, &quot;Earth: a Monthly Magazine of Sense and Science&quot;, was published between 1901 and 1904, edited by Lady Blount. She held that the Bible was the unquestionable authority on the natural world and argued that one could not be a Christian and believe the Earth is a globe. Well-known members included E. W. Bullinger of the Trinitarian Bible Society, Edward Haughton, senior moderator in natural science in Trinity College Dublin and an archbishop. She repeated Rowbotham&#x27;s experiments, generating some counter-experiments, but interest declined after the First World War. The Universal Zetetic Society &quot;was revived under different names over the years—in 1956, 1972, and 2004&quot;. The movement gave rise to several books that argued for a flat, stationary Earth, including &quot;Terra Firma&quot; by David Wardlaw Scott.

Other notable flat Earthers from this time period include:
* William Carpenter, a printer originally from Greenwich, was a supporter of Rowbotham. Carpenter published &quot;Theoretical Astronomy Examined and Exposed – Proving the Earth not a Globe&quot; in eight parts from 1864 under the name &quot;Common Sense&quot;. He later emigrated to Baltimore, where he published &quot;One Hundred Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe&quot; in 1885. He wrote: &quot;There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the level of the sea without falling more than a few feet – notably, the Nile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth&#x27;s convexity. It is, therefore, a reasonable proof that Earth is not a globe&quot;, as well as: &quot;If the Earth were a globe, a small model globe would be the very best – because the truest – thing for the navigator to take to sea with him. But such a thing as that is not known: with such a toy as a guide, the mariner would wreck his ship, of a certainty! This is a proof that Earth is not a globe.&quot;
* John Jasper, an American slave turned prolific preacher, and friend of Carpenter&#x27;s, echoed his friend&#x27;s sentiments in his most famous sermon &quot;The Sun do move&quot;, preached over 250 times, always by invitation. In a written account of his sermon, published in &quot;The Richmond Whig&quot; of March 19, 1878, Jasper says he would frequently cite the verse &quot;I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth&quot; and follow up by arguing: &quot;So we are living on a four-cornered earth; then, my friends, will you tell me how in the name of God can an earth with four corners be round!&quot; In the same article he argued: &quot;if the earth is like others say, who hold a different theory, peopled on the other side, those people would be obliged to walk on the ground with their feet upward like flies on the ceiling of a room&quot;.
* In Brockport, New York, in 1887, M. C. Flanders argued the case of a flat Earth for three nights against two scientific gentlemen defending sphericity. Five townsmen chosen as judges voted unanimously for a flat Earth at the end. The case was reported in the &quot;Brockport Democrat&quot;.
* Joseph W. Holden of Maine, a former justice of the peace, gave numerous lectures in New England and lectured on flat-Earth theory at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His fame stretched to North Carolina, where the Statesville &quot;Semi-weekly Landmark&quot; recorded at his death in 1900: &quot;We hold to the doctrine that the Earth is flat ourselves and we regret exceedingly to learn that one of our members is dead.&quot;
* In 1898, during his solo circumnavigation of the world, Joshua Slocum encountered a group of flat-Earthers in Durban, South Africa. Three Boers, one of them a clergyman, presented Slocum with a pamphlet in which they set out to prove that the world was flat. Paul Kruger, President of the Transvaal Republic, advanced the same view: &quot;You don&#x27;t mean &quot;round&quot; the world, it is impossible! You mean &quot;in&quot; the world. Impossible!&quot;
* From 1915 to 1942 Wilbur Glenn Voliva, who in 1906 took over the Christian Catholic Church, a Pentecostal sect that established a utopian community in Zion, Illinois, preached flat Earth doctrine. He used a photograph of a stretch of the shoreline at Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, taken above the waterline to prove his point. When the airship &quot;Italia&quot; disappeared on an expedition to the North Pole in 1928, he warned the world&#x27;s press that it had sailed over the edge of the world. He offered a $5000 award ($98,590 in 2022 terms) for proving that the Earth is not flat, under his own conditions. Teaching a globular Earth was banned in the Zion schools, and the message was transmitted on his WCBD radio station.
* Along with those who followed him, Frank Cherry (died 1963), the founder of the Black Hebrew Israelite religion, taught the existence of a flat Earth &quot;surrounded by three layers of heaven.&quot;

==International Flat Earth Research Society==
In 1956, Samuel Shenton created the International Flat Earth Research Society, better known as the &quot;Flat Earth Society&quot;, as a successor to the Universal Zetetic Society, running it as &quot;organising secretary&quot; from his home in Dover, England. Given Shenton&#x27;s interest in alternative science and technology, the emphasis on religious arguments was less than in the predecessor society. This was just before the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik; he responded: &quot;Would sailing round the Isle of Wight prove that it were spherical? It is just the same for those satellites.&quot;

His primary aim was to reach children before they were convinced about a spherical Earth. Despite plenty of publicity, the space race eroded Shenton&#x27;s support in Britain until 1967, when he started to gain attention during the Apollo program. When satellite images showed Earth as a sphere, Shenton remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye&quot;. Later asked about similar photographs taken by astronauts, he attributed curvature to the use of wide-angle lens, adding, &quot;It&#x27;s a deception of the public and it isn&#x27;t right&quot;.

In 1969, Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman, a Polytechnic of East London lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society after attempts to convince Eden Thomas, a former chairman, to take on the role; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton&#x27;s death, when he added most of Shenton&#x27;s library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish.

Shenton died in 1971. Charles K. Johnson, a correspondent from California, inherited part of Shenton&#x27;s library from Shenton&#x27;s wife; he incorporated and became president of the International Flat Earth Research Society of America and Covenant People&#x27;s Church in California. Over the next three decades, under his leadership, the Flat Earth Society grew to a reported 3,500 members.

Johnson spent years examining the studies of flat- and round-Earth theories and proposed evidence of a conspiracy against flat Earth: &quot;The idea of a spinning globe is only a conspiracy of error that Moses, Columbus, and FDR all fought...&quot; His article was published in the magazine &quot;Science Digest&quot; in 1980. It goes on to state: &quot;If it is a sphere, the surface of a large body of water must be curved. The Johnsons have checked the surfaces of Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea without detecting any curvature.&quot;

Johnson issued many publications and handled all membership applications. The most famous publication was &quot;Flat Earth News,&quot; a quarterly, four-page tabloid. Johnson paid for these publications through annual member dues costing US$6 to US$10 over the course of his leadership. Johnson cited the Bible for his beliefs, and he saw scientists as pulling a hoax which would replace religion with science.

The Flat Earth Society&#x27;s most recent planet model is that humanity lives on a disc, with the North Pole at its centre and a wall of ice, Antarctica, at the outer edge. The resulting map resembles the symbol of the United Nations, which Johnson used as evidence for his position. In this model, the Sun and Moon are each in diameter.

The Flat Earth Society recruited members by speaking against the US government and all its agencies, particularly NASA. Much of the society&#x27;s literature in its early days focused on interpreting the Bible to mean that the Earth is flat, although they did try to offer scientific explanations and evidence.

===Criticism===
Eugenie Scott called the group an example of &quot;extreme Biblical-literalist theology: The earth is flat because the Bible says it is flat, regardless of what science tells us&quot;.

According to some flat Earthers, the Flat Earth Society is a government-controlled organization whose true purpose is to make ridiculous claims about flat Earth and therefore discredit the flat Earth movement.

===Decline and relaunch===
According to Charles K. Johnson, the membership of the group rose to 3,500 under his leadership but began to decline after a fire at his house in 1997 which destroyed all of the records and contacts of the society&#x27;s members. Johnson&#x27;s wife, who helped manage the membership database, died shortly thereafter. Johnson himself died on 19 March 2001.

In 2004, Daniel Shenton (not related to Samuel) resurrected the Flat Earth Society, basing it around a web-based discussion forum. In the late 1990s, Thomas Dolby&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;The Flat Earth&quot; inspired Shenton to look into the Flat Earth Society, and he came to believe in its ideas. He believes that no one has provided proof that the world is not flat. This eventually led to the official relaunch of the society in October 2009, and the creation of a new website, featuring a public collection of flat Earth literature and a wiki. Moreover, the society began accepting new members for the first time since 2001. Dolby accepted Shenton&#x27;s offer of membership number 00001, although he does not believe the Earth is flat. , over 500 people had become members.

In 2013, part of this society broke away to form a new web-based group also featuring a forum and wiki.

==By country==
===Canada===
Flat Earth Society of Canada was established on 8 November 1970 by philosopher Leo Ferrari, writer Raymond Fraser and poet Alden Nowlan; and was active until 1984. Its archives are held at the University of New Brunswick.

Calling themselves &quot;planoterrestrialists&quot;, their aims were quite different from other flat Earth societies. They claimed a prevailing problem of the new technological age was the willingness of people to accept theories &quot;on blind faith and to reject the evidence of their own senses.&quot; The parodic intention of the Society appeared in the writings of Ferrari, as he attributed everything from gender to racial inequality on the globularist and the spherical Earth model. Ferrari also claimed to have nearly fallen off &quot;the Edge&quot; of the Earth at Brimstone Head on Fogo Island.

Ferrari was interviewed as an &quot;expert&quot; in the 1990 flat Earth mockumentary &quot;In Search of the Edge&quot; by Pancake Productions (a reference to the expression &quot;as flat as a pancake&quot;). In the accompanying study guide, Ferrari is outed as a &quot;globularist&quot;, a nonce word for someone who believes the Earth is spherical. The real intent of the film, which was part-funded by the Ontario Arts Council and National Film Board of Canada, was to promote schoolchildren&#x27;s critical thinking and media literacy by &quot;[attempting] to prove in convincing fashion, something everyone knew to be false.&quot;

====Relaunch====
Multi-media artist Kay Burns re-created the Flat Earth Society of Canada as an art project with her alter ego Iris Taylor as its president. Burns created an installation entitled the Museum of the Flat Earth, which included some artefacts from the 1970 group. It was exhibited in 2016 at the Flat Earth Outpost Café in Shoal Bay, Newfoundland.

===Italy===
In Italy, there are no centralised societies on flat Earth. However, since the 2010s, small groups of conspiracy theorists, who carry out meetings, started to emerge and to spread flat Earth theories. Among these are Calogero Greco, Albino Galuppini and Agostino Favari, who in 2018–2019 organised several meetings in Palermo, Sicily, with an entry price of €20.

Among their claims, some include:
* NASA is similar to Disneyland and that astronauts are actors.
* The April 2019 photo of the supermassive black hole at the core of the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 is fake.
* The proof Earth is flat can be demonstrated with a filled bottle where, if placed horizontally, water never curves.

In addition to these, it is their common belief that the United States has a plan to create in Europe a new America open to everyone, where the only value is consumerism and that George Soros commands a satanic globalist conspiracy. They reject the past existence of dinosaurs, the Darwinian theory of evolution, and the authority of the scientific community, claiming scientists are Freemasons.

Former leader of the Five Star Movement political party Beppe Grillo showed interest in the group, admitting to admiring their free speech spirit and to wanting to participate at the May 2019 conference. However, Grillo did not appear.

==Internet-era resurgence==
In November 2017 &quot;more than five hundred people ... paid as much as $249 each to attend &quot;the first-ever Flat Earth Conference&quot;, in a suburb of Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S. According to a 2018 YouGov opinion poll, &quot;just 66% of millennials firmly believe&quot; that the earth is round, with celebrities (rapper B.o.B., basketball players Kyrie Irving, Wilson Chandler, Draymond Green) advocating for flatness.

===Sociological explanations for counterfactual beliefs===

In the Information Age, the availability of communications technology and social media such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easy for individuals, famous or not, to spread disinformation and attract others to erroneous ideas. One of the topics that has flourished in this environment is that of the flat Earth.
These sites have made it easier for like-minded theorists to connect with one another and mutually reinforce their beliefs. Social media has had a &quot;levelling effect&quot;, in that experts have less sway in the public mind than they used to.

YouTube has faced criticism for allowing the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories through its platform, specifically, flat Earth. In 2019, YouTube stated that it was making changes in its software to reduce the distribution of videos based on conspiracy theories including flat Earth. Professor Asheley Landrum &quot;called on scientists themselves to fight back by using YouTube as a platform to communicate their own work. &quot;We don&#x27;t want YouTube to be full of videos saying here are all these reasons the Earth is flat,&quot; she said. &quot;We need other videos saying here&#x27;s why those reasons aren&#x27;t real and here&#x27;s a bunch of ways you can research it for yourself.&quot;&quot;

In the documentary &quot;Behind the Curve&quot; (2018) (which follows prominent modern flat-Earthers including Mark Sargent and Patricia Steere, as well as astrophysicists and psychologists who attempt to explain the growing fad), professor of psychiatry Joe Pierre offers as explanations: the Dunning-Kruger effect (the phenomenon whereby ignorance in a given field makes people unable to recognize their own ignorance or lack of ability in that field); misunderstandings of simple observation; pseudoscientific practices which fail to separate reliable from unreliable conclusions; and a progressive divergence from reality that starts with a belief that conventional information sources and the government cannot be trusted.

Out of the necessity to explain photographs of the earth in space, the observations of astronauts, why all major institutions such as governments, media outlets, schools, scientists, and airlines assert that the world is a sphere, etc., modern flat-Earthers very commonly embrace some form of conspiracy theory. As Darryle Marble, a speaker at the Flat Earth Conference, told his audience, after watching hours of YouTube conspiracy videos on Sandy Hook, 9/11, false flags, the Bilderbergers, Rothschilds, Illuminati – &quot;Each thing started to make that much more sense. I was already primed to receive the whole flat-Earth idea, because we had already come to the conclusion that we were being deceived about so many other things. So of course they would lie to us about this.&quot;

Conspiracy belief is often intertwined with conservative Christian belief. According to internet influencer Rob Skiba, &quot;the ultimate motivation&quot; of the (alleged) conspiracy of a round earth in space, &quot;many of us have come to believe, is hiding God.&quot; Reading the Bible, &quot;when you break down the text of what it represents, there&#x27;s no way you can get a spinning heliocentric globe out of anything in the Bible.&quot; (According to author Alan Burdick, &quot;in style and substance, the flat-Earth movement is a close cousin of creationism.&quot;)

They tend to not trust observations they have not made themselves, and often distrust or disagree with each other. Patricia Steere admitted in &quot;Behind the Curve&quot; that she wouldn&#x27;t believe an event like the Boston Marathon bombing was real unless she had gotten her own leg blown off. Flat Earth believers in the documentary also professed belief in conspiracy theories about vaccines, genetically modified organisms, chemtrails, 9/11, and transgender people; some said dinosaurs and evolution were also fake, and that heliocentrism is a form of Sun worship.

The scientific experts in &quot;Behind the Curve&quot; pointed to confirmation bias as a way to maintain a counterfactual belief, by cherry-picking only supporting evidence, and dismissing any disconfirming evidence as part of the purported global conspiracy.

Some flat Earth believers, such as authors Zen Garcia and Edward Hendrie, cite the Christian Bible as evidence. Some critics of the flat Earth idea, such as astronomer Danny R. Faulkner, are young Earth creationists and attempt to explain away the Bible&#x27;s supposed flat Earth language.

On 3 May 2018, Steven Novella analysed the modern belief in a flat Earth, and concluded that, despite what most people think about the subject, the believers are being sincere in their belief that the Earth is flat, and are not &quot;just saying that to wind us up&quot;. He stated that:
The British sceptical activist Michael Marshall attended the annual Flat Earth UK Convention on 27–29 April 2018 and noted disagreement on several views among believers in a flat Earth. To Marshall, one of the most telling moments at the convention was the &quot;Flat Earth Addiction&quot; test that was based on a checklist used to determine whether someone is in a cult, without the convention attendees realising the possibility of themselves being in a cult.

===Beliefs===
Based on the speakers at the 2018 UK&#x27;s Flat Earth UK Convention, believers in a flat Earth vary widely in their views. While most agree upon a disc-shaped Earth, some are convinced the Earth is diamond-shaped. Furthermore, while most believers do not believe in outer space and none believe humans have ever travelled there, they vary widely in their views of the universe. (Flat Earth International Conferences, organized by Robbie Davidson, are unaffiliated with the Flat Earth Society. According to Davidson, the &quot;Earth is ... a stationary plane, with the sun, moon, and stars inside a dome&quot;, while the Flat Earth Society promotes a model in which Earth is &quot;a disk flying through space&quot;, and which Davidson finds &quot;incredibly ridiculous&quot;.)

Filmmakers of &quot;Behind the Curve&quot; attended another flat Earth conference at which a substantial number of people believed the Earth was an infinite plane, potentially with more continents beyond the purported circular ice wall of Antarctica. 
Members of the Flat Earth Society and other flat-Earthers claim that NASA and other government agencies conspire to fabricate evidence that the Earth is spherical. According to the most widely spread version of current flat-Earth theory, NASA is guarding the Antarctic ice wall that surrounds Earth. Flat-Earthers argue that NASA manipulates and fabricates its satellite images, based on observations that the color of the oceans changes from image to image and that continents seem to be in different places. The publicly perpetuated image is kept up through a large-scale practice of &quot;compartmentalization&quot;, according to which only a select number of individuals have knowledge about the truth.

Research by Carlos Diaz Ruiz and Tomas Nilsson on the arguments that flat Earthers wield, shows three factions, each one subscribing to its own set of beliefs.
The first faction subscribes to a faith-based conflict in which atheists use science to suppress the Christian faith. Their argument is that atheists use pseudo-science – evolution, Big Bang, and the round Earth – to make people believe that God is an abstract idea, not real. Instead, their arguments use the Scripture – word-by-word – to support an argument that enables God to really exist. This faction frames flat-Earth arguments as revelatory. (For example, a literal interpretation of Revelation 7 -- &quot;I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth ...&quot;—indicates the earth must have four corners.) This is in spite of the fact that a circular flat earth would also not have corners, contradicting the central model of flat earth. This contradiction seems to imply that god created a 2D quadrilateral or 3D tetrahedral earth. 

The second faction believes in an overarching conspiracy for knowledge suppression. Building upon the premise that knowledge is power, the flat Earth conspiracy argues that a shadowy group of &quot;elites&quot; control knowledge to remain in power. In their view, lying about the fundamental nature of the Earth primes the population to believe a host of other conspiracies. This faction frames flat-Earth arguments as liberatory.

The third faction believes that knowledge is personal and experiential. They are dismissive of knowledge that comes from authoritative sources, especially book knowledge. This faction would like to find out themselves whether the Earth truly is round or flat. Because they distrust book knowledge and mathematical proof, this faction believes that the Earth is flat because their observations and lived experiences make it appear as if we live on a flat surface. This faction frames flat-Earth arguments as experimental.

Fellow flat earthers are not exempt from distrust and belief that they may be in cahoots with round earthers. In &quot;Behind the Curve&quot;, conference attendees were warned against attending by Math Powerland a.k.a. Matt Boylan, who posted videos alleging others were working for the CIA or Warner Brothers. At the 2017 Flat Earth conference:

===Social and experimental activities of skeptics and believers===
Organisations sceptical of fringe beliefs have occasionally performed tests to demonstrate the local curvature of the Earth. One of these, conducted by members of the Independent Investigations Group of the Center for Inquiry, at the Salton Sea on 10 June 2018 was attended also by supporters of a flat Earth, and the encounter between the two groups was recorded by the National Geographic Explorer. This experiment successfully demonstrated the curvature of the Earth via the disappearance over distance of boat-based and shore-based targets. IIG founder Jim Underdown reported that the flat Earth supporters in attendance immediately rejected the results, denying the validity of the demonstration after the fact, and the discussion degenerated into tangents about Moon landing conspiracy theories and alleged NASA cover-ups.

The 2018 documentary &quot;Behind the Curve&quot; followed two groups of American flat Earth believers who were attempting to gather first-hand empirical proof for that belief. One group from the YouTube show GlobeBusters used a ring laser gyroscope in an attempt to show the Earth was not rotating. Instead, they detected the actual 15-degree-per-hour rotation of the Earth, a measurement they dismissed as corrupted by the device somehow picking up the rotation of the &quot;firmament&quot;. Another group used lasers in an attempt to show a several-mile stretch of water is perfectly flat by measuring the distance between the water level and the laser beam along three vertical posts. They were unable to align the beam as they expected to because the surface of the still water was in fact bent by several feet over the distance measured; the experiment was dismissed as inconclusive.

&quot;Behind the Curve&quot; illustrated how flat Earth believers rely on poorly-verified claims. Mark Sargent claimed to have watched flightaware.com for a very long time to check if any flights traveled between continents in the Southern Hemisphere, which in his disc model would be much further apart than they are on the globe. He stated that he saw no such flights, and took this as evidence for the disc model. Caltech astrophysicist Hannalore Gerling-Dunsmore went to the site and immediately found flights that contradicted Sargent&#x27;s claims.

The solar eclipse of 21 August 2017 gave rise to numerous YouTube videos purporting to show how the details of the eclipse prove the Earth is flat.

In 2017, &quot;the Tunisian and Arab scientific and educational world&quot; had a scandal when a Ph.D. student at the University of Sfax in Tunisia submitted a Ph.D. dissertation &quot;declaring Earth to be flat, unmoving, young (only 13,500 years of age), and the centre of the universe&quot;. In 2018, astronomer Yaël Nazé analyzed the controversy over the dissertation. The dissertation, which had not been approved by the committee overseeing environmental studies theses, had been made public and denounced in 2017 by Hafedh Ateb, a founder of the Tunisian Astronomical Society, on his Facebook page.

In March 2019, social media personality Logan Paul released a satirical documentary film about the flat Earth called &quot;FLAT EARTH: To The Edge And Back&quot;.

On December 14, 2024, retired businessman and pastor Will Duffy paid to bring believers in the concept of a flat earth to Union Glacier Camp in Antarctica for them to witness day-long illumination. While his guests had to concede they witnessed the midnight sun in Antarctica, not all of them accepted on the spot that the Earth is a sphere.
==== Mike Hughes ====

Mike Hughes, a daredevil/stuntman, planned to use a homebuilt crewed rocket to reach outer space.
In a practice flight on 22 February 2020, the early deployment and separation of the return parachute allowed his rocket to fall unimpeded from an altitude of several hundred feet, killing him instantly.

After Hughes&#x27; death, his public relations representative Darren Shuster stated that Hughes &quot;didn&#x27;t believe in flat Earth&quot; and that it was &quot;a PR stunt&quot; to get publicity, while Michael Linn, who worked on the documentary &quot;Rocketman: Mad Mike&#x27;s Mission to Prove the Flat-Earth&quot;, said that Hughes&#x27; belief appeared genuine.

===Social consequences and responses===
&quot;Behind the Curve&quot;″s filmmakers spoke with several people who said that as a result of their flat Earth beliefs they had lost romantic partners and no longer spoke to many friends and family. One said he was tired of being told he was an idiot. The Facebook group Flat Earth Match is a dating site used by some to find romantic partners who share these beliefs. Experts pointed out that after social ties to people outside the flat Earth community are lost, one consequence of abandoning the flat Earth belief would be loss of all remaining relationships.

Caltech physicist Spiros Michaelakis stated that instead of denigrating flat Earthers, scientists should do a better job of teaching scientific facts. Various scientific and medical experts in the documentary supported improving scientific literacy and avoiding marginalization of flat Earthers. They pointed out that people who distrust all of science, including truths about vaccines, evolution, and climate change, would make poorly informed-decisions, and that people who do not exercise the skill of critical thinking can be easily manipulated. They also pointed out that some believers were motivated to spread false ideas, and that because they are unconstrained by facts they can mutate and become less harmless than a mere belief about the shape of the Earth.

=== Prevalence ===
In 2020, it was reported that based on polling by Datafolha, 7% of Brazilians believed in a flat Earth. A 2018 YouGov poll found that around 4% of the population of the United States believed in flat Earth, while the POLES 2021 Survey found around 10% of the United States population believed that the Earth is flat. A 2019 YouGov survey found that around 3% of British people supported flat Earth.

==The term &quot;flat-Earther&quot;==
The term &quot;flat-Earth-man&quot;, used in a derogatory sense to mean anyone who holds ridiculously antiquated or impossible views, predates the more compact &quot;flat-earther&quot;. It was recorded in 1908: &quot;Fewer votes than one would have thought possible for any human candidate, were he even a flat-earth-man.&quot; According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first use of the term &quot;flat-Earther&quot; was in 1934 in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine: &quot;Without being a bigoted flat-earther, [Mercator] perceived the nuisance ... of fiddling about with globes ... in order to discover the South Seas.&quot;

<doc id="103127" wikidata="Q850362" url="?curid=103127" title="Brute-force search">
<text>In computer science, brute-force search or exhaustive search, also known as generate and test, is a very general problem-solving technique and algorithmic paradigm that consists of systematically checking all possible candidates for whether or not each candidate satisfies the problem&#x27;s statement.

A brute-force algorithm that finds the divisors of a natural number &quot;n&quot; would enumerate all integers from 1 to n, and check whether each of them divides &quot;n&quot; without remainder. A brute-force approach for the eight queens puzzle would examine all possible arrangements of 8 pieces on the 64-square chessboard and for each arrangement, check whether each (queen) piece can attack any other.
While a brute-force search is simple to implement and will always find a solution if it exists, implementation costs are proportional to the number of candidate solutionswhich in many practical problems tends to grow very quickly as the size of the problem increases (§Combinatorial explosion). Therefore, brute-force search is typically used when the problem size is limited, or when there are problem-specific heuristics that can be used to reduce the set of candidate solutions to a manageable size. The method is also used when the simplicity of implementation is more important than processing speed.

This is the case, for example, in critical applications where any errors in the algorithm would have very serious consequences or when using a computer to prove a mathematical theorem. Brute-force search is also useful as a baseline method when benchmarking other algorithms or metaheuristics. Indeed, brute-force search can be viewed as the simplest metaheuristic. Brute force search should not be confused with backtracking, where large sets of solutions can be discarded without being explicitly enumerated (as in the textbook computer solution to the eight queens problem above). The brute-force method for finding an item in a tablenamely, check all entries of the latter, sequentiallyis called linear search.

==Implementing the brute-force search==

===Basic algorithm===
In order candidate for &quot;P&quot; after the current one &quot;c&quot;.
# &quot;valid&quot; (&quot;P&quot;, &quot;c&quot;): check whether candidate &quot;c&quot; is a solution for &quot;P&quot;.
# &quot;output&quot; (&quot;P&quot;, &quot;c&quot;): use the solution &quot;c&quot; of &quot;P&quot; as appropriate to the application.
The &quot;next&quot; procedure must also tell when there are no more candidates for the instance &quot;P&quot;, after the current one &quot;c&quot;. A convenient way to do that is to return a &quot;null candidate&quot;, some conventional data value Λ that is distinct from any real candidate. Likewise the &quot;first&quot; procedure should return Λ if there are no candidates at all for the instance &quot;P&quot;. The brute-force method is then expressed by the algorithm 
 &quot;c&quot; ← &quot;first&quot;(&quot;P&quot;)
 while &quot;c&quot; ≠ Λ do
 if &quot;valid&quot;(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) then
 &quot;output&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
 &quot;c&quot; ← &quot;next&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
 end while
For example, when looking for the divisors of an integer &quot;n&quot;, the instance data &quot;P&quot; is the number &quot;n&quot;. The call &quot;first&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) should return the integer 1 if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1, or Λ otherwise; the call &quot;next&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) should return &quot;c&quot; + 1 if &quot;c&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, and Λ otherwise; and &quot;valid&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) should return true if and only if &quot;c&quot; is a divisor of &quot;n&quot;. (In fact, if we choose Λ to be &quot;n&quot; + 1, the tests &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1 and &quot;c&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; are unnecessary.)The brute-force search algorithm above will call &quot;output&quot; for every candidate that is a solution to the given instance &quot;P&quot;. The algorithm is easily modified to stop after finding the first solution, or a specified number of solutions; or after testing a specified number of candidates, or after spending a given amount of CPU time.

==Combinatorial explosion==
The main disadvantage of the brute-force method is that, for many real-world problems, the number of natural candidates is prohibitively large. For instance, if we look for the divisors of a number as described above, the number of candidates tested will be the given number &quot;n&quot;. So if &quot;n&quot; has sixteen decimal digits, say, the search will require executing at least 1015 computer instructions, which will take several days on a typical PC. If &quot;n&quot; is a random 64-bit natural number, which has about 19 decimal digits on the average, the search will take about 10 years. This steep growth in the number of candidates, as the size of the data increases, occurs in all sorts of problems. For instance, if we are seeking a particular rearrangement of 10 letters, then we have 10! = 3,628,800 candidates to consider, which a typical PC can generate and test in less than one second. However, adding one more letterwhich is only a 10% increase in the data sizewill multiply the number of candidates by 11, a 1000% increase. For 20 letters, the number of candidates is 20!, which is about 2.4×1018 or 2.4 quintillion; and the search will take about 10 years. This unwelcome phenomenon is commonly called the combinatorial explosion, or the curse of dimensionality.

One example of a case where combinatorial complexity leads to solvability limit is in solving chess. Chess is not a solved game. In 2005, all chess game endings with six pieces or less were solved, showing the result of each position if played perfectly. It took ten more years to complete the tablebase with one more chess piece added, thus completing a 7-piece tablebase. Adding one more piece to a chess ending (thus making an 8-piece tablebase) is considered intractable due to the added combinatorial complexity.

==Speeding up brute-force searches==
One way to speed up a brute-force algorithm is to reduce the search space, that is, the set of candidate solutions, by using heuristics specific to the problem class. For example, in the eight queens problem the challenge is to place eight queens on a standard chessboard so that no queen attacks any other. Since each queen can be placed in any of the 64 squares, in principle there are 648 = 281,474,976,710,656 possibilities to consider. However, because the queens are all alike, and that no two queens can be placed on the same square, the candidates are all possible ways of choosing of a set of 8 squares from the set all 64 squares; which means 64 choose 8 = 64!/(56!*8!) = 4,426,165,368 candidate solutionsabout 1/60,000 of the previous estimate. Further, no arrangement with two queens on the same row or the same column can be a solution. Therefore, we can further restrict the set of candidates to those arrangements.
As this example shows, a little bit of analysis will often lead to dramatic reductions in the number of candidate solutions, and may turn an intractable problem into a trivial one.

In some cases, the analysis may reduce the candidates to the set of all valid solutions; that is, it may yield an algorithm that directly enumerates all the desired solutions (or finds one solution, as appropriate), without wasting time with tests and the generation of invalid candidates. For example, for the problem &quot;find all integers between 1 and 1,000,000 that are evenly divisible by 417&quot; a naive brute-force solution would generate all integers in the range, testing each of them for divisibility. However, that problem can be solved much more efficiently by starting with 417 and repeatedly adding 417 until the number exceeds 1,000,000which takes only 2398 (= 1,000,000 ÷ 417) steps, and no tests.

==Reordering the search space==
In applications that require only one solution, rather than all solutions, the expected running time of a brute force search will often depend on the order in which the candidates are tested. As a general rule, one should test the most promising candidates first. For example, when searching for a proper divisor of a random number &quot;n&quot;, it is better to enumerate the candidate divisors in increasing order, from 2 to , than the other way aroundbecause the probability that &quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;c&quot; is 1/&quot;c&quot;. Moreover, the probability of a candidate being valid is often affected by the previous failed trials. For example, consider the problem of finding a 1 bit in a given 1000-bit string &quot;P&quot;. In this case, the candidate solutions are the indices 1 to 1000, and a candidate &quot;c&quot; is valid if &quot;P&quot;[&quot;c&quot;] = 1. Now, suppose that the first bit of &quot;P&quot; is equally likely to be 0 or 1, but each bit thereafter is equal to the previous one with 90% probability. If the candidates are enumerated in increasing order, 1 to 1000, the number &quot;t&quot; of candidates examined before success will be about 6, on the average. On the other hand, if the candidates are enumerated in the order 1,11,21,31...991,2,12,22,32 etc., the expected value of &quot;t&quot; will be only a little more than 2.More generally, the search space should be enumerated in such a way that the next candidate is most likely to be valid, &quot;given that the previous trials were not&quot;. So if the valid solutions are likely to be &quot;clustered&quot; in some sense, then each new candidate should be as far as possible from the previous ones, in that same sense. The converse holds, of course, if the solutions are likely to be spread out more uniformly than expected by chance.

==Alternatives to brute-force search==
There are many other search methods, or metaheuristics, which are designed to take advantage of various kinds of partial knowledge one may have about the solution. Heuristics can also be used to make an early cutoff of parts of the search. One example of this is the minimax principle for searching game trees, that eliminates many subtrees at an early stage in the search. In certain fields, such as language parsing, techniques such as chart parsing can exploit constraints in the problem to reduce an exponential complexity problem into a polynomial complexity problem. In many cases, such as in Constraint Satisfaction Problems, one can dramatically reduce the search space by means of Constraint propagation, that is efficiently implemented in Constraint programming languages. The search space for problems can also be reduced by replacing the full problem with a simplified version. For example, in computer chess, rather than computing the full minimax tree of all possible moves for the remainder of the game, a more limited tree of minimax possibilities is computed, with the tree being pruned at a certain number of moves, and the remainder of the tree being approximated by a static evaluation function.

==In cryptography==
In cryptography, a &quot;brute-force attack&quot; involves systematically checking all possible keys until the correct key is found. This strategy can in theory be used against any encrypted data (except a one-time pad) by an attacker who is unable to take advantage of any weakness in an encryption system that would otherwise make his or her task easier.

The key length used in the encryption determines the practical feasibility of performing a brute force attack, with longer keys exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones. Brute force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded, something that makes it more difficult for an attacker to recognise when he has cracked the code. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute force attack against it.

<text>South African Airways (SAA) is the flag carrier of South Africa. Founded in 1929 as Union Airways it later rebranded to South African Airways in 1934, the airline is headquartered in Airways Park at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and operates a hub-and-spoke network, serving 13 destinations in Africa and two intercontinental destinations to Perth, Australia and São Paulo, Brazil. The carrier joined Star Alliance in April 2006, making it the first African carrier to sign with one of the three major airline alliances.

The airline entered voluntary business rescue in December 2019 as a result of financial difficulties, and suspended all operations the following year. In June 2021, the South African government announced that SAA would be partially privatised in a Strategic Equity Partnership (SEP) transaction with the Takatso Consortium, which would hold a 51% controlling stake and 49% remaining with the State. After almost three years of protracted negotiations, the government terminated the SEP with Takatso, reverting back to the status quo of a 100% state-owned SAA. The South African Civil Aviation Authority confirmed on 4 August 2021 that SAA&#x27;s air operator&#x27;s certificate had been reissued with an approved fleet of eight aircraft.

The airline restarted operations on 23 September 2021, despite not having concluded the investment agreement with the proposed private partners. Nonetheless, SAA was recognised as the second best airline in Africa by Skytrax in 2021, despite not having flown a single scheduled flight for 18 months.

Since emerging from business rescue, SAA has grown steadily, with a fleet of 20 aircraft, 15 destinations and 2000 employees.

==History==
===Formation and early years===

South African Airways was formed on 1 February 1934 following the acquisition of Union Airways by the South African government. Forty staff members, along with one de Havilland DH.60 Gypsy Moth, one de Havilland DH.80A Puss Moth, three Junkers F.13s and a leased Junkers F13 and Junkers A50 were among the acquired aircraft. Upon acquisition, the government changed the airline&#x27;s name to &quot;South African Airways&quot;. It then came under control of the South African Railways and Harbours Administration (now Transnet). Charter operations started that year. On 1 February the following year, the carrier acquired Suidwes Lugdiens / South West Airways (now Air Namibia), which had since 1932 been providing a weekly air-mail service between Windhoek and Kimberley. During this time, SAA ordered three Junkers Ju 52/3m aircraft, which were delivered in October 1934 and entered service 10 days later. These aircraft were configured to carry 14 passengers, along with four crew. They enabled thrice-weekly Durban–Johannesburg services, with weekly services on the Durban–East London–Port Elizabeth–George/Mossel Bay–Cape Town route. On 1 July 1935, SAA moved its operations to Rand Airport as it became increasingly obvious that Johannesburg would become the country&#x27;s aviation hub, which coincided with the launching of Rand–Durban–East London–Port Elizabeth–Cape Town services. From July the following year a weekly Rand–Kimberley–Beaufort West–Cape Town service commenced; in April 1936, all Rand–Cape Town services were taken over from Imperial Airways. A fourth Ju 52/3m soon joined the fleet.

Orders for a further ten Ju 52/3m aircraft, along with eighteen Junkers Ju 86s and seven Airspeed Envoys (four for the airline and three for the South African Air Force) were placed. This raised the number of Ju 52s to fourteen, although three older models were sold when deliveries of the newer Ju 52s began. The airline experienced a rapid expansion during this time, but also suffered its first accident; one of the newly delivered Ju 52s crashed after takeoff from Rand Airport in July 1937, with one reported fatality. From 1 February 1934 until the start of World War II, SAA carried 118,822 passengers, 3,278 tonnes of airmail and 248 tonnes of cargo, which were served by 418 employees. On 24 May 1940, all operations were suspended.

Following World War II, frequencies were increased and more routes were opened, which necessitated the conversion of three South African Air Force Envoys to passenger layout. These aircraft would prove to be unsuitable for passenger and cargo services and were returned to the SAAF after the arrival of the Junkers Ju 86s. The main aircraft of SAA in the 1930s was the Junkers Ju 52. Other types used in the 1930s included eighteen Junkers Ju 86s, which served from 1937 onwards.

The slow growth continued during the 1940s, though the airline was effectively closed for the duration of World War II. In 1944, SAA began operating 28 Lockheed Lodestars to restart domestic services and by 1948 SAA operating nineteen examples. These were withdrawn in 1955.

On 10 November 1945, SAA achieved a longtime company goal by operating a route to Europe when an Avro York landed in Bournemouth, England, after the long flight from Palmietfontein Airport near Johannesburg. These were replaced by the Douglas DC-4 from 1946 onwards, which in turn was replaced by the Lockheed Constellation on international routes in 1950. Also of note in the postwar era was the DC-3 Dakota, of which eight served with SAA, the last example being withdrawn as late as 1970.

===Growth: 1946–1952===
On 10 November 1945, the airline introduced its first intercontinental service, the 3-day &quot;Springbok Service&quot;, operated by the Avro York, which was routed Palmietfontein–Nairobi–Khartoum–Cairo–Castel Benito–Hurn Bournemouth. A weekly service was initially flown, but this later increased to 6 times weekly due to high passenger demand. The Douglas DC-4 Skymaster debuted with SAA in May 1946 between Johannesburg and Cape Town, which coincided with the introduction of the Douglas DC-3 on the Johannesburg–Durban route.

From 1946, passengers and cargo carried increased, along with the size of SAA&#x27;s fleet and staff. As the Skymasters arrived, out went the Avro Yorks, back to BOAC. Air hostesses were introduced in September 1946: at first on domestic routes, then on &quot;Springbok Services&quot;. The two de Havilland Doves were introduced at the end of the year; these aircraft were utilised on internal services for a short time and were sold within a few years. The 28-seat Vickers Viking served the airline briefly, before being sold to British European Airways.

Palmietfontein Airport replaced Rand Airport as SAA&#x27;s hub in 1948. In June 1948, SAA began to show films on its Skymaster aircraft. SAA received four Lockheed Constellations, its first pressurised aircraft, in August 1950. They provided scheduled service to London&#x27;s Heathrow airport. Initially, the route from Johannesburg was flown via Nairobi, Khartoum and Rome. The Constellation&#x27;s higher speed and longer range enabled fewer stops and greatly reduced the flying time to London.

===The Jet Age: 1953–1973===
The jet age arrived in South Africa on 3 May 1952 when a BOAC de Havilland Comet arrived in Palmietfontein after a 24-hour journey from England with five refuelling stops en route. SAA chartered two Comets from the British airline on 4 October 1953, when Comet G-ANAV left London for Johannesburg. On the same day, &quot;Tourist Class&quot; was introduced on the 58-seat Lockheed Constellation used on the Springbok Service. The two chartered aircraft sported both BOAC and SAA titles and logos, but were operated by SAA crews.

In 1956 Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens introduced the Douglas DC-7B, capable of long-range operations and then probably the fastest piston-engine airliner in the world. SAA exploited the aircraft&#x27;s performance by introducing it between Johannesburg and London with only one fuelling stop at Khartoum. This was known as the &quot;East Coast express&quot;, taking 21 hours to complete, versus BOAC&#x27;s inaugural Comet flight between the two cities of 24 hours. This later became the &quot;West Coast express&quot; when the at Khartoum was transferred to Kano, Nigeria, resulting in a shortened flying of 18 hours. The fortnightly Wallaby Route, routed Johannesburg–Mauritius–Cocos Islands–Perth, Australia, started in November 1957.

After a host of accidents involving SAA&#x27;s and other airlines&#x27; Comets, the airline ordered three Boeing 707-320 &quot;Intercontinentals&quot; on 21 February 1958, with the first delivered on 1 July 1960. Three months after arrival, on 1 October 1960, the Boeing 707 was deployed on the airline&#x27;s flagship &quot;Springbok Service&quot;, trimming the flying time to London to 13 hours. Other changes brought about by the 707 were a livery change, to an orange tail with blue and white markings, as well as improved comfort, range and speed. A 707 replaced the DC-7B on the Wallaby Route in 1967; Cocos Islands was dropped, while Sydney became the terminus. Flights to New York, via Rio de Janeiro, started on 23 February 1969 using a 707. The first 707 of SAA landed in Europe in October 1961 with a nine-hour flight to Athens.

The jets arrived during a period when most African countries, except SA&#x27;s neighbours, denied South African airlines the use of their airspace, necessitating long detours. In 1967 the Skymasters, Constellations and DC-7Bs were being retired, replaced by the Boeing 727 trijet the following year to complement the Boeing 707. The choice of 727 was based on the geography of the destinations to which it would fly; for example Johannesburg is high and hot, where the 727&#x27;s wings and other technical capabilities enable it to operate out of such airports.

On 13 March 1968, SAA ordered five Boeing 747-200Bs. The first, &quot;Lebombo&quot; (registered as ZS-SAN), was delivered on 22 October 1971 after a 3-stop flight from Seattle. It was placed into service in December and proved very popular. SAA eventually operated 23 brand-new &quot;Jumbo Jets&quot;, including the −200M (first delivered in 1980), −300 (1983), −400, and the long-range Boeing 747SP, first delivered on 18–19 March 1976, with a nonstop delivery flight of ZS-SPA from Everett, Washington, USA to Cape Town. The 747SP, especially, was acquired to overcome the refusal of many countries to allow SAA to use their airspace by exploiting its long-range capabilities, as well as to serve lower-density routes which were unsuited to the 747-200. Six were delivered starting 19 March 1976. As above, to demonstrate the 747SP&#x27;s performance, the first one was delivered from Seattle to Cape Town non-stop, an airliner distance record that stood until 1989. The first 747SP arrived in South Africa on 19 March 1976. As the 747 entered service, its smaller siblings, the 707s, were converted to combi (passenger/cargo) configurations and high-density seating. All of SAA&#x27;s Vickers Viscounts were sold by March 1972 after being replaced by Boeing 737s.

===Expansion: 1974–1983===

SAA opened a route to Asia, with Boeing 707 flights to Hong Kong via an intermediate stop at the Seychelles Islands in June 1974. In 1980, SAA began nonstop flights to Taipei using a Boeing 747SP; Mauritius had earlier replaced the Seychelles for the Hong Kong service. South Africa became one of the few countries in the world to recognize the government of the Republic of China on Taiwan.

Because some African countries denied SAA the use of their airspace, SAA bypassed the &#x27;bulge&#x27; of Africa, usually via Ilha do Sal - a detour of almost . Another bypass was via Tel Aviv, which doubled the distance and flying time involved. European airlines were allowed to fly over Africa when flying to South Africa, usually via Nairobi and later nonstop.

On 26 December 1980, the last South African Airways Boeing 707 service was operated between Paris and Johannesburg. Its touchdown ended the 20-year career of the 707. The quadjet was replaced by the world&#x27;s first wide-body twinjet, the Airbus A300, which had entered revenue service in 1976. The 727s were eliminated by 1983, replaced by the more economical Boeing 737. When countries withdrew landing rights for SAA, the airline leased its aircraft and crews to Canada, Mauritius, Brazil, Morocco and Luxembourg.

===Effect of apartheid: 1985–1990===
Due to international opposition to apartheid during the 1980s, SAA&#x27;s offices were attacked. In Harare, Zimbabwe, its offices were badly damaged after protesters went on a rampage.

The US Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 banned all flights by South African–owned carriers, including SAA. In 1987, SAA&#x27;s services to Perth and Sydney in Australia were ended, in light of the Australian Government&#x27;s opposition to apartheid. 

In January 1992, the journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) reported that the SAA had allegedly confirmed that its passenger jets had carried cargo for Armscor, a South African arms manufacturer, in an attempt to circumvent a UN arms embargo placed on apartheid South Africa. On 28 November 1987, South African Airways Flight 295, a Boeing 747-200 Combi en route from Taipei to Johannesburg with a stopover in Mauritrius experienced a catastrophic in-flight fire in the cargo area, broke up in mid-air, and crashed into the Indian Ocean east of Mauritius, killing all 159 people on board. Ignition of an ammonium perchlorate cargo, a chemical used as a missile propellant, is theorized by forensic scientists to have caused the fire.

With the demise of apartheid in 1990, SAA started services to former and new destinations in Africa and Asia. On 1 June 1990, South African companies signed a domestic air travel deregulation act. Flights to New York City&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport resumed in November 1991 and SAA&#x27;s planes were able to fly for the first time over Egypt and Sudan, on 8 September. The airline launched flights to Milan on 1 June during the year, and services to Athens were re-introduced. Also, an interline with Aeroflot was established.

The first of SAA&#x27;s eight Boeing 747-400s, named &quot;Durban&quot;, arrived in South Africa on 19 January 1991. The airplane was unusual in that two different turbofan engines were operated. Six Rolls-Royce RB211-524H-powered examples were ordered; the other two, part of an unfulfilled Philippine Airlines order, had General Electric CF6-80C2B5Fs. Winglets, structural changes and fuel-efficient engines enabled these aircraft to fly non-stop from South Africa to the east coast of the United States. The arrival of Boeing&#x27;s newest jumbo jet perhaps overshadowed the acquisition by SAA of the world&#x27;s first commercial fly-by-wire airliner, the Airbus A320, to assist and enhance services within the country and on regional services. Boeing 767s arrived in August, 1993 and flew on African, Southern European and Middle Eastern routes. They were retired within ten years.

During 1992, SAA began flights to Miami with a Cape Town to Miami International Airport nonstop Boeing 747-400 route, and re-entered Australia, flying nonstop to Perth with a same-day return &quot;shuttle&quot; service to Sydney. This year also saw codesharing agreements with American Airlines and Air Tanzania. There were nonstop flights to Bangkok and Singapore; the latter were discontinued by 1996. The airline Alliance, a partnership between SAA, Uganda Airlines and Air Tanzania, also began. SAA greeted its passengers in four different languages during domestic flights: English, Zulu, Afrikaans and Sotho, while passengers on international flights were also greeted in the destination&#x27;s language.

On 24 April 1994, South African Express (SA Express), a feeder airline service of South African, began operating after a 3-year preparation process begun in 1991, when the regional airline was granted its operating license. SAA initially held a 20% stake in SA Express (Alliance Airline Holdings held 51%, SA Enterprises, 24.9% and Abyss Investments, 4.1%). SA Express took over some of SAA&#x27;s low-density domestic routes.

In 1995, Lufthansa started a codesharing agreement with SAA, and SAA commissioned Diefenbach Elkins and Herdbuoys to lead its change of image. SAA&#x27;s Voyager and American Airlines&#x27; AAdvantage frequent flier clubs joined.

As of April 1996, South African employed 11,100 people, of whom 3,100 were engineers. It owned and operated 48 aircraft, and served 34 destinations from its hubs at Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg.

===Rebranding: 1997–2005===

In 1997, SAA replaced the Springbok emblem and the old national colours of orange, white and blue with a new livery based upon the new national flag, with a sun motif. The airline&#x27;s name on its aircraft retained the Afrikaans name &quot;Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens&quot;. As a symbol of the new rainbow nation following the release of Nelson Mandela, one of SAA&#x27;s 747-300s, named &quot;Ndizani&quot; (registration ZS-SAJ), was painted in bright colours. This special-liveried 747-300 transported South African athletes to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The airline started online ticket sales and formed an alliance with SA Airlink and SA Express.

In 1998, services to Copenhagen Airport were stopped. A new airline president and CEO, Coleman Andrews, was appointed. The arrival of the American saw a comprehensive and controversial overhaul of the airline, changing the management of SAA. Mr Andrews was hired by Transnet, the state-owned parent company, to remedy the problem of dwindling passengers, which Transnet&#x27;s market research had revealed was caused by &quot;failure to fly on time, unfriendly and minimally-trained staff, poor food and SAA fares being 12–25% above its competitors&quot;. He was credited with rescuing World Airways from the brink of bankruptcy earlier in the decade. During his first 18 months as CEO, South African Airways&#x27; market value increased fivefold.

In June 1999, Transnet entered into a sale agreement with Swissair in which Transnet sold 20% of its shareholding in SAA to Swissair for R1.4 billion and also included an option to sell and transfer a further 10% to Swissair, thereby increasing its stake to 30%. In 2002, the South African government repurchased the shares.

Swissair&#x27;s costly purchases of SAA&#x27;s and many other large international airlines&#x27; shares led directly to its own shocking bankruptcy filing, on 1 April 2002.

In 2000, SAA ordered 21 Boeing 737-800s, reportedly worth US$680 million. Five CFM 56-7B27-powered examples were requested outright from Boeing, the rest from other parties. The 737s were to be deployed on short-haul routes, replacing Airbus A300s and A320s.

The 737 order was followed by an Airbus order in 2002. Under CEO Andre Viljoen, South African Airways requested Airbus to overhaul its fleet at a cost of US$3.5 billion in March 2002, taking advantage of a slump in the order books of both Boeing and Airbus. The airline industry was still staggering after the September 11 attacks in the US, which led to new aircraft orders either being deferred, or cancelled altogether. SAA was in a buyers&#x27; market and the demise of Swissair, which had A340-600s about to be delivered, effected Airbus clinching the SAA deal. This was part of a bigger order that covered 11 A319s, 15 A320s, nine A340-600s and six A340-300s. Three of the A340-600 aircraft came from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). The new Airbus A319s replaced the aging Boeing 737-200 fleet, but the Boeing 737-800s continued in service because SAA cancelled its A320 order before any aircraft were delivered.

Later that year, South African Airways made a successful bid for a 49% stake in Air Tanzania. The move highlighted SAA&#x27;s wish to gain a foothold in eastern Africa. The bid was worth $20 million, and was SAA&#x27;s first acquisition of a foreign airline. The merger failed in 2006, when new SAA management felt that the arrangement was fruitless.

On 1 February 2000, South African Airways and Delta Air Lines started to codeshare on SAA-operated nonstop Boeing 747-400 flights from Atlanta to Johannesburg, with return flights operated via Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Florida due to range limitations caused by the 5,557-foot altitude at Johannesburg OR Tambo International Airport.

In 2001, South African Airways won the &quot;Best Cargo Airline to Africa&quot; award from Air Cargo News – (even though South African is mainly a passenger airline) – and South African Airways signed a codesharing agreement with Nigeria Airways to provide service from the United States to Lagos using South African Airways 747s (this codeshare agreement is no longer in effect, and SAA&#x27;s flights to/from the United States no longer stop in Nigeria). The airline earned a spot on the Zagat Survey&#x27;s top-ten international airlines list, opened a new website and named Andre Viljoen as chief executive officer (CEO).

In March 2004, South African Airways announced its application to join Star Alliance. The airline alliance accepted its application in June, with SAA joining as a full member in April 2006.

In July 2004, Andre Viljoen resigned as CEO of SAA. In August 2004, Khaya Ngqula was appointed as CEO of SAA. A new chairman, Professor Jakes Gerwel, was appointed in the same month.

In 2005, SAA became the first non-Saudi airline to fly a direct Hadj service to Medina in Saudi Arabia.

In July 2005, SAA started a four times weekly Johannesburg-Accra-Washington, D.C. service with a Boeing 747-400. Service was increased to daily flights in July 2006, and the 747-400 was replaced by an Airbus A340-600. Because SAA could not obtain rights to fly passengers between Ghana and the US, Dakar replaced Accra as the intermediate stop. In 2010, SAA retired the last of its 747-400 fleet.

On 6 June 2006, the codeshare agreement between South African Airways and Delta Air Lines was terminated because of the airlines&#x27; memberships in rival alliances (Star Alliance and SkyTeam respectively).

===Restructuring and Star Alliance: 2006–2011===
The South African government&#x27;s plans called for the separation of South African Airways and its parent company Transnet. The deadline was moved from 2005 to 31 March 2006.

SAA joined Star Alliance on 10 April 2006, becoming the first African airline to join Star Alliance. To celebrate the occasion, and as a condition of entry, one Airbus A340-600 (registration ZS-SNC) and one Boeing 737-800 (registration ZS-SJV) were repainted in Star Alliance livery. South African Airways fulfilled 53 requirements during the accession process.

In May 2007, SAA launched an 18-month comprehensive restructuring programme which aimed to make the airline profitable. According to then-CEO Khaya Ngqula, this came largely after &quot;uncompetitive ownership and aircraft lease costs, excessive head count and fuel price volatility&quot;. The programme involved: the spin-off of businesses into seven subsidiaries, thereby allowing SAA to concentrate on its core business of passenger and cargo transport; grounding SAA&#x27;s Boeing 747-400 fleet; rationalising international routes (Paris was dropped altogether); the axing of 30% of the airline&#x27;s managers; among other reductions. This was expected to save the airline R2.7 billion (US$378.2 million). By June 2009, R2.5 billion had been saved.

Two retired 747-400s were reactivated in 2008 for flights to Lagos, and by 2010 Luanda as well.

On 20 June 2008, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) agreed to extend South African Airways&#x27; sponsorship of the organisation another 3 and a half years. This extension succeeded two years of co-operation that &quot;have seen a successful partnership blossom between SAA and the ATP&quot;. The deal was worth $20 million, and ran until the end of 2012. On the same day it was announced that a new ATP World Tour tournament would be held in South Africa in 2009. In 2010, the company sought to recover $4 million from then-CEO Khaya Ngqula, for allegedly spending the money on his friends and awarding business deals with organisations and individuals in which he had an interest. Among them are ATP and professional golfer Ángel Cabrera.

In February 2010, the airline appointed Siza Mzimela as its first female CEO. She replaced Khaya Ngqula, who was accused of mismanagement and therefore quit. Mzimela was previously CEO of SAA&#x27;s domestic partner airline, South African Express (SA Express). On 1 April 2010 she took over the position from Chris Smyth, the acting CEO since Khaya Ngqula left in March 2009.

At the end of 2010, SAA permanently retired the two Boeing 747-400s which were temporarily re-introduced in late 2008. This was expected to save it $60 million during the fiscal year ending March 2009. SAA leased two second hand Airbus A340-300s from Airbus Financial Services (AFS) to replace the 747s.

=== Financial difficulties and bankruptcy: 2012–2020 ===
On 24 February 2012 SAA&#x27;s new Airbus A320-200, registration ZS-SZZ, made its first revenue flight between Johannesburg and Durban. There were twelve A320s in the fleet as of December 2016. On 16 August 2012, SAA ended its Cape Town-London route after 20 years, due to declining passenger numbers and increasing airport taxes.

SAA began flights to Beijing, China on 31 January 2012. Buenos Aires flights ended in 2013 and, in January 2015, SAA announced plans to end its non-stop services to Beijing and Mumbai. Services to China were replaced by Star Alliance partner Air China with a flight to Beijing. In June 2015, the acting CEO stated that London, New York City, Hong Kong, Munich, Frankfurt and Perth were the only profitable long-haul routes; all others were loss-making.

In September 2017, SAA began reducing its fleet and expected to cut 23% of its flights. Standard Chartered Bank was the first bank in June 2017 to call in its SAA loan. The South African government provided R2.2 billion to settle the debt. Citibank was the second bank to refuse extending the loan facility. Together with some others, another R7.7 billion became payable at the end of September 2017. The South African treasury asked the Public Investment Corporation, which controls government pension funds, for R100 billion to help bail out state-owned enterprises, including SAA.

On 5 December 2019, the government of South Africa announced that SAA would enter into bankruptcy protection, as the airline had not turned a profit since 2011 and had run out of money. In January 2020, South African Airways announced that it would suspend several routes, e.g. to Munich in order to reduce its financial struggle. In February 2020, the airline introduced its first of four newly leased Airbus A350-900s in an attempt to modernize its loss-making long-haul fleet.

On 5 December 2019, SAA was placed under business rescue. Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana were appointed as the Business Rescue Practitioners of SAA in December 2019. A business recovery plan was expected by the end of February 2020, extended, then postponed. A final plan is yet to be presented.

In February 2020, ex-Secretary General of the ANC, Ace Magashule, stated that should the Business Rescue Practitioners take decisions not to the ANC&#x27;s liking, it would intervene. Economist Jacques Jonker, then at the Free Market Foundation, criticised Magashule, pointing out that the Business Rescue Practitioners are officers of the court in terms of the Companies Act of 2008, and that it would be illegal for the ANC to intervene in the business rescue process. When Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan later tried to justify the notion that the business rescue practitioners are accountable to him and not to the courts, Jonker pointed out that such a state of affairs would be unconstitutional.

In April 2020, following a request for further emergency financing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the South African government announced that it would stop funding the airline with immediate effect. The airline then announced plans to lay off all remaining staff by the end of the month, sparking fears that SAA was on the brink of liquidation.

As of 1 May 2020, all SAA staff members were on unpaid leave of absence, including those who are reporting for duty, with no pay for the 4,708 remaining workforce. Unaudited financial statements presented in a draft report show SAA made losses of almost R16 billion in the previous three years. SAA received R50 billion of government assistance between 2004 and 2020.

On 2 May 2020, the government of South Africa announced that South African Airways would be ceasing operations after 86 years of service, and that a new flagship carrier would be created for South Africa out of the ashes of the former airline. The liquidation process was set to begin on 8 May; however, a legal battle between the liquidators and the workforce delayed the proceedings indefinitely. In July, the creditors voted to accept the restructuring plan, allowing the airline to avoid liquidation. A full domestic network was to be reinstated by December 2020.

On 21 August 2020, The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) appointed Rand Merchant Bank to help with negotiations with private entities interested in buying into the country&#x27;s insolvent national carrier, which needed at least R10 billion to resume operations. On 30 September the airline announced that it was suspending all operations until critical funding could be agreed.

In September 2020, SAA suspended all flight operations as the Business Rescue Practitioners placed the airline under &quot;care and maintenance&quot; until further funding could be sourced.

In October 2020, the South African government said it was looking for partners in its efforts to bail out the airline. On 28 October 2020, the South African government bailed SAA out with R10.5 billion in order to implement the turnaround strategy. During 2020, the airline returned 4 Airbus A319s, all of its 10 A320s, all of its 6 A330-200s, 4 A330-300s, 3 A340-300s, 3 A340-600s, and all 4 new A350-900s to their respective lessors. Both Boeing 737 Freighters also left the fleet in early 2020, ending a long history of dedicated freighter operations at the airline.

As of February 2021, the South African government was in talks with three potential investors to revive the airline and resume operations, with a massively-reduced workforce. The South African treasury reported that the airline had incurred a total loss of R32 billion (US$2.1 billion) between 2008 and 2020. The Mail and Guardian estimated that the airline had received a total of R60 billion (US$4 billion) in government guarantees.

=== Relaunch: 2021–present ===
In June 2021, the South African government relinquished its controlling stake in the airline. After extensive talks with potential investors, they selected the Takatso Consortium. The consortium was to own 51% of the airline, while the government maintains a 49% stake. The consortium involves Harith General Partners and Global Airways. Harith General Partners is chaired by South Africa&#x27;s former deputy finance minister, Jabulani Moleketi. In the address in which he announced the takeover, Pravin Gordhan, the Minister of Public Enterprises, revealed that SAA would receive a R3 billion boost in investment from the new partners.

In an interview on 26 November 2021, Gordhan reiterated that the South African government still expects to complete the transaction with the Takatso Consortium in early 2022, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2022, SAA expanded its fleet with the addition of 2 Airbus A320-200 and added new routes from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Windhoek, Namibia.

On 31 October 2023, SAA resumed services to São Paulo in Brazil, the first intercontinental route to be flown by the airline since the start of the pandemic. SAA also resumed flights to Perth, Australia in April 2024. Since relaunching, South African Airways has increased the frequency of their Perth bound flights to 4 weekly flights, increasing to 5 by late January 2025. 

==Corporate affairs==
===Head office===
South African Airways is headquartered in Airways Park on the grounds of O. R. Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, Gauteng. The building was developed by Stauch Vorster Architects. Completed in March 1997 for R70 million, the current head-office building links to three older buildings.

South African Airways moved its head office from Durban to Rand Airport in Germiston on 1 July 1935. Before the head office moved to its current location, the airline&#x27;s head office was in the Airways Towers in Johannesburg.

===Business trends===
The business trends shown below are for the South African Airways group (including SAA, Mango, SAA Technical and Air Chefs), based mainly on the published annual reports; there are gaps and some inconsistencies, largely because the reports vary year by year in the information given and because figures are frequently restated in subsequent years. No figures appear to have been made public since SAA went into bankruptcy protection in December 2019.

The available trends are (for years ending 31 March):

===Emblems===
South African Airways&#x27; &quot;Flying Springbok&quot; logo was the symbol of the carrier from its formation in 1934 to 1997. The logo was discontinued in 1997 in favour of a new aircraft livery, but the word &quot;Springbok&quot; remains the airline&#x27;s radio callsign.
===Anti-competitive practices===
On 5 June 2007, it was announced that SAA paid R55 million to the Competition Commission of South Africa because of anti-competitive behaviour such as price fixing. This fine was in addition to a R45 million fine paid by SAA on 31 May 2006 as a penalty for SAA&#x27;s attempts to prevent travel agents from dealing with rival air carriers.

&quot;Kulula has once again called on government to call it a day and keep its promise...that South African taxpayers will stop filling the begging bowl for ailing state-owned businesses&quot;. Many other companies like Flitestar, SunAir and Nationwide had failed because they could not compete with state-funded SAA. &quot;State re-nationalisation of the industry will continue to be destructive to free and fair competition&quot;. The company said it was &quot;bizarre&quot; that the proceeds of its income tax, fuel taxes, VAT, import duties and other government levies then were paid over to a state-owned competitor.

===Racism controversy===
SAA has been accused of racism for rejecting white cadet pilots on the grounds of race, who met the educational and physical criteria. By filling out several dummy applications, journalists from the newspaper &quot;Beeld&quot; established that the online form had been programmed to reject any white applicants. The South African trade union Solidarity instituted legal action against SAA, resulting in the policy being revoked.

&quot;SAA&#x27;s normal recruitment process allows for the employment of white male pilots as and when vacancies exist; particularly when no candidate is available from a previously-disadvantaged background. Like all other South African companies, the airline is also required to meet statutory transformation targets. This means that, in recruiting, the airline has to ensure that the demographics of its employees match closely those of the country as a whole. This is in line with the employment equity definition which includes white females.&quot;

=== Corruption controversy ===
During the administration of Jacob Zuma the SAA board was implicated in a number of corruption-related controversies. Most notable were allegations of corrupt or irregular activities by then SAA Non-Executive Director and Zuma appointee Dudu Myeni, which were widely blamed for placing SAA in serious financial difficulty.

=== 2019 Industrial strike action ===
South African Airways was hit by strike action by unions starting 15 November 2019 with an agreement in principle being reached on 22 November 2019. The strike action reportedly cost the airline R50 million per day.

=== Chief executive officers (CEO) through the years ===
===Delinquent director judgement - Dudu Myeni===
In March 2017, Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and the South African Airways Pilots&#x27; Association (SAAPA) brought an application in the Pretoria High Court for an order to declare Dudu Myeni a delinquent director in terms of section 162(5) of the South African Companies Act 71 of 2008. The application was based on Myeni&#x27;s conduct whilst chair of the SAA board. During those five years (2012–2013 to 2016–2017), SAA ran up losses of R16.844bn‚ although it had previously been profitable. Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and the South African Airways Pilots&#x27; Association (SAAPA) called six witnesses against Myeni, including four former SAA executives. Myeni was the only witness in her own defence. In closing argument, the counsel for the plaintiffs, Advocate Carol Steinberg, said during her time at SAA, Ms Myeni blocked, delayed and obstructed important initiatives to turn the airline around. She broke the law and flouted basic governance principles. The evidence in court showed a pattern of repeated misconduct: dishonesty, obstruction and interference, improperly inserting middlemen, and governance failures. Accused of bringing the embattled SAA to its knees, and based on her actions during her five-year tenure as chairperson of the SAA board, Myeni was declared a delinquent director and banned from holding any directorship position for life by Judge Ronel Tolmay at the Pretoria High Court on 27 May 2020. The judgement and evidence now goes to the National Prosecuting Authority so a criminal case can be pursued.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 16 June 1937, a Junkers Ju 52/3m (registration ZS-AKY) was destroyed by fire after it crashed on take-off at Port Elizabeth Airport following engine failure in two engines. All on board escaped. This was the airline&#x27;s first accident in which passengers were injured.
* On 16 October 1937, a Junkers W34 fi (registration ZS-AEC), named &quot;Sir George Grey&quot;, crashed during a mail flight. The aeroplane was damaged beyond repair.
* On 28 March 1941, a Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar (registration ZS-AST) crashed at Elands Bay, South Africa. All on board were killed on impact and in the post-crash fire.
* On 5 January 1948, a Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar (registration ZS-ASW) touched down at Palmietfontein too far along the runway for it to stop before running off the end. The undercarriage was ripped off and the hull damaged beyond repair. There were light injuries to passengers but no fatalities.
* On 15 October 1951, a Douglas DC-3 (registration ZS-AVJ), named &quot;Pardeberg&quot;, flying in instrument meteorological conditions &quot;en route&quot; on a domestic flight from Port Elizabeth to Durban, flew into Mount Ingeli near Kokstad, Western KwaZulu-Natal. Seventeen people were killed. The board of inquiry determined that the unserviceability of ground-based radio navigational aids along the route was a major contributing factor.
* On 15 September 1952, a Douglas DC-3 (registration ZS-AVI) was damaged beyond repair while attempting to land at an unlit country airport at Carolina, South Africa after the crew became lost on a flight to Johannesburg from Livingstone, Zambia. After attempting to hold for thunderstorms to clear near their destination, the crew initiated a landing when their fuel ran low. The elevation of the airfield was mis-judged and the aircraft hit a rocky outcrop on final approach to the runway. No passengers or crew were killed or injured.
* On 8 April 1954, a de Havilland Comet I (registration G-ALYY), Flight 201, departed Rome for Cairo and Johannesburg. The aircraft crashed off the coast of Italy following a in-flight breakup, killing all 21 people on board. The wreckage was never recovered, but all known evidence pointed to a repeat of the recent accident to BOAC Flight 781. The aircraft was leased on charter from BOAC with an SAA crew.
* On 29 October 1960, a Boeing 707-344A (registration ZS-CKC), operating as Flight 218, executed a wheels-up landing at Nairobi Airport after damaging the undercarriage during an impact with the ground on its initial approach. No passengers or crew were killed or injured but the aircraft remained out of operation for many months until it was repaired and re-introduced into service.
* On 6 March 1962, a Douglas DC-3 (registration ZS-DJC) operating as Flight 512 crashed into a mountainside in the vicinity of Seymour, Eastern Cape, South Africa, after the pilot insisted on conducting the flight under visual flight rules (VFR) while flying below low cloud above rising ground. The pilot and first officer were killed but the passengers and cabin staff survived.
* On 30 June 1962, a Douglas DC-4 (registration ZS-BMH) was involved in a mid-air collision with a military Harvard training aircraft near Durban airport. The military aircraft crashed but the crew managed to land the airliner without injury to passengers or crew despite losing a large part of the vertical stabiliser. The aircraft was the last DC-4 manufactured and was repaired and returned to service. It is currently owned by the South African Airways Museum Society and still flies.
* On 13 March 1967, a Vickers Viscount 818 (registration ZS-CVA), christened &quot;Rietbok&quot;, operating as Flight 406, crashed into the sea near Kayser&#x27;s Beach during bad weather while on approach to East London, Eastern Cape. All twenty-five persons on board were killed. The accident investigation board stated &#x27;The available data is not sufficient for the originating cause of the accident to be determined with any degree of probability&#x27;. However the board could not rule out the possibility that the pilot suffered a heart attack resulting in a loss of control.
* On 20 April 1968, a six-week-old Boeing 707-344C (registration ZS-EUW), named &quot;Pretoria,&quot; operating Flight SA228, was lost near Windhoek, South West Africa (now Namibia). The crew used a flap-retraction sequence from the 707-B series which removed flaps in larger increments than desirable for that stage of the flight, leading to a loss of lift at above ground level. The subsequent descent went undetected by the crew, leading to impact with the ground. 123 people died.
* On 24 May 1972, the only successful hijacking of a SAA flight took place; a Boeing 727-100 (registration ZS-SBE) was en route from Salisbury, Rhodesia (now known as Harare, Zimbabwe) to Johannesburg. Two Lebanese, Kamil and Yagi, took control of the aircraft by packing dynamite sticks on the hat-racks. They were armed with a pistol. They forced the pilot, Captain Blake Flemington, to return to Salisbury, where they landed and re-fuelled with 12 hostages remaining on board. The captain tricked them into thinking that they were en route to the Seychelles, while he was in fact heading for Blantyre, Malawi. After landing, the passengers used nightfall to enter the cockpit, where they climbed down the emergency escape rope. By the time the hijackers realised this, only the captain, one passenger, and a flight steward, Dirk Nel, remained on the aircraft. The two hijackers started fighting with each other for possession of the dynamite fuse. In the ensuing chaos, the three captives escaped, leaving the two hijackers on board. Members of the Malawi security forces started shooting and the two surrendered. They were jailed for two years on a charge of being in possession of an undeclared firearm on board an aircraft. After serving one year of their sentence, they were released.
* On 28 November 1987, a Boeing 747-200B Combi (registration ZS-SAS and named &quot;Helderberg&quot;), operating as Flight 295, crashed in the Indian Ocean &quot;en route&quot; from Taipei, Taiwan to Johannesburg via Mauritius, after a fire in the main cargo hold. The cause of the fire is undetermined, and a number of conspiracy theories (mostly pertaining to the nuclear armaments being produced by the South African government at the time) are in circulation surrounding the crash. Ignition of an ammonium perchlorate cargo, a chemical used as a missile propellant, is theorized by forensic scientists to have caused the fire. At the time, passenger jets of SAA were suspected to have illegally carried weapons cargo for Armscor, in an attempt to circumvent UN sanctions placed on apartheid-era South Africa. All 159 people on board were killed.
* On 17 June 2006, on South African Airways Flight 322, a Boeing 737-800 en route from Cape Town to Johannesburg, a 21-year-old Zimbabwean took a flight attendant hostage in an attempt to enter the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit and divert the aircraft to Maputo, Mozambique. He was subdued while still in the cabin. The pilots had been monitoring the incident via CCTV and the aircraft returned to Cape Town where a police task force stormed the aircraft and arrested the suspect.
* On 6 November 2018, an Airbus A340-600 (ZS-SNF) operating Flight SA260 over Switzerland, encountered an overspeed warning due to the aircraft entering a wind convergence zone. The aircraft was en route at FL380 over Switzerland about 40 nm south-southeast of Zurich (Switzerland) when the aircraft reached a speed of Mach 0.89. The pilot in command deactivated the autopilot and initiated a climb to FL400 in order to reduce the aircraft speed. The acceleration caused an Angle of Attack warning, which the flight crew misinterpreted as being a malfunction. Subsequently, two of the three AIRDUs were deactivated. This also deactivated the auto throttle and deactivated some protection, causing the aircraft to enter a near stall state. The situation was recovered at FL340, with the pilots saying that they temporarily lost control of the aircraft. The investigation revealed that the checklists were not followed and the pilots were not properly trained on handling overspeed events. The pilots were not informed, that a bulletin addressing the Angle of Attack warning system was already implemented. They also found out, that one of the copilots did hold a CPL instead of the ATPL required by the airline. The flight continued to Frankfurt for a safe landing, where the crew were interviewed by the German authorities. Germany&#x27;s BFU, which led the investigation, reported the aircraft event as a serious incident.
*On 24 February 2021, an Airbus A340-600 operating as Flight SA4272 sent from Johannesburg to Brussels to fetch COVID-19 vaccines encountered an &quot;alpha floor event&quot; sent by the ACARS unit of the plane. This was activated when the Airbus A340-600&#x27;s envelope protection system activated to override the pilots to prevent the plane from stalling on take-off.
*On 12 November 2022, an SAA Airbus A320 (ZS-SZJ) being towed collided into a parked FlySafair Boeing 737-8BG (ZS-SJH) at O. R. Tambo International Airport. No passengers were on board either aircraft at the time. The FlySafair’s empennage section and SAA wing tip were damaged. As a result, both aircraft were rendered inoperable.

<text>Benacre National Nature Reserve is a national nature reserve in the English county of Suffolk. It is located on the North Sea coast in the parishes of Benacre, Covehithe, Reydon and South Cove. It lies between the towns of Lowestoft and Southwold and covers .

Benacre NNR consists of areas of open water lagoons and reed beds along the Suffolk coast including Benacre Broad, Covehithe Broad and Easton Broad and extending as far south as Reydon. The reserve features extensive reedbeds, woodland and heathland, as well as pits created by gravel extraction. There are over 100 species of breeding birds, including marsh harrier, bearded reedling, water rail, and occasionally bittern. The flora includes seakale, sea holly, and yellow-horned poppy. Reed is farmed commercially for the thatching industry, whilst enabling the bearded reedling to find a habitat.

The coastline has eroded rapidly over time and the reserve is threatened by both erosion and sea level rise. Some of the ongoing work at the reserve is stopping the encroaching sea by digging new lagoons and establishing more sea defences, and replacing the woodland lost to the sea.

<text>Benacre Broad is an isolated coastal lagoon on the North Sea coast of the English county of Suffolk. It is located in the parish of Benacre around north of the village of Covehithe. It is about east of Wrentham, north of Southwold and south of Lowestoft.

The broad is part of Benacre National Nature Reserve, a reserve managed by Natural England. It forms part of the area of the Pakefield to Easton Bavents Site of Special Scientific Interest and the Benacre and Easton Barents Lagoons Special Area of Conservation.

The main broad area has traditionally been made up of a number of smaller bodies of water and in 1996 a number of small pools were created to combat the impact of coastal erosion and increasing water salinity on habitats. At a 1997 survey, had an area of . At the end of November 2011 a high tidal surge broke through the narrow beach separating the Broad from the sea, inundating the area and increasing the salinity markedly. A survey in February 2012 found that the area of the broad had increased to and that the salinity of the water had increased to 22 parts per thousand. The water depth had also increased, although some separate pools within the lagoon area had remained as fresh water.

In 2020, the beach was again breached and currently (December 2020) a channel allows salt water to enter the broad at high tide, and the dresh water to drain from the broad as the tide drops.

<text>Thatching is the craft of building a roof with dry vegetation such as straw, water reed, sedge (&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot;), rushes, heather, or palm branches, layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof. Since the bulk of the vegetation stays dry and is densely packed—trapping air—thatching also functions as insulation. It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both tropical and temperate climates. Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries, usually with low-cost local vegetation. By contrast, in some developed countries it is the choice of some affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home, would like a more ecologically friendly roof, or who have purchased an originally thatched abode.
==History==
Thatching methods have traditionally been passed down from generation to generation and numerous descriptions of the materials and methods used in Europe over the past three centuries survive in archives and early publications.

In some equatorial countries, thatch is the prevalent local material for roofs, and often walls. There are diverse building techniques from the ancient Hawaiian &quot;hale&quot; shelter made from the local ti leaves (&quot;Cordyline fruticosa&quot;), lauhala (&quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot;) or pili grass (&quot;Heteropogon contortus&quot;).

Palm leaves are also often used. For example, in Na Bure, Fiji, thatchers combine fan palm leaf roofs with layered reed walls. Feathered palm leaf roofs are used in Dominica. Alang-alang (&quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot;) thatched roofs are used in Hawaii and Bali. In Southeast Asia, mangrove nipa palm leaves are used as thatched roof material known as attap dwelling. In Bali, Indonesia, the black fibres of the sugar palm, called &quot;ijuk&quot;, is also used as thatching material, usually in temple roofs and meru towers. Sugar cane leaf roofs are used in Kikuyu tribal homes in Kenya.

Wild vegetation such as water reed (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;), bulrush/cat tail (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.), broom (&quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot;), heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), and rushes (&quot;Juncus&quot; spp. and &quot;Schoenoplectus lacustris&quot;) was probably used to cover shelters and primitive dwellings in Europe in the late Palaeolithic period, but so far no direct archaeological evidence for this has been recovered. People probably began to use straw in the Neolithic period when they first grew cereals—but once again, no direct archaeological evidence of straw for thatching in Europe prior to the early medieval period survives.

Many indigenous people of the Americas, such as the former Maya civilization, Mesoamerica, the Inca empire, and the Triple Alliance (Aztec), lived in thatched buildings. It is common to spot thatched buildings in rural areas of the Yucatán Peninsula as well as many settlements in other parts of Latin America, which closely resemble the method of construction from distant ancestors. The first Americans encountered by Europeans lived in structures roofed with bark or skin set in panels that could be added or removed for ventilation, heating, and cooling. Evidence of the many complex buildings with fiber-based roofing material was not rediscovered until the early 2000s. French and British settlers built temporary thatched dwellings with local vegetation as soon as they arrived in New France and New England, but covered more permanent houses with wooden shingles.

In most of England, thatch remained the only roofing material available to the bulk of the population in the countryside, in many towns and villages, until the late 1800s. Commercial distribution of Welsh slate began in 1820, and the mobility provided by canals and then railways made other materials readily available. Still, the number of thatched properties actually increased in the UK during the mid-1800s as agriculture expanded, but then declined again at the end of the 19th century because of agricultural recession and rural depopulation. A 2013 report estimated that there were 60,000 properties in the UK with a thatched roof; they are usually made of long straw, combed wheat reed or water reed.
Gradually, thatch became a mark of poverty, and the number of thatched properties gradually declined, as did the number of professional thatchers. Thatch has become much more popular in the UK over the past 30 years, and is now a symbol of wealth rather than poverty. There are approximately 1,000 full-time thatchers at work in the UK, and thatching is becoming popular again because of the renewed interest in preserving historic buildings and using more sustainable building materials.

== Material ==

Thatch is popular in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, parts of France, Sicily, Belgium and Ireland. There are more than 60,000 thatched roofs in the United Kingdom and over 150,000 in the Netherlands. Good quality straw thatch can last for more than 50 years when applied by a skilled thatcher. Traditionally, a new layer of straw was simply applied over the weathered surface, and this &quot;spar coating&quot; tradition has created accumulations of thatch over 7’ (2.1 m) thick on very old buildings. The straw is bundled into &quot;yelms&quot; before it is taken up to the roof and then is attached using staples, known as &quot;spars&quot;, made from twisted hazel sticks. Over 250 roofs in Southern England have base coats of thatch that were applied over 500 years ago, providing direct evidence of the types of materials that were used for thatching in the medieval period. Almost all of these roofs are thatched with wheat, rye, or a &quot;maslin&quot; mixture of both. Medieval wheat grew to almost tall in very poor soils and produced durable straw for the roof and grain for baking bread.

Technological change in the farming industry significantly affected the popularity of thatching. The availability of good quality thatching straw declined in England after the introduction of the combine harvester in the late 1930s and 1940s, and the release of short-stemmed wheat varieties. Increasing use of nitrogen fertiliser in the 1960s–70s also weakened straw and reduced its longevity. Since the 1980s, however, there has been a big increase in straw quality as specialist growers have returned to growing older, tall-stemmed, &quot;heritage&quot; varieties of wheat such as Squareheads Master (1880), N59 (1959), Rampton Rivet (1937), Victor (1910) and April Bearded (early 1800s) in low input/organic conditions.

In the UK it is illegal under the Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964 (with many amendments) for an individual or organisation to give, trade or sell seed of an older variety of wheat (or any other agricultural crop) to a third party for growing purposes, subject to a significant fine. Because of this legislation, thatchers in the UK can no longer obtain top quality thatching straw grown from traditional, tall-stemmed varieties of wheat.

All evidence indicates that water reed was rarely used for thatching outside of East Anglia. It has traditionally been a &quot;one coat&quot; material applied in a similar way to how it is used in continental Europe. Weathered reed is usually stripped and replaced by a new layer. It takes 4–5 acres of well-managed reed bed to produce enough reed to thatch an average house, and large reed beds have been uncommon in most of England since the Anglo-Saxon period. Over 80% of the water reed used in the UK is now imported from Turkey, Eastern Europe, China and South Africa. Water reed might last for 50 years or more on a steep roof in a dry climate, modern imported water reed on an average roof in England, when thatched by a proficient craftsman, is more likely to last roughly 40 years. The lifespan of a thatched roof also depends on the skill of the thatcher, but other factors must be considered—such as climate, quality of materials, and the roof pitch.

In areas where palms are abundant, palm leaves are used to thatch walls and roofs. Many species of palm trees are called &quot;thatch palm&quot;, or have &quot;thatch&quot; as part of their common names. In the southeastern United States, Native and pioneer houses were often constructed of palmetto-leaf thatch. The chickees of the Seminole and Miccosukee are still thatched with palmetto leaves. Makuti thatching in East Africa uses Cocos nucifera.
==Maintenance in temperate climates==
Unlike conventional roof coverings, thatch has a maintenance cycle in the UK of 12–15 years. At this time, the ridge will need to be replaced and any other works to the main body of a roof can be undertaken. Rethatching takes place when the coat work has eroded to such an extent that fixings which hold the thatch material in place become visible on the surface of a roof. Each roof is subject to its own specific conditions and will weather according to many outside influences - the skill of the thatcher being an important aspect affecting longevity. 

Moss can be a problem if very thick, but is not usually detrimental, and many species of moss are actually protective. , remains the most widely used reference book on the techniques used for thatching. The thickness of a layer of thatch decreases over time as the surface gradually turns to compost and is blown off the roof by wind and rain. Thatched roofs generally need replacement when the horizontal wooden &#x27;sways&#x27; and hair-pin &#x27;spars&#x27;, also known as &#x27;gads&#x27; (twisted hazel staples) that fix each course become visible near the surface. It is not total depth of the thatch within a new layer applied to a new roof that determines its longevity, but rather how much thatch covers the fixings of each overlapping course. “A roof is as good as the amount of correctly laid thatch covering the fixings.”

== Flammability ==

Thatch is not as flammable as many people believe. Thatch is said to burn slowly, &quot;like a closed book,&quot; as has been stated by individuals familiar with the material. The vast majority of fires are linked to the use of wood burners and faulty chimneys with degraded or poorly installed or maintained flues. Sparks from paper or burned rubbish can ignite dry thatch on the surface around a chimney. Fires can also begin when sparks or flames work their way through a degraded chimney and ignite the surrounding semi-charred thatch. This can be avoided by ensuring that the chimney is in good condition, which may involve stripping thatch immediately surrounding the chimney to the full depth of the stack. This can easily be done without stripping thatch over the entire roof. Insurance premiums on thatched houses are higher than average in part because of the perception that thatched roofs are a fire hazard, but also because a thatch fire can cause extensive smoke damage and a thatched roof is more expensive to replace than a standard tiled or slate roof. Workmen should never use open flame near thatch, and nothing should be burnt that could fly up the chimney and ignite the surface of the thatch. Spark arrestors usually cause more harm than good, as they are easily blocked and reduce air flow. All thatched roofs should have smoke detectors in the roof space. Spray-on fire retardant or pressure impregnated fire retardants can reduce the spread of flame and radiated heat output.

On new buildings, a solid fire retardant barrier over the rafters can make the thatch sacrificial in case of fire. If fireboards are used, they require a ventilation gap between boarding and thatch so that the roof can breathe, as condensation can be a significant problem in thin, single layer thatch. Condensation is much less of a problem on thick straw roofs, which also provide much better insulation since they do not need to be ventilated.

==Performance==
The performance of thatch depends on roof shape and design, pitch of roof, position—its geography and topography—the quality of material and the expertise of the thatcher.

=== Advantages ===

Thatch has some natural properties that are advantageous to its performance. It is naturally weather-resistant, and when properly maintained does not absorb a lot of water. There should not be a significant increase to roof weight due to water retention. A roof pitch of at least 50 degrees allows precipitation to travel quickly down slope so that it runs off the roof before it can penetrate the structure.

Thatch is also a natural insulator, and air pockets within straw thatch insulate a building in both warm and cold weather. A thatched roof ensures that a building is cool in summer and warm in winter.

Thatch also has very good resistance to wind damage when applied correctly.

Thatching materials range from plains grasses to waterproof leaves found in equatorial regions. It is the most common roofing material in the world, because the materials are readily available.

Because thatch is lighter, less timber is required in the roof that supports it.

Thatch is a versatile material when it comes to covering irregular roof structures. This fact lends itself to the use of second-hand, recycled and natural materials that are not only more sustainable, but need not fit exact standard dimensions to perform well.

===Disadvantages===
Thatched houses are harder to insure because of the perceived fire risk. In the UK, 50–80 thatched roofs are destroyed in house fires yearly. Because thatching is labour-intensive, it is much more expensive to thatch a roof than to cover it with slate or tiles. Birds can damage a roof while they are foraging for grubs, and rodents are attracted by residual grain in straw.
New thatched roofs were forbidden in London in 1212 following a major fire, and existing roofs had to have their surfaces plastered to reduce the risk of fire. The modern Globe Theatre is one of the few thatched buildings in London, but the Globe&#x27;s modern, water reed thatch is purely for decorative purpose and actually lies over a fully waterproofed roof built with modern materials. The Globe Theatre, opened in 1997, was modelled on the original Globe, which was destroyed by a fire on a dry June night in 1613 when a burning wad of cloth ejected from a special effects cannon during a performance set light to the surface of the thatch. The nearby Rose Theatre was actually thatched with cereal straw, a sample of which was recovered by Museum of London archaeologists during the excavation of the site in the 1980s.

Whether thatch can cope with regular snowfall depends — as with all roofing materials — on the strength of the underlying roof structure and the pitch of the surface. A law passed in 1640 in Massachusetts outlawed the use of thatched roofs in the colony for this reason. Thatch is lighter than most other roofing materials, typically around , so the roof supporting it does not need to be so heavily constructed, but if snow accumulates on a lightly constructed thatched roof, it could collapse. A thatched roof is usually pitched between 45 and 55 degrees and under normal circumstances this is sufficient to shed snow and water. In areas of extreme snowfall, such as parts of Japan, the pitch is increased further.

== Archaeology ==
Some thatched roofs in the UK are extremely old and preserve evidence of traditional materials and methods that had long been lost. In northern Britain this evidence is often preserved beneath corrugated sheet materials and frequently comes to light during the development of smaller rural properties. Historic Scotland have funded several research projects into thatching techniques and these have revealed a wide range of materials including broom, heather, rushes, cereals, bracken, turf and clay and highlighted significant regional variation.

More recent examples include the Moirlanich Longhouse, Killin owned by the National Trust for Scotland (rye, bracken &amp; turf) and Sunnybrae Cottage, Pitlochry owned by Historic Scotland (rye, broom &amp; turf).

<doc id="103144" wikidata="Q691558" url="?curid=103144" title="Holt, Norfolk">
<text>Holt is a market town and civil parish in the county of Norfolk, England. The town is north of the city of Norwich, west of Cromer and east of King&#x27;s Lynn. The town has a population of 3,550, rising and including the ward to 3,810 at the 2011 census. Holt is within the area covered by North Norfolk District Council. Holt has a heritage railway station; it is the south-western terminus of the preserved North Norfolk Railway, known as the &quot;Poppy Line&quot;.

==History==

===Origins===
The most likely derivation of the name Holt is from an Anglo-Saxon word for woodland, and Holt is located on wooded high ground of the Cromer-Holt ridge at the crossing point of two ancient by-ways and as such was a natural point for a settlement to grow. The town has a mention in the great survey of 1086 known as the Domesday Book. In the survey it is described as a market town and a port with the nearby port of Cley next the Sea being described as Holt&#x27;s port. It also had five watermills and twelve plough teams and as such was seen as a busy thriving viable settlement. The first Lord of the Manor was Walter Giffard; it passed to Hugh, Earl of Chester, who then left it to the De Vaux family. By this time Holt had a well-established market and two annual fairs which were held on 25 April and 25 November. Over the years Holt grew as a local place of trade and commerce. The weekly market which had taken place since before the 1080s was stopped in the 1960s.

===Great fire===
On 1 May 1708, Holt was devastated by a fire which destroyed most of the medieval town in three hours. The fire started at Shirehall Plain and quickly spread through the timber houses of the town. The church was also badly damaged with its thatched chancel destroyed, the lead melted from the windows and the flames spreading up the steeple. Contemporary reports stated that the fire spread so swiftly that the butchers did not have time to rescue their meat from their stalls on the market. The damage to the town was estimated to be in the region of £11,000. The town subsequently received many donations from all over the country to aid reconstruction.

===Georgian Holt===
With most of the medieval buildings destroyed, the rebuilding made Holt notable for its abundance of Georgian buildings, that being the style of the day. However, the town repaired and retains its Norman parish church, which is dedicated to St Andrew.

===1968 RAF mid-air collision===
A mid-air collision over the town occurred on the night of 19 August 1968, involving a Victor Tanker from RAF Marham and a Canberra bomber from RAF Bruggen in West Germany. This followed an electrical storm that had disabled radar systems. All seven airmen on board were killed. A memorial stone hangs inside Saint Andrew&#x27;s Church.

==Churches==
The ancient Church of England parish church of Holt is dedicated to St Andrew the Apostle and probably has late Saxon origins. It was rebuilt in the early 14th century in the Decorated Gothic style by Sir William de Nerford and his wife Petronilla, daughter of John de Vaux, and a tower was added later in the same century. The church was thatched and was badly damaged in the great Holt fire of 1708. Between 1722 and 1727 it was rebuilt, with contributions from Lord Townshend, the Prince of Wales, and Robert Walpole. The church was restored between 1862 and 1874 by William Butterfield.

The Methodist Church, on Obelisk Plain, was built between 1862 and 1863 to a design by Thomas Jeckyll, on a site donated by William Cozens-Hardy of Letheringsett Hall, who also paid most of the building costs.

The most recent religious building is the Chapel of Gresham&#x27;s School, designed by Maxwell Ayrton and built in knapped flint and limestone between 1912 and 1916, with two angle turrets and an embattled parapet. This is now a Grade II listed building.

==Education==
===Gresham&#x27;s School===
Gresham&#x27;s School, a public school founded in 1555 by Sir John Gresham, originally for boys but co-educational since 1971, is located on the north side of the town.

===Other schools===
Holt Community Primary School is a state primary school for children aged 4–11. The infant school was built in 1910 and the Junior School by 1928. In 1965 they were amalgamated to form Holt County Primary School. The school has been extended and developed over the years. It changed its name in 1999 to Holt Community Primary School.

There is no state secondary school in the town, so many children travel to Sheringham High School between the ages of 11 and 16.

==Local points of interest==

===Holt Hall===
The hall, which stands in an estate made up of ancient woodlands, lawns, lakes and gardens, was built in the 1840s and extended in the 1860s. It was owned by John Rogers, whose son Henry Burcham-Rogers inherited it from his father in 1906 and was still the owner when he died in 1945. A Grade II listed building, it was subsequently owned by Norfolk County Council, who used it as an outdoor education centre. In 2023, it was sold to Gresham&#x27;s School, with funding from James Dyson, a former student, making the acquisition possible. In August 2024, despite objections from Historic England and The Victorian Society, the school was granted planning permission to demolish the north, services wing of the house and add a modern extension.

===Byfords===
1–3 Shirehall Plain – The building is thought to be the oldest house in Holt (the cellar dates back to the 15th century), a survivor of the great fire of Holt in 1708 and a further fire in the building in 1906. The premises traded as a hardware shop or ironmonger&#x27;s for over 100 years under the ownership of the Byford family. Byfords is now run as a café, delicatessen and B&amp;B.

===Blind Sam===
Blind Sam is the name given locally to the Queen Victoria Jubilee Lantern located in Obelisk Plain. From the year of Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 1887 until 1921 it stood in the Market Place, where it had two functions, to provide light to the Market Place and to provide drinking water from two fountains at the bottom. The light was powered by the town&#x27;s gas supply, which at the time was sporadic and unreliable, hence the nickname &quot;Blind Sam&quot;. It was moved to Obelisk Plain in 1921 to make way for the war memorial. Made by ironmongers in Glasgow, it was restored in the 1990s.

===Obelisk===
The pineapple-topped obelisk at Holt is one of a pair of gateposts from Melton Constable Park, the other having been given to the town of Dereham in 1757. Each gatepost had the distances to various places from Holt and Dereham respectively carved into the stone. At the start of the Second World War, to avoid assisting the enemy in the event of invasion, the townspeople of Dereham dumped their obelisk down a deep well, where it remains to this day. The people of Holt whitewashed their obelisk at the start of the Second World War and it remains in good condition.

===Chapel Yard===

Chapel Yard, the first major retail development in Holt in modern times, was developed in 1983 within the conservation zone by architect Eric Goodman and Richard Webster, with removal of 1950s warehouses and adaptation of derelict flint workers&#x27; cottages, a chapel, the old fire station, and the reservists&#x27; drill hall. During renovations, Goodman discovered that the cottages at 3, 4, 5 and 6 Chapel Yard dated to the mid-16th century; they are the oldest known buildings in the conservation area and have since been given Grade II listed status. The massive chimney breasts have pockets for drying grain. Corn was discovered in pots during renovation.

Goodman added two new buildings with doors and windows inset behind a covered walkway and with pan tile roofs supported by oak buttresses, derived from a traditional &#x27;Norfolk cart shed&#x27;. The model of a &#x27;yard&#x27; of shops, making use of both small workers&#x27; cottages and redundant land, was later adopted for Apple Yard by Ru Bruce-Lockhart, who consulted Goodman on the design of his scheme, and for Lee&#x27;s Yard, Feather Yard, Hoppers Yard and Franklyn&#x27;s Yard. Goodman was also consulted on the design of a new supermarket in Holt, built in 1986 and also based on a Norfolk cart shed. The supermarket, now Budgen&#x27;s, received the 1986 Graham Alan Award, an award from North Norfolk District Council which is given both for conservation and restoration and for well-designed new buildings, including those that make innovative use of traditional design forms and detailing.

Chapel Yard itself did not receive the Graham Alan Award, because Graham Alan&#x27;s son Mike Alan had consulted on the development. The judges instead sent a letter of recognition. The Norfolk Society awarded a certificate in March 1984. In addition, Historic England gave the buildings at 12 and 8 Albert Street Grade II listed status to protect the newly built environment; Goodman may be the only known design architect to receive such an accolade for a new development in North Norfolk. In 2022 the then MP for North Norfolk Duncan Baker recommended Goodman for an MBE. Chapel Yard is referenced as part of the 2021 Holt Conservation Appraisal and Management Plan.

==Former landmarks==

===Water tower===
The town&#x27;s water was pumped from the common land at Spout Hills to a brick water tower in Shirehall Plain. The tower was built in 1885 by Erpingham Rural Sanitary Authority and was high. It held 15,000 gallons of water; the water level could be read from the ground. The tower was in use until 1955 and was demolished in 1957.

===Windmill===
A brick-built windmill was erected in the late 18th century: when put up for sale in summer 1792 it was described as &quot;newly built&quot;. It was used by many different owners until the early 1920s. The sails were removed in 1922 and the rest of the machinery was removed in the 1930s. The brick tower was then used for storage until deemed unsafe, and was demolished in the 1970s. There are now homes on the site, known as Mill Court.

==Amenities==

===Holt Country Park===
Holt Country Park is a short walk from the town. Its history includes a horseracing course, heath, farmland, forestry and woodland garden. It is now woodland dominated with Scots pine and native broadleaves. Its rich ground flora supports wildlife including deer. The park has achieved a Green Flag Award every year since 2005.

===Holt Lowes===

The Lowes is an area of heathland of around to the south of Holt set aside by the Holt and Letheringsett Inclosure Act 1807 (47 Geo. 3 Sess. 2. c. &quot;19&quot; ). The poor of Holt had grazing rights for an animal and also had the right to take wood and gorse from the land for their own use. It is likely that the land was never used by the poor of Holt as the land was not wholly suitable. The Lowes was used for military training during the First World War. It is open to the public along with Holt Country Park. The Lowes has long been recognised as an important area for wildlife, with records going back to the 18th century. It was declared an SSSI in 1954 and for a while managed as a nature reserve by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust, which continues to act as managing agents for the trustees. As on all lowland heaths, there is a constant need for management to prevent the encroachment of trees. Recent work has concentrated on clearing a large part of the mixed valley mire, an area of sphagnum bog that supports plants like sundews and several species of dragonfly, including one, the keeled skimmer, found nowhere else in East Anglia.

===Spout Hills===
These consist of of green space, which provided the town of Holt with all of its water needs, enabling it to grow and flourish. An old reservoir still exists but the pumping station was dismantled in the 1950s.

===Bakers &amp; Larners===

Bakers &amp; Larners is a department store located on Market Place. It has been continuously owned by the Baker family since the eighteenth century.

==Transport==

===Railway===
The nearest railway station to Holt is in the town of Sheringham, where access to the National Rail network is provided by the Bittern Line to Norwich. Services are generally hourly and are operated by Greater Anglia.

====History====
Holt&#x27;s original railway station, which opened in 1887, was served by the Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway. Most of this network was closed by British Railways in 1959, but the short section from Melton Constable via Holt to Sheringham (services continuing on to Cromer and Norwich) escaped closure for a few more years. It succumbed finally in 1964 when the branch was cut back to Sheringham, which is now the nearest national railway station. The station was later demolished and the site is now under the town&#x27;s by-pass.

====Heritage====
In 1965, within a year of the closure of the line, the North Norfolk Railway was formed to restore part of the line as an independent heritage steam railway. Initially, it operated between Sheringham and Weybourne; later, it was extended to the eastern edge of Holt at a new station site. A horse-bus service, the &quot;Holt Flyer&quot;, once ran between the Railway Tavern in the town centre and the new railway station, timed to connect with trains; this has now been replaced by an AEC Routemaster bus.

====Future ambitions====
There are now plans by the Norfolk Orbital Railway to extend the railway back towards the town centre
and on to Melton Constable and Fakenham.

===Buses===
Several local bus routes operate in and around Holt, provided by Sanders Coaches.

===Roads===
The town is on the route of the A148 King&#x27;s Lynn to Cromer road.

===Air===
Norwich International Airport is sited in the northern outskirts of the city.

==Media==
===Television===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on BBC One, and by ITV Anglia and ITV Yorkshire on ITV1. Television signals are received from either the Tacolneston or Belmont TV transmitters. 
===Radio===
Local radio stations are BBC Radio Norfolk, Heart East, Amber Radio, Greatest Hits Radio East (formerly North Norfolk Radio) and Poppyland Community Radio, a community based station. 
===Newspapers===
The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;The Holt Chronicle&quot;, &quot;North Norfolk News&quot; and &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;.

==Festivals and cultural events==

=== Holt Festival ===
The Holt Festival started in Summer 2009 as an arts festival. The events run for a week and include music, theatre, literature, cinema and art.

===Doctor Who events===
On Sunday 25 June 2006, Holt was &quot;invaded&quot; by Daleks. The event was a celebration of BBC Television&#x27;s classic science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. &quot;The Doctor Who Midsummer Invasion&quot; attracted many fans of the ever-popular show to the town as well as some of its previous stars. Organised by Planet Skaro, a local sci-fi store that has subsequently closed, the highlight of the day was a Dalek parade through the town centre.

Due to the success of the first Invasion, another science fiction themed event took place in Holt on 30 June 2007.

==Sport and recreation==
Holt has a Rugby football club, formed in 1961. The club&#x27;s first match was played against West Norfolk on Gresham&#x27;s School playing field. In the early days the team used the White Lion Hotel (now closed) for their changing rooms and hospitality. In 1967 the club was able to purchase of land on the eastern side of Bridge Road in nearby High Kelling. The club began playing their home games at their new facilities in 1969. At Bridge Road the club has three full-size pitches, six dedicated mini pitches and a clubhouse which was built in 1970. There are changing room facilities for up to 100 players. The club has three senior sides, a junior side and mini rugby sides for 6- to 18-year-olds.

Holt United Football Club was formed in 1894 and was a founder member of the North Norfolk and Norwich League, which began in 1895. In 1927 the club joined the Norwich and District League and went on to win this league on five occasions. In 1935 the club was in the Norfolk and Suffolk League and did not suffer a league defeat until December that year, when they lost to Norwich City A at Carrow Road. Holt was the first amateur team to play at the newly built Carrow Road ground. In 1985 Holt United left their ground at Jubilee Road, which was sold to finance the new Sports Centre complex on Kelling Road. For one season Holt played their matches at Gresham&#x27;s School. In 1986 the club moved to their new ground at the Sports Centre. Four years later they dropped into junior football. During the past three seasons the club have remained in Division One of the Anglian Combination. At present Holt United runs three sides, the first team playing in the Anglian Combination and the Reserves and colts teams in the North East Norfolk League.

Holt Harlequins Hockey Club (formerly Cromer Hockey Club) plays at the astroturf ground at Gresham&#x27;s School.

Holt has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V.

<text>The subterranean or underground rivers of London are or were the direct or indirect tributaries of the upper estuary of the Thames (the Tideway) that were built over during the growth of the metropolis of London. They now flow through culverts, with some of them integral parts of London&#x27;s sewerage system and diverted accordingly.

==North of the Thames==
&quot;From west to east - sub-tributaries are shown indented&quot;
* River Brent (partially underground)
* Stamford Brook
*Parrs Ditch
* Counter&#x27;s Creek
* River Westbourne
** Tyburn Brook
* River Tyburn
* River Fleet, (following Farringdon Street, New Bridge Street and other roads).
** Lamb&#x27;s Conduit
** Fagswell Brook (Follows the course of Charterhouse Street)
* River Walbrook
* Lorteburn or Langbourne (now dry)
* Black Ditch
* Muswell Stream (sub-sub-tributary via Pymmes Brook and the River Lea)
* River Moselle (subtributary via the Lea)
* Hackney Brook (subtributary via the Lea)
* River Rom (partially underground)
== South of the Thames ==
&quot;From west to east - sub-tributaries are shown indented&quot;
* Sudbrook (partially underground)
* Beverley Brook (partially underground)
* Graveney (sub tributary of River Wandle)
**Norbury Brook
* Falconbrook
* River Effra
* River Neckinger
* Earl&#x27;s Sluice
** River Peck
* River Quaggy (partially underground) (sub tributary of River Ravensbourne)
* Heathwall Ditch

==Development==
In June 2008, the office of Mayor of London published outline plans to reinstate some underground rivers. In January 2009, a partnership among the Environment Agency, Natural England, The River Restoration Centre, and the Greater London Authority set out a strategy for putting this into effect by creating the London Rivers Action Plan.

<doc id="103152" wikidata="Q159606" url="?curid=103152" title="John Everett Millais">
<text>Sir John Everett Millais, 1st Baronet ( , ; 8 June 1829 – 13 August 1896) was an English painter and illustrator who was one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He was a child prodigy who, aged eleven, became the youngest student to enter the Royal Academy Schools. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded at his family home in London, at 83 Gower Street (now number 7). Millais became the most famous exponent of the style, his painting &quot;Christ in the House of His Parents&quot; (1849–50) generating considerable controversy, and he produced a picture that could serve as the embodiment of the historical and naturalist focus of the group, &quot;Ophelia&quot;, in 1851–52.

By the mid-1850s, Millais was moving away from the Pre-Raphaelite style to develop a new form of realism in his art. His later works were enormously successful, making Millais one of the wealthiest artists of his day, but some former admirers including William Morris saw this as a sell-out (Millais notoriously allowed one of his paintings to be used for a sentimental soap advertisement). While these and early 20th-century critics, reading art through the lens of Modernism, viewed much of his later production as wanting, this perspective has changed in recent decades, as his later works have come to be seen in the context of wider changes and advanced tendencies in the broader late nineteenth-century art world, and can now be seen as predictive of the art world of the present.

Millais&#x27;s personal life has also played a significant role in his reputation. His wife Effie was formerly married to the critic John Ruskin, who had supported Millais&#x27;s early work. The annulment of the Ruskin marriage and Effie&#x27;s subsequent marriage to Millais have sometimes been linked to his change of style, but she became a powerful promoter of his work and they worked in concert to secure commissions and expand their social and intellectual circles.

==Early life==

Millais was born in Southampton, England, in 1829, of a prominent Jersey-based family. His parents were John William Millais and Emily Mary Millais (née Evermy). Most of his early childhood was spent in Jersey, to which he retained a strong devotion throughout his life. The author Thackeray once asked him &quot;when England conquered Jersey&quot;. Millais replied &quot;Never! Jersey conquered England.&quot; The family moved to Dinan in Brittany for a few years in his childhood.

His mother&#x27;s &quot;forceful personality&quot; was the most powerful influence on his early life. She had a keen interest in art and music, and encouraged her son&#x27;s artistic bent, promoting the relocating of the family to London to help develop contacts at the Royal Academy of Art. He later said &quot;I owe everything to my mother.&quot;

In 1840, his artistic talent won him a place at the Royal Academy Schools at the still unprecedented age of eleven. While there, he met William Holman Hunt and Dante Gabriel Rossetti with whom he formed the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (known as the &quot;PRB&quot;) in September 1847 in his family home on Gower Street, off Bedford Square.

==Pre-Raphaelite works==
Millais&#x27;s &quot;Christ in the House of His Parents&quot; (1849–50) was highly controversial because of its realistic portrayal of a working class Holy Family labouring in a messy carpentry workshop. Later works were also controversial, though less so. Millais achieved popular success with &quot;A Huguenot&quot; (1851–52), which depicts a young couple about to be separated because of religious conflicts. He repeated this theme in many later works. All these early works were painted with great attention to detail, often concentrating on the beauty and complexity of the natural world. 

In paintings such as &quot;Ophelia&quot; (1851–52) Millais created dense and elaborate pictorial surfaces based on the integration of naturalistic elements. This approach has been described as a kind of &quot;pictorial eco-system&quot;. &quot;Mariana&quot; is a painting that Millais painted in 1850–51 based on the play&quot; Measure for Measure&quot; by William Shakespeare and the poem of the same name by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, from 1830. In the play, the young Mariana was to be married, but was rejected by her betrothed when her dowry was lost in a shipwreck.

This style was promoted by the critic John Ruskin, who had defended the Pre-Raphaelites against their critics. Millais&#x27;s friendship with Ruskin introduced him to Ruskin&#x27;s wife Effie. 

Soon after they met, she modelled for his painting &quot;The Order of Release&quot;. As Millais painted Effie, they fell in love. Despite having been married to Ruskin for several years, Effie was still a virgin. Her parents realised something was wrong and she filed for an annulment.
===Family===

In 1855, after her marriage to Ruskin was annulled, Effie and John Millais married. He and Effie eventually had eight children: Everett, born in 1856; George, born in 1857; Effie, born in 1858; Mary, born in 1860; Alice, born in 1862; Geoffroy, born in 1863; John in 1865; and Sophie in 1868. Their youngest son, John Guille Millais, became a naturalist, wildlife artist, and Millais&#x27;s posthumous biographer. Their daughter Alice (1862–1936), later Alice Stuart-Worsley after she married Charles Stuart-Worsley, was a close friend and muse of the composer Edward Elgar, and is thought to have been an inspiration for themes in his Violin Concerto.

Effie&#x27;s younger sister Sophie Gray sat for several pictures by Millais, prompting some speculation about the nature of their apparently fond relationship.

===Later works===

After his marriage, Millais began to paint in a broader style, which was condemned by Ruskin as &quot;a catastrophe&quot;. It has been argued that this change of style resulted from Millais&#x27;s need to increase his output to support his growing family. Unsympathetic critics such as William Morris accused him of &quot;selling out&quot; to achieve popularity and wealth. His admirers, in contrast, pointed to the artist&#x27;s connections with Whistler and Albert Moore, and influence on John Singer Sargent. Millais himself argued that as he grew more confident as an artist, he could paint with greater boldness. In his article &quot;Thoughts on our Art of Today&quot; (1888), he recommended Velázquez and Rembrandt as models for artists to follow. Paintings such as &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; and &quot;The Somnambulist&quot; clearly show an ongoing dialogue between the artist and Whistler, whose work Millais strongly supported. Other paintings of the late 1850s and 1860s can be interpreted as anticipating aspects of the Aesthetic Movement. Many deploy broad blocks of harmoniously arranged colour and are symbolic rather than narratival. From 1862, the Millais family lived at 7 Cromwell Place, Kensington, London.

Later works, from the 1870s onwards demonstrate Millais&#x27;s reverence for Old Masters such as Joshua Reynolds and Velázquez. Many of these paintings were on an historical theme. Notable among these are &quot;The Two Princes Edward and Richard in the Tower&quot; (1878) depicting the Princes in the Tower, &quot;The Northwest Passage&quot; (1874) and the &quot;Boyhood of Raleigh&quot; (1871). Such paintings indicate Millais&#x27;s interest in subjects connected to Britain&#x27;s history and expanding empire. Millais also achieved great popularity with his paintings of children, notably &quot;Bubbles&quot; (1886) – famous, or perhaps notorious, for being used in the advertising of &quot;Pears soap&quot; – and &quot;Cherry Ripe&quot;. His last project (1896) was to be a painting entitled &quot;The Last Trek&quot;. Based on his illustration for his son&#x27;s book, it depicted a hunter lying dead in the veldt, his body contemplated by two onlookers.

== Landscapes 1870–1892 ==

His many landscape paintings of this period usually depict difficult or dangerous terrain. The first of these, &quot;Chill October&quot; (1870, Collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber), was painted in Perth, near his wife&#x27;s family home. It was the first of the large-scale Scottish landscapes Millais painted periodically throughout his later career. Usually autumnal and often bleakly unpicturesque, they evoke a mood of melancholy and sense of transience that recalls his cycle-of-nature paintings of the later 1850s, especially &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; (Manchester Art Gallery) and &quot;The Vale of Rest&quot; (Tate Britain), though with little or no direct symbolism or human activity to point to their meaning.

In 1870 Millais returned to full landscape pictures, and over the next twenty years painted a number of scenes of Perthshire where he was annually found hunting and fishing from August until late into the autumn each year. Most of these landscapes are autumnal or early winter in season and show bleak, dank, water-fringed bog or moor, loch, and riverside. Millais never returned to &quot;blade by blade&quot; landscape painting, nor to the vibrant greens of his own outdoor work in the early fifties, although the assured handling of his broader, freer later style is equally accomplished in its close observation of scenery. Many were painted elsewhere in Perthshire, near Dunkeld and Birnam, where Millais rented grand houses each autumn to hunt and fish. &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, his first full landscape snow scene, painted in 1887, was a view looking towards Murthly Castle.

===Illustrations===
Millais was also very successful as a book illustrator, notably for the works of Anthony Trollope and the poems of Tennyson. His complex illustrations of the parables of Jesus were published in 1864. His father-in-law commissioned stained-glass windows based on them for Kinnoull Parish Church, Kinnoull. He also provided illustrations for magazines such as &quot;Good Words&quot;. As a young man, Millais frequently went on sketching expeditions to Keston and Hayes. While there he painted a sign for an inn where he used to stay, near to Hayes church (cited in &quot;Chums Annual&quot;, 1896, page 213).

==Academic career and baronetage==
Millais was elected as an associate member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1853; a decade later in 1863, he was elected as a full member of the Academy, in which he was a prominent and active participant. 

In July 1885, Queen Victoria created him a baronet, of Palace Gate, in the
parish of St Mary Abbot, Kensington, in the county of Middlesex, and of Saint Ouen, in
the Island of Jersey, making him the first artist to be honoured with a hereditary title.

==Last years and death==
After the death of Lord Leighton in 1896, Millais was elected President of the Royal Academy. He died later in the same year from throat cancer. He was buried in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Additionally, between 1881 and 1882, Millais was elected and acted as the president of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists.

==Legacy==
When Millais died in 1896, the Prince of Wales (later to become King Edward VII) chaired a memorial committee which commissioned a statue of the artist. The statue, by Thomas Brock, was installed at the front of the National Gallery of British Art (now Tate Britain) in the garden on the east side in 1905. On 23 November that year, the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; called it &quot;a breezy statue, representing the man in the characteristic attitude in which we all knew him&quot;. In 1953, Tate director Norman Reid attempted to have it replaced by Auguste Rodin&#x27;s &quot;John the Baptist&quot;, and in 1962 again proposed its removal, calling its presence &quot;positively harmful&quot;. His efforts were frustrated by the statue&#x27;s owner, the Ministry of Works. Ownership was transferred from the Ministry to English Heritage in 1996, and by them in turn to the Tate. In 2000, under Stephen Deuchar&#x27;s directorship, the statue was removed to the side of the building to welcome visitors to the refurbished Manton Road entrance. In 2007, the artist was the subject of a major retrospective at Tate Britain, London visited by 151,000 people. The exhibition then traveled to the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, followed by venues in Fukuoka and Tokyo, Japan, and seen by over 660,000 visitors in total.

Millais&#x27;s relationship with Ruskin and Effie has been the subject of several dramas, beginning with the silent film &quot;The Love of John Ruskin&quot; from 1912. There have also been stage and radio plays and an opera. The 2014 film &quot;Effie Gray&quot;, written by Emma Thompson, featured Tom Sturridge as Millais. The Pre-Raphaelites have been the subjects of two BBC period dramas. The first, entitled &quot;The Love School&quot;, was shown in 1975, starring Peter Egan as Millais. The second was &quot;Desperate Romantics&quot;, in which Millais is played by Samuel Barnett. It was first broadcast on BBC 2 Tuesday, 21 July 2009. Laurie Kynaston portrayed Millais in the Paramount+ adaptation of Elizabeth Macneal&#x27;s &quot;The Doll Factory&quot; (2023).

<text>The Migration Period ( 300 to 600 AD), also known as the Barbarian Invasions, was a period in European history marked by large-scale migrations that saw the fall of the Western Roman Empire and subsequent settlement of its former territories by various tribes, and the establishment of the post-Roman kingdoms. 

The term refers to the important role played by the migration, invasion, and settlement of various tribes, notably the Burgundians, Vandals, Goths, Alemanni, Alans, Huns, early Slavs, Pannonian Avars, Bulgars and Magyars within or into the territories of the Roman Empire and Europe as a whole. The period is traditionally taken to have begun in AD 375 (possibly as early as 300) and ended in 568. Various factors contributed to this phenomenon of migration and invasion, and their role and significance are still widely discussed.

Historians differ as to the dates for the beginning and ending of the Migration Period. The beginning of the period is widely regarded as the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia in about 375 and the ending with the conquest of Italy by the Lombards in 568, but a more loosely set period is from as early as 300 to as late as 800. For example, in the 4th century a very large group of Goths was settled as &quot;foederati&quot; within the Roman Balkans, and the Franks were settled south of the Rhine in Roman Gaul. In 406 a particularly large and unexpected crossing of the Rhine was made by a group of Vandals, Alans and Suebi. As central power broke down in the Western Roman Empire, the military became more important but was dominated by men of barbarian origin.

There are contradictory opinions as to whether the fall of the Western Roman Empire was a result of an increase in migrations, or if both the breakdown of central power and the increased importance of non-Romans created additional internal factors. Migrations, and the use of non-Romans in the military, were known in the periods before and after, and the Eastern Roman Empire adapted and continued to exist until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453. The fall of the Western Roman Empire, although it involved the establishment of competing barbarian kingdoms, was to some extent managed by the Eastern emperors. 

The migrants comprised war bands or tribes of 10,000 to 20,000 people. Immigration was common throughout the time of the Roman Empire, but over the course of 100 years, the migrants numbered not more than 750,000 in total, compared to an average 40 million population of the Roman Empire at that time. The first migrations of peoples were made by Germanic tribes such as the Goths (including the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths), the Vandals, the Anglo-Saxons, the Lombards, the Suebi, the Frisii, the Jutes, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, the Sciri and the Franks; they were later pushed westward by the Huns, the Avars, the Slavs and the Bulgars. Later invasions, such as the Vikings, the Normans, the Varangians, the Hungarians, the Arabs, the Turks, and the Mongols also had significant effects (especially in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Anatolia and Central and Eastern Europe).

== Chronology ==

=== Germanic tribes prior to migration ===
Germanic peoples moved out of southern Scandinavia and northern Germany to the adjacent lands between the Elbe and Oder after 1000 BC. The first wave moved westward and southward (pushing the resident Celts west to the Rhine around 200 BC), moving into southern Germany up to the Roman provinces of Gaul and Cisalpine Gaul by 100 BC, where they were stopped by Gaius Marius and later by Julius Caesar. It is this western group which was described by the Roman historian Tacitus (AD 56–117) and Julius Caesar (100–44 BC). A later wave of Germanic tribes migrated eastward and southward from Scandinavia, between 600 and 300 BC, to the opposite coast of the Baltic Sea, moving up the Vistula near the Carpathian Mountains. During Tacitus&#x27; era they included lesser-known tribes such as the Tencteri, Cherusci, Hermunduri and Chatti; however, a period of federation and intermarriage resulted in the familiar groups known as the Alemanni, Franks, Saxons, Frisians and Thuringians.

=== First wave ===


The first wave of invasions, between AD 300 and 500, is partly documented by Greek and Latin historians but is difficult to verify archaeologically. It puts Germanic peoples in control of most areas of what was then the Western Roman Empire.

The Tervingi crossed the Danube into Roman territory in 376, in a migration fleeing the invading Huns. Some time later in Marcianopolis, the escort to their leader Fritigern was killed while meeting with Roman commander Lupicinus. The Tervingi rebelled, and the Visigoths, a group derived either from the Tervingi or from a fusion of mainly Gothic groups, eventually invaded Italy and sacked Rome in 410 before settling in Gaul. Around 460, they founded the Visigothic Kingdom in Iberia. They were followed into Roman territory first by a confederation of Herulian, Rugian, and Scirian warriors under Odoacer, that deposed Romulus Augustulus in 476, and later by the Ostrogoths, led by Theodoric the Great, who settled in Italy. 

In Gaul, the Franks (a fusion of western Germanic tribes whose leaders had been aligned with Rome since the 3rd century) entered Roman lands gradually during the 5th century, and after consolidating power under Childeric and his son Clovis&#x27;s decisive victory over Syagrius in 486, established themselves as rulers of northern Roman Gaul. Fending off challenges from the Alemanni, Burgundians, and Visigoths, the Frankish kingdom became the nucleus of what would later become France and Germany. 

The initial Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain occurred during the 5th century, when Roman control of Britain had come to an end. The Burgundians settled in northwestern Italy, Switzerland and Eastern France in the 5th century.

=== Second wave ===


Between AD 500 and 700, Slavic tribes settled more areas of central Europe and pushed farther into southern and eastern Europe, gradually making the eastern half of Europe predominantly Slavic-speaking.
Additionally, Turkic tribes such as the Avars and - later - Ugric-speaking Magyars became involved in this second wave. In AD 567, the Avars and the Lombards destroyed much of the Gepid Kingdom. The Lombards, a Germanic people, settled in Italy with their Herulian, Suebian, Gepid, Thuringian, Bulgar, Sarmatian and Saxon allies in the 6th century. They were later followed by the Bavarians and the Franks, who conquered and ruled most of the Italian peninsula.

The Bulgars, originally a nomadic group probably from Central Asia, occupied the Pontic steppe north of Caucasus from the 2nd century. Later, pushed by the Khazars, the majority of them migrated west and dominated Byzantine territories along the lower Danube in the 7th century. From that time the demographic picture of the Balkans changed permanently, becoming predominantly Slavic-speaking, while pockets of native people survived in the mountains of the Balkans.

Croats settled in modern Croatia and Western Bosnia and Herzegovina while the Serbs settled in Southwestern Serbia, Eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern Montenegro. By the mid seventh century, Serb tribes were invading northern Albania. By the ninth century, the central Balkans and the area of southern and central Albania became invaded and settled by Bulgars.

During the early Byzantine–Arab Wars, Arab armies attempted to invade southeast Europe via Asia Minor during the late 7th and early 8th centuries but were defeated at the siege of Constantinople (717–718) by the joint forces of Byzantium and the Bulgars. During the Khazar–Arab Wars, the Khazars stopped the Arab expansion into Europe across the Caucasus (7th and 8th centuries). At the same time, the so-called Moors (consisting of Arabs and Berbers) invaded Europe via Gibraltar (conquering Hispania from the Visigothic Kingdom in 711), before being halted by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in Gaul. These campaigns led to broadly demarcated frontiers between Christendom and Islam for the next millennium. The following centuries saw the Muslims successful in conquering most of Sicily from the Christians by 902.

The Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin from around AD 895 and the subsequent Hungarian invasions of Europe and the Viking expansion from the late 8th century conventionally mark the last large migration movements of the period. Christian missionaries from the Roman West and Byzantium gradually converted the non-Islamic newcomers and integrated them into Christendom.

== Discussions ==
=== Barbarian identity ===
Analysis of barbarian identity and how it was created and expressed during the Barbarian Invasions has elicited discussion among scholars. Herwig Wolfram, a historian of the Goths, in discussing the equation of &quot;migratio gentium&quot; with &quot;&quot;, observes that introduced the equation in his 1778 history of the Germans. Wolfram observed that the significance of &quot;gens&quot; as a biological community was shifting, even during the early Middle Ages and that &quot;to complicate matters, we have no way of devising a terminology that is not derived from the concept of nationhood created during the French Revolution&quot;.

The &quot;primordialistic&quot; paradigm prevailed during the 19th century. Scholars, such as German linguist Johann Gottfried Herder, viewed tribes as coherent biological (racial) entities, using the term to refer to discrete ethnic groups. He also believed that the &quot;Volk&quot; were an organic whole, with a core identity and spirit evident in art, literature and language. These characteristics were seen as intrinsic, unaffected by external influences, even conquest. Language, in particular, was seen as the most important expression of ethnicity. They argued that groups sharing the same (or similar) language possessed a common identity and ancestry. This was the Romantic ideal that there once had been a single German, Celtic or Slavic people who originated from a common homeland and spoke a common tongue, helping to provide a conceptual framework for political movements of the 18th and 19th centuries such as Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism.

From the 1960s, a reinterpretation of archaeological and historical evidence prompted scholars, such as Goffart and Todd, to propose new models for explaining the construction of barbarian identity. They maintained that no sense of shared identity was perceived by the &quot;Germani&quot;; a similar theory having been proposed for Celtic and Slavic groups.

A theory states that the primordialist mode of thinking was encouraged by a &quot;prima facie&quot; interpretation of Graeco-Roman sources, which grouped together many tribes under such labels as &quot;Germanoi&quot;, &quot;Keltoi&quot; or &quot;Sclavenoi&quot;, thus encouraging their perception as distinct peoples. Modernists argue that the uniqueness perceived by specific groups was based on common political and economic interests rather than biological or racial distinctions. Indeed, on this basis, some schools of thought in recent scholarship urge that the concept of &quot;Germanic&quot; peoples be jettisoned altogether.

The role of language in constructing and maintaining group identity can be ephemeral since large-scale language shifts occur commonly in history. Modernists propose the idea of &quot;imagined communities&quot;; the barbarian polities in late antiquity were social constructs rather than unchanging lines of blood kinship. The process of forming tribal units was called &quot;ethnogenesis&quot;, a term coined by Soviet scholar Yulian Bromley. The Austrian school (led by Reinhard Wenskus) popularized this idea, which influenced medievalists such as Herwig Wolfram, Walter Pohl and Patrick J. Geary. It argues that the stimulus for forming tribal polities was perpetuated by a small nucleus of people, known as the &quot;&quot; (&quot;kernel of tradition&quot;), who were a military or aristocratic elite. This core group formed a standard for larger units, gathering adherents by employing amalgamative metaphors such as kinship and aboriginal commonality and claiming that they perpetuated an ancient, divinely-sanctioned lineage.

The common, track-filled map of the &quot;&quot; may illustrate such [a] course of events, but it misleads. Unfolded over long periods of time, the changes of position that took place were necessarily irregular ... (with) periods of emphatic discontinuity. For decades and possibly centuries, the tradition bearers idled, and the tradition itself hibernated. There was ample time for forgetfulness to do its work.

=== Viewpoints ===


Rather than &quot;invasion&quot;, German and Slavic scholars speak of &quot;migration&quot; (see , , and ), aspiring to the idea of a dynamic and &quot;wandering Indo-Germanic people&quot;.

In contrast, the standard terms in French and Italian historiography translate to &quot;barbarian invasions&quot;, or even &quot;barbaric invasions&quot; (, ).

Historians have postulated several explanations for the appearance of &quot;barbarians&quot; on the Roman frontier: climate change, weather and crops, population pressure, a &quot;primeval urge&quot; to push into the Mediterranean, the construction of the Great Wall of China causing a &quot;domino effect&quot; of tribes being forced westward, leading to the Huns falling upon the Goths who, in turn, pushed other Germanic tribes before them. In general, French and Italian scholars have tended to view this as a catastrophic event, the destruction of a civilization and the beginning of a &quot;Dark Age&quot; that set Europe back a millennium. In contrast, German and English historians have tended to see Roman–Barbarian interaction as the replacement of a &quot;tired, effete and decadent Mediterranean civilization&quot; with a &quot;more virile, martial, Nordic one&quot;.

The scholar Guy Halsall has seen the barbarian movement as the result of the fall of the Roman Empire, not its cause. Archaeological discoveries have confirmed that Germanic and Slavic tribes were settled agriculturalists who were probably merely &quot;drawn into the politics of an empire already falling apart for quite a few other causes&quot;. Goffart argues that the process of settlement was connected to &quot;hospitalitas&quot;, the Roman practice of quartering soldiers among the civilian population. The Romans, by granting land and the right to levy taxes to allied (Germanic) armies, hoped to reduce the financial burdens of the empire. The Crisis of the Third Century caused significant changes within the Roman Empire in both its western and its eastern portions. In particular, economic fragmentation removed many of the political, cultural and economic forces that had held the empire together.

The rural population in Roman provinces became distanced from the metropolis, and there was little to differentiate them from other peasants across the Roman frontier. In addition, Rome increasingly used foreign mercenaries to defend itself. That &quot;barbarisation&quot; parallelled changes within Barbaricum. To this end, noted linguist Dennis Howard Green wrote, &quot;the first centuries of our era witness not merely a progressive Romanisation of barbarian society, but also an undeniable barbarisation of the Roman world.&quot; 

For example, the Roman Empire played a vital role in building up barbarian groups along its frontier. Propped up with imperial support and gifts, the armies of allied barbarian chieftains served as buffers against other, hostile, barbarian groups. The disintegration of Roman economic power weakened groups that had come to depend on Roman gifts for the maintenance of their own power. The arrival of the Huns helped prompt many groups to invade the provinces for economic reasons.

The nature of the barbarian takeover of former Roman provinces varied from region to region. For example, in Aquitaine, the provincial administration was largely self-reliant. Halsall has argued that local rulers simply &quot;handed over&quot; military rule to the Ostrogoths, acquiring the identity of the newcomers. In Gaul, the collapse of imperial rule resulted in anarchy: the Franks and Alemanni were pulled into the ensuing &quot;power vacuum&quot;, resulting in conflict. In Hispania, local aristocrats maintained independent rule for some time, raising their own armies against the Vandals. Meanwhile, the Roman withdrawal from lowland England resulted in conflict between Saxons and the Brittonic chieftains (whose centres of power retreated westward as a result). The Eastern Roman Empire attempted to maintain control of the Balkan provinces despite a thinly-spread imperial army relying mainly on local militias and an extensive effort to refortify the Danubian &quot;limes&quot;. The ambitious fortification efforts collapsed, worsening the impoverished conditions of the local populace and resulting in colonization by Slavic warriors and their families.

Halsall and Noble have argued that such changes stemmed from the breakdown in Roman political control, which exposed the weakness of local Roman rule. Instead of large-scale migrations, there were military takeovers by small groups of warriors and their families, who usually numbered only in the tens of thousands. The process involved active, conscious decision-making by Roman provincial populations.

The collapse of centralized control severely weakened the sense of Roman identity in the provinces, which may explain why the provinces then underwent dramatic cultural changes even though few barbarians settled in them. Ultimately, the Germanic groups in the Western Roman Empire were accommodated without &quot;dispossessing or overturning indigenous society&quot;, and they maintained a structured and hierarchical (but attenuated) form of Roman administration.

Ironically, they lost their unique identity as a result of such an accommodation and were absorbed into Latinhood. In contrast, in the east, Slavic tribes maintained a more &quot;spartan and egalitarian&quot; existence bound to the land &quot;even in times when they took their part in plundering Roman provinces&quot;. Their organizational models were not Roman, and their leaders were not normally dependent on Roman gold for success. Thus they arguably had a greater effect on their region than the Goths, the Franks or the Saxons had on theirs.

=== Ethnicity ===
Based on the belief that particular types of artifacts, elements of personal adornment generally found in a funerary context, are thought to indicate the ethnicity of the person buried, the &quot;Culture-History&quot; school of archaeology assumed that archaeological cultures represent the &quot;&quot; (homeland) of tribal polities named in historical sources. As a consequence, the shifting extensions of material cultures were interpreted as the expansion of peoples.

Influenced by constructionism, process-driven archaeologists rejected the culture-historical doctrine and marginalized the discussion of ethnicity altogether and focused on the intragroup dynamics that generated such material remains. Moreover, they argued that adoption of new cultures could occur through trade or internal political developments rather than only military takeovers.

<text>Julius Sebastian Streicher (12 February 1885 – 16 October 1946) was a member of the Nazi Party, the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (regional leader) of Franconia and a member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, the national legislature. He was the founder and publisher of the virulently antisemitic newspaper &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;, which became a central element of the Nazi propaganda machine. The publishing firm was financially very successful and made Streicher a multi-millionaire. 

After the war, Streicher was convicted of crimes against humanity during the Nuremberg trials. Specifically, he was found to have continued his vitriolic antisemitic propaganda when he was well aware that Jews were being murdered. For this, he was executed by hanging. Streicher was the first member of the Nazi regime held accountable for inciting genocide by the Nuremberg Tribunal.

==Early life==
Streicher was born in Fleinhausen, in the Kingdom of Bavaria, one of nine children of the teacher Friedrich Streicher and his wife Anna (née Weiss). He worked as an elementary school teacher, as his father had. In 1913, Streicher married Kunigunde Roth, a baker&#x27;s daughter, in Nuremberg. They had two sons, Lothar (born 1915) and Elmar (born 1918).

Streicher joined the German Army in 1914. For his outstanding combat performance during the First World War, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, as well as earning a battlefield commission as an officer (lieutenant), despite having several reported instances of poor behaviour in his military record, and at a time when officers were primarily from aristocratic families. Following the end of World War I, Streicher was demobilised and returned to Nuremberg. Upon his return, Streicher took up another teaching position there but something unknown happened in 1919, which turned him into a &quot;radical anti-Semite&quot;.

==Early politics==
Streicher was heavily influenced by the endemic antisemitism found in pre-war Germany, especially that of Theodor Fritsch. In February 1919, Streicher became active in the antisemitic &quot;Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund&quot; (German Nationalist Protection and Defense Federation), one of the various radical-nationalist organizations that sprang up in the wake of the failed German Communist revolution of 1918. Such groups fostered the view that Jews and Bolsheviks were synonymous, and that they were traitors trying to subject Germany to Communist rule. In November 1919, Streicher joined the &quot;Deutschsozialistische Partei&quot; (German Socialist Party, DSP). This group&#x27;s platform was close to that of the Nazi Party, or &quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei&quot; (National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party or NSDAP). The DSP had been created in May 1919 as an initiative of Rudolf von Sebottendorf as a child of the Thule Society, and its program was based on the ideas of the mechanical engineer Alfred Brunner (1881–1936); in 1919, the party was officially inaugurated in Hanover. Its leading members included Hans Georg Müller, Max Sesselmann and Friedrich Wiesel, the first two editors of the &quot;Münchner Beobachter&quot;. Julius Streicher founded his local branch in 1919 in Nuremberg. 

By the end of 1919, the DSP had branches in Düsseldorf, Kiel, Frankfurt am Main, Dresden, Nuremberg and Munich. Streicher sought to move the German Socialists in a more virulently antisemitic direction—an effort which aroused enough opposition that he left the group and brought his now substantial following to yet another organisation in November 1921, the &quot;Deutsche Werkgemeinschaft&quot; (German Working Community, DWG); this group hoped to unite the various antisemitic &quot;völkisch&quot; movements. Meanwhile, Streicher&#x27;s rhetoric against the Jews continued to intensify to such a degree that the leadership of the DWG thought he was dangerous and criticized him for his obsessive &quot;hatred of the Jews and foreign races.&quot;

==Nazism==
On 19 September 1922, Streicher left the DWG after less than one year and formally joined the Nazi Party on 8 October (membership number 17). He brought with him enough members to almost double the size of the Nazi Party overnight. He later claimed that because his political work brought him into contact with German Jews, he &quot;must therefore have been fated to become later on, a writer and speaker on racial politics&quot;. He visited Munich in order to hear Adolf Hitler speak, an experience that he later said left him transformed. When asked about that moment, Streicher stated:

Nearly religiously converted by this speech, Streicher believed from this point forward that, &quot;it was his destiny to serve Hitler&quot;.

In May 1923 Streicher founded the sensationalist newspaper &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; (&quot;The Stormer&quot;, or, loosely, &quot;The Attacker&quot;). From the outset, the chief aim of the paper was to promulgate antisemitic propaganda; the first issue had an excerpt that stated, &quot;As long as the Jew is in the German household, we will be Jewish slaves. Therefore he must go.&quot; Historian Richard J. Evans describes the newspaper:
[&quot;Der Stürmer&quot;] rapidly established itself as the place where screaming headlines introduced the most rabid attacks on Jews, full of sexual innuendo, racist caricatures, made-up accusations of ritual murder, and titillating, semi-pornographic stories of Jewish men seducing innocent German girls.

In November 1923, Streicher participated in Hitler&#x27;s first effort to seize power, the failed Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. Streicher marched with Hitler in the front row of the would-be revolutionaries. As a result of his participation in the attempted Putsch, Streicher was suspended from teaching. His loyalty to the cause earned him Hitler&#x27;s lifelong trust and protection; in the years that followed, Streicher would be one of the dictator&#x27;s few true intimates. Streicher, Rudolf Hess, Emil Maurice, and Dietrich Eckart were the only Nazis mentioned in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;; in the book, Hitler praised him for subordinating the German Socialist Party to the Nazi Party, a move Hitler believed was essential to the success of the Nazis. When the Nazi Party was banned in the aftermath of the failed coup attempt, Streicher in early 1924 joined the Greater German People&#x27;s Community (&quot;Großdeutsche Volksgemeinschaft&quot;, GVG) a Nazi front organization established by Alfred Rosenberg. Streicher challenged Rosenberg&#x27;s weak leadership and on 9 July 1924 was elected as Chairman of the GVG in his place. When Hitler was released from his prison sentence at Landsberg am Lech on 20 December 1924 for his role in the Putsch, Streicher was one of the few remaining followers waiting for him at his Munich apartment. Hitler – who would value loyalty and faithfulness very highly throughout his life – remained loyal to Streicher even when he landed in trouble with the Nazi hierarchy. Although Hitler would allow suppression of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; at times when it was politically important for the Nazis to be seen as respectable, and although he would admit that Streicher was not a very good administrator, he never withdrew his personal loyalty.

In April 1924, Streicher was elected to the Bavarian &quot;Landtag&quot; (legislature), a position which gave him a margin of parliamentary immunity – a safety net that would help him resist efforts to silence his racist message. In January 1925 he also joined the Nuremberg City Council. Hitler re-founded the Nazi Party on 27 February 1925 in a speech at the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich. Streicher was present and pledged his loyalty; the GVG was soon formally disbanded. As a reward for Streicher&#x27;s loyalty and dedication, on 2 April he was appointed &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of &quot;Nordbayern&quot; the Bavarian region that included Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia. He established his capital in his home town of Nuremberg. His jurisdiction would undergo several changes in the coming years. On 1 October 1928, it was significantly reduced to the area around Nuremberg-Fürth. On 1 March 1929, it again expanded, absorbing a neighboring Gau. Now encompassing all of Middle Franconia, it was renamed &quot;Gau Mittelfranken&quot;. Finally, in April 1933, the districts were consolidated and became simply Gau Franken. In the early years of the party&#x27;s rise, &quot;Gauleiter&quot; were essentially party functionaries without real power; but in the final years of the Weimar Republic, as the Nazi Party grew, so did their power. &quot;Gauleiters&quot; such as Streicher wielded immense power and authority under the Nazi state.

==Rise of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;==
Beginning in 1924, Streicher used &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; as a mouthpiece not only for general antisemitic attacks, but for calculated smear campaigns against specific Jews, such as the Nuremberg city official Julius Fleischmann, who worked for Streicher&#x27;s nemesis, mayor Hermann Luppe. &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; accused Fleischmann of stealing socks from his quartermaster during combat in World War I. Fleischmann sued Streicher and disproved the allegations in court, where Streicher was fined 900 marks. &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;″s official slogan, &quot;Die Juden sind unser Unglück&quot; (the Jews are our misfortune), was deemed non-actionable under German statutes, since it was not a direct incitement to violence.

Streicher&#x27;s opponents complained to authorities that &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; violated a statute against religious offense with his constant promulgation of the &quot;blood libel&quot; – the medieval accusation that Jews killed Christian children to use their blood to make matzoh. Streicher argued that his accusations were based on race, not religion, and that his communications were political speech, and therefore protected by the German constitution.

Streicher orchestrated his early campaigns against Jews to make the most extreme possible claims, short of violating a law that might get the paper shut down. He insisted in the pages of his newspaper that the Jews had caused the worldwide Depression, and were responsible for the crippling unemployment and inflation which afflicted Germany during the 1920s. He claimed that Jews were white-slavers responsible for Germany&#x27;s prostitution rings. Real unsolved killings in Germany, especially of children or women, were often confidently explained in the pages of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; as cases of &quot;Jewish ritual murder&quot;.

One of Streicher&#x27;s constant themes was the sexual violation of ethnic German women by Jews, a subject which he used to publish semi-pornographic tracts and images detailing degrading sexual acts. The fascination with the pornographic aspects of the propaganda in &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; was an important feature for many antisemites. With the help of his cartoonist Phillip &quot;Fips&quot; Rupprecht, Streicher published image after image of Jewish stereotypes and sexually-charged encounters. His portrayal of Jews as subhuman and evil is considered to have played a critical role in the dehumanization and marginalization of the Jewish minority in the eyes of common Germans – creating the necessary conditions for the later perpetration of the Holocaust. To protect himself from accountability, Streicher relied on Hitler&#x27;s protection. Hitler declared that &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; was his favorite newspaper, and saw to it that each weekly issue was posted for public reading in special glassed-in display cases known as &quot;Stürmerkasten&quot;. The newspaper reached a peak circulation of 600,000 in 1935. One of the possible solutions to the Nazi&#x27;s perceived problem Streicher mentioned in the pages of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; was transporting Jews to Madagascar.

Streicher&#x27;s publishing firm also released three antisemitic books for children, including the 1938 &quot;Der Giftpilz&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Toadstool&quot; or &quot;The Poisonous Mushroom&quot;), one of the most widespread pieces of propaganda, which warned about the supposed dangers Jews posed by using the metaphor of an attractive yet deadly mushroom. Late in 1936 Streicher also issued &quot;Trust No Fox on his Green Heath and No Jew on his Oath&quot;, an infamously anti-Semitic children&#x27;s picture book by 18 year old Elvira Bauer. In the book the Jews are depicted as &quot;children of the devil&quot; and Streicher as the great educator and a hero of all German children.

Streicher did not limit his vituperative attacks to Jews themselves but also launched them against those he perceived as insufficiently hostile towards Jews. For example, he dismissed Mussolini as a Jewish lackey for not being anti-Semitic enough. Between 1935 and the end of the Second World War, upwards of 6,500 persons were identified and denounced in &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; for not being sufficiently anti-Semitic.

==Streicher in power==
In July 1932, Streicher was elected as a deputy of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 26, Franconia, a seat that he would hold throughout the Nazi regime. In April 1933, after Nazi control of the German state apparatus gave the &quot;Gauleiters&quot; enormous power, Streicher organised a one-day boycott of Jewish businesses which was used as a dress-rehearsal for other antisemitic commercial measures. As he consolidated his hold on power, he came to more or less rule the city of Nuremberg and his &quot;Gau Franken&quot;, and boasted that every Jew had been removed from Hersbruck. Among the nicknames provided by his enemies were &quot;King of Nuremberg&quot; and the &quot;Beast of Franconia.&quot; Because of his role as &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Franconia, he also gained the nickname of &quot;Frankenführer&quot;. Streicher became a member of the SA on 27 January 1934 with the rank of SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; and was promoted to SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; on 9 November 1937. On 6 September 1935, Hitler named him to the Academy for German Law. The &quot;New York Times&quot; decried this action with the headline: &quot;Reich Honors Streicher. Anti-Semitic Leader is Named to Academy for German Law.&quot;

Streicher later claimed that he was only &quot;indirectly responsible&quot; for passage of the anti-Jewish Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and that he felt slighted because he was not directly consulted. Perhaps epitomizing the &quot;profound anti-intellectualism&quot; of the Nazi Party, Streicher once opined that, &quot;If the brains of all university professors were put at one end of the scale, and the brains of the &quot;Führer&quot; at the other, which end do you think would tip?&quot;

Streicher was ordered to take part in the establishment of the Institute for the Study and Elimination of Jewish Influence on German Church Life, that was to be organized together with the German Christians, the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, the Reich Ministry of Education and the Reich Ministry of the Churches. A surgical operation prevented Streicher from participating fully in this endeavor. This antisemitic standpoint concerning the Bible can be traced back to the earliest time of the Nazi movement, for instance Dietrich Eckart&#x27;s (Hitler&#x27;s early mentor) book &quot;Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin: A Dialogue Between Adolf Hitler and Me&quot;, where it was claimed that &quot;Jewish forgeries&quot; had been added to the New Testament.

In August 1938, Streicher ordered that the Grand Synagogue of Nuremberg be destroyed as part of his contribution to &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. Streicher later claimed that his decision was based on his disapproval of its architectural design, which in his opinion &quot;disfigured the beautiful German townscape.&quot;

==Fall from power==
Author and journalist John Gunther described Streicher as &quot;the worst of the anti-Semites&quot;, and his excesses brought condemnation even from other Nazis. Streicher&#x27;s behaviour was viewed as so irresponsible that he was embarrassing the party leadership; chief among his enemies in Hitler&#x27;s hierarchy was &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring, who loathed him and later claimed that he forbade his own staff to read &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;.

Despite his special relationship with Hitler, after 1938 Streicher&#x27;s position began to unravel. He was accused of keeping Jewish property seized after &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in November 1938; he was charged with spreading untrue stories about Göring – such as alleging that he was impotent and that his daughter Edda was conceived by artificial insemination; and he was confronted with his excessive personal behaviour, including unconcealed adultery, several furious verbal attacks on other &quot;Gauleiters&quot; and striding through the streets of Nuremberg cracking a bullwhip. He was brought before the Supreme Party Court and judged to be &quot;unsuitable for leadership.&quot; On 16 February 1940, he was stripped of his party offices and withdrew from the public eye, although he was permitted to retain the title of a &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, and to continue publishing &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;. Hitler remained committed to Streicher, whom he considered a loyal friend, despite his unsavory reputation. Streicher&#x27;s wife, Kunigunde Streicher, died in 1943 after 30 years of marriage.

When Germany surrendered to the Allied armies in May 1945, Streicher said later, he decided not to commit suicide. Instead, he married his former secretary, Adele Tappe. Days later, on 23 May 1945, Streicher was captured in the town of Waidring, Austria, by a group of American officers led by Major Henry Plitt of the 101st Airborne Division.

==Trial and execution==
During his trial, Streicher claimed that he had been mistreated by Allied soldiers after his capture. When the German version of the Wechsler-Bellevue IQ test was administered by Gustave Gilbert, Streicher had an average IQ (106), the lowest among the defendants. Streicher was not a member of the military and did not take part in planning the Holocaust, or the invasion of other nations. Yet his actions during the war were significant enough, in the prosecutors&#x27; judgment, to include him in the trial of Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal – which sat in Nuremberg, where Streicher had once been an unchallenged authority. He complained throughout the process that all his judges were Jews.

Most of the evidence against Streicher came from his numerous speeches and articles over the years. In essence, prosecutors contended that Streicher&#x27;s articles and speeches were so incendiary that he was an accessory to murder, and therefore as culpable as those who actually ordered the mass extermination of Jews. They further argued that he kept up his antisemitic propaganda even after he was aware that Jews were being slaughtered.

Streicher was acquitted of crimes against peace, but found guilty of crimes against humanity, and sentenced to death on 1 October 1946. The judgment against him read, in part:

He, along with Hans Fritzsche, were the first persons to be indicted for what would later be classified as incitement to genocide, though Fritzsche was acquitted at trial.

During his trial, Streicher displayed for the last time the flair for courtroom theatrics that had made him famous in the 1920s. He answered questions from his own defense attorney with diatribes against Jews, the Allies, and the court itself, and was frequently silenced by the court officers. He cited the works of Theodore Kaufman, who called for the genocide of Germans by mass sterilization, as justification for his claims about the Jewry&#x27;s aggression against Germany. He also peppered his testimony with references to passages of Jewish texts that he also cited in the pages of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;.

Streicher was hanged at Nuremberg Prison in the early hours of 16 October 1946, along with the nine other condemned defendants from the first Nuremberg trial. Göring, Streicher&#x27;s nemesis, had committed suicide only hours earlier. Streicher&#x27;s was the most melodramatic of the hangings carried out that night. At the bottom of the scaffold he cried out &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot;. When he mounted the platform, he delivered his last sneering reference to Jewish scripture, snapping &quot;&quot;Purimfest&quot;!&quot; Streicher&#x27;s final declaration before the hood went over his head was, &quot;The Bolsheviks will hang you one day!&quot; Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, a journalist for the International News Service who covered the executions, said in his filed report that after the hood descended over Streicher&#x27;s head, he said &quot;Adele, meine liebe Frau!&quot; (&quot;Adele, my dear wife!&quot;).

The consensus among eyewitnesses was that Streicher did not receive a quick death from spinal severing. As with at least several others, the bungled hanging was caused by the willful sabotage of the hangman, Master Sergeant John C. Woods. 

Streicher&#x27;s body, along with those of the other nine executed men and the corpse of Hermann Göring, was cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the Isar River.

==In literature==
Streicher is portrayed in detail as a criminal psychopath in Philip Kerr&#x27;s detective novel &quot;The Pale Criminal&quot; (1990).

<doc id="103158" wikidata="Q7632208" url="?curid=103158" title="Subterranean London">
<text>Subterranean London refers to a number of subterranean structures that lie beneath London. The city has been occupied by humans for two millennia. Over time, the capital has acquired a vast number of these structures and spaces, often as a result of war and conflict.

==Water and waste==
The River Thames runs west–east through the centre of London. Many tributaries flow into it. Over time these changed from water sources to untreated sewers and disease sources. As the city developed from a cluster of villages, many of the Thames tributaries were buried or converted into canals.

The rivers failed to carry all the sewage of the growing metropolis. The resulting health crisis led to the creation of the London sewerage system (designed by Joseph Bazalgette) in the late nineteenth century. It was one of the world&#x27;s first modern sewer systems and is still in use today, having been designed to account for the city&#x27;s continued growth.

The Thames Water Ring Main is a notable large-scale water supply infrastructure, comprising 80 kilometres of wide-bore water-carrying tunnels.

The Thames Tideway Tunnel, due for completion in 2025, will be a deep tunnel long, running mostly under the tidal section of the River Thames through central London to capture, store and convey almost all the raw sewage and rainwater that currently overflows into the river.

==Transport==
The London Underground was the world&#x27;s first underground railway and one of its most extensive. Its construction began in 1860 with the Metropolitan Railway from Farringdon to Paddington. It opened in 1863, after much disruption from the use of &quot;cut-and-cover&quot; techniques that involved digging large trenches along the course of existing roads, and then constructing a roof over the excavation to reinstate the road surface.

Tube railways, which caused less disruption because they were constructed by boring a tunnel, arrived in 1890, with the opening of the City and South London Railway, a line from Stockwell to King William Street. It was planned as a cable-hauled railway, but the advent of electric traction resulted in a simpler solution, and the change was made before the cable system was built. It became the world&#x27;s first electric tube railway. Although the system includes of track, only about 45 percent is actually below ground.

Kingsway has an almost intact underground passageway for trams, which is occasionally open to the public.

Tunnels underneath the River Thames range from foot-tunnels to road tunnels and the tunnels of the Underground. The first of these, the Thames Tunnel, designed by Marc Brunel, was the first tunnel known to cross under a navigable river. It ran for from Rotherhithe to Wapping, and opened in 1843. It was used as a pedestrian subway, as the company did not have enough money or finance to build the intended access ramps for horse-drawn traffic. These tunnels were later used by the East London branch of the Metropolitan Railway from Shoreditch to New Cross. It was refurbished in 2011 and became part of the London Overground network.

Several railway stations have cavernous vaults and tunnels running beneath them, often disused, or reopened with a new purpose. Examples include The Old Vic Tunnels, beneath London Waterloo station, and the vaults beneath London Bridge station, formerly utilised by the theatre company Shunt.

==Defence==
Many underground military citadels were built under London. Few are acknowledged, and even fewer are open to the public. One exception is the famous Cabinet War Rooms, used by Winston Churchill during the Second World War.

During the war, parts of the Underground were converted into air-raid shelters known as deep-level shelters. Some were converted for military and civil defence use, such as the now-disused Kingsway telephone exchange.

Other civil defence centres in London are wholly or partly underground, mostly remnants from the Cold War. Many other subterranean facilities exist around the centre of government in Whitehall, often linked by tunnels.

In December 1980, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; revealed the existence of secret tunnels linking government buildings, which they claimed would be used in the event of a national emergency. It is believed these tunnels also link to Buckingham Palace. Author Duncan Campbell discussed these facilities in more detail, in the book &quot;War Plan UK: The Truth about Civil Defence in Britain&quot; (1982). Peter Laurie wrote a book about these facilities, titled &quot;Beneath the City Streets: A Private Inquiry into the Nuclear Preoccupations of Government&quot; (1970).

==Utilities==
London, like most other major cities, established an extensive underground infrastructure for electricity distribution, natural gas supply, water supply and telecommunications.

Starting in 1861, Victorian engineers built miles of purpose-built subways large enough to walk through, and through which they could run gas, electricity, water and hydraulic power pipes. These works removed the inconvenience of having to repeatedly excavate highways to allow access to underground utilities.

==Abandoned structures==
Some underground structures are no longer in use. These include:

* The London Hydraulic Power Company, set up in 1883, installed a hydraulic power network of high-pressure cast-iron water mains. These were bought by Mercury Communications for use as telecommunications ducts.
* Sections of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company tunnels linking the General Post Office and Euston Railway station.
* An extensive private underground railway, the London Post Office Railway, was constructed by the Post Office, fell into disuse and has now become a tourist attraction.
* Closed London Underground stations are generally not accessible to the public except on London Transport Museum guided tours.

<text>Der Stürmer (; literally, &quot;The Stormer / Stormtrooper / Attacker&quot;) was a weekly German tabloid-format newspaper published from 1923 to the end of World War II by Julius Streicher, the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Franconia, with brief suspensions in publication due to legal difficulties. It was a significant part of Nazi propaganda, and was virulently anti-Semitic. The paper was not an official publication of the Nazi Party, but was published privately by Streicher. For this reason, the paper did not display the Nazi Party swastika in its logo.

The paper was a very lucrative business for Streicher, and made him a multi-millionaire. The newspaper originated at Nuremberg during Adolf Hitler&#x27;s attempt to establish power and control. The first copy of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; was published on 20 April 1923. &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;s circulation grew over time, eventually distributing to a large percentage of the German population, as well as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The newspaper reached a peak circulation of 486,000 in 1937.

Unlike the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (&quot;The Völkisch Observer&quot;), the official Nazi Party paper, which gave itself an outwardly serious appearance, &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; often ran obscene material such as the blood libel and graphic caricatures of Jews, as well as sexually explicit, anti-communist, and anti-monarchist propaganda. As early as 1933, Streicher was calling for the extermination of the Jews in &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;. During the war, Streicher regularly authorized articles demanding the annihilation and extermination of the &quot;Jewish race&quot;. After the war, Streicher was convicted of being an accessory for crimes against humanity, and was executed by hanging.

==Circulation==
Most of the paper&#x27;s readers were young people, and people from the lowest strata of German society. Copies of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; were displayed in prominent red &quot;&quot; (display boxes) throughout the Reich. As well as advertising the publication, the cases also allowed its articles to reach those readers who either did not have time to buy and read a newspaper in depth, or could not afford the expense. In 1927, &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; sold about 27,000 copies every week. By 1935, its circulation had increased to around 480,000.

==Nazi attitudes towards the paper==
From the late 1920s, Julius Streicher&#x27;s vulgar style of propagandism increasingly became a cause of embarrassment for the Nazi Party. In 1936, the sale of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; was restricted in Berlin during the Summer Olympics, in an attempt to preserve the Nazi regime&#x27;s international reputation and prestige. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels tried to completely ban the newspaper in 1938, &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring forbade &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; in all of his departments, and Baldur von Schirach prohibited Hitler Youth members from reading it in Hitler Youth-sponsored hostels and other education facilities by a &quot;Reichsbefehl&quot; (&quot;Reich command&quot;). Göring harboured a particularly intense hatred of the paper, especially after it published a libelous article alleging that his daughter Edda had been conceived through artificial insemination. It was only through Hitler&#x27;s intervention that Streicher was spared from severe punishment.

However, other senior Nazi officials, including &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, chairman of the German Labour Front Robert Ley, and proprietor of the &quot;Zentral Verlag&quot; (Central Press) Max Amann, whose organization comprised 80% of the German press, endorsed the publication, and their statements were often published in the paper. Albert Forster, the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Danzig (now Gdańsk), wrote in 1937:

With pleasure, I say that the &quot;Stürmer&quot;, more than any other daily or weekly newspaper, has made clear to the people in simple ways the danger of Jewry. Without Julius Streicher and his &quot;Stürmer&quot;, the importance of a solution to the Jewish question would not be seen to be as critical as it actually is by many citizens. It is therefore to be hoped that those who want to learn the unvarnished truth about the Jewish question will read the &quot;Stürmer&quot;.

Hitler considered Streicher&#x27;s primitive methods to be effective in influencing &quot;the man in the street&quot;. Although Streicher and his paper were increasingly isolated in the Nazi party, Hitler continued to support Streicher, and was an avid reader of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;. In December 1941, he stated: &quot;Streicher is reproached for his &quot;Stürmer&quot;. The truth is the opposite of what people say: He idealized the Jew. The Jew is baser, fiercer, more diabolical than Streicher depicted him.&quot; In February 1942, he praised the newspaper, by stating: &quot;One must never forget the services rendered by the &quot;Stürmer&quot;. Now that the Jews are known for what they are, nobody any longer thinks that Streicher libeled them.&quot;

Hermann Rauschning, who claimed to be Hitler&#x27;s &quot;confidant&quot;, said in the mid-1930s:

Antisemitism was beyond question the most important weapon in Hitler&#x27;s propagandist arsenal, and almost everywhere, it was of deadly efficiency. That was why he had allowed Streicher, for example, a free hand. The man&#x27;s stuff, too, was amusing, and very cleverly done. Wherever, he wondered, did Streicher get his constant supply of new material? He, Hitler, was simply on thorns to see each new issue of the &quot;Stürmer&quot;. It was the one periodical that he always read with pleasure, from the first page to the last.

During the war, the paper&#x27;s circulation suffered because of paper shortages, as well as Streicher&#x27;s exile from Nuremberg for corruption. More ominously, because of the Holocaust, the people it targeted had begun to disappear from everyday life, which diminished the paper&#x27;s relevance. Hitler, however, insisted that Streicher receive sufficient support to continue publishing &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;. The final edition of the newspaper was published in February 1945. The chief editor, Julius Streicher, was tried at Nuremberg after the end of the war, and after being found guilty of being an accessory to crimes against humanity, he was hanged in 1946.

==Antisemitic content==
According to the American writer Dennis Showalter, &quot;a major challenge of political antisemitism involves overcoming the images of the &#x27;Jew next door&#x27; – the living, breathing acquaintance or associate whose simple existence appears to deny the validity of that negative stereotype&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s lurid content appealed to a large spectrum of readers who were lower class and less-sophisticated. &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; was known for its use of simple themes that required little thought. The newspaper often gave descriptions of how to identify Jewish people, and included racist political cartoons, including antisemitic caricatures. Besides the graphic depictions, articles often focused on imaginary fears, exaggerations, and perceived behavioral differences between Jews and other German citizens.

After the war, Streicher was tried at the Nuremberg trials. His publishing and speaking activities were a major part of the evidence presented against him. In essence, the prosecutors took the line that Streicher&#x27;s role in inciting Germans to murder Jews made him an accessory to murder, and thus as culpable as those who actually carried out the killing. Prosecutors also introduced decisive and irrefutable evidence that Streicher continued his incendiary articles and speeches when he was well aware that Jews were being killed. Streicher was found guilty of being an accessory for crimes against humanity, and was executed by hanging shortly afterwards.

=== Anti-Semitic caricatures ===
&quot;Der Stürmer&quot; was known for its virulently anti-Semitic caricatures, which depicted Jews as ugly characters with exaggerated facial features and misshapen bodies. In his propaganda work, Streicher furthered medieval stereotypes accusing Jews of killing children, sacrificing their bodies, and drinking their blood. The large majority of these drawings were the work of Philipp Rupprecht, known as &quot;Fips&quot;, who was one of the best-known anti-Semitic cartoonists of Nazi Germany. Through the adaptation and amalgamation of almost every existing anti-Semitic stereotype, myth, and tradition, Rupprecht&#x27;s virulent attacks aimed predominantly at the dehumanization and demonization of Jews. At the bottom of the title page, there was always the motto &quot;Die Juden sind unser Unglück!&quot; (&quot;The Jews are our misfortune!&quot;), coined by Heinrich von Treitschke in the 1880s. In the nameplate was the motto &quot;Deutsches Wochenblatt zum Kampfe um die Wahrheit&quot; (&quot;German Weekly Newspaper in the Fight for Truth&quot;).

===Alleged sexual crimes===
Stories of &quot;Rassenschande&quot;, which denoted alleged scandals of Jewish men and German women having sex, were staples of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;. Streicher described Jews as sex offenders who were &quot;violators of the innocent, perpetrators of bizarre sex crimes, and ritual murderers&quot;, who allegedly performed in religious ceremonies using blood of other humans, usually Christians. Streicher also frequently reported attempts of child molestation by Jews. &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; never lacked details about sexual intercourse, names, and crimes to keep readers aroused and entertained. These accusations, articles, and crimes printed in &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; were often inaccurate, and rarely investigated by staff members. In the newspaper&#x27;s opinion, if a German girl became pregnant by a Jew, the Jew would deny paternity, offer to pay for an abortion, fail to pay child support, or leave for the U.S. Within &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;, it was not uncommon to read reports of German women aborting their children because they did not want to bring a &quot;Jewish bastard into the world&quot;.

Streicher believed in the antisemitic telegony hypotheses of Artur Dinter. 

===Accusations of financial crimes===
Showalter said: &quot;For Julius Streicher, the Jews&#x27; hatred for Christianity was concealed only for one reason: Business.&quot; Jewish businessmen were often portrayed as doing almost anything to obtain financial wealth, which included, in his words, &quot;become a usurper, a traitor, a murderer&quot;. In the summer of 1931, Streicher focused much of the paper&#x27;s attention on a Jewish-owned butchery. As an example, when a philanthropic merchant started operating a soup kitchen, &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; ran articles accusing the business of poisoning the food being served. &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; criticized and cherrypicked every single price increase and decrease in Jewish shops, as well as their charitable donations, denouncing it as a further form of financial greed. This attack on Jewish benevolence, generosity, and philanthropism received the most public criticism out of all of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;&#x27;s anti-Semitic propaganda. Its &quot;Letter Box&quot; encouraged the reporting of Jewish illegal acts, while its unofficial style helped prevent suspicion of propaganda, and lent it an air of &quot;authenticity&quot;.

<doc id="103163" wikidata="Q983030" url="?curid=103163" title="Father Mathew">
<text>Theobald Mathew (10 October 1790 – 8 December 1856) was an Irish Catholic priest and teetotalist reformer, popularly known as Father Mathew. He was born at Thomastown, near Golden, County Tipperary, on 10 October 1790, to James Mathew and his wife Anne, daughter of George Whyte, of Cappaghwhyte. Of the family of the Earls Landaff (his father, James, was a first cousin of Thomas Mathew, father of the first earl), he was a kinsman of the clergyman Arnold Mathew.

He received his schooling in County Kilkenny, then moved for a short time to Maynooth. From 1808 to 1814 he studied in Dublin, where in the latter year he was ordained to the priesthood. Having entered the Capuchin order, after a brief period of service at Kilkenny, he joined the mission in Cork.

Statues of Mathew stand on St. Patrick&#x27;s Street, Cork, by J. H. Foley (1864), and on O&#x27;Connell Street, Dublin, by Mary Redmond (1893). There is a Fr. Mathew Bridge in Limerick City, named after the temperance reformer when it was rebuilt between 1844 and 1846. The Capuchin church in Cork, Holy Trinity, stands on Father Mathew Quay and was commissioned by him.

==Total Abstinence Society==

The movement with which his name is associated began on 10 April 1838 with the establishment of the &quot;Knights of Father Mathew&quot;, which in less than nine months enrolled no fewer than 150,000 names. Over time this became the Catholic Total Abstinence Society. It rapidly spread to Limerick and elsewhere, and some idea of its popularity may be formed from the fact that at Nenagh 20,000 persons are said to have taken the pledge in one day, 100,000 at Galway in two days, and 70,000 in Dublin in five days. At its height, just before the Great Famine of 1845–49, his movement enrolled some 3 million people, or more than half of the adult population of Ireland. In 1844, he visited Liverpool, Manchester and London with almost equal success. 

While Father Mathew founded the temperance movement in Ireland, it was part of a wider effort to improve the life chances of poor labourers. Teetotalism was first organised by the Preston Temperance Society, founded in 1833, and the organisations that followed had a huge worldwide impact in the 1800s. 

A biography, written shortly after his death, credits Mathew&#x27;s work with a reduction in Irish crime figures of the era:The number of homicides, which was 247 in 1838, was only 105 in 1841. There were 91 cases of &#x27;firing at the person&#x27; reported in 1837, and but 66 in 1841. The &#x27;assaults on police&#x27; were 91 in 1837, and but 58 in 1841. Incendiary fires, which were as many as 459 in 1838, were 390 in 1841. Robberies, thus specially reported, diminished from 725 in 1837, to 257 in 1841. The decrease in cases of &#x27;robbery of arms&#x27; was most significant; from being 246 in 1837, they were but 111 in 1841. The offence of &#x27;appearing in arms&#x27; showed a favourable diminution, falling from 110 in 1837, to 66 in 1841. The effect of sobriety on &#x27;faction fights&#x27; was equally remarkable. There were 20 of such cases in 1839, and 8 in 1841. The dangerous offence of &#x27;rescuing prisoners&#x27;, which was represented by 34 in 1837, had no return in 1841! The number committed to jail fell from 12,049 in 1839 to 9,875 by 1845. Sentences of death fell from 66 in 1839 to 14 in 1846, and transportations fell from 916 to 504 over the same period.

==In the United States==

Mathew visited the United States in 1849, returning in 1851. While there, he found himself at the centre of the abolitionist debate. Many of his hosts, including John Hughes, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, were anti-abolitionists and wanted assurances that Mathew would not stray outside his remit of battling alcohol consumption. But Mathew had signed a petition (along with 60,000 Irish people, including Daniel O&#x27;Connell) encouraging the Irish in the US not to partake in slavery in 1841 during Charles Lenox Remond&#x27;s tour of Ireland.

In order to avoid upsetting these anti-abolitionist friends in the US, he snubbed an invitation to publicly condemn chattel slavery, sacrificing his friendship with that movement. He defended his position by pointing out that there was nothing in the scripture that prohibited slavery. He was condemned by many on the abolitionist side, including the former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass who had received the pledge from Mathew in Cork in 1845. Douglass felt &quot;grieved, humbled and mortified&quot; by Mathew&#x27;s decision to ignore slavery while campaigning in the US and &quot;wondered how being a Catholic priest should inhibit him from denouncing the sin of slavery as much as the sin of intemperance&quot;. Douglass felt it was his duty to now &quot;denounce and expose the conduct of Father Mathew&quot;.
==Death==
Mathew died on 8 December 1856 in Queenstown, County Cork (present-day Cobh), and was interred in St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery, Cork, a cemetery which he had himself established.

==Father Mathew&#x27;s Tower==
In 1842, at his own expense, landowner William O&#x27;Connor built a castellated neo-Gothic stone tower to commemorate Father Mathew on what was then called Mount Patrick and is now known as Tower Hill in Glounthaune outside Cork city. The tower, which was subsequently converted into a private residence, retains a number of its original features, including a life-sized statue of Father Mathew in the tower&#x27;s garden. Around 2014, the refurbished and modernised tower was sold for approximately one million euro. An eyewitness description of the tower, from the summer of 1848, is included in Asenath Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Annals of the Famine in Ireland in 1847, 1848 and 1849&quot;.

<text>The Jedwabne pogrom was a massacre of Polish Jews in the town of Jedwabne, German-occupied Poland, on 10 July 1941, during World War II and the early stages of the Holocaust. Estimates of the number of victims vary from 300 to 1,600, including women, children, and elderly, many of whom were locked in a barn and burned alive. 

At least 40 ethnic Poles carried out the killing; their ringleaders decided on it beforehand with Germany&#x27;s Gestapo, SS security police or SS intelligence, and they cooperated with German military police. According to historian Jan T. Gross, &quot;the undisputed bosses of life and death in Jedwabne were the Germans,&quot; who were &quot;the only ones who could decide the fate of the Jews.&quot;

Knowledge of the massacre did not become widespread until 1999–2003. Polish filmmakers, journalists, and academics, in particular Gross&#x27;s history &quot;&quot; (2001) raised public interest. In 2000–2003 Poland&#x27;s Institute of National Remembrance conducted a forensic murder investigation; it confirmed that the direct perpetrators were ethnic Poles. The country was shocked by the findings, which challenged common narratives about the Holocaust in Poland that had focused on Polish suffering and heroism, and that non-Jewish Poles had little responsibility for the fate of Poland&#x27;s Jews.

In a 2001 memorial ceremony at Jedwabne, President Aleksander Kwaśniewski apologized on behalf of the country, an apology that was repeated in 2011 by President Bronisław Komorowski. With the Law and Justice (PIS) party&#x27;s rise to political power in 2015, the subject again became contentious. The PIS has a controversial &quot;history policy&quot;; President Andrzej Duda publicly criticized Komorowski&#x27;s apology.

==Background==
===Jedwabne===

The Jewish community in Jedwabne was established in the 17th or 18th century. In 1937, 60 percent of the population were ethnic Poles and 40 percent Jewish. In 1939 the total population was around 2,720 to 2,800. At the time about 10 percent of the population of Poland—35 million—was Jewish; it was the largest Jewish population in the world.

Many in the region supported the National Party branch of the National Democracy movement, a right-wing and antisemitic bloc which sought to counter what it claimed was Jewish economic competition against Catholics and opposed the Polish socialist government of Józef Piłsudski and his successors. Prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good before 1939. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge. Jews anticipated a pogrom, but the local priest and rabbi stepped in and addressed the matter together.

According to Polish journalist Anna Bikont, residents of Jedwabne knew of the 1933 Radziłów pogrom in nearby Radziłów, organized by National Democracy&#x27;s far-right Camp of Great Poland (&quot;OWP&quot;) faction. The organization referred to the violence as a &quot;revolution&quot; against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists, and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the &quot;OWP&quot; was then banned by Poland&#x27;s government for anti-state and racist activities. Archival documents show Poland&#x27;s government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter&#x27;s attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them – arresting violent nationalists – and perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.

===World War II===

World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany. Later that month, the Soviet Red Army invaded the eastern regions of Poland under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The Germans transferred the area around Jedwabne to the Soviets in accordance with the German–Soviet Boundary Treaty of 28 September 1939. Anna M. Cienciala writes that most of the Jews understandably welcomed the Soviets as the &quot;lesser evil than the Germans&quot;, though the Orthodox Jewish majority rejected their ideology, and businesspersons and the assimilated Jewish intelligentsia did not trust their intentions; and soon enough the Soviets had moved against the Jewish intelligentsia, arrested leaders of the Jewish Bund, and nationalized private businesses. According to NKVD (Soviet secret police) documents about Jedwabne and the surrounding area, &quot;few Jews were involved as agents and informers, fewer in fact than Poles&quot;, Cienciala writes. Some younger Jews did accept roles within the lower ranks of Soviet administration and militia, for &quot;they believed in the Communist slogans of equality and social justice, while also welcoming the chance to become upwardly mobile.&quot; Nevertheless, what stuck in Poles&#x27; minds was &quot;the image of Jews welcoming the Soviets&quot;, and the collaboration of some communist Jews with the NKVD.

Anna Bikont writes that under Soviet occupation the Poles and Jews of Jedwabne had differing experiences of the local militia, which provided the authorities with names of anti-communist and antisemitic National Party members: &quot;Polish accounts repeated that [the militia was] made up of Jews. The Jews themselves talk about Jews who made themselves of service to the Soviets in this first period, but they emphasize that [those Jews] were the exception rather than the rule.&quot; Regardless of the extent of the collaboration, it &quot;strengthened the widely held stereotype of Judaeo-communism promoted by right-wing parties before the war&quot;, write Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki. Krzysztof Persak writes that the antisemitic stereotype of Jewish Communism used by the National Party before the war conditioned the view of Jews as Soviet collaborators; the Soviet departure then triggered revenge: &quot;Even though the Germans were in control of the situation in Jedwabne, there is no doubt that it was not hard to find dozens of willing participants of genocidal murder among the local Poles... After two years of cruel occupation, the local Poles greeted the Wehrmacht as liberators. They also felt a strong revenge reflex toward Soviet collaborators, with Jews viewed as such &quot;en bloc&quot;. The attitude to the latter was conditioned by anti-Semitism, which was widespread in the area... As a result of a combination of all those factors, German inspiration and encouragement in Jedwabne met with favorable conditions.&quot;

Following Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, German forces again overran Jedwabne and other parts of Poland that had been occupied by the Soviets. American historian Christopher Browning writes: &quot;Criminal orders from above and violent impulses from below created a climate of unmitigated violence.

===Spate of pogroms===
Shortly after the German invasion of Soviet-held Polish territory in late June 1941, Heinrich Himmler, the most powerful Nazi after Adolf Hitler, complained that pogroms had not broken out in the newly conquered Polish region where Jedwabne is located. 

The complaint was responded to by Himmler&#x27;s subordinate, Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office commanding the German Security Police, or &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot;, which in turn controlled Germany&#x27;s SS paramilitary death squads, or &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. Heydrich issued orders on 29 June and 2 July 1941 applying to newly-captured Polish territory previously controlled by the Soviets. These were for German forces to support &quot;self-cleansing actions&quot; by local anti-Semitic activists and anti-communists against people alleged to have collaborated with the Soviet occupation — Polish communists and Jews. Instigation of massacres in the newly-conquered region were a part of the German extermination operation, and documents show a pattern of similarity between them.

Heydrich ordered: &quot;No obstacles should be made for the efforts aimed at self-cleaning among anti-communist and anti-Jewish circles in the newly occupied territories. To the contrary, they should be instigated without leaving a trace, and if need be—intensified and directed on the right track, but in such a manner so that the local ‘self-defense circles’ could not refer to the orders or political promises made to them.&quot;

Holocaust historian Peter Longerich wrote in 2007: &quot;Even if the murders were carried out by local people - or more precisely by a group of forty or so men, distinct from other members of the indigenous population, mostly not from the town itself but from the surrounding area - closer analysis of the crime has now demonstrated that the pogrom was engineered by a unit of the German Security Police. This was probably a commando from the Gestapo office in Zichenau that had been assigned to Einsatzgruppe B as an auxiliary troop and which had organized several pogroms in the western part of the Voivodeship of Bialystok (in which Jedwabne was located); it had recruited local Poles as auxiliary &#x27;pogrom police&#x27; for this purpose.&quot;

After the German occupation, Polish villagers participated in pogroms against Jews in 23 localities of the Łomża and Białystok areas of the Podlasie region, with varying degrees of German involvement. Generally smaller attacks took place at Bielsk Podlaski (the village of Pilki), Choroszcz, Czyżew, Goniądz, Grajewo, Jasionówka, Kleszczele, Knyszyn, Kolno, Kuźnica, Narewka, Piątnica, Radziłów, Rajgród, Sokoły, Stawiski, Suchowola, Szczuczyn, Trzcianne, Tykocin, Wasilków, Wąsosz, and Wizna. On 5 July 1941, during the Wąsosz pogrom, Polish residents knifed and beat to death about 150–250 Jews. Two days later, during the Radziłów pogrom, local Poles are reported to have murdered 800 Jews, 500 of whom were burned in a barn. The murders took place after the Gestapo had arrived in the towns. 

Writing in 2011, historians Bert Hoppe and Hiltrud Glass observed that in all massacres in German-occupied territories, there are indications of the leading role of German units even where non-Germans were the murderers, such as in Jedwabne. 

In the days before the Jedwabne massacre, the town&#x27;s Jewish population increased as refugees arrived from nearby Radziłów and Wizna. In Wizna, the town&#x27;s Polish &quot;civil head&quot; (&quot;wójt&quot;) had ordered the Jewish community&#x27;s expulsion; 230–240 Jews fled to Jedwabne.

According to various accounts, Persak writes, the Germans had set up a &quot;Feldgendarmerie&quot; in Jedwabne, staffed by eight or eleven military police. The police reportedly set up a &quot;collaborationist civilian town council&quot; led by a former mayor, Marian Karolak. Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowski and Jerzy Laudanski. The town council is reported to have included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, Józef Sobutka, and Józef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.

Persak writes that the area around Łomża and western Białystok was one of the few Polish-majority areas that had, since 1939, been experiencing the cruelty of Soviet occupation. Thus, when the Germans arrived in 1941, the population saw them as liberators; together with historical antisemitism, this created conditions ripe for German incitement.

==Jedwabne pogrom (1941)==
===10 July 1941===

There is general agreement that German secret police or intelligence officials were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council. Szmuel Wasersztajn&#x27;s witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities. Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and &quot;they began to talk in the town hall&quot;. &quot;Gestapo man&quot; was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town&#x27;s Jews.

According to the IPN&#x27;s report, on 10 July 1941 Polish men from nearby villages began arriving in Jedwabne &quot;with the intention of participating in the premeditated murder of the Jewish inhabitants of the town&quot;. Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Laudański and Karol Bardoń, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet NKVD and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans. He also writes that no &quot;sustained organized activity&quot; could have taken place in the town without the Germans&#x27; consent.

The town&#x27;s Jews were forced out of their homes and taken to the market square, where they were ordered to weed the area by pulling up grass from between the cobblestones. While doing this, they were beaten and made to dance or perform exercises by residents from Jedwabne and nearby. 
Evoking the antisemitic stereotype of &quot;Żydokomuna&quot; against their victims, who they alleged had collaborated with the Soviet regime, 40–50 Jewish men were forced to demolish a statue of Lenin in a nearby square and carry part of the statue on a wooden stretcher to the market square then to a nearby barn, while singing communist songs. The local rabbi, Awigdor Białostocki, and the kosher butcher, Mendel Nornberg, led the procession. According to an eyewitness, Szmuel Wasersztajn, the group was taken to the barn, where they were made to dig a pit and throw the statue in. They were then killed and buried in the same pit. Polish government investigators found this grave during a partial exhumation in 2001. It held the remains of about 40 men, a kosher butcher&#x27;s knife, and the head of the concrete Lenin statue.

Most of Jedwabne&#x27;s remaining Jews, around 300 men, women, children and infants, were then locked inside the barn, which was set on fire, probably using kerosene from former Soviet supplies. This group was buried in the barn near the first group. The 2001 exhumation found a mass grave within the barn&#x27;s foundations and another close to the foundations.

Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.

===Survivors===
The IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that &quot;a collective action was being prepared against the Jews&quot;. Between 100 and 125 Jews who escaped the pogrom lived in an open ghetto in Jedwabne before being transferred to the Łomża ghetto in November 1942. Several escaped to other towns. In November 1942, when the Germans began putting ghetto inmates on trains to the Auschwitz concentration camp for extermination, seven of them—Moshe Olszewicz, his wife, Lea, and his brother, Dov; Lea and Jacob Kubran; Józef Grądowski; and Szmuel Wasersztajn—escaped again to the nearby hamlet of Janczewko. There they were hidden by Antonina Wyrzykowska and Aleksander Wyrzykowski, on the couple&#x27;s farm, from November 1942 to January 1945. Despite a very &quot;aggressive attitude from Polish neighbours&quot; and inspections by German personnel, the Wyrzykowskis managed to hide the group until the Red Army liberated Janczewko from the German occupiers in January 1945. Shortly after, the Wyrzykowskis were beaten by a group of Polish nationalists for having helped Jews; the couple had to leave the area and eventually moved to Milanówek, near Warsaw.

==Early criminal investigations, 1949–1965==
===1949–1950 trials===

After the war, in 1949 and 1950, 22 suspects from the town and vicinity were put on trial in Poland, accused of collaborating with the Germans during the pogrom. None of the defendants had a higher education and three were illiterate. Twelve were convicted of treason against Poland and one was condemned to death. Some of the men confessed after being tortured during interviews with the Security Office (UB). The confessions were retracted in court and the accused were released. 

===German investigation, 1960–1965===
&quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Wolfgang Birkner was investigated by prosecutors in West Germany in 1960 on suspicion of involvement in the massacres of Jews in Jedwabne, Radziłów, and Wąsosz in 1941. The charges were based on research by Szymon Datner, head of the Białystok branch of the Central Committee of Polish Jews (CŻKH). The German prosecutors found no hard evidence implicating Birkner, but in the course of their investigation they discovered a new German witness, the former SS &quot;Kreiskommissar&quot; of Łomża, who named the paramilitary Einsatzgruppe B under SS-Obersturmführer Hermann Schaper as having been deployed in the area at the time of the pogroms. The methods used by Schaper&#x27;s death squad in the Radziłów massacre were identical to those employed in Jedwabne only three days later. During the German investigation at Ludwigsburg in 1964, Schaper lied to interrogators, claiming that in 1941 he had been a truck driver. Legal proceedings against the accused were terminated on 2 September 1965.

===Aftermath===
In 1963 a monument to the victims was placed in Jedwabne by the Polish communist state&#x27;s &quot;Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy&quot;. Its inscription blamed the Germans: &quot;The place of destruction of the Jewish population. Here Gestapo and Nazi gendarmes burned alive 1600 people on 10 July 1941.&quot;

According to Ewa Wolentarska-Ochman, &quot;although almost absent from Poland&#x27;s official historical record, the massacre remained very much alive in local oral tradition and among Jewish survivors from the region.&quot;

==Jan T. Gross&#x27;s &quot;Neighbors&quot;, 2000==

Jan T. Gross&#x27;s book &quot;Sąsiedzi: Historia zagłady żydowskiego miasteczka&quot; (&quot;Neighbors: The Story of the Annihilation of a Jewish Town&quot;) caused a &quot;moral earthquake&quot; when it was published in Poland in May 2000, according to Piotr Wróbel. It appeared in English, German and Hebrew within the year. In English it was published in April 2001 by Princeton University Press as &quot;Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland&quot;.

Writing that &quot;one day, in July 1941, half of the population of a small East European town murdered the other half—some 1,600 men, women and children&quot;, Gross concluded that the Jedwabne Jews had been rounded up and killed by a mob of their own Polish neighbors. This ran contrary to Poland&#x27;s official account that they had been killed by Germans. Political scientist Michael Shafir writes that the pogrom had been &quot;subjected to confinement in the Communist &#x27;black hole of history&#x27;&quot;. While Gross recognized that no &quot;sustained organizing activity&quot; could have taken place without the Germans&#x27; consent, he concluded that the massacre had been carried out entirely by Poles from Jedwabne and the surrounding area, and that the Germans had not coerced them.

Gross&#x27;s sources were Szmuel Wasersztajn&#x27;s 1945 witness statement from the Jewish Historical Institute; witness statements and other trial records from the 1949–1950 trials; the &quot;Yedwabne: History and Memorial Book&quot; (1980), written by Jedwabne residents who had moved to the United States; and interviews from the 1990s conducted by Gross and a filmmaker. While several Polish historians praised Gross for having drawn attention to the pogrom, others criticized him for relying too heavily on witness accounts, which they argued were not reliable, and—where conflicting accounts existed—for choosing those that showed the Poles in the worst possible light. He was also criticized for having failed to examine the pogrom within the context of German actions during the early stages of the Holocaust. According to Dan Stone, &quot;some historians sought to dispute the fundamentals of Gross&#x27;s findings by massive attention to minute details, burying the wider picture under a pile of supposed inaccuracies&quot;.

According to Ewa Wolentarska-Ochman, the publication of &quot;Neighbors&quot; &quot;[left] young generations... unable to comprehend how such a crime could be generally unknown and never spoken about in the last 50 years.&quot;

==Polish government investigation, 2000–2003==
===Exhumation===
In July 2000, following the publication of Gross&#x27;s book, the Polish parliament ordered a new investigation to be conducted by the Institute of National Remembrance –Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation (&quot;Instytut Pamięci Narodowej –Komisja Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu&quot;, or IPN).

In May–June 2001 the IPN conducted an exhumation at the site of the barn. Charred bodies were found in two mass graves, and broken pieces of the bust of Lenin. According to Dariusz Stola, &quot;experts agree that there are no more than 400–450 bodies. This figure is compatible with the size of the barn that constituted the killing site (19 × 7 meters, or 62 × 23 feet).&quot; The exhumation lasted just five days because of religious objections from Orthodox Jews; in &quot;Digging for the Disappeared&quot; (2015), Adam Rosenblatt writes that, because of this, what happened in Jedwabne &quot;is likely to remain forever murky&quot;. According to William Haglund, a forensic expert for Physicians for Human Rights, who attended the exhumation as an international observer, the process should have lasted several months. In his view, the number of bodies could not be estimated in the short space of time.

The Polish government had to compromise and agree that only the top layer and small fragments would be examined; large pieces of bone would not be moved. The exhumation reportedly ended, according to Haglund, &quot;with some of the non-Jewish Polish investigators weeping in frustration as they watched one of the rabbis lowering the charred teeth and bone fragments ... back into the graves&quot;.

===Interviews===
Over the course of two years, IPN investigators interviewed some 111 witnesses, mainly from Poland, but also from Israel and the United States. One-third of the IPN witnesses had been eyewitnesses of some part of the pogrom; most had been children at the time. The IPN also searched for documents in Polish archives in Warsaw, Białystok and Łomża, in German archives, and at Yad Vashem in Israel. During a visit to New York in January 2001, Leon Kieres, President of the IPN, said the IPN had found enough evidence to confirm that a group of Poles had been the perpetrators. In June 2001, the IPN said ammunition shells recovered from the site were German, prompting speculation that German soldiers had fired at Jews fleeing the barn, but the IPN later found that the shells were from a different historical period.

===Findings===

On 9 July 2002 the IPN issued a press release on the findings of its two-year investigation, signed by the chief prosecutor, Radosław J. Ignatiew. The IPN found that at least 340 Jews had been killed in the pogrom, in two groups. The first group consisted of 40 to 50 men, who were murdered before the barn was set on fire. The second group consisted of about 300 people of &quot;both sexes of various ages, including children and infants&quot;. The second group was &quot;led into a wooden, thatched barn owned by Bronisław Śleszyński. After the building had been closed, it was doused, probably with kerosene from the former Soviet warehouse.&quot; The exact number of victims could not be determined. The previously estimated figure of 1,600 &quot;seems highly unlikely, and was not confirmed in the course of the investigation&quot;.

The report concluded that the perpetrators of the crime &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;in the strict sense&quot;) were at least 40 male &quot;Polish inhabitants of Jedwabne and its environs&quot;. Responsibility for the crime &quot;sensu largo&quot; (&quot;in the broad sense&quot;) could be ascribed to the Germans because of the presence of German military policemen at the Jedwabne police station. Their presence, &quot;though passive, was tantamount to consent to and tolerance of the crime against the Jewish inhabitants of the town&quot;.

Several witnesses had testified that uniformed Germans had arrived in the town that day and drove the group of Jews to the market place. IPN could neither conclusively prove nor disprove these accounts. &quot;Witness testimonies vary considerably&quot; on the question of whether the Germans took the Jews to the barn or were present there. The IPN found that the &quot;Polish population&quot; had played a &quot;decisive role in the execution of the criminal plan&quot;. The IPN wrote: &quot;On the basis of the evidence gathered in the investigation, it is not possible to determine the reasons for the passive behavior of the majority of the town&#x27;s population in the face of the crime. In particular, it cannot be determined whether this passivity resulted from acceptance of the crime or from intimidation caused by the brutality of the perpetrators&#x27; acts.&quot;

Leon Kieres delivered the IPN report to the Polish parliament. A small opposition party, the League of Polish Families (LPR) called him a &quot;servant of the Jews&quot; and blamed him and President Aleksander Kwaśniewski for &quot;stoning the Polish nation&quot;. LPR MP Antoni Macierewicz made an official complaint against the IPN&#x27;s conclusion that ethnic Poles and not the Germans had committed the massacre. A 203-page expanded version of the findings was issued by the IPN on 30 June 2003; pages 60–160 contained summaries of the testimonies of witnesses interviewed by the IPN. The report was supplemented by two volumes of studies and documents, &quot;Wokół Jedwabnego&quot; (Vol. 1: &quot;Studies&quot;, 525 pages, and Vol. 2: &quot;Documents&quot;, 1,034 pages. On 30 June 2003 Ignatiew announced that the investigation of &quot;the mass murder of at least 340 Polish citizens of Jewish nationality in Jedwabne on July 10, 1941&quot; had found no living suspects who had not already been brought to justice, and therefore the IPN investigation was closed.

===2019 IPN statement===
Jaroslaw Szarek, director of Poland&#x27;s Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), said in February 2019 that the IPN was ready to re-open the investigation and exhume the remaining bodies, but the National Prosecutor&#x27;s Office decided in March that there were no grounds for doing so.

===Recognizing the Wyrzykowskis===
In January 1976 Antonina Wyrzykowska and Aleksander Wyrzykowski were recognized as Righteous Among the Nations medal by the Israeli Yad Vashem institution.

===President&#x27;s apology===

In July 2001, on the 60th anniversary of the pogrom, Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski attended a ceremony at Jedwabne where he apologized for the massacre: &quot;We can have no doubt that here in Jedwabne Polish citizens were killed at the hands of fellow citizens ... I apologise in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is shattered by that crime.&quot; The ceremony was attended by Catholic and Jewish religious leaders and survivors of the pogrom. Most of the 2,000 locals of Jedwabne, including the town&#x27;s priest, boycotted the ceremony in protest against the apology.

Shevah Weiss, Israeli Ambassador to Poland, also delivered a speech. &quot;Living among us also are Holocaust survivors whose lives were saved as a result of the brave actions of their Polish neighbors,&quot; he said. He praised Poland&#x27;s investigation. Former Polish president Lech Walesa said at the time: &quot;The Jedwabne crime was a revenge for the cooperation of the Jewish community with the Soviet occupant. The Poles have already apologized many times to the Jews; we are waiting for the apology from the other side because many Jews were scoundrels.&quot;

===New monument===
The Jedwabne monument was replaced in July 2001 by a six-foot-tall stone with an inscription, in Hebrew, Polish, and Yiddish, that makes no mention of the perpetrators: &quot;To the Memory of Jews from Jedwabne and the Surrounding Area, Men, Women, and Children, Co-inhabitants of this Land, Who Were Murdered and Burned Alive on This Spot on July 10, 1941.&quot; The memorial stone is surrounded by a series of stone blocks that mark the site of the barn. In August 2001 Jedwabne mayor Krzysztof Godlewski, a pioneer for the commemoration of the massacre, resigned in protest at the local council&#x27;s refusal to fund a new road to the site. He received the Jan Karski Award in 2002, along with Rabbi Jacob Baker, author of &quot;Yedwabne: History and Memorial Book&quot; (1980).

===Asking for forgiveness===
On 11 July 2011 Poland&#x27;s President Bronisław Komorowski asked for forgiveness at a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary. In September that year, the Jedwabne memorial was defaced with swastikas and graffiti. Poland launched an anti-hate crime investigation.

===Influence on political discourse===
In Poland&#x27;s 2015 presidential election campaign debate, the future president, Andrzej Duda, criticized his rival, then-president Bronisław Komorowski, for &quot;failure to defend Poland&#x27;s reputation&quot; and for apologizing for the massacre of Jews by Poles at the Jedwabne pogrom.

Writing on Poland&#x27;s ruling party and its historical policy, Joanna Michlic explains that &quot;according to the politicians, historians, and journalists representing PiS&#x27;s ideological position, Jedwabne and other events that cast a negative light on Polish national identity must be revisited and retold for both Poles and the West. In their eyes, Jedwabne is a key sign of &#x27;all the lies voiced against the Polish nation,&#x27; and is understood as the &#x27;central attack&#x27; on Polishness, Polish values and traditions, and Polish identity (understood in an ethnic sense).&quot;

Jörg Hackmann states that &quot;three major explanations of the murders of Jedwabne prevail: First, that responsibility has to be seen within the Polish society... Second, [rejection of a] connection between the murders and a general Polish antisemitism [and insistence on] the image of the Pole being an &quot;innocent and noble victim of foreign violence and intrigue&quot; by Hitler and Stalin alike. And third, ... [a] the thesis of ascribing the responsibility solely to the Germans, which in 2016 was repeated by the current director of IPN, Jarosław Szarek...&quot; Hackmann emphasizes the &quot;symbolic meaning of Jedwabne for the Polish debate on World War II&quot;, quoting Joanna Michlic: &quot;Jedwabne on the one hand, &quot;has become the key symbol of the counter-memory of the old, hegemonic, biased narratives of the Holocaust&quot;... On the other hand, Jedwabne has been regarded by the critics of Jan Gross as embodiment of &quot;&#x27;all the lies voiced against the Polish nation,&#x27; and is understood as the &#x27;central attack&#x27; on Polishness, Polish values and traditions, and Polish identity.&quot;&quot; He summarizes that &quot;in this context, Jedwabne has been repeatedly addressed as [a] core feature of a &quot;pedagogy of disgrace&quot; (&quot;pedagogika wstydu&quot;).&quot;

==Media==

Polish film-maker Agnieszka Arnold made two documentary films interviewing witnesses of the massacre. &quot;Gdzie mój starszy syn Kain&quot; (&quot;Where is my elder son Cain&quot;, 1999), includes interviews with Szmul Wasersztajn and the daughter of the owner of the barn where the massacre took place. The second, &quot;Sąsiedzi&quot; (&quot;Neighbors&quot;, 2001), deals with the subject in greater depth. Gross&#x27;s book of the same name was written with Arnold&#x27;s permission to use the title. Gross appears in Haim Hecht&#x27;s documentary &quot;Two Barns&quot; (2014), along other prominent Holocaust historians (Yehuda Bauer, Jan Grabowski, and Havi Dreifuss), as well as Wislawa Szymborska and Shevah Weiss.

===&quot;Wokół Jedwabnego&quot; (2002)===
&quot;Wokół Jedwabnego&quot; (&quot;On Jedwabne&quot;) is an official two-volume Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) publication, edited by Paweł Machcewicz and Krzysztof Persak. Volume 1, &quot;Studies&quot; (525 pages) contains historical and legal research by IPN historians. Volume 2, &quot;Documents&quot; (1,034 pages), contains original documents collected by the IPN investigation.

===&quot;The Neighbors Respond&quot; (2003)===
An extensive collection of articles from the Polish and international debate, in English translation, was published in 2003 as &quot;The Neighbors Respond: The Controversy over the Jedwabne Massacre in Poland&quot; by Joanna Michlic and Antony Polonsky of Brandeis University. The book includes articles from Polish and other historians, the IPN&#x27;s findings, and essays from Polish newspapers such as &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; and &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;. The collection features archival documents and essays covering the entire 1939–1941 period. Contributors include Anna Bikont, David Engel, Israel Gutman, Adam Michnik, Bogdan Musial, Dariusz Stola, and Tomasz Strzembosz.

===&quot;My z Jedwabnego&quot; (2004)===
The French translation of Anna Bikont’s book &quot;My z Jedwabnego&quot; (2004) (&quot;Jedwabne: Battlefield of Memory”), won the European Book Prize in 2011 as &quot;Le crime et le silence&quot;. The English translation &quot;The Crime and the Silence: Confronting the Massacre of Jews in Wartime Jedwabne&quot; was published in 2015. Other translations include Swedish (2015), Hebrew (2016), Dutch (2016), Chinese (2018), Italian (2019) and German (2020).

===&quot;The Massacre in Jedwabne, 10 July 1941&quot; (2005)===
Marek Jan Chodakiewicz&#x27;s book &quot;The Massacre in Jedwabne, 10 July 1941: Before, During, and After&quot; challenges Gross&#x27;s interpretation of events. It suggests that four or five truckloads of armed SS men from Łomża terrorized the local population before leading Jews and Poles to the crime scene. Chodakiewicz argues that all the primary sources are wrong or worthless, including the testimony of Szmul Wasersztajn, the investigation of the 22 suspects for the 1949 trial, and the partial exhumation of the bodies. &quot;And yet,&quot; Piotr Wróbel wrote in &quot;The Sarmatian Review&quot;, &quot;Chodakiewicz is able to present his recreation of the crime. It was well preplanned, initiated by the Germans, and utterly lacked any pogrom-like spontaneity.&quot; Chodakiewicz&#x27;s good arguments, Wróbel wrote, are &quot;overshadowed by numerous flaws&quot;, lack a sense of proportion, and make selective use of information from sources that support Chodakiewicz&#x27;s view. According to Wróbel, the book has a &quot;visible political agenda&quot; and is &quot;difficult to read, unoriginal, irritating, and unconvincing&quot;.

Reviewing the book for &quot;History&quot;, Peter D. Stachura agreed with Chodakiewicz that the pogrom had been executed by German police, &quot;with only limited involvement from a very small number of Poles&quot;, including &quot;&quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; (Polish citizens of German origin) and petty criminals&quot;. In response, Joanna Michlic and Antony Polonsky complained about the review to the editor of &quot;History&quot;. Chodakiewicz&#x27;s and Stachura&#x27;s conclusions were &quot;very far from those reached by most historians&quot;, they wrote, including the IPN. Chodakiewicz and Stachura &quot;uphold a view of the Polish past which seeks to return to an untenable vision of modern Poland as solely victim and hero ... It is a matter of considerable regret to us that you have allowed your journal to be used to advance this neo-nationalist agenda.&quot;

===&quot;Our Class&quot; (2009)===
A 2009 play, &quot;Our Class&quot; by Polish playwright Tadeusz Słobodzianek, dealing with a massacre of Jews by Poles in a small town during the Holocaust, was performed in London. The play follows the lives of 10 Catholic and Jewish Polish students from the same class at school, beginning in 1925.

<text>Hippolyte Hélyot (January 1660 – 5 January 1716) was a Franciscan friar and priest of the Franciscan Third Order Regular and a major scholar of church history, focusing on the history of the religious Orders.

Hélyot was born at Paris in January 1660, supposedly of English ancestry, and christened Pierre at his birth. After spending his youth in study, he entered, in his twenty-fourth year, the friary of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, founded in Picpus – now part of Paris – by his uncle, Jérôme Hélyot, a canon regular of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher. There he took the religious name under which he gained his reputation as a historian.

Two journeys to Rome on business of the Order afforded him the opportunity of traveling over most of Italy; and after his final return he saw much of France, while acting as secretary to various provincial superiors of his Order. Both in Italy and France he was engaged in collecting materials for his great work, which occupied him for about twenty-five years. It was titled &quot;L&#x27;Histoire des ordres monastiques, religieux et militaires, et des congregations séculières de l&#x27;un et de l&#x27;autre sexe, qui ont été établis jusqu&#x27;à présent&quot; (&quot;The History of the Religious and Military Monastic Orders, and of the Secular Congregations of both Sexes, which have been established up to the Present Day&quot;). &quot;L&#x27;Histoire&quot; was published in eight volumes between 1714 and 1719. Jean-Baptiste Coignard of Paris printed the first two volumes for Joseph Derbais of Douay; Coignard published the remaining six volumes under his own name.

Hélyot died on 5 January 1716, before the fifth volume appeared, but his friend and colleague, Friar Maximilien Bullot, T.O.R., completed the fifth volume and authored the remaining three volumes. Hélyot&#x27;s other noteworthy work is &quot;Le Chrétien mourant&quot; (1695).

His &quot;History&quot; is a work of first importance, being the great repository of information regarding the general history of the religious orders up to the end of the 17th century. Hélyot gave detailed information about the foundation – and, where appropriate, the decline – of the various groups. It is profusely illustrated by large plates exhibiting the religious habits of the various Orders, and in the edition of 1792 the plates are colored. It was translated into Italian (1737) and into German (1753). The material was arranged in an alphabetical dictionary form by M. L. Badiche, for inclusion in Migne&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie théologique&quot;, under the title &quot;Dictionnaire des ordres religieux&quot; (5 vols., 1858).

<text>Jacques Paul Migne (; 25 October 1800 – 24 October 1875) was a French priest who published inexpensive and widely distributed editions of theological works, encyclopedias, and the texts of the Church Fathers, with the goal of providing a universal library for the Catholic priesthood.

The &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; and the &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot; (along with the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot;) are among the great 19th century contributions to the scholarship of patristics and the Middle Ages. Within the Roman Catholic Church, Migne&#x27;s editions put many original texts for the first time into the hands of the priesthood.

==Biography==
Migne was born in Saint-Flour, Cantal and studied theology at the University of Orléans. He was ordained in 1824 and placed in charge of the parish of Puiseaux, in the diocese of Orléans, where his uncompromisingly Catholic and royalist sympathies did not coincide with local patriotism and the new regime of the Citizen-King. In 1833, after falling out with his bishop over a pamphlet he had published, he went to Paris, and on 3 November started a journal, , which he intended to keep free of political influence. It quickly gained 1,800 subscribers and he edited it for three years. (It afterwards became his co-editor Louis Veuillot&#x27;s ultramontane organ, .) Migne was, until June 1856, owner of the daily (formerly the ), which, being limited to reproducing other newspapers, described itself as the impartial echo of all opinions.

Migne believed in the power of the press and the value of information widely distributed. In 1836 he opened his great publishing house, the , at Petit-Montrouge, in Paris&#x27;s outlying 14th arrondissement. He published numerous religious works in rapid succession meant for lesser clergy at prices that ensured wide circulation, and bypassed the bookselling establishment with direct subscriptions. These works were reproduced from the best available texts, generally without requesting permission. His publishing house was complemented during the Second Empire by painter artists&#x27; workhalls for the decoration of churches: three of their main works, in the style of Eugène Delacroix, still remain in the choir of the church of Saint John the Baptist of Audresselles in Pas de Calais, France. The also produced and sold a variety of religious items.

In time, the became the largest privately held press in France. However, on the night of 12–13 February 1868, a devastating fire, which began in the printing plant, destroyed Migne&#x27;s establishment. &quot;Five hundred thousand plates, stacked in piles, melted in an instant; they are now enormous blocks on the most bizarre forms,&quot; reported . Despite his insurance contracts, Migne was only able to retrieve a pittance.

Shortly afterwards, Georges Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, forbade the continuance of the business and even suspended Migne from his priestly functions. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 inflicted further losses. Then from the curia of Pope Pius IX came a decree condemning the use of Mass stipends to purchase books, which specifically called out Migne and his publications.

Migne died in Paris. He died without ever regaining his former success and his passed in 1876 into the hands of Garnier Frères.

== A complete edition of patrology==
The best known of his publications are: &quot;Scripturae sacrae cursus completus&quot; (&quot;complete course in sacred scripture&quot;) which assembled a wide repertory of commentaries on each of the books of the Bible, and &quot;Theologiae cursus&quot;, each of them in 28 vols, 1840–45; &quot;Collection des auteurs sacrés&quot; (100 vols., 1846–48); &quot;Encyclopédie théologique&quot; (171 vols., 1844–46).

However, the three great series that have made his reputation were &quot;Patrologiae cursus completus&quot;, Latin series (&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;) in 221 vols. (1844–55); Greek series (&quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;), first published in Latin (85 vols., 1856–57); then published with Greek text and Latin translation (165 vols., 1857–58). Though scholars have always criticised them, these hastily edited, inexpensive, and widely distributed texts have only slowly been replaced during a century and a half with more critically edited modern editions. The cheap paper of the originals has made them fragile today, but the scope of the &quot;Patrologia&quot; still makes it unique and valuable when modern editions do not yet exist. It is a far more complete collection of Patristic and later literature than anything that has appeared subsequently. To create so much so quickly, Migne reprinted the best or latest earlier editions available to him. In the &quot;PG&quot; the Latin translations were often made in the renaissance before any Greek text had been printed, and so do not necessarily match the Greek text very accurately. The indexes themselves are useful for locating references in the patristic writings.

The collection is available through Google Books and archive.org.

==Summary of publications==
Migne&#x27;s &quot;Ateliers catholiques&quot; employed 5 steam-powered presses, and by 1854 some 596 workers. On average, it published a book every ten days for thirty years. In summary these were:

* &quot;Orateurs sacrés&quot; in two series, 66 and 33 volumes

<text>&quot;The Fifth Modernization&quot; is an essay by human rights activist Wei Jingsheng, originally begun as a signed wall poster placed on the Democracy Wall in Beijing on December 5, 1978.

==Summary==
The poster called on the Chinese Communist Party to add democracy to the list of the Four Modernizations, which already included industry, agriculture, science and technology, and national defense. It openly stated democracy was an additional modernization that needed to be pursued if China truly wanted to modernize itself.

<doc id="103174" wikidata="Q598060" url="?curid=103174" title="Peter Martyr Vermigli">
<text>Peter Martyr Vermigli (; 8 September 149912 November 1562) was an Italian-born Reformed theologian. His early work as a reformer in Catholic Italy and his decision to flee for Protestant northern Europe influenced some other Italians to convert and flee as well. In England, he influenced the Edwardian Reformation, including the Eucharistic service of the 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. He was considered an authority on the Eucharist among the Reformed churches, and engaged in controversies on the subject by writing treatises. Vermigli&#x27;s &quot;Loci Communes&quot;, a compilation of excerpts from his biblical commentaries organised by the topics of systematic theology, became a standard Reformed theological textbook.

Born in Florence, Vermigli entered a religious order and was appointed to influential posts as abbot and prior. He came in contact with leaders of the Italian &quot;spirituali&quot; reform movement, and read Protestant theologians such as Martin Bucer and Ulrich Zwingli. Through reading these works and studying the Bible and the Church Fathers, he came to accept Protestant beliefs about salvation and the Eucharist. To satisfy his conscience and avoid persecution by the Roman Inquisition, he fled Italy for Protestant northern Europe. He ultimately arrived in Strasbourg where he taught on the Old Testament of the Bible under Bucer. English reformer Thomas Cranmer invited him to take an influential post at Oxford University where he continued to teach the Bible. He also defended his Eucharistic beliefs against Catholic proponents of transubstantiation in a public disputation. Vermigli was forced to leave England on the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary. As a Marian exile he returned to Strasbourg and his former teaching position. Vermigli&#x27;s beliefs regarding the Eucharist and predestination clashed with those of leading Lutherans in Strasbourg, so he transferred to Reformed Zürich where he taught until his death in 1562.

Vermigli&#x27;s best-known theological contribution was defending the Reformed doctrine of the Eucharist against Catholics and Lutherans. Contrary to the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, Vermigli did not believe that the bread and wine are changed into Christ&#x27;s body and blood. He also disagreed with the Lutheran view that Christ&#x27;s body is ubiquitous and so can be present in the Eucharist. Instead, Vermigli taught that Christ remains in Heaven even though he is offered to those who partake of the Eucharist and received by believers.

Vermigli developed a strong doctrine of predestination independently of John Calvin. His interpretation was that God&#x27;s will determines election and the reprobation of the non-elect. Vermigli&#x27;s belief is similar but not identical to Calvin&#x27;s. Vermigli&#x27;s political theology was important in the Elizabethan religious settlement; he provided theological justification for royal supremacy, the doctrine that the king of a territory, rather than any ecclesiastical authority, rules the church.

==Life==
===Early life (1499–1525)===

Vermigli was born in Florence, the centre of the Florentine Republic, on 8 September 1499 to Stefano di Antonio Vermigli, a wealthy shoemaker, and Maria Fumantina. He was christened Piero Mariano the following day. He was the eldest of three children; his sister Felicita Antonio was born in 1501 and his brother Antonio Lorenzo Romulo was born in 1504. His mother taught him Latin before enrolling him in a school for children of noble Florentines. She died in 1511, when Piero was twelve. Vermigli was attracted to the Catholic priesthood from an early age. In 1514 he became a novice at the Badia Fiesolana, a monastery of the Canons Regular of the Lateran. The Lateran Canons were one of several institutions born out of a fifteenth-century religious reform movement. They emphasised strict discipline, and could be transferred from house to house rather than being bound to stability in one place, as was the custom of Benedictine monasticism. They also sought to provide ministry in urban areas. Peter&#x27;s sister followed him into the monastic life, becoming a nun the same year.

On completing his novitiate in 1518, Vermigli took the name Peter Martyr after the thirteenth-century Dominican Saint Peter of Verona. The Lateran Congregation had recently decided that promising young ordinands should be sent to the monastery of Saint John of Verdara in Padua to study Aristotle, so Vermigli was sent there. The University of Padua, with which Saint John of Verdera was loosely affiliated, was a highly prestigious institution at the time. At Padua, Vermigli received a thorough training in Thomistic scholasticism and an appreciation for Augustine and Christian humanism. Vermigli was determined to read Aristotle in his original language despite the lack of Greek teachers, so he taught himself. He also made the acquaintance of prominent reform-minded theologians Pietro Bembo, Reginald Pole, and Marcantonio Flaminio.

===Early Italian ministry (1525–1536)===
Vermigli was ordained in 1525 and probably received his Doctor of Divinity around that time. The chapter-general of the Congregation elected him to the office of public preacher in 1526. His first series of sermons was in Brescia later that year. He then preached for three years, travelling around northern and central Italy. Unlike the practice of other preaching orders which usually only preached at Lent and Advent, the Augustinians preached year-round. He also gave lectures on the Bible as well as Homer in Lateran Congregation houses.

In 1530 Vermigli was appointed vicar of the monastery at San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. There he learned Hebrew from a local Jewish doctor so he could read the Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not unheard of. In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The discipline in the monastic houses in Vermigli&#x27;s care had been lax before his arrival, and they had become a source of scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of a power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, to the point that the bishop had excommunicated Vermigli&#x27;s predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and mended the relationship with the bishop.

The chapter general re-elected Vermigli to the Spoletan abbacy in 1534 and again in 1535, but he was not elected to lead any house the following year. He may have been identified as a promising reformer who could help with reform efforts in higher places. Vermigli was in contact with the Catholic leaders working on the &quot;Consilium de emendanda ecclesia&quot;, an internal report on potential reforms of the Church commissioned by Pope Paul III. He may have even travelled to Rome to assist in writing it.

===First controversial preaching and ministry in Lucca (1537–1541)===
The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of the monastery at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, a leader of the &quot;spirituali&quot; movement. Valdés introduced Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer&#x27;s commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through the study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés&#x27;s strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of either Gregory of Rimini or Thomas Aquinas at Padua.

Vermigli&#x27;s move away from orthodox Catholic belief became apparent in 1539 when he preached on 1 Corinthians 3:9–17, a passage commonly used as proof of the doctrine of purgatory. Vermigli did not take this view in his preaching, though he did not openly deny the existence of purgatory. Gaetano da Thiene, an opponent of the &quot;spirituali&quot;, reported his suspicions of Vermigli to the Spanish viceroy of Naples Don Pedro de Toledo, who prohibited Vermigli&#x27;s preaching. The prohibition was removed on Vermigli&#x27;s appeal to Rome, with which he received some help from powerful friends he had made in Padua, such as Cardinals Pole and Bembo. Despite this controversy, Vermigli continued to rise in the Lateran Congregation. He was made one of four visitors by the chapter general in 1540. The visitors assisted the rector general by inspecting the Congregation&#x27;s religious houses.
In 1541 the Congregation elected Vermigli to the important post of prior of Basilica of San Frediano in Lucca. The prior at San Frediano exercised some episcopal authority over half the city, as well as control of the Lateran&#x27;s religious houses. As at his earlier post in Spoleto, the monks of the San Frediano monastery, as well as the clergy of Lucca, were known for moral laxity, which led to an openness to the new Lutheran religion there. Vermigli saw his task as one of education as well as moral correction. He set up a college based on humanist principles of education and modelled on the newly founded St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Instruction was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Among the professors were the humanists Immanuel Tremellius, Paolo Lacizi, Celio Secondo Curione, and Girolamo Zanchi, all of whom would later convert to Protestantism. The Congregation recognised Vermigli&#x27;s work by appointing him to a disciplinary commission of seven canons in May 1542.

===Flight from Italy and first Strasbourg professorship (1542–1547)===
Vermigli was widely respected and very cautious. He was able to continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with Emperor Charles V in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist. The reconstitution of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 may have been in part a response to the fear that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the Republic of Lucca began to fear that their political independence from the Holy Roman Empire was at stake if their city continued to be viewed as a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books heretofore ignored were enforced, religious feasts which had been dropped were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca&#x27;s loyalty.

Vermigli was summoned to a Chapter Extraordinary of the Lateran Congregation, and his friends warned him that he had powerful adversaries. These increasingly foreboding events contributed to his decision to ignore the summons and flee, but he was finally persuaded by his conscience against the Masses he was bound to perform. Vermigli fled Lucca for Pisa on 12 August 1542 by horse with three of his canons. There he celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist for the first time. When he stopped in Florence, staying in Badia Fiesolana where he had entered religious life, Vermigli learned that Bernardino Ochino had arrived there. Vermigli convinced Ochino, a popular preacher with Protestant leanings, to flee Italy as well. On 25 August Vermigli left for Zürich by way of Ferrara and Verona.

Once Vermigli arrived in Zürich he was questioned regarding his theological views by several Protestant leaders including Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, and Rudolph Gualther. They eventually determined that he could be allowed to teach Protestant theology, but there was no position vacant for him to fill there or in Basel, where he went next. In a letter to his former congregation in Lucca, he explained his motives for leaving and also expressed discouragement at not being able to find a post. Basler humanist Bonifacius Amerbach assisted him with money, and reformer Oswald Myconius recommended him to Martin Bucer in Strasbourg, with whose writings Vermigli was already familiar. Vermigli moved to Strasbourg and became a close personal friend and ally of Bucer, who granted him the chair of Old Testament at the Senior School, succeeding Wolfgang Capito. He began by lecturing on the minor prophets, followed by Lamentations, Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. Vermigli was delighted to be able to teach from the original-language text of the Old Testament, as many of his students could read Hebrew. He was well-liked by his students and fellow scholars. Vermigli was known for precision, simplicity, and clarity of speech in contrast to Bucer&#x27;s propensity for digressions which sometimes left his students lost.

Two of Vermigli&#x27;s former colleagues in Lucca—Lacizi and Tremellius—would join him in Strasbourg. In 1544 he was elected canon of St. Thomas Church, Strasbourg. In 1545 Vermigli married his first wife, Catherine Dammartin, a former nun from Metz. Catherine knew no Italian, and Peter very little German, so it is assumed that they conversed in Latin.

===England (1547–1553)===

Edward VI acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there hoped to take the opportunity to more thoroughly reform the Church of England. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in the effort. In addition, the victory of the Catholic Emperor Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War and the resulting Augsburg Interim led to a hostile environment for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced Richard Smyth, becoming the second Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. This was a very influential post at a university which had been slow to accept reform.

On arriving in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist, the most sensitive area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli&#x27;s opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli at the forefront of debates over the nature of the Eucharist.

In 1549, a series of uprisings known as the Prayer Book Rebellion forced Vermigli to leave Oxford and take up residence at Lambeth Palace with Cranmer. The rebellion involved conservative opposition to a vernacular liturgy, which was imposed with the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; at Pentecost in 1549. Rioters in the streets of Oxford threatened Vermigli with death. At Lambeth, Vermigli assisted Cranmer by helping write sermons against the rebellion. After some time he returned to Oxford, where he was made first canon of Christ Church in January 1551. Vermigli, the first married priest at Oxford, caused controversy by bringing his wife into his rooms overlooking Fish Street at the Great Quadrangle. His windows were smashed several times until he moved to a location in the cloisters, where he built a fortified stone study.

Vermigli became deeply involved in English church politics. In 1550, he and Martin Bucer provided recommendations to Cranmer for additional changes to the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; Eucharistic liturgy. Vermigli supported the church&#x27;s position in the vestarian controversy, over whether bishop John Hooper should be forced to wear a surplice. Vermigli agreed with Hooper&#x27;s desire to rid the church of elaborate garments, but he did not believe they were strictly prohibited. He advised Hooper to respect the authority of his superiors. Vermigli was probably instrumental in convincing Hooper to drop his opposition in February 1551. In October 1551 he participated in a commission to rewrite the canon law of England. In the Winter he assisted in the writing of a draft set of such laws, which was published by John Foxe as &quot;Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum&quot; in 1552.

King Edward died in 1553, followed by the accession of Mary I of England, who opposed the Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest for six months, and his Catholic opponents at Oxford would likely have had him executed, as Cranmer eventually was in 1556. Despite this risk, he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned. Vermigli was able to receive permission from the Privy Council to leave England, and was advised by Cranmer to do so.

Vermigli&#x27;s wife, Catherine, had become well known in Oxford for her piety and ministry to expectant mothers. She also enjoyed carving faces into plum stones. She had died childless in the February before Vermigli left. Soon after Vermigli&#x27;s departure, Cardinal Pole had her body disinterred and thrown on a dungheap. Following the accession of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth in 1558, she was re-interred with the relics of Saint Frithuswith (Frideswide) in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.

===Strasbourg and Zürich (1553–1562)===
Vermigli arrived in Strasbourg in October 1553, where he was restored to his position at the Senior School and began lecturing on Judges as well as Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. Vermigli often gathered with other Marian exiles for study and prayer in his home. His lectures on Judges often addressed the political issues relevant for the exiles, such as the right to resist a tyrant. Since Vermigli&#x27;s departure and the death of Bucer in 1551, Lutheranism had gained influence in Strasbourg under the leadership of Johann Marbach. Vermigli had been asked to sign both the Augsburg Confession and the Wittenberg Concord as a condition of being reinstalled as professor. He was willing to sign the Augsburg Confession, but not the Concordat, which affirmed a bodily presence of Christ in the Eucharist. He was retained and reappointed anyway, but controversy over the Eucharist, as well as Vermigli&#x27;s strong doctrine of double predestination, continued with the Lutherans. Another professor in Strasbourg, Girolamo Zanchi, who had converted to Protestantism while under Vermigli in Lucca, shared Vermigli&#x27;s convictions regarding the Eucharist and predestination. Zanchi and Vermigli became friends and allies. Vermigli&#x27;s increasing alienation from the Lutheran establishment led him in 1556 to accept an offer from Heinrich Bullinger to teach at the Carolinum school in Zürich. John Jewel, a fellow Marian exile, came along with him.
In Zürich, Vermigli succeeded Konrad Pellikan as the chair of Hebrew, a position he would hold until his death. He married his second wife, Catarina Merenda of Brescia, Italy, in 1559. Vermigli was able to share his teaching duties with fellow Hebraist Theodor Bibliander, allowing him time to study and prepare the notes from his previous lectures for publication. He began lecturing on the books of Samuel and Kings. While in Zürich, Vermigli declined invitations to desirable positions in Geneva, Heidelberg, and England.

Vermigli&#x27;s Eucharistic views were accepted in Zürich, but he ran into controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed that in some way God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that those who believe in him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger&#x27;s position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli&#x27;s double predestinarian view, but Bibliander&#x27;s view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church&#x27;s orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders in December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.

Vermigli attended the abortive Colloquy at Poissy in the summer of 1561 with Theodore Beza, a conference held in France with the intention of reconciling Catholics and Protestants. He was able to converse with queen mother of France Catherine de&#x27;Medici in her native Italian. He contributed a speech on the Eucharist, arguing that Jesus&#x27; words &quot;this is my body&quot; at the Last Supper were figurative rather than literal. Vermigli&#x27;s health was already declining when he succumbed to an epidemic fever in 1562. He died on 12 November 1562 in his Zürich home, attended by the physician Conrad Gesner. He was buried in the Grossmünster cathedral, where his successor Josias Simler gave a funeral oration, which was published and is an important source for Vermigli&#x27;s later biographies. Vermigli had two children by his second wife, Caterina, while he was alive, but they did not survive infancy. Four months after his death she had their third child, Maria.

==Works==
Vermigli is best known for the &quot;Loci Communes&quot; (Latin for &quot;commonplaces&quot;), a collection of topical discussions scattered throughout his biblical commentaries. The &quot;Loci Communes&quot; was compiled by Huguenot minister Robert Masson and first published in 1576, fourteen years after Vermigli&#x27;s death. Vermigli had apparently expressed a desire to have such a book published, and it was urged along by the suggestion of Theodore Beza. Masson followed the pattern of John Calvin&#x27;s &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot; to organise it. Fifteen editions of the &quot;Loci Communes&quot; between 1576 and 1656 spread Vermigli&#x27;s influence among Reformed Protestants. Anthony Marten translated the &quot;Loci Communes&quot; into English in 1583, adding to it considerably.

Vermigli published commentaries on I Corinthians (1551), Romans (1558), and Judges (1561) during his lifetime. He was criticised by his colleagues in Strasbourg for withholding his lectures on books of the Bible for years rather than sending them to be published. Calling his lecture notes on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and the Minor Prophets &quot;brief and hasty annotations&quot;, he found it difficult to find time to prepare them for publication. His colleagues edited and published some of his remaining works on the Bible after his death: prayers on the Psalms (1564) and commentaries on Kings (1566), Genesis (1569), and Lamentations (1629). Vermigli followed the humanist emphasis on seeking the original meaning of scripture, as opposed to the often fanciful and arbitrary allegorical readings of the medieval exegetical tradition. He occasionally adopted an allegorical reading to interpret the Old Testament as having to do with Christ typologically, but he did not utilise the &quot;quadriga&quot; method of medieval biblical interpretation, where each passage has four levels of meaning. Vermigli&#x27;s command of Hebrew, as well as his knowledge of rabbinic literature, surpassed that of most of his contemporaries, including Calvin, Luther, and Zwingli.

Vermigli published an account of his disputation with Oxford Catholics over the Eucharist in 1549, along with a treatise further explaining his position. The disputation largely dealt with the doctrine of transubstantiation, which Vermigli strongly opposed, but the treatise was able to put forward Vermigli&#x27;s own Eucharistic theology. Vermigli&#x27;s Eucharistic views, as expressed in the disputation and treatise, were influential in the changes to the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of 1552. Vermigli weighed in again on the Eucharistic controversy in England in 1559. His &quot;Defense Against Gardiner&quot; was in reply to Stephen Gardiner&#x27;s 1552 and 1554 &quot;Confutatio Cavillationum&quot;, itself a reply to the late Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s work. At 821 folio pages, it was the longest work on the subject published during the Reformation period.

Vermigli&#x27;s Eucharistic polemical writing was initially directed against Catholics, but beginning in 1557 he began to involve himself in debates with Lutherans. Many Lutherans during this time argued that Christ&#x27;s body and blood were physically present in the Eucharist because they are ubiquitous, or everywhere. In 1561, Johannes Brenz published a work defending such a view, and Vermigli&#x27;s friends convinced him to write a response. The result, the &quot;Dialogue on the Two Natures in Christ&quot;, was written in the form of a dialogue between Orothetes (&quot;Boundary Setter&quot;), a defender of the Reformed doctrine that Christ&#x27;s body is physically located in Heaven, and Pantachus (&quot;Everywhere&quot;), whose speeches are largely taken directly from Brenz&#x27;s work. Brenz published a response in 1562, to which Vermigli began to prepare a rebuttal, but he died before he was able to complete it.

==Theology==
Vermigli was primarily a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This can be explained by the close relationship he saw between the exegesis of scripture and theological reflection. Vermigli&#x27;s method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed scripture alone held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly referred to them. He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.
Vermigli is best known for his polemics against the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and for the Reformed doctrine of &quot;sacramental presence&quot;. He argued that transubstantiation, the belief that the substance of bread and wine are changed into Christ&#x27;s body and blood, was not based on any argument from scripture. He also argued on the basis of Chalcedonian Christology, that because Christ retained his divine nature when he became man (the divine nature was added to the human nature rather than his human nature being made divine), the substance of the bread and wine remain the same rather than being changed into the substance of Christ&#x27;s body and blood. Finally, he used the analogy of the believer&#x27;s union with Christ against the idea of transubstantiation. Because believers retain their human nature even though God has joined them with Christ, it follows that the Eucharistic elements do not need to be transformed to be Christ&#x27;s body. Instead of the substance of the elements changing into Christ&#x27;s flesh, Vermigli emphasised the action of the sacrament as an instrument through which Christ is offered to the partaker. He also disagreed with the Anabaptist belief that the Eucharist is simply symbolic or figurative, a view called memorialism or tropism.

Vermigli did not see predestination as central to his theological system, but it became associated with him because of controversies in which he became entangled. Vermigli developed his doctrine independently of John Calvin, and before Calvin published it in his 1559 &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;. Vermigli saw God as sovereign over every event, and believed that all things, including evil, were used by him to accomplish his will. Nevertheless, Vermigli did not hold that humans are compelled to good or evil actions. Vermigli held that God had chosen some people for salvation on the basis of grace or unmerited favour alone, with no consideration for any good or evil characteristics, a view referred to as &quot;unconditional election&quot;. Vermigli also believed that God passed over the reprobate, those who were not elected to salvation. He saw this as included in the will of God, but different in character from the decision to choose the elect for salvation. Because all people have fallen into sin, the reprobating will of God treats them as by nature fallen and deserving of damnation. Vermigli&#x27;s formulation of reprobation as within God&#x27;s decree while distinct from his saving election was slightly different from Calvin&#x27;s. Calvin saw predestination to salvation and reprobation as two sides of a single decree. Vermigli&#x27;s doctrine was to prove more influential in the Reformed confessions. In his early formulation of predestination (ca. 1543–1544), Vermigli drew heavily on Aquinas&#x27;s &quot;Summa theologiae&quot;.

Vermigli&#x27;s biblical writings frequently address political matters. He followed the Aristotelian view that political authority is instituted to promote virtue, and that this includes religion as the chief virtue. Vermigli defended the standard English Protestant doctrine of Royal Supremacy, that kings, so long as they obey God, have the right to rule the church in their land, while Christ is the only head of the universal church. He denied the idea that the pope or any other ecclesiastical authority could exercise authority over a civil ruler such as the king, an important issue at the time given the conflicts between Pope Clement VII and Henry VIII at the beginning of the English Reformation. While Vermigli charged the civil magistrate with enforcing religious duties, he followed Augustine&#x27;s distinction in the &quot;City of God&quot; between the spiritual sphere (in Vermigli&#x27;s words the &quot;inward motions of the mind&quot;) and the &quot;outward discipline&quot; of society. The civil magistrate&#x27;s authority is only on external matters rather than inward and spiritual religious devotion. Vermigli&#x27;s theological justification for Royal Supremacy was used by the framers of the 1559 Elizabethan Settlement, the imposition of Protestant worship based on the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; as the state religion.

==Legacy==
Vermigli&#x27;s leadership in Lucca left it arguably the most thoroughly Protestant city in Italy. The Inquisition led many of these Protestants to flee, creating a significant population of Protestant refugees in Geneva. Several important leaders in the Reformation can also be tied to Vermigli&#x27;s work in Lucca, including Girolamo Zanchi and Bernardino Ochino.

Scholars have increasingly recognised the importance of figures other than John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli in the early formation of the Reformed tradition. Richard Muller, a chief authority on the development of this movement, has argued that Vermigli, Wolfgang Musculus, and Heinrich Bullinger were as influential if not more influential than Calvin on the development of Reformed theology in the sixteenth century. Vermigli was a transitional figure between the Reformation period and the period known as Reformed orthodoxy. In the Reformed orthodox period, the theology first articulated by Reformation figures was codified and systematised. Theologians increasingly resorted to the methods of scholastic theology and the tradition of Aristotelianism. Vermigli was the first of the Reformed scholastic theologians, and he influenced later scholastics Theodore Beza and Girolamo Zanchi.

Vermigli had a profound influence on the English Reformation through his relationship with Thomas Cranmer. Before his contact with Vermigli, Cranmer held Lutheran Eucharistic views. Vermigli seems to have convinced Cranmer to adopt a Reformed view, which changed the course of the English Reformation since Cranmer was primarily responsible for revisions to the Book of Common Prayer and writing the Forty-two Articles. Vermigli had a direct role in the modifications of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of 1552. He is also believed to have contributed to, if not written, the article on predestination found in the Forty-two Articles of Religion of 1553. In Elizabethan Oxford and Cambridge, Vermigli&#x27;s theology was arguably more influential than that of Calvin. His political theology in particular shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement and his authority was constantly invoked in the controversies of this period.

Various of Vermigli&#x27;s writings were printed about 110 times between 1550 and 1650. The 1562 &quot;Loci Communes&quot; became a standard textbook in Reformed theological education. He was popular especially with English readers of theology in the seventeenth century. John Milton probably consulted his commentary on Genesis when writing &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The English edition of the &quot;Loci Communes&quot; was brought to the Massachusetts Bay Colony where it was an important textbook at Harvard College. More of Vermigli&#x27;s works were found in the libraries of seventeenth-century Harvard divinity students than those of Calvin. Vermigli&#x27;s works were highly regarded by New England Puritan theologians such as John Cotton and Cotton Mather.

<text>National nature reserves in England were established by English Nature, now Natural England, which manages them either directly or through non-governmental organisations such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds or the National Trust.

There are 25 national nature reserves in Cumbria, including the large Moor House-Upper Teesdale reserve which is shared with County Durham.

All national nature reserves include all or part of a named Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Moor House-Upper Teesdale is also a Biosphere reserve.

==Types of habitat==
*Wetlands

A number of the reserves are bogs (often called &quot;moss&quot; in local dialect), a type of habit which the European Union is keen to protect. 
Bassenthwaite Lake, one of the largest lakes in the English Lake District, is a habitat for the Osprey.

*Limestone pavements
Whitbarrow and Park Wood are limestone habitats.
