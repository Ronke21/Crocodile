<text>Sword, commonly known as Sword Beach, was the code name given to one of the five main landing areas along the Normandy coast during the initial assault phase, Operation Neptune, of Operation Overlord. The Allied invasion of German-occupied France commenced on 6 June 1944. Stretching from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, the beach proved to be the easternmost landing site of the invasion after the abortion of an attack on a sixth beach, code-named Band. Taking Sword was to be the responsibility of the British Army with sea transport, mine sweeping and a naval bombardment force provided by the British Royal Navy as well as elements from the Polish, Norwegian and other Allied navies.

Among the five beaches of the operation, Sword is the nearest to Caen, about from the goal of the 3rd Infantry Division. The landings were achieved with low Allied casualties but the advance from the beach was slowed by traffic congestion and resistance in defended areas behind the beach. Further progress towards Caen was halted by the only armoured counter-attack of the day, mounted by the 21st Panzer Division.

==Background==
Following the Fall of France, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to return to continental Europe and liberate the Nazi German-occupied nations. The Western Allies agreed to open a Second Front in northern Europe in 1942 to aid the Soviet Union. However, with resources for an invasion lacking, it was postponed but planning was undertaken that in the event of the German position in western Europe becoming critically weakened or the Soviet Union&#x27;s situation becoming dire, forces could be landed in France; Operation Sledgehammer. At the same time, planning was underway for a major landing in occupied France during 1943; Operation Roundup. In August 1942, Canadian and British forces attempted an abortive landing—Operation Jubilee—at the Calais port-town of Dieppe; the landing was designed to test the feasibility of a cross-channel invasion. The attack was poorly planned and ended in disaster; 4,963 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. The decision to prosecute the Battle of the Atlantic to its closure, the lack of landing craft, invading Sicily in July 1943, and Italy in September following the defeat of Axis forces in North Africa in May 1943 resulted in the postponement of any assault on northern Europe till 1944.

Having succeeded in opening up an offensive front in southern Europe, gaining valuable experience in amphibious assaults and inland fighting, Allied planners returned to the plans to invade Northern France. Now scheduled for 5 June 1944, the beaches of Normandy were selected as landing sites, with a zone of operations extending from the Cotentin Peninsula to Caen. Operation Overlord called for the British Second Army to assault between the River Orne and Port en Bessin, capture the German-occupied city of Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé to the south-east of Caen, in order to acquire airfields and protect the left flank of the United States First Army while it captured Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the city of Falaise, which could then be used as a pivot for an advance on Argentan, the Touques River and then towards the Seine River. Overlord would constitute the largest amphibious operation in military history. After delays, due to both logistical difficulties and poor weather, the D-Day of Overlord was moved to 6 June 1944. Eisenhower and Bernard Montgomery, commander of 21st Army Group, aimed to capture Caen within the first day, and liberate Paris within 90 days.

==Plans==
===Allied===
The coastline of Normandy was divided into seventeen sectors, with codenames using a spelling alphabet—from Able, west of Omaha, to Roger on the east flank of Sword. Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include Utah on the Cotentin Peninsula. Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and White.

The Anglo-Canadian assault landings on D-Day were to be carried out by the British Second Army, under Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey. The Second Army&#x27;s I Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General John Crocker, was assigned to take Sword. To Major General Tom Rennie&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division fell the task of assaulting the beaches and seizing the main British objective on D-Day, the historic Norman city of Caen. Attached to the 3rd Infantry Division for the assault were the 27th Independent Armoured Brigade, the 1st Special Service Brigade (which also contained Free French Commandos), No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando of the 4th Special Service Brigade, Royal Marine armoured support, additional artillery and engineers, and elements of the 79th Armoured Division. 6th Beach Group was deployed to assist the troops and landing craft landing on Sword and to develop the beach maintenance area.

The 3rd Infantry Division was ordered to advance on Caen, from Sword, with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division advancing on its western flank to secure Carpiquet airfield, from Juno Beach, on the outskirts of the city. The 3rd Infantry was also ordered to relieve the elements of the 6th Airborne Division that had secured the bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal during Operation Tonga, secure the high ground north of Caen, and &quot;if possible Caen itself&quot;. The last point was further reinforced when I Corps&#x27; commander, General Crocker, instructed the division, prior to the invasion, that by nightfall the city must be either captured or &quot;effectively masked&quot; with troops based north-west of the city and Bénouville.

Sword stretched about from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer in the west to the mouth of the River Orne in the east. It was further sub-divided into four landing sectors; from west to east these sectors were &#x27;Oboe&#x27; (from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer to Luc-sur-Mer), &#x27;Peter&#x27; (from Luc-sur-Mer to Lion-sur-Mer), &#x27;Queen&#x27; (from Lion-sur-Mer to La Brèche d&#x27;Hermanville), and finally &#x27;Roger&#x27; (from La Brèche d&#x27;Hermanville to Ouistreham). Each sector was also divided into multiple beaches. The sector chosen for the assault was the wide &#x27;White&#x27; and &#x27;Red&#x27; beaches of &#x27;Queen&#x27; sector, as shallow reefs blocked access to the other sectors. Two infantry battalions supported by DD tanks would lead the assault followed up by the commandos and the rest of the division; the landing was due to start at 07:25 hours.

===German===
On 23 March 1942, Führer Directive Number 40 called for the official creation of the Atlantic Wall—a line of concrete gun emplacements, machine-gun nests, minefields and beach obstacles stretching along the French coast. Fortifications were initially concentrated around ports, but were extended into other areas beginning in late 1943. While the German Army had seen its strength and morale heavily depleted by campaigns in Russia, North Africa and Italy, it remained a powerful fighting force. Most of the German divisions along the French coast in late 1943, however, were either formations of new recruits or battered veteran units still resting and rebuilding after service on the Eastern Front; altogether some 856,000 soldiers were stationed in France, predominantly along the Channel coast. They were supported by an additional 60,000 &quot;Hilfswillige&quot; (Russian and Polish conscripts to the German army).

Under the command of Field Marshals Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt, the defences of the Atlantic Wall were heavily upgraded; in the first six months of 1944, 1.2 million tons of steel and 17.3 million cubic yards of concrete were laid. The coast of northern France was also studded with four million antitank and anti-personnel mines, and 500,000 beach obstacles.

On and behind Sword, twenty strongpoints, including several artillery batteries, were constructed. The coastline was littered with wooden stakes, mines, hedgehogs, and Dragon&#x27;s teeth, while along the top of the beach, the Germans had constructed a network of trenches, gun pits, mortar pits, and machine gun nests. Barbed wire surrounded these positions and lined the beach. The beachfront itself, being generally flat and exposed, was guarded by a few scattered bunkers, with machine gun and sniper posts in some of the holiday homes and tourist facilities lining the shore. To reinforce the defences, six strongpoints had been constructed, each with at least eight 5 cm Pak 38 50 mm anti-tank guns, four 75 mm guns, and one 88 mm gun. One of the strongpoints (codenamed &quot;Cod&quot; by the British), faced directly on to Queen sector. Exits from the beaches had been blocked with various obstacles, and behind the beaches, six artillery batteries had been positioned, three of which were based within three strongpoints; these latter batteries had four 100 mm guns and up to ten 155mm guns. In addition, positioned east of the River Orne was the Merville Gun Battery, containing four Czechoslovakian 100 mm howitzers which were within range of Sword and the invasion fleet. Between Cherbourg and the River Seine there were a total of 32 batteries capable of firing on to the five invasion beaches; half of them were positioned in casemates of reinforced concrete.

Since the spring of 1942, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Wilhelm Richter&#x27;s 8,000-man strong 716th Infantry Division had been positioned to defend the Calvados coast of Normandy. In March 1942, the 352nd Infantry Division assumed control of the western Calvados coast, leaving the 716th in position north of Caen covering an 8-mile (13 km) stretch of coastline. The division comprised four regular infantry battalions, two Ost battalions, and artillery units. Four infantry companies were spread along Sword, with two positioned facing Queen sector—another four were positioned inland behind the beach. Further inland, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot;&#x27;s Edgar Feuchtinger&#x27;s 16,297 strong 21st Panzer Division had been positioned on both sides of the River Orne around Caen to provide an immediate counter-attack force should a landing take place. In May 1944, two &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; battalions and an antitank battalion from the 21st Panzer Division were placed under Richter&#x27;s command; this deployment eliminated 21st Panzer as a mobile reserve. One of these battalions, along with the division&#x27;s anti-tank guns and several mobile 155 mm guns, was positioned on Périers Ridge, which rose to about above sea level, south of Sword.

==D-Day at Sword==
===British assault===
The assault on Sword began at about 03:00 with the aerial and naval bombardment of German coastal defences and artillery sites. The landing was to be concentrated on Queen Red and Queen White in front of Hermanville-sur-Mer, other approaches having proven impassable due to shoals. At 07:25, the first units set off for the beach. These were the amphibious DD tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars; they were followed closely by the 8th Infantry Brigade, and by Royal Engineers in AVREs and the various odd-looking, specialized vehicles that had been nicknamed &#x27;Hobart&#x27;s funnies&#x27;. The engineers set to work clearing mines and obstacles under a steady hail of small arms fire and artillery fire from Périers Ridge just south of Hermanville. Resistance on the beach was initially fairly strong, with wrecked vehicles piling up and casualties mounting; however, with most of their armoured vehicles successfully landed, the British were able to quickly secure the immediate area. By 09:30 the engineers had cleared seven of the eight exits from the beach, allowing the inland advance to begin.

British and French commandos encountered tough resistance in the seaside town of Ouistreham, on Sword&#x27;s eastern extremity, but were able to clear it of enemy strongpoints. By 13:00, the 1st Special Service Brigade had reached the bridges on the River Orne and the Caen Canal, linking up with paratroops of the 6th Airborne Division, who were holding the bridges, after earlier disabling German gun batteries in a fierce night-time battle at Merville.

On the western flank of Sword, commandos of the 4th Special Service Brigade advanced to secure Lion-sur-Mer and meet Canadian forces at Juno Beach but encountered strong resistance and were pinned down by heavy fire for several hours. Around the main landing area, the men of the 3rd Infantry Division had secured Hermanville-sur-Mer by 10:00, but were finding tougher going as they slowly fought their way up Périers Ridge and moved inland. Congestion as more men, vehicles and equipment arrived on the beach further complicated matters. It was gradually becoming apparent that the British would not be able to meet the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, to protect the right flank in an immediate assault on Caen. Troops of the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry continued down the Hermanville-Caen road, reaching Biéville-Beuville, close to Caen, but were supported by only a few self-propelled guns, their flanks exposed. During the afternoon, the 21st Panzer Division, based around Caen, launched the only major German counterattack of D-Day.

===German counter-attacks===
The 21st Panzer Division, with its formidable inventory of some 127 Panzer IV tanks, was intended for use as a rapid response force. However, on the morning of June 6, its commander &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Edgar Feuchtinger was in Paris, and Rommel was in Germany. The division was unable to finalize orders and preparations for a counterattack until late in the day. At about 17:00, two thrusts were launched, east and west of the River Orne. The eastern attack, carried out by II Battalion and supporting units, under Major Hans von Luck, was intended to destroy the 6th Airborne Division&#x27;s Orne bridgehead but was soon stopped in its tracks by intense Allied air attacks and naval gunfire. To the west, a larger armoured group initially fared somewhat better. Taking advantage of the gap between the Sword and Juno sectors, elements of the 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment were able to reach the coast at Lion-sur-Mer by 20:00. With few flak units and very little support from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, they too suffered losses to Allied aircraft. When 250 gliders of the British 6th Airlanding Brigade overflew their positions, on their way to reinforce the Orne bridgehead in Operation Mallard, the Germans, believing they were about to be cut off, retired.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was particularly weak in this sector but tried to support the attack with a few of the rare daylight appearances it made on D-Day. &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Hugo Sperrle, commanding &quot;Luftflotte 3&quot; (Air Fleet 3) was responsible for the air defence of Normandy and ordered all available forces to attack the beachhead. Junkers Ju 88s from &quot;Kampfgeschwader 54&quot; (KG 54: Bomber Wing 54) attacked British positions with Butterfly Bombs. III./KG 54 struck Lion-sur-Mer while I./KG 54 bombed shipping at the mouth of the Orne. 145 Wing intercepted and shot down five German aircraft.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
By the end of D-Day, 28,845 men of I Corps had come ashore across Sword. The British Official Historian, L. F. Ellis, wrote that &quot;in spite of the Atlantic Wall over 156,000 men had been landed in France on the first day of the campaign.&quot; British losses in the Sword area amounted to 683 men. The British and Canadians were able to link up and resume the drive on Caen the following day, but three days into the invasion, the advance was halted. On 7 June, Operation Perch, a pincer attack by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and XXX Corps was launched to encircle Caen from the east and west flanks. The 21st Panzer Division halted the 51st Division advance and the XXX Corps attack resulted in the Battle of Villers-Bocage and the withdrawal of the leading elements of the 7th Armoured Division soon after. The next offensive, codenamed Operation Epsom, was launched by VIII Corps on 26 June, to envelope Caen from the west. German forces managed to contain the offensive but to do so, they were obliged to commit all their available strength.

On 27 June, the 3rd Infantry Division and its supporting tanks launched Operation &quot;Mitten&quot;. The objective was to seize two German-occupied châteaux, la Londe and le Landel. The initial evening assault was repulsed but the following morning, attacks gained the objectives and destroyed several German tanks. Operation &quot;Mitten&quot; cost at least three British tanks and 268 men. In 2003 Copp wrote that fighting for these châteaux made the area the &quot;bloodiest square mile in Normandy&quot;. Norman Scarfe wrote in 1947 that, had the operation gone more smoothly, further elements of the division and elements of the 3rd Canadian Division would have launched Operation Aberlour, an ambitious plan to capture several villages north of Caen but the attack was cancelled by Lieutenant-General John Crocker. Several days later I Corps launched a new offensive, codenamed Operation Charnwood, to gain possession of Caen. In a frontal assault, the northern half of the city was captured, but German forces retained possession of the city south of the River Orne. The southern half of Caen was only captured 12 days later by Canadian infantry during Operation Atlantic.

<text>The Independent is a British online newspaper. It was established in 1986 as a national morning printed paper. Nicknamed the &quot;Indy&quot;, it began as a broadsheet and changed to tabloid format in 2003. The last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016, leaving only the online edition.

The daily edition was named National Newspaper of the Year at the 2004 British Press Awards. &quot;The Independent&quot; won the Brand of the Year Award in The Drum Awards for Online Media 2023.

==History==

===1980s===

Launched in 1986, the first issue of &quot;The Independent&quot; was published on 7 October in broadsheet format. It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by Andreas Whittam Smith, Stephen Glover and Matthew Symonds. All three partners were former journalists at &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; who had left the paper towards the end of Lord Hartwell&#x27;s ownership. Marcus Sieff was the first chairman of Newspaper Publishing, and Whittam Smith took control of the paper.

The paper was created at a time of a fundamental change in British newspaper publishing. Rupert Murdoch was challenging long-accepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeated them in the Wapping dispute. Consequently, production costs could be reduced which created openings for more competition. As a result of controversy around Murdoch&#x27;s move to Wapping, the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside. &quot;The Independent&quot; attracted some of the staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his company&#x27;s new headquarters. Launched with the advertising slogan &quot;It is. Are you?&quot;, and challenging both &quot;The Guardian&quot; for centre-left readers and &quot;The Times&quot; as the newspaper of record, &quot;The Independent&quot; reached a circulation of more than 400,000 by 1989. 

Competing in a moribund market, &quot;The Independent&quot; sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as, within a few years, a price war in the market sector.

===1990s===
When &quot;The Independent&quot; launched &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; in 1990, sales were less than anticipated, partly due to the launch of the &quot;Sunday Correspondent&quot; four months prior, although this direct rival closed at the end of November 1990. Some aspects of production merged with the main paper, although the Sunday paper retained a largely distinct editorial staff.

In the 1990s, &quot;The Independent&quot; was faced with price cutting by the Murdoch titles, and started an advertising campaign accusing &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of reflecting the views of their proprietors, Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black. It featured spoofs of the other papers&#x27; mastheads with the words &quot;The Rupert Murdoch&quot; or &quot;The Conrad Black&quot;, with &quot;The Independent&quot; below the main title.

 had financial problems. A number of other media companies were interested in the paper. Tony O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s media group and Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) had bought a stake of about a third each by mid-1994. In March 1995, Newspaper Publishing was restructured with a rights issue, splitting the shareholding into O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Independent News &amp; Media (43%), MGN (43%), and Prisa (publisher of ) (12%).

In April 1996, there was another refinancing, and in March 1998, O&#x27;Reilly bought the other shares of the company for £30 million, and assumed the company&#x27;s debt. Brendan Hopkins headed Independent News, Andrew Marr was appointed editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;, and Rosie Boycott became editor of &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;. Marr introduced a dramatic if short-lived redesign which won critical favor but was a commercial failure, partly as a result of a limited promotional budget. Marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book, &quot;My Trade&quot;.

Boycott left in April 1998 to join the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, and Marr left in May 1998, later becoming the BBC&#x27;s political editor. Simon Kelner was appointed as the editor. By this time, the circulation had fallen below 200,000. Independent News spent heavily to increase circulation, and the paper went through several redesigns. While circulation increased, it did not approach the level which had been achieved in 1989, or restore profitability. Job cuts and financial controls reduced the morale of journalists and the quality of the product.

===2000s===
Ivan Fallon, on the board since 1995 and formerly a key figure at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, replaced Hopkins as head of Independent News &amp; Media in July 2002. By mid-2004, the newspaper was losing £5 million per year. A gradual improvement meant that by 2006, circulation was at a nine-year high.

In November 2008, following further staff cuts, production was moved to Northcliffe House, in Kensington High Street, the headquarters of Associated Newspapers. The two newspaper groups&#x27; editorial, management and commercial operations remained separate, but they shared services including security, information technology, switchboard and payroll.

===2010s===
On 25 March 2010, Independent News &amp; Media sold the newspaper to a new company owned by the family of Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev for a nominal £1 fee and £9.25 million over the next 10 months, choosing this option over closing &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, which would have cost £28 million and £40 million respectively, due to long-term contracts. Alexander&#x27;s son Evgeny became chairman of the new company, with Alexander becoming a board director. In 2009, Lebedev had bought a controlling stake in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;. Two weeks later, editor Roger Alton resigned.

In July 2011, &quot;The Independent&quot;″s columnist Johann Hari was stripped of the Orwell Prize he had won in 2008 after claims, to which Hari later admitted, of plagiarism and inaccuracy. In January 2012, Chris Blackhurst, editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;, told the Leveson inquiry that the scandal had &quot;severely damaged&quot; the newspaper&#x27;s reputation. He nevertheless told the inquiry that Hari would return as a columnist in &quot;four to five weeks&quot;. Hari later announced that he would not return to &quot;The Independent&quot;. Jonathan Foreman contrasted &quot;The Independent&quot;″s reaction to the scandal unfavorably with the reaction of American newspapers to similar incidents such as the Jayson Blair case, which led to resignations of editors, &quot;deep soul-searching&quot;, and &quot;new standards of exactitude being imposed&quot;. The historian Guy Walters suggested that Hari&#x27;s fabrications had been an open secret among the newspaper&#x27;s staff and that their internal inquiry was a &quot;facesaving exercise&quot;.

&quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; endorsed &quot;Remain&quot; in the Brexit referendum of 2016.

In March 2016, &quot;The Independent&quot; closed its print edition to become a pure play digital media company. The last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016. &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; published its last edition on 20 March 2016 and was closed.

In 2017, Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel bought a 30% stake in &quot;The Independent&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
Geordie Greig was appointed &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Editor-in-Chief in January 2023. He oversaw a period of editorial investment.

Later that year, Chief Executive of IDNML Zach Leonard moved to the United States as Global COO and President (North America), and former Editor Christian Broughton was appointed Chief Executive. Louise Thomas was appointed US Editor in March 2024.

==== Foreign language editions ====
In 2019, &quot;The Independent&quot; entered a long-term partnership with the Saudi Research &amp; Media Group, who operate under license the &quot;Independent Arabia&quot;, &quot;Independent Turkish&quot;, &quot;Independent Persian&quot; and &quot;Independent Urdu&quot; language editions. In September 2020, &quot;The Independent&quot; launched &quot;Independent en Español&quot;, a wholly owned and operated Spanish language edition.

===Format and design===
&quot;The Independent&quot; began publishing as a broadsheet, in a series of celebrated designs. The final version was designed by Carroll, Dempsey and Thirkell following a commission by Nicholas Garland who, along with Alexander Chancellor, was unhappy with designs produced by Raymond Hawkey and Michael McGuiness – on seeing the proposed designs, Chancellor had said &quot;I thought we were joining a serious paper&quot;. The first edition was designed and implemented by Michael Crozier, who was Executive Editor, Design and Picture, from pre-launch in 1986 to 1994.

From September 2003, the paper was produced in both broadsheet and tabloid-sized versions, with the same content in each. The tabloid edition was termed &quot;compact&quot; to distance itself from the more sensationalist reporting style usually associated with &quot;tabloid&quot; newspapers in the UK, preferring to remain focused on hard news (similarly to the tabloid-size edition of &quot;The Times.&quot;) After launching in the London area and then in North West England, the smaller format appeared gradually throughout the UK. Soon afterwards, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;Times&quot; followed suit, introducing its own tabloid-sized version. Prior to these changes, &quot;The Independent&quot; had a daily circulation of around 217,500, the lowest of any major national British daily, a figure that climbed by 15% as of March 2004 (to 250,000). Throughout much of 2006, circulation stagnated at a quarter of a million. On 14 May 2004, &quot;The Independent&quot; produced its last weekday broadsheet, having stopped producing a Saturday broadsheet edition in January. &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; published its last simultaneous broadsheet on 9 October 2005, and thereafter followed a compact design until the print edition was discontinued.

On 12 April 2005, &quot;The Independent&quot; redesigned its layout to a more European feel, similar to France&#x27;s &quot;Libération&quot;. The redesign was carried out by a Barcelona-based design studio. The weekday second section was subsumed within the main paper, double-page feature articles became common in the main news sections, and there were revisions to the front and back covers. A new second section, &quot;Extra&quot;, was introduced on 25 April 2006. It is similar to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;G2&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;″s &quot;Times2&quot;, containing features, reportage and games, including sudoku. In June 2007, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business, and a magazine focusing on life and culture. On 23 September 2008, the main newspaper became full-color, and &quot;Extra&quot; was replaced by an &quot;Independent Life Supplement&quot; focusing on different themes each day.

Three weeks after the acquisition of the paper by Alexander Lebedev and Evgeny Lebedev in 2010, the paper was relaunched with another redesign on 20 April. The new format featured smaller headlines and a new pullout &quot;Viewspaper&quot; section, which contained the paper&#x27;s comment and feature articles.

===Front pages===
Following the 2003 switch in format, &quot;The Independent&quot; became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages, which frequently relied on images, graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content. For example, following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005, it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund, and following the publication of the Hutton Report into the death of British government scientist David Kelly, its front page simply carried the word &quot;Whitewash?&quot; In 2003, the paper&#x27;s editor, Simon Kelner, was named &quot;Editor of the Year&quot; at the &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; awards, partly in recognition of, according to the judges, his &quot;often arresting and imaginative front-page designs&quot;. In 2008, as he was stepping down as editor, he stated that it was possible to &quot;overdo the formula&quot; and that the style of the paper&#x27;s front pages perhaps needed &quot;reinvention&quot;.

Under the subsequent editorship of Chris Blackhurst, the campaigning, poster-style front pages were scaled back in favor of more conventional news stories.

===Sections===
The weekday, Saturday and Sunday editions of &quot;The Independent&quot; all included supplements and pull-out subsections:

===Online presence===
&quot;The Independent&quot;″s original website launched in 1996.

On 23 January 2008, &quot;The Independent&quot; relaunched its online edition. The relaunched site introduced a new look, better access to the blog service, priority on image and video content, and additional areas of the site including art, architecture, fashion, gadgets and health. The paper launched podcast programmes such as &quot;The Independent Music Radio Show&quot;, &quot;The Independent Travel Guides&quot;, &quot;The Independent Sailing Podcasts&quot;, and &quot;The Independent Video Travel Guides&quot;.

From 2009, the website started carrying short video news bulletins provided by the Al Jazeera English news channel. Over the years this developed to the point that the website regularly featured video content in its news reports. Some of this was syndicated and sourced from other news channels and providers, but &quot;The Independent&quot; gradually increased numbers in its own video team. In addition to putting together short-form video news reports, the website soon began producing its own video and podcast series, including explainers, short documentary ‘on the ground&#x27; style reports, and lifestyle and culture videos, including since 2017 the award-nominated series Millennial Love, later rebranded Love Lives.

In 2014, &quot;The Independent&quot; launched a sister website, &quot;i100&quot;, a &quot;shareable&quot; journalism site with similarities to Reddit and Upworthy. It was rebranded in 2016 as Indy100.

In late 2020 &quot;The Independent&quot; launched Independent TV, which saw the title&#x27;s video offering provided on many formats including on the web browser, in the app, and on Smart TV.

In March 2023 &quot;The Independent&quot; released &quot;The Body in the Woods&quot;, a feature-length documentary by its Chief International Correspondent, Bel Trew.

==Political views==
&quot;The Independent&quot; is generally described as centrist, centre-left, liberal, and liberal-left. When the paper was established in 1986, the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the British political spectrum and thought that it would attract readers primarily from &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. It has been seen as leaning to the left-wing of the political spectrum, making it more a competitor to &quot;The Guardian&quot;; however, &quot;The Independent&quot; tends to take a liberal, pro-market stance on economic issues. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; referred to itself as a &quot;proudly liberal newspaper&quot;.

The paper has highlighted what it refers to as war crimes being committed by pro-government forces in the Darfur region of Sudan.

The paper has been a strong supporter of electoral reform. In 1997, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; launched a campaign for the decriminalisation of cannabis. Ten years later, it reversed itself, arguing that skunk, the cannabis strain &quot;smoked by the majority of young Britons&quot; in 2007, had become &quot;25 times stronger than resin sold a decade ago&quot;.

The paper&#x27;s opinion on the British monarchy has sometimes been described as republican, though it officially identifies as reformist, wishing for a reformed monarchy that &quot;reflects the nation over which it reigns and which is accountable to the people for its activities&quot;. Originally, it avoided royal stories, Whittam Smith later saying he thought the British press was &quot;unduly besotted&quot; with the Royal Family and that a newspaper could &quot;manage without&quot; stories about the monarchy.

In 2007, Alan Rusbridger, editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said of &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;The emphasis on views, not news, means that the reporting is rather thin, and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that&quot;. In a 12 June 2007 speech, British Prime Minister Tony Blair called &quot;The Independent&quot; a &quot;viewspaper&quot;, saying it &quot;was started as an antidote to the idea of journalism as views not news. That was why it was called the Independent. Today it is avowedly a viewspaper not merely a newspaper&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; criticised Blair&#x27;s comments the following day; it later changed format to include a &quot;Viewspaper&quot; insert in the centre of the regular newspaper, designed to feature most of the opinion columns and arts reviews.

A leader published on the day of the 2008 London mayoral election compared the candidates and said that, if the newspaper had a vote, it would vote first for the Green Party candidate, Siân Berry, noting the similarity between her priorities and those of &quot;The Independent&quot;, and secondly, with &quot;rather heavy heart&quot;, for the incumbent, Ken Livingstone.

An Ipsos MORI poll estimated that in the 2010 United Kingdom general election, 44% of regular readers voted Liberal Democrat, 32% voted Labour, and 14% voted Conservative, compared to 23%, 29%, and 36%, respectively, of the overall electorate. On the eve of the 2010 general election, &quot;The Independent&quot; supported the Liberal Democrats, arguing that &quot;they are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties, sound economics, international co-operation on the great global challenges and, of course, fundamental electoral reform. These are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear.&quot; However, before the 2015 United Kingdom general election, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; desisted from advising its readers how to vote, writing that &quot;this does not mean that we are a bloodless, value-free news-sheet. We have always been committed to social justice&quot;, but the paper recognised that it was up the readers to &quot;make up [their] own mind about whether you agree with us or not&quot;. Rather than support a particular party, the paper urged all its reader to vote as &quot;a responsibility of common citizenship&quot;. On 4 May 2015, the weekday version of &quot;The Independent&quot; said that a continuation of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition after the general election would be a positive outcome.

At the end of July 2018, &quot;The Independent&quot; led a campaign they called the &quot;Final Say&quot;, a change.org petition by former editor Christian Broughton, for a binding referendum on the Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.

As of October 2018, &quot;Independent Arabia&quot; was launched. It is published under license, and owned and managed by Saudi Research and Media Group (SRMG), a major publishing organization with close ties to the Saudi royal family.

In the 2024 United Kingdom general election, &quot;The Independent&quot; endorsed the Labour Party, although added what it termed as a warning that: “Labour must turn its promises into policies that benefit the hardworking and hopeful people of this country”.

===&quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;===
&quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; (&quot;IoS&quot;) was the Sunday sister newspaper of &quot;The Independent&quot;. It ceased to exist in 2016, the last edition being published on 20 March.

=== &quot;The i Paper&quot;===

In October 2010, the &quot;i&quot;, a compact sister newspaper, was launched. The &quot;i&quot; is a separate newspaper but uses some of the same material. It was later sold to regional newspaper company Johnston Press, becoming that publisher&#x27;s flagship national newspaper, before being sold again. It currently belongs to Daily Mail and General Trust. In 2024, the paper was rebranded as &quot;The i Paper&quot;.

===Indy100===
The online news site indy100 was announced by &quot;The Independent&quot; in February 2016, to be written by journalists but with stories selected by &#x27;upvotes&#x27; from readers.

===&quot;The (RED) Independent&quot;===
&quot;The Independent&quot; supported U2 lead singer Bono&#x27;s Product RED brand by creating &quot;The (RED) Independent&quot;, an occasional edition that gave half the day&#x27;s proceeds to the charity. The first edition was in May 2006. Edited by Bono, it drew high sales.

A September 2006 edition of &quot;The (RED) Independent&quot;, designed by fashion designer Giorgio Armani, drew controversy due to its cover shot, showing model Kate Moss in blackface for an article about AIDS in Africa.

=== The Pride List ===
The Pride List was initially labeled as The Pink List, published by the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; on 6 August 2000. It contained a list of the 48 most prominent LGBT people in the UK. This was resurrected as the Pride List in 2023 and 2024.

<doc id="103959" wikidata="Q485039" url="?curid=103959" title="Deftones">
<text>Deftones is an American alternative metal band formed in Sacramento, California in 1988. They were formed by frontman Chino Moreno, lead guitarist Stephen Carpenter and drummer Abe Cunningham, with bassist Chi Cheng and keyboardist and turntablist Frank Delgado joining the line-up in 1990 and 1999, respectively. The band&#x27;s experimental nature has led some critics to describe them as &quot;the Radiohead of metal&quot;.

After the line-up settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with Maverick Records, and subsequently released their debut album &quot;Adrenaline&quot; in 1995. Extensive touring and word-of-mouth promotion of the album helped Deftones garner a dedicated fan base. Their second album &quot;Around the Fur&quot; (1997), reached chart positions along with its singles, and became the band&#x27;s first to receive certification from the RIAA.

The band found even further success with their third album &quot;White Pony&quot; (2000), which marked a transition from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single &quot;Change (In the House of Flies)&quot; is the band&#x27;s most commercially successful single, and the track &quot;Elite&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance; it was also the band&#x27;s first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States. Their self-titled fourth album was released in 2003. While the group&#x27;s critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to &quot;White Pony&quot;. Deftones&#x27; fifth studio effort, &quot;Saturday Night Wrist&quot; (2006), received similar praise, although the album&#x27;s production was marred by creative tensions and personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material.

In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled &quot;Eros&quot;, Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of cardiac arrest. After Cheng&#x27;s accident, Deftones halted production on &quot;Eros&quot; and recruited Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega until his departure in early 2021. The band released the critically celebrated &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot; in 2010 and embarked on a triple-headline tour with Alice in Chains and Mastodon throughout North America. Their seventh and eighth albums, &quot;Koi No Yokan&quot; (2012) and &quot;Gore&quot; (2016) respectively, saw the band continue to move in an increasingly experimental direction and were released to critical acclaim. Their latest album, &quot;Ohms&quot; (2020), received significant critical praise for its return to the band&#x27;s heavier sound.

==History==
===Early years (1988–1993)===
When Stephen Carpenter was 15 years old, he was hit by a car while skateboarding. Confined to a wheelchair for several months, he began teaching himself to play guitar by playing along to songs by thrash metal bands such as Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death, and Metallica. A long-circulated myth alleged that the driver paid Carpenter a cash settlement that allowed the band to purchase equipment, but Abe Cunningham commented in a 2007 interview that the story about the settlement was false.

Carpenter, Cunningham and Chino Moreno were childhood friends. All three went to C. K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento and remained friends through the city&#x27;s skateboarding scene. Carpenter was a fan of heavy metal, and Moreno was interested in hardcore punk bands such as Bad Brains and post-punk and new wave bands such as Depeche Mode and the Cure. When Moreno found out that Carpenter played guitar, he set up a jam session with Cunningham, who played drums, and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter&#x27;s garage around 1988. They recruited bassist Dominic Garcia some time after, and the band became a four-piece. When Cunningham left Deftones to join Phallucy, another band from Sacramento, Garcia switched to drums. Chi Cheng joined to play bass, and the band recorded a four-track demo soon afterwards. John Taylor replaced Garcia on drums in 1991, until Cunningham&#x27;s return in 1993. Within two years, the band began playing club shows and later expanded their gigging territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles, where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn. While closing for another band in L.A., after the majority of the audience had left, the band impressed a Maverick Records representative. They were signed to the label after performing three of their songs for Freddy DeMann and Guy Oseary.

Carpenter created the band&#x27;s name by combining the hip hop slang term &quot;&quot; with the suffix &quot;-tones&quot;. The name is also a pun on the term &quot;tone deaf.&quot;

===&quot;Adrenaline&quot; (1994–1996)===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Adrenaline&quot;, was recorded at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington and released on October 3, 1995. It was produced by Deftones and Terry Date, who would go on to produce the band&#x27;s next three albums. While they were initially commercially unsuccessful, the band built a dedicated fan base through extensive touring, word-of-mouth and Internet promotion. Through their efforts, &quot;Adrenaline&quot; went on to sell over 220,000 copies. It is regarded as an important part of the 1990s nu metal movement. An early track which predated &quot;Adrenaline&quot; but did not make the album&#x27;s final cut was &quot;Teething&quot;; the band contributed the song to the soundtrack for the 1996 film &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot;. The band can also be seen performing the song live during The Day of The Dead festival scene as themselves.

The album spent 21 weeks on the &quot;Billboard Heatseekers&quot; chart, reaching a peak position of 23. When asked what he attributed the album&#x27;s success to, Cheng responded, &quot;One word: perseverance. We&#x27;ve been together for almost eight years, on the road for two, and we do it with honesty and integrity—and the kids can tell&quot;. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on July 7, 1999, and was certified platinum on September 23, 2008.

Regarding the recording of the album, Cunningham said, &quot;At the time we did the first record—which I really like and think is good—you can tell the band was really young. We&#x27;d been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn&#x27;t really think a whole lot about making the songs better&quot;. Moreno felt that &quot;Adrenaline&quot; was recorded &quot;really fast&quot; and performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone. AllMusic&#x27;s review of &quot;Adrenaline&quot; praised the album&#x27;s musical control, precision, overall groove and Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly sophisticated drumming&quot;. It was also noted that &quot;there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno&#x27;s whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit&quot;.

===&quot;Around the Fur&quot; (1997–1999)===
Deftones&#x27; second album, &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, was recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle, Washington and produced by Date. Released on October 28, 1997, the album was dedicated to Dana Wells, the late stepson of the singer Max Cavalera of Sepultura, Soulfly and Cavalera Conspiracy. Cavalera also collaborated on &quot;Headup&quot;, a tribute to Wells. Although not yet a member of the band, Delgado was credited as &quot;audio&quot; on five of the album&#x27;s tracks. Cunningham&#x27;s wife, Annalynn, provided guest vocals on &quot;MX&quot;.

&quot;When we went in to make this record, we really didn&#x27;t have a set idea of what we wanted to come out with&quot;, said Moreno in a 1998 interview with &quot;Chart&quot; magazine. However, he felt that the album &quot;fell into place&quot; once the band had settled into the studio. The band expanded its sound, spending more time with Date and giving more thought to the album&#x27;s production. Cunningham varied his drum sound and experimented by using different types of snare drum on almost every track. The album was praised for its loud-soft dynamics, the flow of the tracks, Moreno&#x27;s unusual vocals, and the strong rhythm-section performance of Cheng and Cunningham. Stephen Thomas Erlewine&#x27;s retrospective review noted that &quot;while they don&#x27;t have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, &quot;Around the Fur&quot; suggests they&#x27;re about to come into their own&quot;.

&quot;Around the Fur&quot; propelled the band to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength of radio and MTV airplay for the singles &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It)&quot; and &quot;Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)&quot;. &quot;Around the Fur&quot; sold 43,000 copies in its first week of release, and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 29 (its peak position), remaining on the charts for 17 weeks. The band went back to touring, making appearances at the Warped Tour (in the United States, New Zealand and Australia), Pinkpop Festival, Roskilde Festival and Ozzfest as well as releasing a live EP on June 22, 1999. &quot;Around the Fur&quot; went on to reach RIAA gold status on June 24, 1999, and platinum status on June 7, 2011. &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It)&quot; appeared on &quot;The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture&quot;, released March 30, 1999.

===&quot;White Pony&quot; (2000–2002)===

On June 20, 2000, the band released their third album, &quot;White Pony&quot;, again produced by Date and Deftones. It was recorded at the Record Plant studio in Sausalito, California, and at Larrabee Sound Studios, West Hollywood, California. The album debuted at No. 3 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; chart with sales of 178,000 copies. Delgado, now a full-time band member, added new elements to the band&#x27;s music. The melancholy &quot;Teenager&quot;, for example, was a departure in style and mood, a &quot;love song&quot;, according to Moreno. Programming duties were carried out by DJ Crook, a friend of Moreno (and bandmate in his side project Team Sleep). &quot;Passenger&quot; was a collaboration with singer Maynard James Keenan of Tool, and the refrain in &quot;Knife Prty&quot; featured vocals by Rodleen Getsic. Moreno also started contributing additional guitar work.

An interview with the band in &quot;Alternative Press&quot; described the recording process of &quot;White Pony&quot;. After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording it, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno said that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of &quot;Change (In the House of Flies)&quot; was the turning point where the band began working as a unit. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time. Cheng explained, &quot;We didn&#x27;t feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make.&quot; Moreno did not have an overall lyrical theme in mind, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics: &quot;I basically didn&#x27;t sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things&quot;.

Reviews were generally positive, commenting on Moreno&#x27;s increasing sophistication as a lyricist and the group&#x27;s experimentalism. Allmusic&#x27;s review said that &quot;Deftones went soft, but in an impressive way, to twist around its signature punk thrash sound&quot;.

The album was originally released as an 11-track edition beginning with &quot;Feiticeira&quot; and ending with &quot;Pink Maggit&quot;, and featuring gray cover art. A limited-edition print of 50,000 black-and-red jewel case versions of &quot;White Pony&quot; was released at the same time with a bonus twelfth track titled &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Republic&quot;. Later, the band released &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot;, a rap-influenced interpretation of &quot;Pink Maggit&quot;. The song was released as a single and included as the new opening track of a re-released &quot;White Pony&quot; on October 3, 2000. The new release still had &quot;Pink Maggit&quot; as the final track and featured altered white cover art. Not entirely happy with re-releasing the album, the band negotiated to have &quot;Back to School&quot; made available as a free download for anyone who had already bought the original album. Moreno noted that &quot;Everybody&#x27;s already downloaded our record before it came out anyway, otherwise I&#x27;d be kind of feelin&#x27; like, &#x27;Man, why [are] we putting [out] all these different versions of the record?&#x27; [...] that&#x27;s the best way we can actually get this song out to the people who already purchased this record, for free basically. And if they wanna buy the record again, it&#x27;s cool&quot;.

&quot;White Pony&quot; achieved platinum status on July 17, 2002, selling over 1.3 million copies in the US, and earning the band a 2001 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song &quot;Elite&quot;.

===&quot;Deftones&quot; (2002–2005)===

Deftones began work on their fourth album under the working title &quot;Lovers&quot;. Regarding the album&#x27;s direction, Cheng commented, &quot;We&#x27;ve proven that we can musically go in any direction we want, and we want to get kind of heavy on this one&quot;. Moreno underwent vocal training as a precaution after severely damaging his vocal cords on the band&#x27;s 2001 summer tour. The band converted their rehearsal space in Sacramento into a fully equipped studio and recorded most of the album there at negligible cost. The band brought in Date to assist with production and also received input on musical arrangement from Greg Wells on several of the album&#x27;s tracks. The band later added more material at Studio X in Seattle, Washington and at Larrabee Sound Studios. Overall, the album took 12 months and cost roughly $2.5 million to complete. The band was fined by Maverick for missing deadlines.

In January 2003, Deftones left the studio to perform several one-off shows in Australia and New Zealand as part of the annual Big Day Out festival. Shortly after, the band returned to the studio to finish their fourth album. The self-titled &quot;Deftones&quot; was released on May 20, 2003. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 2 and sold 167,000 copies in its first week. The album remained in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 for nine weeks, supported by the first single, &quot;Minerva&quot;. The band shot a video for the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Hexagram&quot;, with fans watching the band play the song in an indoor skatepark in Simi Valley, California.

Reviews were mainly positive, praising the band for the album&#x27;s progression and originality in the midst of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren&#x27;t going to be with them&quot;. In reviewing &quot;Deftones&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that &quot;Hexagram&quot;, the album&#x27;s opener, &quot;hits &quot;hard&quot;—harder than they ever have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is&quot;. He also went on to say, however, that the album &quot;sticks a little too close to familiar territory&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; similarly called the album &quot;less rewarding than its predecessor, though its peaks rival any in the genre&quot;.

The band released a compilation album titled &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot; on October 4, 2005. The CD includes various B-sides and covers from throughout their career, while the DVD contains behind-the-scenes footage and the band&#x27;s complete videography up to that point.

===&quot;Saturday Night Wrist&quot; (2006–2007)===


Rather than work with Date, their producer for many years, Deftones decided to record with Bob Ezrin on their fifth studio album. Cunningham said that while the group enjoyed working with Date, &quot;at this point, we just needed to change things up [...] And this is definitely a different style. Working with him [Ezrin] is just putting us fucking upside down. He&#x27;s cracking the whip&quot;. After recording all the instrumental parts for the record, Moreno decided to record his vocals separately, and finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. According to an interview with Abe Cunningham, there were tensions involved with the recording of &quot;Saturday Night Wrist&quot; that were related to the band members&#x27; personal lives. Cunningham compared the process to “pulling teeth.”

The band released the album, titled &quot;Saturday Night Wrist&quot;, on October 31, 2006. It debuted at No. 10 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; chart with sales of just over 76,000, a significant decrease in the first-week sales of their two previous releases. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hole in the Earth&quot;, was released on September 12, 2006. The single was featured in the video game &quot;Saints Row 2&quot; and as downloadable content for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of &quot;Guitar Hero 3&quot;. Blabbermouth.net wrote that Deftones &quot;have rallied to create one of the strongest discs in the band&#x27;s repertoire&quot;. &quot;Mein&quot; was the album&#x27;s second single, which was released on March 9, 2007. Collaborations on the record include Annie Hardy from Giant Drag on the song &quot;Pink Cellphone&quot; and Serj Tankian from System of a Down on the track &quot;Mein&quot;.

Deftones spent the majority of 2006 and 2007 touring around the world in support of the album, performing in North America, Europe, South America, Japan and Australia. The band also performed on such tours as Taste of Chaos, Family Values Tour and the Soundwave Festival.

===&quot;Eros&quot; sessions, Cheng&#x27;s car accident and Vega&#x27;s arrival (2008–2009)===
In the fall of 2007, Deftones started writing songs for what was planned to be their sixth studio album, &quot;Eros&quot;. Moreno described the album as unorthodox and aggressive. Recording started on April 14, 2008. The band returned to working with Terry Date as the producer for &quot;Eros&quot;.

On November 4, 2008, Cheng was seriously injured in a car accident in Santa Clara, California. As a result of the injuries sustained in the crash, he remained in a minimally conscious state. Following the accident, Cheng&#x27;s bandmates and his mother, Jeanne, began using the Deftones blog to post updates on Cheng&#x27;s condition. On December 9, 2008, it was announced that Cheng had been moved into the care of an unnamed hospital that &quot;specializes in the care and management of traumatic and non-trauma related brain injuries.&quot;

In late January 2009, the band released a new statement, stating that &quot;our fallen comrade has not yet made significant progress&quot;, and that a friend of the band, Sergio Vega (formerly of Quicksand), would be taking over as bassist in Cheng&#x27;s absence, as he had done temporarily in 1998. On April 5, the band played their first show without Cheng since 1998 at the Bamboozle Left festival in Irvine, California.

On June 23, 2009, Deftones announced on their official website that &quot;Eros&quot; would be delayed indefinitely, saying, &quot;As we neared completion on &quot;Eros&quot;, we realized that this record doesn&#x27;t best encompass and represent who we are currently as people and as musicians. And although those songs will see the light of day at some point, we collectively made the decision that we needed to take a new approach, and with Chi&#x27;s condition heavy on our minds while doing so. We needed to return to the studio to do what we felt was right artistically&quot;. They also said, &quot;The decision to hold off on releasing &quot;Eros&quot; has no connection with Chi&#x27;s condition or anything associated. This was, and is, purely a creative decision by the band to write, record, and deliver an amazing product&quot;.

Korn members Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch and Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu, along with members of Sevendust, Slipknot and other alternative metal bands, recorded and released &quot;A Song for Chi&quot;, with proceeds benefiting Cheng and his family. To aid in the fundraising for the Cheng family, the band announced two 2009 benefit shows in Los Angeles.

A website—One Love for Chi—was launched by Deftones fan Gina Blackmore on March 10, 2009, about four months after Cheng&#x27;s accident. The site served as a platform for updates and information on Cheng&#x27;s condition, as well as serving as an auction site for items donated by friends of the band. All proceeds raised by the website were donated to his family so they could provide him the best possible medical care.

===&quot;Diamond Eyes&quot; (2010–2011)===
Deftones&#x27; sixth album, &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot;, was originally scheduled for release on April 27, 2010; this date was later pushed back to May 18. In March, it was announced that the album had leaked onto the Internet, and the album&#x27;s release date was moved forward to May 4 as a result. On February 23, 2010, the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Rocket Skates&quot;, was made available for free download at www.gunsrazorsknives.com. The album was produced by Nick Raskulinecz. In contrast to &quot;Eros&quot;″ dark and aggressive nature, the band took a more optimistic approach both lyrically and sonically on &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot;.

On March 15, Deftones debuted their first radio-ready single, &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot;. Both &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot; and &quot;Rocket Skates&quot; received positive reviews from fans and critics, with many making comparisons of the two singles&#x27; style and sound to that of material from the &quot;Around the Fur&quot; album.

Teaming up with bands Mastodon and Alice in Chains, Deftones went on tour in the fall of 2010 in the United States and Canada. The tour was called Blackdiamondskye from the three bands&#x27; latest albums (&quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot;, &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot; and &quot;Crack the Skye&quot;). The tour included a limited edition series of silk-screened art prints promoting each show individually, created by the poster artist Jermaine Rogers. Rogers has created a majority of the Deftones concert poster and print artwork since the late 1990s.

On April 16, 2011, in honor of Record Store Day, the band released an LP titled &quot;Covers&quot;, containing several cover songs that the band had recorded over the years, including &quot;Drive&quot; (originally by the Cars), &quot;If Only Tonight We Could Sleep&quot; (originally by the Cure) and &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot; (originally by Sade). On October 25, Deftones released &quot;The Vinyl Collection 1995–2011&quot; in a limited edition of 1,000 copies.

=== &quot;Koi No Yokan&quot; and Cheng&#x27;s death (2012–2013) ===
On March 29, 2012, Carpenter revealed that the band were working on a new record in an interview posted on ESP Guitars&#x27;s YouTube channel. It was reported that Raskulinecz would return to produce their as-yet-unnamed seventh studio album.

It was also reported that the band would be recording several B-sides for the album, including an Elvis Presley cover and possibly an Earth, Wind, and Fire cover. It was later announced that there would be no bonus tracks. On July 28, Deftones performed a brand-new song titled &quot;Rosemary&quot; and also debuted another track titled &quot;Roller Derby&quot; (later retitled &quot;Poltergeist&quot;). &quot;Koi No Yokan&quot; was announced on August 30, 2012, and released on November 12, 2012, by Reprise Records. Metacritic rated &quot;Koi No Yokan&quot; 86 out of 100, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot; based on 18 reviews. In May 2013, it won &quot;Revolver&quot;″s Golden Gods Award for Album of the Year.

On April 13, 2013, despite making a partial recovery and returning home, Cheng died in a hospital in his hometown of Stockton, California, after falling into cardiac arrest. It had been more than four years since his 2008 accident. Moreno announced in May that the album &quot;Eros&quot;, shelved in 2008 after Cheng&#x27;s accident, was now more likely to be released following his death.

=== &quot;Gore&quot; (2014–2017) ===
In March 2014, while Moreno was touring with his side project Crosses in support of their self-titled debut album, the rest of Deftones began writing a follow-up to &quot;Koi No Yokan&quot;. Deftones also previously reported that they intended to record a new album either in late 2014 or early 2015.

On April 13, 2014, the first anniversary of Cheng&#x27;s death, Deftones released a track from &quot;Eros&quot; titled &quot;Smile&quot; on YouTube, the first officially released material from the long-shelved album. The video was removed by Warner Music Group two days later due to copyright infringement, despite the track having been uploaded by Moreno. Although the track has again been made available, it remains the only recording to be released from the &quot;Eros&quot; sessions to date.

In late February 2015, just after the band had finished the new album&#x27;s drum tracks, Moreno told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Deftones had written 16 songs during the album&#x27;s sessions. He described the album as &quot;a little more of a heady record&quot; than the previous album. On May 15, 2015, Moreno was interviewed by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; about the new album, which he described as having &quot;a lot of different moods&quot;. He further explained that it was not a &quot;happy record&quot;, but also &quot;not a completely angry record&quot;. Despite reports of Carpenter&#x27;s initial difficulty getting into the feel of the album, band members have noted the album&#x27;s distinct collaborative nature. Vega utilized a six-string bass when recording the new material, helping to push the band into new sonic territory. After producing their previous two records with Raskulinecz, Deftones worked with Matt Hyde, who had been a recording engineer on &quot;Koi No Yokan&quot;.

The album was pushed back multiple times from its originally scheduled September 2015 release date. On February 4, 2016, the band released the first single from &quot;Gore&quot;, titled &quot;Prayers / Triangles&quot;. &quot;Doomed User&quot; and &quot;Hearts / Wires&quot; were also made available ahead of the album&#x27;s release, on March 16 and April 3, respectively. &quot;Gore&quot; was officially released on April 8, 2016. The second official single, &quot;Phantom Bride&quot;, was released on June 7. The song featured a guitar solo by Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell; this is considered unusual for a Deftones song. Gwilym Mumford of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the album for its emphasis on experimentation and ambiance and noted the exploration work in the tension between the &quot;croon&quot; in Moreno&#x27;s &quot;soulful&quot; voice, his &quot;opaque&quot; lyrics, and Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;pile-driving&quot; guitar riffs.

=== &quot;Ohms&quot; and Vega&#x27;s departure (2017–2023) ===
In 2017, Chino Moreno revealed that Deftones had begun writing material for their ninth studio album, which he stated hoped would be out sometime in 2019. Moreno went on to state that the band would be going in a different direction than they had on &quot;Gore&quot; and that he would be taking a step back from leading the song writing to allow Stephen Carpenter and Abe Cunningham to be more involved in the material on the new album. In May 2018, Moreno was again asked about the new material and he stated the songs were &quot;considerably heavier&quot; than those on &quot;Gore&quot;. That same month, Deftones embarked on a South American tour with support from Quicksand and Deadly Apples.

In April 2020, Deftones announced that they were mixing their new album. During the recording sessions, which reportedly took place in Los Angeles, the band reunited with Terry Date as the producer of the album, making it the first time Deftones had worked with him since the unreleased &quot;Eros&quot; album in 2008. On August 19, 2020, the band teased the release date and the title of their upcoming ninth studio album. A day later, the band officially announced the title of the album, &quot;Ohms&quot;, set for release on September 25, 2020. At the same time, the band revealed the album itself, the album cover, the track list, and release date. The title track serves as the first single, and was released on August 21. On September 17, 2020, the band released the second single from the album, &quot;Genesis&quot;. On September 22, the band announced their &quot;Adopt-a-Dot&quot; campaign in which fans could digitally sponsor a dot from the &quot;Ohms&quot; album cover via a charitable donation.

In October 2020, they officially announced a 20th anniversary reissue of &quot;White Pony&quot; to be released in December of that year. The reissue was packaged alongside &quot;Black Stallion&quot;, a companion remix album featuring artists including Linkin Park&#x27;s Mike Shinoda, DJ Shadow and Robert Smith.

Deftones postponed their joint tour with Gojira in support of &quot;Ohms&quot; twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2022, it was announced that bassist Sergio Vega left the band in early 2021, with Vega claiming he was never an official member of the band and was just a contracted bassist for his tenure. Vega said he sought what he perceived as official membership, and chose to leave after being offered the same status as he had been since he began performing with the band. The following month, it was announced that Fred Sablan joined the band as Vega&#x27;s touring replacement. The band was also joined by touring guitarist Lance Jackman; on May 20, 2022, it was announced that Jackman would be temporarily replacing Carpenter during the band&#x27;s 2022 European Tour.

===Tenth studio album (2024–present)===

In April 2024, Chino Moreno told KROQ that the band had completed the bulk of its tenth studio album. He said the entire album was tracked instrumentally, but vocals had yet to be recorded.

In September 2024, Deftones announced a 2025 North American headlining tour, the band&#x27;s first headlining tour since 2022. On November 4, 2024, the band announced a headline show in Crystal Palace Park, London on June 29, 2025 with Weezer and High Vis.

==Musical style, influences and legacy==
Although initially rooted in metal, Deftones have always claimed diverse influences from groups of various genres, with their musical style diversifying over their career. Their sound has been described as alternative metal, art rock/art metal, experimental rock, shoegaze, nu metal, post-punk, , alternative rock, dream pop, drone rock, post-metal, post-rock, progressive metal, stoner rock, math metal, hard rock, trip hop, glitch, funk metal, and psychedelia.

Originally, the band was often associated with the nu metal movement in the press. However, Moreno has emphatically rejected the application of that label to the band. Asked about their connection with bands such as Korn, Moreno has also stated that their commonality came down to only the shared influence of Faith No More, especially the percussive approach to vocals by Mike Patton. Following the release of Deftones&#x27; third album, &quot;White Pony&quot;, they were acknowledged by many critics to have moved beyond that label, though some would continue to use the label on the effort anyway, and it continued in some degree up through &quot;Deftones&quot;. In a review of &quot;B-Sides and Rarities&quot;, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; dubbed the band &quot;perhaps the smartest members of the now moribund Nü-Metal genre&quot;.

Deftones&#x27; influences include Faith No More, Primus, Bad Brains, Meshuggah, Fear Factory, the Smiths, and Hum. Additionally, Moreno has cited Prince, the Cure, Duran Duran, DJ Shadow, Portishead, OMD, Depeche Mode, Thompson Twins, and the Human League, as personal influences.

The music critic Johnny Loftus wrote, &quot;Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement [...] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like D.C. hardcore and dream pop into their Northern California alt-metal&quot;. Peter Buckley, the author of &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot;, called the band &quot;one of the most primal, powerful, and experimental&quot; bands in the alternative metal scene.

Moreno&#x27;s lyrics were described by &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;suggesting emotions rather than announcing them&quot;. Moreno himself described his lyrics as ambiguous and sometimes impersonal, saying: &quot;I like to be ambiguous when writing to a certain extent, and throwing something so brash [as Chi&#x27;s accident] against that and playing with it. And also making it sound dimensional. Giving the feeling off that it is raw and it is emotional, but it&#x27;s not just connected with our personal story. It&#x27;s not merely about our career and our lives, it&#x27;s bigger than that. When I hear the music, I get inspired to paint the lyrical pictures you describe, but I&#x27;m not always talking about myself&quot;. The band&#x27;s legacy has been compared to alternative rock group Radiohead, with some dubbing Deftones &quot;The Radiohead of metal&quot;. A 2020 &quot;Billboard&quot; article noted the band&#x27;s outlasting of multiple rock trends and sustained success, along with their dedicated fan community; Moreno also attributed their longevity to their diverse musical influences.

The band have been cited as an influence by musicians including 7 Angels 7 Plagues, Architects, Boston Manor, Carbomb, Chvrches, Deafheaven, Circa Survive, Disembodied, Every Time I Die, Fightstar, Finch, Glassjaw, Higher Power, In This Moment, Iwrestledabearonce, Karnivool, Linkin Park, Loathe, Misery Signals, Nothing, Paramore, Poison the Well, Senses Fail, Skycamefalling, Slipknot, Spiritbox, Static Dress, Suicide Silence, Thornhill, Thursday, the Used, Vein.fm, Taproot, the Weeknd and Will Haven.

==Side projects==
Deftones members have worked on several side projects, with Moreno fronting Team Sleep, Crosses, the post-metal band Palms, and supergroup Saudade (the latter including members from hardcore punk bands Bad Brains and Cro-Mags and avant-jazz group Medeski Martin &amp; Wood). Carpenter works with cinematic electronic metal group Sol Invicto, which he founded with producer Richie Londres. Carpenter has also worked with the supergroup Kush, featuring members of Fear Factory and Cypress Hill. Delgado is a member of a DJ group called Decibel Devils, a collective which includes Matt D, DJ Julez, and DJ Crook of Team Sleep. In 2000, Cheng released an album composed of his own spoken word poetry called &quot;The Bamboo Parachute&quot;.

<text>General American English, known in linguistics simply as General American (abbreviated GA or GenAm), is the umbrella accent of American English spoken by a majority of Americans, encompassing a continuum rather than a single unified accent. It is often perceived by Americans themselves as lacking any distinctly regional, ethnic, or socioeconomic characteristics, though Americans with high education, or from the (North) Midland, Western New England, and Western regions of the country are the most likely to be perceived as using General American speech. The precise definition and usefulness of the term continue to be debated, and the scholars who use it today admittedly do so as a convenient basis for comparison rather than for exactness. Some scholars prefer other names, such as Standard American English.

Standard Canadian English accents may be considered to fall under General American, especially in opposition to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Received Pronunciation. Noted phonetician John C. Wells, for instance, claimed in 1982 that typical Canadian English accents align with General American in nearly every situation where British and American accents differ.

== Terminology ==
=== History and modern definition ===
The term &quot;General American&quot; was first disseminated by American English scholar George Philip Krapp, who in 1925 described it as an American type of speech that was &quot;Western&quot; but &quot;not local in character&quot;. In 1930, American linguist John Samuel Kenyon, who largely popularized the term, considered it equivalent to the speech of &quot;the North&quot; or &quot;Northern American&quot;, but, in 1934, &quot;Western and Midwestern&quot;. Now typically regarded as falling under the General American umbrella are the regional accents of the West, Western New England, and the North Midland (a band spanning central Ohio, central Indiana, central Illinois, northern Missouri, southern Iowa, and southeastern Nebraska), plus the accents of highly educated Americans nationwide. Arguably, all Canadian English accents west of Quebec are also General American, though Canadian vowel raising and certain other features may serve to distinguish such accents from U.S. ones. William Labov et al.&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Atlas of North American English&quot; put together a scattergram based on the formants of vowel sounds, finding the Midland U.S., Western Pennsylvania, Western U.S., and Canada to be closest to the center of the scattergram, and concluding that they had fewer marked dialectical features than other regional accents of North American English, such as New York City or the Southern U.S.

Regarded as having General American accents in the earlier 20th century, but not by the middle of the 20th century, are the Mid-Atlantic United States, the Inland Northern United States, and Western Pennsylvania. However, many younger speakers within the Inland North, Mid-Atlantic region, and many other areas appear to be retreating from their regional features towards a more General American accent. Accents that have never been labeled &quot;General American&quot;, even since the term&#x27;s popularization in the 1930s, are the regional accents (especially the &quot;r&quot;-dropping ones) of Eastern New England, New York City, and the American South. In 1982, British phonetician John C. Wells wrote that two-thirds of the American population spoke with a General American accent.

=== Disputed usage ===

English-language scholar William A. Kretzschmar Jr. explains in a 2004 article that the term &quot;General American&quot; came to refer to &quot;a presumed most common or &#x27;default&#x27; form of American English, especially to be distinguished from marked regional speech of New England or the South&quot; and referring especially to speech associated with the vaguely-defined &quot;Midwest&quot;, despite any historical or present evidence supporting this notion. Kretzschmar argues that a General American accent is simply the result of American speakers suppressing regional and social features that have become widely noticed and stigmatized.

Since calling one variety of American speech the &quot;general&quot; variety can imply privileging and prejudice, Kretzchmar instead promotes the term &quot;Standard American English&quot;, which he defines as a level of American English pronunciation &quot;employed by educated speakers in formal settings&quot;, while still being variable within the U.S. from place to place, and even from speaker to speaker. However, the term &quot;standard&quot; may also be interpreted as problematically implying a superior or &quot;best&quot; form of speech. The terms Standard North American English and General North American English, in an effort to incorporate Canadian speakers under the accent continuum, have also been suggested by sociolinguist Charles Boberg. Since the 2000s, Mainstream American English has also been occasionally used, particularly in scholarly articles that contrast it with African-American English.

Modern language scholars discredit the original notion of General American as a single unified accent, or a standardized form of English—except perhaps as used by television networks and other mass media. Today, the term is understood to refer to a continuum of American speech, with some slight internal variation, but otherwise characterized by the absence of &quot;marked&quot; pronunciation features: those perceived by Americans as strongly indicative of a fellow American speaker&#x27;s regional origin, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Despite confusion arising from the evolving definition and vagueness of the term &quot;General American&quot; and its consequent rejection by some linguists, the term persists mainly as a reference point to compare a baseline &quot;typical&quot; American English accent with other Englishes around the world (for instance, see Comparison of General American and Received Pronunciation).

== Origins ==
===Regional origins===
Though General American accents are not commonly perceived as associated with any region, their sound system does have traceable regional origins: specifically, the English of the non-coastal Northeastern United States in the very early 20th century, which was relatively stable since that region&#x27;s original settlement by English speakers in the mid-19th century. This includes western New England and the area to its immediate west, settled by members of the same dialect community: interior Pennsylvania, Upstate New York, and the adjacent &quot;Midwest&quot; or Great Lakes region. However, since the early to mid-20th century, deviance away from General American sounds started occurring, and may be ongoing, in the eastern Great Lakes region due to its Northern Cities Vowel Shift (NCVS) towards a unique Inland Northern accent (often now associated with the region&#x27;s urban centers, like Chicago and Detroit) and in the western Great Lakes region towards a unique North Central accent (often associated with Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota).

===Theories about prevalence===
Linguists have proposed multiple factors contributing to the popularity of a rhotic &quot;General American&quot; class of accents throughout the United States. Most factors focus on the first half of the twentieth century, though a basic General American pronunciation system may have existed even before the twentieth century, since most American English dialects have diverged very little from each other anyway, when compared to dialects of single languages in other countries where there has been more time for language change (such as the English dialects of England or German dialects of Germany).

One factor fueling General American&#x27;s popularity was the major demographic change of twentieth-century American society: increased suburbanization, leading to less mingling of different social classes and less density and diversity of linguistic interactions. As a result, wealthier and higher-educated Americans&#x27; communications became more restricted to their own demographic. This, alongside their new marketplace that transcended regional boundaries (arising from the century&#x27;s faster transportation methods), reinforced a widespread belief that highly educated Americans should not possess a regional accent. A General American sound, then, originated from both suburbanization and suppression of regional accent by highly educated Americans in formal settings. A second factor was a rise in immigration to the Great Lakes area (one native region of supposed &quot;General American&quot; speech) following the region&#x27;s rapid industrialization period after the American Civil War, when this region&#x27;s speakers went on to form a successful and highly mobile business elite, who traveled around the country in the mid-twentieth century, spreading the high status of their accents. A third factor is that various sociological (often race- and class-based) forces repelled socially-conscious Americans away from accents negatively associated with certain minority groups, such as African Americans and poor white communities in the South and with Southern and Eastern European immigrant groups (for example, Jewish communities) in the coastal Northeast. Instead, socially-conscious Americans settled upon accents more prestigiously associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant communities in the remainder of the country: namely, the West, the Midwest, and the non-coastal Northeast.

Kenyon, author of &quot;American Pronunciation&quot; (1924) and pronunciation editor for the second edition of &quot;Webster&#x27;s New International Dictionary&quot; (1934), was influential in codifying General American pronunciation standards in writing. He used as a basis his native Midwestern (specifically, northern Ohio) pronunciation. Kenyon&#x27;s home state of Ohio, however, far from being an area of &quot;non-regional&quot; accents, has emerged now as a crossroads for at least four distinct regional accents, according to late twentieth-century research. Furthermore, Kenyon himself was vocally opposed to the notion of any superior variety of American speech.

== In the media ==
General American, like the British Received Pronunciation (RP) and prestige accents of many other societies, has never been the accent of the entire nation, and, unlike RP, does not constitute a homogeneous national standard. Starting in the 1930s, nationwide radio networks adopted non-coastal Northern U.S. rhotic pronunciations for their &quot;General American&quot; standard. The entertainment industry similarly shifted from a non-rhotic standard to a rhotic one in the late 1940s, after the triumph of the Second World War, with the patriotic incentive for a more wide-ranging and unpretentious &quot;heartland variety&quot; in television and radio.

General American is thus sometimes associated with the speech of North American radio and television announcers, promoted as prestigious in their industry, where it is sometimes called &quot;Broadcast English&quot;, &quot;Network English&quot;, or &quot;Network Standard&quot;. Instructional classes in the United States that promise &quot;accent reduction&quot;, &quot;accent modification&quot;, or &quot;accent neutralization&quot; usually attempt to teach General American patterns. Television journalist Linda Ellerbee states that &quot;in television you are not supposed to sound like you&#x27;re &quot;from&quot; anywhere&quot;, and political comedian Stephen Colbert says he consciously avoided developing a Southern American accent in response to media portrayals of Southerners as stupid and uneducated.

== Phonology ==
Typical General American accent features (in contrast to, for example, British English) include features that concern consonants, such as rhoticity (full pronunciation of all sounds), pre-nasal T-glottalization (with &quot;satin&quot; pronounced , not ), T- and D-flapping (with &quot;metal&quot; and &quot;medal&quot; pronounced the same, as ), velarization of L in all contexts (with &quot;filling&quot; pronounced , not ), yod-dropping after alveolar consonants (with &quot;new&quot; pronounced , not ), as well as features that concern vowel sounds, such as various vowel mergers before (so that &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;marry&quot;, and &quot;merry&quot; are all commonly pronounced the same), raising of pre-voiceless (with &quot;price&quot; and &quot;bright&quot; using a higher and shorter vowel sound than &quot;prize&quot; and &quot;bride&quot;), raising and gliding of pre-nasal (with &quot;man&quot; having a higher and tenser vowel sound than &quot;map&quot;), the weak vowel merger (with &quot;affecting&quot; and &quot;effecting&quot; often pronounced the same), and at least one of the vowel mergers (the – merger is complete among most Americans and the – merger among at least half). All of these phenomena are explained in further detail under American English&#x27;s phonology section. The following provides all the General American consonant and vowel sounds.

=== Consonants ===
A table containing the consonant phonemes is given below:

*The phoneme is articulated variously as a retroflex approximant , a postalveolar approximant , and a velar bunched approximant , with various degrees of labialization and pharyngealization.

=== Vowels ===

* Vowel length is not phonemic in General American, and therefore vowels such as are customarily transcribed without the length mark. Phonetically, the vowels of GA are short when they precede the fortis consonants within the same syllable and long elsewhere. (Listen to the minimal pair of .) All unstressed vowels are also shorter than the stressed ones, and the more unstressed syllables follow a stressed one, the shorter it is, so that in &quot;lead&quot; is noticeably longer than in &quot;leadership&quot;. (See Stress and vowel reduction in English.)
* are considered to compose a natural class of tense monophthongs in General American, especially for speakers with the &quot;cot–caught&quot; merger. The class manifests in how GA speakers treat loanwords, as in the majority of cases stressed syllables of foreign words are assigned one of these six vowels, regardless of whether the original pronunciation has a tense or a lax vowel. An example of that is the common German name Hans, which is pronounced in GA with the tense rather than lax (as in Britain&#x27;s Received Pronunciation, which mirrors the German pronunciation with : also has a lax vowel). All of the tense vowels except and can have either monophthongal or diphthongal pronunciations (i.e. vs ). The diphthongs are the most usual realizations of and (as in &quot;stay&quot; and &quot;row&quot; , hereafter transcribed without the diacritics), which is reflected in the way they are transcribed. Monophthongal realizations are also possible, most commonly in unstressed syllables; here are audio examples for &quot;potato&quot; and &quot;window&quot; . In the case of and , the monophthongal pronunciations are in free variation with diphthongs. Even the diphthongal pronunciations themselves vary between the very narrow (i.e. ) and somewhat wider (i.e. ), with the former being more common. varies between back and central . As indicated in above phonetic transcriptions, is subject to the same variation (also when monophthongal: ), but its mean phonetic value is usually somewhat less central than in modern Received Pronunciation (RP).
* Raising of short &quot;a&quot; before nasals: For most speakers, the short &quot;a&quot; sound, as in or , is pronounced with the tongue raised, followed by a centering glide, whenever occurring before a nasal consonant (that is, before , and, for some speakers, ). This sound may be narrowly transcribed as (as in and ), or, based on a specific dialect, variously as or . See the chart for comparison to other dialects.

* Before dark in a syllable coda, and sometimes also are realized as centering diphthongs . Therefore, words such as &quot;peel&quot; and &quot;fool&quot; are often pronounced and .
* The lexical sets and lett are merged as , articulated as the R-colored schwa . Therefore, &quot;further&quot;, pronounced in RP, is in GA. Similarly, the words &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;foreword&quot;, which are phonetically distinguished in RP as and , are homophonous in GA: . Moreover, what is historically , as in &quot;hurry&quot;, merges to in GA as well, so the historical phonemes , , and are all neutralized before . Thus, unlike in most English dialects of England, is not a true phoneme in General American but merely a different notation of for when this phoneme precedes and is stressed—a convention preserved in many sources to facilitate comparisons with other accents.
* The phonetic quality of () is an advanced open-mid back unrounded vowel : .
** Some scholars analyze to be an allophone of that surfaces when stressed, so and may be considered to be in complementary distribution, comprising only one phoneme.

The 2006 &quot;Atlas of North American English&quot; surmises that &quot;if one were to recognize a type of North American English to be called &#x27;General American&#x27;&quot; according to data measurements of vowel pronunciations, &quot;it would be the configuration formed by these three&quot; dialect regions: Canada, the American West, and the American Midland. The following charts present the vowels that converge across these three dialect regions to form an unmarked or generic American English sound system.

<doc id="103976" wikidata="Q277204" url="?curid=103976" title="Convention of Cintra">
<text>The Convention of Cintra (or Sintra) was an agreement signed on 30 August 1808, during the Peninsular War. By the agreement, the defeated French were allowed to evacuate their troops from Portugal without further conflict. The convention was signed at the Palace of Queluz, in Queluz, Cintra, Estremadura.

==Background==
The French forces, under Jean-Andoche Junot, were defeated at Vimeiro by the Anglo-Portuguese forces, commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley on 21 August and found themselves almost cut off from retreat. However, at that moment, Wellesley was superseded by the arrival of Sir Harry Burrard and then the next day by Sir Hew Dalrymple. Both were cautious men and had seen little recent fighting; rather than push the French, they were satisfied to open negotiations. Wellesley had sought to take control of the Torres Vedras area&#x27;s high ground and cut the French retreat with his unused reserve, but he was ordered to hold. Talks between Dalrymple and François Kellerman led to the signing of the convention.

==Terms==
Dalrymple allowed terms for Portugal similar to those a garrison might receive for surrendering a fortress: 20,900 French troops were evacuated from Portugal to Rochefort with all their equipment and personal property by the Royal Navy. Junot arrived there on 11 October. Avoiding all Spanish entanglements and getting free transport meant that the French would travel loaded, instead of lightly like a defeated garrison marching to its own lines.

==Aftermath==
The convention was seen as a disgrace by many in the United Kingdom, who felt that a complete defeat of Junot had been transformed into a French escape, and Dalrymple had also ignored the Royal Navy&#x27;s concern about a blockaded Russian squadron in Lisbon. The squadron was allowed to sail to Portsmouth and eventually to return to Russia although Britain and Russia were at war.

Wellesley wanted to fight, but he signed the preliminary armistice under orders. Dalrymple&#x27;s reports were written to centre any criticism on Wellesley, who still held a ministerial post in the government. Wellesley was subsequently recalled from Portugal, together with Burrard and Dalrymple, to face an official inquiry. The inquiry was held in the Great Hall at the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 14 November to 27 December 1808. Wellesley defended himself by saying that there was no reason to oppose Junot&#x27;s terms of surrender, as they were technically lawful. All three men were cleared, but while Wellesley soon returned to active duty in Portugal, Burrard and Dalrymple were quietly pushed into retirement and never saw active service again. Sir John Moore, commenting on the inquiry, expressed the popular sentiment: &quot;Sir Hew Dalrymple was confused and incapable beyond any man I ever saw head an army. The whole of his conduct then and since has proved him to be a very foolish man&quot;.

==Legacy==
Lord Byron lamented the convention in his &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;:
The future British Poet Laureate William Wordsworth wrote a pamphlet, &quot;The Convention of Cintra&quot;, in 1808. He also wrote a passionate sonnet, &quot;Composed while the author was engaged in writing a tract&quot;, that laments the bondage felt by &quot;suffering Spain&quot; although the Convention concerned only Portugal. The poem was included in his &quot;Sonnets Dedicated to Liberty&quot;. Delays in publication meant that journalistic and satirical features of Wordsworth&#x27;s prose have been overlooked.

<text>Mid-Yare NNR is a national nature reserve in Norfolk, east of Norwich, established by English Nature and managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). The reserve is made up of four RSPB reserves: Strumpshaw Fen, Buckenham Marshes and Cantley Marshes on the north bank of the Yare, and Surlingham Church Marsh on the south bank.

The reserve consists of floodplains along the River Yare, and the total area is 7.8 km2. It centres on the Strumpshaw area.

The alder carr and willow carr support the swallowtail butterfly and the Norfolk hawker dragonfly &quot;Aeshna isosceles&quot;, as well as marsh harriers, bearded tits and Cetti&#x27;s warblers.

The wet grasslands hold internationally important numbers of Eurasian wigeon, nationally important numbers of European white-fronted goose, and Britain&#x27;s largest flock of bean goose, as well as northern lapwing, common redshank and common snipe.

The RSPB controls the water levels, maintains the dykes, cuts the reed beds and keeps disturbance of the wildlife to a minimum.

<text>Redgrave and Lopham Fens is a 127 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest between Thelnetham in Suffolk and Diss in Norfolk. England. It is a national nature reserve, a Ramsar internationally important wetland site, a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I, and part of the Waveney and Little Ouse Valley Fens Special Area of Conservation. It is managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust.

It is the largest remaining area of river valley fen in England and consists of a number of different fen types, including saw-sedge beds, as well as having areas of open water, heathland, scrub and woodland. It is also one of only three sites in the UK where the fen raft spider (&quot;Dolomedes plantarius&quot;) is known to be found.

==Ecology==
The habitats present at Redgrave and Lopham are characteristic of areas of valley mire. This ecosystem creates a zonation of vegetation types, producing a diverse range of habitat. Dry marginal woodland becomes fen grassland, dominated by purple moor-grass, which grades into mixed fenland of reed and sedge beds. This grassland is particularly notable at Redgrave and Lopham for its areas of saw sedge (&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot;).

Into these areas of fenland protrude sandy ridges covered in heath vegetation. Without management these communities become invaded by sallow and develop into scrubland. To maintain site diversity, this has been allowed to occur in some areas of the fen.
These habitats maintain a community of plants and animals, with the site being particularly known for its diversity of invertebrate species. Surveys have identified nineteen species of dragonfly and 27 species of butterfly at the fen, which has also long been recognised for its nationally important population of the fen raft spider (&quot;Dolomedes plantarius&quot;).

Further surveys have also found 26 species of mammals, including otter, pipistrelle bats and introduced species such as the Chinese water deer. The site has also recorded 4 species of amphibian and 4 species of reptile and a 2006 survey recorded 96 species of bird visiting the fen.

==Management==
To maintain and improve the diversity of species and quality of habitat at the site continual management is required. Suffolk Wildlife Trust employs a Site Manager and Assistant Warden to run and monitor the site but also relies on volunteers to carry out management work. Such work includes rush mowing, sedge harvesting, scrub clearance, coppicing and fence construction. The site has also introduced a successful grazing regime to reduce the cost incurred from mowing such a large area of fen. It actively manages the fen raft spider population.

===Grazing===
The site uses sheep, cattle and ponies as part of its management strategy. This has visibly benefited the fen structure and means only the larger saw sedge beds are now on a manual cutting rotation. The use of grazing has led to the emergence of a greater mosaic of vegetation and habitat types within the fen and has inhibited the expansion of scrub.

Hebridean sheep owned by the trust and beef cattle from local farms graze on the dryer areas of scrub, heath and fen margins and help prevent the expansion of scrub. In 1995 the reserve introduced a herd of Polish Konik ponies to graze the wetter areas of the fen. They were chosen over native breeds for their hardiness and ability to graze in very wet conditions. The success of the Konik ponies has led to their use for grazing in other nature reserves in the UK and on the Broads. The cattle and Konik are usually kept on the fen between April and December which avoids the wettest and most barren months of the year.

===Fen raft spider===
Redgrave and Lopham Fens was the first site in the UK at which a population of the fen raft spider (&quot;Dolomedes plantarius&quot;) was recorded. Following their discovery in 1956 a number of new pools were dug to encourage population expansion. However, water extraction from the borehole and a series of droughts in the 1980s reduced the population to only two isolated areas on the reserve. Throughout this period irrigation of the pools inhabited by the spider enabled the continuation of the population.

The removal of the borehole in 1999 was expected to trigger an increase in population as water levels returned to normal. However, a study carried out in 2006 showed that no noticeable change had occurred. The population of the fen raft spider remains small and restricted in distribution. Recommendations for future management of the population include increasing the depths of turf pool, creating more pool habitats and greater, more focused use of water management in the reserve.

==Access and facilities==
The reserve is open to the public all year round. It has an Education Centre which it uses to host family activity days, school trips and adult education courses. There is a picnic area and toilet facilities. It has three dedicated nature trails of 2, 3 and 4.5 km lengths, some of which are accessible by wheelchair. . .

==History==
===Pre-1959===
Redgrave and Lopham Fens lies at the headwaters of the Waveney and Little Ouse rivers and had for centuries provided natural resources for the local population. This activity created and maintained the various habitats of the fen. The cutting of peat for fuel lead to the creation of open pools edged in reedbeds and the pathways between them became species-rich fen meadows. Sedge and reed were cut for thatching, furze and other vegetation was removed for livestock bedding and firewood. Cattle and other livestock were also grazed on the meadow, heath and other marginal land around the fens. This removed any invading species, prevented ecological succession from occurring and preserved the diversity of the fenland. However, with the industrialisation of farming and the wider use of fossil fuels the traditional use and management of the fen began to decline.

In 1954 Redgrave and Lopham Fens was given the status as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the nationally important presence of the fen raft spider and the diversity of its fenland.

===1959-1991===
In 1959 a borehole was drilled at the fen to provide drinking water for the local population, with a capacity to take 3,600m3 of water every day from the underlying aquifer. This diverted water from the springs that fed the fen and the water table began to fall. This led to a change in the fen&#x27;s hydrology in the early 1960s as it went from a year-round water supply to alternating summer drought and winter floods. With a net loss of water this caused the fen to begin to dry out.

The loss of water and lack of management led to the degradation of the fen, and scrub began to invade large areas. In 1961 the Suffolk Wildlife Trust gained control of the site but insufficient resources meant the large scale work they wished to carry out to return it to its previous state could not be achieved; the condition of the overall fen continued to decline.

===1991-present===
In the early 1990s Redgrave and Lopham Fens gained wider recognition for its importance. Thus it was designated a Ramsar site in 1991 and gained national nature reserve status in 1993. At this time the Environment Agency undertook studies to determine the extent of damage to the fen and how restoration could best be carried out. This led to a large scale and internationally recognised restoration project, costing approximately £3.4 million.

==Restoration project==
The restoration of the reserve was split into three key areas: the relocation of the borehole, the restoration of the river and the restoration of the fen, with a budget of £2.2 million, £0.4 million and £0.8 million respectively. The European Commission funded 50% of this cost from the LIFE Fund.

===Borehole relocation===
In order to re-establish the original fen water regime it was recommended that the borehole removing water from the system be relocated and that the new borehole provide sufficient water without damaging the fenland. To fit these requirements a large search for a suitable site was carried out with many test sites drilled and tested. Eventually a site was located 3 km southeast of the reserve and planning and construction of the new borehole was carried out at a cost of £1.2 million. This was the first time a public water borehole was relocated on solely environmental grounds.

The onsite borehole was shut down in July 1999 and within one month significant increases in water levels were recorded. By summer 2002 the maximum groundwater recharge level was believed to have been reached and the hydrological recovery closely followed modeling predictions. This return to natural levels of water supply has helped solve many ecological problems, with peat soils and reed beds now having sufficient water throughout the year. The many old peat cuttings have also filled with water, creating small pools filled with vegetation at various stages of succession throughout the reserve.

===River restoration===
The reserve is divided by the River Waveney and the river can have a great impact on the fen ecology if mismanaged. The restoration project aimed to raise the water level within the river, restore the river ecology to its previous state and improve its habitats. To achieve this two fully adjustable sluice gates were introduced to the river course. These would allow direct control of water levels within the fen and protect the site from flooding or drought events. The banks of the river were also reworked to create greater areas of marginal habitat and the shallow bank shelves that are of interest to wildlife such as water voles. The material removed from the bank was reformed to create flood defense levees alongside the river.

===Fen restoration===
The third stage of the project was to recreate the conditions that would allow the most important fen communities to become re-established. This would involve a number of different tasks but mainly focused on scrub and tree clearance and peat stripping operations. Around 80 hectares of wood and scrub were identified for clearance, all of which has now been removed and has opened up land to be reclaimed by the fen habitat. Due to the lack of water over the years large areas of peat had degraded. To restore the fen to its previous state the decision was made to strip off the peat down to a level where it was undamaged and allow natural growth from that point. By 2002 around 250,000 tonnes of peat had been removed and a number of large pools surrounded by reed bed were created. Eventually the annual growth and dieback of the fen vegetation will restart the process of forming new peat.

<doc id="103990" wikidata="Q15224502" url="?curid=103990" title="Holkham National Nature Reserve">
<text>Holkham National Nature Reserve is England&#x27;s largest national nature reserve (NNR). It is on the Norfolk coast between Burnham Overy Staithe and Blakeney, and is managed by Natural England with the cooperation of the Holkham Estate. Its comprise a wide range of habitats, including grazing marsh, woodland, salt marsh, sand dunes and foreshore. The reserve is part of the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the larger area is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, and is part of both an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a World Biosphere Reserve. Holkham NNR is important for its wintering wildfowl, especially pink-footed geese, Eurasian wigeon and brant geese, but it also has breeding waders, and attracts many migrating birds in autumn. Many scarce invertebrates and plants can be found in the dunes, and the reserve is one of the only two sites in the UK to have an antlion colony.

This stretch of coast originally consisted of salt marshes protected from the sea by ridges of shingle and sand, and Holkham&#x27;s Iron Age fort stood at the end of a sandy spit surrounded by the tidal wetland. The Vikings navigated the creeks to establish Holkham village, but access to the former harbour was stopped by drainage and reclamation of the marshes between the coast and the shingle ridge which started in the 17th century, and was completed in 1859. The Holkham estate has been owned by the Coke family, later Earls of Leicester since 1609, and their seat at Holkham Hall is opposite the reserve&#x27;s Lady Anne&#x27;s Drive entrance. The 3rd Earl planted pines on the dunes to protect the pastures reclaimed by his predecessors from wind-blown sand. The national nature reserve was created in 1967 from of the Holkham Estate and of foreshore belonging to the Crown.

The reserve has over 100,000 visitors a year, including birdwatchers and horse riders, and is therefore significant for the local economy. The NNR has taken steps to control entry to the fragile dunes and other areas important for their animals or plants because of the damage to sensitive habitats that could be caused by unrestricted access. The dunes are an essential natural defence against the projected rises in sea level along this vulnerable coast.

== Description ==

The reserve lies to the north of the A149 coast road, starting just west of Burnham Overy Staithe and extending west past Holkham to Beach Road, Wells-next-the-Sea. It also includes the tidal salt marshes continuing further east to Blakeney. Its total area of about makes it the largest NNR in England. The reserve can be accessed by footpaths from Wells and the local villages including the Peddars Way/Norfolk Coast long-distance trail that traverses the main part of the reserve, and National Cycle Route 1 loops through the core of the NNR between Holkham and Wells. There is a car park near Holkham village at the north end of Lady Anne&#x27;s Drive that gives access to two bird hides, and another parking area at the end of Beach Road in Wells. To the east of the Wells Channel, the reserve is mainly salt marshes and mud flats, and is difficult and potentially dangerous to access, although a public footpath runs along the southern edge of these tidal areas.

The salt marshes on this coast are stated in the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) notification document to be &quot;among the best in Europe ... the flora is exceptionally diverse&quot;. Holkham also has good examples of sand dunes, and the pines planted on the dunes have provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established, making this the only substantial area of woodland in the North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The dunes are created and altered by the elements, and the sand islands in Holkham Bay have formed only within the last 60 years. The flat ground inland from the dunes is a reclaimed salt marsh that was used as pasture until the 1940s, but converted to arable land during World War II. The value of the fields to wildlife was reduced by the resulting lower water table, but Natural England&#x27;s management measures have raised the water levels, attracting breeding and wintering birds. Water management can also be used to ensure a high water table in summer, benefiting breeding waders, and drier conditions in winter, preferred by the geese. The management of water levels and grassland increased the number of breeding wetland birds from 120 pairs of ten species in 1986 to 795 pairs of 26 species in 1994, and the number of wintering birds of four key wildfowl species rose from 1,215 to 17,305 in the decade from 1983/84.

== History ==
Norfolk has a long history of human occupation. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000–5,000 BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland.

The coast at Holkham originally consisted of salt marshes protected from the sea by ridges of shingle and sand.
A large Iron Age fort (Holkham Camp) at the end of a sandy spit in the marshes could only be approached along the spit; it enclosed and remained in use until the defeat of the Iceni in 47 AD. The Vikings navigated the tidal creeks to establish Holkham, the name deriving from the Danish for &quot;ship town&quot;.

The Holkham Estate has been owned by the Coke family since 1609, and Holkham Hall, built by Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester between 1734 and 1764, is opposite the NNR entrance. Until the 17th century, ships could navigate the tidal creeks to reach the staithe (harbour) at Holkham village, but local landowners began to reclaim the marshes from 1639, and the final embankment at Wells was constructed by the 2nd Earl in 1859, completing the conversion of about to farmland. The 3rd Earl planted Corsican, maritime and Scots pines on the dunes in the late 19th century to shelter the agricultural land from wind-blown sand, which is carried inland when the wind speed exceeds and blows from directions between northwest to northeast.

The Holkham National Nature Reserve was created in 1967 from of the Holkham Estate and of intertidal sand and mud flats belonging to the Crown Estate. In 1986 the NNR was subsumed into the newly created North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The coast from Holkham NNR to Salthouse, together with Scolt Head Island, is a Biosphere Reserve.

== Flora and fauna ==

=== Birds ===
As many as 50,000 pink-footed geese, 13,000 Eurasian wigeon and 7,000 Brent geese winter at Holkham, making it of international importance for these species. Up to 400 white-fronted geese and a few tundra bean geese may join the wildfowl flocks, and the odd peregrine falcon, short-eared owl, merlin, marsh harrier or hen harrier may hunt over the fields. The shingle banks and foreshore hold wintering flocks of shore larks, snow buntings and twite, and waders like knots, curlews, dunlins and grey plover probe for invertebrates in the mud flats.

Spring migration is relatively quiet, although sightings of ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst the more common arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small grey heron colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. In 2020, a pair of cattle egrets successfully bred at the site, the first time the species had successfully bred in Norfolk. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.

Holkham&#x27;s north-facing coastal location can attract large numbers of migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with north to north-east wind. The common species may be accompanied by a wryneck, red-backed shrike or greenish warbler in August, with goldcrests, thrushes and finches later in the season, and perhaps red-breasted flycatchers and yellow-browed warblers. Vagrant rarities such as Pallas&#x27;s, Radde&#x27;s or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2019, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.

=== Other animals and plants ===

Brown hares and European otters are found all along the north Norfolk coast, but red squirrels disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981. The rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham, one of only two sites along this coast, although the common frog, common toad and common lizard are widespread in appropriate habitats.

The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and ghost moth are sometimes seen in the woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies can be found in the dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.

On exposed parts of the coast, the mud and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no vegetation except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.

Grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass are important in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird&#x27;s-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow belt of pines shelters creeping lady&#x27;s tresses and yellow bird&#x27;s nest.

== Recreation ==
A 2005 survey at Holkham and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Holkham NNR is one of three sites within the SSSI that attract 100,000 or more visitors annually, the others being Titchwell Marsh and Cley Marshes. The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as Ringed Plovers and Little Terns, and also for wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as dunes and vegetated shingles. The discovery of the nationally rare tiny earthstar fungus at Holkham led its finders to state that &quot;The survival of this species in Britain would undoubtedly benefit from the construction of a boardwalk across this fragile and frequently-visited habitat.&quot;

The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven per cent of the British population, is cordoned off in the breeding season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, and the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked to stay on the beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.

The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divides the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes. Holkham Dunes, along with Holme Dunes and Blakeney Point, were considered to be sensitive habitats already suffering from visitor pressure, and were designated as red-zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. The rest of the NNR is placed in the orange zone, for locations with fragile habitats but less tourism pressure.

== Threats ==

The underlying geology of the North Norfolk coast is Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs just to the west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with the sea level rising an estimated 1–2 mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.

Half the area of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been reclaimed in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency&#x27;s management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness in the face of a potential sea level rise of by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.

<text>Tuvaluan (), often called Tuvalu, is a Polynesian language closely related to the Ellicean group spoken in Tuvalu. It is more or less distantly related to all other Polynesian languages, such as Hawaiian, Māori, Tahitian, Samoan, Tokelauan and Tongan, and most closely related to the languages spoken on the Polynesian Outliers in Micronesia and Northern and Central Melanesia. Tuvaluan has borrowed considerably from Samoan, the language of Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The population of Tuvalu is approximately 10,645 people (2017 Mini Census), but there are estimated to be more than 13,000 Tuvaluan speakers worldwide. In 2015 it was estimated that more than 3,500 Tuvaluans live in New Zealand, with about half that number born in New Zealand and 65 percent of the Tuvaluan community in New Zealand is able to speak Tuvaluan.

== Name variations ==
Native speakers of Tuvaluan have various names for their language. In the language itself, it is often referred to as which translates to &quot;the Tuvaluan language&quot;, or less formally as , meaning &quot;our language&quot;. The dialects of Vaitupi and Funafuti are together known as a standard language called , meaning ‘the common language’. Formerly, the country of Tuvalu was known as the Ellice Islands and the Tuvaluan language is also therefore known as &quot;Ellice&quot; or &quot;Ellicean.&quot;

== History ==
Like all other Polynesian languages, Tuvaluan descends from an ancestral language, which historical linguists refer to as &quot;Proto-Polynesian&quot;, which was spoken perhaps about 2,000 years ago.

== Language influences ==
Tuvaluan has had significant contact with Gilbertese, a Micronesian language; Samoan; and, increasingly, English. Gilbertese is spoken natively on Nui, and was important to Tuvaluans when its colonial administration was located in the Gilbert Islands. Samoan was introduced by missionaries, and has had the most impact on the language. During an intense period of colonization throughout Oceania in the nineteenth century, the Tuvaluan language was influenced by Samoan missionary-pastors. In an attempt to &quot;Christianize&quot; Tuvaluans, linguistic promotion of the Samoan language was evident in its use for official government acts and literacy instruction, as well as within the church, until being replaced by the Tuvaluan language in the 1950s.

English&#x27;s influence has been limited, but is growing. Since gaining political independence in the 1970s, knowledge of the English language has gained importance for economic viability in Tuvalu. The ability to speak English is important for foreign communications and is often the language used in business and governmental settings.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
The sound system of Tuvaluan consists of five vowels (). All vowels come in short and long forms, which are contrastive.

There are no diphthongs so every vowel is sounded separately. Example: ‘tomorrow’ is pronounced as four separate syllables (ta-e-a-o).

=== Consonants ===

The sound system of Tuvaluan consists of 10 or 11 consonants (), depending on the dialect. All consonants also come in short and geminated (long) forms, which are contrastive. The phoneme is written . All other sounds are represented with letters corresponding to their IPA symbols.

=== Phonotactics ===
Like most Polynesian languages, Tuvaluan syllables can either be V or CV. Both vowels and consonants can be long or short. There is no restriction on the placement of consonants, although they cannot be used at the end of words (as per the syllabic restrictions). Consonant clusters are not present in Tuvaluan.

===Phonology of loanwords===
None of the units in the Tuvaluan phonemic inventory are restricted to loanwords only. English is the only language from which loanwords are currently being borrowed – loans from Samoan and Gilbertese have already been adapted to fit Tuvaluan phonology. More established, conventional English borrowings are more likely to have been adapted to the standard phonology than those that have been adopted more recently.

===Stress, gemination and lengthening===
Stress is on the penultimate mora. Geminated consonants have the following main functions:

* Pluralisation – e.g. &#x27;sit&#x27; (singular) v &#x27;sit&#x27; (plural)
* Contraction of reduplicated syllable – e.g. &#x27;good&#x27; in Northern dialects becomes in Southern dialects.
* Contraction of the definite article – e.g. &#x27;the man&#x27; becomes .
* Differentiation of meaning between two words – e.g. &#x27;overcooked&#x27; v &#x27;plague&#x27;

Long vowels can be used to indicate pluralisation or a differentiation of meaning.

== Word order ==
Like many Polynesian languages, Tuvaluan generally uses a VSO word order, with the verb often preceded by a verb marker. However, the word order is very flexible, and there are more exceptions to the VSO standard than sentences which conform to it. Besnier (p. 134) demonstrates that VSO is statistically the least frequent word order, and OVS is the most frequent word order, but still believes VSO is syntactically the default. Often if emphasis is to be placed on a first person pronoun or personal name, then it may precede the verb so that the sentence structure becomes SVO.

== Morphology ==
In Tuvaluan, there is virtually no inflectional or derivational morphology – Tuvaluan uses markers to indicate case, tense, plurality, etc. The table below, adapted from Jackson&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to Tuvaluan&quot;, outlines the main markers, although there are also negative and imperative derivatives. Vowel gemination can also sometimes illustrate semantic change.

Reduplication is one of the most common morphological devices in Tuvalu, and works in a wide variety of ways. Firstly, it operates on verbs and adjectives. Jackson lists six ways it can function:

* Intensification of action:

* Diminished action:

* Continued, repeated action:

* A more widely distributed activity:

* Pluralisation:

* Change of meaning:
The prefix is another interesting aspect of Tuvaluan. It operates as a ‘causative’ – to make a verb more ‘active’, or shapes an adjective ‘in the manner of’. Jackson describes as the most important prefix in Tuvaluan.


Adjectives:

Verbs:

== Verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs ==

Tuvaluan tends to favour using verbs over nouns. Nouns can be formed from many verbs by adding the suffix . In the Southern dialect, the addition of lengthens the final vowel of the verb root of the new noun. Many nouns can also be used as verbs.
Tuvaluan relies heavily on the use of verbs. There are many ‘state of being’ words which are verbs in Tuvaluan, which would be classified as adjectives in English. Generally, verbs can be identified by the tense marker which precedes them (usually immediately, but occasionally separated by adverbs). Verbs do not change form because of tense, and only occasionally undergo gemination in the plural. Passive and reciprocal verbs undergo some changes by the use of affixes, but these forms are used infrequently and usually apply to loan words from Samoan.

The distinction between verb and adjective is often only indicated by the use of verb/tense markers and the position of the word in the sentence. Adjectives always follow the noun they reference. Adjectives regularly change in the plural form (by gemination) where nouns do not. Many adjectives can become abstract nouns by adding the definite article te, or a pronoun, before the adjective. This is similar to English adjectives adding the suffix -ness to an adjective to form a noun.

Adverbs usually follow the verb they apply to, although there are some notable exceptions to this rule.

== Articles ==
There are three possible articles in Tuvaluan: definite singular , indefinite singular or (depending on the dialect) and indefinite plural or (depending on the dialect). Indefinite and definite concepts are applied differently in Tuvaluan from English. The singular definite te refers to something or someone that the speaker and the audience know, or have already mentioned – as opposed to the indefinite, which is not specifically known or has not been mentioned. The Tuvaluan word for ‘that’ or ‘this’ (in its variations derivations) is often used to indicate a more definite reference.

== Pronouns ==
Like many other Polynesian languages, the Tuvaluan pronoun system distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive, and singular, dual and plural forms (see table below). However, it does not distinguish between gender, instead relying on contextual references to the involved persons or things (when it is necessary to identify ‘it’). This often involves the use of (‘male’) or (‘female’) as an adjective or affix to illustrate information about gender.

===Possessive pronouns===
Possessive pronouns are composed of three elements: a full or reduced article; designation of (inalienable) or (alienable) for the possession; an additional suffix related to personal pronoun. Whether an object is designated alienable (&quot;a&quot; class) or inalienable (&quot;o&quot; class) depends on the class of object. Inalienable generally includes body parts, health, origin, objects acquired through inheritance, personal things in close contact to the body, emotions and sensations, and ‘traditional’ possession (e.g., canoes, axes, spears, lamps).

== Dialects ==

Tuvaluan is divided into two groups of dialects, Northern Tuvaluan, comprising dialects spoken on the islands of Nanumea, Nanumaga, and Niutao and Southern Tuvaluan, comprising dialects spoken on the islands of Funafuti, Vaitupu, Nukufetau and Nukulaelae. All dialects are mutually intelligible, and differ in terms of phonology, morphology, and lexicon. The Funafuti-Vaitupu dialects are together known as a standard language called , meaning ‘the common language’ and is the &quot;de facto&quot; national language, although speakers of the Northern dialects often use their own dialect in public contexts outside of their own communities. The inhabitants of one island of Tuvalu, Nui, speak a dialect of Gilbertese, an Oceanic language less related to Tuvaluan.

Tuvaluan is mutually intelligible with Tokelauan, spoken by the approximately 1,700 inhabitants of the three atolls of Tokelau and on Swains Island, as well as the several thousand Tokelauan migrants living in New Zealand.

== Literature ==
The Bible was translated into Tuvaluan in 1987. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses publish Watchtower Magazine on a monthly basis in Tuvaluan. There is also an &quot;Introduction to Tuvaluan&quot; &amp; &quot;Tuvaluan Dictionary&quot; both by Geoffrey Jackson. Apart from this, there are very few Tuvaluan language books available. The Tuvalu Media Department provides Tuvaluan language radio programming and publishes &quot;Fenui News&quot;, a Facebook page and email newsletter.

A Tuvaluan writer Afaese Manoa (1942–) wrote the song &quot;Tuvalu for the Almighty (Tuvaluan: )&quot;, adopted in 1978 as Tuvalu&#x27;s national anthem.

==Oral traditions==
Although Tuvaluan does not have a longstanding written tradition, there is a considerable corpus of oral traditions that is also found in the Music of Tuvalu, which includes material that pre-dates the influence of the Christian missionaries sent to Tuvalu by the London Missionary Society. The missionaries were predominantly from Samoa and they both suppressed oral traditions that they viewed as not being consistent with Christian teaching and they also influenced the development of the music of Tuvalu and the Tuvaluan language.

According to linguist Thomason, &quot;some artistic forms are inextricably tied to the language they are expressed in.&quot; A report on the sustainable development of Tuvalu posits the sustainability of traditional songs depends on the vitality of the Tuvaluan language. Grammatical documentation of the Tuvaluan language indicates that various linguistic features have been preserved specifically within domains of verbal art. For example, the use of passives in Tuvaluan has become obsolete, except in folklore and ancient songs.

==Academic study and major publications==
Tuvaluan is one of the least documented languages of Polynesia. There has been limited work done on Tuvaluan from an English-speaking perspective. The first major work on Tuvaluan syntax was done by Donald Gilbert Kennedy, who published a &quot;Handbook on the language of the Tuvalu (Ellice) Islands&quot; in 1945. Niko Besnier has published the greatest amount of academic material on Tuvaluan – both descriptive and lexical. Besnier&#x27;s description of Tuvaluan uses a phonemic orthography which differs from the ones most commonly used by Tuvaluans - which sometimes do not distinguish geminate consonants. Jackson&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to Tuvaluan&quot; is a useful guide to the language from a first contact point of view. The orthography used by most Tuvaluans is based on Samoan, and, according to Besnier, isn&#x27;t well-equipped to deal with important difference in vowel and consonant length which often perform special functions in the Tuvaluan language. Throughout this profile, Besnier&#x27;s orthography is used as it best represents the linguistic characteristics under discussion.

== Risk of endangerment ==
Isolation of minority-language communities &quot;promotes&quot; maintenance of the language. Due to global increases in temperature, rising sea levels threaten the islands of Tuvalu. Researchers acknowledges that within a &quot;few years&quot;, the Pacific Ocean may engulf Tuvalu, swallowing not only the land, but its people and their language. In response to this risk, the Tuvaluan government made an agreement with the country of New Zealand in 2002 that agreed to allow the migration of 11,000 Tuvaluans (the island nation&#x27;s entire population). The gradual resettlement of Tuvaluans in New Zealand means a loss of isolation for speakers from the larger society they are joining that situates them as a minority-language community. As more Tuvaluans continue to migrate to New Zealand and integrate themselves into the culture and society, relative isolation decreases, contributing to the language&#x27;s endangerment.

Lack of isolation due to forced migration since 2002 has contributed to the endangerment of the Tuvaluan language and may further threaten it as more Tuvaluans are removed from their isolated linguistic communities.

<doc id="104020" wikidata="Q220775" url="?curid=104020" title="C-4 (explosive)">
<text>C-4 or Composition C-4 is a common variety of the plastic explosive family known as Composition C, which uses RDX as its explosive agent. C-4 is composed of explosives, plastic binder, plasticizer to make it malleable, and usually a marker or odorizing taggant chemical. C-4 has a texture similar to modelling clay and can be molded into any desired shape. C-4 is relatively insensitive and can be detonated only by the shock wave from a detonator or blasting cap.

A similar British plastic explosive, also based on RDX but with a plasticizer different from that used in Composition C-4, is known as PE-4 (Plastic Explosive No. 4).

== Development ==
C-4 is a member of the Composition C family of chemical explosives. Variants have different proportions and plasticisers and include compositions C-2, C-3, and C-4. The original RDX-based material was developed by the British during World War II and redeveloped as Composition C when introduced to the U.S. military. It was replaced by Composition C-2 around 1943 and later redeveloped around 1944 as Composition C-3. The toxicity of C-3 was reduced, the concentration of RDX was increased, giving it improved safety during usage and storage. Research on a replacement for C-3 was begun prior to 1950, but the new material, C-4, did not begin pilot production until 1956. C-4 was submitted for patent as &quot;Solid Propellant and a Process for its Preparation&quot; March 31, 1958, by the Phillips Petroleum Company.

== Characteristics and uses ==

=== Composition ===
The Composition C-4 used by the United States Armed Forces contains 91% RDX (&quot;Research Department Explosive&quot;, an explosive nitroamine), bound by a mixture of 5.3% dioctyl sebacate (DOS) or dioctyl adipate (DOA) as the plasticizer (to increase the plasticity of the explosive), thickened with 2.1% polyisobutylene (PIB, a synthetic rubber) as the binder, and 1.6% of a mineral oil often called &quot;process oil&quot;. Instead of &quot;process oil&quot;, low-viscosity motor oil is used in the manufacture of C-4 for civilian use.

The British PE4 consists of 88.0% RDX, 1.0% pentaerythrite dioleate and 11.0% DG-29 lithium grease (corresp. to 2.2% lithium stearate and 8.8% mineral oil BP) as the binder; a taggant (2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane, DMDNB) is added at a minimum of 0.10% weight of the plastic explosive, typically at 1.0% mass. The newer PE7 consists of 88.0% RDX, 1.0% DMDNB taggant and 11.0% of a binder composed of low molecular mass hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, along with an antioxidant and an agent preventing hardening of the binder upon prolonged storage. The PE8 consists of 86.5% RDX, 1.0% DMDNB taggant and 12.5% of a binder composed of di(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate thickened with high molecular mass polyisobutylene.

Technical data according to the Department of the Army for the Composition C-4 follows.
==== Manufacture ====
C-4 is manufactured by combining the above ingredients with binders dissolved in a solvent. Once the ingredients have been mixed, the solvent is extracted through drying and filtering. The final material is a solid with a dirty white to light brown color, a putty-like texture similar to modeling clay, and a distinct smell of motor oil. Depending on its intended usage and on the manufacturer, there are differences in the composition of C-4. For example, a 1990 U.S. Army technical manual stipulated that Class IV composition C-4 consists of 89.9±1% RDX, 10±1% polyisobutylene, and 0.2±0.02% dye that is itself made up of 90% lead chromate and 10% lamp black. RDX classes A, B, E, and H are all suitable for use in C-4. Classes are measured by granulation.

The manufacturing process for Composition C-4 specifies that wet RDX and plastic binder are added in a stainless steel mixing kettle. This is called the aqueous slurry-coating process. The kettle is tumbled to obtain a homogeneous mixture. This mixture is wet and must be dried after transfer to drying trays. Drying with forced air for 16 hours at 50 °C to 60 °C is recommended to eliminate excess moisture.

C-4 produced for use by the U.S. military, commercial C-4 (also produced in the United States), and PE-4 from the United Kingdom each have their own unique properties and are not identical. The analytical techniques of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been demonstrated to discriminate finite differences in different C-4 sources. Chemical, morphological structural differences, and variation in atomic concentrations are detectable and definable.

=== Detonation ===
C-4 is very stable and insensitive to most physical shocks. C-4 cannot be detonated by a gunshot or by dropping it onto a hard surface. It does not explode when set on fire or exposed to microwaves. Detonation can be initiated only by a shockwave, such as when a detonator inserted into it is fired.
When detonated, C-4 rapidly decomposes to release nitrogen, water and carbon oxides as well as other gases. The detonation proceeds at an explosive velocity of .

A major advantage of C-4 is that it can easily be molded into any desired shape to change the direction of the resulting explosion. C-4 has high cutting ability. For example, the complete severing of a deep I-beam takes between of C-4 when properly applied in thin sheets.

=== Form ===
Military grade C-4 is commonly packaged as the M112 demolition block. The demolition charge M112 is a rectangular block of Composition C-4 about and long, weighing . The M112 is wrapped in a sometimes olive color Mylar-film container with a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape on one surface.

The M112 demolition blocks of C-4 are commonly manufactured into the M183 &quot;demolition charge assembly&quot;, which consists of 16 M112 block demolition charges and four priming assemblies packaged inside military Carrying Case M85. The M183 is used to breach obstacles or demolish large structures where larger satchel charges are required. Each priming assembly includes a length of detonating cord assembled with detonating cord clips and capped at each end with a booster. When the charge is detonated, the explosive is converted into compressed gas. The gas exerts pressure in the form of a shock wave, which demolishes the target by cutting, breaching, or cratering.

Other forms include the mine-clearing line charge and M18A1 Claymore Mine.

=== Safety ===
Composition C-4 exists in the U.S. Army Hazardous Components Safety Data Sheet on sheet number 00077. Impact tests done by the U.S. military indicate composition C-4 is less sensitive than composition C-3 and is fairly insensitive. The insensitivity is attributed to using a large amount of binder in its composition. A series of shots were fired at vials containing C-4 in a test referred to as &quot;the rifle bullet test&quot;. Only 20% of the vials burned, and none exploded. While C-4 passed the Army&#x27;s bullet impact and fragment impact tests at ambient temperature, it failed the shock stimulus, sympathetic detonation and shaped charge jet tests. Additional tests were done including the &quot;pendulum friction test&quot;, which measured a five-second explosion temperature of 263 °C to 290 °C. The minimum initiating charge required is 0.2 grams of lead azide or 0.1 grams of tetryl. The results of 100 °C heat test are: 0.13% loss in the first 48 hours, no loss in the second 48 hours, and no explosions in 100 hours. The vacuum stability test at 100 °C yields 0.2 cubic centimeters of gas in 40 hours. Composition C-4 is essentially nonhygroscopic.

The shock sensitivity of C-4 is related to the size of the nitramine particles. The finer they are the better they help to absorb and suppress shock. Using 3-nitrotriazol-5-one (NTO), or 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) (available in two particle sizes (5 μm, 40 μm)), as a substitute for RDX, is also able to improve stability to thermal, shock, and impact/friction stimulus; however, TATB is not cost-effective, and NTO is more difficult to use in the manufacturing process.

== Analysis ==
=== Toxicity ===
C-4 has toxic effects on humans when ingested. Within a few hours multiple generalized seizures, vomiting, and changes in mental activity occur. A strong link to central nervous dysfunction is observed. If ingested, patients may be administered a dose of active charcoal to adsorb some of the toxins, and haloperidol intramuscularly and diazepam intravenously to help the patient control seizures until it has passed. However, ingesting small amounts of C-4 is not known to cause any long-term impairment.

=== Investigation ===
If C-4 is marked with a taggant, such as DMNB, it can be detected with an explosive vapor detector before it has been detonated. A variety of methods for explosive residue analysis may be used to identify C-4. These include optical microscope examination and scanning electron microscopy for unreacted explosive, chemical spot tests, thin-layer chromatography, X-ray crystallography, and infrared spectroscopy for products of the explosive chemical reaction. Small particles of C-4 may be easily identified by mixing with thymol crystals and a few drops of sulfuric acid. The mixture will become rose colored upon addition of a small quantity of ethyl alcohol.

RDX has a high birefringence, and the other components commonly found in C-4 are generally isotropic; this makes it possible for forensic science teams to detect trace residue on fingertips of individuals who may have recently been in contact with the compound. However, positive results are highly variable and the mass of RDX can range between 1.7 and 130 ng, each analysis must be individually handled using magnifying equipment. The cross polarized light images obtained from microscopic analysis of the fingerprint are analyzed with gray-scale thresholding to improve contrast for the particles. The contrast is then inverted in order to show dark RDX particles against a light background. Relative numbers and positions of RDX particles have been measured from a series of 50 fingerprints left after a single contact impression.

Military and commercial C-4 are blended with different oils. It is possible to distinguish these sources by analyzing this oil by high-temperature gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The oil and plasticizer must be separated from the C-4 sample, typically by using a non-polar organic solvent such as pentane followed by solid phase extraction of the plasticizer on silica. This method of analysis is limited by manufacturing variation and methods of distribution.

== Use ==
=== Vietnam War ===
U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War era would sometimes use small amounts of C-4 as a fuel for heating rations, as it will burn unless detonated with a primary explosive. However, burning C-4 produces poisonous fumes, and soldiers are warned of the dangers of personal injury when using the plastic explosive.

Among field troops in Vietnam it became common knowledge that ingestion of a small amount of C-4 would produce a &quot;high&quot; similar to that of ethanol. Others would ingest C-4, commonly obtained from a Claymore mine, to induce temporary illness in the hope of being sent on sick leave.

=== Use in terrorism ===
Terrorist groups have used C-4 worldwide in acts of terrorism and insurgency, as well as domestic terrorism and state terrorism.

On May 13, 1985, the Philadelphia Police Department dropped a C-4 bomb on the home of the MOVE organization, killing eleven people — including five children — and wiping out 61 homes in two city blocks.

Composition C-4 is recommended in al-Qaeda&#x27;s traditional curriculum of explosives training. In October 2000, the group used C-4 to attack the USS &quot;Cole&quot;, killing 17 sailors. In 1996, Saudi Hezbollah terrorists used C-4 to blow up the Khobar Towers, a U.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia. Composition C-4 has also been used in improvised explosive devices by Iraqi insurgents.

<text>The Elbe–Lübeck Canal () (also known as the Elbe–Trave Canal) is an artificial waterway in eastern Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It connects the rivers Elbe and Trave, creating an inland water route across the drainage divide from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea. The canal includes seven locks and runs for a length of between the cities of Lübeck in the north and Lauenburg in the south by way of the Mölln lakes. The modern canal was built in the 1890s to replace the Stecknitz Canal, a medieval watercourse linking the same two rivers.

==Preceding canal==
The older Stecknitz Canal had first connected Lauenburg and Lübeck on the Old Salt Route by linking the tiny rivers Stecknitz (a tributary of the Trave) and Delvenau (a tributary of the Elbe). Built between 1391 and 1398, the Stecknitz Canal was the first European summit-level canal and one of the earliest artificial waterways in Europe. 

==History==

After German unification in the late nineteenth century, there was a burst of canal-building within the new German Empire. The Stecknitz Canal had been in service for centuries, but newer vessels demanded deeper and wider canals, and modern engineering offered the possibility of rebuilding and enlarging the venerable waterway. In 1893 the German government closed the Stecknitz Canal to barge traffic, and in 1895 construction began on a widened and straightened waterway which includes some of the old canal&#x27;s watercourse. The new Elbe–Lübeck Canal was inaugurated by German Emperor Wilhelm II and opened to shipping traffic in 1900. Today it continues to carry substantial freight traffic, as well as offering a scenic route for pleasure craft.

==Technology==

The canal passes through two locks ascending from the Elbe to the canal&#x27;s highest point and five locks descending from the high point to the Trave. Each lock was built with an interior length of and an interior width of .

<text>The Woodland Trust is the largest woodland conservation charity in the United Kingdom and is concerned with the creation, protection, and restoration of native woodland heritage. It has planted over 68 million trees since 1972. The Woodland Trust has three aims: to protect ancient woodland which is rare, unique and irreplaceable, to promote the restoration of damaged ancient woodland, and to plant native trees and woods to benefit people and wildlife.

The charity maintains ownership of over 1,000 sites covering over of which 8,070ha (33%) is ancient woodland. It ensures public access to its woods.

==History==

The charity was founded in Devon, England in 1972 by retired farmer and agricultural machinery dealer Kenneth Watkins.

The Trust&#x27;s first purchase was part of the Avon Valley Woods, near Kingsbridge, Devon. By 1977 it had 22 woods in six counties. In 1978 it relocated to Grantham in Lincolnshire and announced an expansion of its activities across the UK. In 1984, Balmacaan Wood next to Loch Ness became the Trust&#x27;s first Scottish acquisition.

From 2005 to 2008, the charity co-operated with the BBC for their &quot;Springwatch&quot; programme and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breathing Places&quot; series of events held at woods. It continues to work with Springwatch and Autumnwatch, most recently in 2015 as part of the Big Spring Watch, which encouraged viewers to record the signs of nature (phenology) through the Trust&#x27;s Nature&#x27;s Calendar project.

=== Sites ===
As of 2024, the Woodland Trust had over 60 woods in Scotland, covering 11,000 hectares.

In Wales, it acquired the Coed Lletywalter in Snowdonia National Park in 1980. In 2024 it had over 100 woods covering almost 3,000 hectares in Wales.

Work started in Northern Ireland in 1996 when the charity received a grant from the Millennium Commission to set up over 50 community woods in a scheme called Woods on Your Doorstep.

===Headquarters===
Its first employee and director, John James, came from Lincolnshire and was living in Nottingham at the time. It had a small office in Grantham, Lincolnshire. James was chief executive from 1992 to 1997, and then Michael Townsend from 1997 to 2004, Sue Holden from 2004 to 2014 and Beccy Speight from 2014 to 2019. The current chief executive is Darren Moorcroft.

A new eco-friendly headquarters, adjacent to the former offices, was completed in 2010 at a cost of . The building, designed by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios as architect and Atelier One as structural engineer, incorporates light shelves to distribute natural daylight around the 200 workstations, and concrete panels to absorb daytime heat, to provide the thermal mass that the lightweight wooden structure would otherwise lack. It is estimated that compared to a concrete framed construction, the timber structure saved the equivalent in carbon production as nine years of the building&#x27;s operation.

==Structure==
The Woodland Trust&#x27;s head office is in Grantham, south Lincolnshire, and there are regional offices across the UK. It employs around 300 people at its Grantham headquarters. Its current president is Clive Anderson, since 2003. In 2016 Barbara Young, Baroness Young of Old Scone became the charity&#x27;s chair.

===Funding===
The Woodland Trust receives funding from a wide range of sources including membership, legacies, donations and appeals, corporate supporters, grants and charitable trusts including lottery funding, other organisations and landfill tax.

==Function==
The Woodland Trust uses its experience and authority in conservation to influence others who are in a position to improve the future of native woodland. This includes government, other landowners, and like-minded organisations. It also campaigns to protect and save ancient woodland from destructive development. Its projects also include the Nature Detectives youth programme, a project for schools learning about the seasonal effect on woodlands – phenology – and the Ancient Tree Hunt campaign.

===Woodland protection===
It looks after more than 1,000 woods and groups of woods covering . Nearly 350 of its sites contain ancient woodland of which 70 per cent is semi-natural ancient woodland – land which has been under tree cover since at least 1600. It also manages over 110 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. There are currently over 600 ancient woods under threat across the UK.

===Woodland creation===
The trust has also created new woodlands: over have been created, including 250 new community woods in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Its largest current projects include the Glen Finglas Estate in the Trossachs, Scotland and the Heartwood Forest near St Albans, Hertfordshire, England, which will cover approximately . It owns 20 sites covering in the National Forest and has twelve sites in Community Forests in England.

The Woodland Trust also provides free trees to communities or places of education in order to facilitate the creation of new woodland.

=== Completed projects ===

====Millennium woods====
The Woodland Trust&#x27;s Woods on Your Doorstep project created 250 &quot;Millennium woods&quot; to celebrate the millennium.

==== Trafalgar Woods ====
As part of the trust&#x27;s &#x27;Tree For All&#x27; campaign, new woods were planted to mark the 2005 anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, notably Victory Wood in Kent.

====Jubilee Woods====

The Trust ran the Jubilee Woods project, which aimed to plant 6 million trees and create 60 commemorative &#x27;Diamond&#x27; woods across the UK as part of Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. The largest of these, owned and managed by the Trust itself, is the Flagship Diamond Wood within the National Forest in Leicestershire, which will be planted with 300,000 trees.

==== First World War Centenary Woods ====
Beginning in 2014, a project commemorating the First World War involved tree planting and the establishment of new woodland sites across the UK. The planned sites were Langley Vale Wood (England), Dreghorn Woods (Scotland), Coed Ffos Las (Wales), and Brackfield Wood (Northern Ireland).

As part of the project, the Woodland Trust entered a partnership with the National Football Museum to create team groves to commemorate all the professional football players involved in the First World War, giving supporters the chance to dedicate trees at the English Centenary Wood, Langley Vale in Epsom.

=== Ongoing initiatives ===

==== Nature&#x27;s Calendar ====
This citizen science project encourages members of the public to record the signs of the seasons near to them in order to show and assess the impact of climate change on the UK&#x27;s wildlife. Thousands of volunteers send in their sightings, providing evidence about how wildlife is responding to the changing climate.

The Trust&#x27;s records date back to 1736, making it the longest written biological record of its kind. It has become a powerful tool in assessing the impact of climate change and is valued by research scientists.

====Ancient Tree Inventory====
The Ancient Tree Inventory is a project run by the Woodland Trust in partnership with the Tree Register and the Ancient Tree Forum, which aims to record ancient, veteran and notable trees in the United Kingdom. , over 180,000 trees have been recorded by members of the public on the project&#x27;s website, which provides a map of the trees.

<text>The rhinovirus (from the &quot;nose&quot;, , &quot;of the nose&quot;, and the ) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus &quot;Enterovirus&quot; in the family &quot;Picornaviridae&quot;. Rhinovirus is the most common viral infectious agent in humans and is the predominant cause of the common cold.

The three species of rhinovirus (A, B, and C) include at least 165 recognized types that differ according to their surface antigens or genetics. They are among the smallest viruses, with diameters of about 30 nanometers. By comparison, other viruses, such as smallpox and vaccinia, are around ten times larger at about 300 nanometers, while influenza viruses are around 80–120 nm.

Rhinoviruses are transmitted through aerosols, respiratory droplets, fomites, and direct person-to-person contact. They primarily infect nasal epithelial cells in the airway and cause mild symptoms such as sore throat, cough, and nasal congestion. However, rhinovirus infection can cause more severe disease in infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Rhinoviruses are also recognized as a major cause of asthma exacerbations.

As of April 2024, there are no FDA-approved vaccines or antiviral treatments for rhinovirus infection.

In 1953, when a cluster of nurses developed a mild respiratory illness, Winston Price, from Johns Hopkins University, took nasal passage samples and isolated the first rhinovirus, which he called the JH virus, named after Johns Hopkins. His findings were published in 1956.

In 2006, advancements in molecular testing techniques for identifying rhinoviruses in clinical specimens led to the discovery of rhinovirus C species in samples from Queensland, Australia and New York City, United States. The ICTV formally designated RV-C as a separate species in 2009.

== Transmission ==
Rhinoviruses may be spread via airborne aerosols, respiratory droplets and from fomites (contaminated surfaces), including direct person-to-person contact. Rhinoviruses can survive on surfaces such as stainless steel or plastic for several hours. 
Airborne precautions are likely effective in reducing transmission, while other precautions such as hand-washing or cleaning surfaces with disinfectants are known effective in preventing rhinovirus transmission.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Rhinoviruses are the primary cause of the common cold. Symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing and cough; sometimes accompanied by muscle aches, fatigue, malaise, headache, muscle weakness, or loss of appetite. Fever and extreme exhaustion are less common in rhinovirus infection compared to influenza.

== Epidemiology ==
Rhinoviruses can be detected year-round; however, the incidence of rhinovirus is higher in the autumn and winter, with most infections occurring between September and April in the northern hemisphere. The seasonality may be due to the start of the school year and to people spending more time indoors thereby increasing the chance of transmission of the virus. Lower ambient temperatures, especially outdoors, may also be a factor given that rhinoviruses preferentially replicate at 33 °C (91.4 °F) as opposed to 37 °C (98.6 °F). Other climate factors such as humidity may influence rhinovirus seasonality. Young children (&lt;5 years old) experience a high rate of infection which can be detected in community surveillance studies of children up to 34% of the year.

Those most affected by rhinoviruses are infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.

== Pathogenesis ==
The primary route of entry for human rhinoviruses is the upper respiratory tract (mouth and nose). Rhinovirus A and B use &quot;major&quot; ICAM-1 (Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule 1), also known as CD54 (Cluster of Differentiation 54), on respiratory epithelial cells, as receptors to bind to. Some subgroups under A and B uses the &quot;minor&quot; LDL receptor instead. Rhinovirus C uses cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) to mediate cellular entry. As the virus replicates and spreads, infected cells release distress signals known as chemokines and cytokines (which in turn activate inflammatory mediators).

Infection occurs rapidly, with the virus adhering to surface receptors within 15 minutes of entering the respiratory tract. Just over 50% of individuals will experience symptoms within 2 days of infection. Only about 5% of cases will have an incubation period of less than 20 hours, and, at the other extreme, it is expected that 5% of cases would have an incubation period of greater than four and a half days.

Human rhinoviruses preferentially grow at 33 °C (91.4 °F), notably colder than the average human body temperature of 37 °C (98.6 °F), hence the virus&#x27;s tendency to infect the upper respiratory tract, where respiratory airflow is in continual contact with the (colder) extrasomatic environment.

Rhinovirus A and C species viruses are more strongly associated with significant illness and wheezing, while rhinovirus B species are more commonly mild or asymptomatic.

== Taxonomy ==

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) defines rhinoviruses as three species within the genus &quot;Enterovirus:&quot;

* &quot;Enterovirus alpharhino&quot; (Rhinovirus A)

* &quot;Enterovirus betarhino&quot; (Rhinovirus B)
* &quot;Enterovirus cerhino&quot; (Rhinovirus C)

===Types===
Prior to 2020, enteroviruses (including all rhinoviruses) were categorized according to their serotype. In 2020 the ICTV ratified a proposal to classify all new types based on the genetic diversity of their VP1 gene.
Human rhinovirus type names are of the form RV-&quot;Xn&quot; where &quot;X&quot; is the rhinovirus species (A, B, or C) and &quot;n&quot; is an index number. Species A and B have used the same index up to number 100, while species C has always used a separate index. Valid index numbers are as follows:
* Rhinovirus A: 1, 1B, 2, 7–13, 15, 16, 18–25, 28–34, 36, 38–41, 43–47, 49–51, 53–68, 71, 73–78, 80–82, 85, 88–90, 94–96, 100–108
* Rhinovirus B: 3–6, 14, 17, 26, 27, 35, 37, 42, 48, 52, 69, 70, 72, 79, 83, 84, 86, 91–93, 97, 99, 100-104
* Rhinovirus C: 1–57

== Structure ==

Rhinoviruses have single-stranded positive sense RNA genomes of between 7200 and 8500 nucleotides in length. At the 5&#x27; end of the genome is a virus-encoded protein and, as in mammalian mRNA, there is a 3&#x27; poly-A tail. Structural proteins are encoded in the 5&#x27; region of the genome and non structural at the 3&#x27; end. This is the same for all picornaviruses. The viral particles themselves are not enveloped and are dodecahedral in structure.

The viral proteins are translated as a single long polypeptide, which is cleaved into the structural and nonstructural viral proteins.

The structure of the virus was determined in 1985 using x-ray crystallography by researchers at Purdue University and the University of Wisconsin led by Michael Rossmann. The virus was crystallized forming cubic crystals with four virus particles in each unit cell (space group &quot;P&quot;23, no. 198), similar to a cubic close-packed arrangement.

Human rhinoviruses are composed of a capsid that contains four viral proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. VP1, VP2, and VP3 form the major part of the protein capsid. The much smaller VP4 protein has a more extended structure, and lies at the interface between the capsid and the RNA genome. There are 60 copies of each of these proteins assembled as an icosahedron. Antibodies are a major defense against infection with the epitopes lying on the exterior regions of VP1-VP3.

== Novel antiviral drugs ==
There are currently no FDA-approved antiviral drugs to treat rhinovirus infections. Several novel antiviral compounds have been tested in clinical trials without sufficient efficacy to progress to FDA approval. Compounds specifically targeted for rhinoviruses, or more broadly, picornaviruses, include the following:

* Rupintrivir is a peptidomimetic drug developed for treatment of rhinovirus infections. Rupintrivir inhibits human rhinovirus 3Cprotease and prevents cleavage of the rhinovirus polyprotein following translation, therefore preventing viral assembly and replication. A phase II clinical trial of rupintrivir using experimentally induced rhinovirus infection in healthy volunteers demonstrated efficacy in reducing viral load and symptom severity. However, further trials testing rupintrivir in treating natural infections showed minimal benefit, and further clinical development was halted.
* Pleconaril is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug developed for the treatment of infections caused by picornaviruses. This drug acts by binding to a hydrophobic pocket in VP1, and stabilizes the protein capsid to such an extent that the virus cannot release its RNA genome into the target cell. Phase III clinical trials showed a slight reduction in symptom duration if taken within 24 hours of symptom onset. However, the FDA denied approval of pleconaril due to concerns about side effects, limited efficacy in non-white participants, and difficulty in treating most patients within a 24 hour window.

Other treatments aiming to reduce rhinovirus infection symptoms include immunomodulatory agents. These may promote beneficial antiviral responses or reduce inflammatory responses associated with symptoms. Interferon-alpha used intranasally was shown to be effective against human rhinovirus infections. However, volunteers treated with this drug experienced some side effects, such as nasal bleeding and began developing tolerance to the drug. Subsequently, research into the treatment was abandoned. Inhaled budesonide has been shown to reduce viral load and pro-inflammatory IL-1β in mice. Omalizumab, which was developed for treatment of severe allergic asthma, has shown evidence in reducing symptom severity of asthma patients infected with rhinovirus.

== Vaccine development ==
There are no vaccines against these viruses as there is little-to-no cross-protection between serotypes. At least 165 types of human rhinoviruses are known. However, a study of the VP4 protein has shown it to be highly conserved among many serotypes of human rhinovirus, opening up the potential for a future pan-serotype human rhinovirus vaccine. A similar result was obtained with the VP1 protein. Like VP4, VP1 also occasionally &quot;pokes&quot; out of the viral particle, making it available to neutralizing antibodies. Both peptides have been tested on rabbits, resulting in successful generation of cross-serotype antibodies.

Rhinovirus genome has a high rate of variability in human circulation, even occurring with genomic sequences that differ up to 30%. Recent studies have identified conserved regions of the rhinovirus genome; this, along with an adjuvanted polyvalent rhinovirus vaccine, shows potential for future development in vaccine treatment.

== Prevention ==

Human rhinovirus can remain infectious for up to three hours outside of a human host. Once the virus is contracted, a person is most contagious within the first three days. Preventative measures such as regular vigorous handwashing with soap and water may aid in avoiding infection. Avoiding touching the mouth, eyes, and nose (the most common entry points for rhinovirus) may also assist prevention. Droplet precautions, which take the form of a surgical mask and gloves, are the method used in major hospitals. As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing, talking, and even singing. In order to prevent airborne transmission, droplet precautions are insufficient, and routine airborne precautions are necessary.

<doc id="104101" wikidata="Q2634018" url="?curid=104101" title="Mr. Denton on Doomsday">
<text>&quot;Mr. Denton on Doomsday&quot; is episode three of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on October 16, 1959, on CBS. It was the first &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode to be rerun.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Al Denton was once known as the quickest draw in town, but riddled with increasing guilt over the losers in his gun duels (one of whom was a teenage boy), he became an alcoholic wreck and the laughing stock of the community. A mysterious salesman named Henry J. Fate causes Denton to inexplicably regain his expert shooting touch and once again inspire the respect and awe of the townsfolk; Denton explains to Liz, a saloon girl, that this will only cause reputation-hungry gunslingers from miles around to seek him out and, inevitably, kill him. He cleans himself up and goes sober but only, he says, so as to die with dignity. Just as Denton predicted, soon enough a challenge is delivered which Denton dares not refuse.

The still-weary and not-so-sure-handed Denton practices in the desert for his suicidal duel, but he misses his targets miserably and concludes that he must skip town. As he packs his things and tries to flee under the cover of night, he strikes up a conversation with Fate, who seems to know things about Denton and offers him a way out. Fate offers him a potion guaranteed to make the drinker the fastest gun in the West for exactly ten seconds. Denton is skeptical but Fate goads him into drinking a free sample, after which Denton immediately realizes its benefits.

At the appointed time, Denton faces his challenger, Pete Grant, a brash young gunfighter. Denton downs his potion only to find his opponent holding an identical empty bottle. Grant and Denton both realize that Fate tricked them, but it is too late to back out of the duel. Each man shoots the other in the hand, causing injuries which are minor but forever ruin both men&#x27;s ability to pull a trigger.

Denton tells his young opponent that they have both been blessed because they will never again be able to fire a gun in anger. He tells Liz that Grant is lucky because he was given this lesson early. Henry J. Fate tips his hat to Denton and rides quietly out of town.

==Closing narration==
==Preview for next week&#x27;s story==
==Episode notes==
In his 1959 promotional film shown to potential sponsors, Rod Serling summarized an earlier version of this episode&#x27;s plot under its original title, &quot;Death, Destry, and Mr. Dingle&quot;. As told by Serling, the basic premise is similar, but the earlier version seems to have been more comedic in tone, involving a meek schoolteacher who quite unintentionally gains notoriety as a top gunslinger. The name &quot;Mr. Dingle&quot; (originally intended for the Dan Duryea character) would be used by Serling for a future episode, with Burgess Meredith playing the eponymous character in &quot;Mr. Dingle, the Strong&quot; in 1961. The harmonica in the background is playing the Russian folksong &quot;Stenka Razin&quot; (the melody of which was later adapted for the 1965 hit &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; by The Seekers).

Al Denton&#x27;s speech to Liz Smith, in which he describes having been a top gunfighter until he turned to drink after being &quot;called out&quot; by a 16-year-old boy, was parodied in the Mel Brooks comedy &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. In that film, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) had also been a top gunfighter until he was challenged (and shot) by a six-year-old child, leading him to become an alcoholic.

Martin Landau, playing here the sadistic bully to the story&#x27;s protagonist, Al Denton, would return to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; five years later in “The Jeopardy Room”; this time he is the sadistically treated victim - a KGB major longing to defect but targeted for assassination.

<doc id="104102" wikidata="Q2631660" url="?curid=104102" title="The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine">
<text>&quot;The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine&quot;, starring Ida Lupino, is episode four of the American television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on October 23, 1959, on CBS. The title is a reference to 16 mm film.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Aging film star Barbara Jean Trenton secludes herself in her private screening room, where she reminisces about her past by watching her old films from the 1930s. In an attempt to bring her out into the real world, her agent Danny Weiss arranges a part for her in a new movie. Barbara and the man who runs the studio, Marty Sall, however, have historically had a contentious relationship; he is rather petty, small, and callous. He offers her the role of a mother, which she refuses, to which Marty then insults her, telling her she&#x27;s living in the past and that any role she would receive would be charity. Barbara leaves in anger. When Barbara returns home, she and Danny get into an argument when she decides to throw a party for her show-business friends. Danny points out that all of those friends have either moved away or have died, and that she keeps wishing for things that are dead.

After the argument, Barbara has, according to her maid, chosen to stay in the screening room day and night. Danny decides to bring a former leading man—now also older, Jerry Herndon, many years retired from acting and managing a chain of grocery stores—to visit her. She is horrified by her friend&#x27;s aged appearance and orders them both to leave. After the ill-fated visit, Barbara goes back into the projector room and puts on a movie that features Jerry&#x27;s younger self. She will not accept that the present-day Jerry is the real one and voices her wish repeatedly to join the one on the screen; the screen blurs accordingly.

Barbara&#x27;s maid comes with a snack and coffee, only to find the room empty—and is horrified by what she sees on the screen. She calls Danny and, when he comes over, tells him that—to her mind—Barbara has vanished from the house. He runs the projector and sees, in the movie, the front hall of the house filled with movie stars, looking as they did in the old films. Barbara descends the stairs, welcomes them to the party and says that dinner will be by the pool. As she starts off with Jerry, Danny tries to call her back to 1959 and reality. In response, she blows a kiss, throws her scarf toward the camera, and departs. The film ends. In the actual front hall, Danny finds Barbara&#x27;s scarf. &quot;To wishes, Barbie&quot;, he says wistfully. &quot;To the ones that come true.&quot;

==Episode notes==
This episode contains several similarities to Billy Wilder&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; starring Gloria Swanson and shares the same composer and conductor of music, Franz Waxman. Mitchell Leisen directed Billy Wilder scripts at Paramount in the 1930s. It also evokes 1952&#x27;s &quot;The Star&quot; with Bette Davis which was directed by Stuart Heisler and released by Twentieth Century Fox.

Ida Lupino later directed the season five episode &quot;The Masks&quot;. She was both the only person to have acted in one episode and directed another, and the only woman to direct a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode.

Martin Balsam starred in the de facto pilot for &quot;Twilight Zone,&quot; The Time Element (broadcast as part of Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse) and returned to star in the season four episode &quot;The New Exhibit&quot;. Between his two episodes of &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, Balsam appeared in three iconic films of the era: &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Cape Fear&quot;.

<doc id="104103" wikidata="Q2744666" url="?curid=104103" title="Walking Distance">
<text>&quot;Walking Distance&quot; is episode five of the American television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on October 30, 1959. The episode was listed as the ninth best episode in the history of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Opening narration==
Martin Sloan, age thirty-six. Occupation: vice-president, ad agency, in charge of media. This is not just a Sunday drive for Martin Sloan. He perhaps doesn&#x27;t know it at the time, but it&#x27;s an exodus. Somewhere up the road he&#x27;s looking for sanity. And somewhere up the road, he&#x27;ll find something else.

==Plot==
While driving his car in the countryside on a summer afternoon circa 1959, 36-year-old New York advertising executive Martin Sloan stops to have his car serviced at a gas station within walking distance of Homewood, his hometown. After walking into town, he sees that it apparently has not changed since he was a boy. He visits the drugstore, and he is confused when he finds out that ice cream sodas are still only 10 cents.

Martin walks to the town park, where he is startled to see himself as a young boy, carving his name into the bandstand, exactly as he remembers doing. Martin approaches, resulting in preteen Martin becoming scared, believing himself to be in trouble, and he runs away. Following his younger self home, he meets his parents as they were in his childhood, but he is turned away. He sees the next door neighbor, a teen boy working on his brand new roadster; Martin soon discovers that it is the year 1934.

A man can think a lot of thoughts and walk a lot of pavements between afternoon and night. And to a man like Martin Sloan, to whom memory has suddenly become reality, a resolve can come just as clearly and inexorably as stars in the summer night. Martin Sloan is now back in time. And his resolve is to put in a claim to the past.

Confused and worried, Martin wanders around town and ends up at his former home again later that evening, where he again tries to convince his parents who he is by showing his identification, but he is slapped by his mother and rejected.

Martin wanders back to the park and finds his preteen self on a carousel. His advances again frighten young Martin, who falls off the merry-go-round and injures his leg. Simultaneously, adult Martin experiences excruciating pain in his leg due to the effect of the injury propagating through time to his adult self. The carousel is stopped, and Martin tries to tell his younger self to enjoy his boyhood while it lasts.

After 11-year-old Martin is carried away, adult Martin, sitting dejectedly on the carousel, is joined by his father who tells him young Martin will be all right, but will have a limp. He also tells him that having seen money with future dates and adult Martin&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license (with a 1960 expiration date) from Martin&#x27;s wallet, which he had dropped at the house during the confrontation earlier, he now believes Martin&#x27;s story. Martin&#x27;s father advises his son that everyone has his time and that instead of looking behind him, he should look ahead; as delightful and rewarding as he may remember childhood to be, adulthood holds its own delights and rewards.

When Martin walks back into the drugstore, he finds himself back in 1959, where ice cream sodas are now 35 cents. He discovers that he now has a limp from the carousel injury. Martin makes his way back to the gas station where he picks up his car. He drives away, content for once to live his life in his own age group.

==Closing narration==
Martin Sloan, age thirty-six, vice-president in charge of media. Successful in most things but not in the one effort that all men try at some time in their lives—trying to go home again. And also like all men, perhaps there&#x27;ll be an occasion, maybe a summer night sometime, when he&#x27;ll look up from what he&#x27;s doing and listen to the distant music of a calliope, and hear the voices and the laughter of the people and the places of his past. And perhaps across his mind there&#x27;ll flit a little errant wish, that a man might not have to become old, never outgrow the parks and the merry-go-rounds of his youth. And he&#x27;ll smile then too, because he&#x27;ll know it &quot;is&quot; just an errant wish, some wisp of memory not too important really, some laughing ghosts that cross a man&#x27;s mind, that are a part of the Twilight Zone.

==Production==
Unlike some episodes of the show that were accompanied by pre-composed stock music cues, &quot;Walking Distance&quot; was underscored with music specially written for it. As for other &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes, Bernard Herrmann—also composer of the first season&#x27;s main title music and some of its stock music—wrote the music for this one. The intimate score has an isolated running time of about 19 minutes, and it is played by a 19-piece-orchestra consisting of strings (violins, violas, cellos, basses) and one harp.

The park in this episode is said to be inspired by Recreation Park in Binghamton, New York, which is located about five blocks away from Rod Serling&#x27;s childhood home. Like the park in &quot;Walking Distance&quot;, Recreation Park has a carousel and a bandstand. There is a plaque in the Recreation Park bandstand commemorating the episode. The plaque and the episode are referenced heavily in the 2014 film &quot;The Rewrite&quot;, which is mostly set in Binghamton.

==Themes==
Similar themes of nostalgia, its potential risks, the relentless pressures of the business world, and the disillusionments that come with being an adult are explored in &quot;A Stop at Willoughby&quot;, &quot;Young Man&#x27;s Fancy&quot;, &quot;The Incredible World of Horace Ford&quot;, &quot;Of Late I Think of Cliffordville&quot;, and to a lesser extent, &quot;The Brain Center at Whipple&#x27;s&quot;, as well as two Serling teleplays from before and after &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;: The &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; episode &quot;Patterns&quot; and the &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode &quot;They&#x27;re Tearing Down Tim Riley&#x27;s Bar&quot;.

==Critical response==
&quot;Walking Distance&quot; has continued to be one of the more popular and critically acclaimed of all &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes. Paul Mandell of &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; wrote: &quot;[Walking Distance] was the most personal story Serling ever wrote, and easily the most sensitive dramatic fantasy in the history of television.&quot; The episode was listed as the ninth best episode in the history of the series by &quot;Time&quot; in celebration of the series&#x27; 50th anniversary.

In an audio recording of an early 1970s lecture at Ithaca College included in &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; DVD packages, Serling was critical toward the episode, feeling in retrospect that his relative inexperience as a writer at the time was apparent in the screenplay. However, Jodi Serling said in a 2019 interview with SyFy Wire that &quot;Walking Distance&quot; was her father&#x27;s favorite episode of the show because it was &quot;a very personal story for him&quot; and there were &quot;pieces of him in it&quot;. Serling stated it was her favorite episode as well due to her father&#x27;s connection to it, saying: &quot;My father every summer would take a ride from our place on Cayuga Lake, which is in Ithaca, New York, and he would ride an hour to Binghamton, New York, and revisit his hometown. It was like his private journey of seeing his old house. It&#x27;s still there on Bennett Ave., going on the merry-go-round — which isn&#x27;t the same merry-go-round — and walking the streets as he did when he played marbles with his friends. That episode is so nostalgic [for me] because it&#x27;s so much about my dad. I can&#x27;t help but see him.&quot;

==Soundtrack releases==
Due to the high popularity of the episode and the music, the score has received several releases on CD in its original film version in monoaural sound and two re-recordings in stereo as well, one done by Joel McNeely with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (the only complete version) and the other by William T. Stromberg conducting the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. Orchestrator John Morgan enlarged all sections of the orchestra for the latter, referring to Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; as Herrmann&#x27;s main influence on the score in the liner notes. Composer/pianist Tom Alexander included the piece &quot;Excerpts from Walking Distance&quot; on his 2016 solo piano album &quot;Overbrook Avenue&quot;.

<text>&quot;Escape Clause&quot; is episode six of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It is &quot;the story of a strange contract between a mortal man and his most satanic majesty&quot;; it originally aired on November 6, 1959, on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Walter Bedeker, a paranoid and self-absorbed hypochondriac, is convinced his wife Ethel and his doctor (who insists Bedeker is in good health) are conspiring to kill him by purposely making him sick. After they leave, a large rotund man calling himself Cadwallader appears in Bedeker&#x27;s room, offering him immortality and a near-total halt to his physical aging. Bedeker guesses Cadwallader&#x27;s true identity (the Devil) but is unafraid. He haggles with Cadwallader, who admits he wants Bedeker&#x27;s soul and accurately points out the other will never miss it or notice when it&#x27;s gone.

Cadwallader inserts an escape clause allowing Bedeker to summon him at any time if he chooses to die. Bedeker is suspicious but after Cadwallader leaves, he tests his new power by placing his hands on a hot radiator and finding them uninjured, then throws all his medicines out of a window, to Ethel&#x27;s surprise.

Bedeker uses his newfound invulnerability to commit insurance fraud, claiming false settlements, and garnering cheap thrills by hurling himself into life-threatening accidents. After doing so 14 times, he concludes that the absence of risk and fear has made his life a dreadful bore. He purposely mixes a concoction of poisonous household liquids and drinks it, shocking Ethel, but it has no effect on him at all. Bedeker explains his situation to Ethel, admonishing her that if she had any imagination, she would find some way for him to experience some excitement. Proclaiming he is going to jump down the lightwell of their apartment building, Ethel futilely tries to stop him, tragically falling to her own demise.

Bedeker calmly calls the police, confessing to murdering Ethel. He is arrested and brought to trial. He hopes to experience the electric chair. However, due to his lawyer&#x27;s defense strategy, he is instead sentenced to life in prison without parole. Cadwallader appears in Bedeker&#x27;s jail cell to remind him of the escape clause. Realizing he will face eternity in prison if he does not use it, Bedeker nods and immediately suffers a fatal heart attack. The guard discovers his lifeless body and sighs, &quot;Poor devil … .&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Escape Clause&quot; was one of the three episodes-in-production mentioned by Rod Serling in his 1959 promotional film pitching the series to potential sponsors, the others being &quot;The Lonely&quot; and &quot;Mr. Denton on Doomsday&quot; (referred to as &quot;Death, Destry, and Mr. Dingle&quot;).

==Impact==
&quot;Here was a little gem. Good work, Rod Serling. This little piece about a hypochondriac who gets tangled up with an obese, clerical devil ranked with the best that has ever been accomplished in half-hour filmed television.&quot; —&quot;Excerpt from the Daily Variety review.&quot;

Disney&#x27;s Twilight Zone Tower of Terror has a reference to this episode located in the basement of the attraction. The elevators have a certificate of inspection plaque, signed by &quot;Cadwallader&quot;, bearing the inspection number &quot;10259&quot;. These numbers represent October 2, 1959, the date &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; first aired.

<text>&quot;The Lonely&quot; is the seventh episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on November 13, 1959, on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In the space age, an inmate named Corry, convicted of murder, is sentenced to fifty years&#x27; solitary confinement on a distant asteroid. On the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the fourth year of incarceration, he is visited by the spacecraft (flown by a Captain Allenby) that brings him supplies and news from Earth four times a year. While Corry expects that perhaps he and Allenby will have time to play cards or chess, the captain informs the inmate that the ship and crew can stay only fifteen minutes this time; the asteroid&#x27;s orbit is such that they would otherwise be stuck fourteen days at least, awaiting favorable orbital conditions to depart. Allenby&#x27;s crew resent being away from Earth because of the likes of Corry.

Allenby has been trying to make Corry&#x27;s stay humanely tolerable by bringing him things to take his mind off the loneliness, like the components to build an old car. He believes Corry that the killing was in self-defense and sympathizes with him. On this particular trip, the transport crew delights in bringing news that Corry&#x27;s pardon was rejected and that murder cases are not even being reviewed. This causes Corry to feel that there is no way he is going to last out the years and the loneliness. Before leaving, Allenby orders his men to fetch a large crate which the captain instructs Corry to not open until the transport crew is out of sight—they have no clue what is inside the box.

Upon opening this special container, Corry discovers that Allenby has left him with a gynoid named Alicia to keep him company. Alicia is capable of emotions and memory and has a lifespan comparable to a human. At first, Corry detests her, rejecting her as a mere machine; synthetic skin and wires only capable of mocking him. However, when Corry hurts Alicia and sees that she is in fact capable of crying, he realizes that she has feelings. Over the next eleven months, Corry begins to fall in love with her. Alicia develops a personality that mirrors Corry&#x27;s, and the days become bearable.

When the ship returns, Captain Allenby brings news that the murder cases have been reviewed and Corry has been pardoned. He can return home to earth immediately but they only have twenty minutes before they must leave; the crew has been dodging meteors and are nearly out of fuel. Corry learns that, because there are seven other passengers from other asteroids on the ship, there is only room for him and fifteen pounds of luggage. He is initially unconcerned as he doesn&#x27;t have fifteen pounds&#x27; worth of possessions that he cares about; then he realizes that Allenby does not consider Alicia human. The fifteen-pound limit is far too small to accommodate her. He frantically tries to find some way to take Alicia with him, arguing that she is not a robot, but a woman, and insisting that Allenby simply does not know Alicia as he does. At that point, just as the transport crew is surprised at the sight of Alicia, the captain suddenly draws his gun and shoots her in the face. The robot breaks down, malfunctioning, her face a mass of wire and broken circuitry which repeats the name &quot;Corry&quot;. Allenby then takes Corry back to the ship, assuring him he will only be leaving behind loneliness. &quot;I must remember that,&quot; Corry says tonelessly. &quot;I must remember to keep that in mind.&quot;

==Other media==
An audio adaptation of &quot;The Lonely&quot;, featuring Mike Starr as Corry, was produced for radio in the mid-2000s; it was released on CD by CBS Consumer Products in 2007 as part of &quot;The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas Vol. 4&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;The Lonely&quot; was produced for the stage by 4 Letter Entertainment.

==Production information==
&quot;The Lonely&quot; was the first regular episode to enter production following the success of the pilot episode, &quot;Where Is Everybody?&quot; in selling the series.

It was the first of several episodes (including &quot;I Shot an Arrow into the Air&quot;, &quot;A Hundred Yards Over the Rim&quot; and &quot;The Rip Van Winkle Caper&quot;) to be filmed on location in Death Valley. Unprepared for the terrible conditions they would face, the crew suffered extreme dehydration and heat exhaustion and director of photography George T. Clemens even collapsed, falling from a camera crane while filming continued.

For reasons unknown, Ted Knight is not listed in the episode credits.

<doc id="104108" wikidata="Q3198638" url="?curid=104108" title="Time Enough at Last">
<text>&quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; is the eighth episode of the American anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, first airing on November 20, 1959. The episode was adapted from a short story by Lynn Venable, which appeared in the January 1953 edition of &quot;If: Worlds of Science Fiction&quot;.

&quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; became one of the most famous episodes of the original &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. It is &quot;the story of a man who seeks salvation in the rubble of a ruined world.&quot; The man in question is Henry Bemis (), played by Burgess Meredith, who loves books but is surrounded by those who would prevent him from reading them. The episode follows Bemis through a post-apocalyptic world, touching on such social issues as anti-intellectualism, the dangers of reliance upon technology, and the distinction between solitude and loneliness.

==Opening narration==

==Plot==
Bank teller and avid bookworm Henry Bemis reads &quot;David Copperfield&quot; while serving a customer. He is so engrossed in the novel that he attempts to regale the increasingly annoyed woman with information about the characters, and shortchanges her. Bemis&#x27; angry boss, and later his nagging wife, both complain to him that he wastes far too much time reading &quot;doggerel&quot;. As a cruel joke, his wife asks him to read poetry to her from one of his books; he eagerly obliges, only to find that she has crossed out the text on every page. Seconds later, she destroys the book by ripping the pages from it.

The next day, as usual, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank&#x27;s vault, where his reading cannot be disturbed. Moments after he sees a newspaper headline, which reads &quot;H-Bomb Capable of Total Destruction&quot;, an enormous explosion outside shakes the vault, knocking Bemis unconscious. After regaining consciousness and recovering his thick glasses, Bemis emerges from the vault to find the bank demolished and everyone in it dead. Leaving the bank, he sees that the entire city has been destroyed, and realizes that, while a nuclear war has devastated Earth, him being in the vault has saved him.

Finding himself alone in the broken world with canned food to last him a lifetime and no means of leaving to look for other survivors, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to kill himself using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees the ruins of a public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and all the time he could ever hope for, to read them without interruption.

His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward to reading for years to come, with no obligations to get in the way. Just as he bends down to pick up a book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of his glasses and breaks down in tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.

==Closing narration==
==Preview for next week&#x27;s story==
==Production==

&quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; was one of the first episodes written for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It introduced Burgess Meredith to the series; he went on to star in three more episodes, being introduced as &quot;no stranger to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;&quot; in promotional spots for season two&#x27;s &quot;The Obsolete Man&quot;. He also narrated the 1983 film &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;, which made reference to &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; during its opening sequence, with the characters discussing the episode in detail.

Footage of the exterior steps of the library was filmed several months after production had been completed. These steps can also be seen on the exterior of an Eloi public building in MGM&#x27;s film of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960). John Brahm was nominated for a Directors Guild award for his work on the episode. The book that Bemis was reading in the vault and that flips open when the bomb explodes is &quot;A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus&quot; by Washington Irving.

==Themes==
Although the overriding message may seem to &quot;be careful what you wish for, you just might get it&quot;, there are other themes throughout the episode. Among these is the question of solitude versus loneliness, as embodied by Bemis&#x27; moment of near-suicide. Additionally, the portrayal of societal attitudes toward books speaks to the contemporary decline of traditional literature and how, given enough time, reading may become a relic of the past. At the same time, the ending &quot;punishes Bemis for his antisocial behavior, and his greatest desire is thwarted&quot;.

Rod Serling&#x27;s concluding statement in the episode alludes to Robert Burns&#x27; Scots language poem &quot;To a Mouse&quot;. The poem concludes: &quot;The best-laid schemes o&#x27; mice an men / &quot;Gang aft agley&quot;&quot; (translation: &quot;Often go awry&quot;). Meredith himself had portrayed George Milton in the 1939 film adaptation of the Steinbeck novel named for that same line.

Although &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; implies that nuclear warfare has destroyed humanity, film critic Andrew Sarris notes that the episode&#x27;s necessarily unrealistic format may have been what allowed its production to commence:

In the era of the Internet and eBooks, the irony depicted in &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; has an Information Age counterpart, according to Weston Ochse of &quot;Storytellers Unplugged&quot;. As Ochse points out, when Bemis becomes the last person on Earth, he finally has time to read, with all his books at his fingertips and the only impediment is technology when his medium for accessing them—his glasses—breaks. In a hypothetical world where all books are published electronically, Ochse observes, readers would be &quot;only a lightning strike, a faulty switch, a sleepy workman or a natural disaster away from becoming Henry Bemis at the end of the world&quot;—that is, a power outage has the potential to give them time to read, yet like Bemis, they too would lose their medium for accessing their books—namely the computer.

===Similar episodes===
&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; often explored similar themes throughout its run. &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; has strong thematic ties to a number of other episodes in the series, starting with that of isolation, first explored in the series pilot, &quot;Where Is Everybody?&quot; It is also a prominent theme in the previous episode &quot;The Lonely&quot;. Additionally, in a plot very similar to that of &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot;, &quot;The Mind and the Matter&quot; tells of a man who uses his mind to erase humanity, only to find that existence without other people is unbearable. The notion of being an outsider, lost in a sea of conformity, was one of the most common themes of the series.

Other thematic elements in this episode can be found throughout the series, as well. &quot;The Obsolete Man&quot; takes the episode&#x27;s literary subtext—the notion that reading may eventually be considered &quot;obsolete&quot;—to an extreme: The state has declared books obsolete and a librarian (also played by Meredith) finds himself on trial for his own obsolescence. This notion, akin to Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story &quot;The Pedestrian&quot; (1951), is also alluded to in the episode &quot;Number 12 Looks Just Like You&quot;, in which a perfect and equal world considers works like those of Shakespeare &quot;smut&quot;.

==Impact==

===Critical and fan favorite===
&quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; was a ratings success in its initial airing and &quot;became an instant classic&quot;. It &quot;remains one of the best-remembered and best-loved episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;&quot; according to Marc Zicree, author of &quot;The Twilight Zone Companion&quot;, as well as one of the most frequently parodied. When a poll asked readers of &quot;Twilight Zone Magazine&quot; which episode of the series they remembered the most, &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; was the most frequent response, with &quot;To Serve Man&quot; coming in a distant second. In TV Land&#x27;s presentation of &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Memorable Moments in Television&quot;, &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; was ranked at No. 25. 
In an interview, Serling cited &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; as one of his two favorites from the entire series. (The other was &quot;The Invaders&quot;, with Agnes Moorehead.)

The episode has been referenced many times in popular culture. For example, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, a theme park ride at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and formerly Disney California Adventure Park, displays a replica of Henry Bemis&#x27; broken glasses in the lobby. It is noted that, while they are indeed reading glasses, Burgess Meredith wears them the entire episode to make Bemis look more bookish. On one appearance of the TV show &quot;Futurama&#x27;s&quot; show-within-a-show &quot;The Scary Door&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, a man like Bemis is presented in a library as &quot;the last man on earth&quot;. After he loses his glasses, the show pokes fun on the fact that he can still read books with large print and even in braille, so he successively loses various body parts until the scene ends. The PC game &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot; (2001) includes a librarian in a desolate world who wants the player to find his missing glasses so he can read his books. 
In a 2022 expansion for the game &quot;Fallout 76&quot; entitled “the Pitt”, players may come across a small room featuring a pair of glasses, a gun, and a note called “Time Enough at Last”, containing lines of dialogue from the character of Bemis.
In an episode of Modern Family, Jay&#x27;s glasses are sat on by Luke, breaking them. As he picks up his book, the shattered pieces of his glasses fall out. &quot;It&#x27;s not fair. It&#x27;s not fair&quot; he sarcastically utters.

Edward Hall seeks the aid of psychiatrist Dr. Eliot Rathmann. When he first enters the doctor&#x27;s office, so tired he is barely able to stand, Rathmann helps him to the couch. Hall begins to drift into sleep, but suddenly jolts awake and gets up. When pressed by Rathmann, he explains he has a heart condition, and also believes that his overactive imagination is severely out of control, to the point where he&#x27;s been able to see and feel something that is not there. Due to this, his heart condition is especially dangerous. He also explains that, when he has allowed himself to sleep he has been dreaming in chapters, as if in a movie serial. In his dreams, Maya &quot;The Cat Girl&quot;, a carnival dancer, lures him first into a funhouse and later onto a roller coaster in an attempt to frighten him.

He is now convinced that if he falls asleep, he&#x27;ll die. On the other hand, keeping himself awake will put too much of a strain on his heart. Feeling that Rathmann cannot help him, Hall starts to leave, but stops when he sees that Rathmann&#x27;s receptionist looks exactly like Maya. Terrified, he runs back into Rathmann&#x27;s office and jumps out the window to his death.

In reality, the doctor calls his receptionist into his office, where Hall lies on the couch, his eyes closed. Rathmann tells the receptionist that Hall came in, laid down, immediately fell asleep, and then a few moments later let out a scream and died. &quot;Well, I guess there are worse ways to go,&quot; the doctor says philosophically. &quot;At least he died peacefully...&quot;

==Episode notes==
*This was the first episode aired that was written by Charles Beaumont (and also the first that was not written by Rod Serling).
*&quot;Throughout the TV filming, Florey strove for quality. It might have been the most expensive MGM feature. He rooted out the meanings of certain lines, frequently surprising me with symbols and shadings I&#x27;d neither planned nor suspected. The set was truly impressionistic, recalling the days of &quot;Caligari&quot; and &quot;Liliom&quot;. The costumes were generally perfect. And in the starring role, Richard Conte gave a performance which displays both intensity and subtlety.&quot; ―Charles Beaumont writing in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, December 1959.
*This is one of several episodes from season one to have its opening title sequence plastered over with the opening for season two. This was done during the Summer of 1961 in order to give the re-running episodes of season one the new look that the show would take in the upcoming second season.

==Radio drama==
The episode was adapted for radio in 2002 featuring Fred Willard as Edward Hall. It was then released as part of &quot;The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas – Volume 9&quot; collection.

<doc id="104113" wikidata="Q952898" url="?curid=104113" title="G.711">
<text>G.711 is a narrowband audio codec originally designed for use in telephony that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s. It is an ITU-T standard (Recommendation) for audio encoding, titled Pulse code modulation (PCM) of voice frequencies released for use in 1972. 

G.711 passes audio signals in the frequency band of 300–3400 Hz and samples them at the rate of 8000 Hz, with the tolerance on that rate of 50 parts per million (ppm).

It uses one of two different logarithmic companding algorithms: μ-law, which is used primarily in North America and Japan, and A-law, which is in use in most other countries outside North America. Each companded sample is quantized as 8 bits, resulting in a 64 kbit/s bit rate. 

G.711 is a required standard in many technologies, such as in the H.320 and H.323 standards. It can also be used for fax communication over IP networks (as defined in T.38 specification). 

Two enhancements to G.711 have been published: G.711.0 utilizes lossless data compression to reduce the bandwidth usage and G.711.1 increases audio quality by increasing bandwidth.

==Features==
* 8 kHz sampling frequency
* 64 kbit/s bitrate (8 kHz sampling frequency × 8 bits per sample)
* Typical algorithmic delay is 0.125 ms, with no look-ahead delay
* G.711 is a waveform speech coder
* G.711 Appendix I defines a packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithm to help hide transmission losses in a packetized network
* G.711 Appendix II defines a discontinuous transmission (DTX) algorithm which uses voice activity detection (VAD) and comfort noise generation (CNG) to reduce bandwidth usage during silence periods
* PSQM testing under ideal conditions yields mean opinion scores of 4.45 for G.711 μ-law, 4.45 for G.711 A-law
* PSQM testing under network stress yields mean opinion scores of 4.13 for G.711 μ-law, 4.11 for G.711 A-law

==Types==
G.711 defines two main companding algorithms, the μ-law algorithm and A-law algorithm. Both are logarithmic, but A-law was specifically designed to be simpler for a computer to process. The standard also defines a sequence of repeating code values which defines the power level of 0 dB.

The μ-law and A-law algorithms encode 14-bit and 13-bit signed linear PCM samples (respectively) to logarithmic 8-bit samples. Thus, the G.711 encoder will create a 64 kbit/s bitstream for a signal sampled at 8 kHz.

G.711 μ-law tends to give more resolution to higher range signals while G.711 A-law provides more quantization levels at lower signal levels.

The terms &quot;PCMU&quot;, &quot;G711u&quot; and &quot;G711MU&quot; are also used for G.711 μ-law, and &quot;PCMA&quot; and &quot;G711A&quot; for G.711 A-law.

=== A-law ===

A-law encoding thus takes a 13-bit signed linear audio sample as input and converts it to an 8 bit value as follows:


Where is the sign bit, codice_1 is its inverse (i.e. positive values are encoded with MSB =  = 1), and bits marked are discarded. Note that the first column of the table uses different representation of negative values than the third column. So for example, input decimal value −21 is represented in binary after bit inversion as 1000000010100, which maps to 00001010 (according to the first row of the table). When decoding, this maps back to 1000000010101, which is interpreted as output value −21 in decimal. Input value +52 (0000000110100 in binary) maps to 10011010 (according to the second row), which maps back to 0000000110101 (+53 in decimal).

This can be seen as a floating-point number with 4 bits of mantissa (equivalent to a 5-bit precision), 3 bits of exponent and 1 sign bit , formatted as codice_2 with the decoded linear value given by formula
:formula_1
which is a 13-bit signed integer in the range ±1 to ±(2 − 2). Note that no compressed code decodes to zero due to the addition of 0.5 (half of a quantization step).

In addition, the standard specifies that all resulting even bits (LSB is even) are inverted before the octet is transmitted. This is to provide plenty of 0/1 transitions to facilitate the clock recovery process in the PCM receivers. Thus, a silent A-law encoded PCM channel has the 8 bit samples coded 0xD5 instead of 0x80 in the octets.

When data is sent over E0 (G.703), MSB (sign) is sent first and LSB is sent last.

ITU-T STL defines the algorithm for decoding as follows (it puts the decoded values in the 13 most significant bits of the 16-bit output data type).
void alaw_expand(lseg, logbuf, linbuf)
 long lseg;
 short *linbuf;
 short *logbuf;
 short ix, mant, iexp;
 long n;

 for (n = 0; n &lt; lseg; n++)
 ix = logbuf[n] ^ (0x0055); /* re-toggle toggled bits */

 ix &amp;= (0x007F); /* remove sign bit */
 iexp = ix » 4; /* extract exponent */
 mant = ix &amp; (0x000F); /* now get mantissa */
 if (iexp &gt; 0)
 mant = mant + 16; /* add leading &#x27;1&#x27;, if exponent &gt; 0 */

 mant = (mant « 4) + (0x0008); /* now mantissa left justified and */
 /* 1/2 quantization step added */
 if (iexp &gt; 1) /* now left shift according exponent */
 mant = mant « (iexp - 1);

 linbuf[n] = logbuf[n] &gt; 127 /* invert, if negative sample */
 ? mant
 : -mant;
}

=== μ-law ===

The μ-law (sometimes referred to as ulaw, G.711Mu, or G.711μ) encoding takes a 14-bit signed linear audio sample in two&#x27;s complement representation as input, inverts all bits after the sign bit if the value is negative, adds 33 (binary 100001) and converts it to an 8 bit value as follows:


Where is the sign bit, and bits marked are discarded.

In addition, the standard specifies that the encoded bits are inverted before the octet is transmitted. Thus, a silent μ-law encoded PCM channel has the 8 bit samples transmitted 0xFF instead of 0x00 in the octets.

Adding 33 is necessary so that all values fall into a compression group and it is subtracted back when decoding. 

Breaking the encoded value formatted as codice_3 into 4 bits of mantissa , 3 bits of exponent and 1 sign bit , the decoded linear value is given by formula
:formula_2
which is a 14-bit signed integer in the range ±0 to ±8031.

Note that 0 is transmitted as 0xFF, and −1 is transmitted as 0x7F, but when received the result is 0 in both cases.

== G.711.0 ==
G.711.0, also known as G.711 LLC, utilizes lossless data compression to reduce the bandwidth usage by as much as 50 percent. The &quot;Lossless compression of G.711 pulse code modulation&quot; standard was approved by ITU-T in September 2009.

== G.711.1 ==
G.711.1 &quot;Wideband embedded extension for G.711 pulse code modulation&quot; is a higher-fidelity extension to G.711, ratified in 2008 and further extended in 2012.

G.711.1 allows a series of enhancement layers on top of a raw G.711 core stream (Layer 0): Layer 1 codes 16-bit audio in the same 4kHz narrowband, and Layer 2 allows 8kHz wideband using MDCT; each uses a fixed 16 kbps in addition to the 64 kbps core. They may be used together or singly, and each encodes the differences from the previous layer. Ratified in 2012, Layer 3 extends Layer 2 to 16kHz &quot;superwideband,&quot; allowing another 16 kbps for the highest frequencies, while retaining layer independence. Peak bitrate becomes 96 kbps in original G.711.1, or 112 kbps with superwideband. No internal method of identifying or separating the layers is defined, leaving it to the implementation to packetize or signal them.

A decoder that doesn&#x27;t understand any set of fidelity layers may ignore or drop non-core packets without affecting it, enabling graceful degradation across any G.711 (or original G.711.1) telephony system with no changes.

Also ratified in 2012 was G.711.0 lossless extended to the new fidelity layers. Like G.711.0, full G.711 backward compatibility is sacrificed for efficiency, though a G.711.0 aware node may still ignore or drop layer packets it doesn&#x27;t understand.

== Licensing ==
The patents for G.711, released in 1972, have expired, so it may be used without the need for a license.

<doc id="104114" wikidata="Q737164" url="?curid=104114" title="Quartet in Autumn">
<text>Quartet in Autumn is a novel by British novelist Barbara Pym, first published in 1977. It was highly praised and shortlisted for the Booker Prize, the top literary prize in the UK. This was considered a comeback novel for Pym; she had fallen out of favour as styles changed, and her work had been rejected by publishers for 15 years. This followed her successful record as a novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s. As a novel, it represents a departure from her earlier style of light comedy, as it is the story of four office workers on the verge of retirement.

==Plot summary==
Marcia, Letty, Norman and Edwin work in the same office. None is married (Edwin being a widower) and all are nearing retirement age. Letty plans to move to the country and live with her long-time friend Marjorie, a widow. She has to change her plans when Marjorie announces that she is to marry a clergyman some years younger than herself.

The house in which Letty has a bedsit is sold and she becomes uncomfortable there. Edwin finds her a room in the house of an elderly widow, where she is reasonably comfortable. Letty and Marcia retire at the same time. Marcia, already reclusive, and vulnerable after having a breast removed, has to deal with the loss of the routine that was an essential part of her life. She withdraws even further from the outside world, and eats less and less. She is found in a state of collapse by a voluntary social worker who has been visiting her, and, coincidentally, by Edwin and his parish priest. She is taken to hospital but dies a few days later, weighing six stone. She has unexpectedly left her house to Norman, in whom she had indulged a brief and secret semi-romantic interest.

When Marjorie&#x27;s fiancé deserts her for a younger woman, she renews her invitation to Letty to come and live with her. But by now Letty is not so sure she wants to live in the country, and does not immediately make up her mind. She realises that she has opportunities to make her own choices. Similarly, Norman enjoys being in a position to decide whether or not to live in Marcia&#x27;s house, though he is inclined to sell it.

At the end of the book, Letty tells Norman and Edwin that Marjorie has invited the three of them to join her for a day in the country. She thinks this would be a consolation for the jilted Marjorie, and, though she envisages no romantic developments, enjoys being in a position to supply some male company.

==Publication history==
Pym conceived of the novel in 1972:
At the time, Pym was still working full-time at the International African Institute in London, and recovering from a mastectomy after developing cancer in her left breast. As she transitioned to retirement in late 1973 and 1974, Pym commenced work on the novel. Whereas most of her novels had been written in short time spans, Pym took three years to write &quot;Quartet in Autumn&quot;. She had not had a novel published since 1961, and had no realistic expectations that this would be either. She completed the novel in 1976, under the original title of &quot;Four Point Turn&quot;. The poet Philip Larkin, who had a long-running correspondence with Pym, read the final draft and found it very strong. He was surprised by the sombre tone, so unlike Pym&#x27;s earlier comic style, and suggested the title did not suit. Pym submitted the novel to Hamish Hamilton Limited in 1976 but it was rejected.

On 21 January 1977, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; ran an article in which high-profile literary figures named their most underrated and overrated authors or books of the previous 75 years. Pym was chosen as the most underrated writer by both Larkin and Lord David Cecil; she was the only novelist to be selected by two contributors. On the strength of this review, literary interest in Pym was revived after 16 years, and she was approached by several publishers for new material.

&quot;Quartet in Autumn&quot; was published by Macmillan in 1977. It was published in the United States by E.P. Dutton the following year, the second of her novels to be so (&quot;Less than Angels&quot; had been published in a small run in the 1950s) and the first to have mainstream success in the US.

The novel was released as an audiobook by Chivers Press, read by Elizabeth Stephan. It was published in Portugal as &quot;Quarteto no Outono&quot;, France as &quot;Quatuor d&#x27;automne&quot;, Germany as &quot;Quartett im Herbst&quot;, and Turkey as &quot;Sonbahar Kuarteti&quot;.

==Reception==
Combined with the media interest after the piece in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;Quartet in Autumn&quot; was a success, with almost universally positive reviews, including in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; considered the book &quot;Terribly brisk, but very affecting&quot;. The only publications to write mixed reviews were &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. As this was the first time most American readers had heard of Pym, there was especial interest in her from American media outlets. &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; favourably reviewed &quot;Quartet&quot; alongside the earlier &quot;Excellent Women&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a review entitled &quot;The Best High Comedy&quot;.

The novel was shortlisted for the 1977 Booker Prize, but the winner was Paul Scott&#x27;s &quot;Staying On&quot;.

==Connections to other works==
Edwin remembers Father Thames and Father Bode from &quot;A Glass of Blessings&quot;.

==Adaptation==
&quot;Quartet in Autumn&quot; was serialised by BBC radio on its &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; programme in 1978.

In 2015, York Theatre Royal commissioned a workshop version of a stage adaptation, written by Amanda Whittington and directed by C P Hallam.

<doc id="104116" wikidata="Q7559489" url="?curid=104116" title="Some Tame Gazelle">
<text>Some Tame Gazelle is Barbara Pym&#x27;s first novel, originally published in 1950.

The title of the book is taken from the poem &quot;Something to Love&quot; by Thomas Haynes Bayly, and the work of other English poets is frequently referenced during the course of the story. First started during Pym&#x27;s period studying at Oxford University, it contains many sly references to those she knew there.

==Plot==
The novel details episodes in the life of Belinda Bede, a spinster now in her fifties who shares a house with her younger, more dominant sister Harriet, who is also unmarried. Since her university days, Belinda has loved the village&#x27;s Archdeacon Hoccleve, with whom she studied then, although he had preferred to marry the better-connected Agatha, a bishop&#x27;s daughter. Harriet has an admirer in the village, the Italian Count Ricardo Bianco, who regularly proposes marriage to her, but her preference has always been to look after the welfare of young curates.

At the time the story begins, Mr Donne is the newly arrived curate in the village. Eventually he becomes engaged to Olivia Berridge, an academic specialising in Middle English literature and a niece of Agatha Hoccleve. But in the meantime, Agatha leaves for a visit to a German spa and another of Belinda&#x27;s and the Archdeacon&#x27;s student acquaintances comes to stay at the vicarage. This is Dr Parnell, now head of the main university library, who is accompanied by his assistant, the socially suspect Mr Mold. Before leaving, Mr Mold proposes marriage to Harriet and, refused, takes it calmly by visiting the local pub and counting himself well escaped.

When Agatha returns, she brings home Dr Grote, the colonial bishop of Mbawawa, a former protégé of Harriet&#x27;s during the time when he was a curate. Belinda begins to see in him another threat to her peaceful coexistence with her sister, but it is to herself that the bishop proposes in the end. When he too is rejected, he proposes instead to Connie Aspinall, a decayed gentlewoman living in the same village, and is accepted.

Harmony returns to the disrupted community with the marriage of Mr Donne and Olivia Berridge and their subsequent departure. As life returns to normal, a new curate arrives to claim Harriet&#x27;s attention, while Belinda finds &quot;such consolation as she needed in our greater English poets&quot;, gardening and good works.

==Publication history==
Pym started to write &quot;Some Tame Gazelle&quot; in 1934, shortly after completing her studies at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford. The novel was rejected by several publishers, including Jonathan Cape and Gollancz. Cape expressed interest in Pym&#x27;s writing, however, and encouraged her to make some alterations to the text and consider re-submitting. Pym&#x27;s friend, the up-and-coming literary critic Robert Liddell, provided detailed criticism of the novel to assist with edits.

World War II interrupted Pym&#x27;s budding literary career, and she finally revised the novel to the point where it was accepted by Cape in 1950. The novel sold 3,544 copies in Great Britain by the end of the 1950s, which was not a bestselling figure but was reasonable for a debut novelist. Among alternative titles that Pym considered were &quot;Some Sad Turtle&quot; and &quot;The Well Tam&#x27;d Heart&quot;.

The novel was first published in the United States by E.P. Dutton in 1983. In 2012, it was released as an audiobook by Hachette. &quot;Some Tame Gazelle&quot; was published in Italy as &quot;Qualcuno da amare&quot; (Someone to love) and in France with the title literally translated as &quot;Comme une gazelle apprivoisée&quot;.

==Reception==
The novel received several positive reviews. The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; called it &quot;an enchanting book about village life&quot; while Antonia White reviewed the novel for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;:
It has been considered a remarkable first novel, because of the way in which the youthful Pym — who began the book while still a student — imagined herself into the situation of a middle-aged spinster, living with her sister in the country. The poet Philip Larkin regarded &quot;Some Tame Gazelle&quot; as Pym&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; 

==Characters==
Two months after she had begun work on the first draft in 1934, Barbara Pym noted in her diary that &quot;Some time in July I began writing a story about Hilary and me as spinsters of fiftyish. Henry, Jock and all of us appeared in it.&quot; There exists a first edition of its much edited final version annotated in the author&#x27;s hand with a pencilled list identifying the characters based on her friends and associates. A later scholar has therefore drawn the conclusion that originally &quot;Some Tame Gazelle&quot; &quot;was to be a roman à clef for her particular circle&quot;.

Besides herself and her sister Hilary, who are the characters Belinda and Harriet Bede, many others with whom Barbara Pym had associated at Oxford were included, sometimes under revealing names. Henry Harvey, her (and Belinda&#x27;s) abiding love interest, is transformed into Archdeacon Hoccleve; the Archdeacon&#x27;s wife Agatha is identified with, not the woman that Henry eventually married, but Alison West–Watson, a more successful girlfriend than was Barbara. Three of the characters were based on former librarians at the Bodleian at one time or another, although the library itself is never identified by name in the novel. Principal among them was Robert Liddell, nicknamed &quot;Jock&quot; as in the diary entry, who is Dr Nicholas Parnell, the former university friend who comes to stay with the Archdeacon. The other two librarians were Count Roberto Weiss and John Barnicot, who become the novel&#x27;s Count Ricardo Bianco and his dead friend John Akenside. Two more women also had real-life counterparts. Edith Liversidge was based on Honor Tracy, once Liddell&#x27;s love interest, while Lady Clara Boulding has been identified with Lady Julia Pakenham, a daughter of the 5th Earl of Longford.

All through her life, Barbara Pym recorded odd names that pleased or amused her – for example, a cathedral organist named A. Surplice. A roman à clef like &quot;Some Tame Gazelle&quot; gave her full scope for a range of private jokes of that kind. The Bede sisters, who gain excitement from so small a village event as the departure of the vicar&#x27;s wife watched from behind bedroom curtains, are given the same surname as the ecclesiastical historian, The Venerable Bede. And Dr Theo Grote, who gives slide-lectures on the Mbawawa people, shares his name with George Grote, author of the voluminous &quot;History of Greece&quot;.

Then, in a novel where so much is made of &quot;our greater poets&quot;, the characters bear the name of several. The Augustan poets Thomas Parnell and Matthew Prior give their names to the librarian Dr Parnell and the dressmaker Miss Prior. Other 18th century literary names include Akenside, that of the Count&#x27;s letter-writing friend, and Piozzi, which was the name given the Count in Pym&#x27;s original manuscript before the editors at Cape made her change it. Edgar Donne, who pronounces his name as &quot;Don&quot;, is embarrassed by the Archdeacon&#x27;s insistence that it should be pronounced like the poet John Donne’s as &quot;Dunne&quot;. The Archdeacon himself also has a poet&#x27;s name, that of Thomas Chaucer&#x27;s disciple Thomas Hoccleve, and quotes both John Gower and Chaucer to an uncomprehending congregation in his sermons. The humour is further underlined by his wife and her niece both being more erudite students of Middle English literature.

Pym&#x27;s characters sometimes recur in minor roles in later novels. Archdeacon Hoccleve featured in &quot;Excellent Women&quot; and &quot;A Glass of Blessings&quot;. Harriet Bede reappeared in &quot;An Unsuitable Attachment&quot;, in which Count Bianco&#x27;s death is also reported.

==Adaptation==
&quot;Some Tame Gazelle&quot; was adapted as a radio play by BBC Radio 4 in 1995 with Miriam Margolyes as Harriet and Hannah Gordon as Belinda.

<text>Strangers and Brothers is a series of novels by C. P. Snow, published between 1940 and 1970. They deal with – among other things – questions of political and personal integrity, and the mechanics of exercising power.

==Plot==
All eleven novels in the series are narrated by the character Lewis Eliot. The series follows his life and career from humble beginnings in an English provincial town, to reasonably successful London lawyer, to Cambridge don, to wartime service in Whitehall, to senior civil servant and finally retirement.

&quot;The New Men&quot; deals with the scientific community&#x27;s involvement in (and reaction to) the development and deployment of nuclear weapons during the Second World War. &quot;The Conscience of the Rich&quot; concerns a wealthy, Anglo-Jewish merchant-banking family. &quot;Time of Hope&quot; and &quot;George Passant&quot; depict the price paid by clever, poor young men to escape their provincial origins.

Snow analyses the professional world, scrutinising microscopic shifts of power within the enclosed settings of a Cambridge college, a Whitehall ministry, a law firm. For example, in the novels set in the Cambridge college (a thinly veiled Christ&#x27;s), a small, disparate group of men is typically required to reach a collective decision on an important subject. In &quot;The Masters&quot;, the dozen or so college members elect a new head (the Master) by majority vote. In &quot;The Affair&quot;, a small group of dons sets out to correct a possible injustice: they must convince the rest of the college to re-open an investigation into scientific fraud. In both novels, the characters strongly resist letting in the external world, whether it be the press, public opinion, the college Visitor, or outside experts.

==Narrative order==
The narrative order of the books differs from their publication order.

== Adaptations ==

The books were adapted by the BBC into a 13-episode television series, which began airing in January 1984. The series starred Shaughan Seymour as Lewis, Sheila Ruskin as his mentally troubled first wife Sheila and Cherie Lunghi as his second wife Margaret. Other actors who were cast for the series include Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Havers, Peter Sallis and Tom Wilkinson. The series has been released on DVD in the Region 1 and 2 formats.

The BBC later adapted the books as a 10-episode Radio 4 Classic Serial, first broadcast in 2003, which starred Adam Godley (ep.1-5) then David Haig (ep.6-10) as Lewis, Anastasia Hille as Sheila and Juliet Aubrey as Margaret.

<doc id="104120" wikidata="Q442330" url="?curid=104120" title="Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)">
<text>Elizabeth Taylor (née Coles; 3 July 1912 – 19 November 1975) was an English novelist and short-story writer. Kingsley Amis described her as &quot;one of the best English novelists born in this century&quot;. Antonia Fraser called her &quot;one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century&quot;, while Hilary Mantel said she was &quot;deft, accomplished and somewhat underrated&quot;.

==Life and writings==
Born in Reading, Berkshire, the daughter of Oliver Coles, an insurance inspector, and his wife Elsie May Fewtrell, Elizabeth was educated at The Abbey School, Reading, and then worked as a governess, tutor and librarian. She married in 1936 John Taylor, owner of a confectionery company, after which they lived in Penn, Buckinghamshire for almost all their married life. She was briefly a member of the British Communist Party, then a consistent Labour Party supporter.

Taylor&#x27;s first novel, &quot;At Mrs. Lippincote&#x27;s&quot;, was published in 1945. It was followed by eleven more. Her short stories were published in magazines and collected in four volumes. She also wrote a children&#x27;s book. The English critic Philip Hensher called &quot;The Soul of Kindness&quot; a novel &quot;so expert that it seems effortless. As it progresses, it seems as if the cast are so fully rounded that all the novelist had to do was place them, successively, in one setting after another and observe how they reacted to each other... The plot... never feels as if it were organised in advance; it feels as if it arises from her characters&#x27; mutual responses.&quot;

Taylor&#x27;s work is mainly concerned with the nuances of everyday life and situations. She was a friend of the novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett and of the novelist and critic Robert Liddell. Her long correspondence with the latter forms the subject of one of her short stories, &quot;The Letter Writers&quot; (published in &quot;The Blush&quot;, 1951), but the letters were destroyed, in line with her general policy of keeping her private life private. A horror of publicity is the subject of another celebrated short story, &quot;Sisters&quot;, written in 1969.

Anne Tyler once compared Taylor to Jane Austen, Barbara Pym and Elizabeth Bowen – &quot;soul sisters all,&quot; in Tyler&#x27;s words.

Taylor was also a close friend of Elizabeth Jane Howard, who was asked by Taylor&#x27;s widower to write a biography following Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s death. Howard refused due to what she felt was a lack of incident in Taylor&#x27;s life. See &quot;Slipstream&quot;, Elizabeth Jane Howard&#x27;s memoir, for more details on their friendship. Taylor&#x27;s editor at the UK publisher Chatto &amp; Windus was the poet D. J. Enright.

Elizabeth Taylor died of cancer in Penn, Buckinghamshire, at the age of 63.

Perhaps the first film adaption of one of her works was on the television series &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, in September 1980, of the short story &quot;The Flypaper.&quot; This broadcast became one of the infamously dark and sinister episodes in British TV history. In the 21st century a new interest in her work was kindled by film-makers. Ruth Sacks Caplin had written a film screenplay based on Taylor&#x27;s novel &quot;Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont&quot; in the 1970s, but it languished for decades until her son, Lee Caplin, purchased the rights to the film in 1999. Ruth Sacks Caplin&#x27;s film adaptation, &quot;Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont&quot;, directed by Dan Ireland, was finally released in 2005 with British actress Joan Plowright in the title role.

French director François Ozon made a 2007 film of &quot;Angel&quot; with Romola Garai.

<text>Jean Rhys, ( ; born Ella Gwendoline Rees Williams; 24 August 1890 – 14 May 1979) was a novelist who was born and grew up in the Caribbean island of Dominica. From the age of 16, she resided mainly in England, where she was sent for her education. She is best known for her novel &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; (1966), written as a prequel to Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. In 1978, she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her writing.

==Early life==
Rhys&#x27;s father, William Rees Williams, was a Welsh medical doctor and her mother, Minna Williams, née Lockhart, a third-generation Dominican Creole of Scots ancestry. (&quot;Creole&quot; was broadly used in those times to refer to any person born on the island, whether they were of European or African descent, or both.) She had a brother. Her mother&#x27;s family had an estate, a former plantation, on the island.

Rhys was educated in Dominica until the age of 16, when she was sent to England to live with an aunt, as her relations with her mother were difficult. She attended the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, where she was mocked as an outsider and for her accent. She attended two terms at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London by 1909. Her instructors despaired of her ever learning to speak &quot;proper English&quot; and advised her father to take her away. Unable to train as an actress and refusing to return to the Caribbean as her parents wished, Rhys worked with varied success as a chorus girl, adopting the names Vivienne, Emma, or Ella Gray. She toured Britain&#x27;s small towns and returned to rooming or boarding houses in rundown neighbourhoods of London.

After her father died in 1910, Rhys appears to have experimented with living as an artist&#x27;s model after she became the mistress of wealthy stockbroker Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, whose father Hugh Colin Smith had been Governor of the Bank of England. Though a bachelor, Smith did not offer to marry Rhys, and their affair soon ended. However, he continued to be an occasional source of financial help. Distraught by events, including a near-fatal abortion, Rhys began writing sketches and short stories.

During the First World War, Rhys served as a volunteer worker in a soldiers&#x27; canteen. In 1918, she worked in a pension office to help the families of dead or wounded soldiers and sailors.

==Marriage and family==
In 1919, Rhys married Willem Johan Marie (Jean) Lenglet, a French-Dutch journalist, spy, and songwriter. He was the first of her three husbands. She and Lenglet lived in Paris, where their baby son died, before living in Vienna and Budapest before returning to Paris. Their daughter was born in 1922. In 1924, the year that the newly named Jean Rhys was discovered and published by the English writer Ford Madox Ford, Lenglet was imprisoned for embezzlement. The couple eventually divorced in 1933, but remained loyal to each others&#x27; work, while sharing the care of their daughter, Maryvonne.

The next year, Rhys married Leslie Tilden-Smith, an English agent and editor. In 1936, they went briefly to Dominica, the first time Rhys had returned since she had left for school. Her brother Owen was living in England, and she took care of some financial affairs for him, making a settlement with a mixed-race woman on the island and Owen&#x27;s illegitimate children by her.The visit exerted a powerful influence on Rhys&#x27;s most famous novel, Wide Sargasso Sea.

In 1937, Rhys began a friendship with novelist Eliot Bliss (who had adopted that first name in honour of an admired writer). The two women shared Caribbean backgrounds. The correspondence between them survives. Rhys also became close to Phyllis Shand Allfree, whose family also lived in Dominica.

Rhys and Tilden-Smith lived in London through World War II, while Rhys agonised over the possible fate of her daughter, living in Amsterdam. (Maryvonne had joined the Dutch Resistance and married a fellow fighter against Fascism) Tilden-Smith died in 1945. In 1947, Rhys married Max Hamer, a solicitor who was a cousin of Tilden-Smith. He was convicted of fraud and imprisoned after their marriage. Rhys remained admirably loyal to him throughout, while their lives descended into conditions of extreme poverty, including even the hold of a boat and a horsebox. They settled in 1960, in a cottage in Cheriton Fitzpaine, purchased for Rhys by her oldest brother, Edward. Max Hamer died in 1966, the year in which Wide Sargasso Sea began a remarkable change in Rhys&#x27; fortunes.

==Writing career==
In 1924, Rhys came under the influence of Ford Madox Ford. After meeting Ford in Paris, Rhys wrote short stories under his patronage. Ford recognised that her experience as an exile gave Rhys a unique viewpoint, and praised her &quot;singular instinct for form&quot;. &quot;Coming from the West Indies, [Ford] declared, &#x27;with a terrifying insight and... passion for stating the case of the underdog, she has let her pen loose on the Left Banks of the Old World&#x27;.&quot; This he wrote in his preface to her debut short story collection, &quot;The Left Bank and Other Stories&quot; (1927).

It was Ford who suggested she change her name from Ella Williams to Jean Rhys. At the time her husband was in jail for what Rhys described as currency irregularities. Rhys moved in with Ford and his long-time partner Stella Bowen. An affair with Ford ensued, which she portrayed in fictionalised form in her novel &quot;Quartet&quot; (1928). Her protagonist is a stranded foreigner, Marya Zelli, who finds herself at the mercy of strangers when her husband is jailed in Paris. The 1981 film adaptation of the novel was produced by Merchant Ivory Productions.

In &quot;After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie&quot; (1931), the protagonist, Julia Martin, is a more unravelled version of Marya Zelli, romantically dumped and inhabiting the pavements, cafes and cheap hotel rooms of Paris.

With &quot;Voyage in the Dark&quot; (1934), Rhys continued to portray a mistreated, rootless woman. Here the narrator, Anna, is a young chorus girl who grew up in the West Indies and feels alienated in England.

&quot;Good Morning, Midnight&quot; (1939) is sometimes (inaccurately) considered a continuation of Rhys&#x27;s first two novels. Here, she uses modified stream of consciousness to voice the experiences of an ageing woman, Sasha Jansen, who drinks, takes sleeping pills, and obsesses over her looks, and is adrift again in Paris. &quot;Good Morning, Midnight&quot;, acknowledged as well written but deemed depressing, came as World War II broke out and readers sought optimism. This seemingly ended Rhys&#x27;s literary career.

In the 1940s, Rhys largely withdrew from public life. From 1955 to 1960, she lived in Bude, Cornwall, where she was unhappy, calling it &quot;Bude the Obscure&quot;, before moving to Cheriton Fitzpaine, a small village in Devon.

After a long absence from the public eye, she was rediscovered in Beckenham, South London, by Selma Vaz Dias, who in 1949 placed an advertisement in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel &quot;Good Morning, Midnight&quot; for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable WH Smith Literary Award in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Jamaica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr. Rochester and deteriorates in England as the &quot;madwoman in the attic&quot;. Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Diana Athill of André Deutsch gambled on publishing &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;. She and the writer Francis Wyndham helped to revive interest in Rhys&#x27;s work. There have been film, operatic and radio adaptations of the book.

In 1968, André Deutsch published a collection of Rhys&#x27; short stories, &quot;Tigers Are Better-Looking&quot;, of which eight were written during her 1950s period of obscurity and nine republished from her 1927 collection &quot;The Left Bank and Other Stories&quot;. Her 1969 short story &quot;I Spy a Stranger&quot;, published by Penguin Modern Stories, was adapted for TV in 1972 for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Thirty-Minute Theatre&quot; starring Mona Washbourne, Noel Dyson, Hanah Maria Pravda, and Basil Dignam. In 1976, Deutsch published another collection of her short stories, &quot;Sleep It Off Lady&quot;, consisting of 16 pieces from an approximately 75-year period, starting from the end of the 19th century.

==Later years==
From 1960, and for the rest of her life, Rhys lived in Cheriton Fitzpaine in Devon, once described by her as &quot;a dull spot which even drink can&#x27;t enliven much.&quot; Characteristically, she remained unimpressed by her belated ascent to literary fame, commenting, &quot;It has come too late.&quot; In an interview shortly before her death she questioned whether any novelist, not least herself, could ever be happy for any length of time: &quot;If I could choose I would rather be happy than write... if I could live my life all over again, and choose...&quot;

==Death==
Jean Rhys died in Exeter on 14 May 1979, at the age of 88, before completing an autobiography, which she had begun dictating only months earlier. In 1979, the incomplete text was published posthumously under the title &quot;Smile Please: An Unfinished Autobiography&quot;.

==Legacy and honours==
In an appreciation in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; in 1974, A. Alvarez called Jean Rhys “quite simply, the best living English novelist&quot;.

Jean Rhys was appointed a CBE in the 1978 New Year Honours.

Australian filmmaker John Duigan directed a 1993 erotic drama, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;, based on Rhys&#x27;s best-known novel.

The 2003 book and stage play &quot;After Mrs Rochester&quot; by Polly Teale is based on the life of Jean Rhys and her book, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;.

In 2012, English Heritage marked her Chelsea flat at Paulton House in Paultons Square with a blue plaque.

In 2020, a pen allegedly owned by Rhys - a devotee of the ballpoint - was added to the Royal Society of Literature&#x27;s historic collection for the signing of their Roll Book.

===Archives===
Rhys&#x27;s collected papers and ephemera are housed in the University of Tulsa&#x27;s McFarlin Library. The British Library acquired a selection of Jean Rhys Papers in 1972, including drafts of short stories, novels; &quot;After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie&quot;, &quot;Voyage in the Dark&quot;, and &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;, and an unpublished play entitled &quot;English Harbour&quot;. Research material relating to Jean Rhys can also be found in the Archive of Margaret Ramsey Ltd at the British Library relating to stage and film rights for adaptations to her work. The British Library also holds correspondence between Jean Rhys and Patrick Garland relating to his adaptation of &quot;I Spy a Stranger&quot; and about &quot;Quartet&quot;.

<text>These monasteries were dissolved by King Henry VIII of England in the dissolution of the monasteries. The list is by no means exhaustive, since over 800 religious houses existed before the Reformation, and virtually every town, of any size, had at least one abbey, priory, convent or friary in it. (Often many small houses of monks, nuns, canons or friars.)

<text>Eileen Mary Challans (4 September 1905 – 13 December 1983), known by her pen name Mary Renault (), was a British writer best known for her historical novels set in ancient Greece.

Born in Forest Gate in 1905, she attended St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 1924 until 1928. After graduating from St Hugh&#x27;s with a Third Class in English, she worked as a nurse and began writing her first novels, which were contemporary romances. In 1948, she moved to Durban, South Africa with her partner, Julie Mullard, and later to Cape Town, where she spent the rest of her life. Living in South Africa allowed her to write about openly gay characters without fearing the censorship and homophobia of England. She devoted herself to writing historical fiction in the 1950s, which were also her most successful books. She is best known for her historical fiction today.

Renault&#x27;s works are often rooted in themes related to love, sexuality and relationships. Her books attracted a large gay following at the time of their publication, when few mainstream works depicted homosexuality in a positive light. Her work has had a generally positive reception by critics. She has received numerous awards and honours, both during her lifetime and posthumously.

== Biography ==
=== Youth and education ===
Eileen Mary Challans was born on 4 September 1905 at Dacre Lodge, 49 Plashet Road, Forest Gate, Essex. She was the elder daughter of physician Frank Challans and (Mary) Clementine Newsome, daughter of dentist John Baxter, who claimed descent from the Puritan church leader Richard Baxter. Her mother was &quot;a desperately aspirational housewife, whose favourite word was &#x27;nice&#x27;&quot;. She had one younger sister, (Frances) Joyce, who Challans always felt was the favourite daughter. She had a comfortable, yet strained childhood; her parents had a contentious relationship, and her father was neglectful of his children. When she was 15, her mother&#x27;s sister Bertha paid for her to be sent to a boarding school in Bristol, and then to attend the University of Oxford. As a result of entering boarding school later than most of her peers, Challans struggled to catch up in mathematics and Latin. She relied on the Loeb Classical Library to read Greek and Latin texts with English translation.

Challans was educated first at Levick Family School and Clifton Girls School in Bristol. She began attending St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, then an all-women&#x27;s college, in 1924. While at St Hugh&#x27;s, she studied history, mythology, philosophy and ancient literature. Although her studies included classical languages such as Latin, her Ancient Greek language skills were self taught. She graduated with an undergraduate degree in English in 1928. One of her tutors was J.R.R. Tolkien, who encouraged her to write a novel set in medieval times, but she burned the manuscript because she felt it lacked authenticity.

=== Nursing and early writing ===
Challans&#x27; mother encouraged her to take an interest in marriage. Following her degree, when her father refused to support her career as a writer, she left home and, to support herself, trained as a nurse. She began her training in 1933 at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. During her training she met Julie Mullard, a fellow nurse with whom she established a lifelong romantic relationship. Despite the mores of the time and the fact that Mullard had received an offer of marriage from one of her male lovers, they were determined to be a couple. They sneaked into each other&#x27;s rooms at night, and on one occasion had to hide beneath the sheets when a matron burst in.

Challans worked as a nurse while writing her first novel, &quot;Purposes of Love,&quot; using the pseudonym Mary Renault to keep her writing secret should it meet with disapproval. She chose this pseudonym from Froissart&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; and used it for the entirety of her professional literary career. The novel was published in 1939 by Longman in the United Kingdom, and by William Morrow and Company in the United States. After receiving a cash advance from Morrow, Challans bought an MG sports car. Although Challans had failed her driving test, she decided to drive the car anyway along with Mullard, who also did not have a driving licence. They were involved in a road traffic accident in June 1939 which seriously injured Mullard, who was hospitalized for facial injuries. A few weeks later, the two women retreated to a small cottage in Cornwall where they lived off the income from &quot;Purposes of Love&quot;. Challans had nearly completed her second novel when World War II began. By May 1940, both Challans and Mullard had been called in to treat patients at Winford Emergency Hospital in Bristol. There, they briefly treated evacuees from the Battle of Dunkirk. Renault worked in the Radcliffe Infirmary&#x27;s brain surgery ward until 1945.

Her novel &quot;The Friendly Young Ladies&quot; (1943), about a lesbian relationship between a writer and a nurse, is thought to be inspired by her relationship with Mullard. It is the only lesbian novel written by Renault.

=== Academic and writing career ===
In 1948, after winning an MGM prize worth £37,000 for &quot;Return to Night&quot;, Challans was able to leave nursing and devote herself to writing full time. Challans and Mullard emigrated to Durban, South Africa, which was home to a community of gay and lesbian expatriates who had left the more sexually repressive environments of Britain and the United States. Because of this, Challans and Mullard were able to live together as a couple without causing much controversy. Challans worked successfully as an author after the couple&#x27;s arrival in South Africa in 1948, and continued to write until her death in 1983. In 1964, she became president of the South African chapter of International PEN, an association of writers, a position which she held until 1981. Both women were critical of the less liberal aspects of their new home, and participated in the Black Sash movement against apartheid in the 1950s. However, Challans was occasionally disillusioned with the Black Sash on account of its insufficiently radical leanings, such as when it refused to protest against the implementation of anti-homosexuality laws in 1968.

Challans travelled in Africa, Greece and Crete, but never returned to Britain. She had a mutual admiration for the novelist Patrick O&#x27;Brian, with whom she exchanged letters. Her earlier British reputation as a writer of sensationalist bestsellers faded, and in 1983 she was listed as one of the famous alumnae who had brought honour to the Radcliffe Infirmary Nurses&#x27; Home. Challans became ill in August 1983, and was diagnosed with lung cancer and pneumonia. In her final days she tried to complete a final novel, which remained unfinished after she went into residential hospice care. She died in Cape Town on 13 December 1983. She directed her papers, including correspondence and the partially finished manuscript, were to be burned upon her death. Mullard died in 1996.

== Chronology of writing ==
Beginning with &quot;Purposes of Love&quot;, Challans&#x27; first six novels had a contemporary setting. She published &quot;Return to Night&quot; in 1947. This was followed by &quot;The North Face&quot; in 1948.

Challans&#x27; last contemporary romance novel, &quot;The Charioteer&quot; (1953), marked a change in theme. It tells the story of two young gay servicemen in the 1940s who try to model their relationship on the ideals expressed in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and &quot;Symposium&quot;. It echoed themes which Challans later revisited with her historical novels.

Between 1956 and 1981, Challans turned to historical fiction, all of which was set in ancient Greece. Challans, by then in her mid-fifties, made her first foray into historical fiction with &quot;The Last of the Wine&quot;. The novel was her greatest financial and critical success to date, and she followed it with several other historical novels. Her historical novels include a pair of novels about the mythological hero Theseus and a trilogy about the career of Alexander the Great.

==Themes==

=== Relationships ===
A central theme in Challans&#x27; work, both contemporary and historical, is the presentation of love as a struggle between the pursuer and the pursued. This dynamic was greatly influenced by the philosophy of Plato, in particular &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, his dialogue on love. Hierarchical relationships, involving age gaps or differences in social status, are frequently explored in Challans&#x27; novels. In her novels featuring same-sex couples, these hierarchies serve as an alternative to traditional gender roles. &quot;Fire from Heaven&quot; centres on the relationship between Alexander and his lover Hephaestion, while &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; is about the relationship between the enslaved Bagoas and Alexander. The novelist Linda Proud described &quot;Purposes of Love&quot; as &quot;a strange combination of Platonism and hospital romance&quot;. Challans&#x27; &quot;Return to Night&quot;, another hospital romance, explores the power dynamics between Hillary, a doctor, and a younger man with whom she has an affair.

=== Sexuality ===
Many of Challans&#x27; contemporary romance novels explored same-sex love and desire through their characters. For example, Colanna, an openly lesbian character, features in &quot;Purposes of Love&quot;. &quot;The Charioteer&quot; has been noted as an early example of the &quot;Gay novel&quot;. It was written during a period of time when male homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom, particularly under the policies implemented by David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir, who was Home Secretary from 1951 to 1954. Simon Russell Beale described its contemporary context as &quot;that sombre, twilit world of the early 1950s, when so much of homosexual life was threaded through with fear of exposure.&quot; The protagonists of the novel, Ralph and Laurie, look to Greek ideals as a template for how to understand their own masculinity and homosexuality. The society of Classical Greece acts as a more tolerant and liberating alternative to contemporary British society.

Challans&#x27; American publishers refused to publish &quot;The Charioteer&quot; for fear of prosecution. Renault attributed this hesitancy to the rise of McCarthyism in the United States. It was not published in the United States until 1959, which made it a somewhat later addition to homosexual literature in the United States because American readers and critics had accepted serious gay love stories in such works as Djuna Barnes&#x27; &quot;Nightwood&quot; (1936), Carson McCullers&#x27; &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (1941), Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; (1948) and Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; (1948).

Her &quot;Alexander Trilogy&quot; was one of the first mainstream literary works to feature homosexual relationships prominently. By turning away from the twentieth century and writing stories about male lovers in the warrior societies of ancient Greece, Renault no longer had to deal with homosexuality and anti-gay prejudice as social &quot;problems&quot;. Instead, she was free to consider larger ethical and philosophical concerns while examining the nature of love and leadership.

=== Role of women ===
Women do not play a large role in Challans&#x27; historical fiction, and are relegated to the role of wives and mothers. They often behave in stereotypical ways, being simultaneously helpless and ruthless. Critics have remarked on the negative portrayal of women, particularly mothers, in her work. This is often attributed to the fraught relationship Challans had with her own mother. David Sweetman remarks in his biography of Challans that her novels generally portray mothers in a poor light and that, particularly in her later novels, this is extended to women in general. Daniel Mendelsohn said that both her &quot;contemporary and the Greek novels feature unsettling depictions of bad marriages and, particularly, of nightmarishly passive-aggressive wives and mothers.&quot; Her generally negative depiction of women has also been noted by the critic Carolyn Gold Heilbrun.

== Views ==
Challans was a Platonist, which influenced her personal views on love and relationships.

=== Gay liberation ===
Though Challans appreciated her gay following, she was uncomfortable with the &quot;gay pride&quot; movement that emerged in the 1970s after the Stonewall riots, and she was reluctant to identify as a lesbian. Like Laurie Odell, the protagonist of &quot;The Charioteer&quot;, she was suspicious of identifying oneself primarily by one&#x27;s sexual orientation. Late in her life she expressed hostility to the gay rights movement, troubling some of her fans. Her views on the gay rights movement were elaborated upon in an afterword to &quot;The Friendly Ladies&quot; written shortly before her death in 1983.Congregated homosexuals waving banners are really not conducive to a goodnatured &#x27;Vive la difference!&#x27; ... People who do not consider themselves to be, primarily, human beings amongst their fellow humans, deserve to be discriminated against, and ought not to make a meal of it.

=== Apartheid ===
After relocating to South Africa in the late 1940s, Challans was involved in the anti-apartheid movement, although not as actively as many of her contemporaries. In a 1979 interview, Challans said that although she signed petitions and written protests against apartheid, she did not &quot;pass [herself] off as a heroine. You don&#x27;t get locked up for writing protests.&quot; According to Challans, she did not feel strongly compelled to write about apartheid in her novels because it made no major impact on her life, saying &quot;I have never profited from apartheid and I have never been segregated.&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==

=== Reception ===
Challans&#x27; work was generally well received during her lifetime, and has enjoyed a continuously positive reception in retrospective reviews. The historian Tom Holland said that &quot;No other novelist has so successfully evoked the beauty, the charisma and the terror of ancient Greece.&quot; Peter Parker of &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, described &quot;The Charioteer&quot; as a &quot;classic&quot; in a 2014 review. Her novels, both historical and contemporary, have been republished by Virago.

&quot;Fire from Heaven&quot;, her novel about Alexander the Great, was one of the six books shortlisted for the Lost Man Booker Prize in 2010.

Noël Coward&#x27;s reception of Challans&#x27; work and her portrayal of homosexual relationships in particular was less warm:

I have also read &quot;The Charioteer&quot; by Miss Mary Renault. Oh dear, I do, do wish well-intentioned ladies would not write books about homosexuality. This one is turgid, unreal and so ghastly earnest. It takes the hero – &quot;soi-disant&quot; – three hundred pages to reconcile himself to being queer as a coot, and his soul-searching and deep, deep introspection is truly awful. There are &#x27;queer&#x27; parties in which everyone calls everyone &#x27;my dear&#x27; a good deal, and over the whole book is a shimmering lack of understanding of the subject. I&#x27;m sure the poor woman meant well but I wish she&#x27;d stick to recreating the glory that was Greece and not fuck about with dear old modern homos.

=== Historical accuracy ===
Although not a classicist by training, Challans was admired in her day for her scrupulous recreations of the ancient Greek world. Her work was critically acclaimed for the meticulously researched historical detail she included. Some of the history presented in her fiction and in her non-fiction work, &quot;The Nature of Alexander,&quot; has been called into question, however. Her novels about Theseus rely on the controversial theories of Robert Graves, and take liberties in depicting the society of ancient Crete. Mary Beard and John Henderson observed Challans&#x27; novels create &quot;in mythical prehistoric Crete [...] a weird &#x27;other world&#x27;, where a society free from &#x27;our&#x27; inhibitions (particularly sexual) can be realized.&quot;

Some of her portrayals of individual historical figures have also been criticized. Her portrait of Alexander has been criticized as uncritical and romanticised. Kevin Kopelson, Professor of English at the University of Iowa, felt that Challans &quot;mischaracterise[d] pederastic relationships as heroic.&quot; Defying centuries of admiration for Demosthenes as a great orator, Challans portrayed him as a cruel, corrupt and cowardly demagogue.

=== Legacy and influence ===
Challans&#x27; work drew a wide readership. When asked who his favourite author was, John F. Kennedy replied &quot;Mary Renault&quot;.

At the time they were published, Challans&#x27; works were among the few novels to present love between persons of the same sex as a natural part of life, rather than a problem. Daniel Mendelsohn discussed the impact that Challans&#x27; work, and their correspondences, had on him as young boy. &quot;The Charioteer&quot; has been described as &quot;a historical gay document&quot;, providing guidance and comfort to gay men through classical literature in an essentially hostile world. Her sympathetic treatment of love between men won her a wide gay readership, and led to rumours that Challans was a gay man writing under a female pseudonym. Challans found these rumours amusing but also sought to distance herself from being labelled a &quot;gay writer&quot;.

Challans&#x27; work has influenced historical fiction and classical literature. The historian Bettany Hughes credited Renault with capturing the &quot;hardcore, drug-saturated sensuality of the ancient world.&quot; Hughes later wrote the introduction to reprints of her work, including &quot;The King Must Die&quot; and &quot;The Bull From the Sea&quot;.

She has been cited as an inspiration by novelists such as Douglas Stuart and Kate Forsyth. Suzanne Collins said that &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; was partly inspired by &quot;The King Must Die&quot;, which reimagined Minos&#x27; Labyrinth as an arena where Athenian tributes had to fight for their lives to entertain the Cretan elite.

Bernard Dick wrote &quot;The Hellenism of Mary Renault&quot; (1972), which analyzed the classical influences reflected in her corpus of work. Dick corresponded with Challans from 1969 until her death in 1983. The letters were eventually donated to the St Hugh&#x27;s College archive, which also holds other letters and transcriptions of interviews with Challans before her death.

An hour-long documentary about her life titled &quot;Mary Renault – Love and War in Ancient Greece&quot; was aired on BBC Four in 2006. The documentary included contributions from Hughes, filmmaker Oliver Stone, and broadcaster Sue MacGregor. The Mary Renault Prize is offered at St Hugh&#x27;s College, Challans&#x27; alma mater. It awards cash prizes to the best essays on the Classical reception, funded by royalties from Challans&#x27; work.

=== Adaptations of her work ===
&quot;The King Must Die&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Bull from the Sea&quot; were adapted by Michael Bakewell into a single 11-part BBC Radio 4 serial entitled &quot;The King Must Die&quot;. It was directed by David Spenser and broadcast between 5 June 1983 and 14 August 1983. It starred Gary Bond (Theseus), John Westbrook (Pittheus), Frances Jeater (queen of Eleusis), Carole Boyd (Aithra), Alex Jennings (Amyntor), Sarah Badel, David March and Christopher Guard.

&quot;The Charioteer&quot; was adapted into a ten-episode serial for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Book at Bedtime, read by Anton Lesser and produced by Clive Brill, which was broadcast over two weeks from 25 November 2013.

<text>Thomas Woolner (17 December 1825 – 7 October 1892) was an English sculptor and poet who was one of the founder-members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He was the only sculptor among the original members.

After participating in the foundation of the PRB, Woolner emigrated for a period to Australia. He returned to Britain to have a successful career as a sculptor, creating many important public works as well as memorials, tomb sculptures and narrative reliefs. He corresponded with many notable men of the day and also had some success as a poet and as an art dealer. One of his notable portrait medallions is that of the poet William Wordsworth in St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Grasmere; Wordsworth is buried in the adjoining graveyard.

==Art career==
Born in Hadleigh, Suffolk, Woolner trained with the sculptor William Behnes, exhibiting work at the Royal Academy from 1843. He became friendly with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and was invited by him to join the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Woolner was active in the early history of the group, emphasising the need for a more vivid form of realism in sculpture. Woolner&#x27;s classical inclinations became increasingly difficult to reconcile with Pre-Raphaelite Medievalism, but his belief in close observation of nature was consistent with their aims.

Woolner&#x27;s sculptures immediately after the foundation of the Brotherhood in 1848 display close attention to detail. He made his name with forceful portrait busts and medallions, but was at first unable to make a living. He was forced to emigrate to Australia in 1852 (inspiring the painting &quot;The Last of England&quot; by Ford Madox Brown), but after a year he returned to Britain, soon establishing himself as both a sculptor and art-dealer.

His visit to Australia nevertheless helped him to obtain commissions there and elsewhere for statues of British imperial heroes, such as Captain Cook and Sir Stamford Raffles. His bronze statue of John Robert Godley in Christchurch, New Zealand, was toppled and shattered into several pieces by the February 2011 earthquake. It has since been repaired and was re-erected in March 2015.

Woolner became a close friend of Francis Turner Palgrave. The two shared a house and both were known for their combative personalities. Henry Adams refers to them in &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot;, noting that Woolner had a &quot;rough&quot; personality and had to make &quot;a supernatural effort&quot; to be polite. Woolner designed the frontispiece of a piping youth for Palgrave&#x27;s famous verse anthology the &quot;Golden Treasury&quot; (1861). There was a minor scandal in 1862 when Palgrave was commissioned to write a catalogue for the 1862 International Exhibition, in which he praised Woolner and denigrated other sculptors, especially Woolner&#x27;s main rival Carlo Marochetti. The well known controversialist Jacob Omnium pointed out in a series of letters to the press that the two lived together. William Holman Hunt wrote a reply supporting Woolner, but Palgrave was forced to withdraw the catalogue.
His largest single commission was a programme of architectural sculptures for the Manchester Assize Courts, built in Manchester from 1859 through 1864. Woolner created a large number of statues depicting lawgivers and rulers which formed part of the building&#x27;s structure. Most dramatic was a giant sculpture depicting Moses which was placed on the top, above the entrance. There were also allegorical figures of &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Mercy&quot;. Inside was a relief sculpture depicting the &quot;Judgement of Solomon&quot;, flanked by statues of a &quot;Drunk Woman&quot; and a &quot;Good Woman&quot;. Alfred Waterhouse, the architect, wrote, &quot;we are all delighted with your virtuous woman, and disgusted as we ought to be with the awful example.&quot; The building was bombed during World War II. Some of the sculptures were saved and incorporated into the replacement building.

Woolner made his living mainly from creating statues of famous men, but his most personal and complex works in sculpture were what he called &quot;ideal&quot; groups, notably &quot;Civilization&quot; (1867) and &quot;Virgilia bewailing the absence of Coriolanus&quot; (1871). These demonstrate his attempt to express the tension between the static stone and the dynamic desires of the figures represented emerging into solidity from it. Woolner also made a large number of relief sculptures for memorials. His reliefs depicting scenes from the &quot;Iliad&quot; were widely reproduced. These were intended to commemorate the classical scholarship of William Gladstone.

He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1875 and served as professor of sculpture from 1877 to 1879.

==Personal life==
On 6 September 1864 Woolner married Alice Gertrude Waugh. He had initially been in love with her sister, Fanny, and had previously proposed to her, but she turned him down. Fanny married Woolner&#x27;s Pre-Raphaelite colleague William Holman Hunt the following year, but died in childbirth a year later. In 1874, while in Italy, Hunt married their third sister Edith, an act which Woolner considered immoral and which was defined as incest under British laws at the time. He never spoke to Hunt again.

Hunt&#x27;s granddaughter Diana Holman-Hunt later claimed that before his marriage Woolner had been involved in a relationship with a lower-class girl called Amelia Henderson, who appealed to Hunt for support. Hunt arranged with Frederick Stephens to give her funds to emigrate to Australia so that she would not interfere with Woolner&#x27;s wedding plans.

Woolner and Alice had six children, four daughters and two sons. His eldest child, Amy, later wrote a biography of her father. His two sons Hugh (1866–1925) and Geoffrey (1867–1882) were sent to Marlborough College, where Geoffrey died at the age of 14. Hugh was a survivor of the Titanic disaster and later became a stockbroker.

==Poetry and other work==

Woolner was also a poet of some reputation in his day. His early poem &quot;My Beautiful Lady&quot; is a Pre-Raphaelite work, emphasising intense unresolved moments of feeling. He later expanded it into a full-length work modelled on Tennyson&#x27;s narrative poetry. According to William Michael Rossetti, Coventry Patmore &quot;praised Woolner&#x27;s poems immensely, saying however that they were sometimes slightly over-passionate, and generally &#x27;sculpturesque&#x27; in character&quot;. By this, he meant that &quot;each stanza was a separate unit&quot;.

In the 1880s he wrote three long narrative works, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, &quot;Silenus&quot; and &quot;Tiresias&quot;. These renounce Pre-Raphaelitism in favour of an often eroticised classicism. The first describes the sculptor Pygmalion&#x27;s efforts to create a more realistic form of art. He battles against a group called &quot;The Archaics&quot;. The second describes the love affair between Silenus and the nymph Syrinx. After her death at the hands of Pan, Silenus becomes an obese alcoholic, but acquires prophetic powers. A vision of the goddess Athena restores him to emotional stability. In &quot;Tiresias&quot; the blind sage recalls his long life; in a visionary pantheism, he demonstrates his power to understand the language of birds and enter into the experiences of all living things and natural forces.

Woolner was a close friend of a number of writers of the day, notably Thomas Carlyle and Alfred Tennyson. He provided the latter with the scenario for his poem &quot;Enoch Arden&quot;.

He also corresponded with Charles Darwin, who named part of the human ear the &#x27;Woolnerian Tip&#x27; after a feature in Woolner&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Puck&quot;. Woolner had discussed the feature when Darwin had been sitting to him for a portrait. Darwin later sought his views when preparing his 1872 book &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;.

Thomas Woolner died instantly from a stroke at the age of 66. He was buried in St Mary’s churchyard, Hendon. The kerb around his grave has a sculptor’s mallet and tools carved into it. Buried within St Mary’s Church itself is Sir Stamford Raffles, whose statue he sculpted. His wife Alice died in 1912. Their son, Hugh, travelled back to his home in New York from her funeral on the . He survived the sinking of the ship.

<text>The is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console manufactured and developed by Sega. It was originally a remodeled export version of the Sega Mark III, the third iteration of the SG-1000 series of consoles, which was released in Japan in 1985 with improved graphical capabilities compared to its predecessors. The Master System launched in North America in 1986, followed by Europe in 1987, and then in Brazil and Korea in 1989. A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987, which features a few enhancements over the export models (and by proxy the original Mark III): a built-in FM audio chip, a rapid-fire switch, and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses. The Master System II, a cheaper model, was released in 1990 in North America, Australasia, and Europe.

The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards. Accessories include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with specially designed games. The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot, turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system, and is incompatible with the 3D glasses.

The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES, due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity. Though the Master System had newer, improved hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo&#x27;s significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly greater success in other markets, including Europe, Brazil, South Korea, and Australia.

The Master System is estimated to have sold between 10-13 million units worldwide. In addition, Tectoy has sold licensed Master System variants in Brazil. Retrospective criticism has recognized its role in the development of the Sega Genesis, and a number of well-received games, particularly in PAL (including PAL-M) regions, but is critical of its limited library in the NTSC regions, which were dominated by the NES.

==History==
=== Mark III ===
On July 15, 1983, Sega released its first video game console, the SG-1000, in Japan. The launch coincided with the same day its competitor Nintendo launched the Famicom. In 1984, parent company Gulf and Western Industries divested its non-core businesses including Sega, and Sega president Hayao Nakayama was installed as CEO. Sega released another console, the SG-1000 II, featuring several hardware alterations, including detachable controllers. Nakayama and Sega co-founder David Rosen arranged a management buyout with financial backing from CSK Corporation and installed CSK CEO Isao Okawa as chairman.

Hoping to better compete with Nintendo, Sega released another console, the Sega Mark III, in Japan in 1985. The Mark III was a redesigned version of the SG-1000. It was engineered by the same team, including Hideki Sato and Masami Ishikawa, who had worked on the SG-1000 II and later led development of the Sega Genesis. According to Sato, the console was redesigned because of the limitations of the Texas Instruments TMS9918A graphics chip in the SG-1000, which did not have the power for the kinds of games Sega wanted to make. The Mark III&#x27;s chip was designed in-house, based around the unit in Sega&#x27;s System 2 arcade system board.

The Sega Mark III was released in Japan on October 20, 1985 at ¥15,000. Though its hardware was more powerful than the Famicom, the Mark III was not successful on launch. Problems arose from Nintendo&#x27;s licensing practices with third-party developers, whereby Nintendo required that games for the Famicom not be published on other consoles. Sega developed its own games and obtained the rights to port games from other developers, but they did not sell well.

=== North American release as Master System ===

Though the SG-1000 had not been released in the United States, Sega hoped that their video game console business would fare better in North America than it had in Japan. To accomplish this, Sega of America was established in 1986 to manage the company&#x27;s consumer products in North America. Rosen and Nakayama hired Bruce Lowry, Nintendo of America&#x27;s vice president of sales. Lowry was persuaded to change companies because Sega would allow him to start his new office in San Francisco. He chose the name &quot;Sega of America&quot; for his division because he had worked for Nintendo of America and liked the combination of words. Initially, Sega of America was tasked with repackaging the Mark III for a Western release. Sega of America rebranded the Mark III as the Master System, similar to Nintendo&#x27;s reworking of the Famicom into the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The name was chosen by Sega of America employees throwing darts against a whiteboard of suggested names. Plans to release a cheaper console, the Base System, also influenced the decision. Okawa approved of the name after being told it was a reference to the competitive nature of both the video game industry and martial arts, in which only one competitor can be the &quot;Master&quot;. The console&#x27;s futuristic final design was intended to appeal to Western tastes. The North American packaging was white to differentiate it from the black NES packaging, with a white grid design inspired by Apple computer products.

The Master System was first revealed in North America at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago in June 1986. It was initially sold in a package with the &quot;Power Base&quot; console, a light gun, two controllers, and a pack-in multicart. The console was launched in September 1986 at a price of $200 (), including the games &quot;Hang-On&quot; and &quot;Safari Hunt&quot;. Nintendo was exporting the Famicom to the US as the NES, and both companies planned to spend $15 million in late 1986 to market their consoles; Sega hoped to sell 400,000 to 750,000 consoles in 1986. By the end of 1986, at least 125,000 Master System consoles had been sold, more than the Atari 7800&#x27;s 100,000 but less than Nintendo&#x27;s 1.1 million. Other sources indicate that more than 250,000 Master System consoles were sold by Christmas 1986.

As in Japan, the Master System in North America had a limited game library. Limited by Nintendo&#x27;s licensing practices, Sega only had two third-party American publishers, Activision and Parker Brothers. Agreements with both of those companies came to an end in 1989. Sega claimed that the Master System was the first console &quot;where the graphics on the box are actually matched by the graphics of the game&quot;, and pushed the &quot;arcade experience&quot; in adverts. Its marketing department was run by only two people, giving Sega a disadvantage in advertising. As one method of promoting the console, at the end of 1987 Sega partnered with astronaut Scott Carpenter to start the &quot;Sega Challenge&quot;, a traveling program set up in recreational centers where kids were tested on non-verbal skills such as concentration and the ability to learn new skills. &quot;Out Run&quot; and &quot;Shooting Gallery&quot; were two games included in the challenge.

In 1987, amid struggling sales in the US, Sega sold the US distribution rights for the Master System to the toy company Tonka, which had no experience with electronic entertainment systems. The thinking at Sega behind the deal was to leverage Tonka&#x27;s knowledge of the American toy market, since Nintendo had marketed the NES as a toy to great success in the region. The announcement was made shortly after the 1987 Summer CES. During this time, much of Sega of America&#x27;s infrastructure shifted from marketing and distribution to focus on customer service, and Lowry departed the company. Tonka blocked localization of several popular Japanese games, and during 1988 were less willing to purchase EPROMs needed for game cartridge manufacture during a shortage. They also became less willing to invest in video games after taking massive loans in purchasing Kenner Toys in 1987, followed by poor holiday season sales and financial losses. Though the distributor of the console had changed, the Master System continued to perform poorly in the market.

The Mark III was rereleased as the Master System in Japan on October 18, 1987 for ¥16,800, but still sold poorly. Neither model posed a serious challenge to Nintendo in Japan, and, according to Sato, Sega was only able to attain 10% of the Japanese console market.

=== Europe, Brazil, and other markets ===
The Master System was launched in Europe in August 1987. It was distributed by Mastertronic in the United Kingdom, Master Games in France, and Ariolasoft in West Germany, though Ariolasoft initially purchased the distribution rights for the United Kingdom. Because Ariolasoft could not agree to a pricing agreement with Sega, Mastertronic signed a deal in 1987 to take control of UK distribution, and announced the deal at the 1987 Summer CES. The company announced the release of 12 titles by autumn. Mastertronic advertised the Master System as &quot;an arcade in the home&quot; and launched it at £99 (). Advance orders from retailers were high, but Sega proved unable to deliver inventory until Boxing Day on December 26, causing many retailers to cancel their orders; Mastertronic and Master Games entered financial crises and Ariolasoft vowed never to work with Sega again. Mastertronic had already sold a minority interest to the Virgin Group to enter the console business, and sold the remainder to avoid bankruptcy. The newly rebranded Virgin Mastertronic took over all European distribution in 1988.

Virgin Mastertronic focused marketing the Master System on ports of Sega&#x27;s arcade games and positioning it as a superior video game alternative to the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum computers. As a result of this marketing and of Nintendo&#x27;s less effective early approaches in Europe, the Master System began to attract European developers. The Master System held a significant part of the video game console market in Europe through the release of Sega&#x27;s succeeding console, the Mega Drive. In 1989, Virgin Mastertronic began offering rentals of the Master System console and 20 games. The United Kingdom also hosted a Sega video games national championship, with the winner competing against Japanese and American champions on the British television show &quot;Motormouth&quot;. Players competed in a variety of games, including &quot;Astro Warrior&quot;, platform games, and sports games. During the late 1980s, the Master System was outselling the NES in the United Kingdom.

The Master System was successful in Europe. By 1990, the Master System was the best-selling console in Europe, though the NES was beginning to have a fast-growing user base in the UK. For the year 1990, Virgin Mastertronic sold 150,000 Master Systems in the United Kingdom, greater than the 60,000 Mega Drives and Nintendo&#x27;s 80,000 consoles sold in the same period. In the whole of Europe that year, Sega sold a combined 918,000 consoles, greater than Nintendo&#x27;s 655,000.

The Master System was also successful in Brazil, where it was distributed by Tectoy and launched in September 1989. Tectoy, a Brazilian toy company startup focused on electronic toys, reached out to Sega about distributing their products. Despite hesitation given the situation with Tonka in the US, Tectoy was eventually given liberty to manage Sega products in Brazil. Their success distributing Sega&#x27;s laser tag gun based on the anime &quot;Zillion&quot; gave Sega the confidence to allow Tectoy to distribute the Master System. By the end of 1990, the installed base in Brazil was about 280,000 units. Tectoy introduced a telephone service with game tips, created a Master System club, and presented the program &quot;Master Tips&quot; during commercial breaks of the television show &quot;Sessão Aventura&quot; of Rede Globo. Nintendo did not arrive in Brazil until 1993, and were unable to officially compete, given that clones of the NES dominated the Brazilian market. Tectoy claimed 80% of the Brazilian video game market.

In South Korea, the Sega Mark III was released by Samsung under the name &quot;Gam*Boy&quot; in April 1989 and then the Master System II was released under the name &quot;Aladdin Boy&quot; in 1992. It sold 720,000 units in South Korea up until 1993, outselling the NES (released by Hyundai Group as the &quot;Comboy&quot;) and becoming the best-selling console in South Korea up until 1993. The Master System was also popular in Australia, where 250,000 units were sold in 1990 alone, and where it was more successful than the NES. 650,000 Master System consoles had been sold in Australia by November 1994.

=== Decline ===

Although the Master System was a success in Europe, and later in Brazil, it failed to ignite significant interest in the Japanese or North American markets, which, by the mid-to-late 1980s, were both dominated by Nintendo. By 1988, Nintendo held 83 percent of the North American video game market. With Sega continuing to have difficulty penetrating the home market, Sega&#x27;s console R&amp;D team, led by Ishikawa and supervised by Sato, began work on a successor to the Master System almost immediately after its launch. Another competitor arose in Japan in 1987 when Japanese computer giant NEC released the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16 in North America) amid great publicity.

Sega released its next console, the 16-bit Mega Drive, in Japan on October 29, 1988. The final licensed release for the Master System in Japan was &quot;Bomber Raid&quot; in 1989. In the same year, Sega was preparing to release the new Mega Drive, rebranded Genesis, in North America. Displeased with Tonka&#x27;s handling of the Master System, Sega reacquired the marketing and distribution rights to the Master System for the United States. In 1990, Sega released the remodeled Master System II, designed as a lower-cost version without the Sega Card slot. Sega promoted the new model, but it sold poorly. By early 1992, Master System production had ceased in North America, having sold between 1.5 million and 2 million units, behind both Nintendo and Atari, which controlled 80 percent and 12 percent of the market respectively. The last licensed Master System release in North America was &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991).

In Europe, where the Master System was the best-selling console up until 1990, the NES caught up with and narrowly overtook the Master System in Western Europe during the early 1990s, though the Master System maintained its lead in several markets such as the United Kingdom, Belgium and Spain. In 1993, the Master System&#x27;s estimated active installed user base in Europe was 6.25 million units, larger than that of the Mega Drive&#x27;s 5.73 million that year but less than the NES&#x27;s 7.26 million. Combined with the Mega Drive, Sega represented the majority of the European console market that year. The Master System II was also successful and helped Sega to sustain their significant market share. Releases continued into the 1990s in Europe, including &quot;Mercs&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (both 1992), and &quot;Streets of Rage 2&quot; (1994).

The Master System has had continued success in Brazil, where dedicated &quot;plug and play&quot; consoles emulating the original hardware continue to be sold by Tectoy, including portable versions. These systems include the Master System Compact and the Master System III, and Tectoy has also received requests to remake the original Master System. A 2012 article on UOL wrote that Tectoy re-releases of the Master System and Mega Drive combined sold around 150,000 units per year in Brazil. By 2016, Tectoy said they had sold 8 million units of Master System branded systems in Brazil.

==Technical specifications==
The Master System&#x27;s main CPU is an 8-bit Zilog Z80A rated for 4 MHz, but runs at 3.58 MHz. It has 8 KB of ROM, 8 KB of RAM and 16 KB of video RAM (VRAM). Video is provided through an RF switch (though Model 1s with an AV port can also output composite and even RGB video) and displays at a resolution of 256 × 192 pixels and up to 32 colors at one time from a total palette of 64 colors; the Video Display Processor (VDP) graphics chip was designed by Sega for the Mark III. The Master System measures , while the Mark III measures . Both consoles use two slots for game input: one for Mega Cartridges and one for Sega Cards, along with an expansion slot and two controller ports. Sound is provided by the Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG built into the VDP, which can provide three square wave channels and one noise channel. The Japanese version also integrates the Yamaha YM2413 FM chip, an optional feature on the Mark III. With few exceptions, Master System hardware is identical to the hardware in the Mark III. Games for the console are playable on the Sega Genesis using the Power Base Converter accessory, and on the Game Gear using the Master Gear Converter. Compared to the base NES, the Master System has four times as much system memory, eight times as much video memory, and a higher CPU clock rate.

Sega produced several iterations of the Master System. The Master System II, released in 1990, removed a number of components to reduce cost: the Sega Card slot, reset button, power light, expansion port, and startup music and logo. In most regions, the Master System II&#x27;s A/V port was omitted, leaving only RF output available; this was reversed in France, where the local version of the Master System II had only A/V video output available and omitted the RF hardware. In Brazil, Tectoy released several licensed variations; the Master System Super Compact functions wirelessly with an RF transmitter, and the Master System Girl, molded in bright pink plastic, was targeted at girls. The Master System 3 Collection, released in 2006, contains 120 built-in games. Handheld versions of the Master System were released under several brands, such as Coleco in 2006.

=== Accessories ===

A number of cross-compatible accessories were created for the Mark III and Master System. The controller consists of a rectangle with a D-pad and two buttons. Sega also introduced additional Mark III controllers, such as a paddle controller. A combination steering wheel and flight stick, the Handle Controller, was released in 1989. The Sega Control Stick is an arcade-style joystick with the buttons on the opposite side as the standard controller. Unreleased in Europe, the Sega Sports Pad utilizes a trackball and is compatible with three games. Sega also created an expansion for its controller, the Rapid Fire Unit, that allows for auto-fire by holding down one of two buttons. This unit connects between the console and the controller. A light gun peripheral, the Light Phaser, was based on the weapon of the same name from the Japanese anime &quot;Zillion&quot;. It is compatible with 13 games and released exclusively in the West.

A pair of 3D glasses, the SegaScope 3-D, were created for games such as &quot;Space Harrier 3-D&quot;, although Mark III users need an additional converter to use them. The SegaScope 3-D works via an active shutter 3D system, creating a stereoscopic effect. The glasses need to be connected to the Sega Card slot, and thus do not function with the Master System II due to lack of the card slot. A total of eight games, including &quot;Zaxxon 3-D&quot; and &quot;OutRun 3-D&quot;, are compatible with the glasses.

The Mark III has an optional RF transmitter accessory, allowing wireless play that broadcasts the game being played on a UHF television signal.

===Game Gear===
Developed under the name &quot;Project Mercury&quot; and designed based on the Master System&#x27;s hardware, the Game Gear is a handheld game console. It was first released in Japan on October 6, 1990, in North America and Europe in 1991, and in Australia and New Zealand in 1992. Originally retailing at JP¥19,800 in Japan, $149.99 in North America, and £99.99 in the United Kingdom, the Game Gear was designed to compete with the Game Boy, which Nintendo had released in 1989. There are similarities between the Game Gear and the Master System hardware, but the games are not directly compatible; Master System games are only playable on Game Gear using the Master Gear Converter accessory. A large part of the Game Gear&#x27;s game library consists of Master System ports. Because of hardware similarities, including the landscape screen orientation, Master System games are easily portable to the handheld. In particular, many Master System ports of Game Gear games were done by Tectoy for the Brazilian market, as the Master System was more popular than the Game Gear in the region.

==Game library==


Master System games came in two formats: ROM cartridges held up to 4 Mbit (512 KB) of code and data, while Sega Cards held up to 256 Kbit (32 KB). Cartridges were marketed by their storage size: One Mega (1 Mbit), Two Mega (2 Mbit), and Four Mega (4 Mbit). Cards, cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges, included &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; and &quot;Super Tennis&quot;, but were eventually dropped due to their small memory size. The size of the release library varies based on region; North America received just over 100 games, with Japan receiving less. Europe, by contrast, received over 300 licensed games, including 8-bit ports of Genesis games and PAL-exclusive releases. The first Mark III-specific cartridge was &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot;, released on June 15, 1986, and &quot;Bomber Raid&quot; was the final release on February 4, 1989, a few months after the launch of the Mega Drive. The final North American release was &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; in October 1991. Games for PAL regions continued to be released until the mid-1990s.

The Sega Mark III and the Japanese Master System are backwards-compatible with SC-3000/SG-1000 cartridges, and can play Sega Card games without the Card Catcher peripheral. However, educational and programming cartridges for the SC-3000 require the SK-1100 keyboard peripheral, which is compatible with the Mark III but not the Japanese Master System. Mark III-specific games were initially available in card format (labelled My Card Mark III to distinguish themselves from games designed for the SC-3000/SG-1000), starting with &quot;Teddy Boy Blues&quot; and &quot;Hang-On&quot;, both released on October 20, 1985.

Of the games released for the Master System, &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; is considered a benchmark role-playing game (RPG), and became a successful franchise. Sega&#x27;s flagship character at the time, Alex Kidd, was featured in games including &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot;. &quot;Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap&quot; was influential for its blend of platform gameplay with RPG elements. Different Master System consoles included built-in games, including &quot;Snail Maze,&quot; &quot;Hang-On&quot;/&quot;Safari Hunt&quot;, &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Battery-backup save game support was included in eight cartridges, including &quot;Penguin Land&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, &quot;Ys&quot;, and &quot;Miracle Warriors&quot;.

The more extensive PAL region library includes 8-bit entries in Genesis franchises such as &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;, a number of additional &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games, and dozens of PAL exclusives such as &quot;The Lucky Dime Caper Starring Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;Asterix&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Master of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;Power Strike II&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;&#x27;s Damien McFerran praised the &quot;superb&quot; PAL library of &quot;interesting ports and excellent exclusives&quot;, which was richer than the North American library and provided a &quot;drip-feed of quality titles&quot;.

After the Master System was discontinued in other markets, additional games were released in Brazil by Tectoy, including ports of &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot; and &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;. Tectoy created Portuguese translations of games exclusive to the region. Some of these would tie in to popular Brazilian entertainment franchises; for example, &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; became &quot;Geraldinho&quot;, certain &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; titles became &quot;Monica&#x27;s Gang&quot; games, and &quot;Ghost House&quot; became &quot;Chapolim vs. Dracula: Um Duelo Assutador&quot;, based on the Mexican TV series &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;. Tectoy also ported games to the Master System, including various games from the Genesis and Game Gear. Aside from porting, the company developed &quot;Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau&quot; after finding out that Woody Woodpecker (named Pica-Pau in Portuguese) was the most popular cartoon on Brazilian television, along with at least twenty additional exclusives. These titles were developed in-house by Tectoy in Brazil.

Due in part to Nintendo&#x27;s licensing practices, which stipulated that third-party NES developers could not release games on other platforms, few third-party developers released games for the Master System. According to Sato, Sega was focused on porting its arcade games instead of building relationships with third parties. According to Sega designer Mark Cerny, most of Sega&#x27;s early Master System games were developed within a strict three-month deadline, which affected their quality. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; compared new Sega games to &quot;drops of water in the desert&quot;. Games for the Master System took advantage of more advanced hardware compared to the NES; &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot;, for example, showcases &quot;blistering colors and more detailed sprites&quot; than NES games. The Master System version of &quot;R-Type&quot; was praised for its visuals, comparable to those of the TurboGrafx-16 port.

In 2005, Sega reached a deal with the company AtGames to release emulated Master System software in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. Several Master System games were released for download on Nintendo&#x27;s Wii Virtual Console, beginning with &quot;Hokuto no Ken&quot; in 2008 in Japan and &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; in North America. Master System games were also released via the GameTap online service.

==Reception and legacy==
Due to the continued release of new variants in Brazil, the Master System is considered by many video gaming publications to be the longest lived gaming console in video games history, a title it took from the Atari 2600. Sales of the Master System have been estimated between 10 million and 13 million units, not including later Brazil sales. It saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America. In 1989, the Master System was listed in the top 20 products of NPD Group&#x27;s Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service. However, the &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; 1992 Buyer&#x27;s Guide indicated a souring interest in the console. Four reviewers scored it 5, 4, 5, and 5 out of a possible 10 points each, focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality games for the Master System. In 1993, reviewers scored it 2, 2, 3, and 3 out of 10, noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases. By contrast, over 34 million NES units were sold in North America alone, outselling the Master System&#x27;s life time units globally nearly three times over. According to Bill Pearse of &quot;Playthings&quot;, the NES gained an advantage through better software and more recognizable characters. Sega closed the gap with Nintendo in the next generation with the release of the Genesis, which sold 30.75 million consoles compared with the 49 million Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles.

Retrospective feedback of the Master System praises its support toward development of the Sega Genesis, but has been critical of its small game library. Writing for &quot;AllGame&quot;, Dave Beuscher noted that the Master System &quot;was doomed by the lack of third-party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by 1992.&quot; &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; writer Adam Buchanan praised the larger PAL library as a &quot;superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives&quot;. Damien McFerran, also of &quot;Retro Gamer,&quot; recognized its importance to the success of the Genesis, stating, &quot;Without this criminally undervalued machine, Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive. The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions, original IP and even create a mascot in the form of the lovable monkey-boy Alex Kidd.&quot; In 2009, the Master System was named the 20th best console of all time by &quot;IGN&quot;, behind the Atari 7800 (17th) and the NES (1st). &quot;IGN&quot; cited the Master System&#x27;s small and uneven NTSC library as the major problems: &quot;Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the Master System feel even more painful.&quot;

<text>Constructor University, formerly Jacobs University Bremen, is an international, private, residential research university located in Vegesack, Bremen, Germany. It offers study programs in engineering, humanities, natural and social sciences, in which students can acquire bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s or doctorate degrees. 

Most of the instruction at the university is in English. Constructor University&#x27;s students come from more than 110 countries, with about 80% foreign students and approximately 33% international faculty members.

== History ==
Constructor University (previously called Jacobs University and International University Bremen) was founded in 1999 with the support of the University of Bremen, Rice University in Houston, Texas, and the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, with study programs beginning in 2001. The Jacobs Foundation invested €200 million in the institution in November 2006, thus taking over a two-thirds majority of the partnership share. At the beginning of 2007, the university changed its name to Jacobs University Bremen. In November 2022 it changed its name to Constructor University.

The campus is located on the site of the former Roland Barracks in Bremen-Grohn. The site was erected in 1938 during the National Socialist period. After the Second World War, it was transformed into a displaced-persons camp by the International Refugee Organization under the management of the American forces known as Camp Grohn. Shortly after the formation of the Bundeswehr, Camp Grohn was passed into the responsibility of the German government in 1955 and renamed &quot;Roland Kaserne&quot;. Roland Kaserne housed a Bundeswehr logistics school during the Cold War. In 1999, the military base was inactivated, making way for the university.

The approximately 34-hectare site of the campus university is home to four residential colleges, buildings for administration, lecturing and research, an Information Resource Center (IRC) with a library and digital resources, sport, leisure and park facilities.

== Financing ==
The financing of Constructor University has been the subject of controversy, especially in Bremen. For a long time, the university generated income from various sources such as tuition fees, donations, third-party funding and grants from the Jacobs Foundation. Funding from the state of Bremen, amounting to three million euros annually, expired in 2017.

In June 2018, the Jacobs Foundation decided to support the private university with a maximum of another 100 million Swiss francs until 2027. Also in June 2018, the city of Bremen decided that it would take over a loan from the university&#x27;s founding phase.

In the summer of 2020, the Jacobs Foundation announced its withdrawal from funding. The foundation&#x27;s majority shares were transferred to the Verein zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung in Bremen e.V.

In September 2021, the Bremen Senate approved the sale of Bremen&#x27;s shares to the Schaffhausen Institute of Technology (SIT). The new majority owner plans to invest 50 million euros in Jacobs University, half of which by the end of 2024. 
In November 2022 SIT changed its name to Constructor Group.

== Organization ==

The university is managed by a not-for-profit company &quot;Constructor University Bremen gGmbH&quot;. In line with the statutes, it is composed of four organs: the councilors, the board of trustees, the board of governors and the executive board, which comprises the managing director and the president. The board of governors is the central decision-making committee for all the fundamental questions of the university&#x27;s development, including the appointment of the president and the professors. Christian Jacobs, the eldest son of the entrepreneur and patron Klaus J. Jacobs (1936–2008), is a member of the board of trustees of the Jacobs Foundation.

The president of the Alumni Association is also a member of the board of governors, thus taking a very active role in shaping the future of the institution.

== Categorization of the study model ==
Constructor University has combined features of typical US and German higher education institutions.

US universities can be public or private and typically offer 4-year undergraduate programs. They charge high annual tuition fees and provide accommodation for students to live on campus. In contrast, most German universities are public and offer 3-year undergraduate programs in accordance with the Bologna Process. The majority of German universities does not charge tuition fees, but only collect a small service fee. Dormitories and meals are managed by Studentenwerk, a municipal student service organization independent of universities. Constructor, as a private university, offers 3-year undergraduate programs with less expensive tuition fees and provides accommodation on the residential campus for its student.

A typical 4-year US program includes physical education, requiring students to take around four to five courses per semester. Like German universities, Constructor&quot;&quot;&#x27;s 3-year undergraduate program offers athletics in the form of extracurricular activities. The average 30 ECTS per semester include more than 6 courses of soft skills training (e.g. language courses as additional competencies). Constructor University also provides career advising.

The admission process of Constructor University follows the US-American system.

== Cooperation with businesses ==
Constructor University offers companies various opportunities for cooperation, which include long-term research collaborations, the provision of scientific services as part of short-term research and development projects, or training of junior and managerial staff.

== Cyber Security Incident ==

In early February, Constructor University grappled with a cyber security breach, resulting in a week-long campus-wide internet blackout. While no data compromise was reported, functionality was only partially restored by late March. The incident&#x27;s impact extended to essential services like the meal plan system, highlighting the crucial role of robust cyber security protocols in safeguarding educational institutions.

<text>Antonius Johannes Geesink (6 April 1934 – 27 August 2010) was a Dutch 10th dan judoka. He was the first non-Japanese judoka to win gold at the World Judo Championships, a feat he accomplished in 1961 and 1965. He was also an Olympic Champion, having won gold at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Japan, and won a record 21 European Judo Championships during his career.

==Judo career==

Geesink took up judo at age 14 and, by 17, started competing internationally, winning a silver medal in 1951. He won his first European title the following year. Through to 1967, twenty more European titles followed.

At the 1956 World Championships, Geesink was eliminated in the semi-finals against Yoshihiko Yoshimatsu. At the 1961 World Championships, Geesink, then 5th dan, became World Champion in the open class, defeating the Japanese champion Koji Sone. Japanese judokas had won all the World Championship titles contested up to that point.

Judo debuted as an official sport at the 1964 Summer Olympics, held in the sport&#x27;s home country, Japan. Although Japan dominated three of the four weight divisions (light, middle, and heavy), Anton Geesink won the final of the open weight division, defeating Akio Kaminaga in front of his home crowd.

After winning the 1965 World Championships and a last European title in 1967, Geesink quit competitive judo.

Anton Geesink was one of the few 10th Dan grade judoka (jūdan) recognized by the IJF but not by Kodokan at that rank. Promotions from 6th to 10th Dan are awarded for services to the sport of judo. In 2010 there are three living 10th dan grade judoka (jūdan) recognized by Kodokan: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe and Yoshimi Osawa. The Kodokan has not awarded the 10th Dan to anybody outside Japan.

==Professional wrestling career==
In October 1973, &quot;All Japan Pro Wrestling&quot; owner Giant Baba recruited Anton Geesink to join AJPW. Baba sent him to Amarillo, TX, and Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk trained him for a month. As a popular part-timer, he worked for &quot;All Japan&quot; from 1973 to 1978.

Geesink&#x27;s notable professional wrestling opponents included Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon, Dick Murdoch, Dory Funk Jr., Bobby Duncum, Bob Remus (Sgt. Slaughter), Don Leo Jonathan, and Jumbo Tsuruta.

==Films and publications==

Geesink made his acting debut in 1962, playing a detective in the Dutch film &quot;Rififi in Amsterdam&quot;. In 1965, he starred as Samson in the Italian historical film &quot;Gideon and Samson: Great Leaders of the Bible&quot;, and in the 1960s-1980s, he took part in three Dutch TV series, including the children&#x27;s show Oebele, where he also sang the song &quot;Judo rock&quot;. In the 1960s he published several books on judo in Dutch and English.

==International Olympic Committee work==
In 1986 during the Maastricht IJF DC meeting Geesink proposed that one player should wear a blue Judogi.

In 1987, Geesink became a member of the board of the Dutch National Olympic Committee, and a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Geesink was among the IOC members suspected of accepting bribes during the scandal surrounding the election of Salt Lake City as the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Geesink&#x27;s name was cleared by the IOC which nevertheless issued him a warning for the appearance of a conflict of interest which could have damaged the reputation of the IOC. Geesink continued working for IOC until his death in 2010.

==Personal life and death==

Geesink was born and raised in Utrecht. His family was poor and he started work as a builder aged 12. He died in 2010 aged 76 in the town of his birth. He was survived by Jans Geesink, his wife of more than 50 years; his sons Willy and Anton Jr.; and daughter, Leni.

==Honours==

Geesink was chosen as the Dutch Sportsman of the Year in 1957, 1961, 1964 and 1965. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government in 1997.

His home town of Utrecht has a street named after him — which is the street he lived on for some time up until his death in August 2010. On 29 January 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Kokushikan University, a Japanese university known for its sport education and of which four alumni are Olympic gold medalists in judo, with the following praise:
ヘーシンク氏は、一九六四年東京オリンピックにおいて、柔道無差別級で外国人選手として初めて金メダルを獲得し、その後、武道精神をもって国際平和に貢献するとともにオランダ・日本両国民の文化交流・友好関係の促進に努め、また柔道を教育学や生体学的角度から研究し、その普及発展のために尽力された。
武道の精神を重視する本大学は、柔道の国際的普及における同氏の功績を讃え、国士舘大学名誉博士の学位を贈呈した。

At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Mr. Geesink won the gold medal in the open class as the first non-Japanese. Since then, with the spirit of budō, he has contributed to the international peace and promoted the cultural exchange and friendship between the people of the Netherlands and of Japan. Furthermore, he explored judo in light of education and somatology and has been devoted to its diffusion and development. To honor his contribution to the worldwide diffusion of judo, this university, as a body which prizes the spirit of budō, awarded him an honorary doctorate of Kokushikan University.

<text>A game controller, gaming controller, or simply controller, is an input device or input/output device used with video games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mice, gamepads, and joysticks, as well as special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games. Controllers designs have evolved to include directional pads, multiple buttons, analog sticks, joysticks, motion detection, touch screens and a plethora of other features.

Game controllers may be input devices that only provide input to the system, or input/output devices that receive data from the system and produce a response (e.g. &quot;rumble&quot; vibration feedback, or sound).

Controllers which are included with the purchase of a home console are referred to as standard controllers, while those that are available to purchase from the console manufacturer or third-party offerings are considered peripheral controllers.

== History ==

One of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;. Controllers have since evolved to include directional pads, multiple buttons, analog sticks, joysticks, motion detection, touch screens and a plethora of other features.

Game controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The Microsoft Xbox controller, with its &quot;shoulder triggers&quot; that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for shooting games.

Before the seventh generation of video game consoles, plugging in a controller into one of a console&#x27;s controller ports was the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are battery-powered. USB game controllers could also be connected to a computer with a USB port.

== Variants ==
Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, and joysticks. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers. Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game, such as steering wheels for driving games, or dance pads for dancing games.

A gamepad, also known as a joypad, is held in both hands with thumbs and fingers used to provide input. Gamepads can have a number of action buttons combined with one or more omnidirectional control sticks or buttons. Action buttons are generally handled with the digits on the right hand, and the directional input handled with the left. Gamepads are the primary means of input on most modern video game consoles. Due to the ease of use and user-friendly nature of gamepads, they have spread from their origin on traditional consoles to personal computers, where a variety of games and emulators support their input as a replacement for keyboard and mouse input. Most modern game controllers are a variation of a standard gamepad. Common additions include shoulder buttons placed along the edges of the pad, centrally placed buttons labeled &quot;start&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, and &quot;mode&quot;, and an internal motor to provide haptic feedback.

As modern game controllers advance, so too do their user ability qualities. Typically, the controllers become smaller and more compact to more easily, and comfortably, fit within the user&#x27;s hand. Modern examples can be drawn from systems such as the first Xbox console, whose controller has changed in a variety of ways from the original Xbox 360 controller to the Xbox One controller introduced in 2013.

=== Paddle ===
A paddle is a controller that features a round wheel and one or more fire buttons. The wheel is typically used to control movement of the player or of an object along one axis of the video screen. As the user turns the wheel further from the default position, the speed of control in the game become more intensive.

Paddle controllers were the first analog controllers and they lost popularity when &quot;paddle and ball&quot; type games fell out of favor. A variation, the Atari driving controller, appeared on the Atari 2600. Designed specifically for the game &quot;Indy 500&quot;, it functioned almost identically in operation and design to the regular paddle controller. The exceptions were that its wheel could be continuously rotated in either direction, and that it was missing the extra paddle included on the previous model. Unlike a spinner, friction prevented the wheel from gaining momentum.

=== Joystick ===
A joystick is a peripheral that consists of a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for flight simulators. HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) controllers, composed of a joystick and throttle quadrant (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees.

Most joysticks are designed to be operated with the user&#x27;s primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. Arcade controllers are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed.

=== Trackball ===

A trackball is a smooth sphere that is manipulated with the palm of one&#x27;s hand. The user can roll the ball in any direction to control the cursor. It has the advantage that it can be faster than a mouse depending on the speed of rotation of the physical ball. Another advantage is that it requires less space than a mouse, which the trackball was a precursor of. Notable uses of a Trackball as a gaming controller would be games such as &quot;Centipede&quot;, &quot;Marble Madness&quot;, &quot;Golden Tee Golf&quot; and &quot;SegaSonic the Hedgehog&quot;.

=== Throttle quadrant ===
A throttle quadrant is a set of one or more throttle levers that are most often used to simulate throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation.

=== Steering wheel ===
A racing wheel, essentially a larger version of a paddle, is used in most racing arcade games as well as more recent racing simulators such as &quot;Live for Speed&quot;, &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot;, &quot;GTR2&quot;, and &quot;Richard Burns Rally&quot;. While most arcade racing games have been using steering wheels since &quot;Gran Trak 10&quot; in 1974, steering wheels for home systems appeared on fifth-generation consoles such as the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Many are force feedback (see Force Feedback Wheel), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Some wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but higher-tier models can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock, or more. The Namco Jogcon paddle was available for the PlayStation game &quot;R4: Ridge Racer Type 4&quot;. Unlike &quot;real&quot; video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player&#x27;s hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a soda can&#x27;s) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some VCRs. The Wii game &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; is bundled with the Wii Wheel: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the Wii Remote is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote&#x27;s motion sensing capabilities to control the kart during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the Nintendo 3DS game &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot;. When the steering wheel is placed on the back of the console, then it will have the same ability as in &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; by using the gyroscope in first-person mode.

=== Yoke ===
A yoke is very similar to a steering wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Some flight simulator sets that include yokes also come with various other aircraft controls such as throttle quadrants and pedals. These sets, including the yoke, are intended to be used in a flight simulator.

=== Pedals ===
Pedals may be used for driving simulations or flight simulations and often ships with a steering-wheel-type input device. In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals. There are also variations of the pedal controller such as the proposed rotating pedal device for a cycling game, which relies on an ergometer to generate user inputs such as pedal rpm and pedal resistance. A variation of this concept surfaced in 2016 when a startup called VirZoom debuted a set of sensors that can be installed in the pedal and handlebars, turning a physical bike into one controller for games on the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) platforms. The same concept is behind a product called Cyber ExerCycle, which is a set of sensors attached to the pedal and connected to the PC via USB for bicycle simulation games such as NetAthlon and Fuel.

=== Mouse and keyboard ===
A mouse and computer keyboard are typical input devices for a personal computer and are currently the main game controllers for computer games. The mouse is often used with a mousepad to achieve greater speed, comfort, accuracy and smoother movement for the gamer. Some video game consoles also have the ability to function with a keyboard and a mouse. The computer keyboard is modelled after the typewriter keyboard and was designed for the input of written text. A mouse is a handheld pointing device used in addition to the keyboard. For games, the keyboard typically controls movement of the character while the mouse is used to control the game camera or used for aiming. While originally designed for general computer input, there are several keyboard and mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming, often with gaming-specific functions built-in. Examples include peripherals by Razer, the &quot;Zboard&quot; range of keyboards and Logitech&#x27;s &#x27;G&#x27; series. The numeric keypad found on the keyboard is also used as a game controller and can be found on a number of separate devices, most notably early consoles, usually attached to a joystick or a paddle. The keypad is a small grid of keys with at least the digits 0–9. A Gaming keypad is a specialized controller used for FPSs, RTSs and some arcade type games. These controllers can be programmed to allow the emulation of keys, and macros in some cases. These generally resemble a small part of a keyboard but may also feature other inputs such as analog sticks. They were developed because some of these games require a keyboard to play, and some players find this to be awkward for such a task. The mouse and keyboard input is also known by the abbreviation &quot;MnK&quot;.

=== Touchscreen ===
A touchscreen is an input device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the display screen. The first attempt at a handheld game console with touchscreen controls was Sega&#x27;s intended successor to the Game Gear, though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the high cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s. The first released console to use a touchscreen was the Tiger game.com in 1997. Nintendo popularized it for use in video games with the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS; other systems including the Tapwave Zodiac as well as Smartphones and the vast majority of PDAs have also included this feature. The primary controller for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U console, the Wii U GamePad, features an embedded touchscreen. Modern touch screens use a thin, durable, transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto a glass screen. The location of a touch is calculated from the capacitance for the X and Y axes, which varies based upon where the sheet is touched. One console that is touchscreen developed by Sony is the PlayStation Vita which has a 5-inch OLED touchscreen. The Nintendo Switch features a 6.2 inch touchscreen.

=== Motion sensing ===

Motion controllers include the Sega Activator, released in 1993 for the Mega Drive (Genesis). Based on the Light Harp invented by Assaf Gurner, it could read the player&#x27;s physical movements and was the first controller to allow full-body motion sensing. However, it was a commercial failure due to its &quot;unwieldiness and inaccuracy&quot;. Nintendo&#x27;s Wii system released in 2006 utilizes the Wii Remote controller, which uses accelerometers to detect its approximate orientation and acceleration and an image sensor, so it can be used as a pointing device. The Sixaxis, DualShock 3, and PlayStation Move controllers for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 system have similar motion sensing capabilities. In 2010, Microsoft released the Kinect for the Xbox 360. This motion sensing controller uses cameras to track a player’s movement. Microsoft released a revised version of the Kinect with the launch of the Xbox One. This controller was bundled with the console on launch, and was removed from the default bundle in June 2014. Sony&#x27;s EyeToy similarly uses cameras to detect the player&#x27;s motions and translate them into inputs for the game. Controllers with gyroscopes may be used to create a pointer without a camera; for example the Joy-Con and Nintendo Switch Pro Controller are used for this in games such as ports of World of Goo and Super Mario Galaxy from the Wii.

=== Adaptive controllers ===
An adaptive controller is collections of various input methods that can be combined in multiple ways to create a controller that works for the user. The adaptive controller was designed for people with physical disabilities that would prevent them from using a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. An example would be PlayStation&#x27;s access controller which allows for a large joystick, eight buttons on a circular pad, and four ports to plug in additional buttons or accessories. Xbox and Logitech have collaborated to make an adaptive controller with two large touch pads, a D-pad, three buttons, and 16 ports to plug in additional accessories. These accessories can include joysticks, pedals, triggers and buttons.

=== Light gun ===
A light gun is a peripheral used to &quot;shoot&quot; targets on a screen. They usually roughly resemble firearms or ray guns. Their use is normally limited to rail shooters, or shooting gallery games like Duck Hunt and those which came with the &quot;Shooting Gallery&quot; light gun. A rare example of a non-rail first person shooter game is Taito&#x27;s 1992 video game &quot;Gun Buster&quot;, a first-person shooter that used a joystick to move and a light gun to aim. Though light guns have been used in earlier arcade games such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Periscope&quot; in 1966 and &quot;Missile&quot; in 1969, the first home console light gun was released for the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972; later on, Nintendo would include one standard on their Famicom and NES, called the NES Zapper. Nintendo has also released a &quot;shell&quot; in the style of a light gun for the more recent Wii Remote called the Wii Zapper which comes bundled with the game &quot;Link&#x27;s Crossbow Training&quot;.

=== Rhythm game controllers ===

Rhythm game accessories used for rhythm games can resemble musical instruments, such as guitars (from multi-button guitars in &quot;Guitar Freaks&quot;, the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series, and the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series to real guitars in &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; and &quot;Rocksmith&quot;), keyboards (&quot;Rock Band 3&quot;), drums (&quot;Donkey Konga&quot;, &quot;Drum Mania&quot;, the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series and the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series), or maracas (&quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;) have also seen some success in arcades and home consoles. Other rhythm games are based around the art of Djing or turntablism (&quot;DJ Hero&quot;), or playing a synthesizer (&quot;IIDX&quot;) using a turntable shaped peripheral with buttons.

=== Wireless ===
Wireless versions of many popular controller types (joypads, mice, keyboards) exist, and wireless motion controls are an emerging class for virtual reality.

=== Others ===
* Balance board: The Wii Balance Board comes with the game &quot;Wii Fit&quot;. This was preceded by decades by the &quot;Joyboard&quot;, made to plug into an Atari 2600, to play skiing and surfing games.
* Breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games. All controllers have sensors that sense users breath, with which user controls video game on computer, tablet or on smartphone. Alvio is a breathing trainer, symptom tracker and mobile game controller. Zenytime promotes deep, rhythmic breathing to trigger short-term rewards of controlled breathing (relaxation, improved oxygenation...). Breathing games by Breathing Labs are based on Pursed lip breathing and are used on iPhone / iPad, Windows, macOS and Android devices.
* Buzzers: A recent example of specialized, while very simple, game controllers, is the four large &quot;buzzers&quot; (round buttons) supplied with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 quiz show game series &quot;Buzz!&quot; (2005–present); both game and controllers clearly being inspired by the television show genre. Another example is the &quot;Big Button Pad&quot; supplied with the Xbox 360 quiz show games &quot;Scene It? Lights, Camera, Action&quot; and &quot;Scene It? Box Office Smash&quot; (2007–2008).
* Dance pads, essentially a grid of flat pressure-sensitive gamepad buttons set on a mat meant to be stepped on, have seen niche success with the popularity of rhythm games like &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up&quot;. The dance pad was first introduced by Bandai on the Famicom in 1986 as a part of their &quot;Family Fun Fitness&quot; set, then Exus released the &quot;Foot Craz&quot; pad for the Atari 2600 in 1987. Nintendo purchased the technology from Bandai in 1988 and used it on their &quot;Power Pad&quot;, for the Famicom and NES.
* Exoskeleton controllers use exoskeleton technology to provide the player with different responses based on the player&#x27;s body position, speed of movement, and other sensed data. In addition to audio and visual responses, an exoskeleton controller may provide a controlled resistance to movement and other stimuli to provide realism to the action. This not only lets players feel as if they are actually performing the function, but also helps reinforce the correct muscle pattern for the activity being simulated. The Forcetek XIO is an example of an exoskeleton video game controller.
* Fishing rod: the first fishing rod controller appeared as an accessory for the Dreamcast video console for playing &quot;Sega Marine Fishing&quot;. Later other games for PlayStation console use also a similar controllers.
* Floating Interactive Display: at least two commercial systems (Heliodisplay and FogScreen) offer interactive &quot;floating interfaces&quot; which display an image projected in mid-air but can be interacted with by finger similar to a touch screen.
* Instrument panels are simulated aircraft instrument panels, either generic or specific to a real aircraft, that are used in place of the keyboard to send commands to a flight simulation program. Some of these are far more expensive than all the rest of a computer system combined. The panels usually only simulate switches, buttons, and controls, rather than output instrument displays.
* Train controls: Other instrument panel like hardware such as train controls have been produced. The &quot;RailDriver&quot; for example is designed to work with &quot;Trainz&quot;, &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; and &quot;Kuju Rail Simulator&quot;. (as of January 2009) it is limited in ease of use by the lack of a Windows API for some of the software it is designed to work with. A train controller for a Taito bullet train sim has also been made for the Wii console.
* Mechanical motion tracking systems like Gametrak use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in three-dimensional space in . The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a ball joint such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure the rotation of the spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended.
* Microphone: A few games have made successes in using a headset or microphone as a secondary controller, such as &quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot;, the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series, the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series, the &quot;SingStar&quot; series, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Endwar&quot;, &quot;Lips&quot;, the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series, and the &quot;SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs&quot; series. The use of these microphones allowed players to issue commands to the game, controlling teammates (as in &quot;SOCOM&quot;) and other AI characters (e.g., Pikachu). The Nintendo DS features a microphone that is built into the system. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including speech recognition (&quot;Nintendogs&quot;, &quot;Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!&quot;), chatting online between and during gameplay sessions (&quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;), and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into the microphone (&quot;Feel the Magic: XY/XX&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Mario Party DS&quot;).
* Mind-controlled headset: As of March 24, 2007 a United States/Australian company called Emotiv Systems began launching a mind-controlled device for video games based on electroencephalography. It was reported by The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s Don Clark on MSNBC.
* NeGcon: is a unique controller for racing games on the PlayStation. Physically it resembles a gamepad, but its left and right halves twist relative to each other, making it a variation of the paddle controller.
* Optical motion tracking systems such as TrackIR and FreeTrack use a video camera to track an infrared illuminated or emissive headpiece. Small head movements are tracked and then translated into much larger virtual in-game movements, allowing hands-free view control and improved immersiveness.
* PCGamerBike similar to a pair of pedals removed from an exercise bike, then set down in front of a chair &amp; used to precisely control game characters instead.
* Pinball controllers and multi-button consoles for strategy games were released in the past, but their popularity was limited to hardcore fans of the genre.
* R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) is an accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), which allowed players to interact with NES games by controlling the robot. Known in Japan as the &quot;Famicom Robot&quot;, this short-lived accessory jumpstarted Nintendo&#x27;s involvement in the western market, though only used for &quot;Stack-Up&quot; and &quot;Gyromite&quot;. As a character, R.O.B. appeared in later Nintendo games such as &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;.
* The Sega Toylet, an interactive urinal, uses urine as a control method; pressure sensors in the bowl translate the flow of urine into on-screen action.
* &quot;Steel Battalion&quot; for the Xbox was bundled with a full dashboard, with 2 joysticks and over 30 buttons, in an attempt to make it feel like an actual mecha simulator.
* SpaceOrb 360 was a 3D mouse for spatial interaction in 6DOF that e.g. could be used with &quot;Descent&quot;.

== Use on PCs and other devices ==
Although gamepads are generally developed for use with consoles, they are also often used for PC gaming and mobile gaming. Modern controllers, such as Sony&#x27;s DualShock 4 and Nintendo&#x27;s Switch Pro Controller, support USB and Bluetooth, allowing them to be directly connected to most PCs. Older gamepads can be connected through the use of official or third-party adapters. Controllers typically require the installation of device drivers to be used on contemporary personal computers. The device may be directly supported, or it may require the use of a specialized program which maps controller inputs to mouse and keyboard inputs. Examples of this kind of software include JoyToKey, Xpadder, and antimicro, which is free, open-source, and cross-platform.

Some controllers are specially designed for usage outside of consoles. In this case, support for mapping to different devices is built into the controller itself, such as with the Nostromo SpeedPad n52, which can act as either a keyboard, mouse, or joystick; or with the Samsung Android GamePad, designed for use with Android mobile phones.

The usage of gamepads over the mouse and keyboard has been referred to as a debate, with players of MMORPGs, RTS games, and first-person shooters tending to prefer the mouse and keyboard due to the wider variety of inputs and the high precision of the mouse when compared to an analog stick. Likewise, players of racing games, fighting games, and action RPGs tend to prefer controllers for their analog inputs and ergonomic button layouts.

<doc id="104440" wikidata="Q962442" url="?curid=104440" title="Martin Parr">
<text>Martin Parr (born 23 May 1952) is a British documentary photographer, photojournalist and photobook collector. He is known for his photographic projects that take an intimate, satirical and anthropological look at aspects of modern life, in particular documenting the social classes of England, and more broadly the wealth of the Western world.

His major projects have been rural communities (1975–1982), &quot;The Last Resort&quot; (1983–1985), &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; (1987–1989), &quot;Small World&quot; (1987–1994) and &quot;Common Sense&quot; (1995–1999).

Since 1994, Parr has been a member of Magnum Photos. He has had around 40 solo photobooks published, and has featured in around 80 exhibitions worldwide – including the international touring exhibition &quot;ParrWorld&quot;, and a retrospective at the Barbican Arts Centre, London, in 2002.

The Martin Parr Foundation, founded in 2014, and registered as a charity in 2015 opened premises in his hometown of Bristol in 2017. It houses his own archive, his collection of British and Irish photography by other photographers, and a gallery.

==Life and career==
===Personal life===
Born in Epsom, Surrey, Parr wanted to become a documentary photographer from the age of fourteen. He cites his grandfather, George Parr, an amateur photographer and fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, as an early influence. He married Susan Mitchell and they have one child, Ellen Parr (born 1986). Parr was diagnosed with cancer in May 2021.

===Photographer===
Parr has said of his photography:
The fundamental thing I&#x27;m exploring constantly is the difference between the mythology of the place and the reality of it. ... Remember I make serious photographs disguised as entertainment. That&#x27;s part of my mantra. I make the pictures acceptable to find the audience but deep down there is actually a lot going on that&#x27;s not sharply written in your face. If you want to read it you can read it.

Parr&#x27;s aesthetic is close-up, through use of a macro lens, and employing saturated colour, a result of either the type of film and/or use of a ring flash. This allows him to put his subjects &quot;under the microscope&quot; in their own environment, giving them space to expose their lives and values in ways that often involve inadvertent humour. His technique, as seen in his book &quot;Signs of the Times: A Portrait of the Nation&#x27;s Tastes&quot; (1992), has been said to leave viewers with ambiguous emotional reactions, unsure whether to laugh or cry.

====Manchester Polytechnic, 1970–1973====
Parr studied photography at Manchester Polytechnic from 1970 to 1972 with contemporaries Daniel Meadows and Brian Griffin. Parr and Meadows collaborated on various projects, including working at Butlin&#x27;s as roving photographers. They were part of a new wave of documentary photographers, &quot;a loose British grouping, which, though it never gave itself a title have become variously known as &#x27;the Young British Photographers&#x27;, &#x27;Independent Photographers&#x27; and the &#x27;New British Photography&#x27;.&quot;

====Rural communities, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Ireland, 1975–1982====
In 1975 Parr moved to Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire where he would complete his first mature work. He was involved with the Albert Street Workshop, a hub for artistic activity which included a darkroom and exhibition space. Parr spent five years photographing rural life in the area, focusing on the Methodist (and some Baptist) non-conformist chapels, a focal point for isolated farming communities that in the early 1970s were closing down. He photographed in black-and-white, for its nostalgic nature and for it being appropriate to his celebratory look at this past activity. Also, photographers at that time were obliged to work in black-and-white to be taken seriously, colour being associated with commercial and snapshot photography. His series &quot;The Non-Conformists&quot; was widely exhibited at the time and published as a book in 2013. Critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said &quot;It&#x27;s easy to forget how quietly observational Parr was as a black-and-white photographer.&quot;

In 1980 Parr married Susan Mitchell and, for her work, they moved to the west coast of Ireland. He set up a darkroom in Boyle, County Roscommon.

Parr&#x27;s first publications, &quot;Bad Weather&quot;, published in 1982 by Zwemmer with an Arts Council subsidy, &quot;Calderdale Photographs&quot; (1984) and &quot;A Fair Day: Photographs from the West Coast of Ireland&quot; (1984), all featured photographs from mostly northern England, and Ireland, in black-and-white. He used a Leica M3 with a 35 mm lens; although for &quot;Bad Weather&quot; he quickly switched to an underwater camera with a flashgun.

====The working class, &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, 1982–1985====
In 1982 Parr and his wife moved to Wallasey, England, and he switched permanently to colour photography, inspired by the work of US colour photographers, mostly Joel Meyerowitz, but also William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, and also the British Peter Fraser and Peter Mitchell. Parr has written that &quot;I had also encountered the post cards of John Hinde when I worked at Butlin&#x27;s in the early 70s and the bright saturated colour of these had a big impact on me.&quot; During the summers of 1983, 1984 and 1985 he photographed working-class people at the seaside in nearby New Brighton. This work was published in the book &quot;The Last Resort: Photographs of New Brighton&quot; (1986) and exhibited in Liverpool and London.

Although John Bulmer had pioneered colour documentary photography of Britain, from 1965, Gerry Badger has said of &quot;The Last Resort&quot;:
It is difficult from a perspective of almost a quarter of a century to underestimate [sic] the significance of &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, either in British photography or Martin Parr&#x27;s career. For both, it represented a seismic change in the basic mode of photographic expression, from monochrome to colour, a fundamental technical change that heralded the development of a new tone in documentary photography.

Karen Wright, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, has said &quot;He was attacked by some critics for his scrutiny of the working classes, but looking at these works, one merely sees Parr&#x27;s unflinching eye capturing the truth of a social class embracing leisure in whatever form available.&quot;

====The middle class, &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; (1987–1989)====
In 1985 Parr completed a commission for the Documentary Photography Archive in Manchester to photograph people at supermarkets in Salford, &quot;Retailing in the Borough of Salford&quot;, which is now held at the archive.

He and his wife moved to Bristol in 1987, where they still live. During 1987 and 1988 he completed his next major project, on the middle class, who were at that time becoming increasingly affluent under Thatcherism. He photographed middle-class activities such as shopping, dinner parties and school open days, predominantly around Bristol and Bath in the southwest of England. It was published as his next book &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; (1989) and exhibited in Bath, London, Oxford and Paris.

His book &quot;One Day Trip&quot; (1989) featured photographs taken when he accompanied people on a booze cruise to France, a commission from Mission Photographique Transmanche.

====Mass tourism, &quot;Small World&quot; (1987–1994)====

Between 1987 and 1994 Parr travelled internationally to make his next major series, a critique of mass tourism, published as &quot;Small World&quot; in 1995. A revised edition with additional photographs was published in 2007. It was exhibited in 1995–1996 in London, Paris, Edinburgh, and Palma in Spain and has continued to be shown in various locations since.

He was visiting professor of photography at the University of Art and Design in Helsinki between 1990 and 1992.

====Global consumerism, &quot;Common Sense&quot; (1995–1999)====

Between 1995 and 1999 Parr made the series &quot;Common Sense&quot; about global consumerism. &quot;Common Sense&quot; was an exhibition of 350 prints, and a book published in 1999 with 158 images. The exhibition was first shown in 1999 and was staged simultaneously in forty-one venues in seventeen countries. The pictures depict the minutiae of consumer culture, and are intended to show the ways in which people entertain themselves. The photographs were taken with 35 mm ultra-saturated film for its vivid, heightened colours.
===Magnum Photos===
Parr joined Magnum Photos as an associate member in 1988. The vote on his inclusion as a full member in 1994 was divisive, with Philip Jones Griffiths circulating a plea to other members not to admit him. Parr achieved the necessary two-thirds majority by one vote. Magnum membership helped him work on editorial photography, and on editorial fashion photography for Paul Smith, Louis Vuitton, Galerie du jour Agnès B. and Madame Figaro.

In 2014 Parr was voted in as president of Magnum Photos International, a post he held for 3.5 years until 2017.

===Collector===

====Photobooks====
Parr is a collector and critic of photobooks. His collaboration with the critic Gerry Badger, &quot;The Photobook: A History&quot; (in three volumes) covers more than 1,000 examples of photobooks from the 19th century through to the present day. The first two volumes took eight years to complete. Tate Modern&#x27;s retrospective exhibition of Daidō Moriyama in London included many Moriyama books loaned from Parr displayed in vitrines.

====Other items====
Parr also collects postcards, photographs and various other items of vernacular and popular culture such as wallpaper, Saddam Hussein watches and prostitute advertising cards from phoneboxes (items with a photograph on them). Here too, items from his collections have been used as the basis for publications and exhibitions. Since the 1970s, Parr has collected and publicised the garish postcards made between the 1950s and 1970s by John Hinde and his team of photographers.

===Curator===
Parr was guest artistic director for the 2004 Rencontres d&#x27;Arles festival of photography, guest curator of the &quot;New Typologies&quot; exhibition at the 2008 New York Photo Festival, and guest curator of Brighton Photo Biennial in 2010, which he called &quot;New Documents&quot;. Critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said &quot;Back in 2004, he was invited by the organisers of the annual Rencontres D&#x27;Arles to be guest curator. That year&#x27;s Arles festival, in its range and ambition, remains the standard by which all subsequent Rencontres have been judged.&quot;

Parr was artistic director of the newly established Bristol Photo Festival, scheduled to open in 2021. However in July 2020 he quit, due to his involvement with a 2018 reissue of the photobook &quot;London&quot; by Gian Butturini, after a campaign by an anthropology student at University College London, who called a pairing of photographs in it racist.

===Film and television===
Parr has been involved in making television, and documentary and other films.

From 1990 to 1992 Parr collaborated with Nick Barker, taking photographs to accompany Barker&#x27;s film &quot;Signs of the Times&quot;.

In 1997, Parr began producing his own television documentaries with Mosaic Film.

In 2003 Parr was the subject of and appeared extensively in the &quot;Imagine&quot; BBC One TV series episode &quot;The World According to Parr&quot;, directed and produced by Rebecca Frayn, and hosted and executive produced by Alan Yentob.

He was cameraman on the film &quot;It&#x27;s Nice Up North&quot; (2006) with comedian Graham Fellows (as his character John Shuttleworth). The film is a comic documentary filmed over several years in Shetland.

In 2007 Parr took part in BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;The Genius of Photography&quot;, a six-part documentary series exploring the history of photography. In 2008 he was one of three judges on the Channel 4 series &quot;Picture This&quot;.

In 2014 Parr created &quot;Turkey and Tinsel&quot;, a 60-minute deadpan and often hilarious observational video documentary about faux Christmas in small town England.

===Teaching===
Parr was a visiting lecturer at West Surrey College of Art &amp; Design (now University for the Creative Arts) in Farnham, Surrey. In 2004 he was appointed professor of photography at the University of Wales, Newport. In 2013 he was appointed professor of photography at Ulster University in Belfast.

==Martin Parr Foundation==
The Martin Parr Foundation was founded in 2014. It opened premises in Bristol in October 2017. The Foundation houses Parr&#x27;s own archive, and his collection of prints and book dummies made by other photographers—mainly British and Irish photography, and work by several photographers from abroad who have photographed in the UK. There is a gallery open to the public—its first exhibition was Parr&#x27;s &quot;Black Country Stories&quot;—and it is a hub for talks, screenings and events. The Foundation is located in Paintworks in south East Bristol. Parr is the Foundation&#x27;s main source of income.

==Reception==
The German photographic curator Thomas Weski has said:
Martin Parr is a chronicler of our age... Leisure, consumption and communication are the concepts that this British photographer has been researching for several decades now on his worldwide travels... Parr enables us to see things that have seemed familiar to us in a completely new way.

Dan Rule, writing in &quot;The Age&quot;, has said:
Parr&#x27;s signature is his ability not only to isolate the most evocative of human details, but to elevate such visual fragments to that of the wider societal signpost or glyph.
