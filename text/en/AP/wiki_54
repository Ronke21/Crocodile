<text>Prince Claus of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg (born Klaus-Georg Wilhelm Otto Friedrich Gerd von Amsberg; 6 September 1926 – 6 October 2002) was Prince of the Netherlands from 30 April 1980 until 6 October 2002, as the husband of Queen Beatrix.

Initially a diplomat in the service of West Germany and West German deputy ambassador to Ivory Coast, Claus met Beatrix on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1963 and married her in 1966. When his wife ascended to the throne in 1980, Claus took his place as Prince of the Netherlands, which he held until his death in 2002.

==Biography==
Klaus-Georg Wilhelm Otto Friedrich Gerd von Amsberg was born on his mother&#x27;s family&#x27;s estate, Schloss Dötzingen, Hitzacker, Germany, on 6 September 1926. He was the second child and only son of Claus Felix von Amsberg and his wife, Baroness Gösta von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen. His father, by birth a member of House of Amsberg which belonged to the untitled German nobility from Mecklenburg, operated a large farm in Tanganyika (formerly German East Africa) from 1928 until World War II. His mother belonged to the ancient von dem Bussche noble family which originated from the County of Ravensberg. From 1938, Claus and his six sisters grew up on their maternal grandmother&#x27;s estate in Lower Saxony; he attended the Friderico-Francisceum-Gymnasium in Bad Doberan from 1933 to 1936 and a boarding school in Tanganyika from 1936 to 1938.

Claus was a member of such Nazi youth organisations as Deutsches Jungvolk and the Hitler Youth. From 1938 until 1942, he attended the German Baltenschule Misdroy in what is now Międzyzdroje, Poland.

In 1944, Claus was conscripted into the German Wehrmacht, becoming a soldier in the German 90th Panzergrenadier Division in Italy in March 1945. He was taken prisoner of war by the American forces at Meran before taking part in any fighting. After his repatriation, he finished school in Lüneburg and studied law in Hamburg. He then joined the German diplomatic corps and worked in Santo Domingo and Ivory Coast. In the 1960s, he was transferred to Bonn.

Claus met Princess Beatrix for the first time on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1963 in Bad Driburg at a dinner hosted by the Count von Oeynhausen-Sierstorpff, who was a distant relative of both of them. Claus and Beatrix were also distantly related (5th cousins twice removed), as both being descendants from von dem Bussche family. They met again at the wedding-eve party of Princess Tatjana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse, in the summer of 1964. With memories of German oppression still very strong 20 years after the war, sections of the Dutch population were unhappy that Beatrix&#x27;s fiancé was a German and former member of the Hitler Youth. Nonetheless, Queen Juliana gave the engagement her blessing after giving serious thought to canceling it. The engagement was approved by the States-General—a necessary step for Beatrix to remain in the line of succession to the throne—in 1965. He was granted Dutch citizenship later that year and changed the spellings of his names to Dutch.

The couple were married on 10 March 1966. Their wedding day saw violent protests, most notably by the anarchist-artist group Provo. They included such memorable slogans as &quot;Claus, &#x27;raus!&quot; (Claus, get out!) and &quot;Mijn fiets terug&quot; (Give me back my bike), a reference to the memory of occupying German soldiers confiscating Dutch bicycles. A smoke bomb was thrown at the wedding carriage by a group of Provos. For a time, it was thought that Beatrix would be the last monarch of the Netherlands.

However, over time, Claus became accepted by the public, so much so that during the last part of his life he was considered by some to be the most popular member of the royal family. This change in Dutch opinion was brought about by Claus&#x27;s strong motivation to contribute to public causes (especially Third World development, on which he was considered an expert), his sincere modesty and his candor (within but sometimes on the edge of royal protocol).

The public also sympathised with Claus for his efforts to give meaning to his life beyond the restrictions that Dutch law imposed on the royal family&#x27;s freedom of speech and action. However, these restrictions were gradually loosened; Claus was even appointed as senior staff member at the Department of Developing Aid, albeit in an advisory role.

One example of his attitude toward protocol was the &quot;Declaration of the Tie&quot;. In 1998, after presenting the annual Prince Claus Awards to three African fashion designers, Claus told &quot;workers of all nations to unite and cast away the new shackles they have voluntarily cast upon themselves&quot;, meaning the necktie, that &quot;snake around my neck,&quot; and encouraged the audience to &quot;venture into open-collar paradise&quot;. He then removed his tie and threw it on the floor.

Claus battled depression for a number of years, and underwent surgery in 1998 to remove his prostate. In 2001, he underwent another surgery to remove one of his kidneys. He eventually died on 6 October 2002 from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and heart failure.

===Activities===
As a husband of the heir, Claus was a member of the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation and its Bureau, and was a chair of the National Committee for Development Strategy 1970‑1980 and the Netherlands Development Organization. He also worked as special advisor to the Minister for Development Cooperation. He held these positions until 1980.

On 30 April 1980, Claus&#x27; mother-in-law, Queen Juliana, abdicated in favour of Princess Beatrix, who became Queen of the Netherlands. After the investiture, the couple visited the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. As a prince consort, Prince Claus frequently visited public organisations, commercial and industrial enterprises, and companies in the agriculture and fisheries sector.

In 1984, Claus became the Inspector General for Development Cooperation, member of the Board of Directors of De Nederlandsche Bank N.V. (until 1998), member of the Board of Directors of Royal PTT Nederland, and Chair of the Transport and Public Works Platform.

Claus was an honorary chair of the National Coordinating Committee for the Protection of Monuments and Historic Buildings and the King William I Foundation. He was also a patron of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and Scouting Netherlands.

On Claus&#x27; seventieth birthday, the Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development was established on the initiative of the Dutch government. The fund focused on enhancing understanding of cultures and promoting interaction between culture and development.

===Declining health and death===
Claus suffered various health problems, such as depression, cancer and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died of complications of pneumonia and Parkinson&#x27;s at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam on 6 October 2002 after a long illness, aged 76. He died less than four months after the birth of his first grandchild.

Claus was interred in the royal family&#x27;s tomb in Delft on 15 October. It was the first full state funeral since Queen Wilhelmina&#x27;s in 1962.

<text>The daityas () are a race of asuras in Hindu mythology, descended from Kashyapa and his wife, Diti. Prominent members of this race include Hiranyaksha, Hiranyakashipu, and Mahabali, all of whom overran the earth, and required three of Vishnu&#x27;s avataras to be vanquished.

== Literature ==
The Manusmṛiti classifies the daityas as good, while placing them at a lower level than the devas:

The origin and noteworthy members of this race are specified in the Harivamsha Purana:

<text>Vamana (, ) also known as Trivikrama (), Urukrama (), Upendra (), Dadhivamana (, ), and Balibandhana (), is an avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu. He is the fifth avatar of Vishnu and the first Dashavatara in the Treta Yuga, after Narasimha.

First mentioned in the Vedas, Vamana is most commonly associated in the Hindu epics and Puranas with the story of taking back the three worlds (collectively referred to as the Trailokya) from the daitya-king Mahabali by taking three steps to restore the cosmic order and push Mahabali into netherworld. He is the youngest among the adityas, the sons of Aditi and the sage Kashyapa.

== Nomenclature and etymology ==
&#x27;Vāmana&#x27; (Sanskrit वामन) means &#x27;dwarf&#x27;, &#x27;small&#x27; or &#x27;small or short in stature&#x27;. It also means &#x27;dwarfish bull&#x27;, which is notable as Vishnu is directly associated with dwarfish animals (including bulls) in the Vedas (see below). Stated in Puranic literature to be born of the great sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, other names or epithets referring to Vamana include:
== Legend ==
After Indra (The king of the devas, the son of Kashyapa and Aditi) is defeated by the daitya called Bali, the king of the asuras, the great-great grandson of Kashyapa and Diti, the devas ultimately seek refuge in Vishnu, who agrees to restore Indra to power. To do so, Vishnu incarnates as Vamana (the son of Kashyapa and Aditi). The devoted Bali conducts ritual sacrifices (partaken by the asuras, but not the devas under Bali&#x27;s rule), one of which is attended by Vamana, who requests only three feet (steps) of land (usually to build a fire-altar). Bali agrees, despite being warned about Vamana&#x27;s true nature as Vishnu (usually by his preceptor, the sage Shukra, a descendant of Bhrigu). Vamana grows in size, and in three strides, encompasses all of existence and beyond. The three worlds are restored to Indra, and Bali and the asuras are banished to Patala, the netherworld.

== Symbolism ==
A. A. Macdonell states that the &#x27;reason why Visnu took his three steps is a secondary trait. He thrice traversed the earthly spaces for man in distress (6, 49); he traversed the earth to bestow it on man for a dwelling (7, 100); he traversed the earthly spaces for wide-stepping existence (1, 155); with Indra he took vast strides and stretched out the worlds for our existence (6, 69). This feature in the [Rigveda] may ultimately be traced to the myth of Vishnu&#x27;s dwarf incarnation which appears in the epics and Puranas. The intermediate stage is found in the Brahmanas ([Shatapatha Brahmana] 1, 2, 5; [Taittiriya Samhita] 2, 1, 3; [Taittiriya Brahmana] 1, 6, 1), where Vishnu takes the form of a dwarf, to reclaim the earth for the devas by means of sacrifice.The three points in sun&#x27;s course: Roy states that &#x27;Vishnu&#x27;s three strides alluded to in the Rigveda have been variously interpreted as symbolizing the three different positions of the sun at its rising, peak and setting.

The three worlds and the three planes: J. Muir mentions Sayanas take on the three steps of Vishnu found the White Yajurveda (5.15). &#x27;Vishnu, becoming incarnate as Trivikrama (the god who stepped thrice), strode over the whole universe. The same idea is expressed by the Rishis, &quot;In three places he planted his step, (one step on the earth, a second in the atmosphere, and a third in the sky) as Agni, Vayu, and Surya each after the other&quot;. Agni (Fire) is found on the ground, Vayu (Air) prevades the atmosphere and Surya(Sun) high in the dome of sky, thus the three steps symbolise the three planes, the ground below, air in between, and the sky above.
Three states of sleep and wakefulness: S. Chanda states the three strides symbolize the three states of existence – Jagrat (Awake), Swapna (Dream Sleep) and &quot;sushupti&quot; (Deep Sleep). The final step of Vamana is on the head of Bali which symbolizes Liberation and the transcendence of these states.

=== Nirukta ===
Written by the grammarian Yaska, Nirukta is one of the six Vedangas or &#x27;limbs of the Vedas&#x27;, concerned with correct etymology and interpretation of the Vedas. The entry for Vishnu (relating to the Rigveda) states (square brackets &#x27;[ ]&#x27; are as per the original author):

This account essentially states that the three footsteps may symbolise the positions of the sun or physical existence conceptualised as &#x27;three worlds&#x27;. In regard to the references to Sakapuni and Aurnavabha, K. S. Murty states that &#x27;Yaska was not the first to interpret Vedic words as he did. He referred to a Nighantu with Samamnaya which he cited and explained. He had predecessors like Sakapuru, Audumbarayana, Aupamanyava and others&#x27;.

== Vedas ==
=== Rigveda ===
==== Samhita ====

Roy states that the Rigvedic passages referring to Vishnu&#x27;s three strides are obviously the nucleus, out of which the legend of the Dwarf was created. But the Rigveda, however, does not describe Vishnu as dwarf or &quot;Vamana&quot;&#x27;. W. J. Wilkins agrees, stating that in regard to the Vishnu strides of the Rigveda, &#x27;in these verses there is probably the germ of the Dwarf Incarnation&#x27;.

In regard to the above-quoted verses, it is commonly accepted that there are Seven Continents or &#x27;regions of the earth&#x27;. A. Glucklich adds that &#x27;In the Matsya Purana, for instance, there is a seven-part map of the world ... [it has] one centre, where an immense mountain – Mount Meru (or Maha Meru, Great Meru) – stands ... The continents encircle the mountain in seven concentric circles ... It seems clear that the Himalayas were the approximate location of Mt. Meru&#x27;.

In regard to the three steps of Vishnu, Glucklich points out that in some legends of Vamana and the Asura-King Bali, that &#x27;the first [Step] covered the entire earth, the second covered the atmosphere, and the third measured heaven in its entirety&#x27;. M. Haug, in his translation of the Aitareya Brahmana (1.1.5) of the Rigveda, clarifies that the &#x27;three worlds&#x27; often means the Ground (Earth), the Air (Atmosphere), and the Sky (Heavens). Three steps thus encompasses all of physical existence (although in some Puranic accounts Vamana does so in only two steps). D. Goodall also relates more a mystical interpretation of what &#x27;three worlds&#x27; symbolises, as provided by the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, including Mind, Speech, and Breath (see Upanishad section, below).

Notably, Muir also states that although &#x27;&quot;Adabhya&quot;&#x27; can be translated as &#x27;who cannot be deceived&#x27; (as provided by Griffiths, above), it can also be translated as &#x27;the unconquerable preserver&#x27;, and notes that the &#x27;idea of Vishnu being preeminently the preserver of the universe, which became current in later times [i.e. in the Trimurti], may possibly have been derived from this verse&#x27;.

==== Aitareya Brahmana ====
The concept of Vishnu obtaining the three worlds for the Devas from the Asuras in three steps is clearly explained in the Aitareya Brahmana. The Rigveda Samhita verse referred to (6.69.8) regarding Indra and Vishnu battling the Asuras states &#x27;Ye Twain have conquered, ne’er have ye been conquered: never hath either of the Twain been vanquished. Ye, Indra-Vishnu, when ye fought the battle, produced this infinite with three divisions&#x27;.

The Maruts, referred to as &#x27;the sons of Rudra&#x27; are frequently mentioned throughout the Rigveda, including in relation to the above quotation, producing rain (1.38.7). Indra is the god of rain and as stated in the Aitareya Brahmana, &#x27;rain gives food&#x27; (2.5.41; pp. 106). This is elaborated upon in the Aitareya Aranyaka (Aranyaka 2, Adhyaya 3) which states &quot;the seed of the devas is rain. The seed of rain is herbs. The seed of herbs is food&quot;. Additionally, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna states &#x27;All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yajna&#x27; (3.14).

=== Sama Veda ===
==== Samhita ====
The translator, R.T.H. Griffith, states in his introduction to the Sama Veda that it &#x27;is made up of hymns, portions of hymns, and detached verses, taken mainly from the &quot;Rigveda&quot;&#x27;. The above-quoted Sama Veda hymn, for example, is taken directly from Rigveda hymn 1.22.

==== Pancavimsa Brahmana ====
The terms &#x27;stoma&#x27; and &#x27;saman&#x27; from the above-quoted Pancavimsa Brahmana refer to mantras and hymns, such from the Sama Veda.

The Jaiminīya Brahmana has a similar verse (1.3.3.2; also of the Sama Veda) which omits Vishnu&#x27;s strides but explains the Varavantiya saman as &#x27;He who desired cattle should apply the Varavantiya Saman. Prajapati created the animals. Having been created they ran away from him. By means of the Varavantiya Saman he held them back. Because he held them back (&quot;avarayat&quot;) therefore the Varavantiya is called the Varavantiya. The application of the Varavantiya as the agnistoma Saman is made in order that the animals remain present and do not run away&#x27;.

In the Taittiriya Samhita 5.5.8 (Black Yajurveda) Varavantiya is also explained as &#x27;Prajapati created Agni; he [Agni], [being] created, went away from him; him [Agni] he [Prajapati] checked (&quot;avarayata&quot;) by the Varavantiya, and that is why the Varavantiya has its name. By the Cyaita he congealed him, and that is why the Cyaita has its name. In that he reverences, with the Varavantiya, he restrains him, and by the Cyaita he congeals him&#x27;.

The strides of Vishnu are thus referred to in regard to restraining animals from running away from sacrifices (often in rituals rice-cakes and other plant or milk-based foods would be symbolically sacrificed while the actual animals they represented would be left unharmed). This idea of being restrained by Vishnu strides may be linked to Bali often being restrained or bound in the legend of Vamana.

=== Yajur Veda ===
==== White Yajurveda: Vajasaneyi Samhita ====

In regard to the above quotation, Aiyangar states that long (i.e. including braided) hair indicates Munis, and shaven hair indicates &#x27;an ascetic of the order of sannyasin&#x27;. Roy argues that in &#x27;the Satarudriya hymn of the Yajurveda [i.e. Vajasaneyi Samhita, Book 16, as quoted above], Rudra is referred to as &quot;vamana&quot;. Rudra is said to preside over the asterism of Ardra and may, therefore, be understood to denote the star&#x27;.

However, the terms &#x27;thousand-eyed&#x27; (i.e. Purusha, see second account of Vamana in the Harivamsa, below), &#x27;mountain-haunter&#x27; (e.g. Rigveda 1.154, above), and &#x27;Sipivishta&#x27; given in the above-quote all also apply to Vishnu. In addition, the Shatapatha Brahmana (attached to the Vajasaneyi Samhita), relates the legend of Vishnu as a Dwarf, not Rudra /Shiva. Regardless, in the Puranas there are legends of both Vishnu and Shiva incarnating as Brahmin-dwarfs, and the above-quoted hymn provides the essential ingredients: the Brahmin, the Dwarf, and the concept of growth.

==== White Yajurveda: Shatapatha Brahmana ====


Muir states about this legend in the Shatapatha Brahmana that &#x27;Vishnu is represented as a dwarf, and as having, under the form of sacrifice, conquered the whole earth... [this] contains the germ of the story of the Dwarf [i.e. Vamana] incarnation&#x27;. This legend is given in relation to the &quot;Darsapûrnamâseshtî&quot;, or &#x27;New and Full-moon Sacrifices&#x27;. The translator, Eggeling, states (footnote 59:1 of the given link) that the above-quoted legend &#x27;represents the &quot;Purva-Parigraha&quot;, or first enclosing of the altar by a single line being drawn with the wooden sword [a sacrificial instrument called a &quot;satasphyam&quot;] on each of the three sides&#x27;. He also supposes (while admitting he cannot prove it) that the size of Vishnu may represent &#x27;the sun-light, which, on shrinking to a dwarf&#x27;s size in the evening, is the only means of preservation left to the devas&#x27;.

This instruction, relating directly to the Vishnu strides mentioned in the Rigveda, is also given in relation to the &quot;Darsapūrnamāseshtī&quot;, or &#x27;New and Full-moon Sacrifices&#x27;. The three strides of Vishnu are not mentioned in direct relation to the legend of Vishnu as a dwarf. Instead, they are mentioned in regard to the performance of sacrifices to consecrate the sacrificial ground (e.g. to drive away the Rakshasas or &#x27;demons&#x27; and solidify their own power).

This quote shows that &#x27;Bali&#x27; is used refer to oblative portions or sacrificial offerings in ritual ceremonies such as the Agnihotra. In combination with &#x27;Bali&#x27; being used to refer to taxes (see Taittiriya Brahmana, below), it therefore seems possible these meanings are linked with Bali being a king that loved to perform sacrifices and give sacrificial offerings (e.g. such as three steps of land).

==== Black Yajurveda: Taittiriya Samhita ====
As per the above quote from the Taittirya Samhita, the sacrificial fee for Vishnu is a dwarf-animal (also stated in 1.8.1 (ox), 1.8.8, and 1.8.17). As D.A. Soifer states, the &#x27;series of connections inherent in all this seems to be as follows: Visnu&#x27;s three steps regain the worlds - Vishnu as a dwarf takes the three steps - a dwarf animal is sacrificed to Visnu to gain the power of this three steps&#x27;.

==== Black Yajurveda: Taittiriya Brahmana ====
This quote shows that &#x27;Bali&#x27; is used refer to taxes paid to the King. It seems possible that this is linked to the character of Bali being a king (of the Asuras) who - also consistent with the other meaning of &#x27;sacrificial offerings or oblations&#x27; - loved to perform sacrifices and give sacrificial offerings (such as land requested by dwarf-Brahmins).

=== Atharva Veda ===
== Upanishads ==

=== Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ===


The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is one of the Mukhya or Principal 108 Upanishads. From the last book of the Satapatha Brahmana (Kanva recension; this article cites the Madhyandina recension in the section above, which does not contain the Upanishad), it is a treatise on Atman (Soul or Self), and has been commented upon by figures such as Adi Shankar and Madhvacharya.

According to this Sruti scripture, the concept of the &#x27;three worlds&#x27; does not just refer to physical reality (i.e. ground, atmosphere, and sky). It also has other - more mystical - meanings, including Speech, Mind, and Vital Force. As such, the legend of Vamana striding over the three worlds in two or three steps also may have more mystical meanings, and those provided by the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad seem to be consistent with established Vedic concepts such as Pancha Bhoota (the Hindu classical elements). For example, it is stated by the above-quoted Upanishad that the first step on the earth also represents the organ of speech (&#x27;vac&#x27; or &#x27;vak&#x27;). According to other authoritative - including Sruti sources - the first step, ground, and speech are all represented by Agni (God of Fire; fire-altars are key components of sacrifices):

*Sayana states that the first step on the earth is represented by Agni (see above).
*The Taittiriya Samhita (Black Yajurveda) 1.7.11 states &#x27;Agni with one syllable won speech&#x27; (2.1.4 also explains the symbolic significance of the number three).
* The Shatapatha Brahmana (White Yajurveda) 3.2.2.13 states &#x27;Agni is speech&#x27;.

== Itihasa (Epics) ==

=== Mahabharata ===


The Mahabharata, ascribed to the sage Vyasa, is one of two epic poems (Itihasa) in the Hindu cannon. Most notably, of the 18 the books (&quot;parvas&quot;) of the Mahabharata, the sixth (called the Bhishma Parva) is the Bhagavad Gita, containing the teachings of Krishna (synonymous with Vishnu / Hari, as evidenced by the Mahabharata itself). The main account of Vamana is quoted above from chapter 270 of the third book, the Vana Parva, in its entirety. All other references cited are either brief mentions of this legend or supplementary information such as blessings that can be obtained in relation to Vamana.

Notably, academics such as J. Melton and C. A. Jones state that &#x27;Onam, an ancient rice harvest festival, is now tied to the story of King Mahabali as recounted in the epic Indian tale, the Mahabharata... Vishnu, impressed with Mahabali&#x27;s devotion, granted him [Bali] the boon of being able to revisit his former subjects once a year&#x27;. However, no references were provided and no such account has been found in the Mahabharata (at least in the translation by K.M. Ganguli). Other notable details include:

* Referring to the Rigveda (i.e. the three steps of Vishnu), it is stated &#x27;He is the great Boar. He is the great Man-Lion, and He is the Three-stepped Lord&#x27; (Book 6, Bhishma Parva, LXVII)
*Aditi gave birth to the devas (including Vamana), Diti the Asuras, and Danu the Danavas; all are wives of Kashyapa (Book 12, Santi Parva, CCVII)
*Krishna, while informing the sage Narada of His incarnations including Vamana, states &#x27;The Vedas... were re-created by me in the Satya Yuga (Golden Age). They have once more disappeared or may only be partially heard here and there in the Puranas&#x27; (Book 12, Santi Parva, CCCXL)
*It is stated that &#x27;By observing a fast on the twelfth day of the moon in the month of Ashadha and worshipping Krishna as the dwarf (who beguiled the Asura king Vali), one attains to the merits of the Naramedha sacrifice and sports in happiness with the Apsaras&#x27; (Book 13, Anusasana Parva, CIX)
*Vishnu states &#x27;who behold a Brahmana that is a dwarf in stature, or a boar that has just risen from water and that bears on his head a quantity of mud taken up from the bank, have never to meet with any evil. They become freed from every sin&#x27; (Book 13, Anusasana Parva, CXXVI)

==== Harivamsa ====
===== First account =====
The first account consists of only one chapter (Bhavishya Parva: XXVII / 27). It begins with the Daitya Bali, having conquered Indra and the devas, conducting a Rajasuya sacrifice, officiated by Shukra and joined by &#x27;many Brahmanas observant of ascetic vows and well read in the Vedas&#x27;. At this sacrifice Sarasvati (Lakshmi) appears and grants Bali a boon. Vamana is then born, takes the three worlds away from Bali in three footsteps, and restores Indra to power while the &#x27;Daityas entered into the nether region&#x27;. Bali gratifies the devas with an &#x27;offering of ambrosia&#x27;, and so &#x27;was shorn of his sins and became immortal&#x27;.

===== Second account =====
The second account of the legend of Vamana is very similar to the accounts in the Matsya Purana and Vamana Purana. As shown above in comparison to the Vamana Purana, there are even strong similarities in wording, despite being a different translation of different text by a different translator. It therefore seems likely that either all three texts share a common source, or that one is the origin of the others.

The second - and main - account of Vamana consists of 7 chapters (Bhavishya Parva: XL-XLVI / 40–46). &#x27;Kashyapa, the well-dressed son of Marichi, espoused two sisters of Prajapati, Diti and Aditi&#x27;. Aditi gives birth to the twelve classes of celestials / Adityas / Suras (e.g. &#x27;Indra&#x27; is the name of a post or class of a god, not an individual), and Diti gives birth to the demons / Daityas / Asuras, including Hiranyakashipu, the great-grandfather of Bali. After Hiranyakashipu is destroyed by the Narasimha incarnation, the noble Bali is crowned King of the Asuras (XL). Having defeated Indra and the Suras, Bali is congratulated by Lakshmi (XLI).

The devas seek refuge with their mother, Aditi, at her Hermitage. She tells Indra &#x27;yourself and all the immortals cannot slay Virochana&#x27;s son, Bali. Only the thousand-headed Purusha is capable of slaying him and none else&#x27;. The devas and Aditi then approach Kashyapa, who agreeing with their desire to restore Indra&#x27;s throne, takes them to the celestial abode of Brahmaloka to speak with Brahma. Brahma advises them to seek Vishnu, and they do so &#x27;at the northern bank of the ocean of milk... Reaching that place called Amrita the Suras along with Kashyapa began to practice hard austerities for many years with a view to propitiate the thousand-eyed intelligent Yogin Narayana&#x27; (XLII).

Vishnu, pleased with the austerities of the devas, agrees to Kashyapa&#x27;s request to be born as Indra&#x27;s &#x27;younger brother, ever enhancing the joy of thy kinsmen and as the son of myself and Aditi&#x27;. Back at the Hermitage &#x27;filled with saints they [the devas] engaged in the study of the Vedas and awaited Aditi&#x27;s conception;. After a thousand years of pregnancy, Aditi, gives birth to Vamana, &#x27;the protector of the devas and the destroyer of the Asuras&#x27; (XLIII). Praised and Eulogised by the devas, Vamana agrees to attend the horse sacrifice of Bali with the Rishi Vrihaspati, and while there &#x27;will do what I think proper for regaining the three worlds&#x27;.

At the sacrifice Vamana &#x27;assumed the form of a boy, had smokey eyes, wore sacrificial thread well-polished, and deer-skin. He had an umbrella and staff in his hands. Although not aged he appeared like an old man&#x27;. Appearing to Bali, Vamana &#x27;of wonderful speech, with reasons and arguments laid down in the Vedas, but not visible to any, described himself unto Bali as being identical with sacrifice&#x27;. Astonished, Bali asks about Vamana and what He wants (XLIV). After describing the details and merits of the Ashvamedha sacrifice, Vamana requests three steps of land before Bali is warned by Shukra &#x27;do not promise him any gift... He is the Great Lord Hari. Having assumed the form of a dwarf through his Maya he has come here to impose on you for the well-being of the king of devas [Indra]&#x27;.

Bali, pleased that the Lord of Sacrifice has personally attended, rejects the protests of both Shukra and his grandfather Prahlada to gift three footsteps of land to Vamana, who then displays his Universal Form. Angry, the other Asuras approach Vamana &#x27;like insects going to a fire&#x27; (XLV). Increasing His gigantic form, Vamana smashes &#x27;all the sons of Diti with his palms and feet&#x27;. The Asura leaders are destroyed, the three worlds possessed &#x27;with his three-foot steps&#x27; are given back to Indra, and Bali is pleased to be assigned &#x27;the region under the earth called Sutala&#x27;. Bali is also conferred a boon where he will benefit from the merits of things like improper sacrifices and vow-less studies, etc. Vishnu divides the world, and later Narada and Garuda discuss Vishnu with Bali, bound by celestial serpents (XLVI).

===== Links to the Varaha incarnation =====

* Notably, the horse-sacrifice (Ashvamedha) is described as &#x27;the best of all sacrifices&#x27; and that this &#x27;great yajna [is in] the shape of a boar with golden horns, iron hoops and gait fleet like the mind, which has profuse gold and is the origin of the universe, is highly sacred&#x27;. This may link to the Varaha incarnation (Bhavishya Parva: XLV)
* Bali, after the three worlds were taken from him by the Vamana incarnation and stricken by the consequences, mentions Varaha lifting the Earth to Narada (Bhavishya Parva: XLVI)

=== Agni Purana ===


The first brief account of the legend of Vamana in the Agni Purana, consisting of only 7 verses (or Slokas), has been quoted above in full. Notably, despite only being two paragraphs in length, it seems to contain all the fundamentals of the legend (i.e. more elaborate accounts consisting of several chapters still follow the same steps or formula):

# Indra and the devas are defeated by Bali, the demonic king who now rules the three worlds 
# The devas ultimately seek refuge in Vishnu, who is born to Aditi as Vamana the Brahmin-dwarf, to defeat Bali 
# Vamana attends a Sacrifice being performed by the noble Bali, who ignores warnings about Vamana to knowingly grant three steps of land 
# Vamana repossesses the three worlds in three steps which are given to Indra who rules again, and Bali is sent to the Netherworld.

Other details include:

* Siddhasrama is stated to be &#x27;the place where Vishnu manifested as the Dwarf&#x27; (5.9)
* Images of Vamana, Narasimha, Hayagriva, and Varaha should be placed in the south-east, south-west, north-west, and north-east, respectively (43.2)
* Vamana is stated to bear &#x27;the Conch, Disc, Mace, and Lotus&#x27; (48.4)
* Agni details the means of worshipping Vamana, via observation of the &quot;Sravanadvadasi&quot; Vrata in the month of Bhadrapada (189.3-15)
* Of the 12 battles or wars between the Devas and Asuras, the first involved Narasimha, the second Vamana, and the third Varaha (276.10-11)
* Vamana should be worshipped at Kuruksetra (305.6)

=== Bhagavata Purana ===


The main account of the legend of Vamana in the Bhagavata Puran is narrated by Sukadeva Gosvami to King Pariksit (canto 8, chapters 15–22). Given its similarity to legends provided in the Harivamsa, as well as the Matsya, Vamana, and Skanda Purunas, it seems this account either shares a common source, or more likely (on the assumption the Bhagavata was written later) was derived from at least one of these other accounts. Quotes given below in the chapter summaries are taken from the chapter introductions provided by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (BBT) for conciseness.

After the Churning Of The Ocean Of Milk (see Kurma), Bali was defeated and killed by the Devas led by Indra, but was brought back by Sukracarya, who becomes his preceptor (or acarya; 11). After performing the Visvajit-yajna, and rebuilding his strength, Bali travels to the city of Indrapuri with his army for another battle with Indra, while &#x27;Brhaspati advised the demidevas to leave the heavenly planets and keep themselves somewhere invisible... [Then Bali], in performing one hundred asvamedha-yajnas... enjoyed the opulences of the heavenly planets&#x27; (15). Aditi, to help her son Indra, performs penances to propitiate Vishnu, as taught by Kashyapa (16). Krishna, &#x27;being very pleased by the &quot;payo-vrata&quot; ceremony performed by Aditi... agreed to become her son&#x27; (17).

After Vamana is born and assumes the form of a dwarf, the Jatakarma (birthday) and sacred thread ceremonies are performed. Vamana then visits the sacrificial arena [of Bali] on the northern side of the Narmada River, at the field known as Bhṛgukaccha, where brahmanas of the Bhrigu dynasty were performing yajnas... after washing the Lord&#x27;s feet, Bali Maharaja immediately accepted the water from the Lord&#x27;s feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified. Then Bali Maharaja inquired of Lord Vamanadeva&#x27;s welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or anything He might desire&#x27; (18).
Vamana praises Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa before asking for three footsteps of land. However, Sukracarya knows the dwarf is Vishnu acting on behalf of Indra, and so forbids Bali to gift anything (19). As it &#x27;is the duty of a householder to maintain the principles of religion... Bali Maharaja thought it improper to withdraw his promise... Lord Vamanadeva then immediately extended Himself into a universal body. By the mercy of Lord Vamanadeva, Bali Maharaja could see that the Lord is all-pervading and that everything rests in His body... The Lord gradually covered the entire surface of the world, and by extending His body He covered the entire sky. With His hands He covered all directions, and with His second footstep He covered the entire upper planetary system. Therefore, there was no vacant place where He could take His third footstep&#x27; (20).

Seeing Bali deprived of everything in two steps, angry demons attack Vamana, but are defeated and - on Bali&#x27;s order - are banished to the netherworld. Bali is arrested and bound with the rope of Varuna by Garuda, before Vishnu asks for the third step of land promised. However, as &#x27;Lord Vishnu appreciated Bali Maharaja&#x27;s determination and integrity, when Bali Maharaja was unable to fulfill his promise, Lord Vishnu ascertained that the place for him would be the planet Sutala, which is better than the planets of heaven&#x27; (21). Bali remembers the devotion of his grandfather, Prahlada, and so offers his head to Vishnu for the third step; pleased with this devotion, Krishna offers &#x27;His disc to protect Bali Maharaja&#x27; and promises to remain with him as a doorkeeper (22). Other details include:

* Vamana is the 15th overall incarnation of Krishna (1.3.19)
*Vamana is stated to have had a wife called Kirti with whom &#x27;He begot one son, named Bṛhatsloka, who had many sons, headed by Saubhaga&#x27; (6.18.8). Aiyangar states that Kirti means &#x27;Fame&#x27;, Brihat-soka means &#x27;great praise&#x27;, and Sanbhaga means &#x27;Happiness&#x27;. The only other mention of a wife is made in the Vishnu Puran, whose name there is stated to be Padma or Kamala (see below)
* According to the Brahmavaivarta Puran, Aditi performed a different ceremony to beget Vamana, called the &quot;Supunyaka Vrata&quot; (see below)
* The &#x27;kaccha&#x27; from &#x27;Bhrgukaccha&#x27; (8.18) refers to tortoises, as well as to soil
* Krishna informs his parents, Vasudeva and Devaki, that He was also previously their son as Vamana (also known as Upendra) when they were Kashyapa and Aditi (10.3.42)
* Bana, the eldest son of Bali, was a devotee of Shiva and &#x27;especially satisfied the lord by playing a musical accompaniment with his one thousand arms&#x27; (10.62.2)

=== Brahma Purana ===
==== First account ====
Although the first account of the legend of Vamana in Brahma Purana is brief and otherwise entirely typical in nature, it is notable that 20 of the 28 verses focus on detailing the names and attributes of the Asuras that either attacked and/or were destroyed by Vamana. The remaining 8 verses (or slokas) relay the legend itself, whereby Vishnu adopts the dwarf-form of Vamana, attends &#x27;the yajna of the powerful Bali&#x27;, crushes the demons in His gigantic form, and returns control of the three worlds to Indra.

==== Second account ====

The second account of the legend of Vamana consists of an entire chapter (Gautami-Mahatmya: 4; 68 verses). Narrated by Brahma to Narada, it differs from the usual accounts insofar as the devas led by Indra are &#x27;defeated&#x27; not in a literal battle, but rather by the good and noble qualities of the invincible Bali, under whose rule &#x27;there were no enemies, no ailments, no anxieties in any way.. While Bali was ruling over the kingdom, none of these was seen even in dream, viz. famine, evil, denial of God, [or] wickedness&#x27;. Jealous and miserable, the devas seek refuge in Vishnu, who states Bali is a devotee, &#x27;cannot be conquered by Devas or Asuras&#x27;, but can be bound &#x27;by means of words with miraculous power&#x27; to return the kingdom to them.
Vishnu enters the womb of Aditi and is born as the dwarf, Vamana. Assuming the form of a Brahmin, Vamana then attends the sacrifice of Bali &#x27;singing Saman verses&#x27;. The preceptor of the demons, Sukra - a descendant of Bhrgu - warns Bali and his wife about Vamana, and Bali responds &#x27;Blessed I am because the lord of sacrifices is coming to my house so unexpectedly&#x27;.

Vamana requests three steps of land, this is granted by Bali, and Vamana grows in size, covering all of existence in two steps, as quoted above. Pleased with Bali, Vamana offers a boon but Bali does not wish for anything. The three worlds are returned to Indra, and Bali and his family are sent to the netherworld.

=== Brahmanda Purana ===


A brief account of the legend of Vamana is provided in the Brahmanda Purana (Part 3: 73.75-87). It is notable as one of the few accounts where Bali is neither forewarned nor aware of the true nature of Vamana, or the consequences for gifting a three footsteps of land. In addition, while Bali and other &#x27;Asuras along with their sons and grandsons&#x27; are driven to Sutala by Vamana, the &#x27;cruel ones among them were [also] killed&#x27;. After the Devas, Danavas (including Bali), and human beings see the gigantic universal form of Vamana - containing the universe within it - the three worlds are bestowed back to the &#x27;noble-souled&#x27; leader of the Devas, Indra. Other details include:

* The tip of one of Vishnu&#x27;s toes, while He took the three steps to reclaim the three worlds from Bali, created the Ganges river (37.4-5)
* Of the 12 battles or wars between the Devas and Asuras, the first involved Narasimha, the second Vamana, and the third Varaha (72.73)
* Bali is described as &#x27;noble-minded&#x27; and as a &#x27;great Yogin&#x27; (74.26)

=== Brahmavaivarta Purana ===

The legend of Vamana quoted above seems to be unique to the Brahmavaivarta Purana (Krsna-Janma-Khanda: Chapter 47). In this account, Visvakarma is employed by Indra to rebuild the city of &quot;Amaravati&quot; after it is destroyed. A year later, with Indra still not satisfied and unable to return to his abode, Visvakarma seeks the help of Brahma. Brahma in turn seeks the help of Vishnu, who incarnates in the &#x27;form of a Brahmana boy... He wore a serene smile on his face which was quite charming&#x27;. Indra becomes arrogant and haughty after being asked about the length of time Visvakarma must be engaged, so as quoted above, Vamana points out there have been innumerable Indras in innumerable universes.
Countless thousands of ants appear, and Vamana states to Indra that every one of them was previously enthroned as an Indra. He adds that all the ants had achieved their positions - high and low - because of their Karmas, alone. A sage called Lomasa arrives later, and asked why a patch of hair was missing from his chest, states that he loses a hair every time an Indra dies. He adds that there have been innumerable Brahmas, and that yet with &#x27;the fall [death] of [a] Brahma, Vishnu winks but once&#x27;. Vamana - who turns out to be &#x27;Shiva in the form of Vishnu&#x27; - and Lomasa disappear. Indra, looking at &#x27;the whole scene like a dream&#x27;, is left more humbled and intelligent. Visvakarma is thus generously rewarded with riches for his work by Indra and sent back to his own abode.

A more typical account of Vamana is also provided elsewhere in the Purana. Quoted below, it is given as one of a series of examples where Indra becomes arrogant and so has his pride shattered by Vishnu (Indra&#x27;s pride and humbling is also the premise of other legends such as that of Kurma, the tortoise incarnation):

Other details include:

* It is stated that Bali consumes the sacrifices improperly performed (also stated in other texts such as the Harivamsa and Vamana Purana; Part 1: Prakrti-Khanda - 42)
* The &quot;Supunyaka&quot; Vrata (vow) is undertaken by women (&#x27;in the bright thirteenth day of the moon in the month of Magha&#x27;) to propitiate Krishna and through His favour beget a son; it is stated that Aditi performed the &quot;Supunyaka&quot; Vrata to get &#x27;a son who happened to be the dwarf incarnation&#x27; (Part 1: Ganapati-Khanda - 6); According to the Bhagavata Puran, Aditi instead performed the &quot;payovrata&quot; (see above).
* The Prajapati Sutapa and his wife Prsni pleased Vishnu so much with their tapas (religious austerities) that he agreed to be their son, including a second time as Vamana in their incarnations as Kashyapa and Aditi, and ultimately a third time as Krishna in their incarnations as Vasudeva and Devaki (Part 2: Krsna-Janma-Khanda - 7)
* Ratnamala, the daughter of Bali, &#x27;felt attracted towards Vamana and desired to have him as her son, she had thought in her mind that the son like him should be fed by her from her breasts&#x27;. Her wish was granted by Vishnu: incarnated as Putana, the demoness breastfed poison to baby Krishna before being killed (and therefore liberated) by Him (Part 2: 10 and 115)
* Shiva incarnated as a dwarf Brahmana - described almost identically to Vamana - when concerned for Parvati, who had grown weak due to practising austerities (Part 2: 40); this may be a reference to Vajasaneyi Samhita (White Yajurveda, Book 16, see above).

=== Garuda Purana ===


It seems that the legend of Vamana is only briefly mentioned in the Garuda Purana, such as in the example quoted above. Other details include:

* &#x27;Vamana&#x27; is one of the 1,000 names of Vishnu (Vishnu Sahasranama), as is &#x27;Balibandhanakrt&#x27; (&#x27;who fettered the demon bali&#x27;), Trivikrama (&#x27;having three steps&#x27;), and &#x27;Bali&#x27; (Part 1: 15.3)
* The Salagrama stone for Vamana &#x27;is circular and short&#x27; (Part 1: 45.20)
* Vamana is listed as fifth in Dashavatara, the ten principle incarnations of Vishnu (Part 1: 86.10-11)
* &#x27;Vamana&#x27; is one of the names of Vishnu to repeat at a sacred rite to take place &#x27;On the eighth day in the dark half mingled with the Rohini star&#x27; (Part 1: 131.3; 10–16)
* Bali is stated by Hari to be the son of Virocana, grandson of Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakasipu (killed by the Narasimha avatar of Vishnu), and to have had 100 sons of his own, the eldest being Bana (Part 1: 6.45-46)
* During the reign of the next (eighth) Manu called Savarni, Bali will be elected to the post of Indra (Part 1: 87.36)
* It is stated that the &#x27;idol of dadhivamana [Vamana] should have the size of [a] barely corn. It should be round, blue in hue, slender in proportion and of pleasant aspect. It should wield a pair of wheels, five gopuras, bow and arrow. It should be straight and round and adorned with a garland of wild flowers. It should contain a thousand heads, a silvery dot on the right side of the forehead and an auspicious semicircular mark on the left and the full moon in the middle. Such auspicious gifts are attended by good fortune to the donor&#x27; (Part 2: 26.63-66)

=== Kurma Purana ===


In the Kurma Purana, there are two accounts of Vamana.

==== First account ====
In the first account, following the part quoted above, Vamana covering all three worlds in three steps splits the cosmic egg, and the consequent flow of water rushing into it is &#x27;termed by Brahma&#x27; as the Ganges. Vamana then tells Bali that he will be banished to the netherworld until merging with Him at the time of dissolution (i.e. at the end of the Kalpa, which lasts 1,000 Yugas in total). Vamana gives the three worlds back to Indra before disappearing in front of everyone&#x27;s eyes. In the nether world, the devotee Bali seeks instruction from his grandfather, Prahlada, to worship and seek refuge in Vishnu (16.46-69).

Prahlada is also directly linked with the legend of Narasimha, the fourth (man-lion) incarnation of Vishnu, who killed Hiranyakashipu. Hiranyakashipu is the father of Prahlada, great-grandfather of Bali, and elder brother of Hiranyaksha. The latter was killed by Varaha, the third (boar) incarnation of Vishnu. Both Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha themselves are the first of three incarnations of Jaya and Vijaya, the doorkeepers of Vishnu cursed by the Four Kumaras.

==== Second account ====
In a second and much briefer account, it is stated that in &#x27;this Vaivasvata Manuvantra, Vishnu was born of Kashyapa and Aditi as Vamana. Winning the three worlds with his three steps, this high-souled lord gave in to Indra the triple world bereft of all obstacles... Since this entire world was entied by the high-souled Vamana, therefore he is called by all as Vishnu due to the root &#x27;Vis&#x27; (to enter) involved herein&#x27; (49.33-36). Vaivasvata, also known as &quot;Shraddhadeva Manu&quot;, is the current and seventh of fourteen total Manus that rule the current Kalpa in succession. Vaivasvata is also directly linked with the legend of Matsya, the first (fish) incarnation of Vishnu, who rescued him from the deluge at the end of the reign of the sixth Manu, &quot;Chakshusha&quot;.

=== Linga Purana ===


In the Linga Purana, the legend of Vamana is only briefly mentioned, as quoted above. Other details include:

* &#x27;Vamana&#x27; and &#x27;Trikrama&#x27; (&#x27;one who has taken three steps&#x27;) are listed as two of the 1,000 names of Shiva (Part 1: 65.54b-60)
* Matala, the netherworld or Hell, &#x27;is occupied by Ananta, Mucukunda and king Bali who is the resident of Patala and Svarga&#x27; (Part 1: 45.11)
*It is stated that &#x27;Omkara is identical with the three worlds, the three Vedas, the three sacrificial fires, the three steps of Vishnu, the three scriptures, viz. Rk, Samans and Yajur mantras&#x27; (Part 1: 91.52)
*Vamana is listed in the Dashavatara, or ten principle incarnations of Vishnu (Part 2: 48.31-32)

=== Markandeya Purana ===
It seems that in the Markandeya Purana, the legend of Vamana is not mentioned.

=== Matsya Purana ===


In the Matsya Purana, three chapters are dedicated to the legend of Vamana. It has elements and descriptions very similar to that of the Vamana Purana in particular. In this account, Shaunaka tells Arjuna that after Indra is vanquished by the Asuras, his mother, Aditi, &#x27;the mother of the Devas began to practise rigid austerities. For one thousand years she worshipped Lord Krishna by living on air alone, and on seeing Her children oppressed by the [Asuras] she said to Herself that Her sons were born in vain&#x27;. Vishnu, pleased with the devotion of Aditi, agrees to her request to restore Indra to power and states &#x27;I shall therefore be born of you through Kashyapa when I shall kill all the demons&#x27; (CCXLIV / 244).

After the demons lose their lustre, Bali enquiries from his grandfather and Devotee of Vishnu, Prahlada, what the reason is. Meditating on Hari, Prahlada has a vision of Vamana and informs Bali, who initially scoffs but apologises after being cursed as &#x27;indiscriminate, vicious and disrespectful&#x27;. Upon the birth of Vamana, &#x27;all the Devas, even the Demons, men, earth, heaven, [and the] sky became peaceful&#x27;, while Brahma prays and performs the appropriate birth ceremonies. Brahma gives Vamana a (Black) deerskin to wear, Vrihaspati the sacred thread, Marichi (Son Of Brahma) the Danda, Vasitha the Kamandala, Angira gives Kusa grass and the Vedas, Pulaha the Aksasutra (Rosary Beads), and Pulastya the white raiment. As Vamana proceeds to the sacrifice of King Bali, the &#x27;portion of the land on which Vamana put His feet in walking sank down and a deep hole appeared there and He made the whole world with all its mountains to oceans... quiver though He walked slowly&#x27; (CCXLV / 245).
Bali enquires from his preceptor Shukra why his sacrifices are not being accepted by Agni, and is informed Vamana is coming to the sacrifice. Although realising that Vishnu cannot be refused, Bali is still considers it &#x27;uncommon good fortune that the Lord, for whose sake various asceticism, gifts, sacrifices, etc., are performed&#x27; will accept his offering in person. Bali offers any riches or any amount of land Vamana chooses, but is requested to give only three steps.

Upon agreement, Vamana &#x27;spread His vast Form and He measured the earth in the twinkling of an eye&#x27;, and spreading over the three worlds, &#x27;killed the great Asuras for the benefit of the Devas&#x27;. Vamana gives the three worlds to Indra and the nether regions to Bali, with the promise that after &#x27;Vaivasvata Manu [7th and current ruling Manu] is succeeded by Savarni Manu, you will become Indra [i.e. King Of The devas]&#x27;. Vamana also mentions that as Bali in &#x27;ancient times&#x27; had worshipped Him most devoutly, he can go to live in Patala, &#x27;abounding in excellent gardens, palaces, luxuriant flowers, lakes, rivers&#x27; etc. Vamana then vanishes (CCXLVI / 246). Other details include:

* The oldest of Bali&#x27;s 100 sons is Bana, who had 1,000 arms (VI.6-10 / 6.6-10)
*Bali reigned for 20,080,000 years (XLVII.55-57 / 47.55-57)
* The queen of Bali is &quot;Vindhyabali&quot; (CLXXXVII.38-42 / 187.38-42)
* The place where Bali performed sacrifices is called &quot;Ilavrita Varsa&quot;, &#x27;famous as being the birthplace of all the Devas&#x27; (CXXV.1 / 135.1)
* Shuka states &#x27;O Prahlada, your grandson, King Bali, will reign with all glory, in different realms for, even, Lord Vishnu will promise this secretly to your grandson, when He will deprive him of his kingdom in His Dwarf incarnation... Shiva, the most supreme Lord of the entire universe, has spoken to me, as a secret, that Bali will be the future King of the Devas [i.e. Indra], and therefore He, invisible to all, is awaiting that time, O Prahlada&#x27;. (XLVII.213-244 / 47.213-244)
* It is stated &quot;&quot;Namah Karanavamanya&quot; on the fore of the teeth [is] sacred to [the] Svati asterism and [the] Vamana (Dwarf) incarnation&quot; (LII.18 / 52.18)

=== Narada Purana ===

In the Narada Purana, the legend of Vamana is given in chapter eleven. The (anonymous) translator in footnote 12 to this chapter (p. 208) states that the &#x27;gift of land has been highly praised as the most meritorious, from ancient times. Apararka quotes many verses from the Visnudharmottara Puran, the Aditya Purana and Matsya Purana... and states that there is no gift comparable to the gift of land. Verses pertaining to land-grant are common not only in Puranas or Smrti works but are recorded on inscriptions and copper-plates of such grants all over India&#x27;.

In this account, Vishnu visits and offers Aditi a boon, being pleased with her penances. Aditi requests that her sons, the Devas, be restored to power, but without &#x27;any harm unto [the] Daityas, since they too are my sons&#x27; (i.e. via her sister and co-wife of Kashyapa, Diti). Vishnu agrees, and promises to be born as her son, Vamana. Praised by Kashyapa upon His birth before taking &#x27;leave of his mother and father, that Brahmana bachelor Vamana, went over to the great sacrifice of the supremely affluent Daitya Bali], that was being performed&#x27;. Sukra warns Bali and advises him not to give anything to Vamana, but Bali refuses, stating &#x27;O preceptor, you should not tender such advice which is contrary to the path of virtue. If Visnu himself partakes of oblations or gifts, what can be better than that?&#x27; Vamana arrives, is greeted by Bali in reverence, and explains the virtues of gifting lands to Brahmanas with the story of Bhadramati before asking for &#x27;a plot of land measuring three steps&#x27;. As Bali takes up a pitcher of water to offer the land, Sukra attempts to obstruct the flow of water to prevent the offering, but Vamana uses the tip of Kusa/Darbha grass to touch the spout of the pitcher and completes it.

&#x27;Vishnu, that Soul of the Universe began to grow in size till he reached the abode of Brahma&#x27;, and taking three steps, pierces the crust of the Cosmic Egg. The water that flows in and washes His feet &#x27;thereby became pure and sanctified the world... It was served as resorted by the seven sages (The Ursa Major). Then it fell on the top of mount Meru&#x27; to become the Ganges. The three worlds are thus return to the Devas, Bali is given Rasatala &#x27;along with all his Asuras&#x27;, and Vamana goes to a &#x27;forest for performing penance&#x27; (11). Other details include:

* On the Dvadasi day in the bright half of the month of Asadha, one should fast and worship Vamana, who &#x27;is the bestower of intellect&#x27; (e.g. Part 1: 17.59-61, Part 4: 120.36b-41a)
* Chapter 10 details the defeat of the Devas by Bali, where the Asuras also attempt to convince Aditi to stop her penances to Vishnu (Part 1: 10)
* During the eighth &quot;Manvantara&quot; (i.e. reign of the 8th of 14 total Manus in this Kalpa; currently we are ruled by the seventh) thanks &#x27;to the power of the Puja of Vishnu, Bali is remembered as their Indra [i.e. King of the devas]&#x27; (Part 1: 40.30)
* &#x27;Bali&#x27; is mentioned as a food offering (rice ball) in sacrifices several times throughout (e.g. Part 2: 51.82b-83 and Part 3: 70.24-27)
*Vamana is stated to have been &#x27;installed by all the Devas&#x27; at Kotitirtha (Part 5: 65.29b-30a)

=== Padma Purana ===


In the Padma Purana, two accounts of the legend of Vamana are given.

==== First Account ====
The first is related by the sage Pulastya to Bhishma (Part 1: chapter 30), which took place &#x27;formerly in the Satya Yuga&#x27;. Similar to the legend of Vritra in the Bhagavata Puran, Baskali (i.e. Bali) conquers the devas led by Indra after attaining the boon of invincibility from Brahma, forcing them to ultimately seek Vishnu for refuge. Vishnu agrees to help, and Aditi (Wife Of Kashyapa) is pregnant for 1,000 divine years with the Vamana incarnation. It is noted that Aditi &#x27;entertained a malicious design&#x27; to destroy the demons during her pregnancy.

At &#x27;the time as ordained, the god, the lord of lords (i.e. Visnu), kind to all beings, of pure and scanty hair, having the beauty of the moon, the conch and the (sun-) rise, became (i.e. was born as) Aditi&#x27;s son&#x27;. Vamana later travels with Indra to the city of Baskali to request three steps of land. To the amazement of Indra, in the city there &#x27;was no religious merit, no lore, no architecture, no art that did not exist (i.e. that was not found)&#x27;, and even the Vedas were being recited by &#x27;virtuous demons&#x27;. Baskali himself &#x27;was conversant with righteousness, was grateful, truth-speaking, and had his senses controlled&#x27;.

Delighted, Baskali compares seeing Indra to sacrifices like the Agnistoma and Rajasuya. Indra praises Baskali and requests three steps of land for the dwarf-brahmin to have a fire-sanctuary to make sacrifices. Baskali praises and surrenders to Vamana as Vishnu who &#x27;has performed a hundred sacrifices endowed with excellent sacrificial fees&#x27;, adding that Vishnu &#x27;killed Vrtra Namuci&#x27; (a legend also related to the development of the Narasimha incarnation). Although advised by Sukra to gift nothing to Vamana or else face total destruction, Baskali considers himself lucky to be able to surrender to Vishnu and wants to give everything. Indra repeats that only three steps of land are requested, and &#x27;Baskali then gave (the piece of land measured by) three (foot-) steps to the dwarf, after (pouring) water (on his hand), saying &#x27;Let Hari himself be pleased with me&#x27;.

The first step of Vamana is on the sun, the second is on Dhruva (the polar star), and the third reaches outside the universe. Water rushing in through the crack in the edge of the universe caused by the tip of Vishnu&#x27;s toe becomes the river Visnupadi (i.e. the Ganges), an auspicious and holy river. Vishnu offers Baskali a boon, and is requested only for increased devotion and a death at His hands in order to enter the realm even &#x27;inaccessible to the ascetics&#x27;. Vishnu agrees and promises to kill Baskali when they incarnate and battle as Varaha and Hiranyaksha, respectively. Otherwise, after being deposed, &#x27;Baskali lived happily in the netherworld [while] Indra also protected the three worlds&#x27;.

==== Second account and other details ====
The second account, narrated by Mahadeva (i.e. Shiva), is much shorter and more typical in nature. In this, Vamana is implored by the devas to visit the sacrifice of Bali to request the three worlds from him. Vamana, this time alone without Indra, is greeted and worshipped by Bali, explains the merit of donating land, and requests three steps, which is granted despite the protests of Sukra. Vamana then &#x27;abandoned his dwarfish form... extending up to fifty crores (of yojanas) he seized the earth along with the seas and mountains, along with the oceans, islands, devas, demons and human beings&#x27;. As Vishnu places his second and third steps, creating the sacred Ganges in the process, Bali is granted the ability to see his universal &#x27;Janardana-form&#x27; (similar to that witnessed by Arjun in the Bhagavad Gita). Other details include:

* The &#x27;three objects&#x27; (Trivarga) of worldly existence specified by Baskali (i.e. Bali) are Dharma, Artha, and Kama (Part 1: 30.94)
* &#x27;Vamana&#x27; is listed as one of the hundred names of Vishnu (Part 3: 87.10-24)
* Vamana &#x27;removed, with the auspicious glances, the sin of Bali... lord Vamana, shining in the group of Brahmanas at the head of the sacrifice, adorned with Brahmanic glory (Part 4: 98.52-78)
*Vamana should be worshipped - amongst other devas - during Amalaki Ekadasi (Part 7: 45.49-52)
*In the Hymn called &#x27;Apamarjana&#x27;, Vamana is assigned to &#x27;the roots of the ears&#x27; (Part 7: 78.16.29)
*The &#x27;round and small&#x27; salagrama stone is called &#x27;Vamana&#x27; (Part 8: 120.51b-73)
*Vishnu as Vamana is stated to dwell in Holy places called Kanyakubja and Vamanatirtha (Part 8: 133.2-12 and 160)
*Reference is made to a sage called Vamana who, amongst others, served Shiva due to the grace of Ganesha (Part 8: 138.1-15)
*Vamana is listed in the Dashavatara, the ten principle incarnations of Vishnu (Part 7: 66.44-54, 71.23-29, and Part 9: 229.40-44)

=== Shiva Purana ===


It seems that the legend of Vamana is only briefly mentioned in the Shiva Purana. The translator, J.L.Shastri, notes in the fourth part (page 1659, footnote 93) that &#x27;Patala is called Balisadman - the abode of Bali. According to a legend God Vishnu in the form of a Brahman dwarf craved from Bali the boon of three steps of ground and having obtained it stepped over heaven and earth in two strides but then out of respect to Bali&#x27;s devotion and his grandson Prahlada&#x27;s virtues, he stopped short and left to him Patala, the nether region&#x27;. However, Prahlada is actually the grandfather of Bali (being the son of Hiranyakashipu), not his grandson as incorrectly stated by Shastri. Other details include:

* Bali conquering the devas led by Indra is a prelude to the legend of the Kurma incarnation, where the Devas and Asuras form a pact to churn of the ocean of milk (Part 2: 15). Bali is present at the churning where a &#x27;great battle for the possession of Amrta ensued between the devas and the Asuras&#x27;, and after gaining possession of it, where Vishnu incarnates as Mohini to give the Amrita to the devas (Part 3: 22)
* Aniruddha (incarnation / grandson of Krishna) sneaks into the residence of Bana (son of Bali) to form an alliance with Usa (daughter of Bana; Part 2: 51–53). This legend is repeated in other Puranas such as the Srimad Bhagavatam.
* The eldest son of Bali, Bana &#x27;became a devotee of Shiva. He was highly respected and intelligent&#x27; (Part 1: Rudra-Samhita: 51.14-15)
* There is a mountain called Vamana (Part 3: Uma Samhita: 18.47)
*Hiranyaksipu, Hiranyaksa, Virocana (Bali&#x27;s father) &#x27;and Bali worship Shiva every day&#x27; (Part 4: Kotirudra-Samhita 37.18); the exception is Prahlada (son of Hiranyaksipu, father of Virocana, and grandfather of Bali) who does not worship Shiva but instead worships Vishnu
* Vamana is listed in the Dashavatara, the ten principle incarnations of Vishnu (Part 4: Vayaviya-Samhita: 30.56-58 and 31.134-136)

=== Skanda Purana ===


Notably, this above-quoted incident is not mentioned in either of the two legends of Vamana given in the Skanda Purana.

==== First account ====
In the first account (part 1, chapters 18–19), after being defeated by the Daityas (led by Bali), the shamed Suras (led by Indra) disguise themselves as different animals and go to the hermitage of Kashyapa and Aditi for refuge. Aditi wishes to help the Suras, so on the advice of Kashyapa, she performs the &quot;Ekabhakta&quot; rite for Vishnu for a year (details and instructions are provided, including the most auspicious timings and star constellations). Pleased with Aditi&#x27;s holy penance, Janardana (Vishnu), on &#x27;the Dvadasi day which coincided with [the] Sravana constellation [appeared in] the form of a Brahmacarin (religious student). He was two-armed and had lotus-like eyes. He had the colour of the flower of Atasi (Hemp). He was adorned with a garland of sylvan flowers&#x27;.

Pondering how to defeat the Daityas, Vamana first orders his gada (mace) to kill Bali, but it replies that this is impossible as Bali is &#x27;a great Brahmanya (well-versed in the Vedas, friendly and hospitable to Brahmanas)&#x27;. His discus and Sarnga bow give the same reply when ordered to kill Bali, too: &#x27;Just as you are Brahmanya, O Vishnu, so is this great Daitya [called Bali] also&#x27;. Meanwhile, the Daityas conquer heaven (abandoned by the Suras) and install Bali on Indra&#x27;s throne. Bali&#x27;s previous life as a sinful gambler is recounted, before it is revealed Aditi completed her Vrata (vow) - upon which Vamana, &#x27;Aditi&#x27;s son in the form of a great religious student&#x27; appeared  - just before Bali&#x27;s 100th horse-sacrifice.

At the sacred thread ceremony performed by Kashyapa for Vamana, Brahma gives the sacred thread, Soma gives the staff, the Earth gives two sandals, and Bhavani gives alms. Also given a girdle and deer-hide by unknown parties, Vamana proceeds to Bali&#x27;s next sacrifice. Although Bali is willing to give the Brahmin the whole earth, Vamana requests only three steps of land, before Sukra warns Bali that the religious student (&#x27;Batu&#x27;) is Vishnu in disguise, and in relation to the Kurma incarnation, that Vishnu had previously incarnated as Mohini to take the Amrita away from the Daityas to give to the Suras (Chapter 18).

In the next chapter, Bali states that he intends to give whatever is asked as &#x27;Lord Hari, the soul of everyone has come here out of sympathy for me, in order to redeem me&#x27;. Sukra curses Bali for ignoring his advice and retreats to a Hermitage. There is no mention of Sukra attempting to block the offering or losing his eye. Vamana takes two steps, the first covering the earth and the second all existence; the water used by Brahma to wash the foot of Vishnu that took the second step produces the Ganges. Vamana returns to His original size, and through Garuda, admonishes and binds Bali for only gifting two steps, not three as promised (since all existence had been covered in only two). Vindhyavali, Bali&#x27;s wife, sees through this ruse and offers the heads of Bali, her son Bana, and herself for Vishnu to step on. Delighted, Vishnu releases Bali from his bonds, instructs Bali to rule in Sutala, and offers a boon. Bali states &#x27;I do not wish for anything except your lotus-like feet, O Lord&#x27;. Vishnu promises to be Bali&#x27;s gatekeeper forever, and all &#x27;the beggars and mendicants of the three worlds went to Bali. Visnu who stood at the entrance to his abode, granted to them whatever they desired to get&#x27;. The account then ends with a eulogy to Shiva, by whose favour &#x27;that Bali became thus&#x27; (i.e. happy and blessed; Chapter 19).

==== Second account and other details ====
In the second account (part 12, chapter 63, verse 237 onward), after the request of the devas granted a boon by Vishnu, Vamana is born &#x27;as the delighter of Aditi&#x27; some time later. At this time Bali was performing &#x27;a hundred horse sacrifices with a desire to take away the kingdom of Indra&#x27;. Vamana, singing &#x27;the Mantras of all the four Vedas&#x27;, arrives at Bali&#x27;s sacrifice officiated by figures such as Kashyapa and Bhrgu. Announced by the doorkeepers, Vamana is taken by Bali to the centre of the hall, and asked His reason for coming as well as whatever He may desire.

Vamana requests three steps of land. Bali offers much more, but Vamana repeats he wishes for three steps of land. Against the advice of Bhrgu (Sukra in the first account), this is granted by Bali, and &#x27;Hari immediately occupied the cosmos. The entire region of [the] earth including mountains, forests and jungles was covered by two and a half [footsteps]&#x27;. Having conquered the Asuras, Vamana gives the three worlds back to Satakratu (Indra) and returns to earth. The remainder of the chapter concerns the merits of the Vamana Tirtha (holy site) related to this legend. Other details include:

* The city of Bali in Patala (i.e. the netherworld) is called Bhogavati (Part 3: Purvardha: 11.14)
* The 12-month &quot;Jyesthapancaka Vrata&quot; to Vishnu is described in detail, including mention of Vamana (Part 5: 44.12)
*Bali requests from Vamana that if &#x27;people offer lamps to Naraka [Hell] on the fourteenth day [of Dipavali, the festival of lights], all their forefathers shall cease to be in Naraka&#x27; (Part 6: Karttikamasa-Mahatmya - 9.49b-60)
*In the procedure for Puja Mandala Construction for Vishnu worship, Vamana, along with the Gautama Buddha, should be installed at &#x27;the front of the eastern filament... both of them dark as a cloud (in complexion), compassionate, quiescent, celibate, wearing sacred thread and white garments, holding a full bloomed lotus in the right hand, [and] the left hand indicating &quot;Abhaya&quot; (protection from fear) by its position&#x27; (Part 7: Vaisakhamasa Mahatmya: 27.25-26)
*When the murti of Vamana is installed in the house &#x27;he makes people prosperous&#x27; (Part 11: Uttarardha: 61.220)
*Vamana is listed in the Dashavatara, the ten principle incarnations of Vishnu (Part 15: Reva Khanda: 151.1-7)
*Bali is to take the position of Indra during the reign of the eighth Manu (Part 18: Nagara Khanda: 273.4-6)

=== Vamana Purana ===


There are two main accounts of the legend of Vamana in the Vamana Purana. At least 18 chapters relate directly to Vamana and events or characters relating to the legend. H.H. Wilson summarises the legend of Vamana in this Purana as &#x27;the birth of Krishna as a dwarf, for the purpose of humiliating Bali by fraud, as he was invincible by force. The story is told as usual; but the scene is laid at Kurukshetra&#x27;. This somewhat curt summation is fundamentally inaccurate and misleading since Bali is neither humiliated nor defrauded. As a general rule, Bali is a noble-souled and religious character fully aware of exactly who Vamana is and who knowingly grants three footsteps of land in spite of being warned of the consequences. This is the case in both accounts contained in the Vamana Purana, where far from being &#x27;humiliated&#x27;, Bali is installed as ruler of the netherworlds and is promised the post of Indra (i.e. King of the devas).

==== First account ====

The first account is remarkably similar to that of the Matsya Purana (see above), and consists of 9 chapters (Saromabatmya: 2-10). It begins with the coronation of Bali as the King after defeating Indra. Noble and religious, Bali is congratulated for his victory and blessed by Sri (2). Meanwhile, Indra returns to his mother, Aditi, who states Bali can only be defeated by Vishnu. Aditi and the devas go to Kashyapa, &#x27;the creator of beings, the Supreme Master of the entire progeny&#x27; who then takes them to Brahmaloka, the celestial abode of Brahma (3).

Brahma informs the devas that the three worlds will be delivered by &#x27;Him who is the Lord of all the worlds, the eternal master of the universe, and the First born they call the Primordial First Deity. Even the devas do not know who the Great One is&#x27;. From there the devas travel to &#x27;the northern bank of the Ksiroda Ocean, in the northern direction, where the Creator of the universe is present... the region known as Amrta&#x27;. There, knowing &#x27;Lord Narayana, the thousand-eyed god&#x27; could only be realised through spiritual union, practiced holy vows and recited the Vedas for 1,000 years (4). Kashyapa also eulogises Vishnu by reciting many of His names, including &#x27;Devadeva&#x27; (&#x27;God of devas&#x27;) and &#x27;Prasitara&#x27; (&#x27;the Eater of the oblation at the sacrifice&#x27;) and states the importance of sacrifice (5).

Narayana agrees to the request of Kashyapa to &#x27;be born as the younger brother of Indra, the promoter of the happiness of the relatives, and the dear son of Aditi&#x27;. Returning to the Hermitage of Kashyapa, Aditi then performs penances for 10,000 years (6). Pleased with her penance Vishnu appears, agrees to Aditi&#x27;s wish to restore her son Indra to power, and becomes conceived in the womb (7). After the demons lose their lustre, Bali enquiries from his grandfather and Devotee of Vishnu, Prahlada, what the reason is. Meditating on Hari, Prahlada has a vision of Vamana and informs Bali, who scoffs and is consequently cursed as for his disrespect towards &#x27;the all-pervasive, supreme spirit&#x27; (8). Bali apologises, is forgiven by Prahlada, and accepts he will lose his kingdom as a result of the curse. Meanwhile, Vamana is born to Aditi after 10 months of pregnancy. Brahma performs the Jatakarma ceremony and other rites before gifting a black deer skin, Brhaspati the sacred thread, Marici the Asadha staff, Vasistha a Kamandalu, Angiras a silken cloth, and so on. The dwarf then proceeds slowly to the sacrifice of Bali, His footsteps leaving hollows in the earth (9).

Bali is warned by Sukra about the arrival of Vamana, and advised to refuse any request made. Bali responds that he could not refuse the Lord of Sacrifices even if he wanted to, and considers himself very fortunate the Lord is arriving to his Yajna personally. Bali offers Vamana &#x27;a gift of anything that belongs to me&#x27; and Vishnu requests &#x27;three strides for a Fire Sanctuary [Altar]&#x27;. Bali agrees and as &#x27;soon as water fell in his palm the Dwarf assumed non-dwarfish dimensions and showed instantly his form, comprehending all devas&#x27;. In three steps Vamana regains the three worlds which are returned to Indra, while Bali is promised to become Indra on &#x27;the expiry of the Vaivasvata period&#x27; (i.e. end of the rule of the seventh Manu); until then, he is to rule in Sutala, &#x27;crowded with hundreds of palaces and provided with comforts necessary for devas&#x27;. The remainder of the chapter concerns the importance of sacrifices, and the merits achieved by Bali though improper practices of others, such as &#x27;sacrifices performed without faith&#x27; (10).

==== Second account ====
The second account - excluding chapters not directly related to the legend, such as Bali conquering the devas beforehand and the pilgrimage of Prahlada after cursing Bali - consists of at least 5 chapters (Saromabatmya: 50–51, 62, and 64–65). In this, Indra travels to Brahmaloka to confer with Brahma and Kashyapa, where he is told that he lost his Kingdom due to his sin of attempting to destroy the fetus of Diti (saved by Vishnu), another wife of Kashyapa and mother of the Daityas. Indra performs penances, of which he tells his mother, Aditi. Aditi in turn performs penances, and pleased, Vishnu agrees to be born as her son (i.e. Vamana) to restore Indra to power (50). Similar the first account, Bali is warned about the birth of Vamana and cursed after failing to take the threat seriously, albeit this time by his grandfather Prahlada (not Sukra), who then goes on a pilgrimage (51).

Vamana is born, and eulogised by Brahma who performs the Upanayana and Jatakarma ceremonies and others. Pulaha gives the sacred thread to Vamana, Pulastya two white garments, Agastya a deer skin, Bharadvaja a girdle, Marici a staff, Vasistha (son of Varuna) rosary beads, Angiras a broom of Kusa grass, King Raghu an umbrella, Nrga a pair of shoes, Brhaspati a water-jar, and so on. Vamana states &#x27;I will go to Kuruksetra which confers great prosperity. There the sacred Asvamedha Sacrifice of the king of demons [Bali] is going on&#x27; (62).

Sukra advises Bali not to give anything to Vamana. This advice is rejected by Bali, who relates the story of Nisakara &#x27;the son of Kosakara, which took place on the Malaya Mountain in olden days&#x27;. It is similar to the legend of Bharat, insofar as it concerns a person that having remembered their previous births, pretended to be mentally-handicapped, and suffered mistreatment by others as a result, in order to &#x27;no longer commit terrible sins with my mind, actions and speech&#x27; (64). Vamana arrives at the sacrifice of Bali and requests three steps of land. Bali offers much more but Vamana again repeats &#x27;Give me three steps; I do ask for this much only&#x27;. Bali agrees, and just &#x27;as the water (of the pitcher) fell on the hand (of Vishnu) he assumed a divine, multifarious, world-embracing form for the purpose of pervading the three worlds&#x27;. In two steps, Vamana covers all existence and creates the Ganges. Vamana then tells Bali he must &#x27;supply my (remaining) step or accept captivity&#x27;. Bali&#x27;s son, Bana, sees through the ruse and points out Vishnu could traverse all of existence in a single step despite being in the small form of a dwarf.

Vishnu responds that His three steps were also for the benefit of Bali, and to the King directly, says, &#x27;O King, till my honorarium is paid, you go and live free from diseases in the subterranean region called Sutala (good-surfaced) which is highly beneficial&#x27;. As in the first account, Vishnu also states that improper sacrifices will also benefit Bali while resident in the netherworld, in addition to other sacred rituals such as Dvara-pratipada. Then, &#x27;having restored heaven to Indra, and enabling the devas to enjoy their shares in sacrifices, the omnipotent Lord of the universe disappeared&#x27; (65).

=== Varaha Purana ===


In the Varaha Purana, it seems that the legend of Vamana is only briefly mentioned, as quoted above. Other details include:

* Vamana is one of the 10 primary incarnations (Dashavatar) of Vishnu (Part 1: 4.2-3, 113.42 and Part 2: 211.69)
* In &#x27;the month of Caitra (Mesa), Visnu should be worshipped on Dvadasi day after due fasting. The feet should be worshipped as Vamana&#x27; (Part 1: 43.1-2)
* Worship of Vamana removes &#x27;all stupefaction&#x27; (Part 1: 48.18)
*It is said that the &#x27;only means for redemption for those who are ignorant and indifferent to dharma and do not have compassion or give gifts, is to perform worship and sacrifice to Lord Vamana at the confluence at Mathura when the star Sravana is in combination with Dvadasi in the month of Bhadrapada&#x27; (Part 2: 174.53-54)

=== Vayu Purana ===


In the Vayu Purana, the legend of Vamana is briefly recounted in the second part (36.74-85), an excerpt of which is quoted above. A simplified version of the legend (in comparison to many others), after Vamana takes back the three worlds from the Asuras, &#x27;he forced them to retreat to the bottom of the nether-world along with their sons and grandsons. Namuci, Sambara and Prahlada (were among them). The cruel Danavas were killed&#x27;. Bali is also stated to have been &#x27;bound with great nooses along with his kinsmen, friends, and followers&#x27;.

The previous two incarnations of Vishnu prior to Vamana are stated to be Varaha and Narasimha. Notably, deviating from incarnations typically listed, the fourth listed (occurring in the tenth Treta Yuga) is Dattatreya, the fifth (fifteenth Treta Yuga) is Mandhatr, the sixth (nineteenth Treta Yuga) is Parashurama, and the seventh (twenty-fourth Treta Yuga) is Ram. Other incarnations following Rama have not been listed here. Other details include:

* The sons of Bali &#x27;established the disciplines of four castes on this earth&#x27; (Part 2: 37.26-32) 
* There are two different Balis. The first is Mahabali, the rival of Indra conquered by Vishnu/Vamana in three steps. The second is &#x27;another East Indian King who being childless requested [progeny] thus to Dirghatamas&#x27; (Part 2: 37, footnote 1, page 796). The anonymous translator notes that the Vayu Puran seems to mix-up or confuse these two Balis in chapter 37 (i.e. Mahabali was not childless)
* It is stated that &#x27;He who was formerly Bali, the son of Virocana, will become their [the devas] Indra&#x27; (Part 2: 38.21-22)
* It is stated that a son of Bali, Cakravarma, will be incarnated as Karn, one of the main villains of the Mahabharata (Part 2: 7.32)

=== Vishnu Purana ===


It seems that the legend of Vamana is only briefly mentioned in the Vishnu Purana. According to the notes of the translator, H.H. Wilson, &#x27;Fuller details occur in the Bhagavata Purana, Kurma, Matsya, and Vamana Purana&#x27;. However, it is stated in the above quotation that Vamana had a wife called Padma or Kamala, an incarnation of His eternal consort Lakshmi. The only other mention of a wife is made in the Bhagavata Purana, whose name was Kirti (meaning &#x27;Fame&#x27;, see above).

==Sangam Literature==

Several texts of the Tamil Sangam literature such as &quot;Mullaippāṭṭu&quot; and &quot;Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai&quot; mention Vishnu&#x27;s incarnation of Vamana, addressed as Trivikrama, referring to his act of spanning the Earth.

== Festivals ==
===Balipratipada===
Balipratipada is an ancient festival observed during the five days of Diwali that amongst other things commemorates the Bali-Vamana legend. The legend signifies devotion, goodwill and generosity.

===Onam===
In one version of the Vamana legend, when Mahabali offered himself for Vishnu&#x27;s third step, it was an act of Mahabali&#x27;s devotion. Vishnu granted him a boon. Mahabali chose to revisit earth, once every year, the lands and people he previously ruled. This revisit marks the festival of Onam, as reminder of the virtuous rule and his humility in keeping his promise before Vishnu.

A simpler form of this legend, one without Mahabali, is found in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and the Vedic text &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; where a solar deity is described with powers of Vishnu. This story likely grew over time, and is in part allegorical, where &quot;Bali&quot; is a metaphor for thanksgiving offering after a bounty of rice harvest during monsoon, and &quot;Vishnu&quot; is the metaphor of the Kerala Sun and summer that precedes the Onam. The story of Mahabali is important to Onam in Kerala, but similar Mahabali legends are significant in the region of Balia in Uttar Pradesh, Bawan also in the same state, Bharuch in Gujarat, and Mahabaleshwar in Maharashtra. The story is significant not because Mahabali&#x27;s rule ended, but it emphasizes the Hindu belief in cyclical nature of events, that no individual, no ruler and nothing lasts forever, except the virtues and self understanding that overcomes all sorrow.

== Iconography ==
Vamana iconography varies by region. Three icons are common, one shows his left foot raised above his knee, the second shows his foot above his navel, and the third shows it raised above the forehead. These icons respectively symbolize the three worlds – netherworld, earth and heaven – Vamana covered as Trivikrama.

== Temples ==

The Vamana iconography and images are found in many Vaishnava temples. Some Vamana temples include:
* Vamana temple at Marhia, Jabalpur (dated to 5th-century, Gupta Empire era)
* Vamana temple in Nagpur complex of Ramagiri Temples, Maharashtra (5th-century CE)
* Vamana along with other avatars of Vishnu, at the Dashavatara Temple, Deogarh, Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh, dated 500-500 CE)
* Thrikkakara Temple, Thrikkakkara, Cochin, Kerala
* Velloor Sree Vamana Swamy Temple, Kottayam, Kerala
* Mithranandapuram Vamanamoorthy Temple, Thrissur, Kerala
* Mathampilly Vamana Murthy Temple, Chelamattom, Ernakulam, Kerala
* Thrivikramamangalam Mahavishnu (Vamana) Temple, Thirumala, Thiruvananthapuram (Protected monument)
* Ulagalantha Perumal Temple, Kanchipuram in Kanchipuram
* Vamana Temple, Eastern Group of Temples, Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh
* Ulagalantha Perumal Temple, Tirukoyilur in Tirukoilur, Viluppuram District, Tamil Nadu
* Kazheesirama Vinnagaram in Sirkazhi, Tamil Nadu
* In Jagannath Puri Temple the tower of the main sanctuary has three subsidiary shrines, Varaha on south, Narasigha on west and Vamana on north. The high relief Vamana Dev intricately describes the incident of Bali.

<doc id="100141" wikidata="Q3342265" url="?curid=100141" title="Level 7 (novel)">
<text>Level 7 is a 1959 science fiction novel by American writer Mordecai Roshwald. It is told from the first-person perspective (a diary) of a modern soldier, X-127, living in the underground military complex Level 7, where he and several hundred others are expected to reside permanently. X-127 fulfills the role of &#x27;push-button&#x27; offensive initiator of his nation&#x27;s nuclear weapons capacity against an unspecified enemy. X-127 narrates life within a deep shelter before, during and after a nuclear war that wipes out the human species.

==Plot summary==
During his forced residence at a deep underground offensive-warfare complex, X-127 is ordered to push missile firing buttons to begin World War III (which lasts a total of 2 hours and 58 minutes). From that point, humanity&#x27;s few civilian survivors are situated within a collection of underground shelter complexes on Levels 1 through 5 at various depths from the irradiated surface, while military personnel already occupy the deepest and safest Levels 6 and 7. It later emerges that the orders given have been wholly automatic due to a launch on warning strategy; the war has taken place as a series of automated electronic responses to an initial accident.

X-127 and his fellow shelter inhabitants belatedly learn the criteria that had determined admission to the shelters: civilians were granted only an illusion of protection, while government officials and military personnel were granted significantly more security. Those who were assigned to launch the nuclear missiles, and their support staff, were selected for their ability to behave like machines, yet are counted upon to preserve the human spirit and rebuild the human race. X-127 and his colleagues attempt to carry on human life, but discover that institutions such as marriage and preparations for child-rearing have been hollowed out by conditions and attitudes in the antiseptic underground.

Toward the end of the novel, the inhabitants of surviving shelters within collaterally hit neutral nations, the former enemy nation and the unnamed protagonist nation gradually meet their deaths as radioactive surface contamination makes its way down past air filters and into water sources in the ground. As Level 7&#x27;s safety falls into question, its inhabitants confront their growing isolation, overconfidence in technology, loneliness below a dead world, and the insanity of a society whose momentum toward annihilation exceeded its collective will to live. At last, the inhabitants of &quot;Level 7&quot; are wiped out after a malfunction in their nuclear power pile results in lethal contamination of their erstwhile sanctuary. They are apparently the last human beings on Earth to perish, and X-127 is the very last one at the story&#x27;s conclusion. The extinction of humanity has taken four months from the time that the missiles were first fired.

==Structure==
The book is apparently written in such a way to discourage the reader from determining which side is which. References to democracy are structured as to be just as applicable to Soviet democracy as to British or American democracy. The book contains no geographical references or individual names, but does use non-metric measurements. It is left to the individual reader to determine if this indeed identifies a Western setting or merely reflects the author&#x27;s background. In any case, specific national identities are arguably irrelevant to the book&#x27;s themes of dehumanization, the abstraction of nuclear warfare, and the danger that this leads to when combined with the destructive potential of the weapons involved. The novel thus acts as a warning against the nuclear arms race, as the original (but later removed) postscript makes clear:

Originally, the manuscript contained a preface by Martian archaeologists, who discover the diary amongst the ruins of a destroyed Earth. However, this was removed in editions published before 2003 because it was felt that it spoiled the ending of the book.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Level 7&quot; was adapted by J. B. Priestley for a 1966 episode of the BBC2 television science-fiction drama programme &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;. It had originally been written as a feature film adaptation, but was cut down to fit into the show&#x27;s one hour time slot. It has been released on DVD with all other extant episodes of the series.

It was also adapted specifically for young students as a one-hour radio play and broadcast in 1980 by , the Swedish national radio theatre, under the Swedish title &quot;Nivå 7&quot;.

==Reception==
Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1961 rated &quot;Level 7&quot; 4.5 stars out of five, stating that X127&#x27;s story &quot;has the strange unreality and impact of the too intense reality&quot;.

<doc id="100143" wikidata="Q7111800" url="?curid=100143" title="Out of the Unknown">
<text>Out of the Unknown is a British television science fiction and horror anthology drama series, produced by the BBC and broadcast on BBC2 in four series between 1965 and 1971.

Most episodes of the first three series were dramatisations of science fiction short stories. Some were written directly for the series, but most were adaptations of published stories. The first three series were exclusively science fiction, but that genre was mostly abandoned in the final year in favour of horror-fantasy stories, with only one story based around science-fiction.

Many videotapes of episodes were wiped in the early 1970s, as was standard procedure at the time. A large number of episodes are still missing, although some have resurfaced: for example, &quot;Level Seven&quot;, an episode in series two originally broadcast on 27 October 1966, was returned to the BBC from the archives of a European broadcaster in January 2006.

==Origins==
Irene Shubik had been a science fiction fan since she was at university. In 1961 she suggested to Sydney Newman, then head of the drama department of ABC Television, an ITV franchise contractor, that the company create a science fiction version of &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;. This became &quot;Out of this World&quot;, a sixty-minute anthology series hosted by Boris Karloff that ran for thirteen episodes between June and September 1962. Many of the episodes were adaptations of published short stories by writers including John Wyndham, Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick.

==Series one==

Shubik began work and soon found that gathering science fiction stories suitable for adaptation was a difficult task. She later recalled: &quot;I had to read hundreds of stories to pick a dozen. You have no idea how difficult some of these authors are to deal with, and it seems a special thing among SF writers to hedge themselves behind almost impossible copyright barriers, even when they have got a story that is possible to do on television. So many you can&#x27;t. Either the conception is so way out you would need a fantastic budget to produce it, or the story is too short, too tight to be padded out to make an hour&#x27;s television&quot;. When she had been working on &quot;Out of this World&quot; Shubik had made a valuable contact in John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction publishing. He was the founder of the science fiction magazine &quot;New Worlds&quot; and agent for many of Britain&#x27;s science fiction writers. Carnell was able to suggest stories and authors for her to consider. Shubik also received copies of science fiction anthologies from British publishers and sought advice from many authors, including Frederik Pohl, Alfred Bester and Robert Silverberg. The latter two admitted to her that they had run into similar difficulties in finding suitable material for television adaptation. She considered asking Nigel Kneale if he would write a new Quatermass story for the series, and contacted Arthur C. Clarke regarding the possibility of adapting his novel &quot;The Deep Range&quot;.

In March 1965 Shubik travelled to New York City to negotiate rights with authors whose works she was considering, to seek ideas from U.S. television, and to obtain more science fiction anthologies from U.S. publishers. During her visit she met science fiction editors and also Isaac Asimov, who granted permission for two of his stories to be adapted on the condition that they could be shown only in the UK: sales to foreign territories were not allowed. A visit to New York became an annual event for Shubik during her time on &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;.

On her return to London from her first visit Shubik learned that she had been appointed producer and story editor for the new anthology series. She obtained the services of George Spenton-Foster as her associate producer. Spenton-Foster was a science fiction fan and his wide experience of BBC television production proved invaluable to Shubik.

By this stage she had found the twelve scripts she needed for the first series: ten episodes were adaptations of stories by John Wyndham (&quot;Time to Rest&quot; and its sequel &quot;No Place Like Earth&quot;, dramatised together as &quot;No Place Like Earth&quot;); Alan Nourse (&quot;The Counterfeit Man&quot;); Isaac Asimov (&quot;The Dead Past&quot; and &quot;Sucker Bait&quot;); William Tenn (&quot;Time in Advance&quot;); Ray Bradbury (&quot;The Fox and the Forest&quot;); Kate Wilhelm (&quot;Andover and the Android&quot;); John Brunner (&quot;Some Lapse of Time&quot;); J. G. Ballard (&quot;Thirteen to Centaurus&quot;) and Frederik Pohl (&quot;The Midas Plague&quot;). Two original stories were also commissioned, &quot;Stranger in the Family&quot; by David Campton and &quot;Come Buttercup, Come Daisy, Come...?&quot; by Mike Watts. Among those commissioned to adapt the stories were a few notable names in television writing. Terry Nation, creator of the Daleks for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and later of &quot;Survivors&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, adapted Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Fox and the Forest&quot;, while Troy Kennedy Martin, co-creator of &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, adapted Pohl&#x27;s &quot;The Midas Plague&quot;.

A title for the series had not been decided when production began. Titles such as &quot;Dimension 4&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;From the Unknown&quot; were considered before &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; was settled on. The title music was composed by Norman Kay and the title sequence was created by Bernard Lodge. It was intended from an early stage that, as with Boris Karloff on &quot;Out of this World&quot;, each story would be introduced by a regular host. Christopher Lee and Vincent Price were approached, but neither was available and the idea was dropped.

The opening title sequence was designed by Bernard Lodge, using stock shots and specially created optical illusion patterns filmed on a rostrum camera, combined with a face frozen in a scream and a mannequin falling repeatedly through space. The forty-second sequence won a Design &amp; Art Direction Wood Pencil for Television Graphics in 1965. Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop created a theme for the sequence, but it was rejected.

The episode &quot;Some Lapse of Time&quot; is notable for having Ridley Scott, future director of such films as &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, as its designer.

&quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; made its debut on BBC2 at 8 p.m. on Monday 4 October 1965 with &quot;No Place Like Earth&quot;. Science fiction and fantasy were popular on television, and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, &quot;The Man from UNCLE&quot; and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; were all notable hits at the time. &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, however, was intended to offer more cerebral fare. Initial audience and critical reaction was mixed, but improved as the series went on. &quot;Andover and the Android&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s not until intelligence, humour and gaiety break into television that you notice what tasteless pap we&#x27;ve been living on&quot; – &quot;Daily Mail&quot;) and &quot;Some Lapse of Time&quot; (&quot;It was not surprising to hear from &quot;Late Night Line Up&quot; that there had been many complimentary telephone calls after the play [...] it left the viewer with the disconcerting feeling that there was more than a grain of truth in its fantasy&quot; – &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail and Dispatch&quot;) proved particularly popular with audiences and critics alike. BBC2 Controller David Attenborough praised the &quot;overall professionalism that has become a hallmark of the series&quot;. By the end of its first run &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; was the second-most popular drama on BBC2, after the imported Western &quot;The Virginian&quot;.

Series one holds the distinction of being the only series to have its first and final broadcast episodes still in existence. Series three and four are missing both, while series two is missing its final episode.

==Series two==
In parallel with preparing for the second series of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; Shubik was producing another anthology series, &quot;Thirteen Against Fate&quot;, comprising adaptations of short stories by Georges Simenon. To assist her she was assigned a script editor, initially Rodney Gedye and then, after Gedye left following clashes with Shubik, Michael Imison. As with series one, finding suitable stories for adaptation remained a problem. On her annual visit to New York Shubik placed an advertisement looking for stories in the Science Fiction Writers Association Bulletin. One author who answered the advertisement was Larry Eisenberg, whose stories &quot;The Fastest Draw&quot; and &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot; were commissioned. Two further adaptations, of E.M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;The Machine Stops&quot; and Mordecai Roshwald&#x27;s &quot;Level 7&quot; (dramatised as &quot;Level Seven&quot;), were scripts that had been offered to film studios for some years without success. Another script, adapting Colin Kapp&#x27;s &quot;Lambda 1&quot;, had been commissioned for series one but shelved, owing to the technical problems it involved. When the special effects designer Jack Kine indicated that he had a solution to the technical challenges, the script was brought back into production for series two. Five further adaptations were commissioned: John Rankine&#x27;s &quot;The World in Silence&quot;, Henry Kuttner&#x27;s &quot;The Eye&quot;, Frederik Pohl&#x27;s &quot;Tunnel Under the World&quot; and Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot; and &quot;Reason&quot; (dramatised as &quot;The Prophet&quot;). Three original stories were also commissioned: &quot;Frankenstein Mark II&quot; by Hugh Whitemore, &quot;Second Childhood&quot; by Hugh Leonard and &quot;Walk&#x27;s End&quot; by William Trevor.

In response to Kenneth Tynan&#x27;s use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; on the satirical programme &quot;BBC-3&quot; Sydney Newman issued directives to his producers regarding language and content. In the case of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; this led to particular attention being paid to the scripts for &quot;Second Childhood&quot; (about reawakening of sexual desire when an elderly man undergoes a rejuvenation process) and &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot; (about a woman taking a robot as a lover). The theme music was given a faster pace.

Series two was broadcast on Thursday nights at 9:30 p.m., beginning with the episode &quot;The Machine Stops&quot; on 6 October 1966. The new series was promoted by the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, then owned by the BBC, with a front cover photograph of Yvonne Mitchell, star of &quot;The Machine Stops&quot;, and an article previewing the upcoming episodes written by Michael Imison. The two most notable productions of the series were &quot;The Machine Stops&quot; and &quot;Level Seven&quot;. &quot;The Machine Stops&quot;, directed by Philip Saville, was a particularly challenging production, later described by Shubik as &quot;the most complex and technically demanding script I have ever had in my hand&quot;—requiring large and complex sets, including construction of one with a working monorail. The adaptation was met with good reviews (&quot;A haunting film – and a deeply disturbing one&quot; – &quot;The Times&quot;) and was awarded first prize at the Fifth &quot;Festival Internazionale del Film di Fantascienza&quot; (&quot;International Science Fiction Film Festival&quot;) in Trieste on 17 July 1967. Due to the expected complexities of editing, the episode was recorded onto 35mm film instead of videotape, and still exists as this original film negative. It is the only episode produced during the show&#x27;s black and white era that exists in its original broadcast format.

&quot;Level Seven&quot; was adapted by J. B. Priestley and directed by Rudolph Cartier. Priestley&#x27;s script had begun life as a potential screenplay for a feature film and condensing it down to &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;&#x27;s standard running time of 50 minutes proved impossible. In the end Shubik convinced the management of the BBC to allow &quot;Level Seven&quot; to run to 60 minutes as a one-off. Reviewing &quot;Level Seven&quot; in &quot;The Listener&quot; (also then owned by the BBC), J. C. Trewin wrote that &quot;the tension was inescapable, the excitement incontestable, more so, undoubtedly, than other thrusts into the future&quot;. The robot costumes created for &quot;The Prophet&quot; were later reused in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Mind Robber&quot;.

Despite its positive reception, only four of the thirteen episodes are known to survive.

==Series three==

Shubik was in the middle of her third visit to New York in early 1967 when she received a call from Sydney Newman offering her the opportunity to co-produce, with Graeme McDonald, BBC1&#x27;s most prestigious drama slot, &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;. Shubik accepted the new post, but insisted that she be given time to commission a full third series of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; scripts before moving on to &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; and handing &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; over to a new production team. At the same time Michael Imison also moved on to produce &quot;Thirty Minute Theatre&quot;.

For series three Shubik commissioned dramatisations of stories by Robert Sheckley (&quot;Immortality, Inc.&quot;); Isaac Asimov (&quot;Liar!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; (the sequel to &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, which Shubik had dramatised for &quot;Story Parade&quot; in 1963)); John Brunner (&quot;The Last Lonely Man&quot;); Clifford D. Simak (&quot;Beach Head&quot; and &quot;Target Generation&quot;); John Wyndham (&quot;Random Quest&quot;); Cyril M. Kornbluth (&quot;The Little Black Bag&quot;); Rog Phillips (&quot;The Yellow Pill&quot;) and Peter Phillips (&quot;Get Off My Cloud&quot;). Original stories were provided by Donald Bull (&quot;Something in the Cellar&quot;), Brian Hayles (&quot;1+1=1.5&quot;) and Michael Ashe (&quot;The Fosters&quot;). Two scripts, &quot;The Yellow Pill&quot; and &quot;Target Generation&quot;, had previously been used in Shubik&#x27;s earlier anthology series &quot;Out of this World&quot;.

In September 1967 Alan Bromly and Roger Parkes were appointed as, respectively, the new producer and script editor. Bromly and Parkes both had backgrounds in thriller series. A new opening title sequence was implemented, essentially a green and orange colourisation of the original. This was created when colourisation was a relatively uncommon process, particularly for television, so the results of each image vary.

Series three, the first series of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; to be made in colour, was broadcast on Wednesday nights beginning on 7 January 1969 with &quot;Immortality, Inc.&quot; One viewer of this episode was George Harrison of the Beatles, who can be seen discussing the episode with his bandmate Ringo Starr in the film &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Scheduled opposite the very popular ITV drama series &quot;The Power Game&quot;, the series suffered in the ratings and met with mixed reviews. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; found the series &quot;most erratic&quot;, sometimes &quot;wonderfully inventive&quot; but at other times &quot;as silly as a comic strip in a child&#x27;s magazine&quot;. The production of &quot;Random Quest&quot; led John Wyndham, the author of the story it was based on, to write to its director Christopher Barry praising &quot;the hard work and ingenuity of a great number of people concerned [...] excellent work by everybody – not forgetting the adapter. My thanks to everyone [...] for weaving it all together so skillfully.&quot; &quot;Beach Head&quot; was entered into the Sixth &quot;Festival Internazionale del Film di Fantascienza&quot; in July 1968, in the hope of repeating the earlier success of &quot;The Machine Stops&quot;, but did not win.

&quot;Get off my Cloud&quot; included Doctor Who&#x27;s prop of the TARDIS exterior and the scenes were recorded in August 1968.

Series three is the most incomplete season of the show. While several clips and audio recordings exist for the missing episodes, only one episode, &quot;The Last Lonely Man&quot;, exists in its entirety as its original colour videotape master. &quot;The Little Black Bag&quot; exists only partially, since roughly 20 minutes of footage, mainly from the first act, is missing.

==Series four==

The fourth series of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; began production in early 1970. Encouraged by the BBC&#x27;s Head of Plays, Gerald Savory, Bromly and Parkes sought to recast the show as &quot;not straight science fiction, but with a strong horror content, all starting out from a realistic basis&quot;. The decision to move towards psychological horror came about partly because of the difficulties involved in finding suitable science fiction scripts, partly because the production team felt that their budgets could not compete with those of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; or &quot;Star Trek&quot; (the latter had just begun to be broadcast in the UK at this time), and partly because it was felt that science fiction could not compete with the real-life drama of the Apollo Moon landings then occurring.

Another major change for series four was a move away from adapting novels and short stories. Only one episode of series four, &quot;Deathday&quot;, based on a novel by Angus Hall and dramatised by Brian Hayles, was an adaptation. The opening title sequence was changed again, designed by Charles McGhie, employing a variety of techniques, from computer-generated images to real-time visual effects and stop-frame model animation. The music used was &quot;Lunar Landscape&quot; by Roger Roger.

Series four was broadcast on Wednesday nights beginning on 21 April 1971. Both ratings and critical reception were positive, although some viewers were disappointed by the move away from hard science fiction – a typical comment was that of Martin J. Pitt, who wrote to the &quot;Radio Times&quot; that &quot;it will be a pity if the opinions of people like Alan Bromly rob television of the opportunity to present intelligent and exciting science fiction&quot;. &quot;To Lay a Ghost&quot; was a particularly controversial production at the time due to its &quot;somewhat questionable&quot; depiction of rape and sexual repression.

Although the fourth series was judged to be a success, the BBC chose not to renew &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; for a fifth series. With the exception of the &quot;Play for Today&quot; spin-off &quot;Play for Tomorrow&quot;, no regular lengthy science fiction anthology series has been made by a UK broadcaster since &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; went off the air (in 1981 Ian Levine planned a 13-part fifth series, but nothing came of it). Of the eleven episodes produced during its final year, only five are known to exist, with the first and final episodes missing.

==Episode list==
==Archive status==
Of the forty-nine episodes of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; only twenty survive in their entirety, mainly from series one.

=== Background ===
Until 1978, when the BBC Film and Videotape Library was created as a permanent archive for all its television programmes, the BBC had no central archive. The videotapes and film recordings stored in the BBC&#x27;s various libraries were often either wiped or discarded for recording new programmes and to free storage space to reduce costs. The BBC Film Library kept only some programmes that were made on film, while the Engineering Department handled videotape but had no mandate to retain material. Some shows were kept by BBC Enterprises, but they too had limited storage space and kept only material that was considered commercially exploitable. In the mid-1970s BBC Enterprises disposed of a lot of older material for which the rights to sell the programmes had expired, and the Engineering Department routinely wiped videotapes in an era when rescreening potential was limited.

The wiping policy officially came to an end in 1978, when the means to further exploit programmes by taking advantage of the new market for home VCRs started to become apparent. The prevailing view had also begun to shift toward the attitude that archive programmes should, in any case, be preserved for posterity and historical and cultural reasons. The BBC Film Library was turned into a combined Film &amp; Videotape Library for the preservation of both media.

=== Recovery ===
After the archive purge ended in 1978 only 17 episodes of the series were retained. Series 1 has fared remarkably well, with the fortuitous retention of ten 16 mm film telerecordings made for the purposes of overseas sales. These were discovered at Villiers House, alongside several 60s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes. Of the other seven, one episode was from Series 2, one episode from Series 3, and five episodes from Series 4, all retained in their original broadcast format (&quot;The Machine Stops&quot; in 35 mm telerecording in the Brentford library, and the rest in 625 line colour 2-inch Quadruplex videotape).

Recovery of the missing episodes had often been in the form of clips, either audio or video. The recovered visual clips from series 3 and 4 were in black and white since they were from 16 mm t/r of the episodes for overseas broadcast. They were restored in 2014 using Richard Russell&#x27;s colour recovery process, which uses colour signal information (commonly referred to as chroma dots) embedded in the 16mm black and white film recordings, to recreate the colour part of the original signal.

* A 2½-minutes section of &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot; survived, courtesy a 28/12/67 edition BBC-1 science documentary series Towards Tomorrow entitled Robot.
* The fourth-series episodes &quot;The Last Witness&quot; and &quot;The Uninvited&quot;, both of which are missing, were remade as episodes of &quot;Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense&quot; – respectively as &quot;A Distant Scream&quot; and &quot;In Possession&quot; – and broadcast in the UK in 1986.
* Around the same time, Ian Levine discovered &quot;Lambda 1&quot; which was returned.
* Parts of an almost 2½ minutes segment of the series 3 episode &quot;Liar!&quot; resurfaced for the first time after the archive purge in a 1997 Future Fantastic documentary series edition &#x27;I Robot&#x27;.
* In late January 1999, during the BBC&#x27;s then systematic D3 conversion of its archived videotapes, the b/w extant recording (with colour signals retained) of series 3 episode &quot;The Little Black Bag&quot; was discovered. Having started work on the regional archives, the fragments turned up on an engineering training tape held in the Glasgow holdings of BBC Scotland. The videotape recording starts mid-way, just after Full has cured Angie of the facial scars inflicted on her by a criminal gang she has become involved with. The recovered material begins after this &#x27;eyeline shot&#x27; of the gang moving to the rear of the room, with the recording then capturing the action up to third-last scene when Angie tragically demonstrates the medical kit&#x27;s instruments to a suspicious Mrs. Coleman. Unfortunately, the last thirty seconds of the play were missing from the recording.
* The two missing episodes of the mostly extant first series have end-credits sequences extant on a 1965 BBC Graphics Department showreel, recovered by BBC engineer Steve Roberts in the late nineties.
* Around the same time, 6 audio fragments of the episode &quot;The Prophet&quot; and 5 audio fragments of the episodes &quot;Get Off My Cloud&quot; (both having &quot;Doctor Who&quot; connection) begun started circulating. Both sets of clips originated from the fairly extensive reel-to-reel tape collection of SF fan Trevor Wells, which also thankfully contained 3 clips from &quot;Second Childhood,&quot; 2 short clips from &quot;The Fastest Draw&quot;, 1 long clip from &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot;, 4 clips from &quot;Immortality Inc.&quot;, 2 clips from &quot;Liar!&quot;, 12 clips from &quot;Something In The Cellar&quot;, 2 clips from &quot;Random Quest&quot;, 4 clips from &quot;The Little Black Bag&quot;, 4 clips from &quot;1+1=1.5&quot;, 6 clips from &quot;The Fosters&quot; and 5 clips from &quot;Target Generation.&quot; (Probably the surviving audio clips of second season originate from the repeat broadcast of &quot;The Machine Stops&quot;, &quot;Level 7&quot;, &quot;Second Childhood&quot;, &quot;The Fastest Draw&quot;, &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot; and &quot;The Prophet&quot; on BBC 1 in early 1967.) Trevor used an Elizabethan LZ34 recorder and he was able to reuse many of his old tapes to record new tracks at a slower speed. In each case, Trevor recorded only fragments of the broadcast plays as ‘snapshots’ of the various stories; in any case, he found that the cost of tapes prevented him from recording the plays in their entirety. Despite the relative quality of several of these recordings having deteriorated over the years, Trevor&#x27;s &#x27;snapshots&#x27; currently remain the only known record of many missing episodes.
* In 2002, a complete off-air recording of the penultimate episode &quot;The Uninvited&quot; was discovered. It was made on 15 August 1972 by fan Martin Townley, during Series 4 repeat broadcast on BBC2 in 1972. A number of other episodes (including &quot;The Chopper&quot;) were also recorded, although &quot;The Uninvited&quot; is the only one to have survived. It was the first complete audio recording of any &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; episode to be discovered.
* In early 2003, a complete recording of &quot;The Yellow Pill&quot; was discovered. The existence first came to light, when archive TV enthusiast Mark Slater had an opportunity to sift through approximately 70 reel-to-reel audio tapes owned by his friend Keith Underhill, a SF fan who had routinely taped various television broadcasts since 1968 (including that of &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; and &quot;Liar!&quot; which were unfortunately wiped).
* Off-screen photographs, called tele-snaps, which were taken by John Cura exist from the missing episodes &quot;The Fox and the Forest&quot;, &quot;Andover and the Android&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein Mark 2&quot;, &quot;Second Childhood&quot;, &quot;The Eye&quot;, &quot;The Fastest Draw&quot;, &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot;, &quot;Walk&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot; and &quot;The Prophet&quot;. These were published in Mark Ward&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Unknown: A guide to the legendary BBC series&quot; in 2004. A complete set of Tele-snaps from Series 3, when loaned by Alan Bromly&#x27;s wife to an interested party, went missing. And no telesnaps exist for Series 4, which was produced after John Cura&#x27;s death.
* In 2004, &quot;Tunnel Under the World&quot; was found in a private collection. The return of the episode to the archive was apparently a lengthy process, as the collector who had it had apparently tried to contact BBC about the episode back in 2001.
* In circa 2005, it emerged that the BBC sound archives already held recordings of &quot;Beach Head&quot; and &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;, the latter having 4 minutes 20 seconds missing. To date, there is no information on their origin or how long they had been held in the archive, although it can obviously be inferred that the recording of &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; stems from its one and only broadcast in the UK during February 1969.
* A b/w clip of the series 3 episode &quot;Random Quest&quot; (featured in a 22/10/70 &quot;Nationwide&quot; interview of Roberta Gibbs) was located by BBC archivist Andrew Martin in September 2005, following a lead from engineer James Insell. Next year, a new adaptation of the same story was made for BBC Four and broadcast on 27 November 2006 as part of that channel&#x27;s &quot;Science Fiction Britannia&quot; season.
* The episode &quot;Level Seven&quot; was returned to the archive as a film copy by a European broadcaster in 2006, shown at the British Film Institute South Bank in August 2009.
* All the series aired in Australia from September 1967 to 1973 in b/w since colour TV appeared in Australia for the first time in 1975. Transmission began with Time in Advance. Unfortunately contractual limitations entailed that the Season 2 and 3 Asimov stories weren’t part of the package. Last showing in Australia was The Sons and Daughters Of Tomorrow. Often, the overseas viewing prints were physically edited for content by local censor boards, before transmission for reasons such as excessive violence, fright-inducing material. In 2017, 2 b/w censor clips, each from &quot;Immortality Inc.&quot; and &quot;The Last Witness&quot; were discovered.
Neither any audio and/ or video extracts nor any tele-snaps exists from the Series 4 episodes &quot;Taste of Evil&quot;, &quot;The Sons and Daughters of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;The Chopper&quot; and &quot;The Shattered Eye&quot;. The only remains from these episodes are some production stills and brief summaries of these episodes.

=== Home video releases and future ===
Plans were made in 1990s to release two episodes from the series on VHS, but the plan was shelved.

All surviving episodes of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, as well as reconstructions (the first three–&quot;Beach Head&quot;, &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; and &quot;The Yellow Pill&quot;– were reconstructed using original audio, publicity photos and CGI, while &quot;The Uninvited&quot; has the surviving audio has been synchronized to a copy of the camera script due to the lack of photographs and &quot;The Little Black Bag&quot; has some sections reconstructed with the audio segments mentioned above) and clips of some of the missing episodes (except that of &quot;Immortality Inc.&quot; and &quot;The Last Witness&quot;), were released on DVD by the BFI on 24 November 2014 (delayed from 27 October), with audio commentaries and interviews with cast and crew, a new documentary called &quot;Return of the Unknown&quot;, extensive stills galleries, and a fully illustrated booklet with essays by show expert Mark Ward with full episode credits.

As mentioned above, Isaac Asimov granted permission for his stories to be adapted on the condition that they could only be shown in the UK: sales to foreign territories were not allowed. Of the six adaptations of Isaac Asimov stories, only two from Series 1 survive. With the rest four being not aired outside UK, the recovery of the missing Asimov episodes from overseas sources remains unlikely.

It is alleged that Beach Head was transferred to b/w 35 mm film to allow it to be shown from a cinema projector in Italy but that may have never been returned.

32 episodes from Series 1, 2 and 3 (except the Asimov stories) screened in New Zealand (in black and white of course since colour television was formally introduced to New Zealand in 1973–1975 and the episodes aired till circa 1970), then the prints were sent to various overseas stations such as Finland in October 1968 and February 1970, Hungary in February 1969, Sweden (March 1970), Sierra Leone (December 1971) and Yugoslavia in June 1973. However the episodes from Season 3 &quot;Something In the Cellar&quot;, &quot;Random Quest&quot;, &quot;Little Black Bag&quot;, &quot;1+1=1.5&quot;, &quot;The Fosters&quot;, &quot;Yellow Pill&quot;, &quot;Target Generation&quot;, &quot;Get Off My Cloud&quot; (all from Season 3) have no &quot;fate&quot; recorded against them in the TVNZ archive files, so it is possible these might still exist somewhere in New Zealand.

Some uncertainty still surrounds the fate of the last episodes of Series 4, &quot;The Chopper&quot; and &quot;The Shattered Eye&quot; apparently documented as being dispatched to Dubai in the 1976 but not returned. Some BBC records continue to list these as still extant, suggesting a hope in the future.

The BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, a public appeal campaign, continues to search for lost episodes.

<doc id="100144" wikidata="Q1258978" url="?curid=100144" title="Klismaphilia">
<text>Klismaphilia (or klysmaphilia), from the Greek words (&quot;enema&quot;, from , &quot;deluge, flood&quot;) and (&quot;love&quot;), is a paraphilia involving enjoyment of, and sexual arousal from, enemas.

==History==
The term &quot;klismaphilia&quot; was coined in 1973 by Joanne Denko, an early investigator in this field, in her article &quot;Klismaphilia: Enema as a Sexual Preference: Report of Two Cases,&quot; to describe the activities of some of her patients, whom she referred to as &quot;klismaphiliacs&quot;. &quot;Klismaphile&quot; has come into use as a synonym for klismaphiliac.

==Manifestation==
Klismaphiles might gain pleasure from a large, water distended belly or the feeling of internal pressure. An enema fetish may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, environments, situations, or scenarios, and some may be sexually aroused by the preparations, such as by the feel and smell of a latex rubber or plastic syringe, by the smell of soapsuds enema solution, or by preparing the recipient. Often, klismaphiles report discovering these desires after a chance administration of an enema sometime in their childhood, but some do report discovering these feelings later on. Klismaphiles can gain satisfaction of enemas through fantasies, by actually receiving or giving one, or through the process of eliminating steps to being administered one (e.g., under the pretense of being constipated). Usually, klismaphiles carry out normal lives and successfully engage in this behavior secretly.

An enema can be an auxiliary to, or a substitute for, genital sexual activity.

That some women use enemas while masturbating was documented by Alfred Kinsey in &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot;: &quot;There were still other masturbatory techniques which were regularly or occasionally employed by some 11 percent of the females in the sample... Douches, streams of running water, vibrators, urethral insertions, enemas, other anal insertions, sado-masochistic activity, and still other methods were occasionally employed, but none of them in any appreciable number of cases.&quot;

Sadomasochistic activities may incorporate enemas for erotic humiliation or for physical discomfort. BDSM punishment scenes can involve administering an enema in a manner that is humiliating and painful and for producing pain and cramps an extra-large volumes or highly irritating substances can be injected. Among the attractions to enema play in BDSM are erotic humiliation, dominance and submission, discipline, psychodrama, power exchange, and so on. An erotic enema allows acting out vulnerability in a primal form.

==Classification==

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) classifies klismaphilia under the diagnosis of &quot;Paraphilias, Not Otherwise Specified&quot;. The diagnostic code is 302.9. Proactive treatment for klismaphilics is not generally recommended, due to the lack of any significant desire to be &quot;cured&quot;. Health treatment for klismaphilia thus is typically only focused on ensuring the techniques employed and chemicals used are not harmful to the practitioner. Caution should always be maintained on the part of the practitioners experimenting with new techniques and concoctions; in certain cases cramps produced by the chemicals used have led to hospitalizations, in other circumstances the effects can even be life-threatening.

<text>A secret service is a government agency, intelligence agency, or the activities of a government agency, concerned with the gathering of intelligence data. The tasks and powers of a secret service can vary greatly from one country to another. For instance, a country may establish a secret service which has some policing powers (such as surveillance) but not others. The powers and duties of a government organization may be partly secret and partly not. The person may be said to operate openly at home and secretly abroad, or vice versa. Secret police and the FBI can usually be considered secret services.

Various states and regimes, at different times and places, established bodies that could be described as a secret service or secret police – for example, the &quot;agentes in rebus&quot; of the late Roman Empire were sometimes defined as such. In modern times, the French police officer Joseph Fouché is sometimes regarded as the primary pioneer within secret intelligence. Among other things, he is alleged to have prevented several murder attempts on Napoleon during his time as First Consul (1799–1804) through a large and tight net of various informants.

<doc id="100156" wikidata="Q103774" url="?curid=100156" title="Ravi Shankar">
<text>Ravi Shankar (; born Robindro Shaunkor Chowdhury, sometimes spelled as Rabindra Shankar Chowdhury; 7 April 1920 – 11 December 2012) was an Indian sitarist and composer. A sitar virtuoso, he became the world&#x27;s best-known expert of Indian classical music (in Sitar) in the second half of the 20th century, and influenced many musicians in India and throughout the world. Shankar was awarded India&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1999. He is also the father of American singer Norah Jones and British-American musician and sitar player Anoushka Shankar.

Shankar was born to a Bengali family in India, and spent his youth as a dancer touring India and Europe with the dance group of his brother Uday Shankar. At age 18, he gave up dancing to pursue a career in music, studying the sitar for seven years under court musician Allauddin Khan. After finishing his studies in 1944, Shankar worked as a composer, creating the music for the &quot;Apu Trilogy&quot; by Satyajit Ray, and was music director of All India Radio, New Delhi, from 1949 to 1956. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for scoring the blockbuster &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982).

In 1956, Shankar began to tour Europe and the Americas playing Indian classical music and increased its popularity there in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Beatles guitarist George Harrison. His influence on Harrison helped popularize the use of Indian instruments in Western pop music in the latter half of the 1960s. Shankar engaged Western music by writing compositions for sitar and orchestra and toured the world in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992, he served as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Parliament of India. He continued to perform until the end of his life. He was a recipient of numerous prestigious musical accolades, including a Polar Music Prize and four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot; in 1973.

== Early life ==
Shankar was born on 7 April 1920 in Benares (now Varanasi), then the capital of the eponymous princely state, in a Bengali Hindu family, as the youngest of seven brothers. His father, Shyam Shankar Chowdhury, was a Middle Temple barrister and scholar who was originally from Jessore district in Bengal (now Narail district, Bangladesh). A respected statesman, lawyer and politician, he served for several years as &quot;dewan&quot; (Prime Minister) of Jhalawar, Rajasthan, and used the Sanskrit spelling of the family name and removed its last part. Shyam was married to Hemangini Devi who hailed from a small village named Nasrathpur in Mardah block of Ghazipur district, near Benares and her father was a prosperous landlord. Shyam later worked as a lawyer in London, England, and there he married a second time while Devi raised Shankar in Benares and did not meet his son until he was eight years old.

Shankar shortened the Sanskrit version of his first name, Ravindra, to Ravi, for &quot;sun&quot;. Shankar had five siblings: Uday (who became a choreographer and dancer), Rajendra, Debendra and Bhupendra. Shankar attended the Bengalitola High School in Benares between 1927 and 1928.

At the age of 10, after spending his first decade in Benares, Shankar went to Paris with the dance group of his brother, choreographer Uday Shankar. By the age of 13 he had become a member of the group, accompanied its members on tour and learned to dance, and play various Indian instruments. Uday&#x27;s dance group travelled Europe and the United States in the early to mid-1930s and Shankar learned French, discovered Western classical music, jazz, cinema and became acquainted with Western customs. Shankar heard Allauddin Khan – the lead musician at the court of the princely state of Maihar – play at a music conference in December 1934 in Calcutta, and Uday persuaded the Maharaja of Maihar H.H. Maharaja Brijnath Singh Judev in 1935 to allow Khan to become his group&#x27;s soloist for a tour of Europe. Shankar was sporadically trained by Khan on tour, and Khan offered Shankar training to become a serious musician under the condition that he abandon touring and come to Maihar.

== Career ==

=== Training and work in India ===

Shankar&#x27;s parents had died by the time he returned from the Europe tour, and touring the West had become difficult because of political conflicts that would lead to World War II. Shankar gave up his dancing career in 1938 to go to Maihar and study Indian classical music as Khan&#x27;s pupil, living with his family in the traditional &quot;gurukul&quot; system. Khan was a rigorous teacher and Shankar had training on &quot;sitar&quot; and &quot;surbahar&quot;, learned &quot;ragas&quot; and the musical styles &quot;dhrupad&quot;, &quot;dhamar&quot;, and &quot;khyal&quot;, and was taught the techniques of the instruments &quot;rudra veena&quot;, &quot;rubab&quot;, and &quot;sursingar&quot;. He often studied with Khan&#x27;s children Ali Akbar Khan and Annapurna Devi. Shankar began to perform publicly on &quot;sitar&quot; in December 1939 and his debut performance was a &quot;jugalbandi&quot; (duet) with Ali Akbar Khan, who played the string instrument &quot;sarod&quot;.

Shankar completed his training in 1944. He moved to Mumbai and joined the Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association, for whom he composed music for ballets in 1945 and 1946, Dharti Ke Lal, 1946. Shankar recomposed the music for the popular song &quot;Sare Jahan Se Achcha&quot; at the age of 25. He began to record music for His Master&#x27;s Voice and worked as a music director for All India Radio (AIR), New Delhi, from February 1949 until January 1956. Shankar founded the Indian National Orchestra at AIR and composed for it; in his compositions he combined Western and classical Indian instrumentation. Beginning in the mid-1950s he composed the music for the &quot;Apu Trilogy&quot; by Satyajit Ray, which became internationally acclaimed. He was music director for several Hindi movies including &quot;Godaan&quot; and &quot;Anuradha&quot;.

=== 1956–1969: International performances ===

V. K. Narayana Menon, director of AIR Delhi, introduced the Western violinist Yehudi Menuhin to Shankar during Menuhin&#x27;s first visit to India in 1952. Shankar had performed as part of a cultural delegation in the Soviet Union in 1954 and Menuhin invited Shankar in 1955 to perform in New York City for a demonstration of Indian classical music, sponsored by the Ford Foundation.

Shankar heard about the positive response Khan received and resigned from AIR in 1956 to tour the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States. He played for smaller audiences and educated them about Indian music, incorporating &quot;ragas&quot; from the South Indian Carnatic music in his performances, and recorded his first LP album &quot;Three Ragas&quot; in London, released in 1956. In 1958, Shankar participated in the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the United Nations and UNESCO music festival in Paris. From 1961, he toured Europe, the United States, and Australia, and became the first Indian to compose music for non-Indian films. Shankar founded the Kinnara School of Music in Mumbai in 1962.

Shankar befriended Richard Bock, founder of World Pacific Records, on his first American tour and recorded most of his albums in the 1950s and 1960s for Bock&#x27;s label. The Byrds recorded at the same studio and heard Shankar&#x27;s music, which led them to incorporate some of its elements in theirs, introducing the genre to their friend George Harrison of the Beatles. In 1967, Shankar performed a well-received set at the Monterey Pop Festival. While complimentary of the talents of several of the rock artists at the festival, he said he was &quot;horrified&quot; to see Jimi Hendrix set fire to his guitar on stage: &quot;That was too much for me. In our culture, we have such respect for musical instruments, they are like part of God.&quot; Shankar&#x27;s peaked at number 43 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop LPs chart in the US, which remains the highest placing he achieved on that chart.

Shankar won a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance for &quot;West Meets East&quot;, a collaboration with Yehudi Menuhin. He opened a Western branch of the Kinnara School of Music in Los Angeles, in May 1967, and published an autobiography, &quot;My Music, My Life&quot;, in 1968. In 1968, he composed the score for the film &quot;Charly&quot;.

He performed at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, and found he disliked the venue. In the late 1960s, Shankar distanced himself from the hippie movement and drug culture. He explained during an interview:

=== 1970–2012: International performances ===
In October 1970, Shankar became chair of the Department of Indian Music of the California Institute of the Arts after previously teaching at the City College of New York, the University of California, Los Angeles, and being guest lecturer at other colleges and universities, including the Ali Akbar College of Music. In late 1970, the London Symphony Orchestra invited Shankar to compose a concerto with &quot;sitar&quot;. &quot;Concerto for Sitar &amp; Orchestra&quot; was performed with André Previn as conductor and Shankar playing the &quot;sitar&quot;. Shankar performed at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, held at Madison Square Garden in New York. After the musicians had tuned up on stage for over a minute, the crowd of rock-music fans broke into applause, to which the amused Shankar responded, &quot;If you like our tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more.&quot; which confused the audience. Still, the audience well received the subsequent performance. Although interest in Indian music had decreased in the early 1970s, the live album from the concert became one of the best-selling recordings to feature the genre and won Shankar a second Grammy Award.
In November and December 1974, Shankar co-headlined a North American tour with George Harrison. The demanding schedule weakened his health, and he suffered a heart attack in Chicago, causing him to miss a portion of the tour. Harrison, Shankar and members of the touring band visited the White House on invitation of John Gardner Ford, son of US president Gerald Ford. Shankar toured and taught for the remainder of the 1970s and the 1980s and released his second concerto, &quot;Raga Mala&quot;, conducted by Zubin Mehta, in 1981. Shankar was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Music Score for his work on the 1982 movie &quot;Gandhi&quot;.

He performed in Moscow in 1988, with 140 musicians, including the Russian Folk Ensemble and members of the Moscow Philharmonic, along with his own group of Indian musicians.

He served as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Parliament of India, from 12 May 1986 to 11 May 1992, after being nominated by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Shankar composed the dance drama &quot;Ghanashyam&quot; in 1989. His liberal views on musical co-operation led him to contemporary composer Philip Glass, with whom he released an album, &quot;Passages&quot;, in 1990, in a project initiated by Peter Baumann of the band Tangerine Dream.
Because of the positive response to Shankar&#x27;s 1996 career compilation &quot;In Celebration&quot;, Shankar wrote a second autobiography, &quot;Raga Mala&quot;. He performed between 25 and 40 concerts every year during the late 1990s. Shankar taught his daughter Anoushka Shankar to play &quot;sitar&quot; and in 1997 became a Regents&#x27; Professor at University of California, San Diego.

He performed with Anoushka for the BBC in 1997 at the Symphony Hall in Birmingham, England. In the 2000s, he won a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album for &quot;Full Circle: Carnegie Hall 2000&quot; and toured with Anoushka, who released a book about her father, &quot;Bapi: Love of My Life&quot;, in 2002. After George Harrison&#x27;s death in 2001, Shankar performed at the Concert for George, a celebration of Harrison&#x27;s music staged at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2002.

In June 2008, Shankar played what was billed as his last European concert, but his 2011 tour included dates in the United Kingdom.

On 1 July 2010, at the Southbank Centre&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, London, England, Anoushka Shankar, on sitar, performed with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by David Murphy, which was billed the first &quot;Symphony&quot; by Ravi Shankar.
=== Collaboration with George Harrison ===
The Beatles&#x27; guitarist George Harrison, who was first introduced to Shankar&#x27;s music by the American singers Roger McGuinn and David Crosby, themselves big fans of Shankar, became influenced by Shankar&#x27;s music. Harrison went on to help popularize Shankar and the use of Indian instruments in pop music throughout the 1960s. Olivia Harrison explains:
Harrison became interested in Indian classical music, bought a sitar and used it to record the song &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;. In 1968, he went to India to take lessons from Shankar, some of which were captured on film. This led to Indian music being used by other musicians and popularised the raga rock trend. As the sitar and Indian music grew in popularity, groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Animals and the Byrds began using it in some of their songs. The influence even extended to blues musicians such as Michael Bloomfield, who created a raga-influenced improvisation number, &quot;East-West&quot; (Bloomfield scholars have cited its working title as &quot;The Raga&quot; when Bloomfield and his collaborator Nick Gravenites began to develop the idea) for the Butterfield Blues Band in 1966.

Harrison met Shankar in London in June 1966 and visited India later that year for six weeks to study &quot;sitar&quot; under Shankar in Srinagar. During the visit, a documentary film about Shankar named &quot;Raga&quot; was shot by Howard Worth and released in 1971. Shankar&#x27;s association with Harrison greatly increased Shankar&#x27;s popularity, and decades later Ken Hunt of AllMusic wrote that Shankar had become &quot;the most famous Indian musician on the planet&quot; by 1966.

George Harrison organized the charity Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, in which Shankar participated. During the 1970s, Shankar and Harrison worked together again, recording &quot;Shankar Family &amp; Friends&quot; in 1973 and touring North America the following year to a mixed response after Shankar had toured Europe with the Harrison-sponsored Music Festival from India. Shankar wrote a second autobiography, &quot;Raga Mala&quot;, with Harrison as editor.

== Style and contributions ==

Shankar developed a style distinct from that of his contemporaries and incorporated influences from rhythm practices of Carnatic music. His performances begin with solo &quot;alap&quot;, &quot;jor&quot;, and &quot;jhala&quot; (introduction and performances with pulse and rapid pulse) influenced by the slow and serious &quot;dhrupad&quot; genre, followed by a section with &quot;tabla&quot; accompaniment featuring compositions associated with the prevalent &quot;khyal&quot; style. Shankar often closed his performances with a piece inspired by the light-classical &quot;thumri&quot; genre.

Shankar has been considered one of the top &quot;sitar&quot; players of the second half of the 20th century. He popularised performing on the bass octave of the &quot;sitar&quot; for the &quot;alap&quot; section and became known for a distinctive playing style in the middle and high registers that used quick and short deviations of the playing string and his sound creation through stops and strikes on the main playing string. Narayana Menon of &quot;The New Grove Dictionary&quot; noted Shankar&#x27;s fondness for rhythmic novelties, among them the use of unconventional rhythmic cycles. Hans Neuhoff of &quot;Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart&quot; has argued that Shankar&#x27;s playing style was not widely adopted and that he was surpassed by other &quot;sitar&quot; players in the performance of melodic passages. Shankar&#x27;s interplay with Alla Rakha improved appreciation for &quot;tabla&quot; playing in Hindustani classical music. Shankar promoted the &quot;jugalbandi&quot; duet concert style. Shankar introduced at least 31 new ragas, including &quot;Nat Bhairav&quot;, &quot;Ahir Lalit&quot;, &quot;Rasiya&quot;, &quot;Yaman Manjh&quot;, &quot;Gunji Kanhara&quot;, &quot;Janasanmodini&quot;, &quot;Tilak Shyam&quot;, &quot;Bairagi&quot;, &quot;Mohan Kauns&quot;, &quot;Manamanjari&quot;, &quot;Mishra Gara&quot;, &quot;Pancham Se Gara&quot;, &quot;Purvi Kalyan&quot;, &quot;Kameshwari&quot;, &quot;Gangeshwari&quot;, &quot;Rangeshwari&quot;, &quot;Parameshwari&quot;, &quot;Palas Kafi&quot;, &quot;Jogeshwari&quot;, &quot;Charu Kauns&quot;, &quot;Kaushik Todi&quot;, &quot;Bairagi Todi&quot;, &quot;Bhawani Bhairav&quot;, &quot;Sanjh Kalyan&quot;, &quot;Shailangi&quot;, &quot;Suranjani&quot;, &quot;Rajya Kalyan&quot;, &quot;Banjara&quot;, &quot;Piloo Banjara&quot;, &quot;Suvarna&quot;, &quot;Doga Kalyan&quot;, &quot;Nanda Dhwani&quot;, and &quot;Natacharuka (for Anoushka)&quot;. In 2011, at a concert recorded and released in 2012 as &quot;Tenth Decade in Concert: Ravi Shankar Live in Escondido&quot;, Shankar introduced a new percussive sitar technique called &quot;Goonga Sitar&quot;, whereby the strings are muffled with a cloth.

== Personal life and family ==
In 1941, Shankar married Annapurna Devi (Roshanara Khan), daughter of musician Allauddin Khan. Their son, Shubhendra &quot;Shubho&quot; Shankar, was born in 1942. He separated from Devi in 1962 and continued a relationship with dancer Kamala Shastri, a relationship that had begun in the late 1940s.

An affair with Sue Jones, a New York concert producer, led to the birth of Norah Jones in 1979. He separated from Shastri in 1981 and lived with Jones until 1986.

He began an affair in 1978 with married tanpura player Sukanya Rajan, whom he had known since 1972, which led to the birth of their daughter Anoushka Shankar in 1981. In 1989, he married Sukanya Rajan at Chilkur Temple in Hyderabad.

Shankar&#x27;s son, Shubhendra, often accompanied him on tours. He could play the &quot;sitar&quot; and &quot;surbahar&quot;, but elected not to pursue a solo career. Shubhendra died of pneumonia in 1992.

Ananda Shankar, the experimental fusion musician, is his nephew.

His daughter Norah Jones became a successful musician in the 2000s, winning eight Grammy Awards in 2003 and overall nine Grammy Awards as of 2024.

His daughter Anoushka Shankar was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album in 2003. Anoushka and her father were both nominated for Best World Music Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards for separate albums.

Shankar was a Hindu, and a devotee of the Hindu god Hanuman. He was also an &quot;ardent devotee&quot; of the Bengali Hindu saint, Sri Anandamayi Ma. Shankar used to visit Anandamayi Ma frequently and performed for her on various occasions. Shankar wrote of his hometown, Benares (Varanasi), and his initial encounter with &quot;Ma&quot;:
Varanasi is the eternal abode of Lord Shiva, and one of my favorite temples is that of Lord Hanuman, the monkey god. The city is also where one of the miracles that have happened in my life took place: I met Ma Anandamayi, a great spiritual soul. Seeing the beauty of her face and mind, I became her ardent devotee. Sitting at home now in Encinitas, in Southern California, at the age of 88, surrounded by the beautiful greens, multi-colored flowers, blue sky, clean air, and the Pacific Ocean, I often reminisce about all the wonderful places I have seen in the world. I cherish the memories of Paris, New York, and a few other places. But Varanasi seems to be etched in my heart!
Shankar was a vegetarian. He wore a large diamond ring that he said was manifested by Sathya Sai Baba. He lived with Sukanya in Encinitas, California.

Shankar performed his final concert with daughter Anoushka on 4 November 2012 at the Terrace Theater in Long Beach, California.

== Illness and death ==
On 9 December 2012, Shankar was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, San Diego, California after complaining of breathing difficulties. He died on 11 December 2012 at around 16:30 PST after undergoing heart valve replacement surgery.

The &quot;Swara Samrat festival&quot;, organized on 5–6 January 2013 and dedicated to Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan, included performances by such musicians as Shivkumar Sharma, Birju Maharaj, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Zakir Hussain, and Girija Devi.

<text>Jamadagni () is a sage in Hindu literature. He is regarded in Hindu tradition to be one of the Saptarishi (Seven Vedic sages) in the 7th, and the current age of Manvantara.

He is a descendant of the sage Bhrigu, one of the Prajapatis created by Brahma, the creator deity. Jamadagni has five children with his wife, Renuka, the youngest of whom is Parashurama, an avatar of Vishnu.

==Legend ==

=== Birth ===
According to the Bhagavata Purana, the sage Richika was asked by King Gadhi to bring a thousand white horses with black ears to marry Satyavati. Richika, with the help of Varuna, brought those horses and the king allowed Richika to marry Satyavati.

After their wedding, Satyavati, and her mother, demanded from Richika the blessings for having a son. Accordingly, the sage prepared two portions of milk boiled rice for each, one with the Brahma mantra (for Satyavati) and other with the Kṣātra mantra (for his mother-in-law). Giving the respective portions, he went to perform his ablutions. Meanwhile, Satyavati&#x27;s mother asked her daughter to swap their portions. Her daughter obeyed. When Richika learned of this exchange, he said that the child born of his mother-in-law would be a great Brahmana, but that his son would become an aggressive warrior, who would bring a bloodbath to this world. Satyavati prayed to amend this outcome, so that her son would be born as the great Brahmana, but that her grandson would become the aggressive warrior. This resulted in Jamadagni being born as a sage (out of Satyavati&#x27;s womb) and eventually, Parashurama being born as Jamadagni&#x27;s son, a warrior with a fearful reputation.

Thus, Jamadagni was born to Richika and Satyavati. Meanwhile, around the same time as Jamadagni&#x27;s birth, Gadhi&#x27;s wife Paurakuthsu (Satyavati&#x27;s mother) gave birth to a son with Kshatriya traits, named Kaushika. He later becomes the renowned Vishvamitra, who was a Kshatriya by birth, but later ascended to the status of a Brahmarishi.

=== Householder ===
Growing up, Jamadagni studied hard and achieved erudition in his studies of the Vedas. He is said to have acquired knowledge regarding the science of weapons without any formal instruction, with the guidance of his father. The &quot;Aushanasa Dhanurveda,&quot; now lost, is about a conversation between Jamadagni and Ushanas on the exercises of warfare.

After achieving the status of a rishi, Jamadagni visited a number of holy sites, and finally reached the palace of King Prasenajit of the Solar dynasty. He fell in love with his daughter, Princess Renuka, upon seeing her, and asked the king for her hand in marriage. Subsequently, the two were married, and had five sons: Ṛumaṇvān, Suhotra, Vasu, Viśvāvasu, and Rama, later known as Parshurama. The couple started to engage in tapasya along the banks of the river Narmada.

He receives Sharanga, the celestial bow of Vishnu, from his father, Richika.

=== Death of Renuka ===
According to the Brahmanda Purana, Renuka once went to the banks of the river Narmada to fetch some water. There, she observed the king of the Salva kingdom playing with his queen in the water. She stood there, mesmerised by the beauty of the sight. By the time she reached the hermitage of her husband with the water, she was quite late. The weary Jamadagni was furious when he heard the reason for her delay, and called forth each of his sons, one after the other, to kill her. Each of them refused to kill their own mother. Parashurama, however, came forth, and beheaded his mother with a single arrow. The rishi exiled his four older sons to the forests due to their disobedience. Pleased by Parashurama&#x27;s devotion to him, he granted his son any boon of his choice. Parashurama wished for his mother to be restored to life, and this was granted.

=== Dharma&#x27;s test ===
In the Ashvamedha Parva of the Mahabharata, Dharma took the form of Anger, and manifested at the ashrama of Jamadagni. He observed that the rishi had just milked his cow, Kamadhenu, and kept her milk in a pot. As Anger, Dharma crept into the pot. Despite drinking it, Jamadagni remained calm. Noticing this, Dharma appeared as a Brahmin before the rishi, and blessed him with the boon that he would always be righteous in the future.

=== Boons from Surya ===

According to the Mahabharata, Jamadagni once became annoyed with the sun god, Surya, for causing too much heat. The warrior-sage shot several arrows into the sky, terrifying Surya. Surya then appeared before the rishi as a Brahmin, and gave him two inventions that would help mankind deal with his heat - sandals and an umbrella.

=== Death ===
Jamadagni was once visited by the Haihaya king Kartavirya Arjuna and his retinue (who was said to have thousand arms/hands), to whom he served a feast offered by the divine cow, Kamadhenu. The king sent his minister called Chandragupta, who offered a ten million cows, or even half the kingdom, to purchase this cow of plenty, but Jamadagni refused to part with her. Not willing to concede, Chandragupta and his men seized the cow by force and took her away with them. The helpless rishi, who loved the cow, pursued Chandragupta&#x27;s party as they traversed the forest, unwilling to allow them to steal her. Infuriated by his defiance, the minister struck down Jamadagni, and took Kamadhenu to the king&#x27;s capital city of Māhiṣmatī.

After a long wait, Renuka started to search for her husband, finding him almost dead, surrounded by a pool of his own blood. Renuka fainted at the sight, and when she returned to consciousness, started wailing. When Parashurama and his disciple, Akṛtavraṇa, found her, she turned to him, and beat her breast twenty-one times. Parashurama resolved that he would travel the world twenty-one times, and annihilate all the Kshatriya kings he could find. When Jamadagni was to be cremated, the sage Shukra arrived on the scene, and restored the rishi&#x27;s life with the &quot;Mṛtasañjīvanī&quot; mantra.

Parashurama and Akṛtavraṇa travelled to Māhiṣmatī, intending to bring Kamadhenu back home. At the gates of the city, they met Kartavirya Arjuna and his forces in battle, and slew them. They returned the divine cow to Jamadagni. The rishi instructed his son to perform a penance at Mahendragiri in order to cleanse himself of his sins. While Parashurama had left for this penance, Shurasena, a son of Kartavirya Arjuna, and his men, exacted their vengeance by beheading Jamadagni at his hermitage, and taking his head with them so that he could not be resurrected again. Parashurama and Jamadagni&#x27;s disciples cremated the rishi, and his wife Renuka performed sati. Thence, Parashurama, inheriting his fallen father&#x27;s Sharanga, started his twenty-one expeditions to obliterate the kings of the Kshatriya race.

In the Buddhist Vinaya Pitaka section of the &quot;Mahavagga&quot; (I.245) the Buddha pays respect to Jamadagni by declaring that the Vedas (Shruti&#x27;s) in their true form were revealed to the original Vedic rishis, including Jamadagni.

<text>Kartavirya Arjuna (, ; also known as Sahasrabahu Arjuna or Sahasrarjuna) was a king of an ancient Haihayas kingdom with capital at Mahishmati which is on the banks of Narmada River in the current state of Madhya Pradesh. Kartavirya was son of Kritavirya, king of the Haihayas. According to the Puranas, Haihaya was the grandson of Sahasrajit, son of Yadu(king) of Yadavas}. This is his patronymic, by which he is best known; he is also referred to simply as Arjuna. He is described as having a thousand hands and a great devotee of god Dattatreya. 

One of the several such accounts states that Arjuna conquered Mahishmati city from Karkotaka Naga, a Naga chief and made it his fortress-capital.

Almost 100 manuscripts on the worship of Kārtavīrya have been found mostly in the royal libraries of the Hindu Rajas. The states in which the manuscripts are still available are: Udaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Bikaner, Bharatpur, and Alwar of Rajasthan, and further in Mysore.

==Origin==

Kartavirya Arjuna was the son of Kritavirya and the prince of the Haihaya kingdom descended from Yadu. He once performed a penance lasting for 10,000 years which culminated into four boons from Sage Dattatreya. The boons vary according to different sources but they are namely:

1. A thousand mighty and dextrous arms that could appear or disappear at will.

2. Conquest of the world.

3. Devotion to Dharma.

4. Invincibility with respect to all enemies except the one destined to slay him.

With these boons, Kartavirya conquered the city of Mahishmati which was then ruled by a Naga named Karkotaka. After conquering the world, he performed 10,000 splendid Yagnas and it was said that no king was his equal in virtue and prowess. He could cause rains with his Yogic powers or check the sea waves with his thousand arms. According to the Vayu Purana, he ruled for 85,000 years and had at least a 100 sons. His empire was free of any kind of misfortune and subjects were devoted to their duties.

==Encounter with Ravana==

Kartavirya&#x27;s power is popularly told in the Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, which is not often considered to be the part of the original Valmiki Ramayana and its constituent 6 adhyayas (अध्याय), since the original Ramayana speaks of the number of verses and the shlokas in Ramayana – Verse 2 of Chapter IV of Baala Kaanda of Srimad Valmiki Ramayana reads as:

चतुर्विंशत्सहस्त्राणि श्लोकानामुक्तवानृषिः |

तथा सर्गशतान् पञ्च षट्काण्डानि तथोत्तरम् ||

This epic contains 24,000 verses split into 500 chapters in Six Cantos. (Baala Kaanda: refer Ch IV:2) [The six cantos are Baala Kaanda, Ayodhya Kaanda, Aranya Kaanda, Kishkinda Kaanda, Sundara (Lanka) Kaanda and Yuddha Kaanda.].

Kartavirya is considered to be the contemporary of Ravana. The story goes that once when Kartavirya Arjuna was having a bath in the river Narmada along with his wives, he stopped the force of the river with his thousand arms from both sides. The teenage Dasagriva (Ravana), who was singing the hymns of Shiva and praying to him, made him lose his concentration. Enraged, he challenged the former for combat in which Ravana was defeated and was put to humiliation. Then, on request of his paternal grandfather Pulastya the great emperor Kartavirya Arjuna released Ravana.

Another account states that when Ravana came &quot;in the course of his campaign of conquest to Kunnamkulam (the capital of Kartavirya), he was captured without difficulty, and was confined like a wild beast in a corner of his city.&quot;

The Vayu Purana states that Kartavirya invaded Lanka, and there took Ravana as prisoner, but later he was killed by Parashurama and Ravana was rescued from Arjuna.

==Encounter with Parashurama==
According to the Mahabharata and the Puranas, the most celebrated Haihaya king was Kartavirya Arjuna. His epithet was &quot;Sahasrabahu&quot;. He was called a &quot;Samrat&quot; and &quot;Chakravartin&quot;. His name is found in the Rig Veda (VIII.45.26). He ultimately conquered Mahishmati city from Karkotaka Naga, a Naga chief and made it his fortress-capital. According to the Vayu Purana, he invaded Lanka and took Ravana prisoner. Arjuna propitiated Dattatreya and was favoured by him. Arjuna&#x27;s sons killed sage Jamadagni. Jamadagni&#x27;s son Parashurama in revenge killed Arjuna. Arjuna had a number of sons. His son Jayadhvaja succeeded him to the throne. Jayadhvaja was succeeded by his son Talajangha.

As per the Narada Purana (76:4), The Thousand Armed Sahasrabahu Arjuna was the incarnation of the Thousand Blade Sudarsana Chakra. He was born on the Earth in order to face the power of Vishnu in the contest with the Shaktyavesha Avatar Parashurama. In most accounts, Kartavirya is described as a righteous king, who eventually became egotistical. The kshatriyas of his age, on account of their war with the Bhargava clan over property, became unrighteous and began oppressing and slaying innocent Brahmins, etc. On this count, the Jivatma Parashurama (destined to be a future Saptarishi) was born with the God Vishnu&#x27;s divine strength and power to rid the Earth of unjust rulers. Kartavirya was slated to be his prime opponent, as the mightiest king of that time.

In the Mahabharata Vana Parva, according to the story of Akritavana, Kartavirya Arjuna became drunk with power, despite all the boons he had acquired. He lost control of his senses and began to oppress humans, Yakshas and the very gods themselves. Kartavirya even had the audacity to insult Indra in front of Shachi. Around this time, other Kshatriyas too had become drunk with power and oppressed innocents for pleasure.

Arjuna once troubled Varuna and asked him if there was anyone equal to him in power. Varuna replied that only Jamadagni&#x27;s son, Parashurama rivalled Arjuna. Enraged, Arjuna went to Jamadagni&#x27;s hermitage to see Parashurama&#x27;s power.

The Puranas recount that Kartavirya Arjuna and his army visited a rishi named Jamadagni, who fed his guest and the whole army with offerings from his divine cow Kamadhenu. The king demanded the cow for the betterment of his subjects; Jamadagni refused because he needed the cow for his religious ceremonies. King Arjuna sent his soldiers to take the cow. As the conflict developed among the Jamadagni and the King, Arjuna lost his temper and chopped off the head of Jamadagni. When Parashurama (Jamadagni&#x27;s son and &quot;one of the Daśāvatāras&quot; of Vishnu) returned to the hermitage, he was informed of the context by his mother. In revenge, Parashurama killed the entire clan of Arjuna and the King with a battleaxe given to him by Shiva, eventually killing all kshatriyas, thus conquering the entire earth. He enacted this wholesale eradication of the kshatriyas for 21 generations.

In another legend, Kartavirya Arjuna visited the hermitage of Jamadagni, and was received by that sage&#x27;s wife Renuka with all respect; but he made an ill return for her hospitality, and carried off by violence &quot;the calf of the milch-cow of the sacred oblation.&quot; For this outrage Parashurama cut off his thousand arms and killed him.

In another legend, Kartavirya sent seventeen Akshauhinis to fight against the alone Parashurama who was on foot. Parshurama single-handedly slew the entire army and spared no one alive. Kartavirya arrived in his divine golden chariot which could go anywhere unobstructed. The King himself was a powerful archer, capable of simultaneously wielding five hundred bows and shooting five hundred arrows at a time. Parashurama broke Arjuna&#x27;s bows, slew his horses and charioteer and destroyed the chariot itself with his arrows.

Arjuna hurled many weapons, rocks and trees at Parashurama, but the sage parried all these. Parashurama hacked off his thousand arms with his arrows and dismembered him with his axe.

In another place a different character is given to him, and more in accordance with his behavior at Jamadagni&#x27;s hut. &quot;He oppressed both men and gods,&quot; so that the latter appealed to Vishnu for succor. That God then came down to the earth as Parashurama for the special purpose of killing him.

The Mahabharata mentions him as one of the best warriors and introduces his divine origin, attributing it to the Padmini Ekadasi. It is said that there was none who could rival him in Sacrifices, Charity, Learning, Austerity, Battlefield Exploits, Feats, Strength, Mercy, Generosity or Power.

In the controversy regarding his name the clarification is given as below; Sahasra is the correct prefix that means &quot;a thousand&quot;, not SahasTra. However, it is invariably misspelled as the latter. The same prefix is spelled when referring to the crown chakra: &quot;Sahasrara Chakra&quot; or when it occurs in family names (example: Sahasrabuddhe) &quot;without&quot; a T. Also see Sahasralinga. The confusion arises because the Hindi letter &quot;Sa&quot; (स) merges with &quot;ra&quot; (र) and looks like &quot;stra&quot; (स्र).

==The origin of Vrishala Kshatriya==
The Ocean said, If thou hast heard, O king, of the great Rishi Jamadagni, his son is competent to duly receive thee as a guest.--Then that king proceeded, filled with great wrath. Arrived at that retreat, he found Rama himself. With his kinsmen he began to do many acts that were hostile to Rama, and caused much trouble to that high-souled hero. Then the energy, which was immeasurable of Rama blazed forth, burning the troops of the foe, O lotus-eyed one. Taking up his battle-axe, Rama suddenly put forth his power, and hacked that thousand-armed hero, like a tree of many branches. Beholding him slain and prostrated on the earth, all his kinsmen, uniting together, and taking up their darts, rushed at Rama, who was then seated, from all sides. Rama also, taking up his bow and quickly ascending on his car, shot showers of arrows and chastised the army of the king. Then, some of the Kshatriyas, afflicted with the terror of Jamadagni&#x27;s son, entered mountain-fastnesses, like deer afflicted by the lion. Of them that were unable, through fear of Rama, to discharge the duties ordained for their order, the progeny became Vrishalas owing to their inability to find Brahmanas. In this way Dravidas and Abhiras and Pundras, together with the Savaras, became Vrishalas through those men who had Kshatriya duties assigned to them (in consequence of their birth), falling away (from those duties). Then the Kshatriyas that were begotten by.

Later on, as Patanjali&#x27;s Aṣṭādhyāyī mentions, Abhiras appear in 150 BC. Later on, Abhiras established the Traikutaka dynasty with kings such as Ishwarsena, Indradutta, Dahrasena &amp; Vyaghrasena. Dahrasena even performed Ashwamedha Yagya. Traikutikas were known for their Vaishnava faith, who claimed to be Yadava of Haiheya branch. Later on, in 10th century, Chudasamas are mentioned as the &quot;Abhira Ranaka&quot;, in Hemachandra&#x27;s reference to Graharipu in &quot;Dvyashraya&quot;. Merutunga claims in his prose that Abhira Ranaka, Navaghana defeated Jayasimha eleven times, but Jayasimha went himself twelfth time after capturing newly fortified Vardhamanapura (now Wadhwan).

==Outside Indian subcontinent==
===Indonesia===

In Indonesia version, especially in Javanese wayang, Kartavirya Arjuna (Indonesian: &quot;Kartawirya Arjuna&quot; ) is called by the name of Prabu Arjuna Sasrabahu. He is told as the son of Kartawirya and still a descendant of Batara Surya. His grandfather, Herriya, was the founder of the Mahespati Kingdom. Herriya has a sister named Resi Wisageni who has two sons named Suwandagni and Jamadagni. Suwandagni had sons named Sumantri and Sukasrana, while Jamadagni had sons named Ramabargawa (Parasurama). Thus, between Arjuna and Parasurama there is still a cousin relationship.

The Javanese version of Arjuna Sasrabahu is considered an avatar of Lord Vishnu. He ruled justly and wisely in the Mahespati Kingdom. His wife named Citrawati daughter of the Kingdom of Magadha. The person who was assigned to propose to the daughter was Sumantri. This success had made Sumantri forget herself. He also challenges Arjuna if he wants to take Citrawati as a wife, he must take it himself. After going through an exciting battle, Sumantri finally admitted defeat. Arjuna was willing to forgive as long as Sumantri could move Sriwedari Park from Mount Untarayana into Mahespati&#x27;s palace. Sumantri managed to fulfill this request thanks to the help of her younger brother, Sukasrana. Arjuna who was very happy decided to appoint Sumantri as governor with the title Suwanda.

One day Arjuna went on an excursion with his wife in a river. He did triwikrama changing his form into a very large giant and while lying on the dam the flow of the river created a pond as a bathing place for Citrawati. As a result, the river overflowed to flood the camp of Ravana king of Alengka who was on his way to expand the colony. Then there was a battle between the Alengka troops against Mahespati. Because Citrawati is the reincarnation of Widawati, the woman Ravana loves, Hwana is increasingly eager to crush Mahespati&#x27;s army. After Suwanda died in the battle, Arjuna Sasrabahu woke up from his sleep and immediately attacked Ravana. Arjuna managed to defeat Ravana, then tied him with chains and dragged him using a chariot. Seeing the torture, Batara Narada came down to deliver a message from heaven for Arjuna to release Ravana because the giant king was not destined to die. Arjuna also freed Ravana on the condition that he should stop spit out his anger. Ravana agreed, and from that moment he became a vassal of Arjuna Sasrabahu. With various tricks Ravana tried to eliminate Arjuna to launch his greedy act again and marry Citrawati.

One day when Arjuna was hunting alone in the forest to entertain himself, Ravana came to report to Citrawati that her husband had died in an accident. Despite Ravana&#x27;s plan, Citrawati actually defended her starch by plunging into the fire. Upon hearing of his wife&#x27;s death, Arjuna became even more sad. In this situation Batara Vishnu left Arjuna&#x27;s body to return to heaven. Arjuna who had lost his passion for life, went to abandon his kingdom. On the way he met Ramabargawa alias Parasurama, his cousin. The valiant Brahmin wandered in search of the perfect death. Apparently he had received divine instructions that he could enter heaven if he died at the hands of Vishnu&#x27;s incarnation through a fight.

Seeing a good opportunity, Ramabargawa also challenged Arjuna Sasrabahu. Arjuna who was no longer passionate about life was finally killed by Ramabargawa&#x27;s ax. Batara Narada descended from heaven to explain to Ramabargawa that Vishnu had long since left Arjuna&#x27;s body. Later, Vishnu will reappear as a prince from the Ayodhya Kingdom named Sri Rama. This character will later lead Ramabargawa to his death.

<text>Bobby Darin (born Walden Robert Cassotto; May 14, 1936 – December 20, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He performed jazz, pop, rock and roll, folk, swing, and country music.

Darin started his career as a songwriter for Connie Francis. In 1958, Darin co-wrote and recorded his first million-selling single, &quot;Splish Splash&quot;, which was followed by Darin&#x27;s own song &quot;Dream Lover&quot;, then his covers of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, which brought him worldwide fame. In 1962, Darin won a Golden Globe Award for his first film, &quot;Come September&quot;, co-starring his first wife, actress Sandra Dee. In 1959, Darin become inaugural winner of the Best New Artist category and also won Record of the Year for &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; at 2nd Annual Grammy Awards.

During the 1960s, Darin became more politically active and worked on Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s Democratic presidential campaign. He was present at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the time of Robert Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in June 1968. That same year, Darin discovered the woman who had raised him was his grandmother, not his mother as he thought, and learned that the woman he thought was his sister was actually his mother. Those events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion.

Although Darin made a successful comeback (in television) in the early 1970s, his health was beginning to fail due to a weak heart. The knowledge of Darin&#x27;s vulnerability had always spurred him on to use his musical talent while still young. Darin died in 1973 at the age of 37 in a hospital recovery room after having open heart surgery in Los Angeles.

==Early life==
Darin was born Walden Robert Cassotto in East Harlem, New York City, on May 14, 1936, to Vanina Juliette &quot;Nina&quot; Cassotto (born November 30, 1917). Because his mother was only 18 at the time of his birth, Darin was raised to believe his maternal grandmother was his mother and Nina was his older sister.

Darin&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Vivian &quot;Polly&quot; Fern Walden, (born in 1891) was of English, Danish and Norwegian ancestry and had been a vaudeville singer before Darin&#x27;s birth. His maternal grandfather, Saverio Antonio &quot;Big Sam Curly&quot; Cassotto (born January 26, 1882), was of Italian descent. He had been a made man and &quot;soldier&quot; in the Genovese Crime Family as well as a close associate of Frank Costello. Sam served as a witness at Costello&#x27;s 1914 wedding, though the relationship soured after he accused Costello of withholding money that was meant for Cassotto&#x27;s family. Sam Cassotto died from pneumonia in 1935 while in prison, a year before Darin&#x27;s birth.

In 1968, when Darin was 32 and considering entering politics, Nina told him the truth, reportedly devastating Darin. She refused to reveal the identity of his biological father and took that secret to her grave when she died in 1983. The man&#x27;s identity remained unknown until 2020. In April 2020, Emilio &quot;Milton&quot; Lepore (1911/1912 – 1965) was traced, through familial DNA, as being Darin&#x27;s biological father. 

Darin moved to the Bronx early in his life (with a rented summer home in Staten Island) and graduated from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science. In later years, Darin attributed his arrogance to his experiences there, where Darin was surrounded by brighter students who teased him. Darin then enrolled at Hunter College and soon gravitated to the drama department. After only two semesters, he dropped out to pursue an acting career. Darin was an ambitious young adult and aspired to be an actor, go on Broadway, and become a recording artist.

By the time he was a teenager, Darin could play several instruments, including piano, drums, and guitar. He later added harmonica and xylophone. Darin took his stage name, &quot;Bobby Darin&quot;, when he began to record. One version of how Darin got the name is that the first three letters on a Mandarin Chinese restaurant were burned out. According to another version, he adapted it from the first name of actor Darren McGavin, TV&#x27;s Mike Hammer. Darin said: &quot;My legal name will remain Cassotto. Cassotto was my mother&#x27;s name, and it will be my children&#x27;s name.&quot;

==Music career==

=== 1950s ===
Darin&#x27;s career took off with a songwriting partnership, formed in 1955 with Don Kirshner, whom he met at a candy store in Washington Heights. They wrote jingles and songs, beginning with &quot;Bubblegum Pop&quot;. In 1956, Darin&#x27;s agent negotiated a contract with Decca Records. The songs recorded at Decca had minimal commercial success.

A member of the Brill Building gang of struggling songwriters, Darin was introduced to singer Connie Francis, for whom he helped write several songs. They developed a romantic interest, but her father was not fond of Darin and did not approve of the relationship, and the couple split up. At one point, Darin wanted to elope immediately; Francis has said that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.

Darin left Decca to sign with Atlantic Records&#x27; Atco subsidiary, where he wrote and arranged music for himself and others. Songs Darin recorded, such as Harry Warren&#x27;s &quot;I Found a Million Dollar Baby&quot;, were sung in an Elvis style, which did not suit Darin&#x27;s personality.

Guided by Atlantic&#x27;s star-maker Ahmet Ertegun, Darin&#x27;s career finally took off in 1958 when he recorded &quot;Splish Splash&quot;. Darin co-wrote the song with radio D.J. Murray Kaufman after a phone call from Kaufman&#x27;s mother, Jean, a frustrated songwriter. Her latest song idea was: &quot;Splish, Splash, Take a Bath&quot;. Both Kaufman and Darin felt the title was lackluster, but Darin, with few options, said: &quot;I could write a song with that title.&quot; Within an hour, Darin had written &quot;Splish Splash&quot;. The single, Darin&#x27;s first successful foray into the rock and roll genre, sold more than a million copies. His partnership with Kirshner, who was not involved in the writing of that song, ended at that time. Darin made another recording in 1958 for Brunswick Records with a band called The Ding Dongs. With the success of &quot;Splish Splash&quot; the single was re-released by Atco Records as &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; with the band renamed as The Rinky Dinks. It charted, and made it to number 24 in the United States.

In 1959, Darin recorded the self-penned &quot;Dream Lover&quot;, a ballad that became a multi-million seller. With it came financial success and the ability to demand more creative control of his career; Darin meant for his &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot; album to show that he could sing more than rock and roll as a result. Darin&#x27;s next single, &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, the standard from Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot;, was given a vamping jazz-pop interpretation. Although Darin was initially opposed to releasing it as a single, the song went to No. 1 on the chart for nine weeks, sold two million copies, and won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1960. He was also voted the Grammy Award for Best New Artist that year, and &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; has since been honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award.

Darin followed &quot;Mack&quot; with &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, a jazzy English-language version of Charles Trenet&#x27;s French hit song &quot;La Mer&quot;. Both tracks were produced by Atlantic founders Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun with staff producer Jerry Wexler and they featured arrangements by Richard Wess.

The late-1950s success included Darin setting the all-time attendance record at the Copacabana nightclub in Manhattan and headlining at the major casinos in Las Vegas.

=== 1960s ===
Darin&#x27;s 1960 recording of &quot;Artificial Flowers&quot;, a song by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock from the Broadway musical &quot;Tenderloin&quot; about the death of a child laborer, featured a jazzy, big band arrangement by Richard Behrke, that was in sharp contrast to its tragic lyrics.

In the 1960s, Darin owned and operated, with Doris Day&#x27;s son Terry Melcher, a music publishing and production company (TM Music/Trio). Darin signed Wayne Newton and gave him the song &quot;Danke Schoen&quot;, which became Newton&#x27;s breakout hit. Darin also was a mentor to Roger McGuinn, who worked for him at TM Music and played the 12-string guitar in Darin&#x27;s nightclub band before forming the Byrds. Darin also produced Rosey Grier&#x27;s 1964 LP &quot;Soul City&quot;, and &quot;Made in the Shade&quot; for Jimmy Boyd.

In 1962, Darin began to write and sing country music, with hit songs including &quot;Things&quot; (US No. 3/UK No. 2) (1962), &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason I&#x27;m Living&quot; (US No. 3), and &quot;18 Yellow Roses&quot; (US No. 10). The latter two were recorded by Capitol Records, which he joined in 1962, before returning to Atlantic three years later. Darin left Capitol in 1964. Two years later, he had his final UK hit single, with a version of Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;If I Were A Carpenter&quot;, which peaked at No. 9 (No. 8 in the US). Darin performed the opening and closing songs on the soundtrack of the 1965 Walt Disney film &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot;. &quot;Things&quot; was sung by Dean Martin in the 1967 TV special &quot;Movin&#x27; With Nancy&quot;, starring Nancy Sinatra.

==Acting career==

In the fall of 1959, Darin played &quot;Honeyboy Jones&quot; in an early episode of Jackie Cooper&#x27;s CBS military sitcom/drama &quot;Hennesey&quot;. That same year, he became the only actor ever to have been signed to five major Hollywood film studios. Darin wrote music for several films in which he appeared.

Darin&#x27;s first major film, &quot;Come September&quot; (1961), was a teenager-oriented romantic comedy with Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida and featuring 18-year-old actress Sandra Dee. They met during the production of the film and they soon married on December 1, 1960. Dee gave birth to a son, Dodd Mitchell Darin (also known as Morgan Mitchell) on December 16, 1961. Dee and Darin made a few films together with moderate success, such as &quot;If a Man Answers&quot; (1962), and &quot;That Funny Feeling&quot; (1965).

In 1961, Darin starred as a struggling jazz musician in &quot;Too Late Blues&quot;, John Cassavetes&#x27; first film for a major Hollywood studio. Writing in 2012, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Dennis Lim observed that Darin was &quot;a surprise in his first nonsinging role, willing to appear both arrogant and weak&quot;. In 1962, Darin won the Golden Globe Award for &quot;New Star of the Year – Actor&quot; for his role in &quot;Come September&quot;. The following year he was nominated for a Best Actor Golden Globe for &quot;Pressure Point&quot;. 

In 1963, Darin was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as a shell-shocked soldier in &quot;Captain Newman, M.D.&quot; Throughout his acting career, Darin appeared alongside a series of Hollywood leading men Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, and Gregory Peck. 

In October 1964, Darin appeared as a wounded ex-convict who is befriended by an orphan girl in &quot;The John Gillman Story&quot; episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot; western television series.

==Later years==

=== Politics ===

Darin became more politically active as the 1960s progressed, and his musical output became more &quot;folksy&quot;. In 1966, Darin had a hit with folksinger Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;, securing a return to the Top 10 after a two-year absence.

Darin traveled with Robert F. Kennedy and worked on the politician&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign. He was with Kennedy on June 4, 1968, the day he traveled to Los Angeles for the California primary, and Darin was also at the Ambassador Hotel later that night when Kennedy was assassinated. That event, combined with learning about his true parentage, had a deep effect on Darin, who spent most of the next year living in seclusion in a trailer near Big Sur. In 1968–69, he wrote and recorded two albums that covered issues such as civil rights, poverty, the Vietnam War and the death of RFK – &quot;Bobby Darin Born Walden Robert Cassotto&quot; (1968) and &quot;Commitment&quot; (1969).

=== Direction Records ===
Returning to Los Angeles in 1969, Darin started his own record label which was titled Direction Records, putting out folk and protest music. Darin wrote &quot;Simple Song of Freedom&quot; in 1969, which, in an interesting turn of events, was first recorded by Tim Hardin and the song became Hardin&#x27;s best-selling record. It reached #48 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top 100 Singles list in Canada. Also in Canada, a version by &quot;Buckwheat&quot; reached #52. Darin himself sang the song &quot;live&quot; on several television variety shows.

Of his first Direction album, Darin told the press, &quot;The purpose of Direction Records is to seek out statement-makers...The album is solely compositions designed to reflect my thoughts on the turbulent aspects of modern society.&quot;Darin was struggling with his finances as his music career was dwindling. Darin&#x27;s venture into protest music was not received favorably and generated little or no profits. In late 1969, Darin sold his songs, his record label (Direction Records), and publishing company (TM Music), losing the copyright to his own music and eventually, their worth. The company Darin sold them to went bankrupt. It was believed that during his final days, Darin was still trying to gain back the rights to his music.

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, Darin proposed a self-directed and written film &quot;The Vendors&quot; (1970), about the life of a folk singer. However, the production left him broke and was not released, which led Darin to return to music. In spite of his declining health, Darin&#x27;s last venture was spent performing live, while undergoing heart surgery and receiving post-treatment medication. He released his last album, self-titled (1972) on Motown.

=== NBC Variety shows ===
Beginning on July 27, 1972, Darin starred in his own television variety show on NBC, &quot;Dean Martin Presents: The Bobby Darin Amusement Company&quot;, which ran for seven episodes ending on September 7. Beginning on January 19, 1973, Darin starred in a similar show on NBC called &quot;The Bobby Darin Show&quot;. That show ran for 13 episodes, ending on April 27. Darin subsequently made television guest appearances and remained a top draw.

== Style and influence ==
Darin was on par with Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. In 1960, Darin infamously told &quot;Life&quot; magazine that he wanted to be established as a legend by the age of 25. Darin&#x27;s off-the-cuff statements generated a rivalry and playful banter between Sinatra and himself. Sinatra released a cover version of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; on the 1984 album &quot;L.A. Is My Lady&quot;, perhaps a testament to Darin.

Darin and Elvis Presley were notable friends and teen idols in the 1950s. On occasion, Presley would sneak into Darin&#x27;s concerts and watch him perform.

In his short life, Darin explored all genres of music, such as pop, jazz, country, and folk music. In a 1988 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Neil Young confessed: &quot;I used to be pissed off at Bobby Darin because he changed styles so much. Now I look at him and I think he was a fucking genius.&quot;

==Other interests==
Darin was an enthusiastic chess player. His television show included an occasional segment where he would explain a chess move. Darin arranged with the United States Chess Federation to sponsor a grandmaster tournament, which pitted him against the young Eastern Division champion Stephen Ryder, with the largest prize fund in history, but the event was canceled after Darin&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==

=== Relationship with Connie Francis ===
In 1956, Darin and Connie Francis met after their manager, George Scheck, arranged for Francis to record a song Darin had written. They were soon in what Darin&#x27;s friends described as, &quot;an intense romance&quot;. However, Francis&#x27;s parents did not approve of Darin and one night after returning from a date, Francis found her bags packed and waiting for her on the front step. Darin proposed almost immediately. When her father found out about the engagement, he stormed into the rehearsals of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; with a gun and threatened to shoot Darin, who managed to escape out of a window. Darin and Francis talked briefly after the show, but parted ways. Over a four-month period in 1956, the two maintained a secret correspondence involving love letters. Darin kept the letters until his death, and the letters were auctioned. They were returned to Francis later in life.

In the following years, they saw each other several times while appearing on the same television shows but were never romantically involved again. In 1960, Francis heard on the radio that Darin had married Sandra Dee — just as she and her father were driving through the Lincoln Tunnel. Francis later wrote: &quot;I wished that somehow God would cause the Hudson River to come gushing in and entrap us in that tunnel.&quot; Francis has said that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.

=== Marriages ===
Darin married actress Sandra Dee on December 1, 1960. They met in Rome, Italy, while filming &quot;Come September&quot; (which was released in 1961). It was Dee&#x27;s mother, Mary Douvon, who convinced the actress to go on a date with Darin. Later commenting on their relationship, Dee stated: &quot;Bobby loved me. He was a calculating guy, but I don&#x27;t think he arrived in Rome with a plan to marry this new little Mary Pickford of Hollywood. Aside from the fact that he was rude, brash and always trying to get a reaction, I didn&#x27;t like this person. I just thought, this is a conniving SOB.&quot; On December 16, 1961, they had a son named Dodd Mitchell Darin. In the early 1960s, the pair became Hollywood&#x27;s golden couple, but they had a troublesome marriage, and divorced on March 7, 1967.

Darin&#x27;s second wife was Andrea Yeager, a legal secretary, whom he met in 1970. They married on June 25, 1973, after living together for three years. Four months later, in October 1973, the couple divorced amid strain caused by Darin&#x27;s worsening health problems.

==Health==
Darin had poor health throughout his life. Darin was frail as an infant and, beginning at age eight, had recurring bouts of rheumatic fever that left him with a seriously weakened heart. Darin was well aware that he might not live long, and lived his life accordingly.

During his first heart surgery in January 1971, Darin had two artificial valves implanted, then spent most of that year recovering from the surgery. In the last few years of his life, Darin was often administered oxygen during and after his performances on stage and screen.

==Death==
In 1973, after failing to take antibiotics to protect his heart before a dental visit, Darin developed sepsis, an overwhelming systemic infection, which further weakened his body and affected one of his heart valves. On December 11 of that year, Darin checked himself into Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles for another round of open-heart surgery to repair the two artificial heart valves he had received in January 1971. On the evening of December 19, a four-person surgical team worked for over six hours to repair Darin&#x27;s damaged heart. Shortly after the surgery ended in the early morning hours of December 20, Darin died in the recovery room without regaining consciousness. He was 37 years old.

Darin&#x27;s last wish in his will was that his body be donated to science for medical research, and Darin&#x27;s remains were transferred to the UCLA Medical Center shortly after his death.

==Legacy==
In 1990, Darin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with singer and close friend Paul Anka announcing the honor. In 1999, Darin was voted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Songwriter Alan O&#x27;Day alluded to Darin and his recording of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; in the song &quot;Rock and Roll Heaven&quot; (made a hit by the Righteous Brothers), a tribute to deceased musicians, which O&#x27;Day wrote shortly after Darin&#x27;s death.

On May 14, 2007, Darin was awarded a star on the Las Vegas Walk of Stars to honor his contribution to making Las Vegas the &quot;Entertainment Capital of the World&quot; and named him one of the twentieth century&#x27;s greatest entertainers. Fans paid for the star. Darin also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

On December 13, 2009, at its 2010 Grammy Awards ceremony, the Recording Academy awarded Darin a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award.

===Biopic===

In 1986, director Barry Levinson intended to direct a film based on Darin&#x27;s life and had begun preproduction on the project by early 1997. He abandoned the project, the rights to which were subsequently bought by actor Kevin Spacey, along with Darin&#x27;s son, Dodd. The resultant biopic, &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, starred Spacey as Darin, with the actor using his own singing voice for the musical numbers. The film covers much of Darin&#x27;s life and career, including his marriage to Sandra Dee, portrayed by Kate Bosworth.

&quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; opened at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Although Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee, and Blauner responded enthusiastically to Spacey&#x27;s work and the film was strongly promoted by the studio, &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; received mixed-to-poor reviews upon wide release, and box office results were disappointing. Spacey, however, was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor—Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, but the award that year went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of Darin&#x27;s musical contemporary Ray Charles.

===Musical===
In September 2016, &quot;Dream Lover: The Bobby Darin Musical&quot; had its world premiere at Sydney Lyric Theatre, Australia. The production featured the story of Darin with an 18-piece big band. Darin was played by David Campbell. Darin had an unusual upbringing, being raised by a &quot;mother&quot; who was actually his grandmother and alongside a &quot;sister&quot; who was actually his mother, a fact Darin did not discover until he was 31 years old. Campbell grew up in a similar circumstance, leading Bobby&#x27;s son Dodd Darin to describe Campbell as perfect for the role, stating, &quot;You have to have lived something like that to understand it and [Campbell] has, and I think he can relate to my dad, he can relate to the pain.&quot; Campbell made similar observations, describing playing Darin as a &quot;cathartic experience&quot;, and stating, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m healing things during this show.&quot; The production was nominated in six categories in the 18th Helpmann Awards, including for Best Musical, with Campbell receiving the Helpmann Award for Best Male Actor in a Musical. in 2024, Jonathan Groff was announced to play Darin in upcoming musical &quot;Just in Time&quot;.

<text>MI8, or &quot;Military Intelligence, Section 8&quot; was a British Military Intelligence group responsible for signals intelligence and was created in 1914. It originally consisted of four sections: MI8(a), which dealt with wireless policy; MI8(b), based at the General Post Office, dealt with commercial and trade cables; MI8(c) dealt with the distribution of intelligence derived from censorship; and MI8(d), which liaised with the cable companies. During World War I MI8 officers were posted to the cable terminals at Poldhu Point and Mullion in Cornwall and Clifden in County Galway, continued until 1917 when the work was taken over by the Admiralty. In WW2, MI8 was responsible for the extensive War Office Y Group and briefly, for the Radio Security Service.

==History==

MI8 was the signals intelligence department of the War Office that ran a worldwide Y-stations network. Additionally, for an 18-month period, from late 1939 to mid 1941, it also ran the Radio Security Service, under the designation of MI8c, but this was quickly handed over to MI6. The remainder of this page relates only to this small organisation, with, regrettably, no information concerning the major role of MI8.

===MI8c===
The Radio Security Service evolved from the Illicit Wireless Intercept Organisation (IWIO), which was given the designation MI1g and run by Lt Col. J S Yule. From an office in Broadway, IWIO collaborated with Military Intelligence, Section 5 (MI5) and with the General Post Office (GPO) to set up and control a small network of Direction Finding (DF) and intercept stations, to locate illicit transmissions inside Britain. Col Yule also made detailed plans for similar networks in British overseas territories, before IWIO evolved into RSS in September 1939.

But Lt Col Adrian Simpson developed a proposal which stated that a small number of stations, located around Britain, would not work.

At the start of World War II, Vernon Kell, the head of MI5, introduced a contingency plan to deal with the problem of illicit radio transmissions. A new body was created, the Radio Security Service (RSS), headed by Major J.P.G. Worlledge. Until 1927, Worlledge had commanded a Wireless Company in Palestine. His brief was to &quot;intercept, locate and close down illicit wireless stations operated either by enemy agents in Great Britain or by other persons not being licensed to do so under Defence Regulations, 1939&quot;. As a security precaution, RSS was given the cover designation of MI8(c).

Working from cells at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, Worlledge selected Majors Sclater and Cole-Adams as his assistants, and E.W.B. Gill as his chief traffic analyst. Gill had been engaged in wireless interception in World War I and decided that the best course of action would be to find the transmissions of the agent control stations in Germany. He recruited a research fellow from Oxford, Hugh Trevor-Roper, who was fluent in German. Working alongside them, at Wormwood Scrubs, was John Masterman, who ran MI5&#x27;s double agent XX program. Masterman already had Agent SNOW, and Gill used his codes as the basis for decrypting incoming agent traffic.

RSS assigned the task of developing a comprehensive listening organization to Ralph Mansfield, 4th Baron Sandhurst. Sandhurst was an enthusiastic amateur radio operator. He had served with the Royal Engineers Signal Service during World War I and had been commissioned as a major in the Royal Corps of Signals in 1939.

Sandhurst was given an office in the Security Service&#x27;s temporary accommodation in Wormwood Scrubs&#x27;s prison. He began by approaching the President of the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB), Arthur Watts. Watts had served as an analyst in Room 40 during World War I, following the loss of a leg at Gallipoli. Watts recommended that Sandhurst recruit the entire RSGB Council. He did. The RSGB Council then began to recruit the society&#x27;s members as Voluntary Interceptors (VIs). Radio amateurs were considered ideal for such work because they were widely distributed across the United Kingdom.

The VIs were mostly working men of non-military age, working in their own time and using their own equipment (their transmitters had been impounded on the outbreak of war, but their receivers had not). They were ordered to ignore commercial and military traffic, to concentrate on more elusive transmissions. Each VI was given a minimum number of intercepts to make each month. Reaching that number gave them exemption from other duties, such as fire watching. Also, many VIs were issued a special DR12 identity card. This allowed them to enter premises which they suspected to be the transmission source of unauthorized signals.

RSS also established a series of Radio Direction Finding stations, in the far corners of the British Isles, to identify the locations of the intercepted transmissions.

The recruitment of Voluntary Interceptors (VIs) was slow, since they had to be skilled, discreet, and dedicated. But, within three months, 50 VIs were at work and had identified over 600 transmitters - all firmly on the other side of the English Channel. It became apparent that there were no enemy agents transmitting from the UK. All German agents entering the UK were promptly captured and either interned or &quot;turned&quot; to operate as double agents under the supervision of the &quot;XX Committee&quot;. In some cases, a British operator took over their transmissions, impersonating them. The German military did not realize this.

By May 1940, it was clear that RSS&#x27;s initial mission - to locate enemy agents in the UK - was complete.

===Arkley View===

Initially, messages logged by VIs were sent to Wormwood Scrubs. However, as the volume became great and as Wormwood began to suffer from German air attacks, RSS was in need of larger premises and chose Arkley View, a large country house near the village of Arkley, in Hertfordshire, which had already been requisitioned as an intercept station. It was given the cryptic postal address of Box 25, Barnet. There, a staff of analysts and cryptographers began their duties.

===MI6 takeover===
RSS had in effect become the civilian counterpart of the military&#x27;s &quot;Y Service&quot; intercept network. By mid-1941, up to 10,000 logs (message sheets) a day were being sent to Arkley, then forwarded to the code-breaking centre at Bletchley Park.

In May 1941, RSS&#x27;s success and the fact that some of its personnel had managed to decode some Abwehr cyphers ahead of Bletchley, caused control of the organization to be transferred. There was brief conflict over who would control it. In the end, it became the communication and interception service of Military Intelligence, Section 6 (MI6). Previously, MI6 had possessed no such capability.

The new controller of RSS was Lieutenant-Colonel E.F. Maltby. From 1942, Lt. Col. Kenneth Morton Evans was appointed Deputy Controller. Roland Keen, author of &quot;Wireless Direction Finding&quot;, was the officer in charge of engineering. The service was well-financed. It was equipped with a new central radio station at Hanslope Park in Buckinghamshire (designated Special Communications Unit No.3 or SCU3). The Abwehr was now monitored around the clock. The volume and regularity of the obtained material, enabled Bletchley to achieve one of its great triumphs in December 1941, when it decoded the Abwehr&#x27;s Enigma cypher, giving enormous insight into German intelligence operations.

At its peak in 1943-1944, RSS employed - apart from VIs - more than 1,500 personnel, most of whom had been amateur radio operators. Over half of these worked as interceptors while a further number investigated the numerous enemy radio networks. This revealed important information, even when it was not possible to decode messages. Few transmissions by secret agents of German Intelligence evaded RSS&#x27; notice. Changes in procedure, which the Germans used for security, were in many cases identified before the enemy had become familiar with them.

Following the end of the war, RSS HQ moved to Eastcote and was absorbed by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).

<text>Parvati (, , IPA: /pɑɾʋət̪iː/), also known as Uma (, , IPA: /ʊmɑː/) and Gauri (, , IPA: /gə͡ʊɾiː/), is one of the principal goddesses in Hinduism, revered as the goddess of power, energy, nourishment, harmony, love, beauty, devotion, and motherhood. Along with Lakshmi and Sarasvati, she forms the trinity, known as the Tridevi.

From her first appearance as a goddess during the epic period (400 BCE – 400 CE), Parvati is primarily depicted as the consort of the god Shiva. According to the Puranas, Parvati is the reincarnation of Sati, Shiva&#x27;s first wife, who relinquished her body to sever familial ties with her father, Daksha after he had insulted Shiva. Parvati is often equated with the other goddesses such as Sati, Uma, Kali and Durga and due to this close connection, they are often treated as one and the same, with their stories frequently overlapping. In Hindu mythology, the birth of Parvati is primarily understood as a cosmic event meant to lure Shiva out of his ascetic withdrawal and into the realm of marriage and household life. As Shiva&#x27;s wife, Parvati represents the life-affirming, creative force that complements Shiva&#x27;s austere, world-denying nature. Her presence in his life draws him from isolation into worldly engagement, thus balancing the two poles of asceticism and householder life in Hindu philosophy. Parvati&#x27;s role as wife and mother is central to her mythological persona, where she embodies the ideal of the devoted spouse who both supports and expands her husband&#x27;s realm of influence. Parvati is also noted for her motherhood, being the mother of the prominent Hindu deities Ganesha and Kartikeya.

Philosophically, Parvati is regarded as Shiva’s &quot;shakti&quot; (divine energy or power), the personification of the creative force that sustains the cosmos. In this role, she becomes not only a mother and nurturer but also the embodiment of cosmic energy and fertility. She is the source of power that energises Shiva, who without her is incomplete. Parvati&#x27;s mythology, therefore, is not just about her role as a wife but also about her cosmic function as the force that activates and sustains life. In various Shaiva traditions, Parvati is also regarded as a model devotee, and even viewed as the embodiment of Shiva&#x27;s grace, playing a central role in the spiritual liberation of devotees. She is also one of the central deities in the goddess-oriented sect of Shaktism, where she is regarded as a benevolent aspect of Mahadevi, the supreme deity, and is closely associated with various manifestations of Mahadevi, including the ten Mahavidyas and the Navadurgas. Parvati is found extensively in ancient &quot;Puranic&quot; literature, and her statues and iconography are present in Hindu temples all over South Asia and Southeast Asia. In Hindu temples dedicated to her and Shiva, she is symbolically represented as the &quot;yoni&quot;.

==Etymology and nomenclature ==

&quot;Parvata&quot; () is one of the Sanskrit words for &quot;mountain&quot;; &quot;Parvati&quot; derives her name from being incarnated as the daughter of king Himavan (also called Himavata, &quot;Parvata&quot;) and mother &quot;Menavati&quot;. King Parvata is considered lord of the mountains and the personification of the Himalayas; Parvati implies &quot;she of the mountain&quot;. Aparneshara Temple of Yama, Udhampur in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is considered as the birthplace of Parvati and site of &quot;Shiva-Parvati Vivaha.&quot;

Parvati is known by many names in Hindu literature. Other names which associate her with mountains are &quot;Shailaja&quot; (Daughter of the mountains), &quot;Shailaputri&quot; (Daughter of Mountains), &quot;Haimavati&quot; (Daughter of Himavan), &quot;Maheshvari (Maheshvara’s wife)&quot;, &quot;Girirajaputri&quot; (Daughter of king of the mountains) and &quot;Girija (Daughter of the mountains).&quot;

Shaktas consider the Parvati as an incarnation of Lalita Tripurasundari. Two of Parvati&#x27;s most famous epithets are Uma and Aparna. The name Uma is used for Sati (Shiva&#x27;s wife, who is the incarnation of Parvati) in earlier texts, but in the Ramayana, it is used as a synonym for Parvati. In the Harivamsa, Parvati is referred to as Aparna (&#x27;One who took no sustenance&#x27;) and then addressed as Uma, who was dissuaded by her mother from severe austerity by saying &quot;u mā&quot; (&#x27;oh, don&#x27;t&#x27;). Uma also means that &quot;the One born out of &quot;Om&quot; (&quot;The Pranava Mantra)&quot; She is also referred to as &quot;Ambika&quot; (&#x27;dear mother&#x27;), &quot;Shakti&quot; (&#x27;power&#x27;), &quot;Mataji&quot; (&#x27;revered mother&#x27;), &quot;Maheshwari&quot; (&#x27;great goddess&#x27;), &quot;Durga&quot; (invincible), &quot;Bhairavi&quot; (&#x27;ferocious&#x27;), &quot;Bhavani&quot; (&#x27;fertility and birthing&#x27;), &quot;Shivaradni&quot; (&#x27;Queen of Shiva&#x27;), &quot;Urvi&quot; or &quot;Renu&quot;, and many hundreds of others. Parvati is also the goddess of love and devotion, or Kamakshi (the goddess of fertility), abundance and food/nourishment, or Annapurna. She is also the ferocious Mahakali that wields a sword, wears a garland of severed heads, and protects her devotees and destroys all evil that plagues the world and its beings.

The apparent contradiction that Parvati is addressed as the golden one, Gauri, as well as the dark one, Kali or Shyama, as a calm and placid wife Parvati mentioned as Gauri and as a goddess who destroys evil she is Kali. Regional stories of Gauri suggest an alternate origin for Gauri&#x27;s name and complexion. In parts of India, Gauri&#x27;s skin color is golden or yellow in honor of her being the goddess of ripened corn/harvest and fertility.

The divine hymns such as Lalita Sahasranama and Mahalakshmi Ashtakam give many

epithets to the goddess based on the demons she had won over such as &quot;Mahishasuramardini&quot; (‘the One who killed demon Mahishasura’), &quot;Raktabeejasamharini&quot; (‘the One who killed demon Raktabeeja’), &quot;Chamundi&quot; (‘the One who killed the demon brothers Chanda and Munda’), &quot;Mookambika&quot; (‘the killer of Mookasura’), &quot;Kolasurabhayankari&quot; (‘the killer of Kolasura’), &quot;Bhandasuravibedhini&quot; (‘the killer of Bhandasura) and many more.

==History ==
The word Parvati does not explicitly appear in Vedic literature. Instead, Ambika, Rudrani and others are found in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. The verse 3.12 of the &quot;Kena Upanishad&quot; dated to mid-1st millennium BCE contains a goddess called Uma-Haimavati, a very common alternate name for Parvati. Sayana&#x27;s commentary in &quot;Anuvaka&quot;, however, identifies Parvati in the &quot;Kena Upanishad&quot;, suggesting her to be the same as Uma and Ambika in the Upanishad, referring to Parvati is thus an embodiment of divine knowledge and the mother of the world. She appears as the &quot;shakti&quot;, or essential power, of the Supreme Brahman. Her primary role is as a mediator who reveals the knowledge of Brahman to the Vedic Trideva of Agni, Vayu, and Varuna, who were boasting about their recent defeat of a group of demons. But Kinsley notes: &quot;it is little more than conjecture to identify her with the later goddess Satī-Pārvatī, although [..] later texts that extol Śiva and Pārvatī retell the episode in such a way to leave no doubt that it was Śiva&#x27;s spouse..&quot; [IAST original].

Sati-Parvati appears in the epic period (400 BCE–400 CE), as both the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; present Parvati as Shiva&#x27;s wife. However, it is not until the plays of Kalidasa (5th–6th centuries) and the Puranas (4th through the 13th centuries) that the stories of Sati-Parvati and Shiva acquire more comprehensive details. Kinsley adds that Parvati may have emerged from legends of non-aryan goddesses that lived in mountains. While the word Uma appears in earlier Upanisads, Hopkins notes that the earliest known explicit use of the name Pārvatī occurs in late &quot;Hamsa Upanishad&quot;.

Weber suggests that just like Shiva is a combination of various Vedic gods Rudra and Agni, Parvati in Puranas text is a combination of wives of Rudra. In other words, the symbolism, legends, and characteristics of Parvati evolved fusing Uma, Haimavati, Ambika in one aspect and the more ferocious, destructive Kali, Gauri, Nirriti in another aspect. Tate suggests Parvati is a mixture of the Vedic goddesses Aditi and Nirriti, and being a mountain goddess herself, was associated with other mountain goddesses like Durga and Kali in later traditions.

==Iconography and symbolism==

Parvati, the gentle aspect of Devi Shakti, is usually represented as fair, beautiful, and benevolent. She typically wears a red dress (often a sari), and may have a head-band. When depicted alongside Shiva she generally appears with two arms, but when alone she may be depicted having four. These hands may hold a trident, mirror, rosary, bell, dish, goad, sugarcane stalk, or flowers (such as a lotus). One of her arms in front may be in the Abhaya mudra (hand gesture for &#x27;fear not&#x27;), one of her children, typically Ganesha, is on her knee, while her younger son Skanda may be playing near her in her watch. In ancient temples, Parvati&#x27;s sculpture is often depicted near a calf or cow. Bronze has been the chief metal for her sculpture, while stone is the next most common material.

Parvati and Shiva are often symbolized by a yoni and a linga, respectively. In ancient literature, &quot;yoni&quot; means &quot;womb&quot; and &quot;place of gestation&quot;, the yoni-linga metaphor represents &quot;origin, source or regenerative power&quot;. The linga-yoni icon is widespread, found in Shaivite Hindu temples of South Asia and Southeast Asia. Often called &quot;Shivalinga&quot;, it almost always has both linga and the yoni. The icon represents the interdependence and union of feminine and masculine energies in recreation and regeneration of all life. In some depictions, Parvati and Shiva are shown in various forms of sexual union.

In some iconography, Parvati&#x27;s hands may symbolically express many mudras (symbolic hand gestures). For example, Kataka — representing fascination and enchantment, Hirana — representing the antelope, the symbolism for nature and the elusive, Tarjani by the left hand—representing the gesture of menace, and Chandrakal — representing the moon, a symbol of intelligence. Kataka is expressed by hands closer to the devotee; Tarjani mudra with the left hand, but far from the devotee.

If Parvati is depicted with two hands, Kataka mudra—also called Katyavalambita or Katisamsthita hasta—is common, as well as Abhaya (fearlessness, fear not) and Varada (beneficence) are representational in Parvati&#x27;s iconography. Parvati&#x27;s right hand in Abhaya mudra symbolizes &quot;do not fear anyone or anything&quot;, while her Varada mudra symbolizes &quot;wish-fulfilling&quot;. In Indian dance, &quot;Parvatimudra&quot; is dedicated to her, symbolizing divine mother. It is a joint hand gesture, and is one of sixteen &quot;Deva Hastas&quot;, denoting the most important deities described in &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot;. The hands mimic motherly gesture, and when included in a dance, the dancer symbolically expresses Parvati. Alternatively, if both hands of the dancer are in &quot;Ardhachandra&quot; mudra, it symbolizes an alternate aspect of Parvati.

Parvati is sometimes shown with golden or yellow color skin, particularly as goddess Gauri, symbolizing her as the goddess of ripened harvests.

In some manifestations, particularly as angry, ferocious aspects of Shakti such as Kali, she has eight or ten arms, and is astride on a tiger or lion, wearing a garland of severed heads and skirt of disembodied hands. In benevolent manifestations such as Kamakshi or Meenakshi, a parrot sits near her right shoulder symbolizing cheerful love talk, seeds, and fertility. A parrot is found with Parvati&#x27;s form as Kamakshi – the goddess of love, as well as &quot;Kama&quot; – the cupid god of desire who shoots arrows to trigger infatuation. A crescent moon is sometimes included near the head of Parvati particularly the Kamakshi icons, for her being half of Shiva. In South Indian legends, her association with the parrot began when she won a bet with her husband and asked for his loincloth as victory payment; Shiva keeps his word but first transforms her into a parrot. She flies off and takes refuge in the mountain ranges of south India, appearing as Meenakshi (also spelled Minakshi).

Parvati is expressed in many roles, moods, epithets, and aspects. In Hindu mythology, she is an active agent of the universe, the power of Shiva. She is expressed in nurturing and benevolent aspects, as well as destructive and ferocious aspects. She is the voice of encouragement, reason, freedom, and strength, as well as of resistance, power, action and retributive justice. This paradox symbolizes her willingness to realign to &quot;Pratima&quot; (reality) and adapts to the needs of circumstances in her role as the universal mother. As Mahakali, she identifies and destroys evil for protection, and as Annapurna, she creates food and abundance for nourishment.

==Manifestations==

Several Hindu stories present alternate aspects of Parvati, such as the ferocious, violent aspect as Shakti and related forms. Shakti is pure energy, untamed, unchecked, and chaotic. Her wrath crystallizes into a dark, blood-thirsty, tangled-hair Goddess with an open mouth and a drooping tongue. This goddess is usually identified as the terrible &quot;Mahakali&quot; (time). In Linga Purana, Parvati undergoes a metamorphosis into Kali, at the request of Shiva, to destroy an asura (demon) Daruk. Even after destroying the demon, Kali&#x27;s wrath could not be controlled. To lower Kali&#x27;s rage, Shiva appeared as a crying baby. The cries of the baby arouse the maternal instinct of Kali who reverts to her benign form as Parvati. Lord Shiva, in this baby form is Kshethra Balaka (who becomes Rudra Savarni Manu in future).

In Skanda Purana, Parvati assumes the form of a warrior-goddess and defeats a demon called &quot;Durg&quot; who assumes the form of a buffalo. In this aspect, she is known by the name Durga. Although Parvati is considered another aspect of Shakti, just like Kali, Durga, Kamakshi, Meenakshi, Gauri and many others in modern-day Hinduism, many of these &quot;forms&quot; or aspects originated from regional legends and traditions, and the distinctions from Parvati are pertinent.

According to Shaktism and Shaivism traditions, and also in Devi Bhagavata Purana, Parvati is the lineal progenitor of all other goddesses. She is worshiped as one with many forms and names. Her form or incarnation depends on her mood.

* Akhilandeshwari, found in coastal regions of India, is the goddess associated with water.
* Uma devi/Tripura Parvati, a goddess who looks like Bhuvaneshvari. She assumed to destroy ego of Devas. Her Dhyana Shloka is mentioned in 13th chapter of Devi Mahatmya.
* Shiva himself, Shiva and Parvati are sometimes thought of as being identical and the same as a higher &quot;God&quot; who is both male and female.

==Legends==

The Puranas tell the tale of Sati&#x27;s marriage to Shiva against her father Daksha&#x27;s wishes. The conflict between Daksha and Shiva gets to a point where Daksha does not invite Shiva to his yagna (fire-sacrifice). Daksha insults Shiva when Sati comes on her own. She immolates herself at the ceremony. This shocks Shiva, who is so grief-stricken that he loses interest in worldly affairs, retires, and isolates himself in the mountains, in meditation and austerity. Sati is then reborn as Parvati, the daughter of Himavat and Mainavati, and is named Parvati, or &quot;she from the mountains&quot;, after her father Himavant who is also called king &quot;Parvat&quot;.

According to different versions of her chronicles, the maiden Parvati resolves to marry Shiva. Her parents learn of her desire, discourage her, but she pursues what she wants. Indra sends the god Kama – the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction, and affection, to awake Shiva from meditation. &quot;Kama&quot; reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire. Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns the cupid &quot;Kama&quot; to ashes. Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva. She begins to live in mountains like Shiva, engage in the same activities as Shiva, one of asceticism, yogin and tapas. This draws the attention of Shiva and awakens his interest. He meets her in disguised form, tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva&#x27;s weaknesses and personality problems. Parvati refuses to listen and insists on her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married. Shiva dedicates the following hymn in Parvati&#x27;s honor,
I am the sea and you the wave,&lt;br&gt;
You are Prakṛti, and I Purusha.&lt;br&gt;– Translated by Stella Kramrisch

After the marriage, Parvati moves to Mount Kailash, the residence of Shiva. To them are born Kartikeya (also known as Skanda and Murugan) – the leader of celestial armies, and Ganesha – the god of wisdom that prevents problems and removes obstacles.

There are many alternate Hindu legends about the birth of Parvati and how she married Shiva. In the Harivamsa, for example, Parvati has two younger sisters called Ekaparna and Ekapatala. According to Devi Bhagavata Purana and Shiva Purana mount Himalaya and his wife Mena appease goddess Adi Parashakti. Pleased, Adi Parashakti herself is born as their daughter Parvati. Each major story about Parvati&#x27;s birth and marriage to Shiva has regional variations, suggesting creative local adaptations. The stories go through many ups and downs until Parvati and Shiva are finally married.

Kalidasa&#x27;s epic &quot;Kumarasambhavam&quot; (&quot;Birth of Kumara&quot;) describes the story of the maiden Parvati who has made up her mind to marry Shiva and get him out of his recluse, intellectual, austere world of aloofness. Her devotions aimed at gaining the favor of Shiva, the subsequent annihilation of Kamadeva, the consequent fall of the universe into barren lifelessness, regeneration of life, the subsequent marriage of Parvati and Shiva, the birth of Kartikeya, and the eventual resurrection of Kamadeva after Parvati intercedes for him to Shiva.

Parvati&#x27;s legends are intrinsically related to Shiva. In the goddess-oriented Shakta texts, that she is said to transcend even Shiva, and is identified as the Supreme Being. Just as Shiva is at once the presiding deity of destruction and regeneration, the couple jointly symbolize at once both the power of renunciation and asceticism and the blessings of marital felicity.

Parvati thus symbolizes many different virtues esteemed by Hindu tradition: fertility, marital felicity, devotion to the spouse, asceticism, and power. Parvati represents the householder ideal in the perennial tension in Hinduism in the household ideal and the ascetic ideal, the latter represented by Shiva. Renunciation and asceticism is highly valued in Hinduism, as is the householder&#x27;s life – both feature as Ashramas of ethical and proper life. Shiva is portrayed in Hindu legends as the ideal ascetic withdrawn in his personal pursuit in the mountains with no interest in social life, while Parvati is portrayed as the ideal householder keen on nurturing worldly life and society. Numerous chapters, stories, and legends revolve around their mutual devotion as well as disagreements, their debates on Hindu philosophy as well as the proper life.

Parvati tames Shiva with her presence. When Shiva does his violent, destructive Tandava dance, Parvati is described as calming him or complementing his violence by slow, creative steps of her own Lasya dance. In many myths, Parvati is not as much his complement as his rival, tricking, seducing, or luring him away from his ascetic practices.
Three images are central to the mythology, iconography, and philosophy of Parvati: the image of Shiva-Shakti, the image of Shiva as Ardhanarishvara (the Lord who is half-woman), and the image of the linga and the yoni. These images that combine the masculine and feminine energies, Shiva and Parvati, yield a vision of reconciliation, interdependence, and harmony between the way of the ascetic and that of a householder.

The couple is often depicted in the Puranas as engaged in &quot;dalliance&quot; or seated on Mount Kailash debating concepts in Hindu theology. They are also depicted as quarreling. In stories of the birth of Kartikeya, the couple is described as love-making; generating the seed of Shiva. Parvati&#x27;s union with Shiva symbolizes the union of a male and female in &quot;ecstasy and sexual bliss&quot;. In art, Parvati is depicted seated on Shiva&#x27;s knee or standing beside him (together the couple is referred to as &quot;Uma-Maheshvara&quot; or &quot;Hara-Gauri&quot;) or as &quot;Annapurna&quot; (the goddess of grain) giving alms to Shiva.

Shaiva&#x27;s approaches tend to look upon Parvati as the Shiva&#x27;s submissive and obedient wife. However, Shaktas focus on Parvati&#x27;s equality or even superiority to her consort. The story of the birth of the ten Mahavidyas (Wisdom Goddesses) of Shakta Tantrism. This event occurs while Shiva is living with Parvati in her father&#x27;s house. Following an argument, he attempts to walk out on her. Her rage at Shiva&#x27;s attempt to walk out manifests in the form of ten terrifying goddesses who block Shiva&#x27;s every exit.

David Kinsley states,

===Ardhanarisvara===
Parvati is portrayed as the ideal wife, mother, and householder in Indian legends. In Indian art, this vision of the ideal couple is derived from Shiva and Parvati as being half of the other, represented as &quot;Ardhanarisvara&quot;. This concept is represented as an androgynous image that is half man and half woman, Siva and Parvati, respectively.

===Ideal wife, mother and more===
In Hindu Epic the Mahabharata, she as Umā suggests that the duties of wife and mother are as follows – being of a good disposition, endued with sweet speech, sweet conduct, and sweet features. Her husband is her friend, refuge, and god. She finds happiness in her husband&#x27;s and her children&#x27;s physical and emotional nourishment and development. Their happiness is her happiness. She is cheerful even when her husband or children are angry; she is with them in adversity or sickness. She takes an interest in worldly affairs beyond her husband and family. She is cheerful and humble before family, friends, and relatives; she helps them if she can. She welcomes guests, feeds them, and encourages a righteous social life. Parvati declares her family life and home are heaven in Book 13 of the Mahabharata.

Rita Gross states, that the view of Parvati only as ideal wife and mother is incomplete symbolism of the power of the feminine in the mythology of India. Parvati, along with other goddesses, is involved with a broad range of culturally valued goals and activities. Her connection with motherhood and female sexuality does not confine the feminine or exhaust their significance and activities in Hindu literature. She is balanced by Durga, who is strong and capable without compromising her femaleness. She manifests in every activity, from water to mountains, from arts to inspiring warriors, from agriculture to dance. Parvati&#x27;s numerous aspects state Gross, reflects the Hindu belief that the feminine has a universal range of activities, and her gender is not a limiting condition.

Parvati is seen as the mother of two widely worshipped deities Ganesha and Kartikeya.

===Ganesha===
Hindu literature, including the Matsya Purana, Shiva Purana, and Skanda Purana, dedicates many stories to Parvati and Shiva and their children. For example, one about Ganesha is:
: Once, while Parvati wanted to take a bath, there were no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally entering the house. Hence she created an image of a boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body and infused life into it, and thus Ganesha was born. Parvati ordered Ganesha not to allow anyone to enter the house, and Ganesha obediently followed his mother&#x27;s orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, Ganesha stopped him. Shiva was infuriated, lost his temper, and severed the boy&#x27;s head with his trident. When Parvati came out and saw her son&#x27;s lifeless body, she was very angry. She demanded that Shiva restore Ganesha&#x27;s life at once. Shiva did so by attaching an elephant&#x27;s head to Ganesha&#x27;s body, thus giving rise to the elephant-headed deity.

==In culture==
===Festivals===
Teej is a significant festival for Hindu women, particularly in the northern and western states of India. Parvati is the primary deity of the festival, and it ritually celebrates married life and family ties. It also celebrates the monsoon. The festival is marked with swings hung from trees, girls playing on these swings typically in a green dress (seasonal color of crop planting season), while singing regional songs. Historically, unmarried maidens prayed to Parvati for a good mate, while married women prayed for the well-being of their husbands and visited their relatives. In Nepal, Teej is a three-day festival marked with visits to Shiva-Parvati temples and offerings to linga. Teej is celebrated as Teeyan in Punjab.
The Gowri Habba, or Gauri Festival, is celebrated on the seventh, eighth, and ninth of Bhadrapada (Shukla paksha). Parvati is worshipped as the goddess of harvest and protector of women. Her festival, chiefly observed by women, is closely associated with the festival of her son Ganesha (Ganesh Chaturthi). The festival is popular in Maharashtra and Karnataka.

In Rajasthan, the worship of Gauri happens during the Gangaur festival. The festival starts on the first day of Chaitra the day after Holi and continues for 18 days. Images of Issar and Gauri are made from Clay for the festival.

Another popular festival in reverence of Parvati is Navratri, in which all her manifestations are worshiped over nine days. Popular in eastern India, particularly in Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Assam, as well as several other parts of India such as Gujarat, with her nine forms, that is, Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayini, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, and Siddhidatri.

Another festival &quot;Gauri Tritiya&quot; is celebrated from Chaitra Shukla third to Vaishakha Shukla third. This festival is popular in Maharashtra and Karnataka, less observed in North India, and unknown in Bengal. The unwidowed women of the household erect a series of platforms in a pyramidal shape with the image of the goddess at the top and a collection of ornaments, images of other Hindu deities, pictures, shells, etc. below. Neighbors are invited and presented with turmeric, fruits, flowers, etc. as gifts. At night, prayers are held with singing and dancing. In south Indian states such as Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, the Kethara Gauri Vritham festival is celebrated on the new moon day of Diwali and married women fast for the day, prepare sweets and worship Parvati for the well-being of the family.

Thiruvathira is a festival observed in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It is believed that on this day, Parvati met Shiva after her long penance and Shiva took her as his wife. On this day Hindu women perform the Thiruvathirakali accompanied by Thiruvathira paattu (folk songs about Parvati and her longing and penance for Lord Shiva&#x27;s affection).

===Arts===

From sculpture to dance, many Indian arts explore and express the stories of Parvati and Shiva as themes. For example, &quot;Daksha Yagam&quot; of Kathakali, a form of dance-drama choreography, adapts the romantic episodes of Parvati and Shiva.

The Gauri-Shankar bead is a part of religious adornment rooted in the belief of Parvati and Shiva as the ideal equal complementing halves of the other. Gauri-Shankar is a particular &quot;rudraksha&quot; (bead) formed naturally from the seed of a tree found in India. Two seeds of this tree sometimes naturally grow as fused and are considered symbolic of Parvati and Shiva. These seeds are strung into garlands and worn, or used in &quot;malas&quot; (rosaries) for meditation in Saivism.

===Numismatics===
Ancient coins from Bactria (Central Asia) of Kushan Empire era, and those of king Harsha (North India) feature Uma. These were issued sometime between the 3rd- and 7th-century AD. In Bactria, Uma is spelled &quot;Ommo&quot;, and she appears on coins holding a flower. On her coin is also shown Shiva, who is sometimes shown in the ithyphallic state holding a trident and standing near Nandi (his &quot;vahana&quot;). On coins issued by king Harsha, Parvati and Shiva are seated on a bull and the reverse of the coin has Brahmi script.

==Major temples==
Parvati is often present with Shiva in Saivite Hindu temples all over South Asia and Southeast Asia.

Some locations (&quot;Pithas&quot; or &quot;Shaktipeeths&quot;) are considered special because of their historical importance and legends about their origins in the ancient texts of Hinduism.

===List of temples===

Each major Parvati-Shiva temple is a pilgrimage site that has an ancient legend associated with it, which is typically a part of a larger story that links these Hindu temples across South Asia with each other. Some temples where Parvati can be found include:
* in Jammu and Kashmir: Udhampur District, Jammu Mantalai Temple and Gauri Kund

==Outside India==

Sculpture and iconography of Parvati, in one of her many manifestations, have been found in temples and literature of Southeast Asia. For example, early Saivite inscriptions of the Khmer in Cambodia, dated as early as the fifth century AD, mention Parvati (Uma) and Siva. Many ancient and medieval era Cambodian temples, rock arts and river bed carvings such as the Kbal Spean are dedicated to Parvati and Shiva.

Boisselier has identified Uma in a Champa era temple in Vietnam.

Dozens of ancient temples dedicated to Parvati as Uma, with Siva, have been found in the islands of Indonesia and Malaysia. Her manifestation as Durga has also been found in southeast Asia. Many of the temples in Java dedicated to Siva-Parvati are from the second half of 1st millennium AD, and some from later centuries. Durga icons and worship have been dated to be from the 10th- to 13th-century.
Derived from Parvati&#x27;s form as Mahakali, her form is Daikokutennyo (大黒天女).

In Nakhorn Si Thammarat province of Thailand, excavations at Dev Sathan have yielded a Hindu Temple dedicated to Vishnu (Na Pra Narai), a lingam in the &quot;yoni&quot;, a Shiva temple (San Pra Isuan). The sculpture of Parvati found at this excavation site reflects the South Indian style.

; Bali, Indonesia
Parvati, locally spelled as &quot;Parwati&quot;, is a principal goddess in modern-day Hinduism of Bali. She is more often called &quot;Uma&quot;, and sometimes referred to as &quot;Giriputri&quot; (daughter of the mountains). She is the goddess of mountain Gunung Agung. Like Hinduism of India, Uma has many manifestations in Bali, Indonesia. She is married to deity &quot;Siwa&quot;. Uma or Parwati is considered as the mother goddess that nurtures, nourishes, grants fertility to crop and all life. As &quot;Dewi Danu&quot;, she presides over waters, lake Batur and Gunung Batur, a major volcano in Bali. Her ferocious form in Bali is &quot;Dewi Durga&quot;. As &quot;Rangda&quot;, she is wrathful and presides over cemeteries. As &quot;Ibu Pertiwi&quot;, Parwati of Balinese Hinduism is the goddess of earth. The legends about various manifestations of Parwati, and how she changes from one form to another, are in Balinese literature, such as the palm-leaf (&quot;lontar&quot;) manuscript &quot;Andabhuana&quot;.

==Related goddesses==
Tara found in some sects of Buddhism, particularly Tibetan and Nepalese, is related to Parvati. Tara too appears in many manifestations. In tantric sects of Buddhism, as well as Hinduism, intricate symmetrical art forms of yantra or mandala are dedicated to different aspects of Tara and Parvati.

Parvati is closely related in symbolism and powers to Cybele of Greek and Roman mythology and as Vesta the guardian goddess of children. In her manifestation as &quot;Durga&quot;, Parvati parallels Mater Montana. She is the equivalent of the &quot;Magna Mater&quot; (Universal Mother). As &quot;Kali&quot; and punisher of all evil, she corresponds to Proserpine and Diana Taurica.

As &quot;Bhawani&quot; and goddess of fertility and birthing, she is the symbolic equivalent of Ephesian &quot;Diana&quot;. In Crete, &quot;Rhea&quot; is the mythological figure, goddess of the mountains, paralleling Parvati; while in some mythologies from islands of Greece, the terrifying goddess mirroring Parvati is &quot;Diktynna&quot; (also called Britomartis). At Ephesus, Cybele is shown with lions, just like the iconography of Parvati is sometimes shown with a lion.

Carl Jung, in &quot;Mysterium Coniunctionis&quot;, states that aspects of Parvati belong to the same category of goddesses like Artemis, Isis and Mary. Edmund Leach equates Parvati in her relationship with Shiva, with that of the Greek goddess Aphrodite – a symbol of sexual love.

During the Second World War he was the first British prisoner-of-war to succeed in escaping from Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle, and later worked for MI9. After the war he served with the International Military Tribunal at the Nuremberg trials. He later became Conservative MP for Abingdon.

Neave was assassinated in a car bomb attack at the House of Commons. The Irish National Liberation Army claimed responsibility.

==Early life==
Neave was the son of Sheffield Airey Neave CMG, OBE (1879–1961), an entomologist, who lived at Ingatestone, Essex, and his wife Dorothy, the daughter of Arthur Thomson Middleton. His father was the grandson of Sheffield Neave, the third son of Sir Thomas Neave, 2nd Baronet (see Neave baronets).

The family came to prominence as merchants in the West Indies during the 18th century and were raised to the baronetage during the life of Richard Neave, Governor of the Bank of England. Neave spent his early years in Knightsbridge in London, before he moved to Beaconsfield. Neave was sent to St. Ronan&#x27;s School, Worthing, and from there, in 1929, he went to Eton College. He went on to read Jurisprudence at Merton College, Oxford.

While at Eton, Neave composed a prize-winning essay in 1933 that examined the likely consequences of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to supreme power in Germany, and Neave predicted then that another widespread war would break out in Europe in the near future. Neave had earlier been on a visit to Germany, and he witnessed the Nazi German methods of grasping political and military power. At Eton, Neave served in the school cadet corps as a cadet lance corporal, and received a territorial commission as a second lieutenant in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry on 11 December 1935.

When Neave went to Oxford University, he purchased and read the entire written works of the general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. When Neave was asked why, he answered: &quot;since war [is] coming, it [is] only sensible to learn as much as possible about the art of waging it&quot;. During 1938, Neave completed his third-class degree. By his own admission, while at Oxford University, he did only the minimum amount of academic work that was required of him by his tutors.

==Second World War==
Neave transferred his territorial commission to the Royal Engineers on 2 May 1938 and following the outbreak of war he was mobilised. Sent to France in February 1940 with 1st Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery, he was wounded and captured by the Germans at Calais on 23 May 1940. He was imprisoned at Oflag IX-A/H near Spangenberg and in February 1941 moved to Stalag XX-A near Thorn in German-occupied western Poland. Meanwhile, Neave&#x27;s commission was transferred to the Royal Artillery on 1 August 1940.

In April 1941 he escaped from Thorn with Norman Forbes. They were captured near Ilow while trying to enter Soviet-controlled Poland and were briefly in the hands of the Gestapo. In May, they were both sent to Oflag IV-C (often referred to as Colditz Castle because of its location).

While in Colditz, the French military prisoners asked the Germans to have the Jewish military prisoners separated from the gentile French military prisoners, which resulted in about 80 French Jewish military prisoners being confined in a crowded attic of the castle. Neave and many British officers were appalled at the French prisoners for this request. In demonstration of their solidarity with the French Jews, the British invited the French Jews to dinner in the British mess, where Neave made a speech denouncing the prejudice.

Neave made his first attempt to escape from Colditz on 28 August 1941 disguised as a German NCO. He did not get out of the castle as his hastily contrived German uniform (made from a Polish army tunic and cap painted with scenery paint accompanied with cardboard belt painted silver) was rendered bright green under the prison searchlights. The disguise was so poor that guards came to see it; prison official Paul Priem joked that &quot;Corporal Neave is to be sent to the Russian front&quot;. Together with Dutch officer Anthony Luteyn he made a second attempt on 5 January 1942, again in disguise.

Better uniforms and escape route (they made a quick exit from a theatrical production using the trap door beneath the stage) got them out of the prison and by train and on foot they travelled to Leipzig and Ulm and finally reached the border to Switzerland near Singen. Via France, Spain and Gibraltar, Neave returned to England in April 1942. Neave was the first British officer to escape from Colditz Castle. On 12 May 1942, shortly after his return to England, he was decorated with the Military Cross. He was subsequently promoted to war substantive captain and to the permanent rank of captain on 11 April 1945. A temporary major at the war&#x27;s end, he was appointed an MBE (Military Division) on 30 August 1945, and awarded the DSO on 18 October. As a result, the earlier MBE appointment was cancelled on 25 October 1945.

After his escape from the Germans, Neave was recruited as an intelligence officer for MI9, supporting underground escape organizations, such as the Pat O&#x27;Leary Line and Comet Line in occupied Europe, with equipment, agents and money; assisting downed Allied airmen and other Allied military personnel evade and escape capture by the Germans. In Western Europe, about 5,000 British and American military personnel were rescued by the escape organizations and repatriated to the United Kingdom, mostly through neutral Spain, before D-Day. After D-Day in Operation Marathon, Neave journeyed to France and Belgium and, with help from the Comet Line and the Resistance, rescued more than 300 allied airmen who had taken refuge in forest camps after being shot down. While at MI9, he was the immediate superior of the future comedian Michael Bentine, also an Old Etonian.

He also served with the International Military Tribunal at the Nuremberg trials, investigating Krupp. He was supported by the work of his secretary Joan Tutte. As a well-known war hero – as well as a qualified lawyer who spoke fluent German – he was honoured with the role of reading the indictments to the Nazi leaders on trial. He wrote several books about his war experiences including an account of the trials.

A temporary lieutenant-colonel by 1947, he was appointed an OBE (Military Division) in that year&#x27;s Birthday Honours. He was awarded the Bronze Star by the US government on 20 July 1948, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 1 April 1950, At the same time, his promotion to acting major was gazetted, with retroactive effect from 16 April 1948. He entered the reserves on 21 September 1951.

==Political career==
Neave stood for the Conservative Party at the 1950 election in Thurrock and at Ealing North in 1951. He was elected for Abingdon in a by-election in June 1953, but his career was held back by a heart attack he suffered in 1959.

He was a Governor of Imperial College between 1963 and 1971 and was a member of the House of Commons select committee on Science and Technology between 1965 and 1970. He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1953 to 1979.

Edward Heath, when Chief Whip, was alleged to have told Neave that after he suffered his heart attack his career was finished but in his 1998 autobiography, Heath strongly denied ever making such a remark. He admitted that in December 1974 Neave had told him to stand down for the good of the party. During the final two months of 1974, Neave had asked Keith Joseph, William Whitelaw and Edward du Cann to stand against Heath, and said that in the case of any of them challenging for the party leadership, he would be their campaign manager. When all three refused to stand, Neave agreed to be the campaign manager for Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s attempt to become leader of the Conservative Party, which was eventually successful.

When Thatcher was elected leader in February 1975, Neave was rewarded by becoming head of her private office. He was then appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and, at the time of his death, was poised to attain the equivalent Cabinet position in the event of the Conservatives winning the general election of 1979. In opposition, Neave was a strong supporter of Roy Mason, who had extended the policy of Ulsterisation.

Neave was author of the new and radical Conservative policy of abandoning devolution in Northern Ireland if there was no early progress in that regard, and concentrating on local government reform instead. This integrationist policy was hastily abandoned by Humphrey Atkins, who became Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the role Neave had shadowed.

Politician Tony Benn records in his diary (17 February 1981) that a journalist from the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Duncan Campbell, told him that he had received information two years previously, from an intelligence agent, that Neave had planned to have Benn assassinated if, following the election of Labour government, Labour leader James Callaghan resigned and there was a possibility that Benn might be elected in his place. Campbell said that the agent was ready to give his name and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; was going to print the story. Benn, however, discounted the validity of the story, writing in his diary: &quot;No one will believe for a moment that Airey Neave would have done such a thing.&quot; The magazine printed the story on 20 February 1981, naming the agent as Lee Tracey. Tracey said he had met Neave, who asked him to join a team of intelligence and security specialists which would &quot;make sure Benn was stopped&quot;. A planned second meeting never took place because Neave was murdered with a car bomb.

==Assassination==

Airey Neave was critically wounded on 30 March 1979 when a car bomb fitted with a tilt-switch exploded under his Vauxhall Cavalier at 14:59 as he drove out of the Palace of Westminster car park. He lost both legs in the explosion and died of his wounds at Westminster Hospital an hour after being rescued from the wrecked car. He was 63.

The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) afterwards claimed responsibility for the assassination. Neave had been pressing within Conservative Party circles and in Parliament throughout the Troubles for the British Government to abandon its strategy of containment (including &quot;Ulsterisation&quot;) of Irish republican paramilitarism within Northern Ireland, and switch to one of pursuing its military defeat. It is believed that this is what led to his being targeted.

Following his death, Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher said of Neave:

Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan said: &quot;No effort will be spared to bring the murderers to justice and to rid the United Kingdom of the scourge of terrorism.&quot;

The INLA issued a statement regarding the murder in the August 1979 edition of &quot;The Starry Plough&quot;:

Neave&#x27;s death came two days after the vote of no confidence which brought down Callaghan&#x27;s government and a few weeks before the general election, which brought about a Conservative victory and saw Thatcher come to power as Prime Minister. Neave&#x27;s wife Diana, whom he married on 29 December 1942, was subsequently elevated to the House of Lords as Baroness Airey of Abingdon.

Neave&#x27;s biographer Paul Routledge met a member of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (the political wing of INLA) who was involved in the killing of Neave and who told Routledge that Neave &quot;would have been very successful at that job [Northern Ireland Secretary]. He would have brought the armed struggle to its knees&quot;.

As a result of Neave&#x27;s assassination the INLA was declared illegal across the whole of the United Kingdom on 2 July 1979.

Neave&#x27;s killing has been the subject of conspiracy theories. Enoch Powell claimed that his death was the result of a British-American conspiracy to secure a united Irish state that would be a part of NATO.

==Media depictions==
Neave was portrayed by Geoffrey Pounsett in &quot;Nuremberg&quot; (2000), Dermot Crowley in &quot;Margaret&quot; (2009), Nicholas Farrell in &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; (2011) (in a piece of dramatic licence Thatcher is shown in that film as an eyewitness to his death) and Tim McInnerny in &quot;Utopia&quot; (2014).

In 2014, 35 years after Neave&#x27;s death, a fictionalised account of Neave&#x27;s murder was depicted in the Channel 4 drama &quot;Utopia&quot;, where he was portrayed as a drinker who colluded with spies and whose assassination was perpetrated by MI5. This led to condemnation of the broadcaster, with Norman Tebbit, a friend and political colleague of Neave, saying &quot;To attack a man like that who is dead and cannot defend himself is despicable&quot;.

<text>An environmentally sensitive area (ESA) is a type of designation for an agricultural area which needs special protection because of its landscape, wildlife or historical value. The scheme was introduced in 1987. Originally it was administered by Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, then the Rural Development Service for the United Kingdom Governments Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and currently Natural England following successive re-organisation of the departments. In 2005 the scheme was superseded by Environmental Stewardship and closed to new entrants. Existing agreements remain active until they expire, meaning the designation will remain active until 2014.

Farmers entered into a 10-year contract with the government and received an annual payment for the area that is part of the scheme. Farmers were expected to adopt environmentally friendly agricultural practices.

There are 22 ESAs in England:
*Avon Valley
*Blackdown Hills
*Breckland
*Broads
*River Clun
*Cotswold Hills
*Dartmoor
*Essex Coast
*Exmoor
*Lake District
*North Kent Marshes
*North Peak
*Pennine Dales
*Shropshire Hills
*Somerset Levels and Moors
*South Downs
*South Wessex Downs
*South West Peak
*Suffolk River Valleys
*Test Valley

<text>A special protection area (SPA) is a designation under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. Under the Directive, Member States of the European Union (EU) have a duty to safeguard the habitats of migratory birds and certain particularly threatened birds. Together with special areas of conservation (SACs), the SPAs form a network of protected sites across the EU, called Natura 2000. Each SPA has an EU code – for example the North Norfolk Coast SPA has the code &quot;UK9009031&quot;.

==In the United Kingdom==
As at 21 September 2006, there were 252 classified SPAs and 12 proposed SPAs in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The Conservation (Natural Habitats etc.) Regulations 1994 implement the terms of the Directive in Scotland, England and Wales. In Great Britain, SPAs (and SACs) designated on land or in the intertidal area are normally also notified as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), and in Northern Ireland as Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs). For example, the Broadland SPA in eastern England is a conglomeration of some 28 SSSIs. SPAs may extend below low tide into the sea, and for these areas SSSI notification is not possible. In Scotland, some SPAs have been classified without any underpinning designation by SSSI.

==In Poland==

&quot;Special Protection Areas&quot; for Birds in Poland are called OSOPs (). As of 2005, there were 72 OSOP Areas designated as such.

==In the Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, &quot;Special Protection Areas&quot; for birds are called &quot;Vogelrichtlijngebied&quot;.

==In Portugal==
The Castro Verde SPA extends into six municipalities of Baixo Alentejo Subregion: Aljustrel, Almodôvar Municipality, Beja Municipality, Castro Verde Municipality, Mértola and Ourique Municipality, a total area of 79,007 hectares (790 km 2).

==In Spain==
The Spanish term is &quot;ZEPA&quot;.
There were 658 Spanish sites as at 2021.

== In the Czech Republic ==
The Czech Republic uses the term &quot;Ptačí oblast&quot; (PO, bird area) for SPAs. Between 2004 and 2009, 41 bird areas were declared by government directives. They cover 9% of the state area.

<doc id="100180" wikidata="Q154554" url="?curid=100180" title="Iron Cross">
<text>The Iron Cross (, , abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire (1871–1918), and later in Nazi Germany (1933–1945). The design, a black cross pattée with a white or silver outline, was derived from the insignia of the medieval Teutonic Order and borne by its knights from the 13th century. As well as being a military medal, it has also been used as an emblem by the Prussian Army, the Imperial German Army, and the of the Weimar Republic, while the &quot;Balkenkreuz&quot; (bar cross) variant was used by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. The Iron Cross is now the emblem of the , the modern German armed forces.
King Frederick William III of Prussia established the Iron Cross award on 17 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). The award was backdated to the birthday (10 March) of his late wife, Queen Louise, who was the first person to receive it (posthumously). The Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939). During World War II, the Nazi regime made their own version by superimposing a swastika on the medal. The Iron Cross was usually a military decoration only, though some were awarded to civilians for performing military roles, including Hanna Reitsch and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg for being civilian test pilots during World War II.

Since the late 20th century, the symbol has also been adopted into the outlaw motorcycle subculture and Heavy Metal fashion.
==Black Cross emblem==
The Black Cross (&quot;Schwarzes Kreuz&quot;) is the emblem used by the Prussian Army and Germany&#x27;s army from 1871 to the present. It was designed on the occasion of the German Campaign of 1813, when Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia commissioned the Iron Cross as the first military decoration open to all ranks, including enlisted men. From this time, the Black Cross was featured on the Prussian war flag alongside the Black Eagle. It was designed by neoclassical architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, based on Friedrich Wilhelm III. The design is ultimately derivative of the black cross used by the Teutonic Order. This heraldic cross took various forms throughout the order&#x27;s history, including a Latin cross, a cross potent, cross fleury, and occasionally also a cross pattée.

When the Quadriga of the Goddess of Peace was retrieved from Paris at Napoleon&#x27;s fall, it was re-established atop Berlin&#x27;s Brandenburg Gate. An Iron Cross was inserted into Peace&#x27;s laurel wreath, making her into a Goddess of Victory. In 1821 Schinkel crowned the top of his design of the National Monument for the Liberation Wars with an Iron Cross, becoming name-giving as Kreuzberg (cross mountain) for the hill it stands on and, 100 years later, for the homonymous quarter adjacent to it.

The Black Cross was used on the naval and combat flags of the German Empire. The Black Cross was used as the German Army symbol until 1915 when a simpler Balkenkreuz replaced it. The of the Weimar Republic (1921–35), the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; of Nazi Germany (1935–45), and the (1 October 1956 to present) also inherited the use of the emblem in various forms. The traditional design in black is used on armored vehicles and aircraft, while after German reunification, a new creation in blue and silver was introduced for use in other contexts.

==Medal and ribbon design==
The ribbon for the 1813, 1870 and 1914 Iron Cross (2nd Class) was black with two thin white bands, the colors of Prussia. The non-combatant version of this award had the same medal, but the black and white colors on the ribbon were reversed. The ribbon color for the 1939 EKII was black/white/red/white/black.

Since the Iron Cross was issued over several different periods of German history, it was annotated with the year indicating the era in which it was issued. For example, an Iron Cross from World War I bears the year &quot;1914&quot;, while the same decoration from World War II is annotated &quot;1939&quot;. The reverse of the 1870, 1914 and 1939 series of Iron Crosses have the year &quot;1813&quot; appearing on the lower arm, symbolizing the year the award was created. The 1813 decoration also has the initials &quot;FW&quot; for King Friedrich Wilhelm III, while the next two have a &quot;W&quot; for the respective kaisers, Wilhelm I and Wilhelm II. The final version shows a swastika representing the Nazi Party instead of a letter for a German monarch. There was also the &quot;1957&quot; issue, a replacement medal for holders of the 1939 series which substituted an oak-leaf cluster for the banned swastika.

When the Iron Cross was reauthorized for World War I in 1914, it was possible for individuals who had previously been awarded one in 1870 to be subsequently granted another. These recipients were recognized with the award of a clasp featuring a miniaturized 1914 Iron Cross on a metal bar. The award was quite rare, since by this time there were few in service who held the 1870 Iron Cross. In World War II it was also possible for a holder of the 1914 Iron Cross to be awarded a second or higher grade of the 1939 Iron Cross. In such cases, a &quot;1939 Clasp&quot; (&quot;&quot;) would be worn on the original 1914 Iron Cross. For the 1st Class award, the Spange appears as an eagle with the date &quot;1939&quot;. This was pinned to the uniform above the original medal. Although they were two separate awards in some cases the holders soldered them together.

A cross has been the symbol of Germany&#x27;s armed forces (now the &quot;&quot;) since 1871.

==Wars of Liberation==

On 17 March 1813 King Frederick William III of Prussia, who had fled to non-occupied Breslau (today Wrocław), established the military decoration of the Iron Cross, backdated to 10 March (the late Queen Louise&#x27;s birthday). The Iron Cross was awarded to soldiers during the Wars of Liberation against Napoleon. Before a soldier could be awarded with the Iron Cross 1st Class, he needed to have been decorated with the Iron Cross 2nd Class. It was first awarded to Karl August Ferdinand von Borcke on 21 April 1813. The first form of the Iron Crosses 1st Class were stitched in ribbon to the left uniform breast. By order of 1 June 1813, the 2nd form was created in cast iron with silver borders, and 8 loops on the reverse, to be fixed to the left uniform breast. In 1817 a total of 670 chevaliers had received the Iron Cross 1st Class.

==Franco-Prussian War==
King Wilhelm I of Prussia authorized further awards on 19 July 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. Recipients of the 1870 Iron Cross who were still in service in 1895 were authorized to purchase and wear above the cross a &quot;&quot; (&quot;Jubilee clip&quot;), a 25-year clasp consisting of the numerals &quot;25&quot; on three oak leaves.

William Manley is possibly the only recipient of both the Iron Cross and the Victoria Cross. He was awarded the Iron Cross for service with an ambulance unit in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71.

==World War I==
Emperor Wilhelm II reauthorized the Iron Cross on 5 August 1914, at the start of World War I. During these three periods, the Iron Cross was an award of the Kingdom of Prussia, although—given Prussia&#x27;s pre-eminent place in the German Empire formed in 1871—it tended to be treated as a generic German decoration. The 1813, 1870, and 1914 Iron Crosses had three grades:

* Iron Cross, 2nd class, (&quot;, or EKII)
* Iron Cross, 1st class, (&quot;, or EKI)
* Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (&#x27;, often simply &#x27;)

Although the obverse of the medals of each class was identical, the manner in which each was worn differed. The Iron Cross, 1st class, employed a pin or screw posts on the back of the medal, and was worn on the left side of the recipient&#x27;s uniform, like the original 1813 version. The Iron Cross 2nd Class, and the larger Grand Cross, were suspended from different ribbons: the Grand Cross from a neck ribbon, the 2nd Class from a ribbon on the chest. The usual display of the 2nd Class version was as a ribbon through one of the button holes in the recipient&#x27;s tunic.

The Grand Cross was intended for senior generals of the Prussian or (later) the German Army. An even higher decoration, the Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (also called the &quot;Blücher Star&quot;), was awarded only twice, to Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher in 1813 and to Paul von Hindenburg in 1918. A third award was planned for the most successful German general during World War II, but was not made after the defeat of Germany in 1945.

The Iron Cross, 1st class, and the Iron Cross, 2nd class, were awarded without regard to rank. One had to possess the 2nd Class already in order to receive the 1st Class (though in some cases both could be awarded simultaneously). The egalitarian nature of this award contrasted with those of most other German states (and indeed of many other European monarchies), where military decorations were awarded based on the rank of the recipient. For example, Bavarian officers received various grades of that Kingdom&#x27;s Military Merit Order (&#x27;), while enlisted men received various grades of the Military Merit Cross (&#x27;). Prussia did have other orders and medals which it awarded on the basis of rank, and even though the Iron Cross was intended to be awarded without regard to rank, officers and NCOs were more likely to receive it than junior enlisted soldiers.

During World War I, approximately 218,000 EKIs, 5,196,000 EKIIs and 13,000 non-combatant EKIIs were awarded. Exact numbers of awards are not known, since the Prussian military archives were destroyed during World War II. The multitude of awards reduced the status and reputation of the decoration. Among the holders of the 1914 Iron Cross, 2nd class, and 1st Class was Adolf Hitler, who served as an Austrian citizen in the Bavarian Army with the rank of &quot;&quot; (lance-corporal), he received these medals for showing bravery on the field of battle. Most photographs of Hitler show him wearing his EKI in standard fashion on his left breast.

===Allied Propaganda versions===

In 1914, a variety of very crude anti-German propaganda versions of the Iron Cross were created by the Allies, and sold to raise money for the war effort and the relief of Belgian refugees. One was inscribed &quot;FOR KULTUR&quot; in raised letters, another &quot;FOR BRUTALITY.&quot; Yet another showed the names of French and Belgian towns attacked or destroyed during the retreat from Mons on the ends of the upper arms of the cross; these included Rheims, Louvain and Amiens on one side, and Antwerp, Dinant and Ghent on the other, with the date 1914 on the lower arm, and a central W for Kaiser Wilhelm as on the original. Another commemorated the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, showing the names of these &quot;war atrocities&quot; on the arms of the cross.

==World War II==
Adolf Hitler restored the Iron Cross in 1939 as a German decoration (rather than Prussian), and continued the tradition of issuing it in various classes. Legally, it is based on the &quot;Enactment for the re-introduction of the Iron Cross&quot; (&#x27;) of 1 September 1939. The Iron Cross of World War II was divided into three main series of decorations: the Iron Cross (the lowest), the Knight&#x27;s Cross (intermediate), and the Grand Cross (the highest). The Knight&#x27;s Cross replaced the Prussian &#x27; or &quot;Blue Max&quot;. Hitler did not care for the &quot;, as it was a Prussian order that could be awarded only to officers. The ribbon of the medal (2nd class and Knight&#x27;s Cross) was different from the earlier Iron Crosses as the color red was used in addition to the traditional black and white (black and white were the colors of Prussia, while black, white, and red were the colors of Nazi Germany). Hitler also created the War Merit Cross as a replacement for the non-combatant version of the Iron Cross. It also appeared on certain Nazi flags in the upper left corner. The sides of the cross were curved, like most original iron crosses.

===Iron Cross (1939)===

The standard 1939 Iron Cross was issued in the following two grades:
* Iron Cross, 2nd class, (&quot; – abbreviated as EK II or E.K.II.)
* Iron Cross, 1st class, (&quot;&quot; – abbreviated as EK I or E.K.I.)

The Iron Cross was awarded for bravery in battle as well as other military contributions in a battlefield environment.

The Iron Cross, 2nd class, came with a ribbon and the cross itself was worn in one of two different ways:

* From the second button in the tunic from the first day after award.
* When in formal dress, the entire cross was worn mounted alone or as part of a medal bar.

Note that for everyday wear, only the ribbon was worn from the second buttonhole in the tunic.

The Iron Cross, 1st class, was a pin-on medal with no ribbon and was worn centered on a uniform breast pocket, either on dress uniforms or everyday outfit. It was a progressive award, with the second class having to be earned before the first class and so on for the higher degrees.

It is estimated that some four and a half million 2nd Class Iron Crosses were awarded during World War II, and 300,000 of the 1st Class.

Thirty-nine women, chiefly female nurses from the German Red Cross were granted the Iron Cross 2nd Class. Example of such women are Elfriede Wnuk, wounded in 1942 on the Eastern Front, Magda Darchniger, decorated in 1942, Marga Droste, who remained at her post in the Wilhelmshaven hospital despite her own wounds during a bombing in 1942, Ilse Schulz and Grete Fock, who served in the African campaign, Liselotte Hensel and Miss Holzmann, who were both decorated in 1943 for bravery during a bombing of Hamburg, and the countess Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, acting as a qualified test pilot and development engineer and decorated in August 1943. Other DRK female auxiliaries who received the Iron Cross for acts of bravery are Hanny Weber, Geolinde Münchge, Elfriede Gunia, Ruth Raabe, Ilse Daub, Greta Graffenkamp, Elfriede Muth, Ursula Kogel, Liselotte Schlotterbeck, Rohna von Ceuern, Anna Wohlschütz, and Dr. Elizabeth Potuz. Two non-German female auxiliaries of the German Red Cross were awarded the Iron Cross: Norwegian nurse Anne Gunhild Moxnes in April 1944, and an unknown Belgian nurse in 1942. A young member of the female youth organisation of the Third Reich, Ottilie Stephan, was also awarded the Iron Cross in February 1945 under unknown circumstances. At least two Iron Cross, 1st class, recipients were women, test pilot (&quot;Flugkapitän&quot;) Hanna Reitsch and in January 1945 German Red Cross sister Else Grossmann.

One of the Muslim SS members to receive the award, SS &quot; Imam Halim Malkoč was granted the Iron Cross (2nd Class) in October 1943 for his role in suppressing the Villefranche-de-Rouergue mutiny. He, together with several other Bosnian Muslims, was decorated with the EK II personally by Himmler in the days after the mutiny. Because of his Muslim faith, he wore only the ribbon, and not the cross. Three Finnish Jews were awarded the Iron Cross: Major Leo Skurnik and Captain Salomon Klass of the Finnish Army and nurse Dina Poljakoff from the Lotta Svärd organization. All three refused the award. The Spanish double-agent Juan Pujol García, known to the Germans as and the British as received the 2nd Class Iron Cross, and an MBE from King George VI four months later.

===Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross===
The Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross (&#x27;, often simply &#x27;) recognized military valour or successful leadership. The Knight&#x27;s Cross was divided into five degrees:
*Knight&#x27;s Cross (&quot;)
*Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves (&quot;)
*Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (&quot;)
*Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (&quot;)
*Knight&#x27;s Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (&quot;)

In total, 7,313 awards of the Knight&#x27;s Cross were made. Only 883 received the Oak Leaves; 160 both the Oak Leaves and Swords (including Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (posthumously)); 27 with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds; and one with the Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (&quot;&quot; Hans-Ulrich Rudel).

===Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (1939)===
Like the Knight&#x27;s Cross, the Grand Cross (&#x27;) was worn suspended from the collar. It was reserved for general officers for &quot;the most outstanding strategic decisions affecting the course of the war&quot;. The only recipient during the Second World War was &#x27; Hermann Göring, who was awarded the decoration on 19 July 1940 for his command of the &quot;&quot;, after the Battle of France in 1940.

The medal is a larger version of the Knight&#x27;s Cross, measuring wide as opposed to about for the Iron Cross and for the Knight&#x27;s Cross. It was originally intended to have outer edges lined in gold, but this was changed to silver before the award was presented. It was worn with a wide ribbon bearing the same colors as the Knight&#x27;s Cross and 2nd Class ribbons. The award case was in red leather with the eagle and the swastika outlined in gold.

The original Grand Cross presented to Göring (personally by Hitler) was destroyed during an air raid on his Berlin home. Göring had extra copies made, one of them with a platinum frame that he was wearing at the time of his surrender to the allies in 1945.

==Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross==

The Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (also called Iron Cross with Golden Rays) was pinned to the left breast, above the Iron Cross 1st Class. Like the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross, it was for bestowal upon successful general officers.

The Star of the Grand Cross was awarded only twice, both to Field Marshals who already held the Grand Cross: in 1815 to Gebhard von Blücher for his part in the Battle of Waterloo, and in March 1918 to Paul von Hindenburg for his conduct of the 1918 Spring Offensive on the Western Front. It is often called the Blücher Star &quot;()&quot;, after its first recipient.

A Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross was manufactured in World War II, but never formally instituted or awarded. The only known example, based on the World War I version but with the 1939 Iron Cross centerpiece, was found by Allied forces at the end of the war, and it is now in the museum at West Point. It is likely that &quot; Göring was the intended eventual recipient. He was the only holder of the World War II Iron Cross Grand Cross, and both the previous recipients of the Star had already received the Grand Cross.

==Side features of the Iron Cross and entitlements==
Officers awarded the Iron Cross were given entitlements and often wore signifying articles, such as an Iron Cross signet ring or cloth Iron Cross which could be affixed to clothing. Also, during the Nazi period, those attaining more than one award, for example, an officer who had attained an Iron Cross 2nd Class, an Iron Cross 1st Class, and the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with the Oak Leaves, were entitled to wear a pin which exhibited three Iron Crosses with an exaggerated swastika, thereby consolidating the awards.

In some cases, Minox miniature cameras were given to people together with an Iron Cross.

==Post-World War II==

As modern German law prohibits the production and display of items containing Nazi insignia, the West German government authorized replacement Iron Crosses in 1957 with a trifoliate Oak Leaf Cluster in place of the swastika, similar to the Iron Crosses of 1813, 1870, and 1914, which could be worn by World War II Iron Cross recipients. The 1957 law also authorized de-Nazified versions of most other World War II-era decorations (except those specifically associated with Nazi Party organizations, such as SS Long Service medals, or with the expansion of the German &quot;, such as the medals for the annexation of Austria, the Sudetenland and the Memel region).

After post-war German armed forces began seeing active service, first in Kosovo and then in Afghanistan, a campaign began to revive the Iron Cross and other military medals, since Germany had no awards specifically for active military service. In 2007, a petition to the German parliament to revive the Iron Cross decoration was initiated, quickly receiving over 5,000 signatures. On 13 December 2007 parliament decided to let the Ministry of Defence decide the matter. On 6 March 2008, President Horst Köhler approved a proposal by Minister of Defense Franz Josef Jung to institute a new award for bravery. The &#x27; (Badge of Honor of the German Armed Forces) series was instituted on 10 October 2008. However, it does not have the traditional form of the Iron Cross (instead more closely resembling the Prussian Military Merit Cross), but is seen as a supplement of existing awards of the &#x27;.

===Biker and heavy metal subcultures===

In the United States, the Iron Cross was adopted by outlaw motorcycle clubs in the 1960s, as a symbol of rebellion and probably for shock value. From biker subculture it spread to rock and heavy metal subcultures, becoming part of heavy metal fashion. Lemmy Kilmister of the influential band Motörhead often wore one. In the 1990s, this other use of the Iron Cross had spread from bikers to skateboarders and many extreme sports enthusiasts and became part of the logo of several related clothing companies. The Anti-Defamation League states that the version of the symbol with a swastika has been commonly used by neo-Nazis and other white supremacists as a hate symbol since it was discontinued following World War II, but the wider use of the Iron Cross in various subcultures means determining its use as a hate symbol relies on context: &quot;an Iron Cross in isolation (i.e., without a superimposed swastika or without other accompanying hate symbols) cannot be determined to be a hate symbol&quot;.

<doc id="100185" wikidata="Q3429981" url="?curid=100185" title="Gauri (raga)">
<text>Gauri is an India musical raga that appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Sikh holy scripture called Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used; which notes can be used; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune. there are Gouris of the Bhairav, Poorvi and Marwa thats with additional qualifiers such as the Shree-anga Gouri, Bhairav-anga Gouri, Poorvi-anga Gouri and so on. These are not considered ‘big’ ragas.

In the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy Granth (book) there are a total of 60 raga compositions and this raga is the ninth raga to appear in the series. The composition in this raga first appear on ang (page) no. 151.

Raag Gauri (ਗਉੜੀ) – Gauri creates a mood where the listener is encouraged to strive harder in order to achieve an objective. However, the encouragement given by the Raag does not allow the ego to increase. This therefore creates the atmosphere where the listener is encouraged, but still prevented from becoming arrogant and self-important.

== Variants ==
Gauri was used by Guru Nanak, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur. Several forms of Gauri Raga exist historically and this probably accounts for the large number of variants:
* Gauri (Bhairav thaat)
* Gauri (Kalingada aang) (2 M&#x27;s)
* Gauri (Marwa aang)
* Gauri Bairagan
* Gauri Basant
* Gauri Chayti
* Gauri Cheti
* Gauri Dakhani
* Gauri Deepaki
* Gauri Guarairi
* Gauri Majh
* Gauri Mala
* Gauri Malva
* Gauri Purbi
* Gauri Purbi Deepaki
* Gauri Sorath

== Composition of the raga ==
* Aroh: Sa Re Ga Re Ma Pa Ni Sa
* Avroh: Sa Ni Dha Ma Pa, Dha Pa Ma Ga, Ga Re Sa Ni Sa
* Vadi: Re
* Samvadi: Pa

Occasionally Re is performed with a vibrate as in Siri Raga which has the same vadis. Ni is given prominence through either stopping or lingering on this note.

This raga is associated with Bhairav thaat.
But it is played in various angs (forms) :
* Gauri (Bhairav thaat)
* Gauri (Kalingada aang) (2 M&#x27;s)
* Gauri (Marwa aang).

<doc id="100187" wikidata="Q1191622" url="?curid=100187" title="Special Area of Conservation">
<text>A special area of conservation (SAC) is defined in the European Union&#x27;s Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), also known as the &quot;Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora&quot;. They are to protect the 220 habitats and approximately 1,000 species listed in annex I and II of the directive which are considered to be of European interest following criteria given in the directive. They must be chosen from the sites of Community importance by the member states and designated SAC by an act assuring the conservation measures of the natural habitat.

SACs complement special protection areas and together form a network of protected sites across the European Union called Natura 2000. This, in turn, is part of the Emerald network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest (ASCIs) under the Berne Convention.

==Assessment methodology in the United Kingdom==
Prior to being designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), sites have been assessed under a two-stage process set out by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. The value of the proposed site is considered in relation to the whole national resource of each habitat type and of each species.

===Stage one===

Firstly, assessment of the relative importance of sites containing examples of the individual habitat types. Four criteria are used:
* the degree of representativity;
* the area;
* the degree of conservation of habitat structure and functions;
* restoration possibilities and a global assessment of conservation value (i.e. an overall assessment).

Secondly, species assessment evaluates population size and density, the degree of conservation of the features of the habitat that are important for the species and restoration possibilities, the degree of isolation of the population in relation to the species&#x27; natural range and a global assessment of conservation value.

===Stage two===

This stage is often informally referred to as &#x27;moderation&#x27;. The criteria used in Stage 2 are intended to be used to assess the sites at the level of the nine biogeographical regions and the EU as a whole. The Stage 2 criteria may be summarised as:
*relative value of the site at national level;
*relationship of the site to migration routes or its role as part of an ecosystem on both sides of one or more Community frontiers;
*total area of the site;
*number of habitat types and species present;
*global ecological value of the site at the level of the biogeographical region and/or EU as a whole.

<text>[[Shri|The Sanskrit letter in the [[Devanagari]] script]]

Shri (; , ) is a Sanskrit term denoting resplendence, wealth and prosperity, primarily used as an honorific.

The word is widely used in South and Southeast Asian languages such as Assamese, Meitei (Manipuri), Marathi, Malay (including Indonesian and Malaysian), Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, Sinhala, Thai, Tamil, Telugu, Odia, Assamese, Punjabi, Hindi, Bengali, Nepali, Malayalam, Kannada, Sanskrit, Pali, Khmer, and also among Philippine languages. It is usually transliterated as &quot;Sri&quot;, &quot;Sree&quot;, &quot;Shri&quot;, &quot;Shiri&quot;, &quot;Shree&quot;, &quot;Si&quot;, or &quot;Seri&quot; based on the local convention for transliteration. In Tamil it evolved to Tiru.

The term is used in Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia as a polite form of address equivalent to the English &quot;Mr.&quot; in written and spoken language.

&quot;Shri&quot; is also used as a title of veneration for deities or as honorific title for individuals.

Shri is also an epithet for Hindu goddess - Lakshmi while a &quot;yantra&quot; or a mystical diagram is popularly used to worship her is called Shri Yantra.

==Etymology==

Monier-Williams Dictionary gives the meaning of the root verb as &quot;to cook, boil, to burn, diffuse light&quot;, but as a feminine abstract noun, it has received a general meaning of &quot;grace, splendour, beauty; wealth, affluence, prosperity&quot;.

The word may also be used as an adjective in Sanskrit, which is the origin of the modern use of shri as a title. From the noun, is derived the Sanskrit adjective &quot;śrīmat&quot; (śrimān in the masculine nominative singular, śrīmatī in the feminine), by adding the suffix indicating possession, literally &quot;radiance-having&quot; (person, god, etc.). This is used in modern vernacular as form of address &quot;Shrimati&quot; (abbreviated Smt) for married women, while &quot;Sushri&quot;, (with &quot;su&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, added to the beginning), can be used for women in general (regardless of marital status).

=== Spelling and pronunciation ===
In Devanagari script for Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi and other languages, the word is combination of three sounds: (), () and (, long &quot;i&quot;). There are two conventions in India to transliterate the consonant (ISO: ) to English: some use &quot;s&quot; (which in narrower transcription represents only ) as in &quot;Sri Lanka&quot; and &quot;Srinagar&quot;, while others use &quot;sh&quot; as in &quot;Shimla&quot; and &quot;Shimoga&quot;. Similarly, (; ) is also transliterated to English in two different ways as &quot;ri&quot; and &quot;ree&quot;, although the latter is non-standard in Hindi. Hence this word may be rendered in English as Shri (the standard spelling), Shree, Sri or Sree; Some other transliterations used are Shri, Shiri, Shrii. Whatever the transliteration may be, its pronunciation remains the same.

Sanskrit is written in many other Indian scripts as well, each of which has its own equivalents of these Devanāgari letters; the Sanskrit pronunciation remains the same regardless of script.

==Usage==
&quot;Shri&quot; is a polite form of address equivalent to the English &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot;.

&quot;Shri&quot; is also frequently used as an epithet of some Hindu gods, in which case it is often translated into English as &quot;Holy&quot;. Also, in language and general usage, &quot;Shri&quot;, if used by itself and not followed by any name, refers to the supreme consciousness, i.e. god.

&quot;Shri&quot;, also rendered &quot;Sridevi&quot;, is an epithet of Lakshmi. The Vedas speak of Shri as a goddess, who personified ten qualities coveted by other divine beings: food, royalty, holiness, kingdom, fortune, sovereignty, nobility, power, righteousness, and beauty. The Vedic &quot;Shri&quot; is believed to have identified with later conceptions of Lakshmi, as the embodiment of royalty and dignity.

==Other current usage==
There is a common practice of writing &quot;Shri&quot; as the first word centralised in line at the beginning of a document.

Another usage is as an emphatic compound (which can be used several times: &quot;shri shri&quot;, or &quot;shri shri shri&quot;, etc.) in princely styles, notably in Darbar Shri, Desai Shri, and Thakur Shri or Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, the founder of the social and spiritual movement Ananda Marga (the Path of Bliss).

The honorific can also be applied to objects and concepts that are widely respected, such as the Sikh religious text, the Shri Guru Granth Sahib. Similarly, when the Ramlila tradition of reenacting the Ramayana is referred to as an institution, the term Shri Ramlila is frequently used.

A common Sikh greeting is “&quot;Sat Shri Akaal&quot; (Gurmukhi: ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ)”, meaning “Truth is divine and eternal”. Shri here is used to denote divinity or godliness.

===Indian music===
The use of the term is common in the names of ragas (musical motifs), either as a prefix or postfix. Some examples are Shree, Bhagyashree, Dhanashree, Jayashree, Subhashree, Itishree, Jiteshree, and Shree ranjani.

<text>Lakshmi (; , , sometimes spelled Laxmi, ), also known as Shri (, , ), is one of the principal goddesses in Hinduism, revered as the goddess of wealth, fortune, prosperity, beauty, fertility, royal power, and abundance. She along with Parvati and Sarasvati, form the trinity of goddesses called the Tridevi.

Lakshmi has been a central figure in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist times (1500 to 500 BCE) and remains one of the most widely worshipped goddesses in the Hindu pantheon. Although she does not appear in the earliest Vedic literature, the personification of the term &quot;shri&quot;—auspiciousness, glory, and high rank, often associated with kingship—eventually led to the development of Sri-Lakshmi as a goddess in later Vedic texts, particularly the &quot;Shri Suktam&quot;. Her importance grew significantly during the late epic period (around 400 CE), when she became particularly associated with the preserver god Vishnu as his consort. In this role, Lakshmi is seen as the ideal Hindu wife, exemplifying loyalty and devotion to her husband. Whenever Vishnu descended on the earth as an avatar, Lakshmi accompanied him as consort, for example, as Sita and Radha or Rukmini as consorts of Vishnu&#x27;s avatars Rama and Krishna, respectively.

Lakshmi holds a prominent place in the Vishnu-centric sect of Vaishnavism, where she is not only regarded as the consort of Vishnu, the Supreme Being, but also as his divine energy (&quot;shakti&quot;). she is also the Supreme Goddess in the sect and assists Vishnu to create, protect, and transform the universe. She is an especially prominent figure in Sri Vaishnavism tradition, in which devotion to Lakshmi is deemed to be crucial to reach Vishnu. Within the goddess-oriented Shaktism, Lakshmi is venerated as the prosperity aspect of the Supreme goddess. The eight prominent manifestations of Lakshmi, the Ashtalakshmi, symbolise the eight sources of wealth.

Lakshmi is depicted in Indian art as an elegantly dressed, prosperity-showering golden-coloured woman standing or sitting in the padmasana position upon a lotus throne, while holding a lotus in her hand, symbolising fortune, self-knowledge, and spiritual liberation. Her iconography shows her with four hands, which represent the four aspects of human life important to Hindu culture: &quot;dharma&quot;, &quot;kama&quot;, &quot;artha&quot;, and &quot;moksha&quot;. She is often accompanied by two elephants, as seen in the Gaja-Lakshmi images, symbolising both fertility and royal authority. The Gupta period sculpture and coins only associate lions with Lakshmi, often flanking her on either side. 

Archaeological discoveries and ancient coinage suggest a recognition and reverence for Lakshmi by the first millennium BCE. Iconography and statues of Lakshmi have also been found in Hindu temples throughout Southeast Asia, estimated to be from the second half of the first millennium CE. The day of Lakshmi Puja during Navaratri, and the festivals of Deepavali and Sharad Purnima (Kojagiri Purnima) are celebrated in her honour.

== Etymology and epithets ==

Lakshmi in Sanskrit is derived from the root word &quot;lakṣ&quot; () and &quot;lakṣa&quot; (), meaning &#x27;to perceive, observe, know, understand&#x27; and &#x27;goal, aim, objective&#x27;, respectively. These roots give Lakshmi the symbolism: &quot;know&quot; and &quot;understand&quot; your goal. A related term is &quot;lakṣaṇa&quot;, which means &#x27;sign, target, aim, symbol, attribute, quality, lucky mark, auspicious opportunity&quot;&#x27;.&quot;
Lakshmi has numerous epithets and numerous ancient Stotram and Sutras of Hinduism recite her various names: such as &quot;Sri&quot; (Radiance, eminence, splendor, wealth), &quot; Padmā&quot; (she who is mounted upon or dwelling in a lotus or She of the lotus), &quot; Kamalā&quot; or Kamalatmika (She of the lotus), &quot;Padmapriyā&quot; (Lotus-lover), &quot;Padmamālādhāra Devī&quot; (Goddess bearing a garland of lotuses), &quot; Padmamukhī&quot; (Lotus-faced-she whose face is as like as a lotus), &quot; Padmākṣī&quot;: (Lotus-eyed - she whose eyes are as beautiful as a lotus), &quot;Padmahasta&quot;: (Lotus-hand - she whose hand is holding [a] lotus[es]), &quot; Padmasundarī&quot; (She who is as beautiful as a lotus), &quot;Padmavati&quot; (She who was born from a lotus),&quot; Śrījā&quot; (Jatika of Sri), &quot;Narayani&quot; (belonging to Narayana or the wife of Narayana), &quot;Vaishnavi&quot; (worshipper of Vishnu or the power of Vishnu), &quot; Viṣṇupriyā&quot; (who is the beloved of Vishnu), &quot;Nandika&quot; (the one who gives pleasure). Shaktas also consider Lalita, who is praised with 1,000 names in the Lalita Sahasranama, as Lakshmi.

Lakshmi Sahasranama of Skanda Purana praises Lakshmi as &quot;Mahadevi&quot; (she who is the great goddess), &quot;Mahamaya&quot; (she who is a great illusion), &quot;Karaveera Nivasini&quot; (The Goddess Who lives in Karaveera/Kolhapur) and &quot;Maha Astha Dasa Pithagne&quot; (she who has 18 great Shakta pithas). She is also praised as &quot;Mahalakshmi&quot; (she who is great Lakshmi), &quot;Mahakali&quot; (she who is great Kali), and &quot;Mahasaraswati&quot; (she who is great Saraswati) who are the primary deities in Devi Mahatmya. The other prominent names included in this text are, &quot;Bhuvaneshvari (she who is the Queen or ruler of the Universe), &quot;Katyayani&quot; (she who is the daughter of sage Katyayana), &quot;Kaushiki&quot; (Shakti that came out of the sheath (or Kosha) of Parvati), &quot;Brahmani&quot; (She who is the power of Brahma), &quot;Kamakshi&quot; (she who fulfils desires by her eyes), &quot;Chandi&quot; (she who killed Mahishasura), &quot;Chamunda&quot; (She who killed Chanda and Munda), &quot;Madhu Kaidabha Bhanjini&quot; (she who killed Madhu and Kaidabha), &quot;Durga&quot; (she who killed Durgamasura), &quot;Maheshvari&quot; (she who is the power of Maheshvara), &quot;Varahi&quot; (she who is the power of Varaha, a form of Vishnu), &quot;Narasimhi&quot; (she who is the power of Narasimha, a form of Vishnu), &quot;Srividyaa&quot; (she who is Sri Vidya), &quot;Sri Manthra Raja Rajini&quot; (the queen of Sri Vidya), &quot;Shadadharadhi devata&quot; (she who is the goddess of the six chakras). &quot;Dutch author Dirk van der Plas says, &quot;In Lakshmi Tantra, a text of Visnuite signature, the name Mahamaya is connected with third or destructive of Goddess&#x27; three partial functions, while in supreme form she is identified with Lakshmi&quot;&quot;.&quot;

== Iconography and symbolism ==


Lakshmi is a member of the Tridevi, the triad of great goddesses. She represents the Rajas &quot;guna&quot;, and the Iccha-shakti. The image, icons, and sculptures of Lakshmi are represented with symbolism. Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective. Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism: &quot;dharma&quot; (pursuit of ethical, moral life), &quot;artha&quot; (pursuit of wealth, means of life), &quot;kama&quot; (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment), and &quot;moksha&quot; (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).

In Lakshmi&#x27;s iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolizes knowledge, self-realization, and liberation in the Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness, and &quot;karma&quot; (&#x27;work, deed&#x27;) in the Tantra (Sahasrara) context. The lotus, a flower that blooms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which it grows. It is a reminder that good and prosperity can bloom and not be affected by evil in one&#x27;s surroundings.

Below, behind, or on the sides, Lakshmi is very often shown with one or two elephants, known as Gajalakshmi, and occasionally with an owl. Elephants symbolise work, activity, and strength, as well as water, rain, and fertility for abundant prosperity. The owl signifies the patient striving to observe, see, and discover knowledge, particularly when surrounded by darkness. As a bird reputedly blinded by daylight, the owl also serves as a symbolic reminder to refrain from blindness and greed after knowledge and wealth have been acquired. 

According to historian D. D. Kosambi, most of the Imperial Gupta kings were Vaishnavas and held the goddess Lakshmi in the highest esteem. Goddess Lakshmi is Simhavahini (mount as lion) on most of the coins during their rule. Coins during the rule of Prakashadiya, a Gupta ruler, contain the Garudadhvaja on the obverse and Lakshmi on the reverse. 

The Gupta period sculpture only used to associate lions with Lakshmi, but was later attributed to Durga or a combined form of both goddesses. Lions were a &#x27;vahana&#x27; of Lakshmi, Lions are also associated with &quot;Veera Lakshmi&quot;, who is one of the Ashtalakshmi. Historian B. C. Bhattacharya says, &quot;An image of Gajalakshmi is found with two lions — one on either side of her. Two elephants are also shown near her head and by this we can say that Lion is also the vahana of Lakshmi along with Garuda&quot;.

In some representations, wealth either symbolically pours out from one of her hands or she simply holds a jar of money. This symbolism has a dual meaning: wealth manifested through Lakshmi means both materials as well as spiritual wealth. Her face and open hands are in a mudra that signifies compassion, giving or &quot;dāna&quot; (&#x27;charity&#x27;).

Lakshmi typically wears a red dress embroidered with golden threads, which symbolizes fortune and wealth. She, goddess of wealth and prosperity, is often represented with her husband Vishnu, the god who maintains human life filled with justice and peace. This symbolism implies wealth and prosperity are coupled with the maintenance of life, justice, and peace. When Lakshmi and Vishnu appear together in images and statues, she is significantly smaller, which is often used to portray her devotional status as a wife. A frequently depicted scene of the pair illustrates Lakshmi massaging Vishnu&#x27;s feet.

Alternatively, Lakshmi Sahasranama of Skanda Purana, Lakshmi Tantra, and Markandeya Purana describe Lakshmi as having eighteen hands and is described as holding rosary, axe, mace, arrow, thunderbolt, lotus, pitcher, rod, sakti, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup, trident, noose, and the discus in her eighteen hands, and as sitting on Garuda, a lion, or a tiger. According to the Lakshmi Tantra, the goddess Lakshmi, in her ultimate form of Mahasri, has four arms of a golden complexion, and holds a citron, a club, a shield, and a vessel containing amrita. In the Skanda Purana and the &quot;Venkatachala Mahatmayam&quot;, Sri, or Lakshmi, is praised as the mother of Brahma.

In Japan, where Lakshmi is known as &quot;Kisshōten&quot;, she is commonly depicted with the Nyoihōju gem (如意宝珠) in her hand.

==Literature==
===Vedas and Brahmanas===
The meaning and significance of Lakshmi evolved in ancient Sanskrit texts. Lakshmi is mentioned once in Rigveda, in which the name is used to mean &#x27;kindred mark, sign of auspicious fortune&quot;&#x27;.&quot;
In Atharva Veda, transcribed about 1000 BCE, Lakshmi evolves into a complex concept with plural manifestations. Book 7, Chapter 115 of Atharva Veda describes the plurality, asserting that a hundred Lakshmis are born with the body of a mortal at birth, some good, &quot;Punya&quot; (&#x27;virtuous&#x27;) and auspicious, while others bad, &quot;paapi&quot; (&#x27;evil&#x27;) and unfortunate. The good are welcomed, while the bad are urged to leave. The concept and spirit of Lakshmi and her association with fortune and the good is significant enough that Atharva Veda mentions it in multiple books: for example, in Book 12, Chapter 5 as &quot;Punya Lakshmi&quot;. In some chapters of Atharva Veda, Lakshmi connotes the good, an auspicious sign, good luck, good fortune, prosperity, success, and happiness.

Later, Lakshmi is referred to as the goddess of fortune, identified with Sri and regarded as the wife of &quot;&quot; (). For example, in Shatapatha Brahmana, variously estimated to be composed between 800 BCE and 300 BCE, Sri (Lakshmi) is part of one of many theories, in ancient India, about the creation of the universe. In Book 9 of Shatapatha Brahmana, Sri emerges from Prajapati, after his intense meditation on the creation of life and nature of the universe. Sri is described as a resplendent and trembling woman at her birth with immense energy and powers. The gods are bewitched, desire her, and immediately become covetous of her. The gods approach Prajapati and request permission to kill her and then take her powers, talents, and gifts. Prajapati refuses, tells the gods that men should not kill women and that they can seek her gifts without violence. The gods then approach Lakshmi. Agni gets food, Soma gets kingly authority, Varuna gets imperial authority, Mitra acquires martial energy, Indra gets force, Brihaspati gets priestly authority, Savitri acquires dominion, Pushan gets splendour, Saraswati takes nourishment and Tvashtri gets forms. The hymns of Shatapatha Brahmana thus describe Sri as a goddess born with and personifying a diverse range of talents and powers.

According to another legend, she emerges during the creation of universe, floating over the water on the expanded petals of a lotus flower; she is also variously regarded as wife of Dharma, mother of Kāma, sister or mother of and , wife of Dattatreya, one of the nine Shaktis of , a manifestation of as identified with in Bharatasrama and as Sita, wife of Rama.

===Epics===
In the Epics of Hinduism, such as in Mahabharata, Lakshmi personifies wealth, riches, happiness, loveliness, grace, charm, and splendor. In another Hindu legend about the creation of the universe as described in Ramayana, Lakshmi springs with other precious things from the foam of the ocean of milk when it is churned by the gods and demons for the recovery of . She appeared with a lotus in her hand and so she is also called Padmā.

Sita, the female protagonist of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and her husband, the god-king Rama are considered as avatars of Lakshmi and Vishnu, respectively. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Draupadi is described as a partial incarnation of Sri (Lakshmi).
However, other chapter of the epic states that Lakshmi took the incarnation of Rukmini, the chief-wife of the Hindu god Krishna.

===Upanishads===
Shakta Upanishads are dedicated to the Tridevi of goddesses—Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati. Saubhagyalakshmi Upanishad describes the qualities, characteristics, and powers of Lakshmi. In the second part of the Upanishad, the emphasis shifts to the use of yoga and transcendence from material craving to achieve spiritual knowledge and self-realization, the true wealth. Saubhagya-Lakshmi Upanishad synonymously uses Sri to describe Lakshmi.

===Stotram and sutras===
Numerous ancient Stotram and Sutras of Hinduism recite hymns dedicated to Lakshmi. She is a major goddess in Puranas and Itihasa of Hinduism. In ancient scriptures of India, all women are declared to be embodiments of Lakshmi. For example:


Ancient prayers dedicated to Lakshmi seek both material and spiritual wealth in prayers.

===Puranas===
Lakshmi features prominently in Puranas of Hinduism. Vishnu Purana, in particular, dedicates many sections to her and also refers to her as Sri. J. A. B. van Buitenen translates passages describing Lakshmi in Vishnu Purana:Sri, loyal to Vishnu, is the mother of the world. Vishnu is the meaning, Sri is the speech. She is the conduct, he the behavior. Vishnu is knowledge, she the insight. He is dharma, she the virtuous action. She is the earth, the earth&#x27;s upholder. She is contentment, he the satisfaction. She wishes, he is the desire. Sri is the sky, Vishnu the Self of everything. He is the Sun, she the light of the Sun. He is the ocean, she is the shore.

===Subhasita, genomic and didactic literature===

Lakshmi, along with Parvati and Saraswati, is a subject of extensive Subhashita, genomic and didactic literature of India. Composed in the 1st millennium BCE through the 16th century CE, they are short poems, proverbs, couplets, or aphorisms in Sanskrit written in a precise meter. They sometimes take the form of a dialogue between Lakshmi and Vishnu or highlight the spiritual message in Vedas and ethical maxims from Hindu Epics through Lakshmi. An example Subhashita is &quot;Puranartha Samgraha&quot;, compiled by Vekataraya in South India, where Lakshmi and Vishnu discuss &quot;niti&quot; (&#x27;right, moral conduct&#x27;) and &quot;rajaniti&quot; (&#x27;statesmanship&#x27; or &#x27;right governance&#x27;)—covering in 30 chapters and ethical and moral questions about personal, social and political life.

==Manifestations and aspects==

Inside temples, Lakshmi is often shown together with Vishnu. In certain parts of India, Lakshmi plays a special role as the mediator between her husband Vishnu and his worldly devotees. When asking Vishnu for grace or forgiveness, the devotees often approach him through the intermediary presence of Lakshmi. She is also the personification of spiritual fulfillment. Lakshmi embodies the spiritual world, also known as Vaikuntha, the abode of Lakshmi and Vishnu (collectively called Lakshmi Narayana). Lakshmi is the embodiment of the creative energy of Vishnu, and primordial Prakriti who creates the universe.
According to &quot;Garuda Purana&quot;, Lakshmi is considered as &quot;Prakriti&quot; (Mahalakshmi) and is identified with three forms Sri, Bhu and Durga. The three forms consist of Satva (&#x27;goodness&#x27;), rajas, and tamas (&#x27;darkness&#x27;) gunas, and assists Vishnu (Purusha) in creation, preservation and destruction of the entire universe. Durga&#x27;s form represents the power to fight, conquer and punish the demons and anti-gods.
In the &quot;Lakshmi Tantra&quot; and Lakshmi Sahasranama of Skanda Purana, Lakshmi is given the status of the primordial goddess. According to these texts, Durga and the other forms, such as Mahalakshmi, Mahakali and Mahasaraswati and all the Shaktis that came out of all gods such as Matrikas and Mahavidya, are all various forms of Goddess Lakshmi. In Lakshmi Tantra, Lakshmi tells Indra that she got the name Durga after killing an asura named Durgama. Indologists and authors Chitralekha Singh and Prem Nath says, &quot;Narada Purana describes the powerful forms of Lakshmi as Durga, Mahakali, Bhadrakali, Chandi, Maheshwari, Mahalakshmi, Vaishnavi and Andreye&quot;.

Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Parvati are typically conceptualized as distinct in most of India, but in states such as West Bengal and Odisha, they are regionally believed to be forms of Durga. In Hindu Bengali culture, Lakshmi, along with Saraswati, are seen as the daughters of Durga. They are worshipped during Durga Puja.

In South India, Lakshmi is seen in two forms, Sridevi and Bhudevi, both at the sides of Venkateshwara, a form of Vishnu. Bhudevi is the representation and totality of the material world or energy, called the &quot;Apara Prakriti&quot;, or Mother Earth; Sridevi is the spiritual world or energy called the &quot;Prakriti&quot;. According to Lakshmi Tantra, Nila Devi, one of the manifestations or incarnations of Lakshmi is the third wife of Vishnu. Each goddess of the triad is mentioned in Śrī Sūkta, Bhu Sūkta and Nila Sūkta, respectively. This threefold goddess can be found, for example, in Sri Bhu Neela Sahita Temple near Dwaraka Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh, and in Adinath Swami Temple in Tamil Nadu. In many parts of the region, Andal is considered as an incarnation of Lakshmi.

Ashta Lakshmi (Sanskrit: ) is a group of eight secondary manifestations of Lakshmi. The Ashta Lakshmi presides over eight sources of wealth and thus represents the eight powers of Shri Lakshmi. Temples dedicated to Ashta Lakshmi are found in Tamil Nadu, such as Ashtalakshmi Kovil near Chennai and many other states of India.

==Creation and legends==

&quot;Devas&quot; (gods) and &quot;asuras&quot; (demons) were both mortal at one time in Hinduism. Amrita, the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning Kshira Sagara (&#x27;Ocean of Milk&#x27;). The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshira Sagara with Mount Mandhara. The Samudra Manthana commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. Vishnu incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise, and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. Vasuki, the great venom-spewing serpent-god, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lakshmi. In some versions, she is said to be the daughter of the sea god since she emerged from the sea.

In Garuda Purana, Linga Purana and Padma Purana, Lakshmi is said to have been born as the daughter of the divine sage Bhrigu and his wife Khyati and was named &quot;Bhargavi&quot;. According to Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the devas and asuras churned the cosmic Kshira Sagara. Lakshmi came out of the ocean, bearing a lotus, along with the divine cow Kamadhenu, Varuni, the Parijat tree, the Apsaras, Chandra (the moon), and Dhanvantari with Amrita (&#x27;nectar of immortality&#x27;). When she appeared, she had a choice to go to the Devas or the Asuras. She chose the Devas&#x27; side and among thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu. Thereafter, in all three worlds, the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated.

==Worship and festivals==
===Festivals===
Many Hindus worship Lakshmi on Deepavali (Diwali), the festival of lights. It is celebrated in autumn, typically October or November every year. The festival spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil and hope over despair.
Before the night of Deepavali, people clean, renovate and decorate their homes and offices. On the night of Deepavali, Hindus dress up in new clothes or their best outfits, light up diyas (lamps and candles) inside and outside their home, and participate in family &quot;puja&quot; (prayers) typically to Lakshmi. After the Lakshmi Puja, fireworks follow, then a family feast including &quot;mithai&quot; (sweets), and an exchange of gifts between family members and close friends. Deepavali also marks a major shopping period, since Lakshmi connotes auspiciousness, wealth and prosperity. This festival dedicated to Lakshmi is considered by Hindus to be one of the most important and joyous festivals of the year.

A very sacred day for the worship of Goddess Lakshmi falls on Chaitra Shukla Panchami, also called, &quot;Lakshmi Panchami&quot;, Shri Panchami, Kalpadi and Shri Vrata. As this worship is in the first week of the Hindu new year, by Hindu calendar, it is considered very auspicious. Varalakshmi Vratam is celebrated by married Hindu women to pray for the well-being of their husbands.

Gaja Lakshmi Puja is another autumn festival celebrated on Sharad Purnima in many parts of India on the full-moon day in the month of Ashvin (October). Sharad Purnima, also called Kojaagari Purnima or Kuanr Purnima, is a harvest festival marking the end of monsoon season. There is a traditional celebration of the moon called the &quot;Kaumudi celebration&quot;, Kaumudi meaning moonlight. On Sharad Purnima night, goddess Lakshmi is thanked and worshipped for the harvests. Vaibhav Lakshmi Vrata is observed on Friday for prosperity.

===Hymns===

==Archaeology==

A representation of the goddess as Gaja Lakshmi or Lakshmi flanked by two elephants spraying her with water, is one of the most frequently found in archaeological sites. An ancient sculpture of Gaja Lakshmi (from Sonkh site at Mathura) dates to the pre-Kushan Empire era. Atranjikhera site in modern Uttar Pradesh has yielded terracotta plaque with images of Lakshmi dating to the 2nd century BCE. Other archaeological sites with ancient Lakshmi terracotta figurines from the 3rd century BCE include Vaisali, Sravasti, Kausambi, Campa, and Candraketugadh.

The goddess Lakshmi is frequently found in ancient coins of various Hindu kingdoms from Afghanistan to India. Gaja Lakshmi has been found on coins of Scytho-Parthian kings Azes II and Azilises; she also appears on Shunga Empire king Jyesthamitra era coins, both dating to 1st millennium BCE. Coins from 1st through 4th century CE found in various locations in India such as Ayodhya, Mathura, Ujjain, Sanchi, Bodh Gaya, Kanauj, all feature Lakshmi. Similarly, ancient Greco-Indian gems and seals with images of Lakshmi have been found, estimated to be from 1st-millennium BCE.

A 1400-year-old rare granite sculpture of Lakshmi has been recovered at the Waghama village along Jehlum in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Pompeii Lakshmi, a statuette supposedly thought to be of Lakshmi found in Pompeii, Italy, dates to before the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE.

==Outside Hinduism==
===Jainism===

Lakshmi is also an important deity in Jainism and found in Jain temples. Some Jain temples also depict Sri Lakshmi as a goddess of &quot;artha&quot; (&#x27;wealth&#x27;) and &quot;kama&quot; (&#x27;pleasure&#x27;). For example, she is exhibited with Vishnu in Parshvanatha Jain Temple at the Khajuraho Monuments of Madhya Pradesh, where she is shown pressed against Vishnu&#x27;s chest, while Vishnu cups a breast in his palm. The presence of Vishnu-Lakshmi iconography in a Jain temple built near the Hindu temples of Khajuraho, suggests the sharing and acceptance of Lakshmi across a spectrum of Indian religions. This commonality is reflected in the praise of Lakshmi found in the Jain text Kalpa Sūtra.

===Buddhism===

In Buddhism, Lakshmi has been viewed as a goddess of abundance and fortune, and is represented on the oldest surviving stupas and cave temples of Buddhism. In Buddhist sects of Tibet, Nepal, and Southeast Asia, Vasudhara mirrors the characteristics and attributes of the Hindu Goddess, with minor iconographic differences.

In Chinese Buddhism, Lakshmi is referred to as either Gōngdétiān (功德天, lit &quot;Meritorious god&quot; ) or Jíxiáng Tiānnǚ (吉祥天女, lit &quot;Auspicious goddess&quot;) and is the goddess of fortune and prosperity. She is regarded as the sister of Píshāméntiān (毗沙門天), or Vaiśravaṇa, one of the Four Heavenly Kings. She is also regarded as one of the twenty-four protective deities, and her image is frequently enshrined in the Mahavira Hall of most Chinese Buddhist monasteries together with the other deities. Her mantra, the Sri Devi Dharani (Chinese: 大吉祥天女咒; pinyin: Dà Jíxiáng Tiānnǚ Zhòu) is classified as one of the Ten Small Mantras (Chinese: 十小咒; pinyin: Shí xiǎo zhòu), which are a collection of dharanis that are commonly recited in Chinese Buddhist temples during morning liturgical services.

The Dharani is as follows:Namo buddhāya, Namo dharmāya, Namah samghāya, Namah Śrī Mahādevīye, Tadyathā Om paripūraņa cāre samanta darśane. Mahā vihāra gate samanta vidhamane. Mahā kārya pratişţhāpane, sarvārtha sādhane, supratipūri ayatna dharmatā. Mahā vikurvite, mahā maitrī upasamhite, mahārşi susamgŗhīte samantārtha anupālane svāhā.In Japanese Buddhism, Lakshmi is known as Kishijoten () and is also the goddess of fortune and prosperity. Like in China, Kishijoten is considered the sister of Bishamon (, also known as Tamon or Bishamon-ten), who protects human life, fights evil, and brings good fortune. In ancient and medieval Japan, Kishijoten was the goddess worshiped for luck and prosperity, particularly on behalf of children. Kishijoten was also the guardian goddess of Geishas.

In Tibetan Buddhism, Lakshmi is an important deity, especially in the Gelug School. She has both peaceful and wrathful forms; the latter form is known as Palden Lhamo, Shri Devi Dudsol Dokam, or Kamadhatvishvari, and is the principal female protector of (Gelug) Tibetan Buddhism and of Lhasa, Tibet.

While Lakshmi and Vaiśravaṇa are found in ancient Chinese and Japanese Buddhist literature, their roots have been traced to deities in Hinduism.

Lakshmi is closely linked to Dewi Sri, who is worshipped in Bali as the goddess of fertility and agriculture.

<text>Durga (, ) is a major Hindu goddess, worshipped as a principal aspect of the mother goddess Mahadevi. She is associated with protection, strength, motherhood, destruction, and wars.

Durga&#x27;s legend centres around combating evils and demonic forces that threaten peace, prosperity, and dharma, representing the power of good over evil. Durga is believed to unleash her divine wrath against the wicked for the liberation of the oppressed, and entails destruction to empower creation. Durga is seen as a motherly figure and often depicted as a beautiful woman, riding a lion or tiger, with many arms each carrying a weapon and often defeating demons. She is widely worshipped by the followers of the goddess-centric sect, Shaktism, and has importance in other denominations like Shaivism and Vaishnavism.

The most important texts of Shaktism, Devi Mahatmya and Devi Bhagavata Purana, revere Devi (the Goddess) as the primordial creator of the universe and the Brahman (ultimate truth and reality). She is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism. She is also considered to be the younger sister of Vishnu according to Bhagavata purana.

Durga has a significant following all over Nepal, India, Bangladesh and many other countries. She is mostly worshipped after spring and autumn harvests, especially during the festivals of Durga Puja, Durga Ashtami, Vijayadashami, Deepavali, and Navaratri.

==Etymology and nomenclature==

The word &quot;Durga&quot; (दुर्गा) literally means &quot;impassable&quot;, &quot;invincible, unassailable&quot;. It is related to the word &quot;Durg&quot; (दुर्ग) which means &quot;fortress, something difficult to defeat or pass&quot;. According to Monier Monier-Williams, &quot;Durga&quot; is derived from the roots &quot;dur&quot; (difficult) and &quot;gam&quot; (pass, go through). According to Indologist Alain Daniélou, Durga means &quot;beyond defeat&quot;.

The word &quot;Durga&quot; and related terms appear in the Vedic literature, such as in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;. A deity named &quot;Durge&quot; appears in section 10.1.7 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. While the Vedic literature uses the word &quot;Durga&quot;, the description therein lacks the legendary details about her that is found in later Hindu literature.

The word is also found in ancient post-Vedic Sanskrit texts such as in section 2.451 of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and section 4.27.16 of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. These usages are in different contexts. For example, &quot;Durg&quot; is the name of an Asura who had become invincible to gods, and &quot;Durga&quot; is the goddess who intervenes and slays him. &quot;Durga&quot; and its derivatives are found in sections 4.1.99 and 6.3.63 of the &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot; by Pāṇini, the ancient Sanskrit grammarian, and in the commentary of Nirukta by Yaska.

=== Epithets ===
Durga is commonly known as &quot;Mahishasura-mardini&quot; for slaying the half-buffalo demon Mahishasura. She is also known as &quot;Vindhyavasini&quot; (she who dwells in the Vindhya Mountains). Her other epithets include &quot;Mahamoha&quot; (great delusion), &quot;Mahasuri&quot; (the great demoness), &quot;Tamasi&quot; (the great night, the night of delusion).

There are many epithets for Durga in Shaktism and her nine appellations are (Navadurga): Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayini, Kalaratri, Mahagauri and Siddhidatri. A list of 108 names of the goddess is recited in order to worship her and is popularly known as the &quot;Ashtottarshat Namavali of Goddess Durga&quot;.

Other meanings may include: &quot;the one who cannot be accessed easily&quot;, &quot;the undefeatable goddess&quot;.

Durga is also known as &quot;Durgati Nashini,&quot; meaning one who eliminates suffering.

Her other names include Chandika, Sharada, Ambika, Vaishnavi etc.

== History and texts ==
Evidence of Durga-like images can probably be traced back to the Indus Valley civilisation. According to Asko Parpola, a cylindrical seal from Kalibangan shows &quot;a Durgā-like goddess of war, who is associated with the tiger&quot;.

Reverence for Devi, the feminine nature of God, first appears in the 10th Maṇḍala of &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, one of the scriptures of Hinduism. This hymn is also called the Devi Suktam hymn (abridged):

&lt;poem&gt;
I am the Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful, first of those who merit worship.
 Thus gods have established me in many places with many homes to enter and abide in.
Through me alone all eat the food that feeds them, – each man who sees, breathes, hears the word outspoken.
 They know it not, yet I reside in the essence of the Universe. Hear, one and all, the truth as I declare it.
I, verily, myself announce and utter the word that gods and men alike shall welcome.
 I make the man I love exceedingly mighty, make him nourished, a sage, and one who knows Brahman.
I bend the bow for Rudra, that his arrow may strike, and slay the hater of devotion.
 I rouse and order battle for the people, I created Earth and Heaven and reside as their Inner Controller.
On the world&#x27;s summit I bring forth sky the Father: my home is in the waters, in the ocean as Mother.
 Thence I pervade all existing creatures, as their Inner Supreme Self, and manifest them with my body.
I created all worlds at my will, without any higher being, and permeate and dwell within them.
 The eternal and infinite consciousness is I, it is my greatness dwelling in everything.
&lt;/poem&gt;
– Devi Sukta, &quot;Rigveda 10.125.3 – 10.125.8&quot;,

Devi&#x27;s epithets synonymous with Durga appear in Upanishadic literature, such as &quot;Kali&quot; in verse 1.2.4 of the &quot;Mundaka Upanishad&quot; dated to about the 5th century BCE. This single mention describes &quot;Kali&quot; as &quot;terrible yet swift as thought&quot;, very red and smoky coloured manifestation of the divine with a fire-like flickering tongue, before the text begins presenting its thesis that one must seek self-knowledge and the knowledge of the eternal Brahman.

Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Epics period of ancient India, that is the centuries around the start of the common era. Both Yudhisthira and Arjuna characters of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; invoke hymns to &quot;Durga&quot;. She appears in &quot;Harivamsa&quot; in the form of Vishnu&#x27;s eulogy, and in Pradyumna prayer. Various Puranas from the early to late 1st millennium CE dedicate chapters of inconsistent legends associated with &quot;Durga&quot;. Of these, the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; and the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot; are the most significant texts on &quot;Durga&quot;. The Devi Upanishad and other Shakta Upanishads, mostly dated to have been composed in or after the 9th century, present the philosophical and mystical speculations related to &quot;Durga&quot; as &quot;Devi&quot; and other epithets, identifying her to be the same as the Brahman and Atman (self, soul).

In the &quot;Narada Purana&quot;, Durga is associated as a form of Lakshmi. In the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, Lakshmi is considered Prakriti (Mahalakshmi) and is identified with three forms — Sri, Bhu and Durga. In Pancharatra texts such as the &quot;Lakshmi Tantra&quot;, Lakshmi has Durga as one of her forms and acquires the name Durga after killing the demon Durgamasura. These texts identify Durga as Vishnu&#x27;s māyā&quot;.

The &quot;Mahishasura Mardini Stotra&quot; by Adi Shankara was written in her praise.

===Origins===
The historian Ramaprasad Chanda stated in 1916 that Durga evolved over time in the Indian subcontinent. A primitive form of Durga, according to Chanda, was the result of &quot;syncretism of a mountain-goddess worshipped by the dwellers of the Himalaya and the Vindhyas&quot;, a deity of the Abhiras conceptualised as a war-goddess. Durga then transformed into Kali as the personification of the all-destroying time, while aspects of her emerged as the primordial energy (Adya Sakti) integrated into the samsara (cycle of rebirths) concept and this idea was built on the foundation of the Vedic religion, mythology and philosophy. There are total of nine avatars of Goddess Durga in Hinduism.

Epigraphical evidence indicates that regardless of her origins, Durga is an ancient goddess. The 6th-century CE inscriptions in early Siddhamatrika script, such as at the Nagarjuni hill cave during the Maukhari era, already mention the legend of her victory over Mahishasura (buffalo-hybrid demon).

&quot;Durga&quot; as a demon-slaying goddess was likely well established by the time the classic Hindu text called &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; was composed, which scholars variously estimate to between 400 and 600 CE. The &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; and other mythologies describe the nature of demonic forces symbolised by Mahishasura as shape-shifting and adapting in nature, form and strategy to create difficulties and achieve their evil ends, while Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.

==Legends==

The most popular legend associated with the goddess is of her killing of Mahishasura. Mahishasura was a half-buffalo demon who did severe penance in order to please Brahma, the creator. After several years, Brahma, pleased with his devotion, appeared before him. The demon opened his eyes and asked the god for immortality. Brahma refused, stating that all must die one day. Mahishasura then thought for a while and asked a boon that only a woman could be able to kill him. Brahma granted the boon and disappeared. Mahishasura started to torture innocent people. He captured Svarga and was not in any kind of fear, as he thought women to be powerless and weak. The devas were worried and they went to Trimurti. The Trimurti combined their power, and gave a physical form to the sum of their divine energy, Adi Shakti, a warrior woman with many arms. Himavan, the personification of the Himalayas, gifted a lion as her mount. Durga, on her lion, appeared before Mahishasura where the demon took on different forms and attacked the goddess. Each time, Durga would destroy his forms. At last, Durga slew Mahishasura with her trident when he was transforming as a buffalo demon.

According to Vaishnava tradition, Durga is among the various epithets and avatars of Yogamaya, the personification of the illusory power of Vishnu. Vishnu offers Durga the task of transferring the seventh child of Devaki into the womb of Rohini, as well as being born on earth as the infant daughter of Yashoda and Nanda, so that she could be swapped with Krishna. When Kamsa attempted to slay her, she manifested her true form of an eighteen-armed goddess, wearing a garland of lemons. The goddess announced that Kamsa&#x27;s slayer had already been born, before vanishing. Durga is often conceptualised in this role as a sister of Vishnu.

== Attributes and iconography ==
Durga is a warrior goddess, and she is depicted to express her martial skills. Her iconography typically resonates with these attributes, where she rides a lion or a tiger, has between eight and eighteen hands, each holding a weapon to destroy and create. She is often shown in the midst of her war with Mahishasura, the buffalo demon, at the time she victoriously kills the demonic force. Her icon shows her in action, yet her face is calm and serene. In Hindu arts, this tranquil attribute of Durga&#x27;s face is traditionally derived from the belief that she is protective and violent not because of her hatred, egotism or getting pleasure in violence, but because she acts out of necessity, for the love of the good, for liberation of those who depend on her, and a mark of the beginning of soul&#x27;s journey to creative freedom.

Durga traditionally holds the weapons of various male gods of Hindu mythology, which they give her to fight the evil forces because they feel that she is &quot;shakti&quot; (energy, power). These include the &quot;chakra&quot; (divine discus), conch, bow, arrow, sword, javelin, trishula trident, shield, mace, pink Lotus Flower and a noose. These weapons are considered symbolic by Shakta Hindus, representing self-discipline, selfless service to others, self-examination, prayer, devotion, remembering her mantras, cheerfulness and meditation. Durga herself is viewed as the &quot;Self&quot; within and the divine mother of all creation. She has been revered by warriors, blessing their new weapons. Durga iconography has been flexible in the Hindu traditions, where for example some intellectuals place a pen or other writing implements in her hand since they consider their stylus as their weapon.

Archeological discoveries suggest that these iconographic features of Durga became common throughout India by about the 4th century CE, states David Kinsley – a professor of religious studies specialising on Hindu goddesses. In the north wall of a granite cave in Mamallapuram, Tamil Nadu there is a large relief of Durga slaying Mahisasura, carved around 630–674 CE.

Durga iconography in some temples appears as part of &quot;Mahavidyas&quot; or &quot;Saptamatrkas&quot; (seven mothers considered forms of Durga). Her icons in major Hindu temples such as in Varanasi include relief artworks that show scenes from the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;.

In Vaishnavism, Durga and her mount of a lion, is considered one of the three aspects or forms of Goddess Lakshmi, the other two being &quot;Sri&quot; and &quot;Bhu,&quot; in place of Niladevi. According to professor Tracy Pintchman, &quot;When the Lord Vishnu created the gunas of prakriti, there arose Lakshmi in her three forms, &quot;Sri&quot;, &quot;Bhu&quot; and &quot;Durga&quot;. &quot;Sri&quot; consisted of sattva, &quot;Bhu&quot; as rajas and &quot;Durga&quot; as tamas&quot;.

Durga appears in Hindu traditions in numerous forms and names, but ultimately all these are different aspects and manifestations of one goddess. She is imagined to be terrifying and destructive when she has to be, but benevolent and nurturing when she needs to be. While anthropomorphic icons of her, such as those showing her riding a lion and holding weapons, are common, the Hindu traditions use aniconic forms and geometric designs (yantra) to remember and revere what she symbolises.

==Worship and festivals==
Durga is worshipped in Hindu temples across India and Nepal by Shakta Hindus.

The Vedic Texts concluded Durga alone to be the Supreme and the Absolute facet of Brahman, as stated in the Devi-Atharvashirshaयस्याः परतरं नास्ति सैषा दुर्गा प्रकीर्तिता ॥२४॥

She who is renowned by the name &quot;Durga&quot; is the being superior to whom, no one exists.

– Devi Atharvashirhsa Upanishad, 24. Her temples, worship and festivals are particularly popular in eastern and northeastern parts of Indian subcontinent during Durga puja, Dashain and Navaratri.

===Durga puja===
As per the Markandeya Purana, Durga Puja can be performed either for 9 days or 4 days (last four in sequence). The four-day-long Durga Puja is a major annual festival in Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand and Bihar. It is scheduled per the Hindu luni-solar calendar in the month of &quot;Ashvina&quot;, and typically falls in September or October. Since it is celebrated during Sharad (literally, season of weeds), it is called as Sharadiya Durga Puja or Akal-Bodhan to differentiate it from the one celebrated originally in spring. The festival is celebrated by communities by making special colourful images of Durga out of clay, recitations of &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; text, prayers and revelry for nine days, after which it is taken out in procession with singing and dancing, then immersed in water. The Durga puja is an occasion of major private and public festivities in the eastern and northeastern states of India.

The day of Durga&#x27;s victory is celebrated as Vijayadashami (Bijoya in Bengali), Dashain (Nepali) or Dussehra (in Hindi) – these words literally mean &quot;the victory on the Tenth (day)&quot;.

This festival is an old tradition of Hinduism, though it is unclear how and in which century the festival began. Surviving manuscripts from the 14th century provide guidelines for Durga puja, while historical records suggest royalty and wealthy families were sponsoring major Durga puja public festivities since at least the 16th century. The 11th or 12th century Jainism text &quot;Yasatilaka&quot; by Somadeva mentions a festival and annual dates dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of a Durga puja.

The prominence of Durga puja increased during the British Raj in Bengal. After the Hindu reformists identified Durga with India, she became an icon for the Indian independence movement. The city of Kolkata is famous for Durga puja.

===Dashain===
In Nepal, the festival dedicated to Durga is called Dashain (sometimes spelled as Dasain), which literally means &quot;the ten&quot;. Dashain is the longest national holiday of Nepal, and is a public holiday in Sikkim and Bhutan. During Dashain, Durga is worshipped in ten forms (Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kalaratri, Mahagauri, Mahakali and Durga) with one form for each day in Nepal. The festival includes animal sacrifice in some communities, as well as the purchase of new clothes and gift giving. Traditionally, the festival is celebrated over 15 days, the first nine-day are spent by the faithful by remembering Durga and her ideas, the tenth day marks Durga&#x27;s victory over Mahisura, and the last five days celebrate the victory of good over evil.

During the first nine days, nine aspects of Durga known as Navadurga are meditated upon, one by one during the nine-day festival by devout Hindus. Durga is usually worshipped as a celibate goddess, but the Shaktism traditions includes the worship of Shiva along with Durga, who is considered to be his consort, in addition to Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha and Kartikeya, who are considered to be Durga&#x27;s children by Shaktas. Some Shaktas worship Durga&#x27;s symbolism and presence as Mother Nature. In South India, especially Andhra Pradesh, Dussera Navaratri is also celebrated and the goddess is dressed each day as a different Devi, all considered equivalent but another aspect of Durga.

===Other cultures===
In Bangladesh, the four-day-long Sharadiya Durga Puja is the most important religious festival for the Hindus and celebrated across the country with &quot;Vijayadashami&quot; being a national holiday. In Sri Lanka, Durga in the form of Vaishnavi, bearing Vishnu&#x27;s iconographic symbolism is celebrated. This tradition has been continued by Sri Lankan diaspora.

==Outside Hinduism==
===In Buddhism===

The Tantric Buddhist Vajrayana traditions adopted several Hindu deities into its fold, including Durga. Numerous depictions of Durgā Mahiṣāsuramardinī (Durgā slaying the buffalo demon) have been found at Buddhist temple sites (c. 8th–11th century) in Afghanistan, Indonesia and northeastern India. Durga statues have also been found in major Buddhist sites like Nalanda and Vikramashila.

In Bengal, late Indian Mahayana Buddhists during the 17th century worshiped Durga during traditional Yogini Puja celebrations, and some traces of these Mahayana Durga rites survive today, even though the Bengalis who perform them are no longer Buddhist.

Images of the Buddhist Durga have also been found in Bali (surrounded with images of Buddhas and bodhisattvas) and date from the 10th and 11th centuries.

Durga also appears in the &quot;Sarvadurgatipariśodhana tantra&quot;, though in this text, she appears not in her demon slaying form, but mounted on a lion.

Several aspects of the popular Vajrayana Buddhist goddess Tārā are believed to have originated as a form of the goddess Durga or to have been influenced by Hindu stories of Durga, including Tara&#x27;s fierce forms. One form of Tara is even called Durgottāriṇī-tārā who specializes in saving devotees from evil and rides a lion mount, the traditional mount of Durga. Durgottāriṇī appears in the &quot;Sādhanamālā&quot; (237.10; 237.21; 238.4).

In Nepalese Buddhism, the Buddhist tantric goddess Vajrayogini is &quot;often worshiped interchangeably with Durga&quot; during Durga festivals. Newar Buddhists also worship Durgottāriṇī-tārā during some of their Prajñāpāramitā rituals.

In Japanese Buddhism, the deity Cundī, also known as Butsu-mo (仏母, sometimes called &quot;Koti-sri&quot;), shares many features with Durga, and some scholars have the two deities as related. However, as Gimello notes, they are not the same deity, though they are often confused.

Likewise, in Tibetan Buddhism, the goddess Palden Lhamo also has similar features to the protective and fierce Durga.

===In Jainism===
The &quot;Sacciya mata&quot; found in major medieval era Jain temples mirrors Durga, and she has been identified by Jainism scholars to be the same or sharing a more ancient common lineage. In the Ellora Caves, the Jain temples feature Durga with her lion mount. However, she is not shown as killing the buffalo demon in the Jain cave, but she is presented as a peaceful deity.

===In Sikhism===

Durga is exalted as the divine in &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;, a sacred text of Sikhism that is traditionally attributed to Guru Gobind Singh.

According to Eleanor Nesbitt, this view has been challenged by Sikhs who consider Sikhism to be monotheistic, who hold that a feminine form of the Supreme and a reverence for the Goddess is &quot;unmistakably of Hindu character&quot;.

==Outside the Indian subcontinent==

Archeological site excavations in Indonesia, particularly on the island of Java, have yielded numerous statues of Durga. These have been dated to be from the 6th century onwards. Of the numerous early to mid medieval era Hindu deity stone statues uncovered on Indonesian islands, at least 135 statues are of Durga. In parts of Java, she is known as &quot;Loro Jonggrang&quot; (literally, &quot;slender maiden&quot;).

In Cambodia, during its era of Hindu kings, Durga was popular and numerous sculptures of her have been found. However, most differ from the Indian representation in one detail. The Cambodian Durga iconography shows her standing on top of the cut buffalo demon head.

Durga statues have been discovered at stone temples and archaeological sites in Vietnam, likely related to Champa or Cham dynasty era.

==Influence==
Durga as the mother goddess is the inspiration behind the song Vande Mataram, written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, during the Indian independence movement, later the official national song of India.
Durga is present in Indian nationalism where Bharat Mata i.e. Mother India is viewed as a form of Durga. This is completely secular and keeping in line with the ancient ideology of Durga as Mother and protector to Indians. She is present in pop culture and blockbuster Bollywood movies like &quot;Jai Santoshi Maa&quot;.
The Indian Army uses Hindustani phrases like &quot;Durga Mata ki Jai!&quot; and &quot;Kaali Mata ki Jai!&quot;.
Any woman who takes up a cause to fight for goodness and justice is said to have the spirit of Durga in her.

<text>A subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones.
As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were uncertain whether they should be characterized as tropical or extratropical cyclones. They were officially recognized and titled by the National Hurricane Center in 1972. Beginning in 2002, subtropical cyclones began receiving names from the official tropical cyclone lists in the North Atlantic basin. Subtropical cyclones are also recognized in the South-West Indian Ocean and South Atlantic basins.

There are two definitions currently used for subtropical cyclones depending on their location. Across the north Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean, they require some central convection fairly near the center surrounding a warming core existing in the mid-levels of the troposphere. Across the eastern half of the northern Pacific however, they require a mid-tropospheric cyclone to be cut off from the main belt of the westerlies and with only a weak surface circulation. Subtropical cyclones have wider wind fields with the maximum sustained winds located further from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and have no weather fronts linked into their center.

Since they form from initially extratropical cyclones which have colder temperatures aloft than normally found in the tropics, the sea surface temperatures required for their formation are lower than the tropical cyclone threshold (around 26.5°C (79.7°F)) by 3°C (5°F), lying around 23 °C (73 °F). This also means that subtropical cyclones are more likely to form outside the traditional bounds of the North Atlantic hurricane season and at higher latitudes. Subtropical cyclones are also observed to form in the South Atlantic, where subtropical cyclones are observed in all months.

==History of term==
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the terms semi-tropical and quasi-tropical were used for what would become known as the subtropical cyclones. The term subtropical cyclone initially merely referred to any cyclone located in the subtropical belt near and just north of the horse latitudes. Later, intense debate ensued in the late 1960s, after a number of hybrid cyclones formed in the Atlantic Basin. In 1972, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) finally designated these &quot;hybrid&quot; storms as true subtropical cyclones in real-time, and updated the hurricane database to include subtropical cyclones from 1968 through 1971.

The term &quot;neutercane&quot; began to be used for small subtropical cyclones below 100 miles in diameter which formed from mesoscale features, and the NHC began issuing public statements during the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season employing that classification. This name was not noted as controversial in contemporary news reports, but it was quickly dropped less than a year later. Recent articles, published after the year 2000, have suggested that the name &quot;neutercane&quot; was considered sexist in the 1970s, but there do not appear to be any published reports from that period making this claim.

==Naming==

In the north Atlantic basin, subtropical cyclones were initially named from the NATO phonetic alphabet list in the early to mid-1970s. In the intervening years of 1975–2001, subtropical storms were either named from the traditional list and still was considered tropical in real-time, or used a separate numbering system instead. Between 1992 and 2001, two different numbers were given to subtropical depressions or subtropical storms, one for public use, the other one for NRL and NHC reference. For example, Hurricane Karen in 2001 was initially known as Subtropical Storm One as well as AL1301 (or 13L for short). In 2002, the NHC began giving numbers to subtropical depressions and names to subtropical storms from the same sequence as tropical cyclones. From 2002 onward, Subtropical Depression 13L would be known as Subtropical Depression Thirteen instead. Hurricane Gustav of 2002 was the first subtropical storm to receive a name but became tropical shortly after naming. Subtropical Storm Nicole from the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season was the first subtropical storm that did not become tropical since the policy change. A subtropical storm from the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season also did not become tropical, but was not named since it was not recognized until post-season analysis.

In the southern Indian Ocean, subtropical cyclones are also named once winds reach tropical storm or gale force.

Since 2011, subtropical storms in the western south Atlantic Ocean are named by the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center.

==Formation==

Subtropical cyclones can form in a wide band of latitude, mainly south of the 50th parallel in the northern hemisphere. Due to the increased frequency of cyclones which cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the summer and fall, subtropical cyclones are significantly more frequent across the north Atlantic than the northwestern Pacific Ocean. In the eastern half of the north Pacific Ocean and north Indian Ocean, the older subtropical cyclone definition term is still used, which requires a weak circulation forming underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter), similar to the north Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean. In the case of the north Indian Ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season. In the southern hemisphere, subtropical cyclones are regularly observed across southern portions of the Mozambique Channel.

Most subtropical cyclones form when a deep cold-core extratropical cyclone drops down into the subtropics. The system becomes blocked by a high latitude ridge, and eventually sheds its frontal boundaries as its source of cool and dry air from the high latitudes diverts away from the system, and warms the central circulation, allowing further transition. Temperature differences between the 500 hPa pressure level and the sea surface temperatures initially exceed the dry adiabatic lapse rate, which causes an initial round of thunderstorms to form at a distance east of the center. Due to the initial cold temperatures aloft, sea surface temperatures usually need to reach at least for this initial round of thunderstorms. The initial thunderstorm activity humidifies the environment around the low pressure system, which destabilizes the atmosphere by reducing the lapse rate needed for convection. When the next shortwave or upper-level jet streak (wind maximum within the jet stream) moves nearby, the convection reignites closer to the center, which warms the core and develops the system into a true subtropical cyclone. The average sea surface temperature that helps lead to subtropical cyclogenesis is . If the thunderstorm activity becomes deep and persistent, allowing its initial low level warm core to deepen, extension to tropical cyclogenesis is possible. The locus of formation for north Atlantic subtropical cyclones is out in the open ocean; the island of Bermuda is regularly impacted by these systems.

The south Atlantic environment for formation of subtropical cyclones has both stronger vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures, yet subtropical cyclogenesis is regularly observed in the open ocean in the south Atlantic. A second mechanism for formation has been diagnosed for south Atlantic subtropical cyclones: lee cyclogenesis in the region of the Brazil Current.

Subtropical cyclone formation is extremely rare in the far southeastern Pacific Ocean, due to the cold sea-surface temperatures generated by the Humboldt Current and unfavorable wind shear. In late April 2015, a rare subtropical cyclone was identified to have formed in this region. This system was unofficially dubbed &quot;Katie&quot; by researchers. Another subtropical cyclone was identified at 77.8 degrees longitude in May 2018, just off the coast of Chile. This system was unofficially named &quot;Lexi&quot; by researchers. A subtropical cyclone was spotted just off the Chilean coast in January 2022.

===Transition from extratropical===
By gaining tropical characteristics, an extratropical low may transit into a subtropical depression or storm. A subtropical depression/storm may further gain tropical characteristics to become a pure tropical depression or storm, which may eventually develop into a hurricane, and there are at least ten cases of tropical cyclones transforming into a subtropical cyclone (Tropical Storm Gilda in 1973, Subtropical Storm Four in 1974, Tropical Storm Jose in 1981, Hurricane Klaus in 1984, Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Tropical Storm Lee in 2011, Hurricane Humberto in 2013, Tropical Storm Ian in 2016, Typhoon Jelawat in 2018, and Typhoon Surigae in 2021). There have also been three recorded cases of a storm transitioning from tropical to extratropical back to a subtropical cyclone; as seen with the Caribbean–Azores hurricane in 1970, Hurricane Georges in 1980, and Hurricane Beryl in 2018. Generally, a tropical storm or tropical depression is not called subtropical while it is becoming extratropical and vice versa, after hitting either land or colder waters. This transition normally requires significant instability through the atmosphere, with temperature differences between the underlying ocean and the mid-levels of the troposphere requiring over 38 °C, or 68 °F, of contrast in this roughly layer of the lower atmosphere. The mode of the sea surface temperatures that subtropical cyclones form over is . Transition from subtropical cyclones into fully tropical cyclones occurs only in very rare cases over the south Atlantic Ocean, such as Hurricane Catarina in 2004.

==Characteristics==
===Intensity===
Subtropical cyclones can have maximum winds extending farther from the center than in a purely tropical cyclone and have no weather fronts linking directly to the center of circulation. In the Atlantic Basin, the United States NOAA classifies subtropical cyclones similarly to tropical cyclones, based on maximum sustained surface winds. Those with winds below 18 m/s, (65 km/h, 35 knots, or 39 mph) are called subtropical depressions, while those at or above this speed are referred to as subtropical storms. Diagrams which depict a cyclone&#x27;s phase depict subtropical cyclones with a shallow warm core and as asymmetric systems, similar to tropical cyclones which have begun the transition to an extratropical cyclone.

Subtropical cyclones with hurricane-force winds of 33 m/s, (119 km/h, 64 knots, or 74 mph) or greater are no longer recognized by the National Hurricane Center. Once a subtropical storm intensifies enough to have hurricane-force winds, it is then automatically assumed to have become a fully tropical hurricane even if it still has subtropical characteristics. Despite this however, prior to the start of modern policies in the Atlantic there were two subtropical cyclones, one in 1968 and another in 1979, that attained hurricane-force winds while subtropical. In addition, one system, Subtropical Depression 11 during the 2000–01 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, was analyzed by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to have reached hurricane strength as a subtropical cyclone, but Météo-France (MFR) only considers it to have been a subtropical depression.

===Examples during the off-season===

Subtropical cyclones are more likely than tropical cyclones to form outside of a region&#x27;s designated hurricane season. Examples during the 21st century in the north Atlantic include:

* Subtropical Storm Ana (which became Tropical Storm Ana) in late-April of the 2003 hurricane season.
* Subtropical Storm Andrea in early-May of the 2007 hurricane season.
* Subtropical Storm Olga (which became Tropical Storm Olga) in mid-December of the 2007 hurricane season.
* Subtropical Storm Beryl (which became Tropical Storm Beryl) in late-May of the 2012 hurricane season.
* An unnamed subtropical storm in early-December of the 2013 hurricane season.
* Subtropical Storm Ana (which became Tropical Storm Ana) in early-May of the 2015 hurricane season.
* Subtropical Storm Alex (which became Hurricane Alex) in mid-January of the 2016 hurricane season.
* Subtropical Depression One (which became Tropical Storm Arlene) in mid-April of the 2017 hurricane season.
*Subtropical Storm Alberto (which became Tropical Storm Alberto) in late-May of the 2018 hurricane season.
*Subtropical Storm Andrea in late-May of the 2019 hurricane season.
*Subtropical Storm Ana (which became Tropical Storm Ana) in late-May of the 2021 hurricane season.
*An unnamed subtropical storm in mid-January of the 2023 hurricane season.

==Types==
===Upper-level low===
The most common type of subtropical storm is an upper-level cold low with circulation extending to the surface layer and maximum sustained winds generally occurring at a radius of about or more from the center. In comparison to tropical cyclones, such systems have a relatively wide zone of maximum winds that is located further from the center, and typically have a less symmetric wind field and distribution of convection.

===Mesoscale low===
A second type of subtropical cyclone is a mesoscale low originating in or near a frontolyzing zone of horizontal wind shear, also known as a &quot;dying&quot; frontal zone, with radius of maximum sustained winds generally less than . The entire circulation may initially have a diameter of less than . These generally short-lived systems may be either cold core or warm core, and in 1972 this type of subtropical cyclone was ephemerally referred to as a &quot;neutercane&quot;.

==Kona storm==
Kona storms (or Kona lows) are deep cyclones that form during the cool winter season of the central Pacific Ocean. A definition change in the term during the early 1970s makes categorization of the systems more complex, as many kona lows are extratropical cyclones, complete with their own weather fronts. Those across the northeast Pacific Ocean consider them subtropical cyclones as long as a weak surface circulation is present. &quot;Kona&quot; is a Hawaiian term for &quot;leeward&quot;, which explains the change in wind direction for the Hawaiian Islands from easterly to southerly when this type of cyclone is present.

==Australian east coast lows==
Australian east coast lows (known locally as east coast lows and sometimes as east coast cyclones) are extratropical cyclones, the most intense of these systems have many of the characteristics of subtropical cyclones. They develop between 25° south and 40° south and within 5° of the Australian coastline, also typically during the winter months. Each year there are about ten &quot;significant impact&quot; maritime lows. Explosive cyclogenesis is seen on average just once per year, but these storms cause significant wind and flood damage when they occur. Australian east coast cyclones vary in size from mesoscale (approximately 10 km to 100 km) to synoptic scale (approximately 100 km to 1,000 km). These storms which mostly affect the southeast coast should not be confused with Australian region tropical cyclones which typically affect the northern half of the continent instead.

<doc id="100196" wikidata="Q3431457" url="?curid=100196" title="Tim Westwood">
<text>Timothy Westwood (born 3 October 1957), often known professionally simply as Westwood, is a British DJ and presenter. He was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2022 as &quot;a veteran of the hip-hop scene whose opinions have been able to make or break upcoming artists for more than 30 years&quot;. He hosted the Radio 1 rap show and presented the MTV UK show &quot;Pimp My Ride UK&quot;. In 2013, he left Radio 1 and 1Xtra after nearly twenty years and returned to Capital Radio.

Investigations by the BBC and &quot;The Guardian&quot; into Westwood&#x27;s sexual conduct found seven women who accused Westwood of sexual violence, as described in the BBC Three documentary &quot;Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power&quot;.

==Early life==
The son of Bill Westwood, who later became Anglican Bishop of Peterborough, Westwood spent his early years in Lowestoft, where his father was parish priest, and moved to Norwich aged eight, when his father became vicar of St Peter Mancroft. He attended the independent Norwich School and the state comprehensive Hewett School in Norwich. He was diagnosed as dyslexic, and later said that, when at school, he was bottom of his class, &quot;clueless at work and poor at sports.&quot;

==Career==
===Live===
Westwood&#x27;s career started in the late 1970s and early 1980s when he helped set up sound systems in clubs in northwest London, taking opportunities to work as a DJ, and then warming up for David Rodigan. At the time, he played reggae and jazz-funk.

Westwood was injured in a drive-by shooting in Kennington, south London, on 18 July 1999, after he had been playing at the Lambeth Country Show in Brockwell Park. According to police reports, gunmen on a motorbike pulled up alongside his Range Rover and shot him and his assistant. He alleged that the gunmen were gang members who had been threatening him to stop playing shows in the neighbourhood.

===Radio===
Westwood&#x27;s first radio show was on the London pirate radio station LWR. He then moved to Kiss FM, which he co-owned. He was on Capital FM from 1987, and in 1994 he moved to BBC Radio 1 to present its new rap show. The show was launched with a live concert with the Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy. The Westwood &quot;Radio 1 Rap Show&quot; was the top ranked hip hop show in the UK. His Radio 1 show was produced by his independent company Justice Entertainment, which also produced Chris Goldfinger&#x27;s dancehall show for Radio 1 at the time. 
 Westwood was a patron of the internal radio station at Feltham Young Offenders&#x27; Institution in west London.

At the BBC, Westwood also hosted the weekday drivetime show for Radio 1Xtra from September 2009 until he was replaced by Charlie Sloth in September 2012. After leaving the drivetime show, Westwood continued his Saturday night Rap Show which now ran from 21:00 until 23:00 and was a simulcast on Radio 1 and 1Xtra. It was announced on 26 July 2013 that he was leaving the BBC after nearly twenty years as part of planned schedule changes, which took effect on 21 September.

After leaving the BBC, Westwood re-joined Capital FM on its sister station, Capital Xtra, initially occupying the 21:00–23:00 slot on Saturday nights. His show on Capital Xtra then moved to 19:00–22:00, followed by 19:00–0:00, and then 19:00–23:00.

===Television===
After creating and presenting the 1987 BBC &quot;Open Space&quot; documentary &quot;Bad Meaning Good,&quot; he achieved further TV exposure in the late 1980s as part of ITV&#x27;s late-night programming block &quot;Night Network&quot;, for which he hosted the programmes &quot;N Sign Radio&quot; and &quot;The Rap Show&quot;.

He later presented a series of his own television programmes on UKTV channel UK Play, which has since ceased broadcasting.

====&quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;====

Westwood hosted the MTV series &quot;Pimp My Ride UK&quot; which ran for three seasons, from 2005 to 2007. The show was an adaption of the American MTV series &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, featuring one car in each episode being renovated and customized (&quot;pimped&quot;) to match the owner&#x27;s interests.

A special episode of the show called &quot;Pimp Madonna&#x27;s Ride&quot; aired on MTV on Sunday 19 February 2006, the eve of the release of the single &quot;Sorry&quot;. The interior of the van was pimped by MTV UK for the single&#x27;s music video, which was filmed in London in January 2006. The exterior of the vehicle was kept original. At the time, &quot;Pimp My Ride UK&quot; was the most successful MTV UK production of all time and the second highest rated show in the history of MTV Europe.

====Tim Westwood TV====
Westwood&#x27;s official YouTube channel Tim Westwood TV has over 500 million video views and over 1 million subscribers. The channel has videos of freestyles and interviews from hip-hop and grime artists, including The Notorious B.I.G., Eminem, Jay-Z, Nas, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Will Smith, Drake, Amerado, and Rae Sremmurd.

===Albums and awards===
Westwood has released fourteen compilation albums. The Platinum Edition compilation was the biggest-selling British urban album of all time upon its release in 2003.

Westwood has won the 2016 Legacy Award at the GRM Daily Rated Awards, the 2010 Radio Academy John Peel Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the MOBO Awards for Best Radio DJ in 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2008. He was nominated for Sony Radio&#x27;s Music Broadcaster of the Year award in 2003 and 2006.

===Self-presentation===
On 6 June 2006, Radio 1 and Westwood&#x27;s show in particular was accused of encouraging knife and gun crime by the Leader of the Conservative Party and then Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, who was speaking at a British Society of Magazine Editors event. Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt responded in a Press Association news agency article: &quot;There&#x27;s been a debate about this particular genre of music for many years. Hip-hop is of great interest to many people in our audience. I strongly refute that any of our programmes condone violence, gun crime or knife crime&quot;. Critics have derided Westwood&#x27;s apparent Black British pronunciation and dialect. In interviews, Sacha Baron Cohen has stated that Westwood, including his accent, was an inspiration for his fictional Ali G character. Westwood has also been accused in the media of giving false statements about his age and background. In 2000, at the age of 43, Westwood insisted to a &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist that he was aged 27.

== Sexual assault allegations ==
In July 2020, Global Media &amp; Entertainment, the parent company of Capital Xtra, was criticised for failing to investigate allegations that Westwood had behaved inappropriately with young female fans. Westwood responded: &quot;I can confirm that such allegations are false and without any foundation.&quot; In April 2022, as a result of a joint investigation by BBC News and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, covered in the BBC Three documentary &quot;Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power&quot;, Westwood was accused by seven women of sexual misconduct between 1992 and 2017. He denied the allegations. Nevertheless, Global, Capital&#x27;s parent company, announced in late April 2022 that he was stepping down from his show until further notice, while several venues cancelled appearances by Westwood.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported in July 2022 that seventeen women had made allegations against Westwood. He also faced an allegation from a woman that they had sex when she was fourteen. In August 2022, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that they were investigating allegations against Westwood of sexual offences. , no charges have been filed.

The BBC director general Tim Davie described the allegations as &quot;shocking&quot;, though also stated that he could find no previous formal complaints about Westwood. In July 2022, following a Freedom of Information request in relation to the BBC and &quot;Guardian&quot; investigation, the BBC said it had received six complaints about Westwood and referred one to the police. KC Gemma White announced an investigation to determine whether or not the BBC knew of the allegations during Westwood&#x27;s nearly-20-year career with them.

<doc id="100197" wikidata="Q602939" url="?curid=100197" title="French Quarter">
<text>The French Quarter, also known as the (; ; ), is the oldest neighborhood in the city of New Orleans. After New Orleans () was founded in 1718 by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, the city developed around the (&quot;Old Square&quot; in English), a central square. The district is more commonly called the French Quarter today, or simply &quot;The Quarter&quot;, related to changes in the city with American immigration after the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. Most of the extant historic buildings were constructed either in the late 18th century, during the city&#x27;s period of Spanish rule, or were built during the first half of the 19th century, after U.S. purchase and statehood.

The district as a whole has been designated as a National Historic Landmark, with numerous contributing buildings that are separately deemed significant. It is a prime tourist destination in the city, as well as attracting local residents.

The French Quarter suffered relatively light damage from floodwater as compared to other areas of the city and the greater region, due to its distance from areas where the levee was breached during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as well as the strength and height of the nearest Mississippi River Levees in contrast to other levees along the canals and lakefront.

==History==
The French claimed Louisiana in the 1690s and Jean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville was appointed Director General in charge of developing a colony in the territory, and founded New Orleans in 1718. In 1721, the royal engineer Adrien de Pauger designed the city&#x27;s street layout. He named the streets after French royal houses and Catholic saints, and paid homage to France&#x27;s ruling family, the House of Bourbon, with the naming of Bourbon Street. New Orleans was ceded to the Spanish in 1763 following the Seven Years&#x27; War. The Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 and another in 1794 destroyed 80 percent of the city&#x27;s buildings, and so nearly all the French Quarter dates from the late 1790s onwards.

The Spanish introduced strict new fire codes that banned wooden siding in favor of fire-resistant brick, which was covered in stucco, painted in the pastel hues fashionable at the time. The old French peaked roofs were replaced with flat tiled ones, but the still largely French population continued to build in similar styles, influenced by colonial architecture of the Caribbean, such as timber balconies and galleries. (In southeast Louisiana, a distinction is made between &quot;balconies&quot;, which are self-supporting and attached to the side of the building, and &quot;galleries,&quot; which are supported from the ground by poles or columns.)

When Anglophone Americans began to move in after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, they mostly built on available land upriver, across modern-day Canal Street. This thoroughfare became the meeting place of two cultures, one Francophone Creole and the other Anglophone American. (Local landowners had retained architect and surveyor Barthelemy Lafon to subdivide their property to create an American suburb). The median of the wide boulevard became a place where the two contentious cultures could meet and do business in both French and English. As such, it became known as the &quot;neutral ground&quot;, and this name is still used for medians in the New Orleans area.

During the 19th century, New Orleans was similar to other Southern cities in that its economy was based on selling cash crops, such as sugar, tobacco and cotton produced by enslaved labor. By 1840, newcomers whose wealth came from these enterprises turned New Orleans into the third largest metropolis in the country. The city&#x27;s port was the nation&#x27;s second largest, with New York City being the largest.

The development of New Orleans famous ornate cast iron &#x27;galleries&#x27; began with the two storey examples on the Pontalba Buildings on Jackson Square, completed in 1851. As the most prominent and high class address at the time, they set a fashion for others to follow, and multi-level cast iron galleries soon replaced the old timber French ones on older buildings as well as gracing new ones.

Even before the Civil War, French Creoles had become a minority in the French Quarter. In the late 19th century the Quarter became a less fashionable part of town, and many immigrants from southern Italy and Ireland settled there. From 1884 to 1924 an estimated 290,000 Italian immigrants, a great deal of them from Sicily, arrived in New Orleans and settled in the French Quarter, which acquired the nickname &quot;Little Palermo.&quot; In 1905, the Italian consul estimated that one-third to one-half of the Quarter&#x27;s population were Italian-born or second generation Italian-Americans. Irish immigrants also settled heavily in the Esplanade area, which was called the &quot;Irish Channel&quot;.

In 1917, the closure of Storyville sent much of the vice formerly concentrated therein back into the French Quarter, which &quot;for most of the remaining French Creole families . . was the last straw, and they began to move uptown.&quot; This, combined with the loss of the French Opera House two years later, provided a bookend to the era of French Creole culture in the Quarter. Many of the remaining French Creoles moved to the university area.

In the early 20th century, the Quarter&#x27;s cheap rents and air of decay attracted a bohemian artistic community, a trend which became pronounced in the 1920s. Many of these new inhabitants were active in the first preservation efforts in the Quarter, which began around that time. As a result, the Vieux Carré Commission (VCC) was established in 1925, spearheaded by Elizabeth Werlein. Although initially only an advisory body, a 1936 referendum to amend the Louisiana constitution afforded it a measure of regulatory power. It began to exercise more power in the 1940s to preserve and protect the district.
Meanwhile, World War II brought thousands of servicemen and war workers to New Orleans as well as to the surrounding region&#x27;s military bases and shipyards. Many of these sojourners paid visits to the Vieux Carré. Although nightlife and vice had already begun to coalesce on Bourbon Street in the two decades following the closure of Storyville, the war produced a larger, more permanent presence of exotic, risqué, and often raucous entertainment on what became the city&#x27;s most famous strip. Years of repeated crackdowns on vice in Bourbon Street clubs, which took on new urgency under Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison, reached a crescendo with District Attorney Jim Garrison&#x27;s raids in 1962, but Bourbon Street&#x27;s clubs were soon back in business.

The plan to construct an elevated Riverfront Expressway between the Mississippi River levee and the French Quarter consumed the attention of Vieux Carré preservationists through much of the 1960s. On December 21, 1965, the &quot;Vieux Carre Historic District&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark. After waging a decade-long battle against the Vieux Carré Riverfront Expressway that utilized the newly passed National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, preservationists and their allies forced the issue into federal court, eventually producing the cancellation of the freeway plan in 1969.

The victory was important for the preservation of the French Quarter, but it was hardly the only challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of the French Quarter. The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré&#x27;s charm might be compromised by the introduction of too many new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district&#x27;s boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of timeshare condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout the French Quarter or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World&#x27;s Fair site nearby.

More of the neighborhood was developed to support tourism, which is important to the city&#x27;s economy. But, the French Quarter still combines residential, hotels, guest houses, bars, restaurants and tourist-oriented commercial properties.

===Effect of Hurricane Katrina===
As with other parts of the city developed before the late 19th century, and on higher land predating New Orleans&#x27; levee systems, the French Quarter remained substantially dry following Hurricane Katrina. Its elevation is five feet (1.5 m) above sea level. Some streets had minor flooding, and several buildings suffered significant wind damage. Most of the major landmarks suffered only minor damage. In addition, the Quarter largely escaped the looting and violence that occurred after the storm; nearly all of the antique shops and art galleries in the French Quarter, for example, were untouched.

Mayor Ray Nagin officially reopened the French Quarter on September 26, 2005 (almost a month after the storm), for business owners to inspect their property and clean up. Within a few weeks, a large selection of French Quarter businesses had reopened. The Historic New Orleans Collection&#x27;s Williams Research Center Annex was the first new construction completed in the French Quarter after Hurricane Katrina.

===Post-Katrina===
In 2020 Mayor of New Orleans LaToya Cantrell proposed ending use of automobiles in the French Quarter.

===2025 truck attack===
Early on the morning of January 1st, 2025, a man later identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a pick-up truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 and injuring at least 36, including two police officers who were shot. Jabbar was shot and killed by police after crashing into a crane and leaving the vehicle armed with two firearms. The crime, which the FBI is currently investigating as an act of terrorism, occurred during New Year&#x27;s celebrations and a day before the city hosted the Sugar Bowl. The FBI stated that they did not believe Jabbar worked alone. Security footage showed three men and one woman planting an explosive device in the French Quarter. Pipe bombs were found in coolers on Bourbon Street.

==Geography==
The French Quarter is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of . of which is land and (25.76%) of which is water.

===Boundaries===
The most common definition of the French Quarter includes all the land stretching along the Mississippi River from Canal Street to Esplanade Avenue (13 blocks) and inland to North Rampart Street (seven to nine blocks). It equals an area of 78 square blocks. Some definitions, such as city zoning laws, exclude the properties facing Canal Street, which had already been redeveloped by the time architectural preservation was considered, and the section between Decatur Street and the river, much of which had long served industrial and warehousing functions.

Any alteration to structures in the remaining blocks is subject to review by the Vieux Carré Commission, which determines whether the proposal is appropriate for the historic character of the district. Its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: Esplanade Avenue to the north, the Mississippi River to the east, Canal Street, Decatur Street and Iberville Street to the south and the Basin Street, St. Louis Street and North Rampart Street to the west.

The National Historic Landmark district is stated to be 85 square blocks. The Quarter is subdistrict of the French Quarter/CBD Area.

==Landmarks and attractions==

===Jackson Square===

Jackson Square (formerly or , in French and Spanish, respectively), originally designed by architect and landscaper Louis H. Pilié (officially credited only with the iron fence), is a public, gated park the size of a city block, located at the front of the French Quarter (GPS ). In the mid-19th century, the square was named after President (formerly General, of Battle of New Orleans acclaim) Andrew Jackson.

In 1856, city leaders purchased an equestrian statue of Jackson from the sculptor Clark Mills. The statue was placed at the center of the square, which was converted to a park from its previous use as a military parade ground and execution site. (Convicted criminals were sometimes hanged in the square. After the slave insurrection of 1811 during the U.S. territorial period, some of the insurgents were sentenced to death here in Orleans Parish under a justice system which had not yet been converted to American ideals, and their severed heads were displayed here.)

The square originally overlooked the Mississippi River across Decatur Street; however, the view was blocked in the 19th century when larger levees were built along the river. The riverfront was long devoted to shipping-related activities at the heart of the port. The administration of Mayor Moon Landrieu put in a scenic boardwalk across from Jackson Square; it is known as the &quot;Moon Walk&quot; in his honor. At the end of the 1980s, old wharves and warehouses were demolished to create Woldenberg Park, extending the riverfront promenade up to Canal Street.

On the opposite side of the square from the River are three 18th‑century historic buildings, which were the city&#x27;s heart in the colonial era. The center of the three is St. Louis Cathedral. The cathedral was designated a minor basilica by Pope Paul VI. To its left is the Cabildo, the old city hall, now a museum, where the final transfer papers for the Louisiana Purchase were signed. To the cathedral&#x27;s right is the Presbytère, built to match the Cabildo. The Presbytère, originally planned to house the city&#x27;s Roman Catholic priests and authorities, was adapted as a courthouse at the start of the 19th century after the Louisiana Purchase, when civilian government was elevated over church authority. In the 20th century it was adapted as a museum.

On each side of the square are the Pontalba Buildings, matching red-brick, one-block-long, four‑story buildings constructed between 1849 and 1851. The ground floors house shops and restaurants; the upper floors are apartments. The buildings were planned as row townhouses; they were not converted to rental apartments until the 1930s (during the Great Depression).

The buildings were designed and constructed by Baroness Micaela Almonester Pontalba, daughter of Don Andres Almonaster y Rojas, a prominent Spanish philanthropist in Creole New Orleans. Micaela Almonaster was born in Louisiana in 1795. Her father died three years later, and she became sole heiress to his fortune and his New Orleans land holdings.

Directly across from Jackson Square is the Jax Brewery building, the original home of a local beer. After the company ceased to operate independently, the building was converted for use by retail businesses, including restaurants and specialty shops. In recent years, some retail space has been converted into riverfront condominiums. Behind the Jax Brewery lies the Toulouse Street Wharf, the regular pier for the excursion steamboat, &quot;Natchez&quot;.

From the 1920s through the 1980s, Jackson Square became known for attracting painters, young art students, and caricaturists. In the 1990s, the artists were joined by tarot card readers, mimes, fortune tellers, and other street performers.

Live music has been a regular feature of the entire Quarter, including the Square, for more than a century. Formal concerts are also held, although more rarely. Street musicians play for tips.

Diagonally across the square from the Cabildo is Café du Monde, open 24 hours a day except for Christmas Day. The historic open-air cafe is known for its café au lait, its coffee blended with chicory, and its beignets, made and served there continuously since the Civil War period (1862). It is a custom for anyone visiting for the first time to blow the powdered sugar off a beignet and make a wish.

===Bourbon Street===
The most well-known of the French Quarter streets, Bourbon Street, or Rue Bourbon, is known for its drinking establishments. Most of the bars frequented by tourists are new but the Quarter also has a number of notable bars with interesting histories. The Old Absinthe House has kept its name even though absinthe was banned in the U.S. from 1915 to 2007 because it was believed to have toxic qualities.

Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bar is known both for inventing the red Hurricane cocktail and for having the first dueling piano bar. Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s is located at 718 St. Peter Street.

Lafitte&#x27;s Blacksmith Shop is a tavern located on the corner of Bourbon and St. Philip streets. Built sometime before 1772, it is one of the older surviving structures in New Orleans. It is also the oldest bar in all of America that still operates as a bar. According to legend, the structure was once a business owned by the Lafitte brothers, perhaps as a &quot;front&quot; for their smuggling operations at Barataria Bay.

The Napoleon House bar and restaurant is in the former home of mayor Nicholas Girod. It was named for an unrealized plot to rescue Napoleon from his exile in Saint Helena and bring him to New Orleans.

The original Johnny White&#x27;s bar is a favorite of motorcycle bikers. In 2005 an offshoot called Johnny White&#x27;s Hole in the Wall, along with Molly&#x27;s at the Market, drew national media attention as the only businesses in the city to stay open throughout Hurricane Katrina and the weeks after the storm.

Spirits on Bourbon was featured on the season three of &quot;Bar Rescue.&quot; It has become a staple of Bourbon Street, with its light-up skull cup and Resurrection drink.

The Bourbon Pub and Oz, both located at the intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann Streets, are the two largest gay clubs in New Orleans. Café Lafitte in Exile, located at the intersection of Bourbon and Dumaine, is the oldest continuously running gay bar in the United States. These and other gay establishments sponsor the raucous Southern Decadence Festival during Labor Day weekend. This festival is often referred to as New Orleans&#x27; Gay Mardi Gras. St. Ann Street is often called &quot;the Lavender Line&quot; or &quot;the Velvet Line&quot; in reference to its being on the edge of the French Quarter&#x27;s predominately gay district. While gay residents live throughout the French Quarter, that portion northeast of St. Ann Street is generally considered to be the gay district.

New Orleans and its French Quarter are one of a few places in the United States where possession and consumption of alcohol in open containers is allowed on the street. French Quarter Street is also home to jazz music; there are many street performers and jazz shops. Many streets are filled with jazz clubs with live jazz performances, making it an attractive destination in the neighborhood.

===Museums===

The French Quarter boasts several museums, including the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum, New Orleans Pharmacy Museum, New Orleans Jazz Museum, and the Museum of Death.

===Restaurants===
The neighborhood contains many restaurants, ranging from formal to casual, patronized by both visitors and locals. Some are well-known landmarks, such as Antoine&#x27;s and Tujague&#x27;s, which have been in business since the 19th century. Arnaud&#x27;s, Galatoire&#x27;s, Broussard&#x27;s, and Brennan&#x27;s are also venerable.

Less historic—but also well-known—French Quarter restaurants include those run by chefs Paul Prudhomme (&quot;K-Paul&#x27;s&quot;), Emeril Lagasse (&quot;NOLA&quot;), and John Besh. Port of Call on Esplanade Avenue has been in business for more than 30 years, and is recognized for its popular &quot;Monsoon&quot; drink (their answer to the &quot;Hurricane&quot; at Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bar) as well as for its food.

The Gumbo Shop is another traditional eatery in the Quarter and where casual dress is acceptable. For a take-out lunch, Central Grocery on Decatur Street is the home of the original muffaletta Italian sandwich, with New Orleans being a major center for Italian cuisine in the American South.

===Hotels===

Accommodations in the French Quarter range from large international chain hotels, to bed and breakfasts, to time-share condominiums and small guest houses with only one or two rooms. The French Quarter is known for its traditional-style hotels, such as the Bourbon Orleans, Hotel Monteleone (family-owned), Royal Sonesta, the Astor, and the Omni Royal Orleans. The Hotel St. Pierre is a small hotel also consisting of historic French Quarter houses, with a courtyard patio.

The Audubon Cottages are a collection of seven Creole cottages, two of which were utilized by John James Audubon in the early 19th century when he worked in New Orleans for a short time. Also utilized by Audubon was the current breakfast room of the Dauphine Orleans Hotel, a 111-room hotel located on Dauphine Street. The Dauphine Orleans Hotel&#x27;s on-site bar, May Baily&#x27;s Place, was once one of New Orleans&#x27; most-known brothels, and it is rumored that the ghosts of prostitutes and American Civil War soldiers haunt the property.

==Education==

Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB) manages the public school system.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans operates area Catholic schools. Cathedral Academy, originally St. Louis Cathedral School, was in the French Quarter. It opened in 1914, and had a building separate from that of its parish. In 2012 the archdiocese decided to close the school. It had 156 students in 2012, and the archdiocese&#x27;s criterion for optimal enrollment in a K–7 was 200. St. Stephen School in Uptown New Orleans offered places to St. Louis Cathedral students. Cathedral Academy parents stated opposition against the closure.

<doc id="100200" wikidata="Q2228265" url="?curid=100200" title="Savitr">
<text>Savitṛ ( , nominative singular: , also rendered as Savitur), in Vedic scriptures is an Aditya (i.e., an &quot;offspring&quot;) of the Vedic primeval mother goddess Aditi. His name in Vedic Sanskrit connotes &quot;impeller, rouser, vivifier.&quot;

He is sometimes identified with—and at other times distinguished from—Surya, &quot;the Sun god&quot;. When considered distinct from the Sun proper, he is conceived of as the divine influence or vivifying power of the Sun. The Sun before sunrise is called Savitr, and after sunrise until sunset it is called Sūrya.
Savitr is venerated in the Rig Veda, the oldest component of the Vedic scriptures. He is first recorded in book three of the Rigveda; (RV 3.62.10) later called the Gayatri mantra. Furthermore, he is described with great detail in Hymn 35 of the Rig Veda, also called the Hymn of Savitr. In this hymn, Savitr is personified and represented as a patron deity. He is celebrated in eleven whole hymns of the Rig Veda and in parts of many others texts, with his name being mentioned about 170 times in aggregate..

Savitr disappeared as an independent deity from the Hindu pantheon after the end of the Vedic period, but is still worshiped in modern Hinduism and is referred to as &quot;Sāvitrī.&quot;

==Rigvedic deity==
Savitr is a deity whose name primarily denotes an agent, in the form of a noun derived from a verbal root with the agent suffix &quot;-tṛ&quot; added.
The name of Savitr belongs to a class of Vedic theonyms, together with Dhatṛ, Tratṛ and Tvastr. These names denote that these are agent gods, who create, protect, and produce, respectively.

===Appearance===
Savitr has golden arms, and is broad-handed or beautiful-handed. He is also pleasant tongued or beautiful-tongued, and is once called iron-jawed. His eyes are golden as well. He is yellow-haired, an attribute shared with Agni and Indra. He dons on a tawny garb. He has a golden chariot with a golden axle, which is omni-form, just as he himself is capable of assuming all forms. His channel is analogized as a resplendent chariot drawn by two radiant steeds or by two or more bronze, white-footed stallions. Mighty splendour (&quot;amati&quot;) is preeminently attributed to Savitr, and mighty &quot;golden&quot; splendour to him only. Such splendour he stretches out or diffuses. He illumines the air, heaven and earth, the world, the spaces of the earth, the vault of heaven.

===Functions===
Like Pushan and Surya, he is lord of that which is mobile and is stationary. Savitr has been attributed to as upholding the movables and immovable, which signifies the maintenance of Ṛta. Savitr is a beneficent god who acts as protector of all beings, who are provident and guard the world of spirits. Being an Aditya, Savitr is true to the Eternal Order and act as the score exacter.

His primordial pathways in the air are dustless and sleekly traversed, on them he is besought to fortify his invokers. He is prayed to convey the departed soul to where the righteous dwell. Savitr bestows immortality on the gods as well as length of life on man. He also bestowed immortality on the Rbhus, who by the greatness of their deeds advanced to his dwelling. Like other gods, Savitr is a supporter of the cosmos. Also, he holds the whole world, a role which was also assigned to Vishnu in the Vedas.

===Abstract classification===
There are two classes of deities in the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; whose nature is founded on abstraction.
* The first class, consisting of the direct personifications of abstract notions – such as &#x27;desire&#x27; – is rare, occurring only in the very latest hymns of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; and due to that growth of speculation which is so plainly traceable in the course of the Vedic age.

* The second and more numerous class comprises deities whose names primarily either denote an agent, in the form of a noun derived from a root with the suffix &quot;-tṛ&quot; (such as &quot;Dhatr&quot;, &#x27;Creator&#x27;) or designate some attribute, such as &quot;Prajapati&quot; (&#x27;Lord of Creatures&#x27;).

The class, judged by the evolution of the mythological creations of the Veda, does not represent direct abstractions, but appears in each case to be derived from an epithet applied to one or more deities, illustrating a particular aspect of activity or character. Such epithets gradually become detached, finally attaining an independent status. Thus &quot;Rohita&quot;, the &#x27;Red One&#x27; (whose female form is &quot;Rohinī&quot;), originally an epithet of the sun, as a separate deity in the capacity of a Creator.
&quot;Savitr&quot; is never mentioned as having part in the Soma sacrifice
===Solar aspects===
According to Yaska, Sanskrit scholar of the 5th century BCE, who made various attempts to interpret difficult Vedic mythologies in his work &quot;Nirukta&quot; (&quot;Etymology&quot;) (12, 12), the time of Savitr’s appearance is when darkness has been removed. Sayanacharya (on &quot;Rig Veda&quot;) remarks that before his rising the sun is called Savitr, but from his rising to his setting, Surya. But Savitr is also sometimes spoken of as &quot;sending to sleep&quot;, and must therefore be connected with evening as well as morning. He is, indeed, extolled as the setting sun in one hymn (2, 38); and there are indications that most of the hymns addressed to him are meant for either a morning or an evening sacrifice. He brings all two-footed and four-footed beings to rest and awakens them. He unyokes his steeds, brings the wanderer to rest; at his command night comes; the weaver rolls up her web and the skilful man lays down his unfinished work. Later the west was wont to be assigned to him, as the east to Agni, and the south to Soma.

The epithet &quot;sūrya-raśmi&quot; is used in the Rig Veda only once, and it is applied to Savitr:
 &quot;Radiating with the beams of the Sun, golden-haired, Savitr raises up His effulgence continually from the east.&quot;

Like Surya, Savitr is implored to remove evil nightmares and to render men sinless. Savitr drives away sorcerers and antagonism. He observes fixed laws. The waters and the wind are subject to his ordinance. He leads the waters and by his propulsion they flow broadly. The other gods follow his lead. No being, not even Indra, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, Rudra, can resist his will and independent dominion. His praises are celebrated by the Vasus, Aditi, Varuna, Mitra and Aryaman. He is lord of all things worthy, and bestows blessings pervading heaven, air, earth.
... the connection of Savitr with the sun is fairly close. It is at least possible, therefore, that in its origin Savitr was not an independent creation, but was an epithet of Surya, but that question is of little importance: The essential feature of the god is not his original basis, but his function as the inspirer or impeller to holy sacrifice: The ritual act is repeatedly said in the Yajur Veda to be done ‘on the instigation of the god Savitr’.

In several passages of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, Savitr and Surya appear simultaneously. It may even appear based on A.B. Keith&#x27;s opinion that the terms Savitar and Surya are used interchangeably in certain hymns of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;. However it is worth noting that several other deities are directly associated with the epithet of Savitar in the &quot;Family Books&quot;. They include Indra who is paired alongside Savitar, and Tvastr who is compounded with Savitar. Furthermore, Savitar is unambiguously identified with Bhaga. Savitar is also unambiguously called Pusan and Mitra. While Savitar certainly has directly been charged with using Surya&#x27;s rays, Savitar has a much more direct congruence with other deities. The Vedic poet observes:
 &quot;[G]od Savitr has raised aloft his brilliance, making light for the whole world; Surya shining brightly has filled heaven and earth and air with his rays.&quot;

In another hymn Surya is spoken of in terms &quot;Prasavitṛ&quot; (Vivifier), an adjective usually applied to Savitr, and in the third verse Savitr is apparently mentioned as the same god as Surya. In other hymns also, it is hardly possible to separate the two deities. In certain passages, Savitr combines with the rays of the sun or shines with the rays of the sun.

Savitr has a major role in creation. The relevant hymn mentions that:
&quot;Indra measured six broad spaces, from which no existing thing is excluded: He it is who made the wide expanse of earth and the lofty dome of the sky, even he.&quot; Savitr assisted Indra in shaping the universe.

[T]here are in the last book of the Rig Veda some hymns which treat the origin of the world philosophically rather than mythologically. Various passages show that in the cosmological speculation of the Rig Veda The sun was regarded as an important agent of generation. Thus he is called the soul (atma) of all that moves and stands. Statements such as that he is called by many names though one indicate that his nature was being tentatively abstracted to that of a supreme god, nearly approaching that of the later conception of Brahma. In this sense the sun is once glorified as a great power of the universe under the name of the golden embryo, hiranya-garbha, in &quot;Rig Veda&quot;. It is he who measures out space in the air and shines where the sun rises. In the last verse of this hymn, he is called Prajapati, lord of created beings , the name which became that of the chief god of the Brahmanas. It is significant that in the only older passage of the Rig veda in which it occurs, Prajapati is an epithet of the solar deity Savitr, who in the same hymn is said to rule over what moves and stands.

===Other names and epithets===
;Apam napat (Born of the Waters): Savitr is at least once. called &quot;apam napat&quot; (Child of Waters), an epithet applied to Agni and Soma as well.

;God of the Middle Region: Commentator Yaska commenting on the verse where Savitr is attributed with causing rain, regards Savitr as belonging to the mesial region (or atmosphere) for possessing this ability, adding that the Adityas, who are in heaven, are also called Savitr. It is probably owing to this epithet and because Savitr’s paths are said to be in the atmosphere, that this deity occurs among the gods of the mesial expanse among those of outer space in the Naighantuka.

;Prajapati: Savitr is once depicted as the Prajapati of the world. In the Satapatha Brahmana (v. 12, 3, 5), Savitr has been identified with Prajapati and in the Taittiriya Brahmana (v. 1, 6, 4), it has been stated that Prajapati becoming Savitr created living beings.

;Damunas (Domestic): In the Rig Veda, Savitr has been twice spoken of as domestic (&quot;damunas&quot;), an epithet otherwise almost entirely limited to Agni.

;Asura: Like many other gods, Savitr is mentioned as ‘asura’ in many hymns of the Rig Veda.

;Pusan: Savitr alone is the lord of vivifying power and on account of his movements (yamabhih), he becomes Pusan. In two consecutive verses, Pusan and Savitr are described as connected. In the first the favour of Pusan who sees all beings is invoked, and in the second, Savitr is besought to stimulate the thoughts of worshipers who desire to think of the excellent brilliance of the Deva. The latter verse is the celebrated Savitri, now termed as the Gayatri mantra, with which Savitr was in later times invoked at the beginning of Vedic study.

;Mitra: Savitr is also said to become Mitra by reason of his laws.

;Bhaga: Savitr seems sometimes to be identified with Bhaga also, unless the latter word is here only an epithet of Savitr. The name of Bhaga, the good god bestowing benefits is indeed often added to that of Savitr so as to form the single expression Savitr Bhaga or Bhaga Savitr, with the term Bhaga simply acting as a qualitative and attributive adjective.

==Savitr in the Brahmanas==
The Vedas do not specifically identify the Ādityas as there is no classification of the thirty-three gods, except for in the Yajurveda (7.19), which says that there are eleven gods in heaven (light space), eleven gods in the atmosphere (intermediate space), and eleven gods on earth (observer space). In some passages of the Satapatha Brahmana, the number of Ādityas is eight, and in other passages twelve Ādityas are mentioned.

Savitr disappears in post-Vedic literature and is absent from the corpus of Pauranic Hinduism.

==Hindu revivalism==
Some modern Hindu spiritual thinkers assign symbolism to the Vedic deities like Savitr. The Vedic deities are not only forces of nature, but also forces that exist within the human intellect and psyche, and help the individual in spiritual progress.

According to Sri Aurobindo, the Vedic depictions are deeper than mere imagery. The gods, goddesses and the evil forces mentioned in the Vedas represent various cosmic powers. They play a significant role in the drama of creation, preservation, and destruction in the inner world of a human being.

Once the senses are controlled and the mind is stabilized through slaying of all the dark powers, comes the awakening, the goddess Ushas, who brings along with her Ashvins into the world of inner consciousness. After Ushas appears Aditi, the Primal Sun, the God of Light: First as Savitr, who represents the divine grace essential for all spiritual success, and then as Mitra, who as the divine love is considered as a friend of the illumined mind (Indra) and his associates (the other gods). The Sun is of Truth, after which appear Rta (Truth in Action) and Rtachit (Truth consciousness).

==Popular culture ==
In DC Comics&#x27; The Flash comics and The CW&#x27;s &quot;The Flash&quot; TV series, the speedster Savitar is an enemy of the Flash who named himself after the Hindu god.

In a fiction by author Ryan Sequeira, called &quot;EvOLv&quot;, where Savitr has been named as one of the Supreme Gods - parallel with Shiva - The God Savitr is referred to as the source of light in the multiverse.

In the Dark-Hunter fantasy series by author Sherrilyn Kenyon, Savitar is a Chthonian god killer who is thousands of years old and was responsible for policing the Atlantean pantheon.

For the second and all subsequent seasons of the television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, Richard Gibbs composed new opening music whose words come from the Sāvitrī Mantra. A literal translation of the verse can be given as: &quot;May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the god: so may he stimulate our prayers.&quot;

<doc id="100203" wikidata="Q6497135" url="?curid=100203" title="Mitra">
<text>Mitra (Proto-Indo-Iranian: ) is the name of an Indo-Iranian divinity that predates the Rigvedic Mitrá and Avestan Mithra.

The names, and some characteristics, of these established deities subsequently influenced other figures:
* Maitreya, a vrddhi-derived form of Sanskrit &quot;mitra&quot;, a bodhisattva in Buddhist tradition. 
* Latin Mithras, the principal figure of the first-century Roman mystery cult of Mithraism, whose name derives from the Avestan theonym via Greek and some Anatolian intermediate.
* In Hellenistic-era Asia Minor, Avestan Mithra was conflated with various local and Greek figures leading to several different variants of Apollo-Helios-Mithras-Hermes-Stilbon. 
* In Middle Iranian, the Avestan theonym evolved (among other Middle Iranian forms) into Sogdian &quot;Miši&quot;, Middle Persian and Parthian &quot;Mihr&quot;, and Bactrian &quot;Miuro&quot; (/mihru/). Aside from Avestan Mithra, these derivative names were also used for Greco-Bactrian &quot;Mithro&quot;, &quot;Miiro&quot;, &quot;Mioro&quot;, and &quot;Miuro&quot;.
* Mithra, the &quot;first messenger&quot; of Iranian Manichaeans.

==Indian religious texts==
Both Vedic Mitra and Avestan Mithra derive from an Indo-Iranian common noun &quot;*mitra-&quot;, generally reconstructed to have meant &quot;, treaty, agreement, promise.&quot; This meaning is preserved in Avestan &quot;miθra&quot; &quot;covenant&quot;. In Sanskrit and modern Indo-Aryan languages, &quot;&quot; means &quot;friend&quot;, one of the aspects of bonding and alliance.

The Indo-Iranian reconstruction is attributed to Christian Bartholomae, and was subsequently refined by A. Meillet (1907), who suggested derivation from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*mey-&quot; &quot;to exchange&quot;.

A suggested alternative derivation was &quot;*meh&quot; &quot;to measure&quot; (Gray 1929). Pokorny (IEW 1959) refined Meillet&#x27;s &quot;*mei&quot; as &quot;to bind&quot;. Combining the root &quot;*mei&quot; with the &quot;tool suffix&quot; &quot;-tra-&quot; &quot;that which [causes] ...&quot; (also found in &quot;man-tra-&quot;, &quot;that which causes to think&quot;), then literally means &quot;that which binds&quot;, and thus &quot;covenant, treaty, agreement, promise, oath&quot; etc. Pokorny&#x27;s interpretation also supports &quot;to fasten, strengthen&quot;, which may be found in Latin &quot;moenia&quot; &quot;city wall, fortification&quot;, and in an antonymic form, Old English &quot;(ge)maere&quot; &quot;border, boundary-post&quot;.

Meillet and Pokorny&#x27;s &quot;contract&quot; did however have its detractors. Lentz (1964, 1970) refused to accept abstract &quot;contract&quot; for so exalted a divinity and preferred the more religious &quot;piety&quot;. Because present-day Sanskrit &quot;mitra&quot; means &quot;friend&quot;, and New Persian &quot;mihr&quot; means &quot;love&quot; or &quot;friendship&quot;, Gonda (1972, 1973) insisted on a Vedic meaning of &quot;friend, friendship&quot;, not &quot;contract&quot;.

Meillet&#x27;s analysis also &quot;rectified earlier interpretations&quot; that suggested that the Indo-Iranian common noun &quot;*mitra-&quot; had anything to do with the light or the sun. When H. Lommel suggested that such an association was implied in the Younger Avesta (since the 6th century BCE), that too was conclusively dismissed. Today, it is certain that &quot;(al)though Miθra is closely associated with the sun in the Avesta, he is not the sun&quot; and &quot;Vedic Mitra is not either.&quot;

Old Persian &quot;Miθra&quot; or &quot;Miθra&quot; – both only attested in a handful of 4th-century BCE inscriptions of Artaxerxes II and III – &quot;is generally admitted [to be] a borrowing from the Avesta,&quot; the genuine Old Persian form being reconstructed as &quot;*Miça&quot;. (Kent initially suggested Sanskrit but later changed his mind). Middle Iranian &quot;myhr&quot; (Parthian, also in living Armenian usage) and &quot;mihr&quot; (Middle Persian), derive from Avestan &quot;Mithra&quot;. 

Greek/Latin &quot;Mithras,&quot; the focal deity of the Greco-Roman cult of Mithraism is the nominative form of vocative Mithra. In contrast to the original Avestan meaning of &quot;contract&quot; or &quot;covenant&quot; (and still evident in post-Sassanid Middle Persian texts), the Greco-Roman Mithraists probably thought the name meant &quot;mediator&quot;. In Plutarch&#x27;s 1st-century discussion of dualistic theologies, &quot;Isis and Osiris&quot; (46.7) the Greek historiographer provides the following explanation of the name in his summary of the Zoroastrian religion: Mithra is a &quot;meson&quot; (&quot;in the middle&quot;) between &quot;the good Horomazdes and the evil Aremanius [...] and this is why the &quot;Pérsai&quot; call the Mediator Mithra&quot;. Zaehner attributes this false etymology to a role that Mithra (and the sun) played in the now extinct branch of Zoroastrianism known as Zurvanism.

==Indian Mitra==
Vedic Mitra is a prominent deity of the Rigveda distinguished by a relationship to Varuna, the protector of &quot;rta&quot; as described in hymn 2, Mandala 1 of Rigveda. Together with Varuna, he counted among the Adityas, a group of solar deities, also in later Vedic texts. Vedic Mitra is the patron divinity of honesty, friendship, contracts and meetings.

The first extant record of Indo-Aryan Mitra, in the form &quot;mi-it-ra-&quot;, is in the inscribed peace treaty of c. 1400 BC between Hittites and the Hurrian kingdom of the Mitanni in the area southeast of Lake Van in Asia Minor. Mitra appears there together with four other Indic divinities as witnesses and keepers of the pact.

==Iranian Mithra==

In Zoroastrianism, Mithra is a member of the trinity of &quot;ahuras&quot;, protectors of &quot;asha/arta&quot;, &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;[that which is] right&quot;. Mithra&#x27;s standard appellation is &quot;of wide pastures&quot; suggesting omnipresence. Mithra is &quot;truth-speaking, ... with a thousand ears, ... with ten thousand eyes, high, with full knowledge, strong, sleepless, and ever awake.&quot; (&quot;Yasht&quot; 10.7). As preserver of covenants, Mithra is also protector and keeper of all aspects of interpersonal relationships, such as friendship and love.

Related to his position as protector of truth, Mithra is a judge (&quot;ratu&quot;), ensuring that individuals who break promises or are not righteous (&quot;artavan&quot;) are not admitted to paradise. As also in Indo-Iranian tradition, Mithra is associated with (the divinity of) the sun but originally distinct from it. Mithra is closely associated with the feminine yazata Aredvi Sura Anahita, the hypostasis of knowledge.

==Mithra in Commagene==
There is a deity Mithra mentioned on monuments in Commagene. According to the archaeologist Maarten Vermaseren, 1st century BC evidence from Commagene demonstrates the &quot;reverence paid to Mithras&quot; but does not refer to &quot;the mysteries&quot;.

In the colossal statuary erected by King Antiochus I (69–34 BC) at Mount Nemrut, Mithras is shown beardless, wearing a Phrygian cap,
and was originally seated on a throne alongside other deities and the king himself.
On the back of the thrones there is an inscription in Greek, which includes the name Apollo-Mithras-Helios in the genitive case ().

Vermaseren also reports about a Mithras cult in Fayum in the 3rd century BC.
R.D. Barnett has argued that the royal seal of King Saussatar of Mitanni from depicts a tauroctonous Mithras.

==Buddhist Maitreya ==

Maitreya is sometimes represented seated on a throne, and venerated both in Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna Buddhism. Some have speculated that inspiration for Maitreya may have come from the ancient Iranian deity &quot;Mithra&quot;. The primary comparison between the two characters appears to be the similarity of their names. According to Tiele (1917) &quot;No one who has studied the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyants or the coming saviour-prophets can fail to see their resemblance to the future Maitreya.&quot;

Paul Williams claims that some Zoroastrian ideas like Saoshyant influenced the beliefs about Maitreya , such as expectations of a heavenly helper, the need to opt for positive righteousness, the future millennium, and universal salvation. Possible objections are that these characteristics are not unique to Zoroastrianism, nor are they necessarily characteristic of the belief in Maitreya .

==Graeco-Roman Mithras==

The name Mithra was adopted by the Greeks and Romans as &quot;Mithras&quot;, chief figure in the mystery religion of Mithraism. At first identified with the Sun-god Helios by the Greeks, the syncretic Mithra-Helios was transformed into the figure Mithras during the 2nd century BC, probably at Pergamon. This new cult was taken to Rome around the 1st century BC and was dispersed throughout the Roman Empire. Popular among the Roman military, Mithraism was spread as far north as Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the Germanic Limes.

<doc id="100205" wikidata="Q854683" url="?curid=100205" title="Bhaga">
<text>Bhaga (), is the Vedic god of wealth, as well as a term for &quot;lord, patron&quot; and &quot;wealth, prosperity&quot;. He is an Āditya, a group of societal deities who are the sons of Aditi. Bhaga&#x27;s responsibility was to make sure that people received a share of the goods in life. He is associated with his brother, Aryaman, regarding the expectation of a successful marriage.

== Etymology ==

The cognate term in Avestan and Old Persian is &quot;&quot;, of uncertain meaning but used in a sense in which &quot;lord, patron, sharer/distributor of good fortune&quot; might also apply. The cognate in Slavic languages is the root (&quot;god&quot;). The semantics is similar to English &quot;lord&quot; (from &quot;hlaford&quot; &quot;bread-warden&quot;), the idea being that it is part of the function of a chieftain or leader to distribute riches or spoils among his followers. The name of the city of Baghdad derives from Middle Persian &quot;⁠bag-dād⁠&quot;, &quot;lord-given&quot;.

== Role ==
=== In Sanskrit religious literature ===
In the Rigveda Samhita, Bhaga is invoked and praised as the &quot;sustainer of the world&quot;, &quot;giver of wealth&quot;, &quot;chief leader of rites&quot;, and &quot;possessor of opulence&quot;. He is asked to bestow upon his adherents cattle and horses, male issue, felicity, and riches.

In the Sanskrit Rigveda, &quot;bhaga&quot; is an epithet of both mortals and gods (e.g. of Savitr, Indra and Agni) who bestow wealth and prosperity, as well as the personification of a particular god, &quot;the&quot; Bhaga, who bestows the same. In the Rigveda, the personification is attested primarily in &quot;RV&quot; 7.41, which is devoted to the praise of the Bhaga and of the deities closest to him, and in which the Bhaga is invoked about 60 times, together with Agni, Indra, the dual Mitra-Varuna, the two Ashvins, Pusan, Brahmanaspati, Soma and Rudra. Bhaga is also invoked elsewhere in the company of Indra, Varuna and Mitra (e.g. &quot;RV&quot; 10.35, 42.396). The personification is occasionally intentionally ambiguous, as in &quot;RV&quot; 5.46 where men are portrayed as requesting the Bhaga to share in &quot;bhaga&quot;. In the Rigveda, the Bhaga is occasionally associated with the sun: in &quot;RV&quot; 1.123, the Dawn (Ushas) is said to be the Bhaga&#x27;s sister, and in &quot;RV&quot; 1.136, the Bhaga&#x27;s eye is adorned with rays.

The 5th/6th-century BCE &quot;Nirukta&quot; (&quot;Nir.&quot; 12.13) describes Bhaga as the god of the morning. In the Rigveda, the Bhaga is named as one of the Adityas, the seven (or eight) celestial sons of Aditi, the Rigvedic mother of the gods. In the medieval Bhagavata Purana, the Bhaga reappears with the Puranic Adityas, which are by then twelve solar gods.

== Legacy ==
Elsewhere, the Bhaga continues as a god of wealth and marriage, in a role that is also attested for the Sogdian (Buddhist) equivalent of the Bhaga.

The common noun &quot;bhaga&quot; survives in the 2nd century CE inscription of Rudradaman I, where it is a fiscal term; in &quot;bhagavan&quot; for &quot;one who possesses (&quot;-van&quot;) the properties of a &quot;bhaga-&quot;&quot;, hence itself &quot;lord, god&quot;; and in &quot;bhagya&quot;, and &quot;that which derives from &quot;bhaga&quot;&quot;, hence &quot;destiny&quot; as an abstract noun, and also &quot;Bhagya&quot; personified as the proper name of a son of Surya.

Bhaga is also the presiding deity of the Purva Phalgunī Nakshatra.

<text>Virabhadra (), also rendered Veerabhadra, Veerabathira, and Veerabathiran, is a fierce form of the Hindu god Shiva. He is created by the wrath of Shiva, when the deity hurls a lock of his matted hair upon the ground, upon hearing of the self-immolation of his consort, Sati, at the Daksha yajna.

He appears in the Puranas as a vengeful being, attacking the deities who had attended the Daksha yajna with Bhadrakali. In the ensuing melee, Bhaga&#x27;s eyes are plucked out, Agni, Mitra, and Chandra are also accosted. The fate of Daksha himself varies from text to text: Virabhadra either decapitates him, urges him to beg forgiveness from Shiva, or is saved by Vishnu, who defeats Virabhadra.

==Legend==

=== Origin ===
Virabhadra was created by Shiva after Sati, Shiva&#x27;s wife, immolated herself during the Daksha Yajña.

The origin of the Daksha Yajña legend lies in Taittirīya Samhita 2.6.8, where Rudra (later Shiva) was excluded from the sacrifice by the Devas, then Rudra pierced the sacrifice. Pushan lost his teeth and Bhaga got blinded. This legend is also mentioned in the Shatapatha Brāhmana of the Shukla Yajurveda and in the Gopatha Brāhmana of the Atharvaveda. The Gopatha Brāhmana version mentions Prajapati as the one who excluded Rudra from the sacrifice. In post-Vedic literature, Daksha Prajapati excluded Shiva from the Yajña.

According to Shaivism, Virabhadra&#x27;s origins are described as follows: Sati was the youngest daughter of Daksha. While growing up, she had her heart set on Shiva and worshipped him. During the svayamvara of Sati, Daksha invited all the Devas and princes except Shiva. Sati cast her garland into the air, calling upon Shiva to receive it, and beheld him to be standing in the midst of the court, with the garland about his neck. Daksha had no choice but to accept the marriage of his daughter to Shiva.

One day, Daksha invited all the deities, as well as all of his children and grandchildren, in order to perform a ritual sacrifice, deliberately not inviting Sati and Shiva. Sati&#x27;s urge to attend the event, due to her affection towards her parents, overpowered the social etiquette of not going to an uninvited ceremony. When Shiva refused to accompany her, Sati insisted on attending the ritual without him. Upon her arrival, Daksha started to humiliate her and her husband, expressing his hatred for Shiva in front of the entire assembly of people. Unable to bear the ignominy, the furious Sati leapt into the sacrificial fire, immolating herself with her yogic abilities. When Shiva heard of these tidings, he tore a clump of his matted hair, from which Virabhadra and Bhadrakali emerged. Shiva instructed Virabhadra to lay waste to the sacrifice, and destroy all of its participants. Veerabhadra is a small element of Shiva. Shiva himself personally did not want to get into a violent mode. So, he took a strand of his hair and created Veerabhadra.

The Padma Purana identifies Virabhadra as the fierce form of Mangala (Mars). Virabhadra is born when Shiva, due to his anguish regarding the death of Sati, perspires, and his perspiration falls upon the earth. This gives birth to the fierce Virabhadra, who destroys the sacrifice. In the aftermath, Shiva calms him down and makes him Angaraka, the planet Mars.

=== Daksha yajna ===
The Skanda Purana states that ill-omens immediately started to surface when Shiva&#x27;s forces started to march upon the Daksha yajna, describing a rain of blood and meteor showers. Finding these phenomena to be foreboding, Daksha sought the protection of Vishnu, who agreed to offer it, while also according blame to the former for his disrespect. The forces consisted of the Navadurga, rakshasas, yakshas, pishachas, a host of bhutas, thousands of ganas, as well as yoginis and guhyakas. These forces were commanded by the three-eyed Virabhadra, bearing a thousand arms, entwined with great serpents, with his chariot drawn by two thousand horses and a million lions. Indra and the devas were assisted by Bhrigu in routing the first wave of gana attacks. Angered, Virabhadra marshalled his forces in a counterattack, and wielding their battle-axes and iron clubs, they started to massacre the devas. The sages begged Vishnu to defend the sacrifice from the attackers, and the deity prepared to fight against Virabhadra. While Virabhadra offered his obeisance to the preserver deity, he accused him of seeking a share of the offerings of the sacrifice, and warned him against staying there. Vishnu laughed, and informed him that he had a duty to shield his devotees, and would leave after he had had his fill of Virabhadra&#x27;s missiles. Indra chose to challenge Virabhadra, and struck him with his vajra. In retaliation, Virabhadra attempted to swallow Indra as well as his mount, Airavata. Vishnu intervened, saving Indra, and obstructing the assault of Virabhadra. He also summoned the Ashvins, who healed the fallen devas with their medicine. Enraged, Virabhadra confronted Vishnu. The preserver deity employed his Sudarshana Chakra against Virabhadra, which the latter swallowed whole. After retrieving his celestial discus, satisfied that he had turned the tide of the battle, Vishnu returned to his abode. Not satisfied with the carnage, Virabhadra accosted Bhrigu, Pushan, and when he saw the terrified Daksha cowering beneath the altar, he beheaded him, offering his head to the fire as a sacrifice. The disturbed Brahma visited Shiva, and begged him to put an end to the bloodshed. Shiva arrived at the Daksha yajna, conversed with Virabhadra, and restored life to Daksha by placing the head of a deformed animal upon his neck. The resurrected Daksha offered his obeisance to Shiva, which ended the conflict.

Various scriptures, coloured by their traditions, offer variations of the conflict, and Virabhadra&#x27;s role in the legend. The Kurma Purana has Virabhadra realise that Vishnu and Shiva are the same deity, and proclaim that the world was created by Narayana. In the Harivamsha and Vamana Purana, Vishnu gains the upper hand in his fight against Virabhadra.

=== Significance ===
Veerbhadra is considered gotrapurusha of many jat clans and VeeraShaiva-lingayat subsects(like lingayat vani).They believe to be originated from Shiva&#x27;s Jats and therefore worship lord virabhadra as their ancestral god. They believe in having qualities of a Kshatriya and neglect discrimination and ego (same was the purpose of virabhadra to kill daksha).

Many temples were created by rulers of veerashiva lingayat faith including the lepakshi veerbhadra temple.The temple was built in 1530 CE (1540 CE is also mentioned) by Virupanna Nayaka and Viranna, both brothers who were Governors under the Vijayanagar Empire.According to Skanda Purana, the temple is one of the &quot;divyakshetras&quot;, an important pilgrimage site of Lord Shiva.

<text>Svaha (Sanskrit: स्वाहा, IAST: Svāhā) is a Sanskrit term in Indian religions which refers to a goddess and also to a kind of incantation used in mantras and rituals.

In Hinduism, Svaha, also referred to as Manyanti, is the Hindu goddess of sacrifices featured in the Vedas. She is the consort of Agni, and the daughter of either Daksha or Brihaspati, depending on the literary tradition. According to the Brahmavaivarta Purana, she is an aspect of Prakriti (nature), an element without which Agni cannot sustain. 

Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism (including Vajrayana) both make use of &quot;Svāhā&quot; as a mantric invokation recited during rituals or as part of mantras. As a feminine noun, &quot;svāhā&quot; in the Rigveda may also mean oblation (to Agni or Indra). Svaha is also considered to mean an auspicious ending.

== Etymology ==
Etymologically, the Sanskrit term derives from the root words सू sū- &quot;good&quot; and आहा -āhā &quot;to call&quot;. 

== Invocation ==
Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism both make use of the Sanskrit word &quot;svāhā&quot; (romanized Sanskrit transcription; Devanagari: स्वाहा; Khmer: ស្វាហា; Thai: สวาหะ; Chinese: 薩婆訶, &quot;sà pó hē&quot;, Japanese: &quot;sowaka&quot;; Tibetan: སྭཱ་ཧཱ་ &quot;sw&#x27;a h&#x27;a&quot;; Korean: 사바하, &quot;sabaha&quot;; Vietnamese: ta bà ha) as a ritual or mantric invokation. The term was first used in Vedic ritual, where it was uttered during offerings to the sacred fire. With each ladle of the offering, the priest would say svāhā. The &quot;Yajur Veda&quot; contains numerous invocations structured with a deity’s name in the dative case (indicating &quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot; the deity), followed by svāhā, such as agnaye svāhā (&quot;to Agni, svāhā&quot;) and somāya svāhā (&quot;to Soma, svāhā&quot;) (see Taittirīya Saṃhitā 7.1.14.1). These formulae may have influenced the development of Buddhist mantras. &quot;Svāhā&quot; is also chanted to offer oblation to the gods. &quot;Svāhā&quot; is often included at the end of a specific mantra, which may invoked during yajna fire sacrifices, yogic practices (like japa) and worship. 

Svāhā is not technically a mantra in itself. According to Monier-Williams, its likely etymology is &quot;su&quot; (meaning good, well, whole, etc.) combined with &quot;ah&quot; (meaning to call, to say, to speak, etc.), which would render a literal meaning such as &quot;well spoken.&quot; Conze translates it as &quot;all hail,&quot; a choice followed by many other translators. He describes &quot;svāhā&quot; as a term of blessing—&quot;an ecstatic shout of joy, expressive of a feeling of complete release&quot; 

In Buddhist texts, &quot;svāhā&quot; first appears in the &quot;dhāraṇīs&quot; inserted into Mahāyāna sūtras, such as the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Golden Light Sūtra&quot;. It subsequently became a common ending for Buddhist mantras. While Conze speculates that it might indicate a feminine deity, there is no clear basis for this claim.&quot; 

== Deity ==

=== Legends ===
Svaha is personified as a goddess and as the consort of Agni. According to the Brahmavidya Upanishad, Svaha represents the shakti or power that cannot be burned by Agni. In the Upanishads, Svaha confesses to be enamoured by Agni and wishes to dwell with him. Hence, the deities state that oblations would be offered to Agni while invoking her name during hymns, allowing Svaha to dwell with Agni in perpetuity.

In some versions, she is one of the many divine mothers of Kartikeya (Skanda). She is also the mother of Agneya (Aagneya) — the daughter of Agni. She is considered to be a daughter of Daksha and his consort Prasuti. She is thought to preside over burnt offerings. Her body is said to consist of the four Vedas and her six limbs are considered to be the six Angas of the Vedas.

==== Story ====
In the &quot;Mahabharata Vana Parva&quot;, Markandeya narrates her story to the Pandavas. Svaha was the daughter of Daksha. She fell in love with the God of Fire, Agni, and was pursuing him. Agni did not notice her. He presided over the sacrificial rituals of the Saptarishis. The deity became highly besotted with the wives of the Saptarishis who were so ravishing that he kept staring at them.

Finally, Agni could not bear the guilt of longing for wives belonging to someone else and he went to the forests to perform penances. Svaha followed him and understood his desire. She took the forms of the wives of the Saptarishis (though she was unable to take the form of Arundhati, wife of Vashishtha) and approached Agni six times, seducing him and throwing the seed of each union into a golden pot, from which Skanda was born.

=== Literature ===

==== Brahmanda Purana ====
The Brahmanda Purana mentions the names of the children of Svaha: Pavamāna, Pāvaka, and Śuci.

==== Devi Bhagavata Purana ====
In the Devi Bhagavata Purana, Narayana offers Narada the procedure to meditate upon Svaha:
=== Beyond the Indian subcontinent and Hinduism ===
In Hinduism in Thailand call her Mae Phra pheling (แม่พระเพลิง) Which means goddess of Fire in Thai Language. She is generally respected along with goddess Ganga and Mae Phra phay (wife of Vayu) from Hinduism with Phra Mae Thorani and Phosop from tai folk religion, They five are usually worshipped or mentioned together., Her famous and much talked about sculptures in Thailand include Kuan Yin Inter-Religious Park Phu Sawan sub district, Kaeng Krachan district, Phetchaburi province. and Baan Sukhawadee, Sukhumvit Road, Bang Lamung district, Chonburi province.

<text>The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century&#x27;s On-Line Pioneers is a 1998 book by Tom Standage. The book was first published in September 1998 through Walker &amp; Company and discusses the development and uses of the electric telegraph during the second half of the 19th century and some of the similarities the telegraph shared with the Internet of the late 20th century.

The central thesis of the book argues that of these two technologies, it was the telegraph that was the more significant, since the ability to communicate globally at all in real-time was a qualitative shift, while according to Standage the change brought on by the modern Internet was merely a quantitative shift.

== Contents ==
The book describes to general readers how some of the uses of telegraph in commercial, military, and social communication were, in a sense, analogous to modern uses of the internet. A few rather unusual stories are related, about couples who fell in love and even married over the wires, criminals who were caught through the telegraph, and so on.
The culture which developed between telegraph operators also had some rather unexpected affinities with the modern Internet. Both cultures made or make use of complex text coding and abbreviated language slang, both required network security experts, and both attracted criminals who used the networks to commit fraud, hack private communications, and send unwanted messages.

==Reception==
Critical reception of the book was mostly positive. &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine gave a positive review for &quot;The Victorian Internet&quot;, but stated that it was &quot;not the book for readers who want in-depth accounts of the lives of scientist-inventors like Thomas Edison or Charles Wheatstone, detailed financial histories of companies like Western Union, or technical treatments of subjects like the development of semaphore systems and undersea cables&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; had some criticisms of the book but gave a mostly positive review.

<text>Devaki (Sanskrit: देवकी, IAST: &quot;Devakī&quot;) is a character in Hindu literature, most noted for being the mother of the god Krishna. She is one of the seven daughters of Devapa or Devaka, a king of the Yadu dynasty, and has four brothers. She is one of the wives of Vasudeva. Her cousin is Kamsa, the king of Mathura, a cruel tyrant who had been told by Narada that he had been an asura killed by Vishnu in his previous life (Kalanemi), exacerbating his wickedness. According to popular tradition, Devaki is considered to be an incarnation of Aditi, a mother goddess who was the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa.

==Marriage ==

During the nuptials of Vasudeva and Devaki following the former&#x27;s wedding with his bride&#x27;s six older sisters, Vishnu picked a lock of hair from his mount Shesha as well as his own, proclaiming that they would take be born as Devaki&#x27;s seventh and eighth children, respectively. After the marriage ceremony, Kamsa volunteered to escort the newly-weds to Mathura and drove their chariot. A celestial voice, an , prophesied that the eighth child of Devaki would become Kamsa&#x27;s death, and deliver the land from his wickedness. Angered, Kamsa rose to kill Devaki, but was stopped by Vasudeva, who promised to give each child to Kamsa, whom he would subsequently kill.

==Imprisonment==

Devaki and Vasudeva were imprisoned by Kamsa due to the paranoia that had taken root in the tyrant&#x27;s mind. Her six children were killed, while the seventh Balarama survived after being transferred by divine will into the uterus of Rohini, one of the other wives of Vasudeva. 

Devaki&#x27;s six dead sons were named Kírttimat, Sushena, Udayin, Bhadrasena, Rijudasa, and Bhadradeha. According to the Harivamsa, they were the reincarnations of the sons of the asura Kalanemi. They had performed intense austerities to worship the creator deity Brahma, unbeknownst to their own grandfather, Hiranyakashipu. The latter, furious at their actions, cursed them to be born on earth and be slain by Kansa, who himself was a form of their father.

Devaki soon mothered Balarama through the surrogacy of Rohini. 

When Devaki delivered Krishna, he revealed his divine form to his parents, and ordered Vasudeva to take him to Gokulam, placing all the prison guards under a spell of slumber, so that Kamsa would not realise that his prophesied killer had been born. Vasudeva swapped Krishna with Yogamaya, the daughter who had been born to Nanda and Yashoda on the very same day, and returned to the cell. 

When Kamsa stormed into the chamber after the spell had worn out, he deduced that Devaki had given birth to a girl. Devaki protested against the killing of the daughter of Nanda and Yashoda, but Kamsa hurled her against a rock, recognising that the gender of his prophesied slayer had not been specified. Yashoda&#x27;s daughter transformed into an eight-armed goddess, and stated, &quot;Fool, your destroyer has already been born elsewhere.&quot; She subsequently vanished into the heavens.

Devaki and Vasudeva&#x27;s imprisonment came to an end after Kamsa&#x27;s death.

==Salvation to the Sadgarbhas==
Devaki, upon hearing how Krishna restored his Guru Sandipani&#x27;s son, wished to see her own children. Krishna acceded her request and brought the children to Devaki from Patala. She nursed them with her milk and they attained heaven.

==Death==
After the passing of Vasudeva after the Yadu massacre, Devaki cremated herself on Vasudeva&#x27;s pyre, performing sati, along with his other wives, Rohini, Bhadra, and Madira.

==Worship ==

In the state of Goa, &quot;Devaki Krishna Sansthan&quot; temple is a unique temple, perhaps is the only temple in India where Krishna is worshiped alongside mother Devaki. The main deity Devakikrishna and affiliate deities of Bhumika Devi, Laxmi Ravalnath, Mallinath, Katyayani, Chodaneshwar and Dhada Shankar were originally located at &quot;Choodamani&quot; island (Chorão island of today). To avoid persecution during the Goa Inquisition they were taken to Mayem in Bicholim and from there shifted to the present location at Mashel. The garbhagriha (inner sanctum) of the temple has an idol of Devaki and Krishna. The idol of Devaki is in standing posture holding baby Krishna with her left hand. Mata Devaki is worshipped separately in a small temple dedicated to her inside the Dwarkadhish temple complex in Dwarka, Gujarat.

<doc id="100221" wikidata="Q890382" url="?curid=100221" title="Vasudeva">
<text>Vasudeva (; Sanskrit: वसुदेव ), also called Anakadundubhi (&quot;anakas&quot; and &quot;dundubhis&quot; both refer to &quot;drums&quot;, after the musicians who played these instruments at the time of his birth), is the father of the Hindu deities Krishna (Vāsudeva, i.e. &quot;son of Vasudeva&quot;), Balarama, and Subhadra. He was a king of the Vrishnis. The son of the Yadava king Shurasena, he was also the second cousin of Nanda, the foster-father of Krishna. His sister Kunti was married to Pandu. 

The patronymic &quot;&quot; (with a pronounced &quot;ā&quot;) is a popular name of Krishna, the son of Vasudeva and Devaki. &quot;Vāsudeva&quot; is a vṛddhi, a derivative of the short form &quot;Vasudeva&quot;, a linguistic pragmatic in Sanskrit signifying &quot;of, belonging to, descended from&quot;. &quot;Vasudeva&quot; as an object of worship in Hinduism usually refers to the son (Krishna), rather than his father Vasudeva.

==Family==
Vasudeva was born to the Yadava king Shurasena in the Surasena kingdom of Khandalwansha. Vasudeva had many brothers such as Devashrava and Devabhaga, and 5 sisters Srutakirti, Kunti, Rajadhidevi, Srutadeva (Mother of the Dantavakra), and Shrutasravas (mother of Shishupala). According to the Harivamsa Purana, Vasudeva and Nanda, the Kshatriya chief of Gokula, were brothers or cousins.

===Wives and children===
Vasudeva married Devaki, and also had other wives such as Pauravi Rohini, Madira, Vaishakhi, Bhadra, Sunama, Sahadeva, Shantideva, Shrideva, Devarakshita, Vrikadevi, Upadevi and Badarva. Rohini bore several sons, namely, Balarama, Sarana and Shatha. Vrikadevi gave birth to Avagaha and Nandaka. By Devaki, he had eight sons – six of whom were killed by Kamsa and the other two being Balarama (transferred into the womb of Rohini) and Krishna. He also had a daughter – Subhadra from Rohini. In some versions of the Bhagavata Purana, Vasudeva also married Sutanu, the princess of Kasi, and they had a son named Paundraka.

===Descendants===
Vasudeva traced a number of descendants through his sons. Sarana had many sons like Satyadhriti and Marsti, and Shatha had a son called Sarthi. Balarama married Revati and had two sons – Nishatha and Ulmuka &amp; a daughter – Vatsala/Shashirekha. Krishna had eight principal wives, and he begat many children from them, such as Pradyumna, Samba, Bhanu etc., and they also had many children. Vasudeva&#x27;s daughter Subhadra married Pandava prince Arjuna, and they had a son Abhimanyu. Ultimately, it was Abhimanyu&#x27;s son Parikshit who ascended the Kuru throne after Yudhishthira.

Many of the Yadavas killed themselves in the Yadava fratricide. Krishna, Balarama and Vasudeva later gave up their lives, and the Pandavas collected the remaining Yadava children and ladies with them to Indraprastha, where Pradyumma&#x27;s grandson Vajra was crowned as king of Mathura, and some other survivors also were crowned as kings of different places.&quot;(See Mausala Parva)&quot;.Many migrated southwards and known as &quot;vira balija&quot; or &quot;vir banajiga&quot; and created a powerful warrior merchant class of south India and ruled nayaka dynasties.
The sons of Vasudeva were related to Bhagavatism that was largely formed by the 1st-millennium BCE where &quot;Vāsudeva&quot; (Krishna, the son of Vasudeva) was worshiped as supreme ultimate reality. This is evidenced by texts and archaeological evidence. As textual evidence, the Mahanarayana Upanishad records the verse:


This verse asserts that Narayana, Vāsudeva (Krishna), and Vishnu are synonymous. The author and the century in which the above Mahanarayana Upanishad was composed is unknown. The relative chronology of the text, based on its poetic verse and textual style, has been proposed by Parmeshwaranand to the same period of composition as Katha, Isha, Mundaka and Shvetashvatara Upanishads, but before Maitri, Prashna and Mandukya Upanishad. Feuerstein places the relative composition chronology of Mahanarayana to be about that of Mundaka and Prashna Upanishads. These relative chronology estimates date the text to second half of 1st millennium BCE. Srinivasan suggests a later date for the composition of the Mahanarayana Upanishad, one after about 300 BCE and probably in the centuries around the start of the common era.

Other evidence is from archeological inscriptions, where &quot;Bhagavan&quot; is documented epigraphically to be from around 100 BCE, such as in the inscriptions of the Heliodorus pillar. An Indo-Greek ambassador from Taxila named Heliodorus, of this era, visited the court of a Shunga king, and addresses himself as a Bhagavata on this pillar, an epithet scholars consider as evidence of Vāsudeva worship was well established in 1st millennium BCE. A popular short prayer for worshipping Vāsudeva is Dwadashaakshar.

==Kashyapa incarnated as Vasudeva==
Sage Kashyapa is said to have incarnated as Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, due to a curse of the deities Varuna or Brahma. 

Once, the sage is said to have performed a yajna (a ritual sacrifice) in his hermitage. Kashyapa sought the help of the god Varuna for the offerings of milk and ghee. Varuna lent the sage a divine cow that would provide him the required offerings. After completing the sacrifice, Kashyapa delayed in returning the cow back to the deity. Varuna cursed the sage and his wife, Aditi, to be born on earth as Vasudeva and Devaki, the parents of Vishnu in his avatar of Krishna.

In other iterations, Kashyapa is stated to have stolen a divine cow from Varuna for the performance of a ritual sacrifice. The deity requested Brahma for his intervention. For his theft of a cow, Brahma cursed Kashyapa to be born on earth as a cowherd. Since his wives, Aditi and Surasa, had assisted him in concealing the cows in his hermitage, they were also born on earth as his two wives, Devaki and Rohini.

<doc id="100224" wikidata="Q78491" url="?curid=100224" title="Stefan Zweig">
<text>Stefan Zweig ( , ; 28 November 1881 – 22 February 1942) was an Austrian writer. At the height of his literary career, in the 1920s and 1930s, he was one of the most widely translated and popular writers in the world.

Zweig was raised in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. He wrote historical studies of famous literary figures, such as Honoré de Balzac, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoevsky in &quot;Drei Meister&quot; (1920; &quot;Three Masters&quot;), and decisive historical events in &quot;Decisive Moments in History&quot; (1927). He wrote biographies of Joseph Fouché (1929), Mary Stuart (1935) and Marie Antoinette (&quot;Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman&quot;, 1932), among others. Zweig&#x27;s best-known fiction includes &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; (1922), &quot;Amok&quot; (1922), &quot;Fear&quot; (1925), &quot;Confusion of Feelings&quot; (1927), &quot;Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman&quot; (1927), the psychological novel &quot;Ungeduld des Herzens&quot; (&quot;Beware of Pity&quot;, 1939), and &quot;The Royal Game&quot; (1941).

In 1934, as a result of the Nazi Party&#x27;s rise in Germany and the establishment of the &quot;Ständestaat&quot; regime in Austria, Zweig emigrated to England and then, in 1940, moved briefly to New York and then to Brazil, where he settled. In his final years, he would declare himself in love with the country, writing about it in the book &quot;Brazil, Land of the Future&quot;. Nonetheless, as the years passed Zweig became increasingly disillusioned and despairing at the future of Europe, and he and his wife Lotte were found dead of a barbiturate overdose in their house in Petrópolis on 23 February 1942; they had died the previous day. His work has been the basis for several film adaptations. Zweig&#x27;s memoir, (&quot;The World of Yesterday&quot;, 1942), is noted for its description of life during the waning years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire under Franz Joseph I and has been called the most famous book on the Habsburg Empire.

== Biography ==

Zweig was born in Vienna, the son of Ida Brettauer (1854–1938), a daughter of a Jewish banking family, and Moritz Zweig (1845–1926), a wealthy Jewish textile manufacturer. He was related to the Czech writer Egon Hostovský, who described him as &quot;a very distant relative&quot;; some sources describe them as cousins.

Zweig studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and in 1904 earned a doctoral degree with a thesis on &quot;The Philosophy of Hippolyte Taine&quot;. Religion did not play a central role in his education. &quot;My mother and father were Jewish only through accident of birth&quot;, Zweig said in an interview. Yet he did not renounce his Jewish faith and wrote repeatedly on Jews and Jewish themes, as in his story &quot;Buchmendel&quot;. Zweig had a warm relationship with Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, whom he met when Herzl was still literary editor of the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;, then Vienna&#x27;s main newspaper; Herzl accepted for publication some of Zweig&#x27;s early essays. Zweig, a committed cosmopolitan, believed in internationalism and in Europeanism, as &quot;The World of Yesterday&quot;, his autobiography, makes clear: &quot;I was sure in my heart from the first of my identity as a citizen of the world.&quot; According to Amos Elon, Zweig called Herzl&#x27;s book an &quot;obtuse text, [a] piece of nonsense&quot;.

Zweig served in the Archives of the Ministry of War and supported Austria&#x27;s effort for war through his writings in the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; and frequently celebrated in his &quot;Diaries&quot; the capture and massacre of opposing soldiers (for instance, writing about the innumerable citizens killed at gunpoint under the suspicion of espionage that &quot;what filth has made ooze must be cauterized with scalding iron&quot;.) Zweig judged Serbian soldiers as &quot;hordes&quot; and stated that &quot;one feels proud to talk German&quot; when thousands of French soldiers were captured in Metz. Conversely, in his memoirs, &quot;The World of Yesterday&quot;, Zweig portrays himself in the role of pacifist at the time of the First World War, states that he refused &quot;to participate in those rabid calumnies against the enemy&quot; (although, through his work in the official &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;, Zweig promoted the war propaganda issued from the Austrian crown) and affirms that among his intellectual friends he was &quot;alone&quot; in his stance against the war.

Zweig married Friderike Maria von Winternitz (born Burger) in 1920; they divorced in 1938. As Friderike Zweig she published a book on her former husband after his death. She later also published a picture book on Zweig. In the late summer of 1939, Zweig married his secretary Elisabet Charlotte &quot;Lotte&quot; Altmann in Bath, England. Zweig&#x27;s secretary in Salzburg from November 1919 to March 1938 was Anna Meingast (13 May 1881, Vienna – 17 November 1953, Salzburg).


As a Jew, Zweig&#x27;s high profile did not shield him from the threat of persecution. In 1934, following Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany and the establishment of the &quot;Ständestaat&quot;, an authoritarian political regime now known as &quot;Austrofascism&quot;, Zweig left Austria for England, living first in London, then from 1939 in Bath. Because of the swift advance of Hitler&#x27;s troops westwards, and the threat of arrest or worse – as part of the preparations for Operation Seelöwe a list of persons to be detained immediately after conquest of the British Isles, the so-called &quot;Black Book&quot;, had been assembled and Zweig was on page 231, with his London address fully mentioned – Zweig and his second wife crossed the Atlantic to the United States, settling in 1940 in New York City; they lived for two months as guests of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, before renting a house in Ossining, New York.

On 22 August 1940, they moved again to Petrópolis, a German-colonized mountain town 68 kilometres north of Rio de Janeiro. There, he wrote the book &quot;Brazil, Land of the Future&quot; and developed a close friendship with Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral. Zweig, feeling increasingly depressed about the situation in Europe and the future for humanity, wrote in a letter to author Jules Romains, &quot;My inner crisis consists in that I am not able to identify myself with the me of passport, the self of exile&quot;. He had been despairing at the future of Europe and its culture. He wrote: &quot;I think it better to conclude in good time and in erect bearing a life in which intellectual labour meant the purest joy and personal freedom the highest good on Earth&quot;. On 23 February 1942, the Zweigs were found dead of a barbiturate overdose in their house in the city of Petrópolis, holding hands. The Zweigs&#x27; house in Brazil was later turned into a cultural centre and is now known as Casa Stefan Zweig.

== Work ==
Zweig was a prominent writer in the 1920s and 1930s, befriending Arthur Schnitzler and Sigmund Freud. He was extremely popular in the United States, South America and Europe, and remains so in continental Europe; however, he was largely ignored by the British public. His fame in America had diminished until the 1990s, when there began an effort on the part of several publishers (notably Pushkin Press, Hesperus Press, and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;) to get Zweig back into print in English. Plunkett Lake Press has reissued electronic versions of his non-fiction works. Since that time there has been a marked resurgence and a number of Zweig&#x27;s books are back in print.

Critical opinion of his oeuvre is strongly divided between those who praise his humanism, simplicity and effective style, and those who criticize his literary style as poor, lightweight and superficial. In a review entitled &quot;Vermicular Dither&quot;, German polemicist Michael Hofmann scathingly attacked the Austrian&#x27;s work. Hofmann opined that &quot;Zweig just tastes fake. He&#x27;s the Pepsi of Austrian writing.&quot; Even the author&#x27;s suicide note, Hofmann suggested, induces &quot;the irritable rise of boredom halfway through it, and the sense that &quot;he doesn&#x27;t mean it&quot;, his heart isn&#x27;t in it (not even in his suicide)&quot;.

Zweig is best known for his novellas (notably &quot;The Royal Game&quot;, &quot;Amok&quot;, and &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; – which was filmed in 1948 by Max Ophüls), novels (&quot;Beware of Pity&quot;, &quot;Confusion of Feelings&quot;, and the posthumously published &quot;The Post Office Girl&quot;) and biographies (notably of Erasmus of Rotterdam, Ferdinand Magellan, and Mary, Queen of Scots, and also the posthumously published one on Balzac). At one time his works were published without his consent in English under the pseudonym &quot;Stephen Branch&quot; (a translation of his real name) when anti-German sentiment was running high. His 1932 biography of Queen Marie Antoinette was adapted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a 1938 film starring Norma Shearer.

Zweig&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The World of Yesterday&quot;, was completed in 1942 one day before he died by suicide. It has been widely discussed as a record of &quot;what it meant to be alive between 1881 and 1942&quot; in central Europe; the book has attracted both critical praise and hostile dismissal.
Zweig acknowledged his debt to psychoanalysis. In a letter dated 8 September 1926, he wrote to Freud, &quot;Psychology is the great business of my life&quot;. He went on explaining that Freud had considerable influence on writers such as Marcel Proust, D.H. Lawrence and James Joyce, giving them a lesson in &quot;courage&quot; and helping them to overcome their inhibitions. &quot;Thanks to you, we &quot;see&quot; many things. – Thanks to you we &quot;say&quot; many things which otherwise we would not have seen nor said.&quot; He claimed autobiography, in particular, had become &quot;more clear-sighted and audacious&quot;.

Zweig enjoyed a close association with Richard Strauss and provided the libretto for &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot; (&quot;The Silent Woman&quot;). Strauss famously defied the Nazi regime by refusing to sanction the removal of Zweig&#x27;s name from the programme for the work&#x27;s première on 24 June 1935 in Dresden. As a result, Goebbels refused to attend as planned, and the opera was banned after three performances. Zweig later collaborated with Joseph Gregor to provide Strauss with the libretto for one other opera, &quot;Friedenstag&quot;, in 1938. At least one other work by Zweig received a musical setting: the pianist and composer Henry Jolles, who like Zweig had fled to Brazil to escape the Nazis, composed a song, &quot;Último poema de Stefan Zweig&quot;, based on &quot;Letztes Gedicht&quot;, which Zweig wrote on the occasion of his 60th birthday in November 1941. During his stay in Brazil, Zweig wrote &quot;Brasilien, Ein Land der Zukunft&quot; (&quot;Brazil, A Land of the Future&quot;) which consisted in a collection of essays on the history and culture of his newly adopted country.

Zweig was a passionate collector of manuscripts. He corresponded at length with Hungarian musicologist Gisela Selden-Goth, often discussing their shared interest in collecting original music scores. There are important Zweig collections at the British Library, at the State University of New York at Fredonia and at the National Library of Israel. The British Library&#x27;s Stefan Zweig Collection was donated to the library by his heirs in May 1986. It specialises in autograph music manuscripts, including works by Bach, Haydn, Wagner, and Mahler. It has been described as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s greatest collections of autograph manuscripts&quot;. One particularly precious item is Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Verzeichnüß aller meiner Werke&quot; – that is, the composer&#x27;s own handwritten thematic catalogue of his works.

The 1993–1994 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.

Zweig has been credited with being one of the novelists who contributed to the emergence of what would later be called the Habsburg myth.

Friedenthal wrote that &quot;Balzac&quot; &quot;was to be his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, and he had been working at it for ten years. It was to be a summing up of his own experience as an author and of what life had taught him.&quot; Friedenthal claimed that &quot;The book had been finished&quot;, though not every chapter was complete; he used a working copy of the manuscript Zweig left behind him to apply &quot;the finishing touches&quot;, and Friedenthal rewrote the final chapters (&quot;Balzac&quot;, translated by William and Dorothy Rose [New York: Viking, 1946], pp. 399, 402).

== Adaptations ==
The 1933 Austrian-German drama film &quot;The Burning Secret&quot; directed by Robert Siodmak was based on Zweig&#x27;s short story &quot;Brennendes Geheimnis.&quot; The 1988 remake of the same film &quot;Burning Secret&quot; was directed by Andrew Birkin and starred Klaus Maria Brandauer and Faye Dunaway.

&quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; was filmed in 1948 by Max Ophüls.

&quot;Beware of Pity&quot; was adapted into a 1946 film with the same title, directed by Maurice Elvey.

&quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; was filmed in 1962 by Salah Abu Seif.

An adaptation by Stephen Wyatt of &quot;Beware of Pity&quot; was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in 2011.

The 2012 Brazilian film &quot;The Invisible Collection&quot;, directed by Bernard Attal, is based on Zweig&#x27;s short story of the same title.

The 2013 French film &quot;A Promise&quot; (&#x27;) is based on Zweig&#x27;s novella &quot;Journey into the Past&quot; (&#x27;).

The 2013 Swiss film &quot;Mary Queen of Scots,&quot; directed by Thomas Imbach, is based on Zweig&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuart&quot;.

The end-credits for Wes Anderson&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; say that the film was inspired in part by Zweig&#x27;s novels. Anderson said that he had &quot;stolen&quot; from Zweig&#x27;s novels &quot;Beware of Pity&quot; and &quot;The Post-Office Girl&quot; in writing the film, and it features actors Tom Wilkinson as The Author, a character based loosely on Zweig, and Jude Law as his younger, idealised self seen in flashbacks. Anderson also said that the film&#x27;s protagonist, the concierge Gustave H., played by Ralph Fiennes, was based on Zweig. In the film&#x27;s opening sequence, a teenage girl visits a shrine for The Author, which includes a bust of him wearing Zweig-like spectacles and celebrated as his country&#x27;s &quot;National Treasure&quot;.

The 2017 Austrian-German-French film &quot;Vor der Morgenröte&quot; (&quot;Stefan Zweig: Farewell to Europe&quot;) chronicles Stefan Zweig&#x27;s travels in the North and South Americas, trying to come to terms with his exile from home.

The 2018 American short film &quot;Crepúsculo&quot; by Clemy Clarke is based on Zweig&#x27;s short story &quot;A Story Told in Twilight&quot; and relocated to a quinceañera in 1980s New York.

TV film &quot;La Ruelle au clair de lune&quot; (1988) by Édouard Molinaro is an adaptation of Zweig&#x27;s short-story &quot;Moonbeam Alley&quot;.

&quot;Schachnovelle&quot;, translated as &quot;The Royal Game&quot; and as &quot;Chess Story&quot;, was the inspiration for the 1960 Gerd Oswald film &quot;Brainwashed&quot;, as well as for two Czechoslovakian films—the 1980 &quot;Královská hra&quot; (&quot;The Royal Game&quot;) and &quot;Šach mat (Checkmate),&quot; made for television in 1964—and for the 2021 Philipp Stölzl film &quot;Chess Story&quot;.

<doc id="100225" wikidata="Q113904" url="?curid=100225" title="Radha">
<text>Radha (, ), also called Radhika, is a Hindu goddess and the chief consort of the god Krishna. She is the goddess of love, tenderness, compassion, and devotion. In scriptures, Radha is mentioned as the avatar of Lakshmi and also as the Mūlaprakriti, the Supreme goddess, who is the feminine counterpart and internal potency (&quot;hladini shakti&quot;) of Krishna. Radha accompanies Krishna in all his incarnations. Radha&#x27;s birthday is celebrated every year on the occasion of Radhashtami.

In relation with Krishna, Radha has dual representation—the lover consort as well as his married consort. Traditions like Nimbarka Sampradaya worship Radha as the eternal consort and wedded wife of Krishna. In contrast, traditions like Gaudiya Vaishnavism revere her as Krishna&#x27;s lover and the divine consort. 

In Radha Vallabha Sampradaya and Haridasi Sampradaya, only Radha is worshipped as the Supreme being. Elsewhere, she is venerated with Krishna as his principal consort in Nimbarka Sampradaya, Pushtimarg, Mahanam Sampradaya, Swaminarayan Sampradaya, Vaishnava-Sahajiya, Manipuri Vaishnavism, and Gaudiya Vaishnavism movements linked to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

Radha is described as the chief of &quot;Braj Gopis&quot; (milkmaids of Braj) and queen of Goloka and Braj including Vrindavan and Barsana. She has inspired numerous literary works, and her Raslila dance with Krishna has inspired many types of performance arts.

== Etymology and epithets ==

The Sanskrit term () means &quot;prosperity, success, perfection and wealth&quot;. It is a common word and name found in various contexts in the ancient and medieval texts of India. The word appears in the Vedic literature as well as the Hindu epics, but is elusive. The name also appears for a figure in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Rādhikā refers to an endearing form of Radha.

In chapter 15th, &quot;Goloka khanda&quot; of &quot;Garga Samhita&quot;, Sage Garga elaborates the complete meaning of Radha. In Radha, &#x27;R&#x27; signifies &quot;Rama&quot;, goddess Lakshmi, &#x27;a&#x27; means &quot;Gopis&quot;, &quot;dh&quot; signifies &quot;dhara&quot;, goddess Bhudevi and last &#x27;a&#x27; symbolises &quot;River&quot; &quot;Virājā&quot; (also called &quot;Yamuna&quot;).

The fifth chapter, &quot;Fifth night&quot; of &quot;Narada Pancharatra&quot; mentioned 1008 names of Radha under the title &quot;Shri Radha Saharsnama Strotam&quot;. The 68th chapter, &quot;Tritiya paad&quot; of &quot;Narada Purana&quot; also listed 500 names of Radha. Some of the common names and epithets are:

* &quot;Sri&quot;, &quot;Shreeji&quot;, &quot;Shriji&quot;: Goddess of radiance, splendor and wealth; Lakshmi
* &quot;Madhavi&quot;: Feminine counterpart of Madhava
* &quot;Keshavi&quot;: Feminine form of Keshava
* &quot;Aparajita&quot;: She who is unconquerable
* &quot;Kishori&quot;: Youthful
* &quot;Nitya&quot;: She is eternal
* &quot;Nitya-gehinī&quot;: Krishna&#x27;s eternal wife
* &quot;Gopi&quot;: Cowherd girl
* &quot;Shyama&quot;: Beloved of Shyam
* &quot;Gaurangi&quot;: She whose complexion is bright like the lustrous gold
* &quot;Raseshvari&quot; and &quot;Rasa-priya&quot;: Queen of Raslila and she who is fond of rasa dance
* &quot;Vrindavaneshvari&quot;: Queen of Vrindavan
* &quot;Krishneshvari&quot;: Feminine counterpart of Krishna

== Literature and symbolism ==
Radha is an important goddess in the Vaishnavite traditions of Hinduism. Her traits, manifestations, descriptions, and roles vary by region. Radha is intrinsic with Krishna. In early Indian literature, mentions of her are elusive. The traditions that venerate her explain this is because she is the secret treasure hidden within the sacred scriptures. During the Bhakti movement era in the sixteenth century, she became more well known as her extraordinary love for Krishna was highlighted.

Radha&#x27;s first major appearance in the 12th-century &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; in Sanskrit by Jayadeva, as well as Nimbarkacharya&#x27;s philosophical works. Thus in the &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; Krishna speaks to Radha:
However, the source of Jayadeva&#x27;s heroine in his poem remains a puzzle of the Sanskrit literature. A possible explanation is Jayadeva&#x27;s friendship with Nimbarkacharya, the first acharya to establish the worship of Radha-Krishna. Nimbarka, in accordance with the Sahitya Akademi&#x27;s Encyclopaedia, more than any other acharyas gave Radha a place as a deity.

Prior to Gita Govinda, Radha was also mentioned in text &quot;Gatha Saptasati&quot; which is a collection of 700 verses composed in Prakrit language by King Hāla. The text was written around first or second century AD. Gatha Saptasati mentioned Radha explicitly in its verse:

Radha also appears in the Puranas namely the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; (as an avatar of Lakshmi), the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot; (as a form of Mahadevi), the &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; (as Radha-Krishna supreme deity), the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; (as form of Devi), the &quot;Linga Purana&quot; (as form of Lakshmi), the &quot;Varaha Purana&quot; (as consort of Krishna), the Narada Purana (as goddess of love), the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;. The 15th and 16th century Krishnaite Bhakti poet-saints Vidyapati, Chandidas, Meera Bai, Surdas, Swami Haridas, as well as Narsinh Mehta (1350–1450), who preceded all of them, wrote about the romance of Krishna and Radha too. Thus, Chandidas in his Bengali-language &quot;Shri Krishna Kirtana&quot;, a poem of Bhakti, depicts Radha and Krishna as divine, but in human love. Though not named in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Visvanatha Chakravarti (c. 1626–1708) interprets an unnamed favourite gopi in the scripture as Radha. She makes appearances in &quot;Venisamhara&quot; by Bhatta Narayana (c. 800 CE), &quot;Dhvanyaloka&quot; by Anandavardhana (c. 820–890 CE) and its commentary &quot;Dhvanyalokalocana&quot; by Abhinavagupta (c. 950 – 1016 CE), Rajasekhara&#x27;s (late ninth-early tenth century) Kāvyamīmāṃsā, &quot;Dashavatara-charita&quot; (1066 CE) by Kshemendra and &quot;Siddhahemasabdanusana&quot; by Hemachandra (c. 1088–1172). In most of these, Radha is depicted as someone who is deeply in love with Krishna and is deeply saddened when Krishna leaves her. But, on contrary, Radha of the &quot;Rādhātantram&quot; is portrayed as audacious, sassy, confident, omniscient and divine personality who is in full control at all times. In &quot;Rādhātantram,&quot; Radha is not merely the consort but is treated as the independent goddess. Here, Krishna is portrayed as her disciple and Radha as his guru.
Charlotte Vaudeville theorizes that Radha may have inspired by the pairing of the goddess Ekanamsha (associated with Durga) with Jagannatha (who is identified with Krishna) of Puri in Eastern India. Though Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (15th century, the founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism) is not known to have worshiped the deity couple of Radha-Krishna, his disciples around the Vrindavan region, affirmed Radha as the &quot;hladini shakti&quot; (&quot;energy of bliss&quot;) of Krishna, associating her with the Primordial Divine Mother. While the poetry of Jayadeva and Vidyapati from Bengal treat Radha as Krishna&#x27;s beloved, the Gaudiya poetry elevates her to a divine consort. In Western India, Vallabhacharya&#x27;s Krishna-centric sampradaya Pushtimarg, Radha is revered as the &quot;Swamini&quot; of Krishna, who is worthy of devotion.

According to Jaya Chemburkar, there are at least two significant and different aspects of Radha in the literature associated with her, such as &quot;Sri Radhika namasahasram&quot;. One aspect is she is a milkmaid (gopi), another as a female deity similar to those found in the Hindu goddess traditions. She also appears in Hindu arts as &quot;Ardhanari&quot; with Krishna, that is an iconography where half of the image is Radha and the other half is Krishna. This is found in sculpture such as those discovered in Maharashtra, and in texts such as &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; and &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot;. In these texts, this &quot;Ardha Nari&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;Ardharadhavenudhara murti&quot;, and it symbolizes the complete union and inseparability of Radha and Krishna.

D.M. Wulff demonstrates through a close study of her Sanskrit and Bengali sources that Radha is both the &quot;consort&quot; and &quot;conqueror&quot; of Krishna and that &quot;metaphysically Radha is understood as co-substantial and co-eternal with Krishna.&quot; Indeed, the more popular vernacular traditions prefer to worship the couple and often tilt the balance of power towards Radha.

Graham M. Schweig in his work &quot;The divine feminine theology of Krishna&quot; in context with Radha Krishna stated that, &quot;The divine couple, Radha and Krishna, comprise the essence of godhead. Radha is therefore acknowledged by Chaitanyaite Vaishnavas to be part of very center of their theological doctrine. Sacred images of the forms of Radha Krishna, standing together side by side, are elaborately worshiped in the Indian temples. Through her image, her divine character and her amorous and passionate relations with Krishna, Radha is the constant meditation of practitioners.

According to William Archer and David Kinsley, a professor of Religious Studies known for his studies on Hindu goddesses, the Radha-Krishna love story is a metaphor for a divine-human relationship, where Radha is the human devotee or soul who is frustrated with the past, obligations to social expectations, and the ideas she inherited, who then longs for real meaning, the true love, the divine (Krishna). This metaphoric Radha (soul) finds new liberation in learning more about Krishna, bonding in devotion, and with passion.

An image of Radha has inspired numerous literary works. For modern instance, the &quot;Shri Radhacharita Mahakavyam&quot;—the 1980s epic poem of Dr. Kalika Prasad Shukla that focuses on Radha&#x27;s devotion to Krishna as the universal lover—&quot;one of the rare, high-quality works in Sanskrit in the twentieth century.&quot;

=== Radha and Sita ===
The Radha-Krishna and Sita-Rama pairs represent two different personality sets, two perspectives on dharma and lifestyles, both cherished in the way of life called Hinduism. Sita is traditionally wedded: the dedicated and virtuous wife of Rama, an introspective temperate paragon of a serious, virtuous man. Radha is a power potency of Krishna, who is a playful adventurer.

Radha and Sita offer two templates within the Hindu tradition. If &quot;Sita is a queen, aware of her social responsibilities&quot;, states Pauwels, then &quot;Radha is exclusively focused on her romantic relationship with her lover&quot;, giving two contrasting role models from two ends of the moral universe. Yet they share common elements as well. Both face life challenges and are committed to their true love. They are both influential, adored and beloved goddesses in the Hindu culture.

In worship of Rama, Sita is represented as a dutiful and loving wife, holding a position entirely subordinate to Rama. However, in the worship of Radha Krishna, Radha is often preferred over to Krishna, and in certain traditions, her name is elevated to a higher position compared to Krishna&#x27;s.

== Iconography ==

Radha in Hinduism, is revered as the goddess of love. She is mostly depicted along with Krishna or gopis in the land of Braj. Various art forms based on Radha Krishna are majorly inspired by &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; and &quot;Rasikapriya&quot;. In Rajput paintings, Radha represents an ideal of beauty, wearing the traditional sari decorated extensively with patterns and ornamented in jewelry with lighter skin tone and emphasized facial features. In Kishangarh paintings, Radha is represented as beautifully dressed woman in &quot;ghagra choli&quot; with pearl jewelry and a dark diaphanous veil over her head. The famous Bani Thani portrait by artist Nihâl Chand was inspired by Radha&#x27;s physical features which includes sharp eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes, thin lips and a pointed nose and chin. 

In religious art forms, Radha also appears as &quot;Ardhanari&quot; with Krishna, that is an iconography where half of the image is Radha and the other half is Krishna forming the combined masculine and feminine form of Ardhanarishvara.

In Radha Krishna temples, Radha stands on the left of Krishna, with a garland in her hand. She is often dressed in traditional sari or &quot;ghagra-choli&quot; along with a veil. Her jewelry from top to bottom is either made of metals, pearls or flowers.

The Sanskrit scripture &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; describes Radha as the beautiful and youthful goddess having the molten golden complexion and wearing the garlands of gems and flowers.

== Life and legends ==
Radha in her human form is revered as the milkmaid (gopi) of Vrindavan who became the beloved of Krishna. One of the basic traits of Radha is her unconditional love for Krishna and her sufferings that forms the basis for Radha&#x27;s exaltation as a model of devotion.

=== Birth and early life ===
Radha was born to Vrishbhanu, who was the Yadava ruler of Barsana and his wife Kirtida. Her birthplace is Raval which is a small town near Gokul in Uttar pradesh, but is often said to be Barsana where she grew up. According to popular legend, Radha was discovered by Vrishbhanu on an effulgent lotus floating in Yamuna river. Radha was nine months older than Krishna. She didn&#x27;t open her eyes until Krishna himself in his child form appeared in front of her.

&quot;Ashtasakhis&quot; (translated to eight friends) are the integral part of Radha&#x27;s childhood and youth. It is believed that all the &quot;Ashtasakhis&quot; are the intimate friends of Radha Krishna and also have descended from Goloka in Braj region. Out of all the eight sakhis, Lalita and Vishakha are the prominent ones. According to Chaitanya Charitamrita&#x27;s Antya lila (2:6:116), Radha also received a boon from sage Durvasa in her childhood that whatever she cooks would be better than the nectar.

===Youth===

Stories of Radha&#x27;s youth are filled with her divine pastimes with Krishna. Some of the popular pastimes of Radha Krishna include: &quot;Raslila&quot;, pastimes of &quot;Radha Kund&quot;, &quot;Gopashtami lila&quot;, &quot;Lathmar Holi&quot;, &quot;Seva Kunj lila&quot; in which Krishna did sringara of Radha, &quot;Maan lila&quot; ( A special stage in divine love in which the devotee develops so much love for God as to even attain the right of getting angry with him), &quot;Mor Kutir lila&quot; in which Krishna performed a dance lila by dressing himself as a peacock to please Radha, &quot;Gopadevi lila&quot; (Krishna took form of female to meet Radha) and &quot;Lilahava&quot; in which Radha Krishna dressed in each other clothes.

==== Relationship with Krishna ====
Radha and Krishna share two kinds of relationships, Parakiya (Love without any social limitation) and Svakiya (married relationship). Radha asked Krishna why he can&#x27;t marry her, the reply came &quot;Marriage is a union of two souls. You and I are one soul, how can I marry myself?&quot; Several Hindu texts allude to these circumstances.
The Sanskrit texts, &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; and the &quot;Garga Samhita&quot; mention that Krishna secretly married Radha in the presence of Brahma in the &quot;Bhandirvan&quot; forest before leaving Vrindavan. The place where Radha Krishna&#x27;s marriage was conducted is still present in the outskirts of Vrindavan, called Radha Krishna Vivah Sthali, Bhandirvan. The story mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana indicates that Radha has always been Krishna&#x27;s divine consort. But to give importance to Parakiya relationship (love without any social foundation) over Svakiya&#x27;s (married relationship), Radha Krishna&#x27;s marriage was kept hidden.

=== Life after Krishna left Vrindavan ===
According to &quot;Garga Samhita&quot; and &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot;, Radha also left her home post Krishna&#x27;s departure and went to Kadli vann (forest) leaving behind her illusionary form (also called &quot;Chaya Radha,&quot; her shadow) in Barsana. Radha with Ashtasakhi also met Uddhava in this forest who delivered them Krishna&#x27;s message.

=== Reuniting with Krishna ===
It is mentioned in Brahma Vaivarta Purana (&quot;Krishnajanma Khanda, Chapter 96&quot;) and Garga Samhita (&quot;Ashvamedha Khanda, Chapter 41&quot;) that after the curse of 100 years of separation ran out, Krishna revisited Braj and met Radha and gopis. After performing the divine pastimes for sometime, Krishna summoned a huge divine chariot which took the residents of Braj along with Radha and gopis back to their celestial abode Goloka where the final reunion of Radha Krishna took place.

== As Supreme Goddess ==
In &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot;, Radha (or Rādhikā), who is inseparable from Krishna, appears as the main goddess. She is mentioned as the personification of the Mūlaprakriti, the &quot;Root nature&quot;, that original seed from which all material forms evolved. In the company of the Purusha (&quot;Man&quot;, &quot;Spirit&quot;, &quot;Universal soul&quot;) Krishna, she is said to inhabit the Goloka, which is a world of cows and cowherds far above the Vishnu&#x27;s Vaikuntha. In this divine world, Krishna and Radha relate to one another in the way body relates to the soul. (4.6.216)

According to Krishnaism, Radha is the chief female deity and is associated with Krishna&#x27;s maya (material energy) and prakriti (feminine energy). At highest level Goloka, Radha is said to be united with Krishna and abiding with him in the same body. The relationship between Radha Krishna is that of substance and attribute: they are as inseparable as Milk and its whiteness or Earth and its smell. This level of Radha&#x27;s identity transcends her material nature as prakriti and exits in the form of pure consciousness (Narada Purana, Uttara Khana - 59.8). While Radha is identical to Krishna at this highest level, this merger of identities seems to end when she separates from him. After separation she manifest herself as the goddess Primordial prakriti (Mūlaprakriti) who is called the &quot;Maker of Universe&quot; or &quot;Mother of All&quot; (Narada Purana, Purva-Khanda, 83.10-11, 83.44, 82.214).

In Nimbarkacharya&#x27;s &quot;Vedanta Kamadhenu Dashashloki&quot; (verse 6), it is clearly stated that:
In the hymnal &quot;Hita-Caurasi&quot; of Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu, the 16th-century bhakti poet-saint, founder of Radha Vallabh Sampradaya, Radharani is exalted to the status of the only ultimate deity, while her consort Krishna is just her most intimate subordinate. As a precursor to this view can be understand Jayadeva, in whose &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; (10.9) Krishna is beneath Radha.

Radha is also considered as the personification of Krishna&#x27;s love. According to doctrines attributed to Vaishnavite saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, It is said that, Krishna has three powers: the internal which is intelligence, the external which generates appearances and the differentiated which forms the individual soul. His chief power is that which creates dilatation of the heart or joy. This appears to be the power of love. When this love becomes settled in the heart of the devotee, it constitutes &quot;Mahabhava&quot;, or the best feeling. When love attains to the highest pitch, it constitutes itself into Radha, who is the most lovable of all and full of all qualities. She was the object of the highest love of Krishna and being idealized as love, some of the agreeable feelings of the heart are considered her ornaments.

In Narada Pancharatra Samhita, Radha is mentioned as the feminine form of Krishna. It is described that, the one single lord is represented to have become two—one a woman and the other a man. Krishna retained his form of man while the female form became Radha. Radha is said to have come out from primordial body of Krishna, forming his left side, and is eternally associated with him in his amorous sports in this world as well as the world of cows (Goloka).

Radha is often identified with the &quot;sweet&quot; aspect of goddess Lakshmi&#x27;s essence and thus also worshiped as an avatara of Lakshmi. In &quot;Shri Daivakrita Lakshmi Strotam&quot;, Lakshmi is praised and glorified in her form of Radha

According to the &quot;Garga Samhita&quot; (Canto 2, chapter 22, verses 26–29), during the rasa pastime, on the request of gopis, Radha and Krishna showed them their eight armed forms and turned into their Lakshmi Narayan forms. (2.22.26) 

In &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; (Vaishnava Khand, chapter 128), Yamuna describes Radha as the soul of Krishna. She emphasis that &quot;Radha is Krishna and Krishna is Radha&quot; and all the queens of Krishna including Rukmini are the expansion of Radha.

== Portrayal ==

=== As Krishna&#x27;s lover consort (Parakiya rasa) ===
Radha is admired as an ideal of perfect lover. In Gita Govinda, it is not certain whether Radha was married or if she was an unmarried maiden. But, the relationship between Radha Krishna was unfolded in the secrecy of Vrindavan forest hinting at the &quot;Parakiya rasa.&quot; This can be understood from the verse where Nanda, the father of Krishna, who represents social authority and ideal of dharma ordered Radha Krishna to go home as storm was approaching Vrindavan but the order was defied by the couple. The translation of first verse of Gita Govinda is as follows:

In the Gita govinda, Radha stands in relation to Krishna as his consort. She is neither a wife nor a devoted rustic playmate. She is an intense, solitary, proud figure who is addressed as &quot;Sri, Candi, Manini, Bhamini&quot; and &quot;Kaamini&quot;. She is portrayed as Krishna&#x27;s partner in a mature and exclusive love.

In Vidyapati&#x27;s work, Radha is depicted as a young girl barely twelve years old, while Krishna is depicted slightly older than her and as an aggressive lover. In the work of poet Chandidas, Radha is depicted as a bold woman who is unafraid of social consequences. Radha abandons all social propriety in the name of her love for Krishna. Excerpts of Chandidas&#x27;s work showing Radha&#x27;s boldness:

In loving Krishna, Radha violates the basis of caste, showing no care for the realities of social structures. Love consumed her to extent that once having fair complexion, Radha turned herself into Krishna&#x27;s dark color. Chandidas used the word &quot;fire&quot; as synonym for Radha&#x27;s love towards Krishna. The Radha of Chandidas is favored by Gaudiya Vaishnavas.

=== As Krishna&#x27;s married consort (Svakiya rasa) ===
&quot;Rasikapriya&quot;, a Braj text on poetics depicts Radha as the married consort of Krishna. It is a frequently illustrated text that deals with the Radha Krishna&#x27;s romance and is written by one of the most prominent writers of the &quot;Riti kavya&quot; tradition, Kesavdas. Changes in the portrayal of Radha, as articulated in the Rasikapriya, have significant implications for later literary traditions. In the &quot;Riti kavya&quot; literature, especially the &quot;Rasikapriya&quot;, Radha is depicted as the archetypal heroine and is used to exemplify the ideal form of connection to Krishna. Rather than depicting her as a &quot;parakiya&quot; heroine, Kesavdas, on the whole, presents her as a &quot;svakiya&quot; heroine, the one to whom Krishna belongs wholeheartedly. If she is separated from him, it is only temporarily, for as archetypal lovers they are connected forever. The suggestion that Radha is Krishna&#x27;s rightful wife is clearly articulated in the first chapter in the exemplary verse for the manifest form of union. Here, Kesavdas compares the union of Radha and Krishna with that of Sita and Rama. Kesavdas compares the union of Radha and Krishna with that of Sita and Rama:

In this verse, Kesavdas connects Radha with Krishna as his legitimate wife not only in this lifetime but even in the previous one. Chapter 3 and verse 34 of &quot;Rasikapriya&quot;, depicted Radha as &quot;Madhya arudhayovana nayika&quot; and is described as a beautiful woman who looks like a heavenly damsel, with perfect features (forehead like the half moon, arches like a perfect bow, etc.), golden body, and a beautiful body fragrance. In chapter 3, verse 38, one attendant talks to another:

In chapter 3, verse 38, Radha is very specifically described as the wife of Krishna. In most of the verses, whenever she is mentioned by name, she is usually seen as a virtuous court lady with utmost beauty and charm. Her husband Krishna is said to be in control of her love. Kesavdasa in &quot;Rasikapriya&quot; mentioned that while it is common to see women devoted to their husbands but it is not as common to see a husband as Krishna who is so devoted to his wife Radha and considering her as goddess.(VII, 6) In Sanskrit scripture &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana,&quot; Radha and Krishna are understood to be eternally related to each other as husband and wife validating their Svakiya relationship. The celebrated poets of Radha Vallabh Sampradaya, Dhruva Dasa and Rupalji composed &quot;Vyahulau Utsav ke Pad&quot; or &quot;Marriage Festival songs&quot; which describe the eternal wedding of Radha and Krishna with praise and adulation. In the Indian state of Maharashtra, Radha is often identified as Rahi, a regional form of Radha who is worshiped as the married consort of Vithoba, a regional form of Krishna.

== Worship and festivals ==

Friedhelm Hardy singles out such an offshoot of Krishnaism as Radha-centered stream Radhaism. The main representative of which is the Radha Vallabh Sampradaya (lit. &quot;consort of Radha&quot;), where goddess Radha is worshipped as the supreme deity, and Krishna is in a subordinate position.

During the 18th century at Kolkata existed the Sakhībhāvakas community, whose members used to wear female dresses in order to identify themselves with the gopis, companions of Radha.

In some devotional (bhakti) Krishnaite traditions of Vaishnavism that focus on Krishna, Radha represents &quot;the feeling of love towards Krishna&quot;. For some of the adherents of these traditions, her importance approaches or even exceeds that of Krishna. Radha is worshipped along with Krishna in Nepal and many Indian states including West Bengal, Manipur, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Elsewhere, she is a revered deity. In Maharashtra region, Radha is worshipped in her regional form as Rahi. Radha is considered as Krishna&#x27;s original shakti, the supreme goddess in both the Nimbarka Sampradaya and following the advent of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu also within the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. Nimbarka was the first well known Vaishnava scholar whose theology centered on goddess Radha.

Since 15th century in Bengal and Assam flourished Tantric Vaishnava-Sahajiya tradition with related to it Bauls, where Krishna is the inner divine aspect of man and Radha is the aspect of woman, what incorporated into their specific sexual Maithuna ritual.

Radha&#x27;s connection to Krishna is of two types: &quot;svakiya-rasa&quot; (married relationship) and &quot;parakiya-rasa&quot; (a relationship signified with eternal mental &quot;love&quot;). The Gaudiya tradition focuses upon &quot;parakiya-rasa&quot; as the highest form of love, wherein Radha and Krishna share thoughts even through separation. The love the gopis feel for Krishna is also described in this esoteric manner as the highest platform of spontaneous love of God, and not of a sexual nature.

=== Festivals ===
Radha is one of the major and celebrated goddess in Hinduism. Following is the list of festivals associated with her.

==== Radhashtami ====

Radhashtami, also called Radha Jayanti is celebrated as the appearance anniversary of Radha. In the Hindu calendar, Radhashtami is observed annually in the month of the Bhadra, 15 days after Krishna Janmashtami, the birth anniversary of Krishna, which suggests that Radha is very much an aspect of the cultural-religious faith system governing social life. The festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor especially in the Braj region. The festivities include fasting till afternoon (12 pm), abhishek and aarti of Radharani, offering her flowers, sweets and food items, singing songs, dancing and prayers dedicated to Radha. The Radha Rani Temple in Barsana host this festival in a grand manner as Basana is also considered as the birthplace of Radha. Apart from Barsana, this festival is celebrated in nearly all the temples of Vrindavan and ISKCON temples across the world as it is one of the major festival for many Vaishnavism sections.

==== Holi ====

Holi, one of the major Hindu festival, also called &quot;festival of love&quot; and &quot;festival of colors&quot; also celebrates the divine and eternal love of Radha and Krishna. Mathura and Vrindavan are known for their Holi celebrations. According to popular legend associated with Radha Krishna, as a child, Krishna would cry to his mother Yashoda about Radha being fair while he had a dark complexion. His mother then advised him to smear colour of his choice on Radha&#x27;s face, thus giving birth to Braj ki Holi. It is said that every year, Lord Krishna would travel from his village Nandgaon to Goddess Radha&#x27;s village Barsana, where Radha and the gopis would playfully beat him with sticks. In present times, Holi celebrations in Barsana begin one week before the actual date of the festival, moving to Nandgaon the next day. In Mathura and Vrindavan, the festival is celebrated in different forms like Lathmar Holi in Barsana and Nandgaon, where sticks are used to create playful beats, to which young men and women dance; Phoolon wali Holi in Gulaal Kund near the Govardhan Hill, during which Ras Leela is performed and Holi is played with colourful flowers and Widow&#x27;s Holi in Vrindavan.

==== Sharad Purnima ====
Sharad Purnima refers to the full moon of the autumn season. On this day, devotees celebrate Krishna performing a beautiful dance called &quot;rasa lila&quot; with Radha and the gopis—the cowherd damsels of Vrindavan. On this day, Radha Krishna in temples are dressed in white outfits and are adorned with flower garlands and glittering ornaments.

==== Kartik Purnima ====
In Vaishnavism, the occasion of Kartik Purnima is considered as the most auspicious day to worship goddess Radha. According to Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Krishna also worshiped Radha on this day. In Radha Krishna temples, sacred vow is observed throughout the Karthik month and performances of Raslila are organized to celebrate this festival.

== In Shaktism ==
In Shaktism section of Hinduism, Radha becomes an independent goddess &quot;Prakriti&quot;-&quot;Padmini&quot;, who is the form of goddess Tripura Sundari while her consort Krishna is associated with the masculine form of goddess Kali. Tantric text &quot;Radha Tantra&quot;, portrayed Radha as the &quot;Shakta Radha&quot; who is also the spiritual mentor of Krishna. In Shaktism, the &quot;Ashtasakhis&quot; of Radha Krishna are considered as the embodiment of the &quot;Ashta Siddhis&quot; which are Aṇimā, Mahima, Garima, Laghima, Prāpti, Prākāmya, Iṣiṭva, and Vaśitva.

== Influence ==
=== Paintings ===
Radha and Krishna have inspired many forms of performance arts and literary works. Over the centuries, their love has been portrayed in thousands of exquisite paintings which depicts the lover in separation and union, longing and abandonment.

Patta chitra, is one of the typical regional arts of the coastal state of Orissa. In this type of painting, Krishna is depicted in blue or black color and is usually accompanied by his fiancée Radha. Rajasthani art emerged as an amalgamation of folk art with conventional and canonical ethos. Krishna and Radha have been the pivotal figures in Rajasthani miniature paintings. Their love has been delineated aesthetically in this composition. In Pahari paintings, often the nayaka (hero) is depicted as Krishna and the nayika (heroine) is depicted as Radha. The legend of Krishna and Radha and their love provided rich material to Pahari painters in general and to the artists of Garhwal in particular. The central theme of Kangra painting is love inspired by &quot;Rasikapriya,&quot; popular poetic work of Keshavdasa. A closely related theme of this art is lover looking at his beloved who is unaware of his presence. Thus, Krishna is shown watching Radha who is unaware of his presence. In Radha and Krishna, Kangra artists discovered highest model of loving couple. The Radha-Krishna theme also served their devotional purpose and provided an inherent symbolism. Madhubani paintings are charismatic art of Bihar. Madhubani paintings are mostly based on religion and mythology. In the paintings, Hindu Gods like Radha-Krishna and Shiva-Parvati are in center. Krishna and Radha are one of the favorite subject in Rajput paintings because they portrayed a theme that symbolized the desire of the soul to be united by god. In Rajput paintings, Radha is always dressed in more elegant way. She was adorned with ornaments and is often depicted holding a white garland when enthroned next to Krishna. The Chamba paintings of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab often depicts romantic ambiances of rainy season with Radha Krishna as the lead couple.

=== Dance forms ===
The most famous Indian classical dance Manipuri Raas Leela was first introduced by King Bhagyachandra around 1779. Inspired by Radha Krishna&#x27;s raslila, the king introduced three forms of rasa dance—Maha rasa, Kunj rasa and Basant rasa. Later two more forms of rasa—Nitya rasa and Deba rasa was added by successive kings in the art and culture of Manipur. In these dance forms, the dancers portray the role of Radha, Krishna and gopis. The dance forms are still prevalent in the state of Manipur and are performed on stage as well as on the auspicious occasions like Kartik Purnima and Sharad Purnima (full moon nights).

Another Indian classical dance form, Kathakali was also influenced by Vaishnavism and Radha Krishna based Gita Govinda tradition which along with other factors contributed in the evolution of this dance form. The predominant theme of North Indian Kathak dancing lies in the fleeting appearances and longer stories of Radha and Krishna. The sacred love of Krishna and his beloved Radha, are woven into all aspects of the Kathak dance and is clearly visible during the discussions of the music, costumes and finally the role of the Kathak dancer.

Ashtapadis of Gita Govinda are also enacted in contemporary classical Odissi dance form. This dance form was originated in the temples. It is centered on the celestial love of Krishna and Radha. At one time, it was performed by the Devadasis but now it has spread out to the homes and cultural institutions.

=== Music ===
&quot;Rasiya&quot; is a popular genre of Indian folk music from Braj region, Uttar Pradesh. It is commonly played and performed during the festivities in the villages and temples of Braj area. The traditional songs of &quot;Rasiya&quot; are based on the divine portrayal and love of Radha and Krishna. They are frequently written from the female perspective of Radha and portray Krishna and his flirtation with her.

=== Culture ===
The residents of Braj region still greet each other with salutations like &quot;&quot;Radhe Radhe&quot;, &quot;Jai Shri Radhe&quot; and &quot;Radhe Shyam&quot;&quot;, directing their mind to Radha and ultimate relationship she shares with Krishna. The image of Krishna rarely appears without Radha by his side in the temples of Vrindavan. It is not the Krishna who is worshiped, but Radha and Krishna together are worshiped.

In culture of Odisha, Krishna is the cultural hero and his form Jagannath, is the symbol of Oriya pride. His consort Radha is celebrated as the energy of Krishna and symbolically the energy of the cosmos. She is considered as the power of joy, the hladini shakti of Krishna and is often identified with both Durga and Mahakali, the bright and dark forms of the cosmic energy. Krishna and Radha have entered the Oriya psyche and have inspired the mythic imagination of the Oriya poets in a big way. For the conscious and the informed, Krishna and Radha are the Universe and its harmony, the Energy and its joyful articulation, the cosmic dance and its rhythmic balance.

In Indian culture, Radha serve as an exemplary model of female-neutral subjectivity for all persons—an active, non-substantial, shared and strong self that rationally embrace their (religious) passions.

<text>Yashoda (, ) is the foster-mother of Krishna and the wife of Nanda. She is described in the Puranic texts of Hinduism as the wife of Nanda, the chieftain of Gokulam, and the sister of Rohini. According to the Bhagavata Purana, Krishna was born to Devaki, but Krishna&#x27;s father, Vasudeva, brought the newborn Krishna to his cousin Nanda, and his wife, Yashoda, in Gokulam. This was for his upbringing, as well as to protect Krishna from Devaki&#x27;s brother, Kamsa, the tyrannical king of Mathura.

== Etymology ==

The name Yashoda means &#x27;one who is giver (da, ) of fame or glory (Yash, )&#x27;. 

==Legends==

=== Origin ===
According to the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Yashoda was the incarnation of Dhara, the wife of the vasu, Drona. Little is known about Yashoda&#x27;s early life, other than her marriage with Nanda.

Kamsa, the ruler of Mathura, had decided to kill Krishna as soon as he was born. In order to protect Krishna from Kamsa, Krishna and Yogamaya were born at the same time from the wombs of Devaki and Yashoda, respectively, and were exchanged by Vasudeva Anakadundubhi. Krishna survived and was raised as the foster-son of Yashoda.

Various childhood episodes or &quot;lilas&quot;, growing up in Yashoda&#x27;s household, abound in Hindu texts. In the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Yashoda is praised as:
=== Witnessing the Cosmos in Krishna&#x27;s Mouth ===
The Bhagavata Purana describes the following episode:
=== Liberation of Nalakuvara and Manigriva ===
According to the Bhagavata Purana, once, Krishna was playing in the sand and was swallowing it. Yashoda, upon seeing this, was furious with Krishna for disobeying her and punished him by tying him to a mortar, or a grinding stone. The child dragged the mortar to the tree called &quot;Marutru&quot;, and got himself struck between the twin trees. Immediately, the trees regained their original forms of Nalakuvara and Manigriva, the sons of Kubera. The deities had been cursed by Narada for not paying heed to him, and had been liberated from their curse as trees after meeting Krishna. They paid homage to the child, who blessed them, and the two returned to Vaishravanapuri.

=== Slaying of Putana ===
When the demoness Putana attempts to murder the infant Krishna by breastfeeding him with her poison, Krishna sucks out her life force instead, turning her into a carcass. Hearing the demoness&#x27; dying screams, Yashoda finds the corpse still bearing her child in her arms. Yashoda snatches him and waves a cow-tail brush over him, in order to guard him from harm.

=== Reincarnation of Yashoda ===

According to regional tradition, in the &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot;, Yashoda could not witness the wedding of Krishna. Krishna promised her that she would get that chance of seeing his wedding when Krishna incarnates again as Venkateshvara in the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;. In the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, Yashoda was born as Vakula Devi, as the mother of Venkateshvara and witnessed the nuptials between Venkateshvara and Princess Padmavathi.

* Rohini
* Krishna Janmashtami
* Nanda
* Yadu
* Kamsa

==In popular culture==
The 1975 Telugu film &quot;Yashoda Krishna&quot;, directed by C. S. Rao, presented events in the life of Krishna and his attachment towards Yashoda. Sridevi played the role of the child Krishna in the film.

The Tamil devotional song, &#x27;Enna Thavam Seithanai&#x27; is addressed to Yashoda, rhetorically wondering what penance she had performed to raise Krishna as her own child. The Carnatic song, &quot;Thaaye Yashoda&quot;, composed by Oothukkadu Venkata Kavi, is another song addressed to Yashoda from the perspective of gopikas who complain about Krishna&#x27;s mischief.

<text>Ravana Dashagriva was a king of the island of Lanka, and the chief antagonist in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; in which he was considered as a Rakshasa (demon). In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Ravana is described as the eldest son of sage Vishrava and Kaikasi. He abducted Rama&#x27;s wife, Sita, and took her to his kingdom of Lanka, where he held her in the Ashoka Vatika. Rama, with the support of vanara King Sugriva and his army of varanasi, launched a rescue operation for Sita against Ravana in Lanka. Ravana was subsequently slain, and Rama rescued his beloved wife Sita.

Ravana was well-versed in the six shastras and the four Vedas, including the Shiva Tandava Stotra. Ravana is also considered to be the most revered devotee of Shiva. Images of Ravana are often seen associated with Shiva at temples. He also appears in the Buddhist Mahayana text Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, in Buddhist Jatakas, as well as in Jain Ramayanas. In Vaishnava scriptures, he is depicted as one of Vishnu&#x27;s cursed doorkeepers.

== Etymology ==

The word Rāvaṇa (Sanskrit: रावण) means &quot;Roaring&quot; (active), the opposite of Vaiśravaṇa which means to &quot;hear distinctly&quot; (passive). Both Ravana and Vaiśravaṇa, who is commonly known as Kubera, are considered to be patronymics derived from &quot;sons of Vishrava&quot;.

Ravana was a title later taken on by Dashānana, and it means &quot;the one with ten (dasha) faces (anana)&quot;. Further, roravana is Sanskrit for &quot;loud roaring.&quot; In Abhinava Gupta&#x27;s Krama Shaiva scripture, yāsām rāvanam is used as an expression to mean people who are truly aware of the materialism of their environment.

Ravana has many other popular names such as Dasis Ravana, Dasis Sakvithi Maha Ravana, Dashaanan, Ravula, Lankapati, Lankeshwar, Lankeshwaran, Ravanasura and Ravanaeshwaran.

== Iconography ==
Ravana is depicted and described as having ten heads, although he is sometimes shown with only nine heads since he cut one off to convince Shiva. He is described as a devout follower of Shiva, a great scholar, a capable ruler, and a maestro of the Veena. Ravana is also depicted as the author of the &quot;Ravana Samhita&quot;, a book on Hindu astrology, and the &quot;Arka Prakasham&quot;, a book on Siddha medicine and treatment. Ravana possessed a thorough knowledge of Siddha and political science. In some later versions, he is said to have possessed the nectar of immortality, which was stored inside his belly thanks to a celestial boon from Brahma. In the War with Lord Rama, Ravana was killed by a powerful Brahma&#x27;s weapon shot by Rama which was gifted to Rama by Sage Agstya.

== Life and legends ==
=== Birth ===

Ravana was born to the Brahmin sage Vishrava and the Rakshasa princess Kaikasi in Treta Yuga. Villagers from Bisrakh in Uttar Pradesh claim that Bisrakh was named after Vishrava, and that Ravana was born there.

Ravana&#x27;s paternal grandfather, the sage Pulastya, was one of the ten Prajapatis, or mind-born sons of Brahma, and one of the Saptarishi (seven great sages) in the first Manvantara (age of Manu). His maternal grandfather was Sumali (or Sumalaya), the king of the Rakshasas and the son of Sukesha. Sumali had ten sons and four daughters. Sumali wished for Kaikasi to marry the most powerful being in the mortal world, so as to produce an exceptional heir. He rejected the kings of the world, as they were less powerful than him. Kaikasi searched among the sages and finally chose Vishrava, the father of Kubera. Ravana and his siblings were born to the couple and they completed their education from their father, with Ravana being a great scholar of the Vedas.

=== Boon from Brahma ===
Ravana and his two brothers, Kumbhakarna and Vibhishana, performed penance on Mount Gokarna for 10,000 years and won boons from Brahma. Ravana was blessed with a boon that would make him invincible to all the creations of Brahma, except for humans. He also received weapons, a chariot, as well as the ability to shapeshift from Brahma. According to the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, demigods approached Brahma since Ravana was causing harm on Earth. Lord Vishnu appeared and gave blessings that he will incarnate as a human (Rama) and kill Ravana since his invincibility boon did not include humans.

=== Devotee of Shiva ===
One of the most popular images of Shiva is called &quot;Ravananugraha&quot;, which was popular in the Gupta era. It depicts Ravana beneath Mount Kailash playing a veena made out of his head and hands, and strings made out of his tendons, while Shiva and Parvati sit on top of the mountain. According to scriptures, Ravana once tried to lift Mount Kailash, but Shiva pushed the mountain into place and trapped Ravana beneath it. For a thousand years, the imprisoned Ravana sang Shiva Tandava Stotra, a hymn in praise of Shiva, who finally blessed him and granted him an invincible sword and a powerful linga (Shiva&#x27;s iconic symbol, Atmalinga) to worship. But this incident has little to no evidence in Valmiki Ramayana.

=== Family ===
Ravana&#x27;s parents were the sage Vishrava (son of Pulastya) and Kaikesi (daughter of Sumali and Ketumati). Ravana had seventeen maternal uncles and three maternal aunts. Dhumraksha, Prahastha, Akampana, Vajramushti, Suparshwa and Virupaksha, a few of his maternal uncles, were generals in the Lanka army. Kaikesi&#x27;s father, Sumali and uncle, Malyavan were instrumental in making Ravana the king of Lanka by advising him to receive boons from Brahma, defeat Kubera, and establish rakshasa rule in the three worlds.

Ravana&#x27;s granduncle was Malyavan, who opposed the war with Rama and Lakshmana. He also had another granduncle named Mali who was killed by Vishnu.

Ravana had 2 full brothers, 8 half brothers, 1 full sister and 3 half sisters.

Ravana had three wives, Mandodari, the daughter of the celestial architect Maya, Dhanyamalini, and a third wife. His sons from his three wives were Meghanada, Atikaya, Akshayakumara, Narantaka, Devantaka and Trishira.

=== Priestly ministers ===
In some accounts, Ravana is said to have had Shukracharya, the priest of the Asuras, as his minister, and in other accounts, Brihaspati, the priest of the Devas.

One account narrates how Ravana ordered Brihaspati to recite the Chandi stava (mantras of Chandi), more specifically the Devi Mahatmya, in order to stave off defeat. According to the Krttivasa text, Ravana arranged for a peaceful yajna, and invited Brihaspati to start the recitation of Chandi.

== Other legends ==
=== Vishnu&#x27;s cursed doorkeeper ===
In the Bhagavata Purana, Ravana and his brother Kumbhakarna are said to be reincarnations of Jaya and Vijaya, gatekeepers at Vaikuntha (the abode of Vishnu), and were cursed to be born on Earth for their insolence.

These gatekeepers refused entry to the Sanatha Kumara monks who, because of their powers and austerity, appeared as young children. For their insolence, the monks cursed them to be expelled from Vaikuntha and to be born on Earth.

Vishnu agreed that they should be punished and gave them two options. First, that they could be born seven times as normal mortals and devotees of Vishnu, or be born three times as strong and powerful beings, but as enemies of Vishnu. Eager to be back with the Lord, they chose the latter option. The curse of the first birth was fulfilled by Hiranyakashipu and his brother Hiranyaksha in Satya Yuga, when they were both vanquished by earlier avatars of Vishnu (Hiranyaksha by Varaha, and Hiranyakashipu by Narasimha). Ravana and his brother Kumbhakarna were born to fulfill the curse in their second birth as enemies of Vishnu in Treta Yuga. The curse of the third birth was fulfilled by Dantavakra and Shishupala in the Dvapara Yuga, when they both were slain by Krishna, the eighth avatar.

=== Other conflicts ===

Ravana had fought with the demons named Nivatakavacha along with his army for an entire year but was unable to kill them due to Brahma&#x27;s boon. The war was stopped by Brahma and Ravana formed an alliance with them, he learnt several magical tricks or maya from those demons.

Ravana had defeated the vanara warriors namely Hanuman, Sugriva, Neela and even Rama&#x27;s brother Lakshmana twice during his war with Rama. As per the original six books of Valmiki Ramayana, only lord Rama the incarnation of Vishnu defeated Ravana and killed him after several days of single duel.

Once, upon hearing a discourse from Sage Sanatkumara, Ravana attempted to invade Vaikuntha. Only Ravana managed to enter Vaikuntha&#x27;s capital, Shwetadwipa, where he was hopelessly outmatched by the inhabitants and was forced to retreat.

He killed Anaranya, the king of Ayodhya, although he cursed Ravana to be slain by Rama.

Ravana had wrestled his brother Kubera and vanquished him for the Pushpaka Vimana.

He also fought Marutta (Chakravarti King of Ushiraviga), Gadhi (Vishwamitra&#x27;s father), Dushyanta (Bharata&#x27;s father), Suratha (King of Vidarbha), Gaya (Chakravarti king of Dharmaranya), and Paurava (King of Anga).

=== Rape of Rambha ===
Ravana is regarded to have once caught sight of the apsara Rambha and was filled with lust. Even as the apsara resisted his advances by asserting that she was his daughter-in-law, he raped her. When she reported this to her husband, Nalakuvara, he cursed Ravana to be unable to cause violence to any woman who did not consent to being with him, his head splitting into a number of pieces if he did so. This incident is stated to explain why Ravana could not force the abducted Sita to submit to his desire.

== Worship and temples ==
=== Worship ===
Ravana is worshipped as one of Shiva&#x27;s most revered followers, and he is even worshipped in some Shiva temples.

Ravana is worshipped by the Kanyakubja Brahmins of the Vidisha region, who see him as a savior and a sign of prosperity, claiming Ravana was also a Kanyakubja Brahmin. Thousands of Kanyakubja Brahmins of the village Ravangram of Netaran, in the Vidisha District of Madhya Pradesh, perform daily puja in the Ravana temple and offer naivedyam or bhog (a ritual of sacrifice to the gods).

King Shiv Shankar built a Ravana temple in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The Ravana temple is open once a year, on the day of Dashera, to perform puja for the welfare of Ravana.

Ravana is also worshipped by Hindus of Bisrakh, who claim their town to be his birthplace.

The Sachora Brahmins of Gujarat claim to be descendants of Ravana, and sometimes have &quot;Ravan&quot; as their surnames.

Saraswat Brahmins from Mathura claim Ravana as a saraswat Brahmin as per his lineage.

There has also been reference to &quot;Ravani&quot;, the lineage of Upadhyaya Yasastrata II, who was of the Gautama gotra and Acharya Vasudatta&#x27;s son, and described as &quot;born of Ravani&quot;.

The Gondi people of central India claim to be descendants of Ravana, and have temples for him, his wife Mandodari, and their son Meghnad. They also state that Ravana was an ancient Gond king, the tenth &quot;dharmaguru&quot; of their tribe, and the eighteenth lingo (divine teacher). Annually on Dussehra, the Gondis from the village of Paraswadi carry an image of Ravana riding on an elephant in a procession.

=== Temples ===
The following temples in India are for Ravana as a Shiva Bhakta.
* Dashanan Temple, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh
* Ravana Temple, Bisrakh, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh
* Kakinada Ravana Temple, Andhra Pradesh
* Ravangram Ravana Temple, Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh
* Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh

== Influence on culture and art ==

=== Ravana-Dahan (burning effigy of Ravana) ===

Effigies of Ravana are burned on Vijayadashami in many places throughout India to symbolize Rama&#x27;s triumph over evil.

=== Ravanahatha ===
According to mythology, the &quot;ravanahatha&quot;, an ancient bowed string instrument, was created by Ravana and is still used as a Rajasthani folk instrument.

== In other religions ==

In the Rin-spuns-pa Tibetan Ramayana, it is prophesied that Ravana will return as the Buddha incarnation of Vishnu in Kali Yuga.
The Arunachal Pradesh Tai Khamti Ramayana (Phra Chow Lamang) shows Rama as a Bodhisattva who was reborn so Ravana could torture him.
In the Laotian Buddhist text Phra Lak Phra Lam, Rama is a Bodhisattva and the embodiment of virtues, while Ravana is a Brahmin (&quot;mahabrahma&quot;) son of Virulaha who is highly materialistic.
In the Cambodian Buddhist text Preah Ream, Buddha is an incarnation of Rama and Ravana is a rakshasa.
In the Thai Buddhist text Ramakien, Ravana is a rakshasa known as &quot;Thotsakan&quot; (ทศกัณฐ์, from Sanskrit दशकण्ठ, Daśakaṇṭha, &quot;ten necks&quot;), and is depicted with green skin.
In the Karandavyuha Sutra, Yama asks if the visitor in hell (Avalokitesvara), whom he hasn&#x27;t seen yet, is a god or a demon, and whether he is Vishnu, Mahesvara, or the rakshasa Ravana.

=== Jainism ===
Jain accounts vary from the traditional Hindu accounts of the Ramayana. The incidents are placed at the time of the 20th Tirthankara, Munisuvrata. In Jainism, both Rama and Ravana were devout Jains. Ravana was a Vidyadhara king who had magical powers, and Lakshmana, not Rama, was the one who ultimately killed Ravana.

=== Dravidian movement ===
Pulavar Kuzhanthai&#x27;s Ravana Kaaviyam is a panegyric on Ravana that is made up of 3,100 poetic stanzas in which Ravana is the hero. The book was released in 1946, and was subsequently banned by India&#x27;s Congress led government. The ban was later lifted in 1971.

==In popular culture==
Sri Lanka named its first satellite Raavana 1 after Ravana.

Ravana appears as the primary antagonist in films and television series based on the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Movies like &quot;Bhakta Ravana&quot; (1938) and its Telugu (1940 and 1958) and Kannada (1958) adaptations as well as television series &quot;Raavan&quot; (2006-2008) are focused on the tale on Ravana. The Tamil film &quot;Raavanan&quot; (2010) and its Hindi counterpart &quot;Raavan&quot; (2010) narrate the epic from Ravana&#x27;s perspective in a modern setting.

Author Amish Tripathi&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;&quot; chronicles the life of Ravana until the time he kidnaps Sita. It is the third book in Tripathi&#x27;s Ram Chandra Series.

Hardeep Singh portrayed him in the 2024 Hindi film &quot;Singham Again&quot;.
