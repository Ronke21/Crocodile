<text>Lilies of the Field is a 1963 American comedy-drama film directed and produced by Ralph Nelson, adapted by James Poe from William Edmund Barrett’s 1962 novel of the same name. Starring Sidney Poitier, Lilia Skala, Stanley Adams, and Dan Frazer, the film takes its title from the Bible’s Sermon on the Mount ( and ). The story follows Homer Smith, an itinerant handyman, who encounters a group of East German nuns in the Arizona desert. Led by the determined Mother Maria Marthe, the nuns believe Homer has been sent by God to build them a chapel.

Praised by critics, the film earned five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for Skala. Poitier won the Academy Award for Best Actor, becoming the first Black actor to win in a leading role and the second Black actor overall to receive an Oscar after Hattie McDaniel. The film also features an early score by Jerry Goldsmith. In 2020, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film was turned into a Broadway musical in 1970, &quot;Look to the Lilies&quot;, with Shirley Booth starring as Mother Maria Marthe.

==Plot==
Homer Smith, a drifting handyman, stops at a remote Arizona farm seeking water for his car. He encounters a group of Eastern European nuns—led by the stern Mother Maria Marthe—struggling to maintain their modest desert homestead. Though initially resistant, Homer agrees to repair their roof in exchange for payment. The nuns, who speak little English, humorously dub him “Schmidt” (the German equivalent of Smith) and invite him to stay for meals, slowly endearing themselves to him.

When Homer demands payment, Mother Maria deflects by quoting the Bible’s Sermon on the Mount (“Consider the lilies of the field…”), urging faith over materialism. Homer counters with (“The laborer is worthy of his hire”), but her resolve remains unshaken. Through interactions with locals, including Juan, a café owner, and a traveling priest, Homer learns of the nuns’ harrowing escape from behind the Iron Curtain and their impoverished existence. Despite their inability to pay, he begrudgingly prolongs his stay, lured by the challenge of building a chapel for the nearby Mexican American community, whose nearest church is miles away.

Homer’s initial reluctance gives way to ambition when he confesses his unrealized dream of becoming an architect. Using donated materials and his dwindling savings, he begins constructing the chapel single-handedly, insisting on perfection. Tensions flare with Mother Maria, who prioritizes pragmatism over his ideals, leading Homer to abandon the project temporarily. He returns hungover but remorseful, finding renewed purpose as the community gradually rallies to assist. Locals donate supplies and labor, transforming Homer’s solitary endeavor into a collective effort, though he initially resists their involvement.

As construction progresses, Homer’s leadership earns respect, even from Ashton, a dismissive contractor who later offers him a job. The chapel’s completion culminates in a bittersweet victory: Homer secretly signs his work, symbolizing pride and humility. On the eve of the dedication, Mother Maria subtly implores him to stay, but Homer, aware their partnership has reached its natural end, departs quietly at nightfall. The nuns’ echoing rendition of “Amen”—a hymn they learned from him—underscores their unspoken gratitude as he drives away.

The film closes with “Amen” in lieu of “The End.”

==Cast==
==Production==
The movie was filmed primarily on a ranch owned by the family of Linda Ronstadt, located on the northern edge of Tucson, near Sabino Canyon and Cloud Road. The church doors featured in the film were borrowed from the Chapel in Sasabe, Arizona, and were carved by local Tucson artist Charles Bolsius.

Jester Hairston, who wrote the gospel arrangement of &quot;Amen&quot; used in the film and arranged the vocal parts, also dubbed the vocals for Sidney Poitier, who was tone-deaf.

==Release==
The film was screened in competition at the 1963 Berlin Film Festival in June 1963. It opened October 3, 1963 at the Murray Hill Theater in New York City.

== Reception ==
 &quot;Variety&quot; said it was a film &quot;loaded with charm and which is full of good, clean, honest fun.&quot;

===Accolades===
Sidney Poitier became the first African-American actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor and the second African-American Oscar winner overall (after Hattie McDaniel won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1939).

Also, the film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Homer Smith – Nominated Hero
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers – #46

==Sequel==
The sequel &quot;Christmas Lilies of the Field&quot; was made in 1979 for television in which Homer Smith (now played by Billy Dee Williams), returns and is &quot;persuaded” to build a kindergarten for a group of orphans and runaways whom the sisters have taken in.

<doc id="97738" wikidata="Q821192" url="?curid=97738" title="New Jersey Route 3">
<text>Route 3 is a state highway in the northeastern part of New Jersey. The route runs from U.S. Route 46 (US 46) in Clifton, Passaic County, to US 1/9 in North Bergen, Hudson County. The route intersects many major roads, including US 46, which takes travelers to Interstate 80 (I-80) west for commuting out of the city-area, the Garden State Parkway and Route 21 in Clifton, Route 17 and the Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) in East Rutherford, the Eastern Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (also I-95) in Secaucus, and Route 495 in North Bergen, for traffic going to the Lincoln Tunnel into New York City. Route 3 serves as the main artery to the Lincoln Tunnel from I-80, in conjunction with a portion of US 46 and Route 495. Portions of the route are not up to freeway standards; with driveways serving businesses and bus stops. Despite this, many construction projects have been underway over the years to alleviate this issue. Route 3 also provided access to Hoffmann La Roche&#x27;s former American headquarters in Nutley, the Meadowlands Sports Complex and American Dream in East Rutherford. The road inspired a story in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2004 by Ian Frazier due to its views of the Manhattan skyline. Route 3 was originally the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and ended at the state line in the Hudson River, though it was scaled back following the construction of I-495; which is now Route 495 due to also not meeting interstate highway standards.

Route 3 was originally established in 1927 to run from the New York state line on the west shore of Greenwood Lake to Secaucus. In 1929, the western terminus was cut back to Paterson when the alignment west of there was planned to become part of Route S4B. Route 3 originally followed present-day Route 20 through Paterson and ran along local streets to East Rutherford, where it followed present-day Route 120 and Paterson Plank Road to Secaucus. It was extended east to the Lincoln Tunnel in 1939. The limited-access section of Route 3 between US 46 in Clifton and East Rutherford was completed in the 1940s as Route S3 as well as the Secaucus Bypass, which was designated a bypass of Route 3. Route 3 was moved to the Route S3 freeway and the Secaucus Bypass in 1953 and was truncated to US 1/9 in North Bergen in 1959 when the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as I-495. The Route 3 freeway has seen many improvements over the years, such as widening and interchange reconstructions. It underwent a major reconstruction, completed in 2016, to modern highway standards with bridge replacements, including a new Passaic River bridge between Clifton and Route 17 in Rutherford.

==Route description==
Route 3 heads to the southeast, from an interchange with US 46 and Valley Road (County Route 621 [CR 621]) as a six-lane arterial road with a jersey barrier. It is not up to freeway standards, as it contains a few businesses with right-in/right-out access. The route intersects Grove Street (CR 623) and Broad Street (CR 509), then the Garden State Parkway, where it passes south of the Allwood Road Park &amp; Ride, a park and ride lot serving NJ Transit buses. All interchange movements are present between Route 3 and the Garden State Parkway, except from the southbound Garden State Parkway to westbound Route 3 and from eastbound Route 3 to the northbound Garden State Parkway.

Past the Garden State Parkway, Route 3 intersects Bloomfield Avenue (CR 622), before it passes over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Newark Industrial Track line and intersects Passaic Avenue (CR 603), which heads south into Nutley to become Route 7. The next interchange is for Main Avenue (CR 601). Past that interchange, Route 3 passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s Main Line and comes to an interchange with Route 21 before passing over the route and becoming a six-lane freeway.
Route 3 crosses the Passaic River on a fixed bridge, which replaced a double-leaf trunnion bascule bridge in 2013, into Rutherford, Bergen County. Just after crossing the river, the route intersects Riverside Avenue (CR 507). The freeway continues through a residential area and comes to an exit that provides access to southbound Route 17. Past this interchange, Route 3 is closely paralleled by Route 17 to the south until Route 3 intersects Route 17 again, which continues to the north of Route 3.

The route widens to eight lanes and enters the Meadowlands, crossing into East Rutherford and then passing over NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line and Berrys Creek. Route 3 passes to the south of the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which contains MetLife Stadium (the home stadium of the New York Giants and the New York Jets of the National Football League), and the Meadowlands Racetrack. The route narrows back to six lanes and comes to a ramp which provides access to the Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). Route 3 intersects Route 120 and the carriageways separate. The route passes under the Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) and becomes eight lanes again.
The Route 3 Bridge crosses the Hackensack River into Secaucus, Hudson County. It intersects the Meadowlands Parkway and continues southeast into a residential area with the carriageways joining back together. At the interchange with Paterson Plank Road (CR 681), Route 3 widens into a local-express lane configuration with three express lanes and three local lanes each in the eastbound direction and two express lanes and three local lanes in the westbound direction. The route passes by the Mill Creek Mall and crosses under the Eastern Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). Route 3 comes to an eastbound exit and entrance with Harmon Meadow Boulevard and features a cloverleaf interchange with Paterson Plank Road. The route crosses the Penhorn Creek into North Bergen. In North Bergen, the route comes to a truck-restricted eastbound ramp for eastbound Route 495. Route 3 then intersects Route 495, which provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike and the Lincoln Tunnel. Past this interchange, the local-express lane configuration ends and Route 3 heads southeast as a four-lane highway. The route meets a westbound exit and entrance for the North Bergen Park &amp; Ride serving NJ Transit buses and passes over New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line and Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Northern Branch line before it comes to its terminus at a traffic light with US 1/9 south, with no direct access from Route 3 east to US 1/9 north.

==History==
Route 3 roughly follows the course of the Paterson and New York Plank Road (more commonly known as the Paterson Plank Road) legislated in 1851 to run from Paterson to a ferry at Hoboken. The portion of this road running east from Passaic was legislated as an unnumbered state route in 1926. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 3 was legislated to run from the New York line on the west shore of Greenwood Lake to Route 1 (now US 1/9) in Secaucus. In 1929, the route west of Paterson was designated to become part of Route S4B, a spur of Route 4, and Route 3 was modified to end at Route S4B north of Paterson. Route S4B was never built west of Paterson while the portion that was built became Route 208 in 1953.

Following the 1929 amendments, Route 3 ran from Paterson along today&#x27;s Route 20, through Clifton, Passaic, Wallington, Carlstadt, and East Rutherford along local streets, and finally down Paterson Plank Road (part of which is today&#x27;s Route 120) to Secaucus. Before 1938, a bypass around the original Paterson Plank Road bridge over the Hackensack River was built, parts of which were later incorporated into today&#x27;s Route 120. As of this point, plans were in place to bypass the Plank Road to the north, going north of Wood Ridge and Wallington and replacing River Road up to Route 6, where it would rejoin the old alignment. In 1939, Route 3 was extended east along present-day Route 495 to the Lincoln Tunnel into Manhattan.

The section of what is now Route 3 from US 46 in Clifton to Route 120 in East Rutherford was planned to be built as a freeway in the mid-1930s designated as Route S3, a spur of Route 3. Construction started in 1940, but it was interrupted by World War II. It would resume, with the first section of freeway opening between Route 17 to Route 3 (now Route 120) in 1942. The freeway was completed by 1949, including a bypass of Secaucus that was designated as a bypass of Route 3. The freeway had cost a total of $10 million to build and cut commuting times between Northern New Jersey and Manhattan. Before the freeway was completed, Route S3 was designated to follow Allwood Road between Hepburn Road and Bloomfield Avenue in Clifton; the road was later returned to Passaic County and is currently CR 602. In 1942, a spur of Route S3 in Clifton was commissioned; this became Route S3 Spur in 1948 and Route 161 in 1953.

In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 3 was realigned to follow the entire length of the Route S3 freeway. In addition, Route 3 in Secaucus was shifted off the Paterson Plank Road to the newly built Secaucus Bypass. The original alignment of Route 3 through Secaucus (partly now known as Flanagan Way) became Route 153; the entire route was eliminated by the late 1980s. The remaining sections under state maintenance were designated as Route 20, still under the assumption that they would be joined in the future. In the mid-1950s, Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System; however, the New Jersey State Highway Department had deemed it too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards and I-280 was favored instead. In 1959, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as I-495 and Route 3 was truncated back to US 1/9 in North Bergen.
Many improvements have been made to the Route 3 freeway. In the 1970s, the interchanges with Route 17, the New Jersey Turnpike Western Spur, and Route 120 were improved with the construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex in the area. The bridge over the Berrys Creek, originally built in 1948, was reconstructed in the mid-1990s and Route 3 was widened to eight lanes in the area near the bridge. In 2003, the interchange with Route 495 and the intersection with US 1/9 was improved at a cost of $16 million.

Plans were made to improve Route 3 near the Meadowlands Sports Complex with the construction of the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in May 2009 at a cost of $38.1 million, a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in early 2010 at a cost of $13 million, and improvements to the New Jersey Turnpike interchange was completed in the later part of 2010 at a cost of $49 million.

Route 3 underwent a major reconstruction to modern highway standards with noise walls installed and bridge replacements, including the new Passaic River bridge that is now functional, between Main Avenue in Clifton and Route 17 in Rutherford. All work was completed by 2016. In a separate project, the roadway was resurfaced in 2013 from just west of the Route 17 north interchange to US 1/9 in North Bergen.

The New Jersey Department of Transportation is rebuilding the interchange at US 46 and Valley Road in Clifton. This project will reconfigure ramps, bring bridges up to standard, and will provide for three-lane connections between Route 3 and US 46. It is projected to cost more than $250 million. Construction on the first contract began in December 2015 with completion by October 2019. Construction on the second contract began in February 2020. In January 2022, the officials announced funding of a project to replace the 1934 eastbound bridge over the Hackensack River. The new bridge structure will be able to support adding light rail over the bridge in the future. The plan is to have a new light rail line from Secaucus Junction to MetLife Stadium and American Dream, but funding for the light rail is not immediately available.

==In popular culture==

Route 3 was the inspiration for a story in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2004 by Ian Frazier, for its iconic views of the Manhattan skyline. In this story, Frazier describes a bus journey along the route, mentioning scenes along the road such as traffic congestion, the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and the Tick Tock Diner off Route 3 in Clifton. He also described a walking journey he once took into New York City along Route 3, encountering heavy, noisy traffic speeding by and debris along the side of the road.

In a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch featuring Horatio Sanz and Derek Jeter, the fictional business &quot;Derek Jeter&#x27;s Taco Hole&quot; is on Route 3 in Nutley, New Jersey between Kinko&#x27;s and &quot;El Duque&#x27;s Shoe Repair&quot;. (Route 3 does not actually pass through Nutley.)

<doc id="97740" wikidata="Q1166360" url="?curid=97740" title="Darling (1965 film)">
<text>Darling is a 1965 British romantic drama film directed by John Schlesinger from a screenplay written by Frederic Raphael. It stars Julie Christie as Diana Scott, a young successful model and actress in Swinging London, toying with the affections of two older men, played by Dirk Bogarde and Laurence Harvey. The film was shot on location in London, Paris and Rome and at Shepperton Studios by cinematographer Kenneth Higgins, with a musical score composed by Sir John Dankworth.

The film premiered at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival on 16 July 1965, and was released in cinemas in the United Kingdom on 16 September by Anglo-Amalgamated. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $4.5 million, and received five nominations at the 38th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won in three categories: Best Actress (for Christie), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Costume Design. It also won four BAFTA Awards: Best British Actor (Bogarde), Best British Actress (Christie), Best British Screenplay and Best Art Direction (Black-and-White).

== Plot ==
Diana Scott is a bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people&#x27;s views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio, and it is there that their relationship starts. After liaisons in hotel rooms, they leave their spouses (and, in Robert&#x27;s case, children) and move into an apartment.

As a couple they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the men of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the Glass Corporation, who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely.

Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is juxtaposed with wealthy guests gorging themselves with food. Diana later becomes pregnant and decides to have an abortion to sustain her career.

She flies to Paris with Miles for more jet-set sophistication. There she finds the wild party, beat music, strip dance mind game and cross-dressing repellent but slowly adjusts and holds her own, gaining the respect of the crowd when she taunts Miles during the game. On her return to London, Robert calls her a whore upon discovering her affair with Miles and leaves her. Miles then casts her as &quot;The Happiness Girl&quot; in the Glass Corporation&#x27;s advertising campaign for a chocolate firm.

Diana finds comfort in the company of gay photographer Malcolm, who has created her new famous look. They go shopping, where she randomly decides to shoplift several items. On location at a palazzo near Rome, Diana smiles in her medieval/Renaissance costume and completes &quot;The Happiness Girl&quot; shoot. She is taken with the beauty of the building and the landscape, getting on well with the prince, Cesare, who owns the palazzo. With the friendly Malcolm, Diana decides to stay in Italy. They stay in a simple house by a small harbor in Capri, where Diana flirts half-heartedly with Catholicism. They are visited by Cesare, who arrives in a huge launch, invites them on board and proposes to Diana. She politely declines his proposal, but Cesare leaves the offer open.

Diana returns to London, still living in the flat she shared with Robert, where she has a party with Miles and other assorted media characters. Robert comes by to visit Diana but sees that she is with Miles and departs. Becoming disillusioned with Miles and the vacuous London jet set, Diana flirts with the Catholic church again. Impulsively, she flies to Italy and marries the prince, which proves to be ill-fated. Though waited on hand and foot by the servants, she is almost immediately abandoned in the vast palazzo by Cesare, who visits Rome frequently.

Diana flees to London to visit Robert, and the two have sex, making her believe they are ready for a stable, long-term relationship. However, in the morning he tells her that he is leaving her and that he fooled her only as an act of revenge. He reserves a flight to Rome, packs her into his car and takes her to Heathrow airport to send her back to her life as Princess Della Romita. At the airport Diana is hounded by the press, who address her as Princess. She boards the plane to leave.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to Richard Gregson, agent for John Schlesinger, the budget was around £300,000 and was entirely provided by Nat Cohen at Anglo-Amalgamated. The movie was originally called &quot;Woman on Her Way&quot;.

Shirley MacLaine originally was cast as Diana, but was replaced by Christie. Production on &quot;Darling&quot; commenced on 12 August 1964 and wrapped in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darling (1965) – Box office / business&quot;&gt;Box office / business for &quot;Darling&quot; at the Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed on location in London, Paris, and Rome. The Romita palazzo was portrayed by the Medici villa. The final scene was shot at Heathrow Airport in London.

In 1971, &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote of mod fashion and its wearers: &quot;This new, &quot;déclassé&quot; English girl was epitomized by Julie Christie in &quot;Darling&quot;—amoral, rootless, emotionally immature, and apparently irresistible.&quot; John Schlesinger admitted Julie Christie didn&#x27;t want to do her nude scene.

==Reception==
Despite receiving many awards at the time of release, the film later developed a mixed reputation. In his &quot;New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot; entry on Schlesinger, David Thomson writes that the film &quot;deserves a place in every archive to show how rapidly modishness withers. Beauty is central to the cinema and Schlesinger seems an unreliable judge of it, over-rating Christie and rarely getting close enough to the action to make a fruitful stylistic bond with it&quot;. &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; described it as a &quot;trendy, influential &#x27;60s film – in flashy form and cynical content&quot;. Tony Rayns though, in the &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot;, is as damning as Thomson. For him, the film is a &quot;leaden rehash of ideas from Godard, Antonioni and Bergman&quot;, although with nods to the &quot;Royal Court school&quot;, which &quot;now looks grotesquely pretentious and out of touch with the realities of the life-styles that it purports to represent.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Darling&quot; holds an approval rating of 67% from 18 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10.

===Box office===
The film was a commercial success, grossing $12 million at the worldwide box office against a budget of only £400,000. It earned $4 million in theatrical rentals.

According to Richard Gregson, the film only earned £250,000 in the United Kingdom, but Nat Cohen sold the U.S. rights to Joe E. Levine for $900,000 and made a profit – and the film was more successful in the U.S.

&quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;there’s always a market for such tales if done right because you can vicariously enjoy the high life while being reassured about your own dull existence because the pretty people are unhappy). It had Christie’s charisma, lots of sex, and was given tremendous contemporary quality by Schlesinger’s handling.&quot;

<doc id="97752" wikidata="Q828240" url="?curid=97752" title="New Jersey Route 495">
<text>Route 495 is a state highway in Hudson County, New Jersey, in the United States that connects the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) at exits 16E-17 in Secaucus to New York State Route 495 (NY 495) inside the Lincoln Tunnel in Weehawken, providing access to Midtown Manhattan in New York City. The road is owned and operated by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) between the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) between Route 3 and Park Avenue near the Union City–Weehawken border, and by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) east of Park Avenue, including the helix viaduct used to descend the New Jersey Palisades to reach the entrance of the Lincoln Tunnel. Route 495 is mostly a six-lane freeway with a reversible bus lane used during the morning rush hour. The bus lane, which runs the entire length of the freeway, continues into the Lincoln Tunnel&#x27;s center tube.

The first portion of the present-day Route 495, at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel, was constructed in 1937 when the Lincoln Tunnel opened. In 1939, the section known as The Helix was finished, which is an oval-shaped loop that descends Route 495 down to the entrance of the tunnel. In that same year, the route’s path was extended west to Route 3 and it became an eastern extension of that route. In 1952, the portion of the route west of Route 3 was opened when the New Jersey Turnpike was completed. In 1959, the road was incorporated into the Interstate Highway System and was designated as part of Interstate 495 (I-495). Since the Mid-Manhattan Expressway that would have connected the route to New York&#x27;s I-495 (Long Island Expressway) was canceled, I-495 officially became New Jersey Route 495 in 1979, and the signs were changed in 1989.

==Route description==

Route 495 officially begins at the exit 16E off-ramp from the northbound lanes of the New Jersey Turnpike near the boundary of Secaucus and North Bergen. The main roadway heads east through North Bergen as a six-lane freeway maintained by the NJTA. The route has an interchange with Route 3, with access to eastbound Route 3 and U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1/9) for traffic in the eastbound direction and to westbound Route 3 in the westbound direction, a major intersection for Route 495 and Route 3, as many people use Route 3 to get to Route 495 for the Lincoln Tunnel. Route 3 ends almost immediately after its interchange with Route 495, at US 1/9. The three routes form a triangular-like junction, however, Route 495 doesn’t have direct access to US 1/9; instead drivers must take the Route 3 exit to get there. Past this interchange, Route 495 becomes a six-lane freeway maintained by NJDOT that passes over New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line and Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Northern Branch line before intersects US 1/9 at a partial interchange, with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. Past US 1/9, the freeway has an interchange with County Route 501 (CR 501, John F. Kennedy Boulevard), which uses 30th Street and 31st Street as collector–distributor roads. East of this junction, Route 495 enters Union City and heads through developed residential areas, passing under numerous streets. It enters Weehawken and comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance for Park Avenue, which provides access to Weehawken and Hoboken, where Route 495 becomes maintained by the PANYNJ.
At this point, the highway loops around itself at a section of the highway locally known as &quot;The Helix&quot;, descending the New Jersey Palisades on a 360 degree looped spiral bridge to reach the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson River. At the start of the Helix, Route 495 passes Weehawken stadium to the north and east, and would later go under it at the start of the Lincoln Tunnel. The route has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance for and from CR 677 (John F. Kennedy/Hudson Boulevard East). After interchanging with Boulevard East, the road enters the Lincoln Tunnel. At the New York state line, which is located at the midpoint of the Hudson River, the road continues as NY 495, which is separate from I-495, and heads into Midtown Manhattan in New York City.
Since 1970, the left lane of the three westbound lanes is converted during the morning rush hour to a reversible bus lane, known as the &quot;Exclusive Bus Lane&quot; (XBL). The Port Authority is responsible for daily operation of the XBL, including its opening and closing, removal of disabled vehicles, and response to emergencies. It is used by buses headed east from the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3, mainly to the Port Authority Bus Terminal just past the Lincoln Tunnel in Manhattan, serving over 1,800 buses and 65,000 bus commuters on regular weekday mornings, (6-10 a.m.). This bus lane is the busiest in the United States.

Each of the travel lanes in the Lincoln Tunnel&#x27;s center tube is reversible. In general, both of the lanes, including the exclusive bus lane, serve Manhattan-bound traffic during the weekday morning rush hour, both of the lanes serve New Jersey-bound traffic during the weekday evening rush hour, and one lane is provided in each direction during other time periods. New Jersey-bound traffic normally uses both lanes of the north tube and Manhattan-bound traffic normally uses both lanes of the south tube.

Route 495 is a busy route that carries approximately 74,571 vehicles at its western terminus and approximately 119,432 vehicles by the time it reaches the Lincoln Tunnel. According to the American Highway Users Alliance, Route 495 is considered one of the most congested corridors on the East Coast of the United States; , drivers spent a cumulative 3.4 million hours per year sitting in congestion on Route 495.

==History==

The road was built as an approach to the Lincoln Tunnel, with the first section opening December 22, 1937, when the first (now the center) tube of the tunnel was completed. This section ran only from the tunnel portal south through the toll booths to a plaza with Park Avenue and Hudson County Boulevard East. Marginal Street, providing access from Hudson County Boulevard East west over Park Avenue to 32nd Street and the Bergen Turnpike, was also opened at that time. In 1939, the Port Authority opened the rest of the approach, up the helix and west to Route 3, and it was designated as an eastern extension of Route 3. The final section of today&#x27;s Route 495 opened on January 15, 1952, with the completion of the New Jersey Turnpike. The turnpike interchange (exit 16) only served Route 3 traffic to and from the south; exit 17 served Route 3 traffic to and from the north.

With the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel was planned to become an Interstate Highway along with present-day Route 3, which itself was not included in the Interstate Highway System because New Jersey thought it would be too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards. However, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was included in the Interstate Highway System and in 1959, it was renumbered from Route 3 to I-495 despite the fact it does not meet Interstate Highway standards. Shortly after the road became I-495, the western portion of the road was brought up to Interstate Highway standards with the improvements of the interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3. I-495 was intended to connect with New York&#x27;s I-495 by way of the Mid-Manhattan Expressway; however, this proposed freeway through Manhattan was canceled in 1971 due to strong opposition to the road running through the heart of Midtown Manhattan. Because New Jersey&#x27;s I-495 would not be connected to New York&#x27;s, NJDOT started referring to the route as Route 495 in 1979. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the decommissioning of I-495 between I-95 and Pleasant Avenue/Park Avenue in Union City in 1980. In 1986, AASHTO approved the decommissioning of the rest of the I-495 designation in New Jersey.
Starting with the viaduct, which passes over the Conrail rail lines just west of US 1/9, the roadway going east is listed as being eligible for state registry in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places for its engineering, architecture and history. The designations for eligibility were given in segments between 1991 and 2003 and include the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix, as well as the tunnels, toll booths, and ventilation towers.

The Helix has traditionally been known for offering a panoramic view of the Manhattan skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, construction of a new residential building partially blocked the view from the lower portion of the roadway. , the Helix is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years. Alternatives to its replacement include tunnels under the Palisades directly to the Lincoln Tunnel portals.

In June 2018, the New Jersey Department of Transportation announced that it would renovate the North Bergen Viaduct (the section passing over US 1/9 and Conrail) over the course of more than two years. During that time, one travel lane in each direction would be closed, reducing the number of travel lanes in each direction from 4 to 3.

<doc id="97758" wikidata="Q323827" url="?curid=97758" title="Doctor Zhivago (film)">
<text>Doctor Zhivago () is a 1965 epic historical romance film directed by David Lean with a screenplay by Robert Bolt, based on the 1957 novel by Boris Pasternak. The story is set in Russia during World War I and the Russian Civil War. The film stars Omar Sharif in the title role as Yuri Zhivago, a married physician and poet whose life is altered by the Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war, and Julie Christie as his lover Lara Antipova. Geraldine Chaplin, Tom Courtenay, Rod Steiger, Alec Guinness, Ralph Richardson, Siobhán McKenna, and Rita Tushingham play supporting roles.

Although immensely popular in the West, Pasternak&#x27;s book was banned in the Soviet Union for decades. As the film could not be made there, it was instead filmed mostly in Spain. It was an international co-production between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Italian producer Carlo Ponti.

Contemporary critics were critical of its length at over three hours and claimed that it trivialized history, but acknowledged the intensity of the love story and the film&#x27;s treatment of human themes. At the 38th Academy Awards, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; was nominated for ten Oscars (including Best Picture) and won five: Best Adapted Screenplay, Original Score, Cinematography, Art Direction, and Costume Design. It also won five awards at the 23rd Golden Globe Awards including Best Motion Picture.

, it is the ninth highest-grossing film worldwide after adjusting for inflation. In 1998, it was ranked 39th by the American Film Institute on their 100 Years... 100 Movies list, and by the British Film Institute in 1999 as the 27th greatest British film ever.

==Plot==

===Part one===
NKVD Lieutenant General Yevgraf Zhivago searches for the daughter of his half-brother Dr. Yuri Zhivago and Larissa (&quot;Lara&quot;) Antipova. Yevgraf believes a young dam worker, Tanya Komarova, may be his niece and explains to her why.

After his mother&#x27;s burial, the orphaned child Yuri, owning only an inherited balalaika, was taken by family friends Alexander and Anna Gromeko to Moscow. In 1913, Zhivago, now a doctor and poet, becomes engaged to the Gromekos&#x27; daughter Tonya after her schooling in Paris.

Meanwhile, 17-year-old Lara is seduced by her mother&#x27;s much older friend/lover, the well-connected Victor Komarovsky. Lara&#x27;s friend, the idealistic Pasha Antipov, who wishes to marry her, is wounded by mounted police at a peaceful demonstration. Lara treats Pasha&#x27;s wound, and hides a gun he picked up.

Discovering Lara&#x27;s relationship with Komarovsky, her mother attempts suicide. Komarovsky attempts to dissuade Lara from marrying Pasha. She refuses and he rapes her. A traumatised Lara later follows Komarovsky to a party, shoots him in the arm, and is escorted out by Pasha. Pasha marries her, despite now knowing about her relationship with Komarovsky. They leave Moscow.

During World War I, Yuri, now married to Tonya, becomes a battlefield doctor. Pasha joins up, but is reported missing. Lara enlists as a nurse to search for him and encounters Zhivago. For six months, they serve at a field hospital, as unrest grows in Russia after exiled Vladimir Lenin returns. The two fall in love, but Zhivago remains faithful to Tonya.

After Russia leaves the war, Yuri returns to Tonya, their son Sasha and the widowed Alexander Gromeko in their Moscow house, which was confiscated by the Soviet government and now houses many other people. Yevgraf, now a Cheka officer, tells Yuri his poems have been condemned as anti-communist. Yevgraf provides documents so the family can travel to the Gromekos&#x27; country home, &quot;Varykino&quot;, in the Urals near Yuriatin. Their heavily guarded train travels through contested territory where Bolshevik commander Strelnikov is fighting anti-communist White forces.

===Part two===
The train stops near Strelnikov&#x27;s armored train. Yuri gets out, is captured and taken to Strelnikov, whom Yuri recognizes as Pasha. Strelnikov mentions that Lara lives in Yuriatin, now White-occupied. Strelnikov lets Zhivago return to his train. The family find the main house at Varykino sealed up by the Bolsheviks; they settle into a neighboring cottage. In Yuriatin, Yuri sees Lara, and they begin an affair. When Tonya is about to give birth to a second child, Yuri breaks off with Lara but is forcibly enlisted by Communist partisans.

After two years, Yuri deserts and returns to Yuriatin. Lara says Tonya contacted her while searching for Yuri. Leaving his belongings with Lara, she returned to Moscow. Tonya later sent Lara a sealed letter for Yuri. Tonya had borne a daughter, and she, her father, and two children are living in Paris following deportation.

Yuri and Lara become lovers again but Komarovsky arrives. Cheka agents have been watching them due to Lara&#x27;s marriage to Strelnikov. Komarovsky offers them help escaping Russia, but they refuse, instead going to Varykino, and hiding in the main house. Yuri begins the &quot;Lara&quot; poems, which will bring him fame but government disapproval. Komarovsky arrives with troops. Recently appointed as a Far Eastern Republic official, he says the Cheka allowed Lara to remain in the area only to lure Strelnikov; he had been captured five miles away, and committed suicide. They now intend to arrest Lara. Komarovsky&#x27;s offer of safe passage is accepted, but once Lara is on her way, Yuri does not follow. On the train, Lara tells Komarovsky she is pregnant by Yuri.

Years later, Yevgraf finds a Moscow medical job for his now frail half-brother. Yuri sees Lara in the street. He has a fatal heart attack before reaching her. At Yuri&#x27;s funeral Lara asks Yevgraf for help finding her daughter by Yuri, who vanished during the civil war. Yevgraf helps her search the orphanages, in vain. Lara then disappears and Yevgraf believes she died in a gulag.

Yevgraf believes that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara&#x27;s daughter; she remains unconvinced. Asked how she became lost, Tanya answers that her &quot;father&quot; (Komarovsky) let go of her hand when they were running from bombardment. Yevgraf responds that a real father would not have let go. Tanya promises to consider Yevgraf&#x27;s words. Her boyfriend David arrives, and she leaves with him. Yevgraf notices Tanya carries a balalaika. He asks if she can play, and David replies, &quot;She&#x27;s an artist!&quot;, and says she is untrained. Yevgraf responds, &quot;Ah... then it&#x27;s a gift!&quot;

==Production==

===Background===
Boris Pasternak&#x27;s novel was published in the West amidst celebration and controversy. Pasternak began writing it in 1945, and was giving private readings of excerpts as early as 1946. However, the novel was not completed until 1956. The book had to be smuggled out of the Soviet Union by an Italian called D&#x27;Angelo to be delivered to Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, a left-wing Italian publisher who published it shortly thereafter, in 1957. Helped by a Soviet campaign against the novel, it became a sensation throughout the non-communist world. It spent 26 weeks atop &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list.

Pasternak was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize for Literature. While the citation noted his poetry, it was speculated that the prize was mainly for &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, which the Soviet government saw as an anti-Soviet work, thus interpreting the award of the Nobel Prize as a gesture hostile to the Soviet Union. A target of the Soviet government&#x27;s fervent campaign to label him a traitor, Pasternak felt compelled to refuse the Prize. The situation became an international &quot;cause célèbre&quot; and made Pasternak a Cold War symbol of resistance to Soviet communism.

===Development and casting===
The film treatment by David Lean was proposed for various reasons. Pasternak&#x27;s novel had been an international success, and producer Carlo Ponti was interested in adapting it as a vehicle for his wife, Sophia Loren. Lean, coming off the huge success of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), wanted to make a more intimate, romantic film to balance the action- and adventure-oriented tone of his previous film. One of the first actors signed onboard was Omar Sharif, who had played Lawrence&#x27;s right-hand man Sherif Ali in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Sharif loved the novel, and when he heard Lean was making a film adaptation, he requested to be cast in the role of Pasha (which ultimately went to Tom Courtenay).

Sharif was quite surprised when Lean suggested that he play Zhivago. Peter O&#x27;Toole, star of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, was Lean&#x27;s original choice for Zhivago, but turned the part down; Max von Sydow and Paul Newman were also considered. Rod Taylor was offered the role but turned it down. Michael Caine tells in his autobiography that he also read for Zhivago and participated in the screen shots with Christie, but (after watching the results with David Lean) was the one who suggested Omar Sharif. Rod Steiger was cast as Komarovsky after Marlon Brando and James Mason turned the part down. Audrey Hepburn was considered for Tonya, and Robert Bolt lobbied for Albert Finney to play Pasha.

Lean convinced Ponti that Loren was not right for the role of Lara, saying she was &quot;too tall&quot; (and confiding in screenwriter Robert Bolt that he could not accept Loren as a virgin for the early parts of the film), and Jeanne Moreau, Yvette Mimieux, Sarah Miles and Jane Fonda were considered for the role. Ultimately, Julie Christie was cast based on her appearance in &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1963) and the recommendation of Jack Cardiff, who directed her in &quot;Young Cassidy&quot; (1965). Sharif&#x27;s son Tarek was cast as the young Zhivago, and Sharif directed his son as a way to get closer to his character.

===Filming===
Lean&#x27;s experience filming a part of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; in Spain, access to CEA Studios, and the guarantee of snow in some parts of Spain led to his choosing the country as the primary location for filming. However, the weather predictions failed and David Lean&#x27;s team experienced Spain&#x27;s warmest winter in 50 years. As a result, some scenes were filmed in interiors with artificial snow made with dust from a nearby marble quarry. The team filmed some locations with natural heavy snow, such as the snowy landscape in Strelnikov&#x27;s train sequence, somewhere in Campo de Gómara near Soria.

Nicolas Roeg was the original director of photography and worked on some scenes but, after an argument with Lean, he left and was replaced by Freddie Young. Principal photography began on 28 December 1964, and production ended on 8 October the following year; the entire Moscow set was built from scratch outside Madrid. Most of the scenes covering Zhivago&#x27;s and Lara&#x27;s service in World War I were filmed in Soria, as was the Varykino estate. The &quot;ice-palace&quot; at Varykino was filmed in Soria as well, a house filled with frozen beeswax. The charge of the partisans across the frozen lake was also filmed in Spain; a cast iron sheet was placed over a dried river-bed, and fake snow (mostly marble dust) was added on top. Some of the winter scenes were filmed in summer with warm temperatures, sometimes of up to 25 °C (77 °F). Other locations include Madrid-Delicias railway station in Madrid and the Moncayo Range. The initial and final scenes were shot at the Aldeadávila Dam between Spain and Portugal. Although uncredited, most of those scenes were shot on the Portuguese side of the river, overlooking the Spanish side.

Other winter sequences, mostly landscape scenes and Yuri&#x27;s escape from the partisans, were filmed in Finland. Winter scenes of the family traveling to Yuriatin by rail were filmed in Canada. The locomotives seen in the film are Spanish locomotives like the RENFE Class 240 (ex-1400 MZA), and Strelnikov&#x27;s armoured train is towed by the RENFE Class 141F Mikado locomotive.

One train scene became notorious for the supposed fate that befell Lili Muráti, a Hungarian actress, who slipped clambering onto a moving train. Although she fell under the wagon, she escaped serious injury and returned to work within three weeks (and did not perish or lose a limb). Lean appears to have used part of her accident in the film&#x27;s final cut.

In May 1966, the film was entered into competition at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival.

===Home media===
On 24 September 2002, the 35th Anniversary version of &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; was issued on DVD (two-disc set), and another Anniversary Edition in 2010 on Blu-ray (a three-disc set that includes a book).

==Critical reception==
Upon its initial release, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; was criticized for its romanticization of the revolution. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that the film&#x27;s focus on the love story between Zhivago and Lara trivialized the events of the Russian Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War, but was impressed by the film&#x27;s visuals. Also critical of the film was &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Richard Roud, who wrote: &quot;In the film the revolution is reduced to a series of rather annoying occurrences; getting firewood, finding a seat on a train, and a lot of nasty proles being tiresome. Whatever one thinks of the Russian Revolution it was certainly more than a series of consumer problems. At least it was to Zhivago himself. The whole point of the book was that even though Zhivago disapproved of the course the revolution took, he had approved of it in principle. Had he not, there would have been no tragedy&quot;. Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a grievous disappointment ... these able actors have been given almost nothing to do except wear costumes and engage in banal small talk. &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; is one of the stillest motion pictures of all time, and an occasional bumpy train ride or crudely inserted cavalry charge only points up its essential immobility.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;The best one can say of &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; is that it is an honest failure. Boris Pasternak&#x27;s sprawling, complex, elusive novel is held together by its unity of style, by the driving force of its narrative, by the passionate voice of a poet who weaves a mass of diverse characters into a single tapestry. And this is precisely what David Lean&#x27;s film lacks. Somewhere in the two years of the film&#x27;s making the spirit of the novel has been lost.&quot;

Among the positive reviews, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film &quot;literate, old-fashioned, soul-filling and thoroughly romantic&quot;. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; declared, &quot;The sweep and scope of the Russian revolution, as reflected in the personalities of those who either adapted or were crushed, has been captured by David Lean in &#x27;Doctor Zhivago,&#x27; frequently with soaring dramatic intensity. Director [David Lean] has accomplished one of the most meticulously designed and executed films—superior in several visual respects to his &#x27;Lawrence of Arabia.&#x27;&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;as throat-catchingly magnificent as the screen could be, the apotheosis of the cinema as art. With Spain and Finland doubling, absolutely incredibly, for Moscow and the Urals in all seasons, we are transplanted to another land and time ... if you will brace yourself for an inordinately lengthy session—intermission notwithstanding—in a theater seat, I can promise you some fine film-making.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;Visually beautiful and finely acted.&quot; He identified the film&#x27;s length as its &quot;greatest drawback&quot; but wrote that &quot;we weary of the long train ride or become impatient with individual scenes, but, thinking back on them, we perceive their proper intent.&quot; Clifford Terry of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that director David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt &quot;have fashioned out of a rambling book, a well controlled film highlighted by excellent acting and brilliant production.&quot;

Reviewing it for its 30th anniversary, film critic Roger Ebert regarded it as &quot;an example of superb old-style craftsmanship at the service of a soppy romantic vision&quot;, and wrote that &quot;the story, especially as it has been simplified by Lean and his screenwriter, Robert Bolt, seems political in the same sense &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is political, as spectacle and backdrop, without ideology&quot;, concluding that the political content is treated mostly as a &quot;sideshow&quot;. Geoffrey Macnab of &quot;The Independent&quot; reviewed the film for its 50th anniversary and noted director David Lean&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary artistry&quot; but found the film bordering on &quot;kitsch&quot;. Macnab also felt that the musical score by Maurice Jarre still stood up but criticised the English accents.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating 84% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 7.60/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;It may not be the best of David Lean&#x27;s epics, but &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot; is still brilliantly photographed and sweepingly romantic.&quot;

In 2013, Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck cited &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; as an influence on the 2013 film &quot;Frozen&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
Both &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; received the most nominations at the 38th Academy Awards (ten each). Both films won five Academy Awards apiece, but &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; won Best Picture and Best Director. Julie Christie was not nominated for her role in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, but won Best Actress in the same year, for her performance in &quot;Darling&quot;.

<text>Route 70 is a state highway located in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It extends from an interchange with Route 38 in Pennsauken, Camden County, east to an intersection with Route 34 and Route 35 in Wall Township, Monmouth County. Route 70 cuts across the middle of the state as a two-lane highway through the Pine Barrens in Burlington and Ocean counties. A popular truck route, it provides access between Philadelphia and the surrounding Philadelphia metro area and the Jersey Shore resorts, particularly Long Beach Island by way of Route 72. It is also a congested commercial route within Philadelphia&#x27;s New Jersey suburbs. The western section in Cherry Hill and Marlton is a four- to eight-lane divided highway that serves as a major suburban arterial and is locally known as Marlton Pike. The eastern section in Monmouth and Ocean counties is also a multilane divided highway that runs through suburban areas.

The portion of the current route between Whitesbog and Lakehurst became a part of pre-1927 Route 18 in 1923. In 1927, Route 40 was legislated to run from Camden to Lakewood; the termini were eventually moved to the Airport Circle in Pennsauken and the Laurelton Circle in Brick. Route 40 became Route 70 in 1953 in order to avoid conflicting with US 40; in addition, the western terminus was cut back to its current location to avoid a concurrency with Route 38 and the eastern terminus was moved to the Brielle Circle, replacing a portion of Route 34 between the Laurelton Circle and the Brielle Circle.

==Route description==
===Camden and Burlington counties===

Route 70 begins at an interchange with Route 38 and Marlton Pike (CR 601) and Browning Road (CR 612) in Pennsauken, Camden County. From this interchange, it heads to the southeast on Marlton Pike, a six-lane divided highway that runs through suburban residential and commercial areas. The road is also officially called the John Davison Rockefeller Memorial Highway for its entire length after John D. Rockefeller. The road enters Cherry Hill and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Cuthbert Boulevard (CR 636) before crossing under NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line, a short distance to the south of the Cherry Hill Station. In this area, Route 70 passes to the south of a retail and residential development at the former site of the Garden State Park Racetrack before crossing the intersection of Grove Street/Haddonfield Road (CR 644). Past this intersection, the route narrows to four lanes and turns more to the east as it comes to the Ellisburg area. In Ellisburg, it has an intersection with Kings Highway (Route 41/CR 573) and Brace Road (Route 154). The road runs through more suburban areas as it encounters I-295 at a cloverleaf interchange. A short distance past I-295, Route 70 passes over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange before widening into an eight-lane highway and continuing east to the intersections of Greentree Road (CR 674) and Springdale Road (CR 673). Following the intersection of Springdale Road (CR 673), the road narrows back to four lanes before it encounters the intersection of CR 600, a former alignment of the road known as Old Marlton Pike.
Route 70 crosses the Pennsauken Creek into Evesham Township, Burlington County, running east through more commercial areas within the Marlton section of the township. A short distance later, the route intersects Route 73 at a partial cloverleaf interchange that was formerly the Marlton Circle. After this interchange, the road heads east passing through some more commercial areas and then into residential neighborhoods that are separated from the road by trees, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. It continues into a mix of suburban development and rural woods and farms as it crosses into Medford, coming to a crossroads with Medford-Evesboro Road (CR 618). From this intersection, Route 70 continues east through the Medford area, passing a couple of shopping centers before crossing the intersection of North Main Street/Medford-Mount Holly Road (CR 541). After the intersection of North Main Street/Medford-Mount Holly Road (CR 541), the route leaves the suburban development and runs through a mix of woodland and farmland with occasional homes. It enters Southampton, where the road enters more wooded surroundings before coming to US 206 at the Red Lion Circle.

Past here, Route 70 loses the Marlton Pike name and continues east into the heavily wooded Pine Barrens. It passes to the south of the Leisuretowne retirement village before entering predominantly rural areas, with two fire lanes paralleling the road on either side. Route 70 eventually turns slightly to the northeast and forms the border between Southampton to the north and Woodland Township to the south. Along this borderline, the route comes to the Four Mile Circle, where it intersects with the western terminus of Route 72 as well as Magnolia Road (CR 644) and Four Mile Road (CR 646). Past the traffic circle, Route 70 becomes the border between Pemberton Township to the north and Woodland Township to the south. The road passes to the south of the wooded Presidential Lakes Estates residential development before turning northeast through more of the Pine Barrens entirely within Pemberton Township. The road passes near some cranberry bogs before intersecting with Lakehurst Road (CR 530). At this intersection, CR 530 heads east concurrently with Route 70.

===Ocean and Monmouth counties===

A short distance later, the two routes enter Manchester in Ocean County and continue east through a tract of the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest within the Pine Barrens as well as a corner of the Fort Dix Military Reservation. The road eventually reaches the community of Whiting, where it passes commercial development at the intersection of Whiting-New Egypt Road (CR 539). Here, CR 530 turns south to follow CR 539 and Route 70 continues northeast back into the Pine Barrens. The road turns more to the north-northeast before heading east into Lakehurst to the south of the Lakehurst Maxfield Field naval station. In Lakehurst, Route 70 comes to the Eisenhower Traffic Circle with CR 4 and CR 12 before running through residential and commercial areas of the town. It intersects with Center Street (CR 547), where it widens into a four-lane divided highway. From here, the route crosses over the Southern Secondary railroad line operated by the Delaware and Raritan River Railroad before coming to the Lakehurst Circle, where it intersects with the western terminus of Route 37.

Route 70 enters Manchester again past this traffic circle and becomes a two-lane undivided road, passing near the wooded residential Leisure Knoll community before crossing the intersection of Ridgeway Road (CR 571). Past Ridgeway Road (CR 571), the route heads through wooded suburban residential and business areas, crossing into Toms River. Here, the road intersects with Whitesville Road (CR 527) and Massachusetts Avenue (CR 637) before becoming a four-lane divided highway again and encountering US 9 at a modified cloverleaf interchange. Following the US 9 interchange, Route 70 enters Lakewood and turns more to the east, crossing the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue (CR 623) prior to a modified cloverleaf interchange with the Garden State Parkway. From here, the route continues into Brick and passes several shopping centers, intersecting with Cedar Bridge Avenue (CR 528) and Chambers Bridge Road (CR 549). At the CR 528 intersection, the road is briefly an undivided highway. It turns northeast, crossing the Metedeconk River before intersecting with Route 88. After this intersection, Route 70 passes more inhabited areas separated from the road by trees, crossing both the intersections of Burnt Tavern Road (CR 632) and Herbertsville Road (CR 549 Spur). A short distance later, it becomes an undivided road and crosses the Manasquan River on the September 11th Memorial Bridge, briefly entering Point Pleasant and entering Brielle, Monmouth County. The September 11th Memorial Bridge is dedicated to residents of Monmouth and Ocean counties who lost their lives in the September 11 attacks. After the bridge, the route turns north through residential areas and becomes a divided highway again, briefly forming the border between Wall Township to the west and Brielle to the east before fully entering Wall Township. Route 70 ends at the former Brielle Circle intersection with Route 34 and Route 35, where the road continues north on Route 35.

==History==
The Camden, Ellisburg, and Marlton Turnpike was chartered in 1849 as a turnpike that was to run from Camden east to Marlton along what is today Route 70 and Browning Road (CR 612)/Marlton Pike (CR 601). The Marlton Pike was taken over by Camden County in 1907 at a time many other turnpikes became public roads. The current alignment of Route 70 between Whitesbog (the west end of the concurrency with CR 530) and Lakehurst was legislated as a part of pre-1927 Route 18 in 1923, a route that was to run from Camden to Toms River. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 40 was designated to run from Camden to Lakewood along the current alignment of Route 70. In addition a spur of this route called Route S40 (now Route 72) was designated to head from the route at the Four Mile Circle to Manahawkin. Eventually, the eastern terminus of Route 40 was moved to the Laurelton Circle in Brick, where it intersected Route 35 (now Route 88) as well as Route 34, which continued north from this point. The western terminus was placed at the Airport Circle with US 30 and US 130 in Pennsauken, ending concurrent with Route 38. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 40 was renumbered to Route 70, to avoid conflicting with US 40 in the state. Also, Route 70 was designated onto its current alignment between Route 38 in Pennsauken and Route 34 and Route 35 at the Brielle Circle, removing the concurrency with Route 38 and replacing the portion of Route 34 between the Laurelton Circle and the Brielle Circle.
Since 1953, many changes have occurred to Route 70. Several traffic circles that had existed on the road had been either modified or replaced by at-grade intersections. The Marlton Circle at Route 73 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run straight through the circle. This circle became known for traffic backups and was later replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary at-grade intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. Also, the Race Track Circle at the intersection with Haddonfield Road/Grove Street (CR 644) was eventually replaced by an at-grade intersection. The Laurelton Circle at Route 88, built in 1937, was replaced by the 1990s. The Ellisburg Circle at Route 41 and Route 154, was replaced by an intersection with jughandles. The Brielle Circle at the eastern terminus was also converted to an intersection with jughandles in 2001. In conjunction with eliminating the Brielle Circle, Route 70 was also widened between the intersection with Jack Martin Boulevard in Brick Township and the former circle. In July 2004, floods caused by heavy rain washed away a bridge along the route in Southampton Township, leading for it to be replaced. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the September 11th Memorial Bridge over the Manasquan River in a $52 million project that increased capacity on the bridge, added monumental decorations, and increased pedestrian access. Construction was completed in September 2008, two years ahead of schedule. In September 2021, NJDOT began a project to repave and reconstruct the section of Route 70 between Route 38 in Pennsauken Township and Cooper Avenue in Evesham Township. The project will include reconstructing jughandles, upgrading traffic signals, improvements to drainage systems, utility improvements, and pedestrian improvements. The reconstruction project is planned to be completed in early 2027.

<text>The ship of fools (Modern German: ; ), is an allegory, first appearing in Book VI of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, about a ship with a dysfunctional crew. The allegory is intended to represent the problems of governance prevailing in a political system not based on expert knowledge.

Images of the ship became popular, especially in German-speaking lands, especially after the publication of Sebastian Brant&#x27;s satirical book &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1494), which served as the inspiration for Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s painting, &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;. Normally, the images show a ship crowded with men mostly wearing traditional jester or fool&#x27;s costume with cloth ears ending in bells, many quarreling, drinking, and fighting. In the book a ship—an entire fleet at first—sets off from Basel, bound for the Paradise of Fools. In it, Brant conceives Saint Grobian, whom he imagines to be the patron saint of vulgar and coarse people. In literary and artistic compositions of the 15th and 16th centuries, the cultural motif of the ship of fools also served to parody the &quot;ark of salvation&quot;, as the Catholic Church was styled.
A &quot;complex political satire&quot;, whose composition was repeated in at least seven different 15th-century prints, indicating great popularity, shows Pope Paul II and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III wrestling at the top of a ship&#x27;s mast, wearing only briefs and their respective Papal tiara and crown. Emblems and labels cover many other European powers; the allegory is of the political fall-out from meetings between the two men in 1468-69. 

After the Protestant Reformation, some depictions took a sectarian turn. A woodcut illustration to an edition of 1584 of Brant&#x27;s book shows the Anti-Christ sitting on top of the overturned &quot;Narrenschiff&quot;, while in the foreground Saint Peter guides a small boat of respectably-dressed men safely to shore.

&quot;Ship of Fools&quot; has continued to be used into the 20th century as the title for numerous books, songs and other works. Some German cities have modern public sculptures of the subject: a fountain by Jürgen Weber in Nuremberg (1980s), a sculptural group in Neuenburg am Rhein (2004), a fountain in Cologne, and one in Bräunlingen of the shipwrecked boat.

==Benjamin Jowett&#x27;s translation of Plato&#x27;s text==

Benjamin Jowett&#x27;s 1871 translation recounts the story as follows:

<text>A Thousand Clowns is a 1965 American comedy-drama film directed by Fred Coe and starring Jason Robards, Barbara Harris, Martin Balsam, and Barry Gordon. An adaptation of a 1962 play by Herb Gardner, it tells the story of an eccentric comedy writer who is forced to conform to society to retain legal custody of his nephew.

Jason Robards starred in both the original Broadway version and in the film. Martin Balsam won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the movie.

==Plot==
Unemployed television writer Murray Burns (Jason Robards) lives in a cluttered New York City studio apartment with his 12-year-old nephew, Nick (Barry Gordon). Murray has been unemployed for five months after quitting his previous job writing jokes for a children&#x27;s television show called &quot;Chuckles the Chipmunk&quot;. Nick, the son of Murray&#x27;s unwed sister, was left with Murray seven years earlier.

When Nick writes a school essay on the benefits of unemployment insurance, his school requests that New York State send social workers to investigate his living conditions. Investigators for the Child Welfare Board Sandra Markowitz (Barbara Harris) and her superior and boyfriend, Albert Amundson (William Daniels), threaten Murray with removal of the child from his custody unless he can prove he is a capable guardian.

Charmed by Nick and Murray, Sandra argues with Albert, who goes off without her to their next case. Sandra spends the night with Murray. She urges Murray to find a job so that he can keep his nephew, and Murray agrees to look. But he walks out of his job interviews, treating them as a joke, because he feels that work would make him conventional and conformist and make every day the same. He apologizes to Sandra, but she is so disappointed in him that she walks out. Yet he knows that if he wishes to keep his nephew, he must swallow his pride and go back to work.

Murray also feels that he cannot let go of Nick until the boy shows some &quot;backbone&quot;. In a confrontation with his brother and agent Arnold (Martin Balsam), Murray expounds his nonconformist worldview: that a person must fight at all costs to retain a sense of identity and aliveness and avoid being absorbed by the homogeneous masses. Arnold retorts that by conforming to the dictates of society, he has become &quot;the best possible Arnold Burns&quot;.

Murray agrees to meet with his former employer, the detested &quot;Chuckles&quot; host Leo Herman (Gene Saks). When Nick does not laugh at Leo&#x27;s pathetic display of comedy, Leo insults Nick, who quietly but firmly puts Leo in his place. Nick becomes upset with Murray for tolerating Leo&#x27;s insults, and Murray sees the boy has finally grown a backbone. Realizing that Nick has come of age, Murray resigns himself to going back to his old job, Sandra returns, and the next morning Murray joins the crowds of people heading off to work.

Music in the film ranges from rudimentary drum cadences to Dixieland arrangements of &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. The song &quot;Yes Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot; is used in several places.

Judy Holliday wrote the lyrics for the theme song &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;. This was her last film credit, as the film was released after her death on June 7, 1965.

Walter Kerr, in his review for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, wrote of Sandy Dennis: &quot;Let me tell you about Sandy Dennis. There should be one in every home.&quot;

<doc id="97774" wikidata="Q865313" url="?curid=97774" title="Myles Standish">
<text>Myles Standish ( – October 3, 1656) was an English military officer and colonist. He was hired as military adviser for Plymouth Colony in present-day Massachusetts, United States by the Pilgrims. Standish accompanied the Pilgrims on the ship &quot;Mayflower&quot; and played a leading role in the administration and defense of Plymouth Colony from its foundation in 1620. On February 17, 1621, the Plymouth Colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to re-elect him to that position for the remainder of his life. Standish served at various times as an agent of Plymouth Colony on a return trip to England, as assistant governor of the colony, and as its treasurer.

A defining characteristic of Standish&#x27;s military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action. He led at least two attacks or small skirmishes against Native Americans in a raid on the village of Nemasket and a conflict at Wessagusset Colony. During these actions, Standish exhibited skill as a soldier, but disturbed more moderate members of the colony due to his brutality toward Natives.

Standish led a botched expedition against French troops at Penobscot in 1635, one of his last military actions. By the 1640s, he relinquished his role as an active soldier and became a farmer in Duxbury, Massachusetts, where he was one of the first settlers. He remained nominal commander of the Pilgrim military forces in the growing colony, but acted in an advisory capacity. He died in his home in Duxbury in 1656 at age 72. Standish supported and defended the Pilgrims&#x27; colony for much of his life, though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church.

Several towns and military installations have been named after Standish, and monuments have been built in his memory. He appears as lead character in the 1858 poem &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a highly fictionalized account which presents him as a timid romantic. The poem was popular in the 19th century and played a role in cementing the Pilgrim story in American culture.

==Birthplace and early military service==
Little is known of Standish&#x27;s origin and early life: his place of birth has been debated by historians. Standish&#x27;s will, drafted in Plymouth Colony in 1656, claims rights of inheritance to property in several locations:

I give unto my son &amp; heire apparent Alexander Standish all my lands as heire apparent by lawfull decent in Ormskirke [Ormskirk] Borscouge [Burscough] Wrightington Maudsley [Mawdesley] Newburrow [Newburgh] Crowston [Croston] and in the Isle of man and given to mee as Right heire by lawfull decent but Surruptuously detained from mee My great Grandfather being a 2cond or younger brother from the house of Standish of Standish.

All but one of the places named in Standish&#x27;s will are in Lancashire, England, with the exception being the Isle of Man. Some historians have concluded that he was therefore born in Lancashire – possibly in the vicinity of Chorley, where a family named Standish owned a manor called Duxbury Hall. However, there is no conclusive evidence linking Myles Standish to that family. A competing interpretation is that he belonged to a Manx branch of the Standish family. No definitive documentation of his birth exists in either Lancashire or the Isle of Man. However, in recent times, the Isle of Man could be referencing a farm near Croston.

The next earliest source on Standish&#x27;s family and early life is a short passage recorded by Nathaniel Morton, secretary of Plymouth Colony, who wrote in his &quot;New England&#x27;s Memorial&quot; (published 1669) that Standish:

was a gentleman, born in Lancashire, and was heir apparent unto a great estate of lands and livings, surreptitiously detained from him; his great grandfather being a second or younger brother from the house of Standish. In his younger time he went over into the low countries, and was a soldier there, and came acquainted with the church at Leyden, and came over into New England, with such of them as at the first set out for the planting of the plantation of New Plymouth, and bare a deep share of their first difficulties, and was always very faithful to their interest.
Standish&#x27;s early military career in the Low Countries is unclear. At the time, the Dutch Republic was embroiled in the Eighty Years&#x27; War with Spain. Queen Elizabeth I of England supported the Protestant Dutch Republic and sent troops to fight the Spanish in the Netherlands, as part of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). Historians are divided on Standish&#x27;s role in the English military. Nathaniel Philbrick refers to him as a &quot;mercenary&quot;, suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking employment in the war, but Justin Winsor claims that Standish received a commission as a lieutenant in the English army and was later promoted to captain while in Holland. Historian Jeremy Bangs argued that Standish likely served under Sir Horatio Vere, the general who led the English troops in the Netherlands at this time. Vere is known to have recruited soldiers for the expedition in both Lancashire and the Isle of Man, among other places. According to historian Tudor Jenks, Standish came to the Netherlands around 1603 and may have seen service during the siege of Sluis in 1604, which involved Vere&#x27;s English troops. The subsequent Treaty of London (1604) ended English involvement in the war; if Standish was a mercenary he might have continued to serve with the Dutch until the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce brought fighting in the region to a halt in 1609.

Standish&#x27;s activities and whereabouts are unrecorded until 1620, at which point he was living with his wife Rose in Leiden, Holland and using the title of &quot;Captain&quot;. There he was hired by a group of refugee Puritan dissenters from England who intended to form a colony in North America (the Pilgrims). Standish was employed as their military adviser. The Puritans had previously hoped the position would be taken by Captain John Smith, who had been one of the founders of the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, and had experience exploring and mapping the American coast. The Pilgrims approached Smith and he expressed interest, but his price was too high and the Pilgrims feared that his fame and bold character might lead him to become a dictator. They appointed Standish instead; he was apparently already known to the Pilgrims.

==Voyage to New Plymouth==

On July 22, 1620 (Old Style date), the initial group of English Dissenters living in Leiden boarded the &quot;Speedwell&quot;, which was meant to accompany another ship to be hired in England. This initial group included the mostly Brownist congregation. Myles and Rose Standish were aboard, along with the Bradfords, Winslows, Carvers, and others. The small, 60-ton pinnace sailed to Southampton with about 30 passengers, to be provisioned and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the New World. Another 90 passengers would board the 180-ton &quot;Mayflower&quot;. The &quot;Speedwell&quot; had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays, but both vessels departed Southampton on August 5.

The leaders of the colony decided to leave the smaller &quot;Speedwell&quot; behind after numerous delays caused by leaking, which had caused them to return to port twice. The Standishes and most of the &quot;Speedwell&quot; passengers crowded into the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, and the &quot;Speedwell&quot; went on to London to be resold, now with only a few passengers. The &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers, meanwhile, sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees, and finally departed Plymouth, England, on September 6, 1620, bound for the northern part of the Virginia Colony.
On November 9, 1620, lookouts spotted land, but they discovered that they were near Cape Cod and about east-northeast of their planned destination of northern Virginia. They tried briefly to sail south, but strong seas forced them to retreat to Cape Cod to harbor near the hook of Provincetown Harbor. It became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south, so they decided to settle near Cape Cod. Shortage of supplies (including wood and beer) and the roaring Atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a Virginia landing. They anchored at the hook on November 11, and the leaders of the colony wrote the Mayflower Compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle. Myles Standish was one of the 41 men who signed it.

==Establishment of Plymouth Colony==
The Mayflower was anchored off Cape Cod when Standish urged the colony&#x27;s leaders to allow him to take a party ashore to find a suitable place for settlement. On November 15, 1620, he led 16 men on foot in exploration of the northern portion of the Cape. On December 11, he led a group of 18 and made an extended exploration of the shore of Cape Cod by boat, spending their nights ashore surrounded by makeshift barricades of tree branches. They were attacked one night by a group of about 30 Indians. They panicked, but Standish calmed them, urging them not to fire their matchlock muskets unnecessarily. The incident took place in Eastham, Massachusetts, and came to be known as the &quot;First Encounter&quot;.

After further exploration, the Pilgrims chose a location in Plymouth Bay in late December 1620 as the site for their settlement. Standish provided important counsel on the placement of a small fort in which cannon were mounted, and on the layout of the first houses for maximum defensibility. They had built only one single-room house when illness struck. Only 50 survived the first winter out of the 100 or so who arrived on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Standish&#x27;s wife Rose died in January.

Standish was one of the very few who did not fall ill, and William Bradford credited him with comforting many and being a source of strength to those who suffered. Standish tended to Bradford during his illness, and this was the beginning of a decades-long friendship. Bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and, by necessity, worked closely with Standish. The two men were opposites in terms of character; Bradford was patient and slow to judgment, while Standish was well known for his fiery temper. Despite their differences, the two worked well together in managing the colony and responding to dangers as they arose.

==Military action in support of Plymouth Colony==
By February 1621, the colonists had sighted Indians several times, but there had been no communication. The men of the colony were anxious to prepare themselves in case of hostilities, so they formed a militia on February 17, 1621, consisting of all able-bodied men, electing Standish as their commander. The leaders of Plymouth Colony had already hired him for that role, but this vote ratified the decision by democratic process. The men of Plymouth Colony continued to re-elect him to that position for the remainder of his life. As captain of the militia, he regularly drilled his men in the use of pikes and muskets.

Contact with the Indians came in March 1621 through Samoset, an English-speaking Abenaki who arranged for the Pilgrims to meet with Massasoit, the sachem of the nearby Pokanoket tribe. On March 22, Plymouth Colony&#x27;s governor John Carver signed a treaty with Massasoit, declaring an alliance between the Pokanokets and the Colonists and requiring the two parties to defend one another in times of need. Governor Carver died the same year and the responsibility of upholding the treaty fell to his successor William Bradford. Bradford and Standish were frequently preoccupied with the complex task of reacting to threats against both the Pilgrims and the Pokanokets from tribes such as the Massachusetts and the Narragansetts. As threats arose, Standish typically advocated intimidation to deter their rivals. Such behavior at times made Bradford uncomfortable, but he found it an expedient means of maintaining the treaty with the Pokanokets.

===Nemasket raid===

The first challenge to the treaty came in August 1621 when a sachem named Corbitant began to undermine Massasoit&#x27;s leadership. Corbitant worked to turn the people against Massasoit in the Pokanoket village of Nemasket, now the site of Middleborough, Massachusetts, about west of Plymouth. Bradford sent two trusted interpreters to determine what was happening in Nemasket: Tisquantum (known to the English as Squanto) and Hobbamock. Tisquantum had been pivotal in providing counsel and aid to the Pilgrims, ensuring the survival of the colony. Hobbamock was another influential ally, a high-ranking advisor to Massasoit and a warrior who commanded particular respect and fear among the Indians. When Tisquantum and Hobbamock arrived in Nemasket, Corbitant took Tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him. Hobbamock escaped to warn Plymouth.

Bradford and Standish agreed that this represented a dangerous threat to the Plymouth-Pokanoket alliance and decided to act quickly. On August 14, 1621, Standish led a group of 10 men to Nemasket, determined to kill Corbitant. They were guided by Hobbamock who quickly befriended Standish, and the two men were close for the remainder of their lives. In his old age, Hobbamock became part of Standish&#x27;s household in Duxbury.

Reaching Nemasket, Standish planned a night attack on the shelter in which Corbitant was believed to be sleeping. That night, he and Hobbamock burst into the shelter, shouting for Corbitant. As frightened Pokanokets attempted to escape, Standish&#x27;s men outside fired their muskets, wounding a Pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to Plymouth to be treated. Standish soon learned that Corbitant had already fled the village and Tisquantum was unharmed.

Standish had failed to capture Corbitant, but the raid had the desired effect. On September 13, 1621, nine sachems came to Plymouth, including Corbitant, to sign a treaty of loyalty to King James.

===Palisade===

In November 1621, a Narragansett messenger arrived in Plymouth and delivered a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin. Tisquantum and Hobbamock told them that this was a threat and an insult from Narragansett sachem Canonicus. The Narragansetts lived west of Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island and were one of the more powerful tribes in the region. Bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder and shot in an effort to show that they were not intimidated.

Standish took the threat seriously and urged that the colonists encircle their small village with a palisade made of tall, upright logs. The proposal would require a wall more than half a mile (or 0.8 km) long. In addition, he recommended the construction of strong gates and platforms for shooting over the wall. The colony had recently been reinforced by the arrival of new colonists from the ship &quot;Fortune&quot;, but there were still only 50 men to work on the task. Despite the challenges, the settlers constructed the palisade per Standish&#x27;s recommendations in just three months, finishing in March 1622. Standish divided the militia into four companies, one to man each wall, and drilled them in defending the village in the event of attack.

===Wessagusset===
A more serious threat came from the Massachusett tribe to the north and was precipitated by the arrival of a new group of English colonists. In April 1622, the vanguard of a new colony arrived in Plymouth. They had been sent by merchant Thomas Weston to establish a new settlement somewhere near Plymouth. The men chose a site on the shore of the Fore River in Weymouth, Massachusetts, about north of Plymouth, and they called their colony Wessagusset. The settlers of the poorly managed colony infuriated the Massachusett tribe through theft and recklessness. By March 1623, Massasoit had learned that a group of influential Massachusett warriors intended to destroy both the Wessagusset and Plymouth colonies. He warned Plymouth to strike first. One of the colonists of Wessagusset named Phineas Pratt verified that his settlement was in danger. He managed to escape to Plymouth and reported that the colonists in Wessagusset had been repeatedly threatened by the Massachusetts, that the settlement was in a state of constant watchfulness, and that men were dying at their posts from starvation.

Bradford called a public meeting at which the Pilgrims decided to send Standish and a small group of eight, including Hobbamock, to Wessagusset to kill the leaders of the plot. The mission had a personal aspect for Standish. One of the warriors threatening Wessagusset was Wituwamat, a Neponset who had earlier insulted and threatened Standish. Standish arrived at Wessagusset and found that many of the colonists had gone to live with the Massachusetts, and he ordered them to be called back to Wessagusset. Pecksuot was a Massachusett warrior and leader of the group threatening Wessagusset; he came to the settlement with Wituwamat and other warriors the day after Standish&#x27;s arrival. Standish claimed simply to be in Wessagusset on a trading mission, but Pecksuot said to Hobbamock, &quot;Let him begin when he dare; he shall not take us unawares.&quot; Later in the day, Pecksuot approached Standish, looking down on him, and said, &quot;You are a great captain, yet you are but a little man. Though I be no sachem, yet I am of great strength and courage.&quot;

The next day, Standish arranged to meet with Pecksuot over a meal in one of Wessagusset&#x27;s one-room houses. Pecksuot brought Wituwamat, Wituwamat&#x27;s adolescent brother, and several women. Standish had three men of Plymouth and Hobbamock with him in the house. On an arranged signal, they shut the door of the house and Standish attacked Pecksuot, stabbing him repeatedly with the man&#x27;s own knife. Wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed. Standish ordered two more Massachusett warriors to be put to death, then went outside the walls of Wessagusset in search of Obtakiest, a sachem of the Massachusett tribe. They soon encountered Obtakiest with a group of warriors, and a skirmish ensued during which Obtakiest escaped.

Having accomplished his mission, Standish returned to Plymouth with Wituwamat&#x27;s head. The leaders of the plot to destroy the settlements had been killed and the threat removed, but the action had unexpected consequences. The settlement of Wessagusset, which Standish had been trying to protect, was all but abandoned after the incident. Most of the settlers departed for an English fishing post on Monhegan Island. The attack also caused widespread panic among Indian tribes throughout the region. Villages were abandoned and the Pilgrims had difficulty reviving trade for some time.

Pastor John Robinson was still in Leiden, but he criticized Standish for his brutality. Bradford, too, was uncomfortable with his methods, but he defended him in a letter: &quot;As for Capten Standish, we leave him to answer for him selfe, but this we must say, he is as helpfull an instrument as any we have, and as carefull of the generall good.&quot;

===Dispersal of Merrymount settlers===

In 1625, another group of English settlers established an outpost not far from the site of Wessagusset, located in Quincy, Massachusetts, about north of Plymouth. The settlement was officially known as Mount Wollaston, but soon earned the nickname &quot;Merrymount.&quot; Their leader Thomas Morton encouraged behavior that the Pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous. The men of Merrymount built a maypole, drank liberally, refused to observe the Sabbath, and sold weapons to the Indians. Bradford found the weapons sales particularly disturbing and ordered Standish to lead an expedition to arrest Morton in 1628.

Standish arrived with a group of men to find that the small band at Merrymount had barricaded themselves within a small building. Morton eventually decided to attack the men from Plymouth, but the Merrymount group were too drunk to handle their weapons. Morton aimed a weapon at Standish, which the captain ripped from his hands. Standish and his men took Morton to Plymouth and eventually sent him back to England. Later, Morton wrote the book &quot;New English Canaan&quot; in which he referred to Standish as &quot;Captain Shrimp&quot; and added, &quot;I have found the Massachusetts Indians more full of humanity than the Christians.&quot;

===Penobscot expedition===
Standish&#x27;s last significant known expedition was against the French who had established a trading post in 1613 on the Penobscot River in Castine, Maine. English forces captured the settlement in 1628 and turned it over to Plymouth Colony. It was a valuable source of furs and timber for the Pilgrims for seven years. However, the French mounted a small expedition in 1635 and easily reclaimed the settlement. Bradford ordered Standish to take action, determined that the post be reclaimed in Plymouth Colony&#x27;s name. This was a significantly larger proposition than the small expeditions which Standish had previously led and, to accomplish the task, he chartered the ship &quot;Good Hope&quot; captained by a man named Girling. Standish&#x27;s plan appears to have been to bring the &quot;Good Hope&quot; within cannon range of the trading post and to bombard the French into surrendering. Unfortunately, Girling ordered the bombardment before the ship was within range and quickly spent all the gunpowder on board. Standish gave up the effort.

By this time, the neighboring and more populous Massachusetts Bay Colony had been established. Bradford appealed to leaders of the colony in Boston for help in reclaiming the trading post, but the Bay Colony refused. The incident was indicative of the rivalry which persisted between Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies. In 1691, the two were merged to become the royal Province of Massachusetts Bay.

==Settlement in Duxbury==
In 1625, Plymouth Colony leaders appointed Standish to travel to London to negotiate new terms with the Merchant Adventurers. If a settlement could be reached and the Pilgrims could pay off their debt to the Adventurers, then the colonists would have new rights to allot land and settle where they pleased. Standish was not successful in his negotiations and returned to Plymouth in April 1626. Another effort was successful later in 1626, this time negotiated by Isaac Allerton, and several leading men of Plymouth, including Standish, ultimately paid off the colony&#x27;s debt to the Adventurers.

The leaders of Plymouth Colony were now free of the directives of the Merchant Adventurers, and they exerted their newfound autonomy by organizing a land division in 1627. Large farm lots were parceled out to each family in the colony along the shore of Plymouth, Kingston, Duxbury, and Marshfield, Massachusetts. Standish received a farm of in Duxbury, and he built a house and settled there around 1628.

There are indications that Standish began to seek a quieter life by 1635 (after the Penobscot expedition), maintaining the livestock and fields of his Duxbury farm. He was about 51 years old at that time, and he began to relinquish the responsibility of defending the colony to a younger generation. A note in the colony records of 1635 indicates that Lieutenant William Holmes was appointed to train the militia as Standish&#x27;s immediate subordinate. When the Pequot War loomed in 1637, Standish was appointed to a committee to raise a company of 30 men, but it was Holmes who led the company in the field.

The families living in Duxbury (sometimes &quot;Duxborough&quot;) asked to be set off from Plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister; this request was granted in 1637. Historian Justin Winsor and others have insisted that the name of Duxbury was given by Standish in honor of Duxbury Hall, near Chorley in Lancashire, which was owned by a branch of the Standish family. The coincidence would suggest that he had something to do with it, though no records exist to indicate how the town was named.

==Last years==

During the 1640s, Standish took on an increasingly administrative role. He served as a surveyor of highways, as treasurer of the colony from 1644 to 1649, and on various committees to lay out boundaries of new towns and inspect waterways. His old friend Hobbamock had been part of his household, but he died in 1642 and was buried on Standish&#x27;s farm in Duxbury.

Standish died on October 3, 1656, of &quot;strangullion&quot; or strangury, a condition often associated with kidney stones or bladder cancer. He was buried in Duxbury&#x27;s Old Burying Ground, now known as the Myles Standish Cemetery.

==Marriages and family==
Myles Standish married:
* Rose (1601–1621) by 1618. She died the first winter. She was buried in an unmarked grave at Coles Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, as were many others who died the first winter. She is named on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb on Cole&#x27;s Hill as &quot;Rose, first wife of Myles Standish&quot;.
* Barbara by 1624. She had come to Plymouth in 1623 on the &quot;Anne&quot; and they were married the following spring. They had seven children. She died after October 6, 1659, and her burial place is unknown.

Children of Myles and Barbara Standish:
# Charles (1) was born in 1624. He died between May 22, 1627, and 1635.
# Alexander was born about 1626 and died July 6, 1702. He was buried in Myles Standish Burying Ground in Duxbury, Massachusetts. He married Sarah Alden by 1660 and had eight children. She died before June 13, 1688. Her father was &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger John Alden. He then married Desire (Doty) (Sherman) Holmes by 1689 and had three children. She died in Marshfield on January 22, 1731. Her father was &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger Edward Doty.
# John was born about 1627. No further record exists.
# Myles was born about 1629 and died at sea after March 20, 1661. His body was lost at sea. He married Sarah Winslow, a daughter of John Winslow and Mary Chilton, in Boston on July 19, 1660, but there is no record of children.
# Loara (Lora) was born on May 22, 1627, in Plymouth Mass, and died by March 7, 1655. She married Abraham Samson (32) in 1646 when she was 19 years old and had 7 children; Nathaniel Samson, Abraham Samson, Miles Samson, Rebecca Samson, Ebenezer Samson, Sarah Samson, and Grace Samson.
# Josiah was born about 1633 and died in Preston, Connecticut, on March 19, 1690. His burial place is unknown. He married Mary Dingley in Marshfield on December 19, 1654, who died in Duxbury on July 1, 1655. He married Sarah Allen after 1655 and had eight children. She died after September 16, 1690.
# Charles (2) was born by about 1635. He was still living on March 7, 1655/1656. No further record exists.

==Legacy==
Standish&#x27;s true-life role in defending Plymouth Colony and the sometimes brutal tactics that he employed were largely obscured by the fictionalized character created by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his narrative poem &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot;. Historian Tudor Jenks wrote that Longfellow&#x27;s book had &quot;no claim to be considered other than a pleasant little fairystory, and as an entirely misleading sketch of men and matters in old Plymouth.&quot; However, the book elevated Standish to the level of folk hero in Victorian America. In late 19th century Duxbury, the book generated a movement to build monuments in Standish&#x27;s honor, a beneficial byproduct of which was increased tourism to the town.

The first of these monuments was the largest. The cornerstone was laid for the Myles Standish Monument in Duxbury in 1872, with a crowd of ten thousand people attending the ceremonies. It was finished in 1898, the third tallest monument to an individual in the United States. It is surpassed only by the first dedicated Washington Monument () in Baltimore, Maryland (finished in 1829) and the Washington Monument () in Washington, D.C. (dedicated in 1885). The top of the monument is overall, and at the top stands a statue of Standish.

A second, smaller monument was placed over the alleged site of Standish&#x27;s grave in 1893. Two exhumations of Standish&#x27;s remains were undertaken in 1889 and 1891 to determine the location of his resting place. A third exhumation took place in 1930 to place his remains in a hermetically sealed chamber beneath the gravesite monument. His burial site is located in Myles Standish Burial Ground in Duxbury.

The site of Standish&#x27;s house reveals only a slight depression in the ground where the cellar hole was, but it is now a small park owned and maintained by the town of Duxbury. Standish, Maine is named for him, as well as the neighborhood of Standish, Minneapolis. At least two forts were named after him: an earthen fort on Plymouth&#x27;s Saquish Neck built during the American Civil War, and a larger cement fort built on Lovells Island in Boston Harbor in 1895. Both forts are now abandoned. Camp Myles Standish in nearby Taunton was also named for him.

Myles Standish State Forest is located in the towns of Plymouth and Carver in southeastern Massachusetts, approximately 45 miles (70 km) south of Boston. It is the largest publicly owned recreation area in this part of Massachusetts, and is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). Myles Standish Hall is a dormitory at Boston University, originally constructed as the Myles Standish Hotel in 1925. In 2024, Boston University removed Standish&#x27;s name from the building, citing his brutality.

In 2020, Chorley in Lancashire commemorated 400 years of Myles Standish&#x27;s Pilgrim journey. However, many elements of its planned year were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

<text>Nile is an American death metal band from Greenville, South Carolina, formed in 1993. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of founding guitarist/vocalist Karl Sanders, drummer George Kollias, guitarist/vocalist Brian Kingsland, bassist/vocalist Dan Vadim Von and guitarist/vocalist Zach Jeter. The band is known for their dedicated lyrical and musical style, which is inspired by Egyptology and works of H. P. Lovecraft. Since its formation, the band has released ten studio albums, two compilations, three extended plays, two demos, three singles, and five music videos. Their latest studio album, &quot;The Underworld Awaits Us All&quot;, was released on August 23, 2024, through Napalm Records.

== History ==
===1990s===
Nile formed in Greenville, South Carolina in 1993 from a previous band called Morriah, which founding member Karl Sanders had performed in since the 1980s. The name of the band was taken from the Nile river. Nile released a self-titled thrash-influenced demo in 1994 (re-issued in 2011 under the title &quot;Worship the Animal - 1994: The Lost Recordings&quot;). Sanders, vocalist/bassist Chief Spires and drummer Pete Hammoura released the &quot;Festivals of Atonement&quot; EP in 1995, leading Nile to a southwestern tour in support of other metal acts such as Obituary, Deicide, and Broken Hope.

The EP &quot;Ramses Bringer of War&quot; was released by Visceral Productions in 1997. The label was due to release the band&#x27;s first full-length album &quot;Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka&quot;, but went out of business later that year. However, Relapse Records was open to releasing it early on, giving Nile a wider distribution and a chance to tour with Incantation and Morbid Angel. According to Sanders, &quot;The vibe in the late 90s was that death metal was dead. We didn’t care though, because we were going to do whatever we wanted to do, the world be damned. [...] Already we had wrestled with the idea that probably no one was going to give a fuck, so let’s just do what we like and own it. We didn’t care about the ebb and flow of whatever is currently popular.&quot;

===2000s===

The follow-up, &quot;Black Seeds of Vengeance&quot;, was released in September 2000. Prior to the release, drummer Pete Hammoura left the band due to injuries sustained while touring with Catacomb. Derek Roddy stepped in as a session musician to perform on all of the tracks (except &quot;To Dream of Ur&quot;). Also, prior to the album, Dallas Toler-Wade joined as a second guitarist/vocalist. Chief Spires left the band a few months after the release of &quot;Black Seeds of Vengeance&quot;, citing personal and professional differences. He was replaced by Jon Vesano. The band also found new drummer Tony Laureano.

In 2002, &quot;In Their Darkened Shrines&quot; was released. One reviewer noted that the album gave &quot;death metal a cinematic, symphonic twist&quot;. Two videos were shot with director Darren Doane, &quot;Sarcophagus&quot; and &quot;Execration Text&quot;, respectively.

The follow-up album &quot;Annihilation of the Wicked&quot; was released in 2005. Greek drummer George Kollias stepped in to replace Laureano, who left before the recording sessions began. After recording the bass parts for the album, Jon Vesano also left the band. He was temporarily replaced by Joe Payne on the following tour. Another Darren Doane directed video was shot for the song &quot;Sacrifice Unto Sebek&quot;.

In May 2006, Nile signed a recording contract with Nuclear Blast. On February 26, 2007, Nile entered the studio and began recording their fifth full-length album entitled &quot;Ithyphallic&quot;, which was their first release with the label. Karl Sanders had confirmed a release date of June 29, 2007, via a posting on the band&#x27;s message board, which was later pushed back to July 20, 2007. As a special bonus, Nuclear Blast gave several fans the opportunity to listen to the new album two weeks before its release if they could decipher a hieroglyphic message, to which &quot;papyrus&quot; was the answer. Upon the album&#x27;s release, it sold 4,600 copies, which enabled Nile to get onto the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the first time, reaching No. 162 on that chart.

On March 21, 2007, Nile was confirmed as a &quot;Second Stage&quot; act for Ozzfest 2007. A message from Karl Sanders via Nile&#x27;s MySpace profile indicated that they were excited to finally bring true death metal to an Ozzfest audience. From March to April 2008, Nile went on a headlining tour in the United States with Suicide Silence, The Faceless, Unexpect, and Warbringer. From September to October 2008, Nile set out on a European headlining tour with Grave, Omnium Gatherum and Severe Torture. In October 2008, the band planned to take their &quot;Ithyphallic&quot; tour to South Africa for a booking of three shows, but were canceled for unknown reasons.

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album entitled &quot;Those Whom the Gods Detest&quot;. The album was released on November 3, 2009, and was critically well-received, with one reviewer suggesting &quot;pretty much the only thing standing in Nile&#x27;s way at this point is the fact that we as listeners have become so accustomed to the band&#x27;s excellence that another excellent album seems almost par for the course&quot;.

===2010s===

On October 21, 2010, bassist Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new member for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On December 6, 2011, Nile announced work in progress, and the completion of drum tracking, for their upcoming album in 2012.

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record. The next day, he explained on the band&#x27;s official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement. The seventh album &quot;At the Gate of Sethu&quot; was released on June 29, 2012.

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing &quot;unforeseen circumstances beyond my control&quot;. Nile&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;What Should Not Be Unearthed&quot; was released on August 28, 2015.

In the summer of 2016, the band took part in the Summer Slaughter tour. 

In October 2016, after the Summer Slaughter tour, Dallas Toler-Wade left the band, prioritizing his duties with Narcotic Wasteland, and was replaced by Enthean vocalist/guitarist Brian Kingsland. Nile made the announcement in February 2017, In May 2017, the band entered the studio to begin work on their ninth album &quot;Vile Nilotic Rites&quot;, which was released on November 1, 2019.

===2020s===
In July 2022, Sanders confirmed to &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine that Nile has been working on their tenth studio album: &quot;So far, we&#x27;ve got 10 songs written. We&#x27;re probably going to do three more, and hopefully start recording by the end of the summer. Then we&#x27;ve got a European tour coming up in November/December, and after that, we&#x27;ve got to finish the record and hopefully get it out sometime early next year.&quot;

In October 2022 Nile announced Julian Guillen would be joining the band on bass for the upcoming November/December European tour.

On May 29, 2024, Nile released the song &quot;Chapter for Not Being Hung Upside Down on a Stake in the Underworld and Made to Eat Feces by The Four Apes&quot; from the album &quot;The Underworld Awaits Us All&quot;, which was released by Napalm Records on August 23, 2024.

==Musical style and lyrics==
The majority of Nile&#x27;s music is written by vocalist/guitarist Karl Sanders. It combines traditional and technical death metal. Nile&#x27;s music is characterized by the technical death metal genre&#x27;s comparative complexity and speed combined with a riffing style consistent with brutal death metal. Their guitars and bass are typically tuned to dropped A.

Much of the band&#x27;s music and lyrical content is based on Sanders&#x27; interest in Egyptology (mainly inspired by Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern mysticism, history, religion, and ancient art) and other ancient Middle Eastern cultures, such as Mesopotamia. Extensive sleeve notes are included on all Nile&#x27;s full-length releases from &quot;Black Seeds of Vengeance&quot; onwards, with the exception of &quot;Ithyphallic&quot;, explaining the inspiration or source for the lyrics of each song. According to Sanders, &quot;Every song that gets written is filtered through our own lens and our life experiences. [...] You can’t help it that whatever glasses you’re wearing are going to filter how you look at history.&quot; 

Sanders also assessed, &quot;If we were using the music of the local area here, it would sound nothing like a Nile album. In a way it’s a form of escapism. There are a lot of Eastern modalities and tonalities adapted into the guitar playing, but it’s not purely authentic because it can’t be. In the same way that the soundtrack for a mummy movie or whatever is not all ancient stuff from 5000 years ago, it’s music that puts you in that mindset, which is a different thing. Are you scoring a Hollywood movie, or being a musical preservation society? We’re a metal band, so we lean towards the ‘Hollywood making a horrific Ancient Egypt movie’ [approach].&quot; Despite the band&#x27;s heavy use of Eastern tonalities, Sanders also expressed, &quot;It became obvious to us early on that if you put in too many exotic elements, at some point it’s no longer really a metal record. Different Nile albums have had varying levels of extraneous elements to them. [...] It’s always a variable based on what each songs need. It’s the randomness of the universe.&quot;

Metal bands Kittie and Suicide Silence cited Nile as an influence.

<doc id="97778" wikidata="Q34166" url="?curid=97778" title="Slash (musician)">
<text>Saul Hudson (born July 23, 1965), known professionally as Slash, is a British and American musician, best known as the lead guitarist of the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s and mid-1990s. Slash has received critical acclaim and is considered one of the greatest guitarists in history.

Born in Hampstead, London, Slash moved to Los Angeles with his father when he was six years old. His parents were both active in the entertainment industry, and he was given the nickname Slash as a child by actor Seymour Cassel. In 1983 he joined the glam metal band Hollywood Rose, then in 1985 he joined Guns N&#x27; Roses (which was composed of former members of Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns), replacing founding member Tracii Guns.

In 1994, amid growing tensions within Guns N&#x27; Roses, Slash formed the supergroup Slash&#x27;s Snakepit, and in 1996, after growing tensions with Axl Rose, he left Guns N&#x27; Roses. In 2002, he co-founded the supergroup Velvet Revolver with vocalist Scott Weiland, which re-established Slash as a mainstream performer in the mid- to late 2000s. Slash has released two solo albums: &quot;Slash&quot; (2010) and &quot;Orgy of the Damned&quot; (2024) featuring a variety of guest singers, and &quot;Apocalyptic Love&quot; (2012), &quot;World on Fire&quot; (2014), &quot;Living the Dream&quot; (2018) and &quot;4&quot; (2022) with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. He returned to Guns N&#x27; Roses in 2016.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine named him runner-up (to Jimi Hendrix) on their list of &quot;The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players&quot; in 2009, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed him at number 65 on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2011. &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked his guitar solo in &quot;November Rain&quot; number 6 on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Total Guitar&quot; placed his riff in &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; at number 1 on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Riffs&quot; in 2004. Gibson Guitar Corporation ranked Slash as number 34 on their &quot;Top 50 Guitarists of All Time&quot;, while their readers landed him number 9 on Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In 2012, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; classic lineup.

== Early life ==
Saul Hudson was born in Hampstead, London, on July 23, 1965, but raised in Blurton, a small suburb in Stoke-on-Trent, until age 6, before moving to Los Angeles, California. He was named after cartoonist Saul Steinberg. His mother, Ola J. Hudson (née Oliver; 1946–2009), was a black American fashion designer and costumier from the United States. His father, Anthony Hudson, is an English artist. Although there has been speculation, Slash has refuted the claims that his father is Jewish. Of his mixed background, Slash has remarked, &quot;As a musician, I&#x27;ve always been amused that I&#x27;m both British and black; particularly because so many American musicians seem to aspire to be British while so many British musicians, in the &#x27;60s in particular, went to such great pains to be black.&quot;
During his early years, Slash was raised by his father and paternal grandparents in Stoke-on-Trent while his mother moved back to her native United States to work in Los Angeles. When he was around five years old, he and his father joined his mother in Los Angeles. His brother, Albion &quot;Ash&quot; Hudson, was born in 1972. Following his parents&#x27; separation in 1974, Slash became a self-described &quot;problem child&quot;. He chose to live with his mother and was often sent to live with his beloved maternal grandmother whenever his mother had to travel for her job. Slash sometimes accompanied his mother to work, where he met several film and music stars. He was given the nickname &quot;Slash&quot; by actor Seymour Cassel because he was &quot;always in a hurry, zipping around from one thing to another&quot;.

In 1979, Slash decided to form a band with his friend Steven Adler. The band never materialized, but it prompted Slash to take up an instrument. Since Adler had designated himself the role of guitarist, Slash decided to learn how to play bass. During his first lesson, Slash decided to switch from bass to guitar after meeting Robert Wolin, a teacher at Fairfax Music School, and hearing him play &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; by the Rolling Stones and a Cream song. As a result, Slash stated, &quot;When I heard him do that, I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s what I want to do.&#x27;&quot; Equipped with a flamenco guitar given to him by his grandmother, he began taking classes with Wolin. He vividly recalls the feeling after learning &quot;Come Dancing&quot; from &quot;Wired&quot; by Jeff Beck, which he described as &quot;fucking awesome&quot;.

A champion BMX rider, Slash put the bike aside to devote himself to playing guitar, practicing up to 12 hours a day. Slash attended Beverly Hills High School and was a contemporary of musicians Lenny Kravitz and Zoro.

== Career ==
=== 1981–1985: early years ===
Slash joined his first band, Tidus Sloan, in 1981. In 1983, he formed the band Road Crew—named after the Motörhead song &quot;(We Are) The Road Crew&quot;—with his childhood friend Steven Adler, who by then had learned to play drums. He placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking for a bassist, and received a response from Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes. They worked on material that included the main riff of what became the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;. Slash disbanded the group the following year due to them not being able to find a singer, as well as Adler&#x27;s lack of work ethic compared to himself and McKagan. He, along with Adler, then joined a local band known as Hollywood Rose, which featured singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Following his time with Hollywood Rose, Slash played in a band called Black Sheep and auditioned and wasn’t chosen to play in Poison, a glam metal band that he later openly derided.

=== 1985–1996: first stint with Guns N&#x27; Roses ===

In June 1985, Slash was asked by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin to join their new band GunsN&#x27;Roses, along with Duff McKagan and Steven Adler (replacing founding members Tracii Guns, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner, respectively). They played Los Angeles-area nightclubssuch as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadourand opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. Before one of the shows in 1985, Slash shoplifted a black felt top hat and a Native American-style silver concho belt from two stores on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. He then combined the hat with parts of the belt to create a piece of custom headwear for the show. He said he &quot;felt really cool&quot; wearing the hat, and it became his trademark. It was during 1985–1986 that the band wrote most of its classic material, including &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;, and &quot;Paradise City&quot;. As a result of their rowdy and rebellious behavior, Guns N&#x27; Roses quickly received the moniker &quot;Most Dangerous Band in the World&quot;, causing Slash to remark, &quot;For some strange reason, Guns N&#x27; Roses is like the catalyst for controversy, even before we had any kind of record deal.&quot; After being scouted by several major record labels, the band signed with Geffen Records in March 1986.

In July 1987, Guns N&#x27; Roses released its debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, which, as of September 2008, had sold over 28 million copies worldwide, 18million of which were sold in the United States, making it the bestselling debut album of all time in the U.S. In the summer of 1988, the band achieved its only U.S. No. 1 hit with &quot;Sweet Child O&#x27; Mine&quot;, a song spearheaded by Slash&#x27;s guitar riff and solo. In November of that year, Guns N&#x27; Roses released &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot;, which sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&#x27;. As their success grew, so did interpersonal tensions within the band. In 1989, during a show as opening act for the Rolling Stones, Axl Rose threatened to leave the band if certain members of the band did not stop &quot;dancing with Mr. Brownstone&quot;, a reference to their song of the same name about heroin use. Slash was among those who promised to clean up. However, the following year, Adler was fired from the band because of his heroin addiction; he was replaced by Matt Sorum of the Cult.

In May 1991, the band embarked on the two-and-a-half-year-long Use Your Illusion Tour. The following September, Guns N&#x27; Roses released the long-awaited albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, on the U.S. chart, a feat not achieved by any other group. Stradlin abruptly left the band in November; he was replaced by Gilby Clarke of Candy and Kill for Thrills. The tour ended on July 17, 1993. In November of that year, the band released &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, a cover album of mostly punk songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. Slash then wrote several songs for what would have become the follow-up album to the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; double album. Rose and Duff, however, rejected the material.

With the band&#x27;s failure to collaborate resulting in no album being recorded, Slash announced in October 1996 that he was no longer a part of Guns N&#x27; Roses. Slash stated at the time &quot;Axl and I have not been capable of seeing eye to eye on Guns N&#x27; Roses for some time. We tried to collaborate, but at this point, I&#x27;m no longer in the band.&quot; Paul Tobias&#x27;s inclusion in the band was another factor in Slash leaving, with Slash having both &quot;creative and personal&quot; differences with Tobias. However, in his 2007 autobiography, Slash stated that his decision to leave the band was not based on artistic differences with Rose, but on Rose&#x27;s constant lateness to concerts, the alleged legal manipulation Rose used (since denied by Rose) to gain control of the band, and the departures of Adler and Stradlin.

=== 1994–2002: Slash&#x27;s Snakepit ===

In 1994, Slash formed Slash&#x27;s Snakepit, a side project that featured his Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Matt Sorum and Gilby Clarke on drums and rhythm guitar respectively, as well as Alice in Chains&#x27; Mike Inez on bass and Jellyfish&#x27;s Eric Dover on vocals. The band recorded Slash&#x27;s material originally intended for Guns N&#x27; Roses, resulting in the release of &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot; in February 1995. The album was critically praised for ignoring the then-popular conventions of alternative music, and fared well on the charts, eventually selling over one million copies in the U.S. alone despite little promotion from Geffen Records. Slash&#x27;s Snakepit toured in support of the album with bassist James LoMenzo and drummer Brian Tichy of Pride &amp; Glory, before disbanding in 1996. Slash then toured for two years with the blues rock cover band Slash&#x27;s Blues Ball.

In 1999, Slash chose to regroup Slash&#x27;s Snakepit with Rod Jackson on vocals, Ryan Roxie on rhythm guitar, Johnny Griparic on bass, and Matt Laug on drums. Their second album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot;, was released in October 2000 through Koch Records. It did not sell as well as the band&#x27;s previous release, and its critical reception was mixed. To promote the album, the band—with Keri Kelli on rhythm guitar—embarked on an extensive world tour in support of AC/DC in the summer of 2000, followed by their own headlining theater tour. Slash disbanded Snakepit in 2002.

=== 2002–2008: Velvet Revolver ===
In 2002, Slash reunited with Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum for a Randy Castillo tribute concert. Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N&#x27; Roses, they decided to form a new band together. Former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin was initially involved, but left after the others decided to find a lead singer. Dave Kushner, who had previously played with McKagan in Loaded, then joined the band on rhythm guitar. For many months, the four searched for a lead singer by listening to offered demo tapes, a monotonous process documented by VH1. Eventually, former Stone Temple Pilots vocalist Scott Weiland joined the band.

In 2003, Velvet Revolver played several concerts during the summer and released their first single, &quot;Set Me Free&quot;. In June 2004, they released their debut album, &quot;Contraband&quot;, which debuted at No.1 on the U.S. chart and sold two million copies, re-establishing Slash as a mainstream performer. A year-and-a-half-long tour followed in support of the album. In 2005, the band was nominated for three Grammy Awards: Rock Album of the Year, Rock Song, and Hard Rock Performance for their &quot;Contraband&quot; single &quot;Slither&quot; which won their first and only Grammy. In July 2007, Velvet Revolver released their second album, &quot;Libertad&quot;, and embarked on a second tour. During a show in March 2008, Weiland announced to the audience that it would be the band&#x27;s final tour; he was fired from the band in April 2008 and Slash insisted &quot;chemical issues&quot; led to the split. The following month Weiland rejoined Stone Temple Pilots. Despite Weiland&#x27;s departure, Velvet Revolver did not officially disband.

In early 2010, Velvet Revolver began writing new songs and auditioning new singers. By January 2011, the band had recorded nine demos, and was reportedly due to make a decision on their singer. However, the following April, Slash stated that they had been unable to find a suitable singer and that Velvet Revolver would remain on hiatus for the next few years while its members focus on other projects.

=== 2009–present: &quot;Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators&quot; ===


In September 2008, Slash began production on his debut solo album. He described the process of recording by himself as &quot;cathartic&quot;. He also mentioned working on the album gave him a chance to &quot;...take a little bit of a break from all the politics and the democracy that is a band and just sort of do my own thing for a little bit.&quot; Slash&#x27;s wife Perla revealed that many different artists would appear on the album, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be Slash and friends, with everyone from Ozzy to Fergie.&quot; The album, simply titled &quot;Slash&quot;, debuted at No. 3 on the U.S. chart upon its release in April 2010. It featured an all-star roster of guest musicians, including Osbourne, Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold, Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead, Dave Grohl, Chris Cornell and Iggy Pop. The album also features musical collaborations with former Guns N&#x27; Roses members Izzy Stradlin, Steven Adler and Duff McKagan. Preceding the release of the album, Slash had released the Japan-only single &quot;Sahara&quot;, featuring Japanese vocalist Koshi Inaba (from B&#x27;z). It charted at number four on the Oricon Singles Chart, as well number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Japan Hot 100. It was awarded Western &quot;Single of the Year&quot; award at the 24th Japan Gold Disc Award by the RIAJ. To promote the album, Slash embarked on his first solo world tour with Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge—who also appeared on the album—on vocals, Bobby Schneck on rhythm guitar, Todd Kerns on bass, and Brent Fitz on drums. Slash opened for Ozzy Osbourne for a leg of Osbourne&#x27;s Scream World Tour.

Slash began working on his second solo album in June 2011. He collaborated with his touring bandmates Myles Kennedy, Todd Kerns, and Brent Fitz, with the resulting album billed to &quot;Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators&quot;. The album, titled &quot;Apocalyptic Love&quot;, was released on May 22, 2012, debuting at No. 2 on the Canadian Albums Chart. In 2013 Slash received the award for &quot;Best Guitarist of the Year 2012&quot; from &quot;Loudwire&quot;.

Slash embarked on a tour in the summer of 2014, opening for Aerosmith as part of the Let Rock Rule Tour. In May 2014, Slash revealed details of his third solo album &quot;World on Fire&quot;. The album was again billed as &quot;Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators&quot; and was released on September 10, 2014. It debuted at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

In March 2018, Slash revealed that a new album with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators was to be released later in the year. In June 2018, he announced that the album was titled &quot;Living the Dream&quot;, to be released on September 21, 2018. The group tour for the album began in September 2018, starting with a show in Del Mar, California at the KAABOO Del Mar Music Festival. The tour was concluded the U.S. and Canada again 2019 after completing the Asian leg and Hawaii show with Guns N&#x27; Roses. Former touring guitarist Frank Sidoris joined the band full-time for the recording sessions.

In an October 2020 interview with blabbermouth.net, bassist/vocalist Todd Kerns confirmed that there would be a new album in 2021, referred to as &quot;SMKC4&quot;.
On July 26, 2021, it was confirmed that the record was to be released via Gibson&#x27;s new record label Gibson Records in February 2022. On October 18, 2021, Slash officially confirmed via Instagram the first single&#x27;s title &quot;The River is Rising&quot;, along with its release date, October 22, 2021. On October 22, the release day of first single, it was announced that the album &quot;4&quot; would be released on February 11, 2022. The tour was also announced the same day, scheduled to start February 8, 2022, in Portland, Oregon.

=== 2016–present: return to Guns N&#x27; Roses ===

On December 29, 2015, several days after a Guns N&#x27; Roses-related teaser was released to movie theaters, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Slash would rejoin the band to headline Coachella 2016, filling the lead guitarist spot vacated when DJ Ashba left the band. Guns N&#x27; Roses were officially announced as headliners of Coachella on January 4, 2016, with KROQ reporting Slash and Duff McKagan would rejoin the band. Slash performed with Guns N&#x27; Roses for the first time in 23 years during the band&#x27;s secret warmup gig at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on April 1, 2016. The band then embarked on the Not in This Lifetime... Tour, which became a massive success, grossing over $584 million by its conclusion in 2019. In 2021, Slash appeared on his first songs with the band since 1994, &quot;Absurd&quot; and &quot;Hard Skool&quot;. In 2023 the band went on tour again, notably playing both the Glastonbury Festival in England and the Power Trip Festival in Indio, California. They also released a new single, &quot;Perhaps&quot;.

=== Session work ===
In 1991, Slash played lead guitar on the single &quot;Give In to Me&quot; off Michael Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Dangerous&quot;, as well as for the opening skit of the video for the song &quot;Black or White&quot; off the same album. In 1995, he played guitar on &quot;D.S.&quot;, a controversial song from Jackson&#x27;s &quot;HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I&quot; album, and in 1997 appeared on the song &quot;Morphine&quot; off the remix album &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor: History in the Mix&quot;.

Slash also joined Jackson on several occasions on stage, most notably at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards playing with Jackson on &quot;Black or White&quot; (and the introduction of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;). He made two surprise appearances during Jackson&#x27;s 1992 Dangerous World Tour in Spain and Japan and supported the 1999 charity concerts MJ &amp; Friends in Seoul and Munich playing the same set as he did for 1995&#x27;s MTV Video Music Awards. The last time Slash and Jackson shared a stage was on both 2001 Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special concerts in New York City playing &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot;.

Slash played guitar on &quot;Wiggle Wiggle&quot;, the opening song on Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1990 record &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot;. With Dylan&#x27;s direction to &quot;play like (...) Django Reinhardt&quot;, Slash recalls &quot;[he] just learned it on the spot. It was such a simple, yet superb I, IV, V progression that there is really nothing much to say about it.&quot; The following year, he collaborated with Lenny Kravitz on &quot;Always on the Run&quot;, the lead single from Kravitz&#x27; album &quot;Mama Said&quot;. In 1993, Slash appeared on the album &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;, performing &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot; with Paul Rodgers and Band of Gypsys. Slash also guest appeared in Carole King&#x27;s 1994 live concert, which was captured on her &quot;Carole KingIn Concert&quot; album. Slash and King appeared on David Letterman to promote the concert. In 1996, he collaborated with Marta Sánchez to record the flamenco-inspired song &quot;Obsession Confession&quot; for the &quot;Curdled&quot; soundtrack. Later that year, he played with Alice Cooper at Sammy Hagar&#x27;s club Cabo Wabo in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The show was released the following year as &quot;A Fistful of Alice&quot;.

Also in 1997, he played on the single &quot;But You Said I&#x27;m Useless&quot; by Japanese musician J. That same year, he contributed music to the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;; several compositions by Slash&#x27;s Snakepit can be heard throughout the film. He also appeared on the Insane Clown Posse album &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; on the track &quot;Halls of Illusions&quot;.

=== Other ventures ===
A self-described &quot;film buff&quot;, Slash has had small parts in several films and television series. In 1988, he appeared with his GunsN&#x27;Roses bandmates in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film &quot;The Dead Pool&quot;, in which his character attends a musician&#x27;s funeral and shoots a harpoon. He played radio DJ Hank in a 1994 episode of the horror anthology television series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. Slash was a guest star in an episode of the live-action/animated talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; on Cartoon Network, where Space Ghost, Zorak, and Moltar teach him how to do guitar licks, but he refuses to do any of that. In 1999, he appeared as the host of the Miss America Bag Lady pageant in the widely panned film &quot;The Underground Comedy Movie&quot;. He has also appeared as himself in several projects, including Howard Stern&#x27;s &quot;Private Parts&quot; in 1997, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; in 1998, &quot;MADtv&quot; in 2005, and Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Brüno&quot; in 2009.

As in real life, Slash is Evans&#x27; close friend and next-door neighbor on the show. He played Billy Butterface in the television show &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; on Adult Swim. On May 5, 2009, he appeared as the guest mentor for the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll week of &quot;American Idol&quot;. In 2010, Slash formed Slasher Films, a horror film production company. Its first film, &quot;Nothing Left to Fear&quot;, was screened in select cities on October 4, 2013, before being released on DVD and Blu-ray the following Tuesday. Slash appeared on the October 26, 2014 episode of &quot;Talking Dead&quot;. He is reported to be a massive fan of horror movies.

Slash&#x27;s autobiography, simply titled &quot;Slash&quot;, was published on October 30, 2007. It was co-written with Anthony Bozza. Slash also made several contributions to &quot;The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star&quot;, the autobiography of Mötley Crüe bassist and back-up singer Nikki Sixx, which was also published in 2007.

Slash is a pinball enthusiast and collector. He participated in the design process for the 1994 Data East &quot;GunsN&#x27;Roses&quot; pinball machine, as well as the 2020 Jersey Jack Pinball machine of the same theme, and provided music for the 1998 Sega machine &quot;Viper Night Drivin&quot;&#x27;. Slash is a playable character in the video game &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, released in 2007. His performance was motion captured to record his movements for the game. Slash&#x27;s character becomes playable after a player beats him in a one-on-one competition, which then leads to the player and Slash playing the master track of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;. Guitar learning game/simulator &quot;Rocksmith 2014&quot; by Ubisoft released a Slash Song Pack with several of the latter compositions by the artist available to purchase as downloadable content and learn on the guitar.

A keen artist, Slash designed logos and artwork for several of his pre-Guns N&#x27; Roses bands, as well as the famous circular GN&#x27;R logo. He is also credited as having provided some artwork for Aerosmith&#x27;s 2012 album, &quot;Music From Another Dimension!&quot;, as it reproduces a picture of the band drawn by Slash when he was still a teenager.

Slash is a fan of the &quot;Angry Birds&quot; series of video games, and created a hard rock version of the &quot;Angry Birds Space&quot; theme song. In addition, Slash has a &quot;Birds&quot; avatar shown in the game, released in March 2013.

== Personal life ==
Slash is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States. A British national since his birth, he has resided in Los Angeles since 1971, but did not acquire American citizenship until 1996. He said in 2010, &quot;I do consider myself British. I have very strong feelings about my British heritage. My first years were there, I went to school there, and I have seemingly endless family on that side of the pond. So I&#x27;ve always felt most comfortable in England.&quot;

In 2001, at the age of 35, Slash was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a form of congestive heart failure, caused by his many years of alcohol and drug abuse. Originally given between six days and six weeks to live, he survived through physical therapy and the implantation of a defibrillator. Slash has been clean and sober since 2006, which he credited to his then-wife Perla Ferrar. In 2009, following his mother&#x27;s death from lung cancer, he quit smoking.

Slash&#x27;s friendship with GunsN&#x27;Roses frontman Axl Rose soured following his departure from the band. In 2006, Rose claimed that Slash had shown up at his house uninvited the previous year to offer a truce. He alleged that Slash had insulted his Velvet Revolver bandmates, telling Rose that he considered Scott Weiland &quot;a fraud&quot;, and Duff McKagan &quot;spineless&quot;, and that he &quot;hated&quot; Matt Sorum. Slash denied the accusations. In his 2007 autobiography, he admitted to visiting Rose&#x27;s home with the intention to settle a longstanding legal dispute, and to make peace with his former bandmate. He claims, however, that he did not speak with Rose and instead merely left a note. Slash maintained that he had not spoken with Rose in person since 1996. In 2009, in response to a statement by Rose in which he referred to Slash as &quot;a cancer&quot;, Slash commented: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t really affect me at all... It&#x27;s been a long time. The fact that he has anything to say at all, it&#x27;s like, &#x27;Whatever, dude.&#x27; It doesn&#x27;t really matter.&quot; In an August 2015 interview, Slash stated that he and Rose had reconciled. He subsequently rejoined Guns N&#x27; Roses in 2016. Slash later stated about the feud that &quot;We had a lot of issues born out of third-party stuff. It was very insidious, and the longer we didn’t talk, the more it got blown out of proportion&quot;.

=== Family ===

On October 10, 1992, Slash married model-actress Renée Suran in Marina del Rey, California. They divorced in late 1997 after five years of marriage.

Slash married Perla Ferrar on October 15, 2001, in Hawaii. They have two sons. Slash filed for divorce from Ferrar in August 2010, but the couple reconciled two months later. In December 2014, he again filed for divorce. London debuted his band Suspect208 in late 2020. The band also featured Robert Trujillo&#x27;s son Tye Trujillo on bass, and Scott Weiland&#x27;s son Noah Weiland on vocals. Slash promoted the band on his social media accounts.

Slash is currently in a relationship with Meegan Hodges whom he first dated in 1989 and reconnected with in 2015.

=== Philanthropy ===
Slash is an honorary board member of Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit that works to restore and rejuvenate music education programs in disadvantaged public schools. He has visited Little Kids Rock students, jammed with them, and donated instruments and his time. Slash&#x27;s passion for music is evident in his charity as well as his art. &quot;Being a musician is good for the character because it teaches you a lot about discipline&quot;, Slash said. &quot;I think it&#x27;s a great creative outlet.&quot;

Slash has been recognized for his longtime contributions to establishing environmental welfare programs. He is a board trustee of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, and has long supported the Los Angeles Zoo and zoos around the world. Slash&#x27;s love of reptiles was, for many years, a notable aspect of his public persona, with several of his many snakes appearing with him in music videos and photoshoots, until the birth of his first son in 2002 impelled him to find a new home for his collection.

=== Legal issues ===
In 1985, Slash and Axl Rose were charged with statutory rape after Rose slept with a 15-year-old girl named Michelle Rhoades. Both went into hiding to avoid the police and the charges were dropped several weeks later due to lack of evidence. Slash was arrested in July 1999 for allegedly assaulting his then-girlfriend.

== Accolades ==

Slash has received critical acclaim as a guitarist. In 2005, he was named &quot;Best Guitarist&quot; by &quot;Esquire&quot;, which congratulated him on &quot;beating the comeback odds with a surprisingly legitimate and vital outfit, Velvet Revolver.&quot; Slash was awarded the title of &quot;Riff Lord&quot; during &quot;Metal Hammer&#x27;s&quot; fourth annual Golden Gods awards in 2007. In 2008, he was ranked No.21 on Gigwise&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Guitarists Ever&quot;, and in 2009, he was named runner-up on &quot;The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players&quot; list in &quot;Time&quot;, which praised him as &quot;a remarkably precise player&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed Slash at No. 65 on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

In 2007, Slash was honored with a star on the Rock Walk of Fame; his name was placed alongside Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix. He was the honoree at the 2010 Sunset Strip Music Festival, where he was presented by West Hollywood mayor John Heilman with a plaque declaring August 26 as &quot;Slash Day&quot;. In 2012, Slash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the classic lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses. He performed three songs—&quot;Paradise City&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; and &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;with fellow inductees Duff McKagan, Steven Adler, and Matt Sorum, one-time Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke, and his frequent collaborator Myles Kennedy. Inductees Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin and Dizzy Reed declined to attend. Later that year, Slash received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located directly in front of the Hard Rock Cafe on Hollywood Boulevard.

In 2004, Slash&#x27;s introductory riff in &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; was voted No.1 on a list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Riffs&quot; by the readers of &quot;Total Guitar&quot;; his riffs in &quot;Out ta Get Me&quot; (No.51), &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; (No. 21), and &quot;Paradise City&quot; (No.19) also made the list. In 2006, his solo in &quot;Paradise City&quot; was voted No.3 by &quot;Total Guitar″s&quot; readers on a list of &quot;The 100 Hottest Guitar Solos&quot;; his solos in &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; and &quot;November Rain&quot; were ranked No.30 and No.82 respectively. In 2008, &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed Slash&#x27;s solo in &quot;November Rain&quot; at No.6 on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot;, while his solo in &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; was ranked No.37 on the list. In 2010, the readers of &quot;Total Guitar&quot; voted his riff in &quot;Slither&quot; runner-up on the list of &quot;The 50Greatest Riffs of the Decade&quot;, while his riff in &quot;By the Sword&quot; was ranked No.22. Slash received a Radio Contraband Rock Radio Award in 2012. In January 2015 Slash received the Les Paul award.

== Equipment ==
Slash owns more than 100 guitars, worth a total of $1.92 million. He prefers the Gibson Les Paul, which he has called &quot;the best all-around guitar for me.&quot; Gibson has credited him and Zakk Wylde with bringing the Les Paul back into the mainstream in the late 1980s. His main studio guitar is a 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard replica, built by luthier Kris Derrig, which he came to own during the recording sessions for Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. He used that guitar on every subsequent album he recorded with Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver. For many years, his main live guitar was a 1988 Gibson Les Paul Standard.

Since 1997, Slash has collaborated with Gibson on seventeen signature Les Paul models: five through Gibson USA; seven through the Gibson Custom Shop; and five through the Gibson subsidiary Epiphone. Slash also plays various other Gibson guitars, including Firebirds and Explorers. He also plays or has played guitars by a plethora of other brands, including B.C. Rich with whom he has designed several custom models based on their Mockingbird and Bich designs. He has used guitars by Fender, Gretsch, Jackson, and Martin. He has also collaborated on signature equipment with other companies. In 1996, Marshall introduced the Marshall Slash Signature JCM2555, an authentic reissue of the Marshall &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; JCM2555 released in 1987. It was the first signature amp ever produced by Marshall, with production limited to 3000. In 2007, Jim Dunlop introduced the Crybaby SW-95 Slash Signature Wah, designed after Slash&#x27;s own custom-built Crybaby wah pedal. In 2010, Seymour Duncan introduced the Alnico II Pro Slash APH-2 pickups, which were designed to recreate the tone of Slash&#x27;s main studio guitar. The Slash signature pickups were marketed through Seymour Duncan&#x27;s YouTube channel with product demonstrator Danny Young performing the official videos. Also in 2010, Marshall introduced the Marshall AFD100, a recreation of the Marshall 1959 that Slash used for the recording of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, with production limited to 2300.

On stage, Slash prefers Marshall amplifiers, particularly the Marshall &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; JCM2555 amp. He used a rented early-1970s Marshall 1959 for the recording of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. Slash enjoyed the amp so much that he tried to keep it, telling the rental company, S.I.R., that it had been stolen. However, the amp was repossessed by S.I.R. employees after a roadie accidentally brought it to rehearsals at the store. For the recording of Velvet Revolver&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Contraband&quot;, he used a Vox AC30 amp and small Fender tube amps, and on their second album, &quot;Libertad&quot;, he used the Marshall &quot;Vintage Modern&quot; 2466 amp. On his eponymous debut solo album he used a Marshall JCM800, issued as &quot;#34&quot;, and later, on the subsequent world tour, Slash used his signature Marshall AFD100 amp.

<text>Robert Oxton Bolt (15 August 1924 – 20 February 1995) was an English playwright and a screenwriter, known for writing the screenplays for &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, and &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, the latter two of which won him the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Career==
He was born in Sale, Cheshire, to Methodist parents; his father owned a small furniture shop. At Manchester Grammar School his affinity for Sir Thomas More first developed. After leaving school aged sixteen, he worked in an insurance office, which he disliked; after studying in the evening for five weeks he passed three A-levels and went on to attend the University of Manchester, from which, after a year, he undertook wartime service, initially as a pilot officer candidate in the RAF (air-sickness preventing him from continuing past training) from 1943 to 1946. He then served as an Army officer in West Africa until 1947, when he returned to the University of Manchester and spent three years completing his honours degree in history. Following this, he took a teaching diploma from the University of Exeter. For many years he taught in the English and History departments at Millfield School and only became a full-time writer at the age of 33 when his play &quot;The Flowering Cherry&quot; was staged in London in 1958, with Celia Johnson and Ralph Richardson.

He first earned notice for his original play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; – a depiction of Sir Thomas More&#x27;s clash with King Henry VIII over his divorce from Catherine of Aragon – which won awards on the stage and in its film version, though subsequently most of his writing was screenplays for films or television.

Bolt&#x27;s writing included primarily dramatic works that placed their protagonists in tension with the prevailing society. He won praise for &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, his first iteration of this theme, but he developed it in his existential script for &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962). In &quot;Lawrence&quot;, he succeeded where several before him had failed at turning T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; into a cogent screenplay by transforming the entire book into a search for the identity of its author, presenting Lawrence as a misfit both in English and Arab society.

It was at this time that Bolt himself fell foul of the law, and as part of the Committee of 100 he was arrested and imprisoned for protesting against nuclear proliferation. He refused to be &quot;bound over&quot; (i.e., to sign a declaration that he would not engage in such activities again) and was sentenced to one month in prison because of this. Sam Spiegel, the producer of &quot;Lawrence&quot;, persuaded Bolt to sign after he had served only two weeks. Bolt later regretted his actions and did not speak to Spiegel again after the film was completed.

Later in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, Bolt invested Boris Pasternak&#x27;s novel with his own characteristic sense of narrative and dialogue – human, short and telling. &quot;The Bounty&quot; was Bolt&#x27;s first project after a stroke, which resulted in some loss of speech and partial paralysis. In it, Fletcher Christian takes the &quot;Lawrence&quot; role of a man in tension with his society who in the process loses touch with his own identity. &quot;The Mission&quot; was Bolt&#x27;s final film project, and it once again represented his thematic preoccupations, this time with 18th-century Jesuits in South America.

Bolt&#x27;s final produced script was &quot;Political Animal&quot;, later made into the TV movie &quot;Without Warning: The James Brady Story&quot; (1991), about the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan and the struggles of his press secretary James Brady to recover from a near-fatal gunshot injury he received in the process. Bolt was initially reluctant to make the film, but after meeting Brady he felt he could relate to Brady&#x27;s struggles with a head injury, and many of his own experiences recovering from his stroke found their way into the script.

==Personal life==
Bolt was married four times, twice to British actress Sarah Miles. His first wife was Celia Ann &quot;Jo&quot; Roberts, by whom he had three children: Sally (died 1982), Ben, and Joanna. They divorced in 1963. He was married to Miles from 1967 until 1976; Bolt had his fourth child, Thomas, with Miles. In the early 1980s, he had a third marriage, to the actress Ann Queensberry (former wife of David Douglas, 12th Marquess of Queensberry), before remarrying Sarah Miles in 1988, with whom he remained until his death in 1995.

After the war, Bolt joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, but he left it in the late 1960s after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.

==Death==
Bolt suffered a heart attack and a stroke that left him paralysed in 1979. He died aged 70 in 1995, in Petersfield, Hampshire, England, following a long illness.

==Honours==
Robert Bolt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1972 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List for his services to drama.

==Works==

===Plays===
Bolt wrote several plays for BBC Radio in the 1950s, as well as several unproduced plays. Many of his early radio plays were for children, with few adapted for the stage.

* &quot;The Last of the Wine&quot; (1955) – A play showcasing the reactions of ordinary Englishmen to the advent of nuclear armageddon, one of Bolt&#x27;s pet political issues. One of Bolt&#x27;s radio plays which Bolt tried to adapt to the stage. However, the play was either never performed or performed a few times and then cancelled. &quot;Wine&quot; has never been published or performed since. First broadcast late March or early April 1955 on the BBC Third Programme.
* &quot;Flowering Cherry&quot; (1958) – concerns a middle-aged man, an insurance salesman dissatisfied with his life who retreats into his fantasies of owning a cherry orchard. His erratic behaviour alienates family and friends and threatens his financial ruin. Ran on the West End starring Ralph Richardson and Celia Johnson (succeeded by Wendy Hiller) to success but mixed reviews. Many critics felt it too closely resembled Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, and had a brief but unsuccessful run on Broadway starring Hiller and Eric Portman.
* &quot;The Tiger and the Horse&quot; (1960) – is the first of Bolt&#x27;s plays to develop his themes of individualism, society, authority, and politics. It concerns an ageing college professor, John Dean, who is running for Vice-Chancellor of a prestigious university, but finds his election undermined by his daughter&#x27;s love affair, a political petition, and his wife&#x27;s deteriorating mental state. The play starred Michael and Vanessa Redgrave, among others, and was directed by Frith Banbury.
* &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1960) – involves Sir Thomas More&#x27;s conflict with Henry VIII over the latter&#x27;s break with the Catholic Church. Adapted from a radio play Bolt had written in 1954, it is generally regarded as Bolt&#x27;s finest work – and certainly his most successful. The BBC production was reviewed in the &quot;Listener&quot; on 5 August 1954. The play develops in full his themes of individuality versus society and authority as corrupt. The strain of Brechtianism which would pervade many of his later works is first present here, in the character of the &#x27;Common Man&#x27;, who both narrates and takes part in the action as various minor characters. The original run starred Paul Scofield as Thomas More, as well as Keith Baxter as Henry VIII, George Rose as the Common Man, Leo McKern as the Common Man in the West End production and Thomas Cromwell in the Broadway show (a role originated in London by Andrew Keir and later taken over by Thomas Gomez), and Albert Dekker as the Duke of Norfolk. It was a huge critical and commercial success on both sides of the Atlantic, has had several revivals, and was made into an equally acclaimed film in 1966.
* &quot;Vivat! Vivat Regina!&quot; (1971) – Bolt&#x27;s most successful show after &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, a historical account of the reigns of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Elizabeth I of England, comparing and contrasting the personalities and reigns of the two female rulers. Highly successful, it ran for several months on Broadway, earning several Tony nominations. The original cast included Eileen Atkins as Elizabeth and Bolt&#x27;s wife Sarah Miles as Mary. The play has experienced several revivals, most notably a 1985 Off-Broadway production starring Geraldine Page as Elizabeth.
* &quot;State of Revolution&quot; (1977) – An in-depth political depiction of the Russian Revolution of 1917, focusing on Vladimir Lenin as &quot;a great man possessed by a terrible idea&quot;, and the struggles of Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin to gain power under him. It is told from the point of view of Lunacharsky, Lenin&#x27;s Minister of Education. The original cast included Michael Bryant as Lenin, Terence Rigby as Stalin, Brian Blessed as Maxim Gorky and Michael Kitchen as Trotsky. Though meticulously researched, the play received mixed reviews. Bolt himself felt that he had not written the play as well as he might have done.

===Screenplays===
Bolt may be best remembered for his work on film and television screenplays. His work for director David Lean garnered him particular acclaim and recognition, and Bolt tried his hand at directing with the unsuccessful &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (1972). While some criticised Bolt for focusing more on the personal aspects of his protagonists than the broader political context (particularly with &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;), most critics and audiences alike praised his screenplays. Bolt won two Oscars, two BAFTA Awards and won or was nominated for several others.

* &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (with Michael Wilson) (1962) – despite disputes between Wilson and Bolt over who contributed what to the script, Bolt provided most of the film&#x27;s dialogue and the interpretation of the characters while Wilson provided the characters and scenes in an initial draft screenplay. Wilson was uncredited at the time of the film&#x27;s release, and Bolt alone was nominated for, but did not win, an Academy Award. Bolt and Lean refused to recognise Wilson&#x27;s contribution to the film, and Wilson was not credited until 1995.
* &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965) – Bolt won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay
* &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966) – Bolt won the Oscar again, adapting his own play to the screen.
* &quot;The Red Tent&quot; (1969) (uncredited additional dialogue)
* &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970)
* &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (1972) (also directed)
* &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984)
* &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986) (originally published as a novel)
* &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1988)
* &quot;A Dry White Season&quot; (1989) (uncredited revisions of screenplay)
* &quot;Without Warning: The James Brady Story&quot; (1991) (TV)

Bolt also had several unrealised projects, including a TV miniseries adaptation of Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;Burr&quot;; a film adaptation of Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s novel &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; for Norman Lear; a script inspired by the Patty Hearst kidnapping called &quot;The Cover-Up&quot; with Oliver Stone; a script about Irish patriot Michael Collins called &quot;Blest Souls&quot; with Michael Cimino; original screenplays about Galileo Galilei and explorers Scott and Amundsen; a film adaptation of André Malraux&#x27;s novel &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot; also with Cimino; and a script about the life of Siddhartha called &quot;Buddha&quot; for Ron Fricke. Additionally, Bolt was briefly attached as writer for &quot;Gandhi&quot; and David Lean&#x27;s unmade film version of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Nostromo&quot;, before he was replaced on both.

After being paid $US400,000 plus ten per cent of profits for his &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; screenplay, Bolt became, for a time, the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood.

<doc id="97785" wikidata="Q2352389" url="?curid=97785" title="Walrus ivory">
<text>Walrus ivory, also known as morse, comes from two modified upper canines of a walrus. The tusks grow throughout life and may, in the Pacific walrus, attain a length of one metre. Walrus teeth are commercially carved and traded; the average walrus tooth has a rounded, irregular peg shape and is approximately 5 cm in length.

The tip of a walrus tusk has a tooth enamel coating which is worn away during the animal&#x27;s youth. Fine longitudinal cracks, which appear as radial cracks in cross-section, originate in the cementum and penetrate the dentine. These cracks can be seen throughout the length of the tusk. Whole cross-sections of walrus tusks are generally oval with widely spaced indentations. The dentine is composed of two types: primary dentine and secondary (often called osteodentine). Primary dentine has a classical ivory appearance. Secondary dentine is marble or oatmeal-like.

==Carving==
Walrus-ivory carving and engraving has been an important folk art for people of the Arctic since prehistoric times, among them the Inuit, Inupiaq and Yupik of Greenland and North America and the Chukchi and Koryak of Russia. The Chukchi and Bering Sea Yupik in particular continue to produce ivory. The folk art of walrus-ivory carving has been popular in European Russia since the Middle Ages, with notable schools of walrus-ivory carving in Kholmogory and Tobolsk. During Soviet times, several walrus carving collectives were established in villages in Chukotka, notably Uelen. International trade is, however, somewhat restricted by the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES).

In the Early Medieval period, when supplies of elephant ivory reaching Europe reduced or ceased after the Muslim conquests, walrus ivory began to be traded by Vikings into northern Europe as a replacement. King Alfred the Great of Wessex records that he was presented with walrus tusks by the Viking trader Ohthere of Hålogaland in about 890, which may mark the start of this trade. Nearly all ivories in Anglo-Saxon art use walrus, and most northern European ivories of the 11th and 12th centuries. Initially large walrus herds were found much further south than is the case today, and it is likely that their hunting for ivory greatly impacted on populations. Around 1160 northern European ivory carving was greatly reduced, which may well be because the material was less easily available. Around 1260, at the start of the Gothic period, elephant ivory began to reach Europe again, and the industry greatly increased. The Norse also carved items in walrus ivory, notably the Lewis chessmen.

<text>Alfred Zinnemann (April 29, 1907 – March 14, 1997) was an Austrian-American film director and producer. He won four Academy Awards for directing and producing films in various genres, including thrillers, westerns, film noir and play adaptations. He began his career in Europe before emigrating to the US, where he specialized in shorts before making 25 feature films during his 50-year career.

He was among the first directors to insist on using authentic locations and for mixing stars with non-professional actors to give his films more realism. Within the film industry, he was considered a maverick for taking risks and thereby creating unique films, with many of his stories being dramas about lone and principled individuals tested by tragic events. According to one historian, Zinnemann&#x27;s style demonstrated his sense of &quot;psychological realism and his apparent determination to make worthwhile pictures that are nevertheless highly entertaining.&quot;

Among his films were &quot;The Search&quot; (1948), &quot;The Men&quot; (1950), &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959), &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960), &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966), &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), and &quot;Julia&quot; (1977). His films received 65 Oscar nominations, winning 24; Zinnemann himself was nominated for ten, and won Best Director for &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), Best Picture and Best Director for &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966), and Best Documentary, Short Subjects for &quot;Benjy&quot; (1951).

Zinnemann directed and introduced a number of stars in their American film debuts, including Marlon Brando, Rod Steiger, Pier Angeli, Julie Harris, Brandon deWilde, Montgomery Clift, Shirley Jones and Meryl Streep. He directed 19 actors to Oscar nominations, including Frank Sinatra, Montgomery Clift, Audrey Hepburn, Glynis Johns, Paul Scofield, Robert Shaw, Wendy Hiller, Jason Robards, Vanessa Redgrave, Jane Fonda, Gary Cooper and Maximilian Schell.

==Early life==

Zinnemann was born in Rzeszów, the son of Anna (Feiwel) and Oskar Zinnemann, a doctor. His parents were Austrian Jews. He had one younger brother.

Zinnemann grew up in Vienna during the First World War, during much of which his father was serving as a combat medic with the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front. Zinnemann later recalled that his father was severely traumatized by his war experiences and often suffered from nightmares.

While growing up in the First Austrian Republic, which had been formed as a rump state of a fallen Empire in 1918 and which he later described as, &quot;a tiny, defeated, impoverished country&quot;, Zinnemann wanted to become a musician, but went on to graduate with a law degree from the University of Vienna in 1927.

While studying law, he became drawn to films and convinced his parents to let him study film production in the Third French Republic. After studying for a year at the Ecole Technique de Photographie et Cinématographie in Paris, Zinnemann became a cameraman and found work on a number of films being made at Babelsberg Studio in Berlin, during the Weimar Republic, before emigrating to the United States. Both of Zinnemann&#x27;s parents, whom he later described as nostalgic for the days of the Habsburg Monarchy, came back to Poland after Anschluss where later they were murdered by Germans during the Holocaust. Up until their death Zimmerman was exchanging letters with them, all written in Polish.

==Career as director==

===Early career===
Zinnemann worked in Germany with several other beginners (Billy Wilder and Robert Siodmak also worked with him on the 1929 feature &quot;People on Sunday&quot;) after he studied filmmaking in France. His penchant for realism and authenticity is evident in his first feature &quot;The Wave&quot; (1936), shot on location in Mexico with mostly non-professional actors recruited among the locals, which is one of the earliest examples of social realism in narrative film. Earlier in the decade, in fact, Zinnemann had worked with documentarian Robert Flaherty, &quot;probably the greatest single influence on my work as a filmmaker&quot;, he said.

Although he was fascinated by the artistic culture of Germany, with its theater, music and films, he was also aware that the country was in a deep economic crisis. He became disenchanted with Berlin after continually seeing decadent ostentation and luxury existing alongside desperate unemployment. The wealthy classes were moving more to the political right and the poor to the left. &quot;Emotion had long since begun to displace reason,&quot; he said. As a result of the changing political climate, along with the fact that sound films had arrived in Europe, which was technically unprepared to produce their own, film production throughout Europe slowed dramatically. Zinnemann, then only 21, got his parents&#x27; permission to go to America where he hoped filmmaking opportunities would be greater.

He arrived in New York at the end of October 1929, at the time of the stock market crash. Despite the financial panic then beginning, he found New York to be a different cultural environment:
Shortly after, he took a Greyhound bus to Hollywood. One of Zinnemann&#x27;s first jobs in Hollywood was as an extra in &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930). He said that many of the other extras were former Russian aristocrats and high-ranking officers who fled to America as refugees from the October Revolution in 1917 and the ensuing Red Terror.

He was twenty-two but he said he felt older than the forty-year-olds in Hollywood. But he was jubilant because he was then certain that &quot;this was the place one could breathe free and belong.&quot; But after a few years he became disillusioned with the limited talents of Hollywood&#x27;s elites. His first directorial effort was the Mexican cultural protest film, &quot;The Wave&quot;, in Alvarado, Mexico. He established residence in North Hollywood with Henwar Rodakiewicz, Gunther von Fritsch and Ned Scott, all fellow contributors to the Mexican project. 

===1940s===

After some directing success with some short films, he graduated to features in 1942, turning out two B mysteries, &quot;Kid Glove Killer and&quot; &quot;Eyes in the Night&quot; before getting his big break with &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; (1944), starring Spencer Tracy, which became his first hit. The film was based on Anna Seghers&#x27; novel and, while filmed entirely on the MGM backlot, made realistic use of refugee German actors in even the smallest roles. The central character—an escaped prisoner played by Tracy—is seen as comparatively passive and fatalistic. He is, however, the subject of heroic assistance from anti-Nazi Germans. In a sense, the most dynamic character of the film is not the Tracy character but a humble German worker played by Hume Cronyn, who changes from Nazi sympathizer to active opponent of the regime as he aids Tracy.

After World War II, Zinnemann learned that both of his parents had been murdered in the Holocaust. He was frustrated by his studio contract, which dictated that he did not have a choice in directing films like &quot;Little Mister Jim&quot; (1946) and &quot;My Brother Talks to Horses&quot; (1947) despite his lack of interest in their subject matter. However, his next film, &quot;The Search&quot; (1948), won an Oscar for screenwriting and secured his position in the Hollywood establishment. Shot in war-ravaged Germany, the film stars Montgomery Clift in his screen debut as a GI who cares for a lost Czech boy traumatized by the war. It was followed by &quot;Act of Violence&quot; (1948), a gritty film noir starring Van Heflin as a haunted POW, Robert Ryan as his hot-tempered former friend, Janet Leigh as Heflin&#x27;s wife, and Mary Astor as a sympathetic prostitute. Zinnemann considered &quot;Act of Violence&quot; the first project in which he &quot;felt comfortable knowing exactly what I wanted and exactly how to get it.&quot;

===1950s===
&quot;The Men&quot; (1950) stars Marlon Brando as a paraplegic war veteran. It was Brando&#x27;s first film. Zinnemann filmed many scenes in a California hospital where real patients served as extras. It was followed by &quot;Teresa&quot; (1951), starring Pier Angeli.

Perhaps Zinnemann&#x27;s best-known work is &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), one of the first 25 American films chosen in 1989 for the National Film Registry. With its psychological and moral examinations of its lawman hero Marshall Will Kane, played by Gary Cooper and its innovative chronology whereby screen time approximated the 80-minute countdown to the confrontational hour, the film broke the mold of the formulaic western. Working closely with cinematographer and longtime friend Floyd Crosby, he shot without filters, giving the landscape a harsh &quot;newsreel&quot; quality that clashed with the more painterly cinematography of John Ford&#x27;s westerns. During production he established a strong rapport with Gary Cooper, photographing the aging actor in many tight close-ups which showed him sweating, and at one point, even crying on screen.

Screenwriter Carl Foreman apparently intended &quot;High Noon&quot; to be an allegory of Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s vendetta against alleged Communists. However, Zinnemann disagreed, insisting, late in life, that the issues in the film, for him, were broader, and were more about conscience and independent, uncompromising fearlessness. He says, &quot;&quot;High Noon&quot; is &quot;not a Western, as far as I&#x27;m concerned; it just happens to be set in the Old West.&quot;

Film critic Stephen Prince suggests that the character of Kane actually represents Zinnemann, who tried to create an atmosphere of impending threat on the horizon, a fear of potential &quot;fascism&quot;, represented by the gang of killers soon arriving. Zinnemann explained the general context for many of his films: &quot;One of the crucial things today [is] trying to preserve our civilization.&quot;

Prince adds that Zinnemann, having learned that both his parents were murdered in the Holocaust, wanted Kane willing to &quot;fight rather than run&quot;, unlike everyone else in town. As a result, &quot;Zinnemann allies himself&quot; with the film&#x27;s hero. Zinnemann explains the theme of the film and its relevance to modern times:

For his screen adaptation of the play &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; (1952), Zinnemann chose Julie Harris as the film&#x27;s 12-year-old protagonist, although she was by then 26 years old. Two years earlier Harris had created the role on Broadway just as the two other leading actors, Ethel Waters and Brandon deWilde, had.

Zinnemann&#x27;s next film, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), based on the novel by James Jones, was nominated for 13 Academy Awards and would go on to win 8, including Best Picture and Best Director. Zinnemann fought hard with producer Harry Cohn to cast Montgomery Clift as the character of Prewitt, although Frank Sinatra, who was at the lowest point of his popularity, cast himself in the role of &quot;Maggio&quot; against Zinnemann&#x27;s wishes. Sinatra would later win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; also featured Deborah Kerr, best known for prim and proper roles, as a philandering Army wife. Donna Reed played the role of Alma &quot;Lorene&quot; Burke, a prostitute and mistress of Montgomery Clift&#x27;s character which earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for 1953.
In &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), Zinnemann&#x27;s version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, the wide screen format Todd-AO made its debut, as did the film&#x27;s young star, Shirley Jones. It was also an expression of Zinnemann&#x27;s continued faith and optimism about America, with its energy and exuberance.

His next film was &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; (1957), starring Don Murray, Eva Marie Saint and Anthony Franciosa, and was based on the play by Michael V. Gazzo. It is a drama story about a young married man with a secret morphine addiction who tries to quit and suffers through painful withdrawal symptoms. The film was a risk for Zinnemann, since movie depictions of drug addiction and withdrawal were rare in the 1950s.

Zinnemann rounded out the 1950s with &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959), casting Audrey Hepburn in the role of Sister Luke, a nun who eventually gives up the religious life to join the Belgian resistance in the Second World War. The film was based on the life of Marie Louise Habets. Hepburn, who gave up the chance to play Anne Frank in order to work on &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot;, considered the film to be her best and most personal work. Zinnemann&#x27;s style of cutting from close-up to close-up was heavily influenced by Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; (1928), his favorite film. He was grateful that Hepburn was easy to work with:
===1960s===
&quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960), starring Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr as an Australian outback husband and wife, led to more Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actress (Kerr) and Best Supporting Actress (Glynis Johns), but won none. &quot;Behold A Pale Horse&quot; (1964) was a post-Spanish Civil War epic based on the book &quot;Killing a Mouse on Sunday&quot; by Emeric Pressburger and starred Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif, but was both a critical and commercial flop; Zinnemann would later admit that the film &quot;didn&#x27;t really come together.&quot;

In 1965 he was a member of the jury at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival.

Zinnemann&#x27;s fortunes changed once again with &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966), scripted by Robert Bolt from his own play and starring Paul Scofield as Sir Thomas More, portraying him as a man driven by conscience to his ultimate fate. The film went on to win six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Scofield) and Best Director, Zinnemann&#x27;s second such Oscar to date. The film was also entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival.

After this, Zinnemann was all set to direct an adaptation of &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot; for MGM. However, the project was shut down in 1969, and the studio attempted to hold Zinnemann responsible for at least $1 million of the $3.5 million that had already been spent on pre-production. In protest, Zinnemann filed a lawsuit against the studio, and it would be four years before he would make his next film.

===1970s===
By the early 1970s, Zinnemann had been out of work since the cancellation of &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot;; he believed it had &quot;marked the end of an era in picture making and the dawn of a new one, when lawyers and accountants began to replace showmen as head of the studios and when a handshake was a handshake no longer.&quot; However, Universal then offered him the chance to direct &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), based on the best-selling suspense novel by Frederick Forsyth. The film starred Edward Fox as an English assassin hired to kill French president Charles de Gaulle, and Michael Lonsdale as the French detective charged with stopping him. Zinnemann was intrigued by the opportunity to direct a film in which the audience would already be able to guess the ending (the Jackal failing his mission), and was pleased when it ultimately became a hit with the public.

&quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; was followed four years later by &quot;Julia&quot; (1977), based on a story in the book &quot;&quot; by Lillian Hellman. The film starred Jane Fonda as a young Hellman and Vanessa Redgrave as her best friend Julia, an American heiress who forsakes the safety and comfort of both her homeland and great wealth to devote her life with fatal consequences to the Austrian Resistance to Nazism. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won three, for Best Screenplay (Alvin Sargent), Best Supporting Actor (Jason Robards), and Best Supporting Actress (Vanessa Redgrave); Zinnemann thought that Fonda&#x27;s acting was extraordinary enough to merit consideration for an award as well.

===1980s===
Zinnemann&#x27;s final film was &quot;Five Days One Summer&quot; (1982), filmed in Switzerland and based on the short story &quot;Maiden, Maiden&quot; by Kay Boyle. It starred Sean Connery and Betsy Brantley as a &quot;couple&quot; vacationing in the Alps in the 1930s, and a young Lambert Wilson as a mountain-climbing guide who grows heavily suspicious of their relationship. The film was both a critical and commercial flop, although Zinnemann would be told by various critics in later years that they considered it an underrated achievement. Zinnemann blamed the film&#x27;s critical and commercial failure for his retirement from filmmaking: &quot;I&#x27;m not saying it was a good picture. But there was a degree of viciousness in the reviews. The pleasure some people took in tearing down the film really hurt.&quot;

==Final years and death==
Zinnemann is often regarded as striking a blow against ageism in Hollywood. The apocryphal story goes that in the 1980s, during a meeting with a young Hollywood executive, Zinnemann was surprised to find the executive didn&#x27;t know who he was, despite having won four Academy Awards, and directing many of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest films. When the young executive asked Zinnemann to list what he had done in his career, Zinnemann reportedly answered, &quot;Sure. You first.&quot; In Hollywood, the story is known as &quot;You First,&quot; and is often alluded to when veteran creators find that upstarts are unfamiliar with their work.

Zinnemann insisted, &quot;I&#x27;ve been trying to disown that story for years. It seems to me Billy Wilder told it to me about himself.&quot;

Zinnemann died of a heart attack in London, England on March 14, 1997. He was 89 years old. Zinneman&#x27;s remains were cremated at Kensal Green Cemetery and the cremated remains were collected from the cemetery. His wife, Renee Bartlett died on December 18, 1997.

==Directing style==
Zinnemann&#x27;s training in documentary filmmaking and his personal background contributed to his style as a &quot;social realist.&quot; With his early films between 1937 and 1942 he began using that technique, and with &quot;High Noon&quot; in 1952, possibly his finest film, he created the tense atmosphere by coordinating screen time with real time.

Because he started his film career as a cameraman, his movies are strongly oriented toward the visual aspects. He also said that regardless of the size of an actor&#x27;s part, he spends much time discussing the roles with each actor separately and in depth. &quot;In this way we make sure long before the filming starts that we are on the same wavelength,&quot; he says.

Zinnemann&#x27;s films are mostly dramas about lone and principled individuals tested by tragic events, including &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953); &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959); &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; (1966); and &quot;Julia&quot; (1977). Regarded as a consummate craftsman, Zinnemann traditionally endowed his work with meticulous attention to detail to create realism, and had an intuitive gift for casting and a preoccupation with the moral dilemmas of his characters. His philosophy about directing influenced director Alan Parker:

In &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, for example, he effectively added actual newsreel footage of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which enhanced and dramatized the story. Similarly, in &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;, he used a documentary style to present real life drug addiction in New York City. Zinnemann again incorporated newsreel footage in &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;, about the Spanish Civil War. &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, a political thriller about an attempt to assassinate Charles de Gaulle, was shot on location in newsreel style, while &quot;Julia&quot; placed the characters in authentic settings, as in a suspenseful train journey from Paris to Moscow during World War II. According to one historian, Zinnemann&#x27;s style &quot;demonstrates the director&#x27;s sense of psychological realism and his apparent determination to make worthwhile pictures that are nevertheless highly entertaining.&quot;

<text>A peck is an imperial and United States customary unit of dry volume, equivalent to 8 dry quarts or 16 dry pints. An imperial peck is equivalent to 9.09218 liters and a US customary peck is equivalent to 8.80976754172 liters. Four pecks make a bushel. Although the peck is no longer widely used, some produce, such as apples, are still often sold by the peck in the U.S. (although it is obsolete in the UK, found only in the old nursery rhyme &quot;Peter Piper&quot; and in the Bible – e.g., Matthew 5:15 in some older translations).

==Scotland before 1824==

In Scotland, the peck was used as a dry measure until the introduction of imperial units as a result of the Weights and Measures Act 1824. The peck was equal to about 9 litres (1.98 Imp gal) (in the case of certain crops, such as wheat, peas, beans and meal) and about 13 litres (2.86 Imp gal) (in the case of barley, oats and malt). A firlot was equal to 4 pecks.

<doc id="97803" wikidata="Q55497" url="?curid=97803" title="Jamie Lynn Spears">
<text>Jamie Lynn Marie Spears (born April 4, 1991) is an American actress and singer. Spears began her career as a child actress on &quot;All That&quot; and had her breakthrough role when she played Zoey Brooks on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom &quot;Zoey 101&quot; (2005–2008); she later reprised this role in the sequel film &quot;Zoey 102&quot; (2023). She plays Noreen Fitzgibbons on the Netflix romantic drama series &quot;Sweet Magnolias&quot; (2020–present). She is the recipient of several accolades, including a Gracie Award, two Kids Choice Awards and two Young Artist Awards. She is the younger sister of singer Britney Spears.

Beginning in December 2007, Spears was subject to significant media attention and controversy after announcing her pregnancy at age 16. A misconception emerged that this canceled &quot;Zoey 101&quot;; however, the final season wrapped filming in September 2007 and premiered the following year. After giving birth in 2008, Spears stopped acting for five years.

Spears returned from her hiatus in 2013 and began her music career. She released her debut single &quot;How Could I Want More&quot; from her debut EP in country music, &quot;The Journey&quot; (2014). Spears also co-wrote Jana Kramer&#x27;s platinum certified 2015 single, &quot;I Got the Boy&quot;.

In 2023, due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, Spears appeared on reality television shows, such as &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, &quot;Special Forces: World&#x27;s Toughest Test&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.&quot;

== Early life ==
Spears was born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, to Jamie and Lynne Spears. Her older siblings are Bryan and Britney. Her parents divorced in 2002, but were in an on-and-off relationship after the divorce. She has described her home life as unstable, but remembers &quot;feeling very loved&quot;. She attended Parklane Academy in McComb, where she was a cheerleader, and point guard of the basketball team. She was enrolled in dance and voice lessons, and participated in school plays and church performances. As a child, Spears and her family also spent time traveling and touring with Britney.

Spears studied with tutors while filming &quot;Zoey 101&quot; in Los Angeles. She finished her education via online correspondence and received her GED in February 2008 through Tangipahoa Parish School System Adult Education Center.

== Career ==

=== 2002–2008: Career beginnings and success with &quot;All That&quot; and &quot;Zoey 101&quot; ===
In February 2002, at age 10, Spears made her acting debut in the Paramount Pictures drama film &quot;Crossroads&quot; which starred her sister, who portrayed the central character Lucy Wagner. Spears made a cameo, playing the younger version of Britney&#x27;s character. In April 2002, Spears walked the runway as a model for Kids R Us fashion show in New York City. Following &quot;Crossroads&quot;, Nickelodeon cast Spears as a regular performer in the sketch comedy series &quot;All That&quot; for the 2002 season; she appeared on the show through 2004. Spears portrayed various roles through the two seasons she appeared. Along with the cast of &quot;All That&quot;, Spears also made appearances on &quot;Snick On-Air Dare&quot;, Nickelodeon&#x27;s version of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. Deciding to pursue other roles on the network, Spears departed from the main cast on the tenth and final season of &quot;All That&quot;, and only appeared as a guest. At age 13, Spears was named as one of the celebrities on &quot;Teen People&quot;&#x27;s Young Hollywood/Hot List.

In August 2004, Spears signed a development deal with Nickelodeon in which she would star as the protagonist in her own scripted television series that would air on the network. The series went on to be titled &quot;Zoey 101&quot; and Spears portrayed the role of Zoey Brooks. The series centered on Zoey and her friends who attend a fictional boarding school, Pacific Coast Academy (PCA). Spears recorded the series theme song, titled &quot;Follow Me&quot;, which was written by her sister Britney Spears. Filmed at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, the series premiered on January 9, 2005, and was the network&#x27;s highest-rated series premiere in over eight years. Spears won a Young Artist Award and a Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards for her performance. In September 2007, she won &quot;The High School Sweetheart&quot; award at &quot;Us Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Hot Hollywood event.

&quot;Zoey 101&quot; was positively received by critics and viewers. It was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Programming, and the show&#x27;s season 3 finale episode was the second most-watched show across all cable channels that week. The series ran for four seasons, with its series finale &quot;PCA Confidential&quot; airing on May 2, 2008. Nickelodeon issued a statement shortly after the announcement of Spears being pregnant at the age of 16, stating that the network respected Spears&#x27;s decision to take responsibility and noting that its primary concern was for her well-being. Spears&#x27; co-star Seann Flynn praised her as hard-working and talented, telling &quot;Nylon&quot;: &quot;One of the things that always stood out to me regarding her professionalism was how well she knew her lines. I don’t think she ever messed one up. She always brought her best work to the table.&quot;

In December 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Spears had signed on to guest-appear in the ABC comedy sitcom series &quot;Miss Guided&quot;, in which she played the role of the promiscuous high-school student Mandy Fener in the episode &quot;Hot Sub&quot; which aired on March 20, 2008. That same year, Spears voiced Goldilocks in the direct-to-DVD animation film &quot;Unstable Fables: Goldilocks &amp; 3 Bears Show&quot;.

=== 2011–2017: Country music debut ===

In 2011, Spears moved to Nashville and began working on a country music album with local music producers. On November 7, 2011, Spears held a small concert at The Rutledge in Nashville. On November 25, 2013, Spears released her first single &quot;How Could I Want More&quot;. The song debuted at number 29 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Country Songs, and at number 8 on the Country Digital Songs chart, for the week ending December 7, 2013. Kevin Rutherford of &quot;Billboard&quot; described Spears&#x27; performance as &quot;sweet and innocent&quot; yet powerful, and suggested the song would fit right in at country radio. The song was named &quot;Taste of Country&quot;&#x27;s Top Critic&#x27;s Pick.

Spears was featured on her older sister Britney Spears&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Britney Jean&quot; on the song &quot;Chillin&#x27; with You&quot;. On May 27, 2014, Spears released her debut EP &quot;The Journey&quot;. The EP peaked at number 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Heatseekers Albums and at number 24 on Top Country Albums. That year, Spears made numerous appearances on country radio talk shows, made performances at fairs and festivals, and was an opening act for Alan Jackson. Spears co-wrote the Jana Kramer song &quot;I Got the Boy&quot; which was released as the second single from &quot;Thirty One&quot; in 2015.

In 2016, Spears released the documentary &quot;Jamie Lynn Spears: When the Lights Go Out&quot;, reflecting on the controversy of her pregnancy, showcasing her country music career after &quot;realizing [her] true calling was music&quot; as well as her personal life as a wife and mother. On March 15, 2016, Spears performed at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. On June 24, 2016, Spears released her second single &quot;Sleepover&quot;. Spears was a presenter and a performer at Radio Disney Music Awards in April 2017.

=== 2018–2023: Return to acting, &quot;Zoey 102&quot;, memoir and reality television===
In an episode that aired on July 13, 2018, Spears returned to Nickelodeon for the first time in over ten years as a contestant on the revived game show &quot;Double Dare&quot; with her daughter Maddie, competing against fellow &quot;All That&quot; alumnus Josh Server and his niece. She and Maddie won over $15,000 to donate to the New Orleans hospital that treated Maddie in 2017.

In July 2019, Netflix announced that Spears was cast as Noreen Fitzgibbons in the romance drama series &quot;Sweet Magnolias&quot;, based on the novel series by Sherryl Woods. In July 2020, the cast of &quot;Zoey 101&quot; reunited in an episode of the eleventh season of &quot;All That.&quot; Spears played herself and her old &quot;All That&quot; character Thelma Stump. That year, Spears and Chantel Jeffries recorded a new version of the &quot;Zoey 101&quot; theme song &quot;Follow Me&quot;. The music video for the song featured appearances by numerous celebrities and Spears&#x27; elder daughter Maddie. On October 29, 2020, Spears performed &quot;Follow Me&quot; on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

In July 2021, Worthy Publishing, an imprint of Hachette Book Group announced Spears&#x27;s plans to release a memoir, which had been in development over the previous twelve months. Her memoir titled &quot;Things I Should Have Said: Family, Fame, and Figuring it Out&quot; was released on January 18, 2022. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; recommended the book but highlighted that Jamie Lynn ostensibly used her sister Britney Spears&#x27; highly publicized struggles and conservatorship to promote her new book. The book was not a financial success. On January 4, 2023, she began competing on Fox&#x27;s survival television series &quot;Special Forces: World&#x27;s Toughest Test&quot;, where contestants participate in special forces training challenges at a camp removed from society. She left the series during the competition&#x27;s third episode, with Spears saying that she missed her children.

On July 27, 2023, the sequel film &quot;Zoey 102&quot; was released on Paramount+, with Spears reprising her role from &quot;Zoey 101&quot; alongside many of the original cast members. Production took place in January 2023 in North Carolina, with Spears attached as executive producer. &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;highly anticipated sequel&quot;, while &quot;Ready Steady Cut&quot; praised the film as a &quot;a nostalgic and amusing watch, enjoyable for original fans and the series newcomers.&quot; One day after its release, the film was the third most watched on Paramount+ in the U.S. and the second most watched in Canada.

In late 2023, Spears appeared in two unscripted projects, which she noted was due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Spears competed on season 32 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars,&quot; paired with Alan Bersten; the season premiered on September 26, 2023. She donated her weekly earnings to SAG-AFTRA and the WGA. Spears was eliminated in the second week of the competition. On December 5, 2023, she returned for a group dance performance in the season finale along with other eliminated contestants. Spears appeared as a contestant on the twenty-third season of British survival reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, which premiered on November 19, 2023. Spears left the show after 11 days on November 29, 2023 for medical reasons, placing 11th in the series. She was the second contestant to depart on medical grounds that season, as Grace Dent left days earlier.
=== 2024–present: Upcoming projects ===
Spears began filming the fourth season of &quot;Sweet Magnolias&quot; in February 2024, and the filming for the season ended in the following June. On September 21, 2024, she competed in a charity softball game at University of Louisiana at Monroe to help the school&#x27;s softball team raise funds.

== Public image ==
In the early years of her career, Spears had a generally wholesome image as a teen star. Her fame increased dramatically in the wake of her pregnancy announcement in December 2007, and during the following months, she became a frequent target of the paparazzi. In subsequent years, Spears was rarely seen in the public eye and focused on family, saying: &quot;I used to be insecure at times, because I was always the youngest mom in the room. I quickly learned that being a good and competent mother has nothing to do with age.&quot;

Spears has been featured in several fashion blogs and magazines such as &quot;Nylon,&quot; &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, &quot;CosmoGirl&quot;, &quot;Teen People&quot;, &quot;Teen&quot;, &quot;Girls&#x27; Life, Mizz&quot; and &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;. Spears has appeared in commercials and print ads throughout her career. She appeared in television commercials for Hasbro&#x27;s eKara karaoke headset, Pepsi and Clorox bleach. In 2018, she appeared in an advertising campaign and social media ads for Kraft Foods with daughter Maddie.

Spears endorses beauty and wellness products on Instagram. She has partnered with FabFitFun subscription box, Smart Food popcorn and International Loops marketing agency.

== Personal life ==
Spears attended First Baptist Church in Kentwood, Louisiana, but she is Catholic since her conversion in early 2018, as are her daughters and her mother Lynne.

In 2013, Spears was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. She underwent therapy and briefly used medication as well. &quot;The anxiety was to the point where I couldn&#x27;t function,&quot; she commented. &quot;I&#x27;m very conscious not to lie to myself anymore because I think that my biggest issue my whole life was pretending to be perfect.&quot;

=== Teenage pregnancy ===
On December 20, 2007, in an interview with &quot;OK!&quot; magazine, Spears announced that she was pregnant by her then boyfriend, Casey Aldridge. She was 16 years old at the time. Aldridge, whom she had been dating for two years, was 18. Spears confirmed her engagement to Aldridge in March 2008. In May 2008, the couple moved to Liberty, Mississippi, and purchased a house, with Spears stating they would raise their child there. She gave birth to their daughter Maddie Briann Aldridge on June 19, 2008, in McComb, Mississippi.
Spears and Aldridge ended their engagement in March 2009, and Spears moved out in December 2009. The couple reconciled in August 2010, but ended their relationship a second time in November 2010.

The announcement of Spears&#x27; pregnancy generated controversy, with criticism centering on the story purportedly glamorizing teenage pregnancy. Some teens were disappointed with the contrast between Spears&#x27; on-screen personality as a &quot;good&quot; girl and her real-life teen pregnancy. On June 4, 2008, while in Amite County, Mississippi, the Spears family filed a complaint against Edwin Merrino, a paparazzo who, they believed, was stalking the couple. Merrino denied the allegation. He was released later in the day after posting bond. After her daughter&#x27;s birth, Spears disappeared from the public eye for five years, focusing on raising her child. In an interview with &quot;Nylon&quot;, Spears said: &quot;So, I got me a little house. I put a big gate up around it, and I was like, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to stay here, raise my baby, and figure this out because this is real life. I&#x27;ve put myself in this situation, I&#x27;m not condoning it or saying it&#x27;s right, but these are the cards that I have to play.&#x27; And I tried to do the best that I could.&quot;

=== Marriage and family ===
She subsequently began a relationship with Jamie Watson, a businessman who owns the communications service Advanced Media Partners. After two years of on-and-off dating, they announced their engagement in March 2013. On March 14, 2014, she married Watson in New Orleans. On April 11, 2018, Spears gave birth to her second daughter.

====ATV incident====

On February 5, 2017, Spears&#x27; eight-year-old daughter Maddie almost drowned in a Polaris ATV accident, after accidentally driving into the pond on her stepfather and mother&#x27;s Louisiana property, with the ATV flipping over upon impact. She was later airlifted to Children&#x27;s Hospital of New Orleans, where she remained unconscious in a coma for two days. She woke up and was released from care on February 10. Police reported the incident as occurring before 3:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon, and the sheriff explained that she was steering &quot;100 yards from her parents&quot; when she took &quot;a hard right to avoid running over a nearby drainage ditch&quot;. The police report stated, &quot;The child was trapped and secured by the seatbelt and the ATV&#x27;s safety netting. Within two minutes, Acadian Ambulance Services arrived and assisted in freeing the child from the cold waters.&quot;

In 2020, Spears explained the situation further. She elaborated that she and her husband Jamie Watson &quot;[...] dove in and [...] were able to rescue her,&quot; then the first responder took her away. The firefighter was able to get a pulse, but her case looked &quot;grim at the time&quot;, leading to her being airlifted to the hospital.

=== Feud with Britney Spears ===
In 2021, Jamie Lynn and her sister Britney were involved in a highly publicized feud via social media. Britney publicly accused Jamie Lynn of actively and knowingly being involved in her conservatorship, while not making any efforts to help her terminate it. Jamie Lynn denied the allegations and maintained that she was unaware of the details of the conservatorship. Britney threatened legal action against Jamie Lynn after the latter spoke extensively about Britney in both her book and the following promotional tour.

<doc id="97805" wikidata="Q207718" url="?curid=97805" title="Isaac Barrow">
<text>Isaac Barrow (October 1630 – 4 May 1677) was an English Christian theologian and mathematician who is generally given credit for his early role in the development of infinitesimal calculus; in particular, for proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus. His work centered on the properties of the tangent; Barrow was the first to calculate the tangents of the kappa curve. He is also notable for being the inaugural holder of the prestigious Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics, a post later held by his student, Isaac Newton.

== Life ==
=== Early life and education ===

Barrow was born in London. He was the son of Thomas Barrow, a linen draper by trade. In 1624, Thomas married Ann, daughter of William Buggin of North Cray, Kent and their son Isaac was born in 1630. It appears that Barrow was the only child of this union—certainly the only child to survive infancy. Ann died around 1634, and the widowed father sent the lad to his grandfather, Isaac, the Cambridgeshire J.P., who resided at Spinney Abbey. Within two years, however, Thomas remarried; the new wife was Katherine Oxinden, sister of Henry Oxinden of Maydekin, Kent. From this marriage, he had at least one daughter, Elizabeth (born 1641), and a son, Thomas, who apprenticed to Edward Miller, skinner, and won his release in 1647, emigrating to Barbados in 1680.

=== Early career ===
Isaac went to school first at Charterhouse (where he was so turbulent and pugnacious that his father was heard to pray that if it pleased God to take any of his children he could best spare Isaac), and subsequently to Felsted School, where he settled and learned under the brilliant puritan Headmaster Martin Holbeach who ten years previously had educated John Wallis. Having learnt Greek, Hebrew, Latin and logic at Felsted, in preparation for university studies, he continued his education at Trinity College, Cambridge; he enrolled there because of an offer of support from an unspecified member of the Walpole family, &quot;an offer that was perhaps prompted by the Walpoles&#x27; sympathy for Barrow&#x27;s adherence to the Royalist cause.&quot; His uncle and namesake Isaac Barrow, afterwards Bishop of St Asaph, was a Fellow of Peterhouse. He took to hard study, distinguishing himself in classics and mathematics; after taking his degree in 1648, he was elected to a fellowship in 1649. Barrow received an MA from Cambridge in 1652 as a student of James Duport; he then resided for a few years in college, and became candidate for the Greek Professorship at Cambridge, but in 1655 having refused to sign the Engagement to uphold the Commonwealth, he obtained travel grants to go abroad.

==== Travel ====
He spent the next four years traveling across France, Italy, and Turkey. In Turkey he lived in Izmir and studied in Istanbul (then called Smyrna and Constantinople), and after many adventures returned to England in 1659. He was known for his courageousness. Particularly noted is the occasion of his having saved the ship he was upon, by the merits of his own prowess, from capture by pirates. He is described as &quot;low in stature, lean, and of a pale complexion,&quot; slovenly in his dress, and having a committed and long-standing habit of tobacco use (an &quot; smoker&quot;). In respect to his courtly activities his aptitude to wit earned him favour with Charles II, and the respect of his fellow courtiers. In his writings one might find accordingly, a sustained and somewhat stately eloquence. He was an altogether impressive personage of the time, having lived a blameless life in which he exercised his conduct with due care and conscientiousness.

=== Later career ===
==== Work ====
On the Restoration in 1660, he was ordained and appointed to the Regius Professorship of Greek at the University of Cambridge. In 1662, he was made professor of geometry at Gresham College, and in 1663 was selected as the first occupier of the Lucasian chair at Cambridge. During his tenure of this chair he published two mathematical works of great learning and elegance, the first on geometry and the second on optics. In 1669 he resigned his professorship in favour of Isaac Newton. About this time, Barrow composed his &quot;Expositions of the Creed, The Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Decalogue, and Sacraments&quot;. For the remainder of his life he devoted himself to the study of divinity. He was made a Doctor of Divinity by Royal mandate in 1670, and two years later Master of Trinity College (1672), where he founded the library, and held the post until his death.
His earliest work was a complete edition of the &quot;Elements&quot; of Euclid, which he issued in Latin in 1655, and in English in 1660; in 1657 he published an edition of the &quot;Data&quot;. His lectures, delivered in 1664, 1665, and 1666, were published in 1683 under the title &quot;Lectiones Mathematicae&quot;; these are mostly on the metaphysical basis for mathematical truths. His lectures for 1667 were published in the same year, and suggest the analysis by which Archimedes was led to his chief results. In 1669 he issued his &quot;Lectiones Opticae et Geometricae&quot;. It is said in the preface that Newton revised and corrected these lectures, adding matter of his own, but it seems probable from Newton&#x27;s remarks in the fluxional controversy that the additions were confined to the parts which dealt with optics. This, which is his most important work in mathematics, was republished with a few minor alterations in 1674. In 1675 he published an edition with numerous comments of the first four books of the &quot;On Conic Sections&quot; of Apollonius of Perga, and of the extant works of Archimedes and Theodosius of Bithynia.

In the optical lectures many problems connected with the reflection and refraction of light are treated with ingenuity. The geometrical focus of a point seen by reflection or refraction is defined; and it is explained that the image of an object is the locus of the geometrical foci of every point on it. Barrow also worked out a few of the easier properties of thin lenses, and considerably simplified the Cartesian explanation of the rainbow.

Barrow was the first to find the integral of the secant function in closed form, thereby proving a conjecture that was well-known at the time.

==== Death and legacy ====
Barrow died unmarried in London at the early age of 46, and was buried at Westminster Abbey. John Aubrey, in the Brief Lives, attributes his death to an opium addiction acquired during his residence in Turkey.

Besides the works above mentioned, he wrote other important treatises on mathematics, but in literature his place is chiefly supported by his sermons, which are masterpieces of argumentative eloquence, while his &quot;Treatise on the Pope&#x27;s Supremacy&quot; is regarded as one of the most perfect specimens of controversy in existence. Barrow&#x27;s character as a man was in all respects worthy of his great talents, though he had a strong vein of eccentricity.

==Calculating tangents==
The geometrical lectures contain some new ways of determining the areas and tangents of curves. The most celebrated of these is the method given for the determination of tangents to curves, and this is sufficiently important to require a detailed notice, because it illustrates the way in which Barrow, Hudde and Sluze were working on the lines suggested by Fermat towards the methods of the differential calculus.
Fermat had observed that the tangent at a point &quot;P&quot; on a curve was determined if one other point besides &quot;P&quot; on it were known; hence, if the length of the subtangent &quot;MT&quot; could be found (thus determining the point &quot;T&quot;), then the line &quot;TP&quot; would be the required tangent. Now Barrow remarked that if the abscissa and ordinate at a point &quot;Q&quot; adjacent to &quot;P&quot; were drawn, he got a small triangle &quot;PQR&quot; (which he called the
differential triangle, because its sides &quot;QR&quot; and &quot;RP&quot; were the differences of the abscissae and ordinates of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;), so that
K
:&quot;TM&quot; : &quot;MP&quot; = &quot;QR&quot; : &quot;RP&quot;.

To find &quot;QR&quot; : &quot;RP&quot; he supposed that &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;
were the co-ordinates of &quot;P&quot;, and &quot;x&quot; − &quot;e&quot;, &quot;y&quot;
− &quot;a&quot; those of &quot;Q&quot; (Barrow actually used &quot;p&quot; for &quot;x&quot; and &quot;m&quot; for &quot;y&quot;, but this article uses the standard modern notation). Substituting the co-ordinates of &quot;Q&quot; in the equation of the curve, and neglecting the squares and higher powers of &quot;e&quot; and &quot;a&quot; as compared with their first powers, he obtained &quot;e&quot; : &quot;a&quot;. The ratio &quot;a&quot;/&quot;e&quot; was subsequently (in accordance with a suggestion made by Sluze) termed the angular coefficient of the tangent at the point.

Barrow applied this method to the curves
#&quot;x&quot;2 (&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2) = &quot;r&quot;2&quot;y&quot;2, the kappa curve;
#&quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;y&quot;3 = &quot;r&quot;3;
#&quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;y&quot;3 = &quot;rxy&quot;, called &quot;la galande&quot;;
#&quot;y&quot; = (&quot;r&quot; − &quot;x&quot;) tan π&quot;x&quot;/2&quot;r&quot;, the quadratrix; and
#&quot;y&quot; = &quot;r&quot; tan π&quot;x&quot;/2&quot;r&quot;.

It will be sufficient here to take as an illustration the simpler case of the parabola &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;px&quot;.
Using the notation given above, we have for the point &quot;P&quot;, &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;px&quot;; and for the point &quot;Q&quot;:
:(&quot;y&quot; − &quot;a&quot;)2 = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot; − &quot;e&quot;).

Subtracting we get
:2&quot;ay&quot; − &quot;a&quot;2 = &quot;pe&quot;.
But, if &quot;a&quot; be an infinitesimal quantity,
&quot;a&quot;2 must be infinitely smaller and therefore may be neglected
when compared with the quantities 2&quot;ay&quot; and &quot;pe&quot;. Hence
:2&quot;ay&quot; = &quot;pe&quot;, that is, &quot;e&quot; : &quot;a&quot; = 2&quot;y&quot; : &quot;p&quot;.
Therefore,
:&quot;TM&quot; : &quot;y&quot; = &quot;e&quot; : &quot;a&quot; = 2&quot;y&quot; : &quot;p&quot;.
Hence
:TM = 2&quot;y&quot;2/&quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;x&quot;.

This is exactly the procedure of the differential calculus, except that there we
have a rule by which we can get the ratio &quot;a&quot;/&quot;e&quot; or &quot;dy&quot;/&quot;dx&quot; directly without the labour of going through a calculation similar to the above for every separate case.

<text>Jules Richard (12 August 1862 – 14 October 1956) was a French mathematician who worked mainly in geometry but his name is most commonly associated with Richard&#x27;s paradox.

== Life and works==
Richard was born in Blet, in the Cher &quot;département&quot;.

He taught at the lycées of Tours, Dijon and Châteauroux. He obtained his doctorate, at age of 39, from the Faculté des Sciences in Paris. His thesis of 126 pages concerns Fresnel&#x27;s wave-surface. Richard worked mainly on the foundations of mathematics and geometry, relating to works by Hilbert, von Staudt and Méray.

In a more philosophical treatise about the nature of axioms of geometry Richard discusses and rejects the following basic principles:
# Geometry is founded on arbitrarily chosen axioms - there are infinitely many equally true geometries. 
# Experience provides the axioms of geometry, the basis is experimental, the development deductive. 
# The axioms of geometry are definitions (in contrast to (1)).
# Axioms are neither experimental nor arbitrary, they force themselves on us since without them experience is not possible.

The latter approach was essentially that proposed by Kant. Richard arrived at the result that the notion of identity of two objects and the invariability of an object are too vague and need to be specified more precisely. This should be done by axioms.

Further according to Richard, it is the aim of science to explain the material universe. And although non-Euclidean geometry had not found any applications (Albert Einstein finished his general theory of relativity only in 1915), Richard already stated clairvoyantly:

Richard corresponded with Giuseppe Peano and Henri Poincaré. He became known to more than a small group of specialists by formulating his paradox which was extensively use by Poincaré to attack set theory whereupon the advocates of set theory had to refute these attacks.

He died in 1956 in Châteauroux, in the Indre &quot;département&quot;, at the age of 94.

== Richard&#x27;s paradox ==

The paradox was first stated in 1905 in a letter to Louis Olivier, director of the &quot;Revue générale des sciences pures et appliquées&quot;. It was published in 1905 in the article &quot;Les Principes des mathématiques et le problème des ensembles&quot;. The Principia Mathematica by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell quote it together with six other paradoxes concerning the problem of self-reference. In one of the most important compendia of mathematical logic, compiled by Jean van Heijenoort, Richard&#x27;s article is translated into English. The paradox can be interpreted as an application of Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument. It inspired Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing to their famous works. Kurt Gödel considered his incompleteness theorem as analogous to Richard&#x27;s paradox which, in the original version runs as follows:

Let &quot;E&quot; be the set of real numbers that can be defined by a finite number of words. This set is denumerable. Let &quot;p&quot; be the &quot;n&quot;th decimal of the &quot;n&quot;th number of the set &quot;E&quot;; we form a number &quot;N&quot; having zero for the integral part and &quot;p&quot; + 1 for the &quot;n&quot;th decimal, if &quot;p&quot; is not equal either to 8 or 9, and unity in the contrary case. This number &quot;N&quot; does not belong to the set &quot;E&quot; because it differs from any number of this set, namely from the &quot;n&quot;th number by the &quot;n&quot;th digit. But &quot;N&quot; has been defined by a finite number of words. It should therefore belong to the set &quot;E&quot;. That is a contradiction.

Richard never presented his paradox in another form, but meanwhile there exist several different versions, some of which being only very loosely connected to the original. For the sake of completeness they may be stated here.

== Other versions of Richard&#x27;s paradox ==

(A) The version given in Principia Mathematica by Whitehead and Russell is similar to Richard&#x27;s original version, alas not quite as exact. Here only the digit 9 is replaced by the digit 0, such that identities like 1.000... = 0.999... can spoil the result.

(B) Berry&#x27;s Paradox, first mentioned in the Principia Mathematica as fifth of seven paradoxes, is credited to Mr. G. G. Berry of the Bodleian Library. It uses &quot;the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables&quot;; in fact, in English it denotes 111,777. But &quot;the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables&quot; is itself a name consisting of eighteen syllables; hence the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables can be named in eighteen syllables, which is a contradiction

(C) Berry&#x27;s Paradox with letters instead of syllables is often related to the set of all natural numbers which can be defined by less than 100 (or any other large number) letters. As the natural numbers are a well-ordered set there must be &quot;the least number which cannot be defined by less than 100 letters&quot;. But this number was just defined by 65 letters including spaces.

(D) König&#x27;s Paradox was also published in 1905 by Julius König. All real numbers which can be defined by a finite number of words form a subset of the real numbers. If the real numbers can be well-ordered, then there must be a first real number (according to this order) which cannot be defined by a finite number of words. But &quot;the first real number which cannot be defined by a finite number of words&quot; has just been defined by a finite number of words.

(E) The smallest natural number without interesting properties acquires an interesting property by this very lack of any interesting properties.

(F) A loan of the Paradox of Grelling and Nelson. The number of all finite definitions is countable. In lexical order we obtain a sequence of definitions &quot;D&quot;1, &quot;D&quot;2, &quot;D&quot;3, ... Now, it may happen that a definition defines its own number. This would be the case if &quot;D&quot;1 read &quot;the smallest natural number&quot;. It may happen, that a definition does not describe its own number. This would be the case if &quot;D&quot;2 read &quot;the smallest natural number&quot;. Also the sentence &quot;this definition does not describe its number&quot; is a finite definition. Let it be &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Is &quot;n&quot; described by &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;. If yes, then no, and if no, then yes. The dilemma is irresolvable. (This version is described in more detail in another article, Richard&#x27;s paradox.)

== Reactions to Richard&#x27;s paradox ==

Georg Cantor wrote in a letter to David Hilbert:
*&quot;Infinite definitions&quot; (i.e., definitions which cannot be done in finite time) are absurdities. If Königs statement was &quot;correct&quot;, according to which all &quot;finitely definable&quot; real numbers form a collection of cardinal number formula_1, this would imply the countability of the whole continuum; but this is obviously wrong. The question is now what error the alleged proof of his wrong theorem is based upon. The error (which also appears in the note of a Mr. Richard in the last issue of the Acta mathematic, which Mr. Poincaré emphasizes in the last issue of the Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale) is, in my opinion, the following: It is assumed that the system {&quot;B&quot;} of notions &quot;B&quot;, which have to be used for the definition of individual numbers, is at most countably infinite. This assumption &quot;must be in error&quot; because otherwise we would have the wrong theorem: &quot;the continuum of numbers has cardinality formula_1&quot;.

Here Cantor is in error. Today we know that there are uncountably many real numbers without the possibility of a finite definition.

Ernst Zermelo comments Richard&#x27;s argument:
* The notion &quot;finitely definable&quot; is not an absolute one but a relative one being always related to the &quot;language&quot; chosen. The conclusion according to which all finitely definable objects are countable is only valid in case that one and the same system of symbols is used; the question whether a single individual can be subject to a finite definition is void because to every thing an arbitrary name can be attached to.

Zermelo points to the reason why Richard&#x27;s paradox fails. His last statement, however, is impossible to satisfy. A real number with infinitely many digits, which are not determined by some &quot;rule&quot;, has an infinitely large contents of information. Such a number could only be identified by a short name if there were only one or few of them existing. If there exist uncountably many, as is the case, an identification is impossible.

<text>In logic, Richard&#x27;s paradox is a semantical antinomy of set theory and natural language first described by the French mathematician Jules Richard in 1905. The paradox is ordinarily used to motivate the importance of distinguishing carefully between mathematics and metamathematics. 

Kurt Gödel specifically cites Richard&#x27;s antinomy as a semantical analogue to his syntactical incompleteness result in the introductory section of &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I&quot;. The paradox was also a motivation for the development of predicative mathematics.

== Description ==

The original statement of the paradox, due to Richard (1905), is strongly related to Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument on the uncountability of the set of real numbers.

The paradox begins with the observation that certain expressions of natural language define real numbers unambiguously, while other expressions of natural language do not. For example, &quot;The real number the integer part of which is 17 and the &quot;n&quot;th decimal place of which is 0 if &quot;n&quot; is even and 1 if &quot;n&quot; is odd&quot; defines the real number 17.1010101... = 1693/99, whereas the phrase &quot;the capital of England&quot; does not define a real number, nor the phrase &quot;the smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters&quot; (see Berry&#x27;s paradox).

There is an infinite list of English phrases (such that each phrase is of finite length, but the list itself is of infinite length) that define real numbers unambiguously. We first arrange this list of phrases by increasing length, then order all phrases of equal length lexicographically, so that the ordering is canonical. This yields an infinite list of the corresponding real numbers: &quot;r&quot;1, &quot;r&quot;2, ... . Now define a new real number &quot;r&quot; as follows. The integer part of &quot;r&quot; is 0, the &quot;n&quot;th decimal place of &quot;r&quot; is 1 if the &quot;n&quot;th decimal place of &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot; is not 1, and the &quot;n&quot;th decimal place of &quot;r&quot; is 2 if the &quot;n&quot;th decimal place of &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot; is 1.

The preceding paragraph is an expression in English that unambiguously defines a real number &quot;r&quot;. Thus &quot;r&quot; must be one of the numbers &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot;. However, &quot;r&quot; was constructed so that it cannot equal any of the &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot; (thus, &quot;r&quot; is an undefinable number). This is the paradoxical contradiction.

== Analysis and relationship with metamathematics ==

Richard&#x27;s paradox results in an untenable contradiction, which must be analyzed to find an error.

The proposed definition of the new real number &quot;r&quot; clearly includes a finite sequence of characters, and hence it seems at first to be a definition of a real number. However, the definition refers to definability-in-English itself. If it were possible to determine which English expressions actually &quot;do&quot; define a real number, and which do not, then the paradox would go through. Thus the resolution of Richard&#x27;s paradox is that there is not any way to unambiguously determine exactly which English sentences are definitions of real numbers (see Good 1966). That is, there is not any way to describe in a finite number of words how to tell whether an arbitrary English expression is a definition of a real number. This is not surprising, as the ability to make this determination would also imply the ability to solve the halting problem and perform any other non-algorithmic calculation that can be described in English.

A similar phenomenon occurs in formalized theories that are able to refer to their own syntax, such as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). Say that a formula φ(&quot;x&quot;) &quot;defines a real number&quot; if there is exactly one real number &quot;r&quot; such that φ(&quot;r&quot;) holds. Then it is not possible to define, by ZFC, the set of all (Gödel numbers of) formulas that define real numbers. For, if it were possible to define this set, it would be possible to diagonalize over it to produce a new definition of a real number, following the outline of Richard&#x27;s paradox above. Note that the set of formulas that define real numbers may exist, as a set &quot;F&quot;; the limitation of ZFC is that there is not any formula that defines &quot;F&quot; without reference to other sets. This is related to Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem.

The example of ZFC illustrates the importance of distinguishing the metamathematics of a formal system from the statements of the formal system itself. The property D(φ) that a formula φ of ZFC defines a unique real number is not itself expressible by ZFC, but must be considered as part of the metatheory used to formalize ZFC. From this viewpoint, Richard&#x27;s paradox results from treating a construction of the metatheory (the enumeration of all statements in the original system that define real numbers) as if that construction could be performed in the original system.

== Variation: Richardian numbers ==

A variation of the paradox uses integers instead of real numbers, while preserving the self-referential character of the original. Consider a language (such as English) in which the arithmetical properties of integers are defined. For example, &quot;the first natural number&quot; defines the property of being the first natural number, one; and &quot;divisible by exactly two natural numbers&quot; defines the property of being a prime number (It is clear that some properties cannot be defined explicitly, since every deductive system must start with some axioms. But for the purposes of this argument, it is assumed that phrases such as &quot;an integer is the sum of two integers&quot; are already understood). While the list of all such possible definitions is itself infinite, it is easily seen that each individual definition is composed of a finite number of words, and therefore also a finite number of characters. Since this is true, we can order the definitions, first by length and then lexicographically.

Now, we may map each definition to the set of natural numbers, such that the definition with the smallest number of characters and alphabetical order will correspond to the number 1, the next definition in the series will correspond to 2, and so on. Since each definition is associated with a unique integer, then it is possible that occasionally the integer assigned to a definition &quot;fits&quot; that definition. If, for example, the definition &quot;not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself&quot; happened to be 43rd, then this would be true. Since 43 is itself not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, then the number of this definition has the property of the definition itself. However, this may not always be the case. If the definition: &quot;divisible by 3&quot; were assigned to the number 58, then the number of the definition does &quot;not&quot; have the property of the definition itself, since 58 is itself not divisible by 3. This latter example will be termed as having the property of being &quot;Richardian&quot;. Thus, if a number is Richardian, then the definition corresponding to that number is a property that the number itself does not have. (More formally, &quot;&quot;x&quot; is Richardian&quot; is equivalent to &quot;&quot;x&quot; does &quot;not&quot; have the property designated by the defining expression with which &quot;x&quot; is correlated in the serially ordered set of definitions&quot;.) Thus in this example, 58 is Richardian, but 43 is not. 

Now, since the property of being Richardian is itself a numerical property of integers, it belongs in the list of all definitions of properties. Therefore, the property of being Richardian is assigned some integer, &quot;n&quot;. For example, the definition &quot;being Richardian&quot; might be assigned to the number 92. Finally, the paradox becomes: Is 92 Richardian? Suppose 92 is Richardian. This is only possible if 92 does not have the property designated by the defining expression which it is correlated with. In other words, this means 92 is not Richardian, contradicting our assumption. However, if we suppose 92 is not Richardian, then it does have the defining property which it corresponds to. This, by definition, means that it is Richardian, again contrary to assumption. Thus, the statement &quot;92 is Richardian&quot; cannot consistently be designated as either true or false.

== Relation to predicativism ==

Another opinion concerning Richard&#x27;s paradox relates to mathematical predicativism. By this view, the real numbers are defined in stages, with each stage only making reference to previous stages and other things that have already been defined. From a predicative viewpoint it is not valid to quantify over &quot;all&quot; real numbers in the process of generating a new real number, because this is believed to result in a circularity problem in the definitions. Set theories such as ZFC are not based on this sort of predicative framework, and allow impredicative definitions.

Richard (1905) presented a solution to the paradox from the viewpoint of predicativism. Richard claimed that the flaw of the paradoxical construction was that the expression for the construction of the real number &quot;r&quot; does not actually define a real number unambiguously, because the statement refers to the construction of an infinite set of real numbers, of which &quot;r&quot; itself is a part. Thus, Richard says, the real number &quot;r&quot; will not be included as any &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot;, because the definition of &quot;r&quot; does not meet the criteria for being included in the sequence of definitions used to construct the sequence &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Contemporary mathematicians agree that the definition of &quot;r&quot; is invalid, but for a different reason. They believe the definition of &quot;r&quot; is invalid because there is no well-defined notion of when an English phrase defines a real number, and so there is no unambiguous way to construct the sequence &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

Although Richard&#x27;s solution to the paradox did not gain favor with mathematicians, predicativism is an important part of the study of the foundations of mathematics. Predicativism was first studied in detail by Hermann Weyl in &quot;Das Kontinuum&quot;, wherein he showed that much of elementary real analysis can be conducted in a predicative manner starting with only the natural numbers. More recently, predicativism has been studied by Solomon Feferman, who has used proof theory to explore the relationship between predicative and impredicative systems.

<doc id="97817" wikidata="Q205139" url="?curid=97817" title="Carl Nielsen">
<text>Carl August Nielsen (; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish composer, conductor, and violinist, widely recognized as his country&#x27;s most prominent composer.

Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, &quot;Suite for Strings&quot;, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot; at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death.

Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen&#x27;s career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his &quot;psychological&quot; period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera &quot;Maskarade&quot; and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Johannes Brahms and Edvard Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen&#x27;s sixth and final symphony, &quot;Sinfonia semplice&quot;, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen.

Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through Leonard Bernstein and others. In Denmark, Nielsen&#x27;s reputation was sealed in 2006 when four of his works were listed by the Danish Ministry of Culture amongst the greatest pieces of Danish classical music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the Royal Danish Library, sponsored by the Danish government, completed the &quot;Carl Nielsen Edition&quot;, freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all of Nielsen&#x27;s works, many of which had not been previously published.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===

Nielsen was born on 9 June 1865, the seventh of twelve children in a poor peasant family, at Sortelung near Nørre Lyndelse, south of Odense on the island of Funen. His father, Niels Jørgensen, was a house painter and traditional musician who, with his abilities as a fiddler and cornet player, was in strong demand for local celebrations. Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography (&quot;My Childhood on Funen&quot;). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains, while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837–1881), was a talented musician.

Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: &quot;I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin.&quot; He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He studied violin and piano as a child, and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka that he mentions in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper in a nearby village when he was fourteen. The shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play brass instruments, on 1 November 1879 he became a bugler and alto trombonist in the band of the army&#x27;s 16th Battalion in Odense.

Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three kroner and 45 øre and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances.

=== Studies and early career ===

In 1881, Nielsen began to take his violin playing more seriously, studying privately under Carl Larsen, the sexton at Odense Cathedral. It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for brass instruments, and that he had difficulty in coming to terms with the fact that brass instruments were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to Niels W. Gade, the director of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice, and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.

Though not an outstanding student and composing little, Nielsen progressed well in violin under Valdemar Tofte (1832–1907), and received a solid grounding in music theory from Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann as well as from Orla Rosenhoff (1844–1905), who would remain a valued adviser during his early years as a professional composer. He also studied composition under Gade, whom he liked as a friend but not for his music. Contacts with fellow students and cultured families in Copenhagen, some of whom would become lifelong friends, became equally important. The patchy education resulting from his country background left Nielsen insatiably curious about the arts, philosophy and aesthetics. But, in the opinion of the musicologist David Fanning, it also left him &quot;with a highly personal, common man&#x27;s point of view on those subjects&quot;. He left the Academy at the end of 1886, after graduating with good but not outstanding marks in all subjects. He then went to stay with the retired Odense merchant Jens Georg Nielsen (1820–1901) and his wife at their apartment on Slagelsegade as he was not yet in a position to pay his own way. While there, he fell in love with their 14-year-old daughter Emilie Demant. The affair was to last for the next three years.

On 17 September 1887, Nielsen played the violin in the Tivoli Concert Hall when his &quot;Andante tranquillo e Scherzo&quot; for strings was premiered. Shortly afterwards, on 25 January 1888, his String Quartet in F major was played at one of the private performances of the (Private Chamber Music Society). While Nielsen considered the Quartet in F to be his official debut as a professional composer, a far greater impression was made by his &quot;Suite for Strings&quot;. Performed at Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen on 8 September 1888, it was designated by Nielsen as his Op. 1.

By September 1889 Nielsen had progressed well enough on the violin to gain a position with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen&#x27;s Royal Theatre, then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot; at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen&#x27;s retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910). Between graduation and attaining this position, he made a modest income from private violin lessons while enjoying the continuing support of his patrons, not only Jens Georg Nielsen but also Albert Sachs (born 1846) and Hans Demant (1827–1897) who both ran factories in Odense. After less than a year at the Royal Theatre, Nielsen won a scholarship of 1,800 kroner, giving him the means to spend several months travelling in Europe.
=== Marriage and children ===
While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner&#x27;s music dramas, heard many of Europe&#x27;s leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark&#x27;s English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a &quot;love match&quot;, but also a &quot;meeting of minds&quot;; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a &quot;strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career&quot;. This determination would strain the Nielsens&#x27; marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who pursued extramarital affairs with other women in her absence, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.

Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his &quot;psychological&quot; period. Fanning writes, &quot;At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera &quot;Saul and David&quot; and the Second Symphony (&quot;The Four Temperaments&quot;) and the cantatas and &quot;. Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer&#x27;s life.

Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate daughter was born – Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Møller (1893–1978), a medical doctor who became a professor at the University of Copenhagen and director of the polyclinic at the National Hospital. The younger daughter Anne Marie, who graduated from the Copenhagen Academy of Arts, married the Hungarian violinist Emil Telmányi (1892–1988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen&#x27;s music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen&#x27;s son, Hans Børge, was disabled as a result of meningitis and spent most of his life away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.

=== Mature composer ===

At first, Nielsen&#x27;s works did not gain sufficient recognition for him to be able to support himself. During the concert which saw the premiere of his First Symphony on 14 March 1894 conducted by Svendsen, Nielsen played in the second violin section. The symphony was a great success when played in Berlin in 1896, contributing significantly to his reputation. He was increasingly in demand to write incidental music for the theatre as well as cantatas for special occasions, both of which provided a welcome source of additional income. Fanning comments on the relationship which developed between his programmatic and symphonic works: &quot;Sometimes he would find stageworthy ideas in his supposedly pure orchestral music; sometimes a text or scenario forced him to invent vivid musical imagery which he could later turn to more abstract use.&quot;

Nielsen&#x27;s cantata &quot;Hymnus amoris&quot; for soloists, chorus and orchestra was first performed at Copenhagen&#x27;s Musikforeningen (The Music Society) on 27 April 1897. It was inspired by Titian&#x27;s painting &quot;Miracle of the Jealous Husband&quot; which Nielsen had seen on his honeymoon in Italy in 1891. On one of the copies, he wrote: &quot;To my own Marie! These tones in praise of love are nothing compared to the real thing.&quot;

Beginning in 1901, Nielsen received a modest state pension – initially 800 kroner per annum, growing to 7,500 kroner by 1927 – to augment his violinist&#x27;s salary. This allowed him to stop taking private pupils and left him more time to compose. From 1903, he also had an annual retainer from his principal publisher, . Between 1905 and 1914 he served as second conductor at the Royal Theatre. For his son-in-law, Emil Telmányi, Nielsen wrote his Violin Concerto, Op. 33 (1911). From 1914 to 1926, he conducted the Musikforeningen orchestra. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen, and continued to work there until his death.
The strain of dual careers and constant separation from his wife led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen, regularly retreating also to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in Gothenburg. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his Fourth (1914–16) and Fifth symphonies (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication of many of his major works, including &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Pan and Syrinx&quot;.

The sixth and final symphony, &quot;Sinfonia semplice&quot;, was written in 1924–25. After suffering a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; in an article in &quot;Politiken&quot; on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end ... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.

=== Final years and death ===
Nielsen&#x27;s final large-scale orchestral works were his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: &quot;If ever there was music from another planet, this is surely it. Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing.&quot; Nielsen&#x27;s last musical composition, the organ work &quot;Commotio&quot;, was premiered posthumously in 1931 in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Lübeck.

During his final years, Nielsen produced a short book of essays entitled &quot;Living Music&quot; (1925), followed in 1927 by his memoir &quot;Min Fynske Barndom&quot;. In 1926 he wrote in his diary &quot;My home soil pulls me more and more like a long sucking kiss. Does it mean that I shall finally return and rest in the earth of Funen? Then it must be in the place where I was born: Sortelung, Frydenlands parish&quot;.

This was not to be. Nielsen was admitted to Copenhagen&#x27;s National Hospital (Rigshospitalet) on 1 October 1931 following a series of heart attacks. He died there at ten minutes past midnight on 3 October, surrounded by his family. His last words to them were &quot;You are standing here as if you were waiting for something&quot;.

He was buried in Copenhagen&#x27;s Vestre Cemetery; all the music at his funeral, including the hymns, was the work of the composer. After his death, his wife was commissioned to sculpt a monument to him, to be erected in central Copenhagen. She wrote: &quot;I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to sit there between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen.&quot; Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that erection of the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. The Carl Nielsen Monument was finally unveiled in 1939.

== Music ==

Nielsen&#x27;s works are sometimes referred to by CNW numbers, based on the &quot;Catalogue of Carl Nielsen&#x27;s Works&quot; (CNW) published online by the Danish Royal Library in 2015. The CNW catalogue is intended to replace the 1965 catalogue compiled by Dan Fog and Torben Schousboe (FS numbers).

=== Musical style ===
In his &quot;Lives of the Great Composers&quot;, the music critic Harold C. Schonberg emphasizes the breadth of Nielsen&#x27;s compositions, his energetic rhythms, generous orchestration and his individuality. In comparing him with Jean Sibelius, he considers he had &quot;just as much sweep, even more power, and a more universal message&quot;. The Oxford University music professor Daniel M. Grimley qualifies Nielsen as &quot;one of the most playful, life-affirming, and awkward voices in twentieth-century music&quot; thanks to the &quot;melodic richness and harmonic vitality&quot; of his work. Anne-Marie Reynolds, author of &quot;Carl Nielsen&#x27;s Voice: His Songs in Context&quot;, cites Robert Simpson&#x27;s view that &quot;all of his music is vocal in origin&quot;, maintaining that song-writing strongly influenced Nielsen&#x27;s development as a composer.

The Danish sociologist Benedikte Brincker observes that the perception of Nielsen and his music in his home country is rather different from his international appreciation. His interest and background in folk music had special resonance for Danes, and this was intensified during the nationalistic movements of the 1930s and during World War II, when singing was an important basis for the Danes to distinguish themselves from their German enemies. Nielsen&#x27;s songs retain an important place in Danish culture and education. The musicologist Niels Krabbe describes the popular image of Nielsen in Denmark as being like &quot;the ugly duckling syndrome&quot; – a reference to the tale of the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen – whereby &quot;a poor boy ... passing through adversity and frugality ... marches into Copenhagen and ... comes to conquer the position as the uncrowned King&quot;.

While outside Denmark Nielsen is largely thought of as a composer of orchestral music and the opera &quot;Maskarade&quot;, in his own country he is more of a national symbol. These two sides were officially brought together in Denmark in 2006 when the Ministry of Culture issued a list of the twelve greatest Danish musical works, which included Nielsen&#x27;s opera &quot;Maskarade&quot;, his Fourth Symphony, and a pair of his Danish folk songs. Krabbe asks the rhetorical question: &quot;Can &#x27;the national&#x27; in Nielsen be demonstrated in the music in the form of particular themes, harmonies, sounds, forms, etc., or is it a pure construct of reception history?&quot;

Nielsen himself was ambiguous about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He wrote to the Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 &quot;I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What do you think about songs sung in unison? We must go back ... to the pure and the clear.&quot; On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 &quot;Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does ... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request.&quot;

Nielsen studied Renaissance polyphony closely, which accounts for some of the melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his &quot;Tre Motetter&quot; (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish critics, Nielsen&#x27;s music initially had a neo-classical sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer Robert Simpson called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen&#x27;s music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies. There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of acciaccaturas or appoggiaturas, or his frequent use of a flattened seventh and minor third in his works, as being typically Danish. The composer himself wrote &quot;The intervals, as I see it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music ... [I]t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note.&quot;

Nielsen&#x27;s philosophy of music style is perhaps summed up in his advice in a 1907 letter to the Norwegian composer Knut Harder: &quot;You have ... fluency, so far, so good; but I advise you again and again, my dear Mr. Harder; &quot;Tonality, Clarity, Strength&quot;.&quot;

=== Symphonies ===

Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen&#x27;s individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).

The title of Symphony No. 3, &quot;Sinfonia Espansiva&quot; (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the &quot;outward growth of the mind&#x27;s scope&quot;. It fully exploits Nielsen&#x27;s technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, &quot;The Inextinguishable&quot; (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as &quot;the life force, the unquenchable will to live&quot;. It premiered in February 1916 in Copenhagen, two weeks after its completion, and was performed in Warsaw, London, Paris, and St Louis the following year.

Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen&#x27;s music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled &quot;Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony)&quot;, the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen&#x27;s other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.

=== Operas and cantatas ===

Nielsen&#x27;s two operas are very different in style. The four-act (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul&#x27;s jealousy of the young David while (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. &quot;Saul and David&quot; received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 &quot;Masquerade&quot; was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark&#x27;s national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying &quot;old Copenhagen&quot; atmosphere.

Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed (&quot;Hymn of Love&quot;), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper &quot;Dannebrog&quot;, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as &quot;a decisive victory&quot; for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of &quot;Nationaltidende&quot; welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. (&quot;The Sleep&quot;), Op. 18, Nielsen&#x27;s second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. (&quot;Springtime on Funen&quot;), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen&#x27;s compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen&#x27;s countryside.

=== Concertos ===
Nielsen wrote three concertos: the Violin Concerto, Op. 33 is a middle-period work, from 1911, which lies within the tradition of European classicism, whereas the Flute Concerto (without opus number) of 1926 and the Clarinet Concerto, Op. 57 which followed in 1928 are late works, influenced by the modernism of the 1920s and, according to the Danish musicologist Herbert Rosenberg, the product of &quot;an extremely experienced composer who knows how to avoid inessentials.&quot; Unlike Nielsen&#x27;s later works, the Violin Concerto has a distinct, melody-oriented neo-classical structure. The Flute Concerto, in two movements, was written for the flautist Holger Gilbert-Jespersen, a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet which had premiered Nielsen&#x27;s Wind Quintet (1922). In contrast to the rather traditional style of the Violin Concerto, it reflects the modernistic trends of the period. The first movement, for example, switches between D minor, E-flat minor and F major before the flute comes to the fore with a cantabile theme in E major. The Clarinet Concerto was also written for a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet, Aage Oxenvad. Nielsen stretches the capacities of instrument and player to the utmost; the concerto has just one continuous movement and contains a struggle between the soloist and the orchestra and between the two principal competing keys, F major and E major.

The wind concertos present many examples of what Nielsen called (&quot;objectification&quot;). By this term he meant giving instrumentalists freedom of interpretation and performance within the bounds set out by the score.

=== Orchestral music ===
Nielsen&#x27;s earliest work composed specifically for orchestra was the immediately successful &quot;Suite for Strings&quot;, Op. 1 (1888), which evoked Scandinavian Romanticism as expressed by Grieg and Svendsen. The work marked an important milestone in Nielsen&#x27;s career as it was not only his first real success but it was also the first of his pieces he conducted himself when it was played in Odense a month later.

The &quot;Helios Overture&quot;, Op. 17 (1903) stems from Nielsen&#x27;s stay in Athens which inspired him to compose a work depicting the sun rising and setting over the Aegean Sea. The score is a showpiece for orchestra, and has been amongst Nielsen&#x27;s most popular works. (&quot;Saga Dream&quot;), Op. 39 (1907–08) is a tone poem for orchestra based on the Icelandic Njal&#x27;s Saga. In Nielsen&#x27;s words:
There are among other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely alongside one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way – differently and randomly for each performance – until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.

&quot;At the Bier of a Young Artist&quot; () for string orchestra was written for the funeral of the Danish painter Oluf Hartmann in January 1910 and was also played at Nielsen&#x27;s own funeral. &quot;Pan and Syrinx&quot; (), a vigorous nine-minute symphonic poem inspired by Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, was premiered in 1911. The Rhapsodic Overture, &quot;An Imaginary Trip to the Faroe Islands&quot; (), draws on Faroese folk tunes but also contains freely composed sections.

Among Nielsen&#x27;s orchestral works for the stage are &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1919) and (The Mother), Op. 41 (1920). &quot;Aladdin&quot; was written to accompany a production of Adam Oehlenschläger&#x27;s fairy tale at The Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. The complete score, lasting over 80 minutes, is Nielsen&#x27;s longest work apart from his operas, but a shorter orchestral suite consisting of the &quot;Oriental March&quot;, &quot;Hindu Dance&quot; and &quot;Negro Dance&quot; is often performed. , written to celebrate the reunification of Southern Jutland with Denmark, was first performed in 1921; it is a setting of patriotic verses written for the occasion.
=== Chamber music ===

Nielsen composed several chamber music works, some of them still high on the international repertoire. The Wind Quintet, one of his most popular pieces, was composed in 1922 specifically for the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. Simpson, explaining that Nielsen&#x27;s fondness of wind instruments was closely related to his love of nature, writes: &quot;He was also intensely interested in human character, and in the Wind Quintet composed deliberately for five friends; each part is cunningly made to suit the individuality of each player.&quot;
Nielsen wrote four string quartets. The First String Quartet No. 1 in G minor, Op. 13 (1889, revised 1900) contains a &quot;Résumé&quot; section in the finale, bringing together themes from the first, third and fourth movements. The Second String Quartet No. 2 in F minor, Op. 5 appeared in 1890 and the Third String Quartet in E-flat major, Op. 14 in 1898. The music historian Jan Smaczny suggests that in this work &quot;the handling of texture is confident and far less derivative than in earlier works ... [the quartet] prompts the most regret that Nielsen did not pursue the genre further ... to parallel his later symphonic development&quot;. The Fourth String Quartet in F major (1904) initially received a mixed reception, with critics uncertain about its reserved style. Nielsen revised it several times, the final version in 1919 being listed as his Op. 44.

The violin was Nielsen&#x27;s own instrument and he composed four large-scale chamber works for it. The departures from standard procedures in the First Sonata, Op. 9 (1895), including its often sudden modulations and its terse thematic material, disconcerted Danish critics at its first performance. The Second Sonata, Op. 35 of 1912 was written for the violinist Peder Møller who earlier that year had premiered the composer&#x27;s Violin Concerto. The work is an example of the composer&#x27;s progressive tonality since, although it is stated to be in the key of G minor, the first and final movements end in different keys. The critic Emilius Bangert wrote of the premiere (which was given by Axel Gade), &quot;The overall impression was of a beautiful, unbroken line – a flow of notes – where in particular a wonderful second subject in the first part and the pure, high sphere of the last part were captivating&quot;. Two other works are for violin solo. The &quot;Prelude, Theme and Variations&quot;, Op. 48 (1923) was written for Telmányi, and, like Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Chaconne&quot; for piano, Op. 32, was inspired by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The &quot;Preludio e Presto&quot;, Op. 52 (1928) was written as a tribute for the sixtieth birthday of the composer Fini Henriques.

=== Keyboard works ===
Although Nielsen came to compose mainly at the piano, he only composed directly for it occasionally over a period of 40 years, creating works often with a distinctive style which slowed their international acceptance. Nielsen&#x27;s own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three wax cylinders marked &quot;Carl Nielsen&quot; at the State Archives in Aarhus, seems to have been mediocre. Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist John Ogdon, John Horton commented on the early pieces: &quot;Nielsen&#x27;s technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs&quot;, whilst characterising the later pieces as &quot;major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music&quot;. The anti-romantic tone of the &quot;Symphonic Suite&quot;, Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as &quot;nothing less than a clenched fist straight in the face of all established musical convention&quot;. In Nielsen&#x27;s words, the &quot;Chaconne&quot;, Op. 32 (1917) was &quot;a really big piece, and I think effective&quot;. It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the chaconne for solo violin, but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach&#x27;s music by composers such as Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni. Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the &quot;Theme and Variations&quot;, Op. 40, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of Max Reger, of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend &quot;I think that the public will be utterly unable to grasp Reger&#x27;s work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards ... Richard Strauss&quot;.

All Nielsen&#x27;s organ works were late compositions. The Danish organist Finn Viderø suggests that his interest was prompted by the (Organ reform movement), and the renewal of the front pipes of the Schnitger organ in the St. Jacobi Church, Hamburg, from 1928 to 1930. Nielsen&#x27;s last major work – , Op. 58, a 22-minute piece for organ – was composed between June 1930 and February 1931, only a few months before his death.

=== Songs and hymns ===
Over the years, Nielsen wrote the music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by well-known Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, many of them are still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as &quot;the most representative part of the country&#x27;s most representative composer&#x27;s output&quot;. In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But it is also clear that a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.

Of great significance was Nielsen&#x27;s contribution to the 1922 publication, &quot; Folkehøjskolens Melodibog (The Folk High School Songbook)&quot;, of which he was one of the editors together with Thomas Laub, Oluf Ring and Thorvald Aagaard. The book contained about 600 melodies, of which about 200 were composed by the editors, and was intended to provide a repertoire for communal singing, an integral part of Danish folk culture. The collection was extremely popular and became embedded in the Danish educational system. During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, mass song gatherings, using these melodies, were part of Denmark&#x27;s &quot;spiritual re-armament&quot;, and after the war in 1945 Nielsen&#x27;s contributions were characterised by one writer as &quot;shining jewels in our treasure-chest of patriotic songs&quot;. This remains a significant factor in Danish assessment of the composer.

=== Editions ===
Between 1994 and 2009 a complete new edition of Nielsen&#x27;s works, the &quot;Carl Nielsen Edition&quot;, was commissioned by the Danish Government (at a cost of over 40 million kroner). For many of the works, including the operas &quot;Maskarade&quot; and &quot;Saul and David&quot;, and the complete &quot;Aladdin&quot; music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances. The scores are now all available for download free of charge at the website of the Danish Royal Library (which also owns most of Nielsen&#x27;s music manuscripts).

== Reception ==
Unlike that of his contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen&#x27;s reputation abroad did not start to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started to become part of the world repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of &quot;Hymnus amoris&quot; that he received support from the critics, to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of &quot;Masquerade&quot;.

Within two months of its successful premiere at the Odd Fellows Concert Hall in Copenhagen on 28 February 1912, the Third Symphony (&quot;Espansiva)&quot; was in the repertoire of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, and by 1913 it had seen performances in Stuttgart, Stockholm and Helsinki. The symphony was the most popular of all Nielsen&#x27;s works during his lifetime and was also played in Berlin, Hamburg, London and Gothenburg. Other works caused some uncertainty, even in Denmark. After the premiere of the Fifth Symphony (1922) one critic wrote: &quot;The treasure of Danish symphonies and Carl Nielsen&#x27;s own output have been enriched by a strange and highly original work.&quot; Another, however, described it as a &quot;bloody, clenched fist in the face of an unsuspecting snob audience&quot;, also qualifying it as &quot;filthy music from trenches&quot;.

At the end of the 1940s two major biographies of Nielsen appeared in Danish, dominating opinion of the composer&#x27;s life and work for several decades. Robert Simpson&#x27;s book &quot;Carl Nielsen, Symphonist&quot; (first edition 1952) was the earliest large-scale study in English.

An international breakthrough came in 1962 when Leonard Bernstein recorded the Fifth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic for CBS. The recording helped Nielsen&#x27;s music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country and is considered one of the finest recorded accounts of the symphony. Nielsen&#x27;s centenary in 1965 was widely celebrated, both in terms of performances and publications, and Bernstein was awarded the Sonning Prize for his recording of the Third Symphony. In 1988 Nielsen&#x27;s diaries and his letters to Anne Marie were published, and these, together with a 1991 biography by Jørgen Jensen using this new material, led to a revised objective assessment of the composer&#x27;s personality. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the occasion of Nielsen&#x27;s 125th anniversary in 1990, the music critic Andrew Pincus recalled that 25 years earlier Bernstein had believed the world was ready to accept the Dane as the equal of Jean Sibelius, speaking of &quot;his rough charm, his swing, his drive, his rhythmic surprises, his strange power of harmonic and tonal relationships – and especially his constant unpredictability&quot; (which Pincus believed was still a challenge for audiences). Biographies and studies in English in the 1990s helped to establish Nielsen&#x27;s status worldwide, to the point at which his music has become a regular feature of concert programming in Western countries.

Writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2008, the American music critic Alex Ross compares the &quot;brute strength&quot; of Nielsen&#x27;s symphonies to Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; and Fifth Symphony but explains that only now were the Americans slowly beginning to appreciate the Danish composer.

Nielsen did not record any of his works. However, three younger contemporary conductors who had worked with him, Thomas Jensen, Launy Grøndahl, and Erik Tuxen, did record his symphonies and other orchestral works with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra between 1946 and 1952. Jensen also made the first LP recording of the Fifth Symphony in 1954. Work carried out by the recently published complete &quot;Carl Nielsen Edition&quot; has revealed that the scores used in these recordings often differ from the composer&#x27;s original intentions and thus the supposed authenticity of these recordings is now debatable.

There are now numerous recordings of all Nielsen&#x27;s major works, including complete cycles of the symphonies conducted by, amongst others, Sir Colin Davis, Herbert Blomstedt and Sakari Oramo. Over 50 recordings have been made of Nielsen&#x27;s Wind Quintet.

== Legacy ==

From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen&#x27;s private students who helped with the orchestration of &quot;Aladdin&quot;. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen&#x27;s death.

The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen&#x27;s works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings.
The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral.

In his home country, the Carl Nielsen Museum, in Odense, is dedicated to Nielsen and his wife, Anne Marie. The composer is featured on the 100 kroner note issued by the Danish National Bank from 1997 to 2010. His image was selected in recognition of his contribution to Danish music compositions such as his opera &quot;Maskarade&quot;, his &quot;Espansiva&quot; symphony and his many songs including &quot;Danmark, nu blunder den lyse nat&quot;.

Several special events were scheduled on or around 9 June 2015 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Nielsen&#x27;s birth. In addition to many performances in Denmark, concerts were programmed in cities across Europe, including London, Leipzig, Kraków, Gothenburg, Helsinki and Vienna, and even further afield in Japan, Egypt and New York. For 9 June, Nielsen&#x27;s birthday, the Danish National Symphony Orchestra presented a programme in Copenhagen&#x27;s DR Concert Hall featuring &quot;Hymnus amoris&quot;, the &quot;Clarinet Concerto&quot; and &quot;Symphony No. 4&quot; for a broadcast extending across Europe and the United States. The Danish Royal Opera has programmed &quot;Maskarade&quot; and a new production (directed by David Pountney) of &quot;Saul og David&quot;. During 2015, the Danish Quartet scheduled performances of Nielsen&#x27;s string quartets in Denmark, Israel, Germany, Norway and the UK (at the Cheltenham Music Festival). In the UK, the BBC Philharmonic prepared a concert series on Nielsen beginning on 9 June in Manchester. Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Maskarade&quot; overture was also the first item for the opening night of the 2015 BBC Promenade Concerts in London, while his compositions featured in five other concerts of the Prom season. The city of Odense, which has strong connections with Nielsen, developed an extensive programme of concerts and cultural events for the anniversary year.

Minor planet 6058 Carlnielsen is named in his honor.

<doc id="97827" wikidata="Q178283" url="?curid=97827" title="County Limerick">
<text>County Limerick () is a western county in Ireland. It is in the province of Munster and is located in the Mid-West which comprises part of the Southern Region. It is named after the city of Limerick. Limerick City and County Council is the local council for the county. The county&#x27;s population at the 2022 census was 209,536 of whom 102,287 lived in Limerick City, the county capital.

==Geography==

Limerick borders four other counties: Kerry to the west, Clare to the north, Tipperary to the east, and Cork to the south. It is the fifth-largest of Munster&#x27;s six counties in size and the second-largest by population. The River Shannon flows through the city of Limerick, then continues as the Shannon Estuary until it meets the Atlantic Ocean past the far western end of the county. Because the estuary is shallow, the county&#x27;s most important port is several kilometres west of the city, at Foynes. Limerick City is the county town and is also Ireland&#x27;s third-largest city. Newcastle West, Kilmallock and Abbeyfeale are other important towns in the county.

===Baronies===
There are fourteen historic baronies in the county. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under &quot;Administrative units&quot;.
* Clanwilliam – 
* Connello Lower – 
* Connello Upper – 
* Coonagh – 
* Coshlea – 
* Coshma – 
* Glenquin – 
* Kenry – 
* Kilmallock – 
* North Liberties – 
* Owneybeg – 
* Pubblebrien – 
* Shanid – 
* Smallcounty – 

==Most populous towns==

Limerick City is the county town and is shown in bold.

==Physical geography==

One possible meaning for the county&#x27;s name in Irish &quot;Luimneach&quot; is &quot;the flat area&quot;; this description is accurate as the land consists mostly of a fertile limestone plain. Moreover, the county is ringed by mountains: the Slieve Felims to the northeast, the Galtees to the southeast, the Ballyhoura Mountains to the south, and the Mullaghareirk Mountains to the southwest and west. The highest point in the county is located in its southeast corner at Galtymore (919 m), which separates Limerick from County Tipperary. Limerick shares the 3rd-highest county peak in Ireland with Tipperary. The county is not simply a plain, its topography consists of hills and ridges. The eastern part of the county is part of the Golden Vale, which is well known for dairy produce and consists of rolling low hills. This gives way to very flat land around the centre of the county, with the exception being Knockfierna at 288 m high. Towards the west, the Mullaghareirk Mountains (&quot;Mullach an Radhairc&quot; in Irish, roughly meaning &quot;mountains of the view&quot;) push across the county offering extensive views east over the county and west into County Kerry.

Volcanic rock is to be found in numerous areas in the county, at Carrigogunnell, at Knockfierna, and principally at Pallasgreen/Kilteely in the east, which has been described as the most compact and for its size one of the most varied and complete carboniferous volcanic districts in either Britain and Ireland.

Tributaries of the Shannon drainage basin located in the county include the rivers Mulcair, Loobagh, Maigue, Camogue, Morning Star, Deel, and the Feale.

== History ==
It is thought that humans had established themselves in the Lough Gur area of the county as early as 3000 BC, while megalithic remains found at Duntryleague date back further to 3500 BC. The arrival of the Celts around 400 BC brought about the division of the county into petty kingdoms or &quot;túatha&quot;.

From the 4th to the 11th century, the ancient kingdom of the Uí Fidgenti was approximately co-extensive with what is now County Limerick, with some of the easternmost part the domain of the Eóganacht Áine. The establishment of Limerick as a town and base by the Danes in the mid 900&#x27;s, and their alliance with Irish families, including their alliance with Donnubán mac Cathail of the O&#x27;Donovans, resulted in significant conflicts with neighbouring clans, principally the O&#x27;Briens of Dál gCais, who raided into the Limerick area on a regular basis. The O&#x27;Briens retained their political power until late in the 1100s. The establishment of King John&#x27;s Castle in Limerick, and the granting of formerly Ui Fidgenti lands to the FitzGeralds, both circa 1200, and the resultant competition for Ui Fidgenti lands by other Anglo-Norman families resulted in a transfer of power from the Ui Fidgenti&#x27;s leading families (O&#x27;Donovan and Collins) to the new landholders. The ancestors of both Michael Collins and the famous O&#x27;Connells of Derrynane were also among the septs of the Uí Fidgenti.

As the Ui Fidgenti were the ruling clan in Limerick after 400 a.d., the Uí Fidgenti still made a substantial contribution to the population of the central and western regions of County Limerick. Their capital was Dún Eochair, the great earthworks of which still remain and can be found close to the modern town of Bruree, on the River Maigue. Bruree is a derivation of Brugh Righ, or Fort of the King. Catherine Coll, the mother of Éamon de Valera, was a native of Bruree and this is where he was taken by her brother to be raised.

St. Patrick brought Christianity to Limerick area in the 5th century. Various annals record that St. Patrick quarrelled with the chief of the Ui Fidgenti (who, though hosting St. Patrick, had his horses stolen as he journeyed into their territory) but was embraced by the brother of the chief. The adoption of Christianity resulted in the establishment of important monasteries in Limerick, at Ardpatrick, Mungret and Kileedy. From this golden age in Ireland of learning and art (5th – 9th Centuries) comes one of Ireland&#x27;s greatest artefacts, The Ardagh Chalice, a masterpiece of metalwork, which was found in a west Limerick fort in 1868. It is believed that the chalice had been taken by raiding Danes during the 9th century, ending up in the territory of their Irish allies, the O&#x27;Donovans of the Ui Fidgenti.

Following the establishment of the Ui Fidgenti circa 377 a.d., there were few significant changes in political control until the arrival of the Vikings in the 9th century, which ultimately brought about the establishment of the city on an island on the River Shannon in 922. The death of Domnall Mór Ua Briain, King of Munster in 1194 resulted in the invading Normans taking control of Limerick. In 1210, the County of Limerick was formally established as Ui Fidgenti lands were granted to what would become the Fitzgerald dynasty. Over time, the Normans became &quot;more Irish than the Irish themselves&quot; as the saying goes. The Tudors in England wanted to curb the power of these Gaelicised Norman Rulers and centralise all power in their hands, so they established colonies of English in the county. Distrust by England of the leading Fitzgerald families, and the execution of several of the Fitzgeralds of Kildare, precipitated a revolt against English Rule in 1569. Th resultant savage war in Munster, known as the Desmond Rebellions, laid waste to the province and ended with confiscation of the vast estates of the Geraldines and other Irish families that had participated in the ten years of war. 

The county was to be further ravaged by war over the next century. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Limerick city was taken in a siege by Catholic general Garret Barry in 1642. The county was not fought over for most of the Irish Confederate Wars, of 1641–53, being safely behind the front lines of the Catholic Confederate Ireland. However, it became a battleground during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649–53. The invasion of the forces of Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s included a twelve-month siege of the city by Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army led by Henry Ireton. The city finally surrendered in October 1651. One of Cromwell&#x27;s generals, Hardress Waller was granted lands at Castletown near Kilcornan in County Limerick. During the Williamite War in Ireland (1689–1691) the city was to endure two further sieges, one in 1690 and another in 1691. It was during the 1690 siege that the infamous destruction of the Williamite guns at Ballyneety, near Pallasgreen was carried out by General Patrick Sarsfield. The Catholic Irish, comprising the vast majority of the population, had eagerly supported the Jacobite cause, however, the second siege of Limerick resulted in a defeat to the Williamites. Sarsfield managed to force the Williamites to sign the Treaty of Limerick, the terms of which were satisfactory to the Irish. However, the Treaty was subsequently dishonoured by the English and the city became known as the City of the Broken Treaty.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw a long period of persecution against the Catholic majority, many of whom lived in poverty. In spite of this oppression, however, the famous Maigue Poets strove to keep alive their ancient Gaelic Poetry in towns like Croom and Bruree. The Great Famine of the 1840s set in motion mass emigration and a huge decline in Irish as a spoken language in the county. This began to change around the beginning of the 20th century, as changes in law from the British Government enabled the farmers of the county to purchase lands they had previously only held as tenants, paying high rent to absentee landlords.

Limerick saw much fighting during the War of Independence of 1919 to 1921 particularly in the east of the county. The subsequent Irish Civil War saw bitter fighting between the newly established Irish Free State soldiers and IRA &quot;Irregulars&quot;, especially in the city (See Irish Free State offensive).

==Local government and politics==

===Local government===
The local government area of Limerick City and County is under the jurisdiction of Limerick City and County Council. The council has responsibility for local services such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, collection of motor taxation, local roads and social housing in the city. The council comprises elected councillors with an appointed full-time CEO as both city and county manager. Until June 2014 the county was divided into two separate local government areas, administered by separate authorities: Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council. In October 2012 the Government of Ireland published &quot;Putting People First: Action Programme for Effective Local Government&quot; which set out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local government in Ireland. Among the recommendations was the merging of the city and the county of Limerick into a single local government area. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 implemented this change, which came into effect on 1 June 2014. This change saw a reduction in five in the total number of councillors representing the city and county.

===Councillors===
The current local electoral areas are:
* Adare-Rathkeale (6 seats)
* Cappamore-Kilmallock (7 seats)
* Limerick City East (7 seats)
* Limerick City North (7 seats)
* Limerick City West (7 seats)
* Newcastle West (6 seats)

The three city LEAs form the Metropolitan District of Limerick City. Each of the other LEAs forms its own municipal district.

===Constituencies===
The county is part of the South constituency for European elections. For elections to Dáil Éireann, the county is part of two constituencies: Limerick City (4 seats), and Limerick County (3 seats).

==Irish language==
There are 2,322 Irish speakers in County Limerick attending the six gaelscoileanna (Irish language primary schools) and three gaelcholáistí (Irish language secondary schools).

==Culture==
In 2014, Limerick became Ireland&#x27;s inaugural National City of Culture, with a wide variety of artistic and cultural events occurring at various locations around the city. The Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city&#x27;s chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. Theatres include the Limetree Theatre, Mary I; the University Concert Hall and the Millennium Theatre, LIT all in the city. Others include the Friar&#x27;s Gate in Kilmallock and the Honey Fitz in Lough Gur. The city has an active music scene, which has produced bands such as The Cranberries. The Limerick Art Gallery, the Limerick School of Art and Design, and Ormston House cater for painting, sculpture and performance art of all styles.

Limerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D&#x27;Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Its most famous acting son is Richard Harris. The city is the setting for Frank McCourt&#x27;s memoir Angela&#x27;s Ashes and the film adaptation. A limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem&#x27;s connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets who were based in Croom and its environs, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included &quot;Will [or won&#x27;t] you come (up) to Limerick?&quot; Riverfest is an annual summer festival held in Limerick. The festival was begun in 2004. Other festivals include the Knights of Westfest in Newcastle West, Fleadh by the Feale in Abbeyfeale and the Ballyhoura International Walking Festival. The west of the county is known for its Irish music, song and dance and is part of the Sliabh Luachra area of traditional Irish music along the borders of County Cork and County Kerry.

==Transport==

===Rail===
The main railway station in Limerick is Colbert station, named after West Limerick man Con Colbert who was executed following the Easter Rising of 1916. Limerick has three operational railway lines passing through it,
* the Limerick–Ballybrophy railway line leading to North Tipperary stopping at Castleconnell, Birdhill, Nenagh Cloughjordan and Roscrea
* the Ennis line through County Clare which continues on to Galway as part of the Western Railway Corridor
* the Limerick Junction line which is the busiest line, connecting Limerick to the Cork–Dublin Heuston line and to the Limerick Junction–Clonmel–Waterford line.

In addition, a line exists leading to Foynes however the last revenue service was in 2000.

=== Road &amp; bus ===
The M7 is the main road linking Limerick with Dublin. The M/N20 connects the county with Cork. The N21 road links Limerick with Tralee and travels through some of the main county towns such as Adare, Rathkeale, Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale. The N/M18 road links the county to Ennis and Galway while the N24 continues southeastwards from Limerick towards Waterford travelling through villages such as Pallasgreen and Oola. The R513 is a spur road off the N24 and links up with the villages of Caherconlish, Hospital and Ballylanders before continuing on to Mitchelstown. The N69, a secondary route travels from Limerick City along the Shannon Estuary through Clarina, Kildimo, Askeaton, Foynes &amp; Glin and continues towards Listowel in County Kerry. It is the main road linking the Port of Foynes with Limerick city, although plans are in place to upgrade this road to motorway status. The county&#x27;s regional/national bus hub is located beside Colbert Station and connects most parts of the city and county.

=== Air ===
Although, no commercial airports are situated in County Limerick, the region&#x27;s needs are serviced from Shannon Airport situated 25 km over the border in County Clare which has many flights to Europe and North America. However, some in the south of the county may also use Kerry Airport and Cork Airport which are also within 1 hour&#x27;s drive. Coonagh Aerodrome located just outside the city close to the Clare border is used for light pleasure craft. Foynes, a village in the west of the county, had a unique part to play in the development of aviation. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, land-based planes lacked sufficient flying range for Atlantic crossings. Foynes was the last port of call on its eastern shore for seaplanes. As a result, Foynes would become one of the biggest civilian airports in Europe during World War II. Surveying flights for flying boat operations were made by Charles Lindbergh in 1933 and a terminal was begun in 1935. The first transatlantic proving flights were operated on 5 July 1937 with a Pan Am Sikorsky S-42 service from Botwood, Newfoundland and Labrador on the Bay of Exploits and a BOAC Short Empire service from Foynes with successful transits of twelve and fifteen-and-a-quarter hours respectively. Services to New York, Southampton, Montreal, Poole and Lisbon followed, the first non-stop New York service operating on 22 June 1942 in 25 hours 40 minutes. All of this changed following the construction and opening in 1942 of Shannon Airport on flat bogland on the northern bank of the Estuary. Foynes flying-boat station closed in 1946.

=== Sea ===
Originally Limerick port was located near the confluence of the Abbey and Shannon rivers at King&#x27;s Island. Today the port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road and is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company (SFPC) who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary. It is a general-purpose facility port. Plans to close the port and relocate all activity to the deepwater facility further downstream at Foynes have been abandoned. The plans included a major regeneration of the dockland area. Foynes is the main deepwater commercial port. SFPC is the second largest port facility in Ireland, handling over 10 million tonnes of cargo annually through the six terminals currently operational.

== Sport ==
Rugby union is popular in the county. Some of Ireland&#x27;s most celebrated teams are situated in the city; Garryowen, Shannon, Old Crescent, Young Munster and UL Bohemians. Bruff RFC, another AIL team, are located near the village of Bruff in the south of the county. Thomond Park is the home of the Munster Rugby team, who enjoy enthusiastic support throughout the county.

Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) games are more popular in the parts outside of the city. Hurling is popular in east, mid and south Limerick. Limerick GAA board plays its home games at the Gaelic Grounds in the city. The county hurling team has won the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship twelve times, the last in 2023. The county has also won 20 Munster Championships, last in 2019 and 12 National Hurling Leagues, the last success coming in 2019. The Limerick Senior Hurling Championship is also one of the strongest club championships in the country. Historically it has been dominated by two clubs, Ahane and Patrickswell. Clubs from the county have won the Munster Senior Club Championship six times, with Na Piarsaigh becoming the first team from the county to win the All-Ireland Senior Club hurling final when they beat Cushendall of Antrim 2–25 to 2–14 on 17 March 2016.

The other GAA sport of Gaelic football is more popular in west Limerick, particularly along the Shannon Estuary west of Askeaton and along the Kerry border. There are also football strongholds in the southeast of the county and on the eastern edges of the city. Although one of the strongest teams in the country during the early years of the GAA, the game in the county was overshadowed by hurling throughout the 20th century and its last success in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, was in 1896. However, Limerick footballers have seen a reversal of fortunes in recent years and contested successive Munster Senior Football Championship finals in 2003 and 2004.

Treaty United play in the FAI First Division, the second tier of Irish soccer. The club has won the Premier Division twice in 1960 and 1980. They have also won the FAI Cup twice in 1971 and 1982. They currently play in the Markets Field.

The city also has one of Ireland&#x27;s two swimming pools, at the University of Limerick Sports Arena, as well as one of Ireland&#x27;s top basketball teams, the UL Eagles. The team plays in the Irish Premier League. Their home is also at the University Campus.

Limerick is also the hometown of WBO World Middleweight boxing Champion Andy Lee, who defeated Matt Korobov on 13 December 2014, in Las Vegas. He became the first Irishman to win a world title on American soil since 1934.

<text>Nuclear technology is technology that involves the nuclear reactions of atomic nuclei. Among the notable nuclear technologies are nuclear reactors, nuclear medicine and nuclear weapons. It is also used, among other things, in smoke detectors and gun sights. 

==History and scientific background==

=== Discovery ===

The vast majority of common, natural phenomena on Earth only involve gravity and electromagnetism, and not nuclear reactions. This is because atomic nuclei are generally kept apart because they contain positive electrical charges and therefore repel each other.

In 1896, Henri Becquerel was investigating phosphorescence in uranium salts when he discovered a new phenomenon which came to be called radioactivity. He, Pierre Curie and Marie Curie began investigating the phenomenon. In the process, they isolated the element radium, which is highly radioactive. They discovered that radioactive materials produce intense, penetrating rays of three distinct sorts, which they labeled alpha, beta, and gamma after the first three Greek letters. Some of these kinds of radiation could pass through ordinary matter, and all of them could be harmful in large amounts. All of the early researchers received various radiation burns, much like sunburn, and thought little of it.

The new phenomenon of radioactivity was seized upon by the manufacturers of quack medicine (as had the discoveries of electricity and magnetism, earlier), and a number of patent medicines and treatments involving radioactivity were put forward.

Gradually it was realized that the radiation produced by radioactive decay was ionizing radiation, and that even quantities too small to burn could pose a severe long-term hazard. Many of the scientists working on radioactivity died of cancer as a result of their exposure. Radioactive patent medicines mostly disappeared, but other applications of radioactive materials persisted, such as the use of radium salts to produce glowing dials on meters.

As the atom came to be better understood, the nature of radioactivity became clearer. Some larger atomic nuclei are unstable, and so decay (release matter or energy) after a random interval. The three forms of radiation that Becquerel and the Curies discovered are also more fully understood. Alpha decay is when a nucleus releases an alpha particle, which is two protons and two neutrons, equivalent to a helium nucleus. Beta decay is the release of a beta particle, a high-energy electron. Gamma decay releases gamma rays, which unlike alpha and beta radiation are not matter but electromagnetic radiation of very high frequency, and therefore energy. This type of radiation is the most dangerous and most difficult to block. All three types of radiation occur naturally in certain elements.

It has also become clear that the ultimate source of most terrestrial energy is nuclear, either through radiation from the Sun caused by stellar thermonuclear reactions or by radioactive decay of uranium within the Earth, the principal source of geothermal energy.

=== Nuclear fission ===

In natural nuclear radiation, the byproducts are very small compared to the nuclei from which they originate. Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a nucleus into roughly equal parts, and releasing energy and neutrons in the process. If these neutrons are captured by another unstable nucleus, they can fission as well, leading to a chain reaction. The average number of neutrons released per nucleus that go on to fission another nucleus is referred to as &quot;k&quot;. Values of &quot;k&quot; larger than 1 mean that the fission reaction is releasing more neutrons than it absorbs, and therefore is referred to as a self-sustaining chain reaction. A mass of fissile material large enough (and in a suitable configuration) to induce a self-sustaining chain reaction is called a critical mass.

When a neutron is captured by a suitable nucleus, fission may occur immediately, or the nucleus may persist in an unstable state for a short time. If there are enough immediate decays to carry on the chain reaction, the mass is said to be prompt critical, and the energy release will grow rapidly and uncontrollably, usually leading to an explosion.

When discovered on the eve of World War II, this insight led multiple countries to begin programs investigating the possibility of constructing an atomic bomb — a weapon which utilized fission reactions to generate far more energy than could be created with chemical explosives. The Manhattan Project, run by the United States with the help of the United Kingdom and Canada, developed multiple fission weapons which were used against Japan in 1945 at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. During the project, the first fission reactors were developed as well, though they were primarily for weapons manufacture and did not generate electricity.

In 1951, the first nuclear fission power plant was the first to produce electricity at the Experimental Breeder Reactor No. 1 (EBR-1), in Arco, Idaho, ushering in the &quot;Atomic Age&quot; of more intensive human energy use.

However, if the mass is critical only when the delayed neutrons are included, then the reaction can be controlled, for example by the introduction or removal of neutron absorbers. This is what allows nuclear reactors to be built. Fast neutrons are not easily captured by nuclei; they must be slowed (slow neutrons), generally by collision with the nuclei of a neutron moderator, before they can be easily captured. Today, this type of fission is commonly used to generate electricity.

=== Nuclear fusion ===
If nuclei are forced to collide, they can undergo nuclear fusion. This process may release or absorb energy. When the resulting nucleus is lighter than that of iron, energy is normally released; when the nucleus is heavier than that of iron, energy is generally absorbed. This process of fusion occurs in stars, which derive their energy from hydrogen and helium. They form, through stellar nucleosynthesis, the light elements (lithium to calcium) as well as some of the heavy elements (beyond iron and nickel, via the S-process). The remaining abundance of heavy elements, from nickel to uranium and beyond, is due to supernova nucleosynthesis, the R-process.

Of course, these natural processes of astrophysics are not examples of nuclear &quot;technology&quot;. Because of the very strong repulsion of nuclei, fusion is difficult to achieve in a controlled fashion. Hydrogen bombs obtain their enormous destructive power from fusion, but their energy cannot be controlled. Controlled fusion is achieved in particle accelerators; this is how many synthetic elements are produced. A fusor can also produce controlled fusion and is a useful neutron source. However, both of these devices operate at a net energy loss. Controlled, viable fusion power has proven elusive, despite the occasional hoax. Technical and theoretical difficulties have hindered the development of working civilian fusion technology, though research continues to this day around the world.

Nuclear fusion was initially pursued only in theoretical stages during World War II, when scientists on the Manhattan Project (led by Edward Teller) investigated it as a method to build a bomb. The project abandoned fusion after concluding that it would require a fission reaction to detonate. It took until 1952 for the first full hydrogen bomb to be detonated, so-called because it used reactions between deuterium and tritium. Fusion reactions are much more energetic per unit mass of fuel than fission reactions, but starting the fusion chain reaction is much more difficult.

== Nuclear weapons ==

A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission or a combination of fission and fusion. Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. Even small nuclear devices can devastate a city by blast, fire and radiation. Nuclear weapons are considered weapons of mass destruction, and their use and control has been a major aspect of international policy since their debut.

The design of a nuclear weapon is more complicated than it might seem. Such a weapon must hold one or more subcritical fissile masses stable for deployment, then induce criticality (create a critical mass) for detonation. It also is quite difficult to ensure that such a chain reaction consumes a significant fraction of the fuel before the device flies apart. The procurement of a nuclear fuel is also more difficult than it might seem, since sufficiently unstable substances for this process do not currently occur naturally on Earth in suitable amounts.

One isotope of uranium, namely uranium-235, is naturally occurring and sufficiently unstable, but it is always found mixed with the more stable isotope uranium-238. The latter accounts for more than 99% of the weight of natural uranium. Therefore, some method of isotope separation based on the weight of three neutrons must be performed to enrich (isolate) uranium-235.

Alternatively, the element plutonium possesses an isotope that is sufficiently unstable for this process to be usable. Terrestrial plutonium does not currently occur naturally in sufficient quantities for such use, so it must be manufactured in a nuclear reactor.

Ultimately, the Manhattan Project manufactured nuclear weapons based on each of these elements. They detonated the first nuclear weapon in a test code-named &quot;Trinity&quot;, near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945. The test was conducted to ensure that the implosion method of detonation would work, which it did. A uranium bomb, Little Boy, was dropped on the Japanese city Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed three days later by the plutonium-based Fat Man on Nagasaki. In the wake of unprecedented devastation and casualties from a single weapon, the Japanese government soon surrendered, ending World War II.

Since these bombings, no nuclear weapons have been deployed offensively. Nevertheless, they prompted an arms race to develop increasingly destructive bombs to provide a nuclear deterrent. Just over four years later, on August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its first fission weapon. The United Kingdom followed on October 2, 1952; France, on February 13, 1960; and China component to a nuclear weapon. Approximately half of the deaths from Hiroshima and Nagasaki died two to five years afterward from radiation exposure. A radiological weapon is a type of nuclear weapon designed to distribute hazardous nuclear material in enemy areas. Such a weapon would not have the explosive capability of a fission or fusion bomb, but would kill many people and contaminate a large area. A radiological weapon has never been deployed. While considered useless by a conventional military, such a weapon raises concerns over nuclear terrorism.

There have been over 2,000 nuclear tests conducted since 1945. In 1963, all nuclear and many non-nuclear states signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground nuclear testing. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, while China continued up until 1980. The last underground test by the United States was in 1992, the Soviet Union in 1990, the United Kingdom in 1991, and both France and China continued testing until 1996. After signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996 (which had as of 2011 not entered into force), all of these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing. Non-signatories India and Pakistan last tested nuclear weapons in 1998.

Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons known - the archetypal weapons of mass destruction. Throughout the Cold War, the opposing powers had huge nuclear arsenals, sufficient to kill hundreds of millions of people. Generations of people grew up under the shadow of nuclear devastation, portrayed in films such as &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot;.

However, the tremendous energy release in the detonation of a nuclear weapon also suggested the possibility of a new energy source.

== Civilian uses ==

===Nuclear power===

Nuclear power is a type of nuclear technology involving the controlled use of nuclear fission to release energy for work including propulsion, heat, and the generation of electricity. Nuclear energy is produced by a controlled nuclear chain reaction which creates heat—and which is used to boil water, produce steam, and drive a steam turbine. The turbine is used to generate electricity and/or to do mechanical work.

Currently nuclear power provides approximately 15.7% of the world&#x27;s electricity (in 2004) and is used to propel aircraft carriers, icebreakers and submarines (so far economics and fears in some ports have prevented the use of nuclear power in transport ships). All nuclear power plants use fission. No man-made fusion reaction has resulted in a viable source of electricity.

===Medical applications===

The medical applications of nuclear technology are divided into diagnostics and radiation treatment.

Imaging - The largest use of ionizing radiation in medicine is in medical radiography to make images of the inside of the human body using x-rays. This is the largest artificial source of radiation exposure for humans. Medical and dental x-ray imagers use of cobalt-60 or other x-ray sources. A number of radiopharmaceuticals are used, sometimes attached to organic molecules, to act as radioactive tracers or contrast agents in the human body. Positron emitting nucleotides are used for high resolution, short time span imaging in applications known as Positron emission tomography.

Radiation is also used to treat diseases in radiation therapy.

===Industrial applications===

Since some ionizing radiation can penetrate matter, they are used for a variety of measuring methods. X-rays and gamma rays are used in industrial radiography to make images of the inside of solid products, as a means of nondestructive testing and inspection. The piece to be radiographed is placed between the source and a photographic film in a cassette. After a certain exposure time, the film is developed and it shows any internal defects of the material.

Gauges - Gauges use the exponential absorption law of gamma rays
*Level indicators: Source and detector are placed at opposite sides of a container, indicating the presence or absence of material in the horizontal radiation path. Beta or gamma sources are used, depending on the thickness and the density of the material to be measured. The method is used for containers of liquids or of grainy substances
*Thickness gauges: if the material is of constant density, the signal measured by the radiation detector depends on the thickness of the material. This is useful for continuous production, like of paper, rubber, etc.

Electrostatic control - To avoid the build-up of static electricity in production of paper, plastics, synthetic textiles, etc., a ribbon-shaped source of the alpha emitter 241Am can be placed close to the material at the end of the production line. The source ionizes the air to remove electric charges on the material.

Radioactive tracers - Since radioactive isotopes behave, chemically, mostly like the inactive element, the behavior of a certain chemical substance can be followed by &quot;tracing&quot; the radioactivity. Examples:
*Adding a gamma tracer to a gas or liquid in a closed system makes it possible to find a hole in a tube.
*Adding a tracer to the surface of the component of a motor makes it possible to measure wear by measuring the activity of the lubricating oil.

Oil and Gas Exploration- Nuclear well logging is used to help predict the commercial viability of new or existing wells. The technology involves the use of a neutron or gamma-ray source and a radiation detector which are lowered into boreholes to determine the properties of the surrounding rock such as porosity and lithography.

Road Construction - Nuclear moisture/density gauges are used to determine the density of soils, asphalt, and concrete. Typically a cesium-137 source is used.

===Commercial applications===
*radioluminescence
*tritium illumination: Tritium is used with phosphor in rifle sights to increase nighttime firing accuracy. Some runway markers and building exit signs use the same technology, to remain illuminated during blackouts.
*Betavoltaics.
*Smoke detector: An ionization smoke detector includes a tiny mass of radioactive americium-241, which is a source of alpha radiation. Two ionisation chambers are placed next to each other. Both contain a small source of 241Am that gives rise to a small constant current. One is closed and serves for comparison, the other is open to ambient air; it has a gridded electrode. When smoke enters the open chamber, the current is disrupted as the smoke particles attach to the charged ions and restore them to a neutral electrical state. This reduces the current in the open chamber. When the current drops below a certain threshold, the alarm is triggered.

===Food processing and agriculture===

In biology and agriculture, radiation is used to induce mutations to produce new or improved species, such as in atomic gardening. Another use in insect control is the sterile insect technique, where male insects are sterilized by radiation and released, so they have no offspring, to reduce the population.

In industrial and food applications, radiation is used for sterilization of tools and equipment. An advantage is that the object may be sealed in plastic before sterilization. An emerging use in food production is the sterilization of food using food irradiation.
Food irradiation is the process of exposing food to ionizing radiation in order to destroy microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, or insects that might be present in the food. The radiation sources used include radioisotope gamma ray sources, X-ray generators and electron accelerators. Further applications include sprout inhibition, delay of ripening, increase of juice yield, and improvement of re-hydration. Irradiation is a more general term of deliberate exposure of materials to radiation to achieve a technical goal (in this context &#x27;ionizing radiation&#x27; is implied). As such it is also used on non-food items, such as medical hardware, plastics, tubes for gas-pipelines, hoses for floor-heating, shrink-foils for food packaging, automobile parts, wires and cables (isolation), tires, and even gemstones. Compared to the amount of food irradiated, the volume of those every-day applications is huge but not noticed by the consumer.

The genuine effect of processing food by ionizing radiation relates to damages to the DNA, the basic genetic information for life. Microorganisms can no longer proliferate and continue their malignant or pathogenic activities. Spoilage causing micro-organisms cannot continue their activities. Insects do not survive or become incapable of procreation. Plants cannot continue the natural ripening or aging process. All these effects are beneficial to the consumer and the food industry, likewise.

The amount of energy imparted for effective food irradiation is low compared to cooking the same; even at a typical dose of 10 kGy most food, which is (with regard to warming) physically equivalent to water, would warm by only about 2.5 °C (4.5 °F).

The specialty of processing food by ionizing radiation is the fact, that the energy density per atomic transition is very high, it can cleave molecules and induce ionization (hence the name) which cannot be achieved by mere heating. This is the reason for new beneficial effects, however at the same time, for new concerns. The treatment of solid food by ionizing radiation can provide an effect similar to heat pasteurization of liquids, such as milk. However, the use of the term, cold pasteurization, to describe irradiated foods is controversial, because pasteurization and irradiation are fundamentally different processes, although the intended end results can in some cases be similar.

Detractors of food irradiation have concerns about the health hazards of induced radioactivity. A report for the industry advocacy group American Council on Science and Health entitled &quot;Irradiated Foods&quot; states: &quot;The types of radiation sources approved for the treatment of foods have specific energy levels well below that which would cause any element in food to become radioactive. Food undergoing irradiation does not become any more radioactive than luggage passing through an airport X-ray scanner or teeth that have been X-rayed.&quot;

Food irradiation is currently permitted by over 40 countries and volumes are estimated to exceed annually worldwide.

Food irradiation is essentially a non-nuclear technology; it relies on the use of ionizing radiation which may be generated by accelerators for electrons and conversion into bremsstrahlung, but which may use also gamma-rays from nuclear decay. There is a worldwide industry for processing by ionizing radiation, the majority by number and by processing power using accelerators. Food irradiation is only a niche application compared to medical supplies, plastic materials, raw materials, gemstones, cables and wires, etc.

== Accidents ==
Nuclear accidents, because of the powerful forces involved, are often very dangerous. Historically, the first incidents involved fatal radiation exposure. Marie Curie died from aplastic anemia which resulted from her high levels of exposure. Two scientists, an American and Canadian respectively, Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin, died after mishandling the same plutonium mass. Unlike conventional weapons, the intense light, heat, and explosive force is not the only deadly component to a nuclear weapon. Approximately half of the deaths from Hiroshima and Nagasaki died two to five years afterward from radiation exposure.

Civilian nuclear and radiological accidents primarily involve nuclear power plants. Most common are nuclear leaks that expose workers to hazardous material. A nuclear meltdown refers to the more serious hazard of releasing nuclear material into the surrounding environment. The most significant meltdowns occurred at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and Chernobyl in the Soviet Ukraine. The earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 caused serious damage to three nuclear reactors and a spent fuel storage pond at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. Military reactors that experienced similar accidents were Windscale in the United Kingdom and SL-1 in the United States.

Military accidents usually involve the loss or unexpected detonation of nuclear weapons. The Castle Bravo test in 1954 produced a larger yield than expected, which contaminated nearby islands, a Japanese fishing boat (with one fatality), and raised concerns about contaminated fish in Japan. In the 1950s through 1970s, several nuclear bombs were lost from submarines and aircraft, some of which have never been recovered. The last twenty years have seen a marked decline in such accidents.

== Examples of environmental benefits ==

Proponents of nuclear energy note that annually, nuclear-generated electricity reduces 470 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise come from fossil fuels. Additionally, the amount of comparatively low waste that nuclear energy does create is safely disposed of by the large scale nuclear energy production facilities or it is repurposed/recycled for other energy uses. Proponents of nuclear energy also bring to attention the opportunity cost of utilizing other forms of electricity. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that coal kills 30,000 people a year, as a result of its environmental impact, while 60 people died in the Chernobyl disaster. A real world example of impact provided by proponents of nuclear energy is the 650,000 ton increase in carbon emissions in the two months following the closure of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant.

<text>The Melbourne Football Club, nicknamed the Demons or colloquially the Dees, is a professional Australian rules football club based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It competes in the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport&#x27;s premier competition and plays its home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).

Melbourne is the world&#x27;s oldest professional club of any football code. Its origins can be traced to an 1858 letter in which Tom Wills, captain of the Victoria cricket team, called for the formation of a &quot;foot-ball club&quot; with its own &quot;code of laws&quot;. An informal Melbourne team played that winter and officially formed in May 1859, when Wills and three other members codified &quot;The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club&quot;—the basis of Australian rules football. The club was a dominant force in the early years of the game and a foundation member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and the Victorian Football League (VFL) in 1896, now the national AFL. Melbourne has won 13 VFL/AFL premierships, the latest in 2021. The club was a foundation team of the AFL Women&#x27;s league (AFLW), and won its first AFLW premiership in 2022 season 7.

The football club has been a sporting section of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) since 2009, having previously been associated with the MCC between 1889 and 1980.

==History==

===1858: Foundations===
In the winter and spring of 1858, a loosely organised football team known as &#x27;Melbourne&#x27; played in a series of scratch matches in the parklands outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground. This team was captained by Tom Wills, a prominent athlete and captain of the Victoria cricket team, who, on 10 July that year, had of his published by the Melbourne-based &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in Victoria and Sporting Chronicle&quot;, in which he calls for the formation of a &quot;foot-ball club&quot; with a &quot;code of laws&quot; to keep cricketers fit during winter. Other figures associated with this embryonic Melbourne side included Melbourne Cricket Club members Jerry Bryant, William Hammersley and J. B. Thompson, and teacher Thomas H. Smith.

It is possible that the first game played involving the Melbourne team took place on or adjacent to the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 August following Bryant&#x27;s call for &#x27;all good kicks&#x27; to take part with a subsequent match held among the Melbourne Cricket Club members on 30 August. On 25 September, Melbourne was challenged to a match by the South Yarra Football Club featuring 26 players a side, with Melbourne winning the game. Although the club had not yet been established as a formal entity, the year 1858 has long been recognised as being the foundation year of the Melbourne Football Club and for Australian rules football.

===1859–1876: establishment and early years===
With the cricket season finished &quot;The Argus&quot; reported in early May 1859 that the membership of the &quot;Melbourne Football Club&quot; was growing &#x27;owing, probably, to its being no longer confined to members of the Melbourne Cricket Club&#x27;. On 14 May the club held its first match of the year in the Richmond Paddock with two sides captained by Smith and Bryant, with Bryant&#x27;s side kicking two goals for victory. A subsequent meeting was held to elect a Secretary, Treasurer and committee of five to administer the affairs of the club and to draft its rules, whilst an application to the MCC was made for use of the MCG on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Although most Melbourne players and officials were associated with the MCC, the football club was not initially allowed to use its ground, so matches were played on the fields at Yarra Park.
On 17 and 21 May 1859, Wills, Hammersley, Thompson and Smith met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, to draft &quot;The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club&quot;. The resulting ten codified rules are the laws from which Australian rules football evolved.

In the early years of the club, football matches were conducted on a casual basis with no set fixture and teams often having to cancel engagements due to a lack of players. The first mention of an interclub match played under the new code was between Melbourne and South Yarra in July 1859, with Hammersley as Melbourne&#x27;s inaugural captain. In 1860 Melbourne played its first match against the Geelong Football Club in Geelong with the match resulting in a draw.

In 1861, Melbourne participated in the Caledonian Society Challenge Cup, but lost the trophy to the Melbourne University Football Club. The club pushed for its rules to be the accepted rules, however many of the early suburban matches were played under compromised rules decided between the captains of the competing teams.
By 1866 several other clubs had also adopted an updated version of Melbourne&#x27;s rules, drafted at a meeting chaired by Wills&#x27; cousin, H. C. A. Harrison. Harrison was a key figure in the early years of the club; he often served as captain and, in later years, as president. Due to his popular reputation and administrative efforts, he was officially named &quot;Father of Australian Football&quot; in 1908, the year of the sport&#x27;s golden jubilee.

During the 1870s, Melbourne fielded teams in the Seven Twenties and South Yarra Cup competitions.

===1877–1896: Victorian Football Association===

In 1877, Melbourne became a founding member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA). During the same year the club took part in the first interstate football match involving a South Australian side, , defeating the home side 1–0. Melbourne never won a VFA premiership, although they were consistently one of the stronger teams in the competition, finishing as runners-up four times, to Carlton in 1877, Geelong in 1878 and twice to Essendon in 1893 and 1894.

In 1884 Melbourne&#x27;s stand at the MCG which catered for 3,000 spectators burned down precipitating a series of financial constraints for the club. With mounting debts, club officials running up unauthorised accounts, poor on-field form and players leaving to join other clubs, Melbourne&#x27;s future was in serious jeopardy by 1888. It was proposed that the MCC intervene to provide assistance given the closeness of the two clubs and the fact that football matches generated significant gate revenue for the MCC.

At the end of the 1889 season, the MFC and MCC committees met and agreed to amalgamation of the two. The football club would become a section of the cricket club with the MCC handling the MFC&#x27;s immediate and ongoing financial concerns. Melbourne&#x27;s on-field prospects soon lifted finishing fourth on the ladder in 1892 and vying the Premiership in 1893. This was to be the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership that produced 12 VFL Premierships between 1900 and 1964.

===1897–1932: early years in the Victorian Football League===
In 1897, Melbourne joined other VFA powerhouse clubs Essendon, Collingwood, Fitzroy, Geelong, and South Melbourne to form the breakaway Victorian Football League with Carlton and St Kilda also joining. In the first season of the new competition, Jack Leith was the league&#x27;s leading goalscorer while Fred McGinis emerged as a champion player and league identity being judged Champion of the Colony for the season. In 1900, McGinis helped take Melbourne to its first VFL premiership, defeating Fitzroy in a Grand Final upset at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground; and, in 1904, Vin Coutie kicked 39 goals to be the League&#x27;s leading goalkicker. But, despite this success, including playing in the finals again in 1902, Melbourne&#x27;s first decade of the 20th century was poor on-field, with the club taking out the Wooden Spoon in 1905 and 1906.

In the 1910s the team had adopted the nickname &#x27;Fuchsias&#x27; alongside the pre-existing Redlegs name and in 1912 the club adopted a club song to the tune of &#x27;You&#x27;re A Grand Old Flag&quot;. Harry Brereton was the VFL leading goalscorer in the 1911 and 1912 season. During this time the club took pride in its policy of amateurism and when World War I broke out, the club strongly petitioned for the league being suspended to prevent fit professional footballers from joining the war effort. In 1916 the club refused to take part in the competition for three seasons, returning in 1919. 14 Melbourne players lost their lives in the conflict, including Arthur Mueller &#x27;Joe&#x27; Pearce, Clifford Burge, Jack Doubleday, Desmond McDonald, Ralph Robertson, Percy Rodriguez and Alfred Williamson. For instance, in May 1919, an unidentified former Melbourne footballer, wrote to the football correspondent of &quot;The Argus&quot; as follows:
::&quot;In 1914 the Melbourne football team, after its junction with the University, was a fine team, and succeeded in reaching the semi-finals.Out of this combination the following players enlisted and served at the front:—C. Lilley (seriously wounded), J. Hassett, H. Tomkins (severely wounded), J. Evans (seriously wounded), W. Hendrie, R. L. Park, J. Doubleday (died), A. Best, C. Burge (killed), C. (viz., A.) Williamson (killed), J. Brake, R. Lowell, E. Parsons (seriously wounded), A. M. Pearce (killed), F. Lugton (killed), A. George, C. Armstrong, P. Rodriguez (killed), J. Cannole (viz., Connole), A. Fraser (seriously wounded), T. Collins.These are all players of note, and in themselves would have formed a very fine side, but there is only one of them playing at the present time, viz., C. Lilley, who, as a matter of fact, takes the field under some disability owing to severe wounds which he received on service.&quot; — &quot;The Argus&quot;, 16 May 1919.

Melbourne had little success in the immediate post-war years having not played a final since 1915, taking out another Wooden Spoon in 1919. However, finals form would return with the team defeating Geelong and later losing to Collingwood in 1925. In 1926 Albert Chadwick captain-coached the team to its second league Premiership defeating Collingwood in the Grand Final. Melbourne&#x27;s greatest player at this time was Ivor Warne-Smith, who in the Premiership year won the club&#x27;s first Brownlow Medal. Warne-Smith went on to win a second Brownlow in 1928, a year in which Melbourne would play finals again. Chadwick and Warne-Smith would both go on to have influential administrative roles in the club&#x27;s most successful period in the 1950s.

===1933–1964: dominant years ===
The Great Depression took a financial toll on the club with poor on-field performances and some players having the pressure of having to search for employment. Melbourne&#x27;s fortunes were lifted however for the 1933 season when it lured Richmond&#x27;s premiership winning coach Frank &quot;Checker&quot; Hughes and Richmond&#x27;s secretary Percy Page to the club.

Hughes was a tough and disciplined coach inspiring the changing of the club&#x27;s nickname from the Fuchsias to the Demons. 

Under Hughes&#x27; leadership, and with star players including captain Allan La Fontaine, rover Percy Beames, backman Jack Mueller and Norm Smith at full forward, the Demons played finals in 1936 and 1937, and became the third club after Carlton and Collingwood to win three successive premierships in 1939, 1940 and 1941.

Tragedy would fall on the club soon after with 11 players giving their lives whilst serving in World War 2. These players included premiership players Keith &#x27;Bluey&#x27; Truscott, Harold Ball, Syd Anderson and Ron Barassi Sr, all for whom club awards have been dedicated to, with the club&#x27;s Best and Fairest award named in honour of Truscott.

Hughes left the club at the end of the 1941 season but returned in 1945. The next year Don Cordner became the second Demon to win the Brownlow Medal with Melbourne reaching the grand final, losing to Essendon by a margin of 63 points. Fred Fanning was the VFL leading goal scorer in 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1947 when he also kicked the league record 18 goals in a match during the last game of the season (a record that still stands). In 1948, Melbourne met Essendon in a grand final rematch. The Bombers&#x27; inaccurate kicking of 7 goals and 27 behinds resulted in the first ever drawn VFL grand final. The Demons returned the next week to win its sixth premiership with Jack Mueller kicking six goals in the match. Hughes retired again as coach at the end of the season and after being denied the position by a single vote of the club&#x27;s committee, Norm Smith moved to Fitzroy to take a position as captain-coach.
New coach Allan La Fontaine had limited success despite the Demons playing finals in 1950 and bringing talented new players into the club. After the Demons took out the Wooden Spoon in 1951, Smith returned to take up the coaching position in the 1952 season and set about forging a new team with future club champion Ron Barassi joining in 1953 under the newly created father-son rule. In 1954, the Demons made the Grand Final losing to a rampaging Footscray. In 1955 the Demons cemented their position as the best team in the league finishing top of the ladder and taking out the Premiership in the Grand Final against Collingwood. Melbourne became the only VFL team to win three premierships in succession twice by winning the 1956 and 1957 grand finals against Collingwood and Essendon. The Demons suffered a shock defeat to their rivals Collingwood in the 1958 grand final, but would regain the premiership following wins in the 1959 and 1960 grand finals against Essendon and Collingwood. Between 1955 and 1960, Melbourne finished top of the ladder in every season, winning five premierships. Had the Demons not been defeated in 1958, they may have won seven premierships in a row.

Despite playing in the finals series in 1961, 1962 and 1963, Melbourne failed to reach a grand final until 1964 when the Demons finished top of the ladder again. In one of the most thrilling grand finals, Melbourne won its 12th VFL premiership in the dying seconds of the game against Collingwood with back-pocket player Neil Crompton kicking the winning goal.

After the 1954 Grand Final loss to Footscray, no team was able to score 100 points against the Demons until Collingwood in round 5 1963. The next team was Geelong with 110 in round 1 1964. and dominant period of any team in the VFL/AFL no other team has ever won 10 premierships in just 31 years.

===1965–1986: decades of disappointment===
In one of the greatest shock moves in the VFL history, Ron Barassi transferred to Carlton as captain-coach for the 1965 season. Despite this, Melbourne were still the dominant team of the league, winning its first eight games in succession. After having lost just three games, the club&#x27;s committee made the startling decision to sack Norm Smith as coach before its Round 13 fixture against North Melbourne. Hughes returned to coach the Demons in a losing game, while Melbourne identities, including Barassi took to the media to defend Smith. Smith was reinstated however the damage was done, the Demons would only win one more game and subsequently missed out on finals for the first time since 1953. Melbourne would not play in another finals series until 1987.

Smith coached two more seasons with Melbourne and a succession of coaches followed trying to reverse the Demons fortunes including John Beckwith (1968–70), Ian Ridley (1971–73), Bob Skilton (1974–77) and Dennis Jones (1978). Melbourne languished near the bottom of the ladder throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, including three wooden spoons in 1969, 1974 and 1978. Despite possessing gifted players including Robert Flower and Greg Wells, the introduction of country zoning and poor management hampered the club&#x27;s fortunes. Melbourne tried to supplement its list by recruiting older players from successful teams including Carl Diterich who played in two separate engagements with the Demons, the first between 1973 and 1975 and then serving as captain-coach in 1979 and 1980.

Melbourne&#x27;s best start to a season was in 1971 when the club was at the top of the ladder after the first round and maintained that position until it lost to Collingwood in round 6. Melbourne was still in second place at the start of the second half of the season but a dramatic slump had them dropping to fifth position five weeks later. They finished with only two more wins and a draw.

In 1976, Melbourne missed what looked to be an almost certain finals appearance. In the final round, the Demons only needed to beat bottom side Collingwood, and for Footscray to lose to the top side Carlton. The Demons beat Collingwood at Victoria Park but an unexpected drawn match between Footscray and Carlton saw the Bulldogs edge out the Demons for the finals. Melbourne would then fall back into the bottom quarter of the ladder the following season, and in 1979 they suffered the worst defeat in VFL/AFL history, losing to by 190 points in round 17, although they would beat Essendon the following week.
In an effort to attract more members and to improve the club&#x27;s finances the club legally separated from the MCC, becoming a public company. In 1981, under the chairmanship of Sir Billy Snedden, and with a public campaign backed by radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch, Ron Barassi returned to Melbourne as coach and immediately appointed Robert Flower as captain. When he left the Demons in 1965 it was felt Barassi would eventually return and his arrival caused much excitement and an expectation of immediate success. Barassi set about implementing a 5-year plan for the Demons to win a Premiership, however the Demons finished 1981 with the wooden spoon after winning only one game. Recruits Brian Wilson from Footscray and Peter Moore from Collingwood would win the club&#x27;s 4th and 5th Brownlow Medals in 1982 and 1984. However, despite sound recruiting, Barassi was unable to take the Demons to an elusive finals series and John Northey took up the coaching position in 1986.

===1987–2006: rollercoaster years===
Melbourne would finally make the finals in 1987 in dramatic fashion needing to beat Footscray at the Western Oval and requiring Geelong to lose to Hawthorn. The Demons beat the Bulldogs by two goals with the Hawks beating the Cats by three points in the dying seconds of the game. Both matches took place at the same time, with the Melbourne fans cheering towards the end of the game when news came through of the Hawks win. Melbourne cruised into the Preliminary Final defeating North Melbourne by 118 points and Sydney by 76 points. In Robert Flower&#x27;s last game, the Demons lead the Hawks by 4 points at the final siren, though Hawthorn&#x27;s Gary Buckenara had a free kick 55 metres out. But Melbourne Irish recruit Jim Stynes ran across the mark and incurred a 15-metre penalty, bringing Buckenara close enough to kick the winning goal after the siren. The Demons would try to exact revenge on the Hawks in the 1988 Grand Final but were trounced by 96 points.

From 1987 to 1991, Melbourne had five positive win–loss differentials in successive seasons which the club had not been able to achieve since the 1950s. Thereafter things went downhill for Northey, although Jim Stynes won the Brownlow in 1991. In 1992, the club finished 11th, and Northey was replaced by Neil Balme as coach. Balme coached Melbourne into the finals in 1994, but a last game loss to Brisbane saw them drop out of the top-eight in 1995, and the club lingered at or near the bottom of the ladder for most of the 1996 season.

By 1996, the club was also in dire financial straits. The club&#x27;s board led by past club champion Ian Ridley as president decided on the desperate step of a merger with Hawthorn. In the ensuing weeks, a passionate debate was fought between pro and anti-merger supporters. In the first few days of this debate, lifelong supporters Mark and Anthony Jenkins met with coterie member George Zagon to form the Demon Alternative – an anti-merger group that was to significantly impact on the plans of the incumbent board. Former player and politician Brian Dixon and Rabbi Joseph Gutnick became the prominent leaders of the Demon Alternative group. The group quickly organised itself into a credible option for Melbourne supporters; however given the support of the AFL and other factors, when the merger issue was put to a vote, a majority of Melbourne members supported the board. In a meeting on the opposite side of town, Hawthorn members rejected their board&#x27;s proposal and eventually the merger was defeated.

Gutnick and Mark Jenkins were co-opted onto the club&#x27;s board in the aftermath with Gutnick later being voted in as president. He put $3 million of his own money into the club, and sacked Balme as coach midway through the 1997 season. In 1998, under new coach Neale Daniher, the club spent most of the season in the top eight and beat the eventual premiers Adelaide in the Qualifying Final. Melbourne also eliminated St Kilda, but lost to North Melbourne in the Preliminary Final. In 1999 Melbourne finished in the bottom three.

In an exciting finish to the 2000 season, Melbourne stormed its way into the Grand Final, but were convincingly beaten by ladder leaders Essendon. Melbourne missed out on finals in 2001 finishing 11th, but would finish sixth in 2002 to eventually lose its semi-final to Adelaide at the MCG in a controversial ‘away’ game, only played in Melbourne due to the AFL&#x27;s contractual obligations with the MCG. Captain David Neitz would play his best season winning the Best and Fairest award and winning the club&#x27;s first Coleman Medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalscorer kicking 75 goals. Gutnick was replaced by Gabriel Szondy as president at the end of the year winning 65% of the members&#x27; vote.

In 2003, Melbourne plunged into new on and off-field crises, winning only five games for the year and posting a $1 million loss. Szondy resigned as president and it seemed that Daniher&#x27;s tenure as coach was under threat. Melbourne played finals again in 2004. In a seesawing Elimination Final, the Demons lost to Essendon by less than a goal. During the 2004 post-season, Melbourne player Troy Broadbridge was killed in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, when he was swept off Phi Phi island in Thailand. His body was found on 3 January 2005, and brought home. A funeral was held on 20 January 2005 in recognition to the No. 20 guernsey he wore during his playing days. During the 2005 off-season, the whole team travelled to the island in which Broadbridge was killed to build a new school for those struck by the tsunami. The No.20 jumper was then rested for two years.

Melbourne finished the 2005 season in seventh position but lost the elimination final to Geelong by 55 points. In 2006, after a slow start, Melbourne again finished the season in seventh position. After defeating St Kilda in the second Elimination Final by 18 points the season ended the following week when Fremantle beat the Demons by 28 points. Daniher had become the club&#x27;s the second longest-serving coach while Neitz became Melbourne&#x27;s all-time leading goal-kicker on 19 May, surpassing Norm Smith&#x27;s previous record of 546 goals. Two weeks later, he broke Robert Flower&#x27;s long standing record of 272 games, making him the longest serving Demon in history.

===2007–2017: years of struggle===
At the start of the 2007 AFL season, Melbourne were thought by many pundits to be contenders for the Premiership, but injuries to key players across the team resulted in the Demons losing its opening nine matches. Daniher resigned as coach mid-season with Mark Riley appointed as caretaker coach. Late in the season, David Neitz became the first Melbourne player to play 300 games.
Dean Bailey was appointed coach for the 2008 season, however Melbourne lost their first six matches, before breaking through with a record comeback win in round seven against Fremantle. Melbourne finished the season poorly finishing last on the ladder, taking out its first Wooden Spoon since 1997.

Off field, the club remained in turmoil. In its 150th anniversary year club CEO Steve Harris resigned and was replaced by former Wimbledon tennis champion Paul McNamee in early 2008. Club President Paul Gardner also resigned mid-season making way for former club champion Jim Stynes who inherited a $4.5 million debt. Stynes immediately got to work and was instrumental in Melbourne&#x27;s ‘Debt Demolition’ campaign held in a Kensington warehouse on 5 August. More than $1.3 million was raised on the night, with more than $3 million pledged to the cause. The Stynes&#x27; board sacked McNamee after just four months following criticism of him holidaying in Wimbledon to compete in a legends match. New club CEO Cameron Schwab declared that it required urgent AFL assistance to continue, requesting additional funding to its special annual distribution. In December, a fallout in negotiations between the Melbourne Cricket Club resulted in the MCC not committing an expected $2 million to the club and Schwab declared that the club&#x27;s immediate future was in doubt. This doubt was quickly put to bed when the AFL and MCC finalised negotiations. The AFL committed $1 million to the club in 2009, with the MCC matching the AFL contribution.

Melbourne endured another poor season in 2009, winning just four matches to claim back-to-back Wooden Spoons. The year was made worse in July when Jim Stynes revealed he was fighting cancer. He temporarily stood down, with vice-chairman Don McLardy stepping up in his absence. In 2010 the club&#x27;s on-field fortunes lifted, as they finished the season 12th on the ladder.

The club&#x27;s 2011 season took a dramatic turn when the Demons suffered its second greatest loss in league history, going down to Geelong at Kardinia Park in round 19 by 186 points. Bailey was immediately sacked as coach with former club captain Todd Viney coaching the remaining games to finish 13th on the ladder. In August the club announced that its goal of wiping out the club&#x27;s debt had finally been achieved and new coach Mark Neeld was announced in September.

In 2012 Jim Stynes retired as president, with vice-president Don McLardy stepping up to take the reins. Tragically, on March 20, Stynes’ long fight with cancer came to an end. He was given a state funeral, given his remarkable legacy on and off the field. The AFL investigated Melbourne&#x27;s 2009 season in August, following comments made by former Demon and Carlton player, Brock McLean, that the club had not been trying to win. See: &quot;Melbourne Football Club tanking scandal&quot;

In 2013, Melbourne managed just one win from its first 11 games and Neeld was sacked as coach in Round 17 with assistant coach Neil Craig being appointed caretaker. This was precipitated by the departures of CEO Schwab and President McLardy. In September the club announced Sydney premiership coach Paul Roos signed a two-year deal to coach the Demons, with the option of a third year.

Paul Roos&#x27; first year in his tenure as the Demons&#x27; coach saw an improvement from their 2013 season, with the Demons doubling their win tally. Under Roos, the club continued to steadily improve winning 7 games in 2015 and key forward Jesse Hogan won Melbourne&#x27;s second AFL Rising Star award. Roos left Melbourne after another improved season in 2016 with assistant coach Simon Goodwin taking over in a planned succession.

Melbourne finished the 2017 season in ninth place with a win–loss record of 12–10, missing out on eighth spot to West Coast by 0.5%.

Melbourne made history in 2017, competing as one of the eight foundation clubs in the inaugural AFL Women&#x27;s competition. Led by captain Daisy Pearce and coach Mick Stinear, Melbourne took on the Brisbane Lions in the first game of the new league at Casey Fields.

At the end of the 2018 season Melbourne finished in fifth place on the ladder reaching the finals series for the first time since 2006. The Demons advanced to an eventual Preliminary final defeat to West Coast after defeating Geelong and Hawthorn. Melbourne&#x27;s success could not be maintained in 2019 with the Demons finishing 17th on the ladder. In the shortened 2020 season interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Melbourne would finish ninth on the Ladder winning nine and losing eight games.

=== 2021: premiership success after 57 years ===
Melbourne&#x27;s victory over North Melbourne in Round 7 of the 2021 season put them on the top of the ladder for the first time since the third round of 2005. They won their first nine matches of a season for the first time since 1956. Melbourne&#x27;s win over West Coast in Round 21 put them at the top of the ladder again and secured their first double chance in a finals series since the 2000 season. Their next win against Adelaide equalled their most wins in a season from 1956. With captain Max Gawn kicking a goal after the siren in the Round 23 match against Geelong, Melbourne finished the season as minor premiers for the first time since 1964. After defeating Brisbane in a qualifying final at the Adelaide Oval and Geelong in a preliminary final at Optus Stadium, the Demons reached their first grand final since 2000. On 25 September, Melbourne won its 13th VFL/AFL premiership, defeating the Western Bulldogs by 74 points in the grand final at Optus Stadium in Perth; it was their first premiership since their 1964 victory against Collingwood. Christian Petracca was unanimously judged as best on the ground, winning the club&#x27;s first Norm Smith Medal.
=== 2022–present ===

Melbourne&#x27;s premiership defence began with 10 straight victories, increasing their streak from last year to 17, before suffering three losses on the bounce to fellow finalists Fremantle, Sydney and Collingwood. The Demons’ form in the second half of the 2022 season was inconsistent, but the reigning premiers emphatically secured a spot in the top four after a comfortable 58-point victory over Brisbane in the final round. The Demons finished second with a win–loss record of 16 wins and six losses, but came undone in the finals, bowing out in straight sets after losing to Sydney and Brisbane in the qualifying and semi final respectively.

The 2023 season for Melbourne was widely similar to its predecessor, going on frequent winning streaks and suffering sporadic losses to record 16 wins and seven losses for a fourth-placed finish. Their season ended in week two of the finals, losing to Collingwood and Carlton in the qualifying and semi final respectively, becoming the first team to suffer consecutive straight sets exits in two seasons under the current AFL finals system. 

The 2024 AFL season saw Melbourne miss finals for the first time since 2020, with the club finishing 14th with a total of 11 wins and 12 losses. Despite spending large periods of the season within the top eight, Melbourne lost 5 of their last 6 matches to drop out of finals calculations. The year was compounded by a myriad of off-field issues including a season ending injury to Christian Petracca during the annual King&#x27;s Birthday match after he was kneed in the ribs late in the first quarter by Collingwood captain Darcy Moore.

==Club symbols==

=== Colours ===
In one of the first practice matches between Melbourne teammates in 1859, both red and blue were worn and these colours quickly became associated with the Melbourne Football Club, although they were not used as part of the team&#x27;s uniform.

In 1872, club member Larry Bell brought some red stockings back from England which were teemed with blue knickerbockers and jerseys and red caps. It is at this time that the team became known as the &#x27;Redlegs&#x27;. Bell also brought back with him blue stockings which were reputedly given to the Carlton Football Club.

=== Uniform ===
In the early days of Australian football, players would wear whatever sporting clothing they had. As most of its players were members of the Melbourne Cricket Club, it quickly became the trend for Melbourne players to wear predominantly white clothes, which gave rise to the team being called the &#x27;Invincible Whites&#x27;. For a brief period in 1861 and 1862, the club adopted magenta flannel shirts, but these were soon abandoned.

From 1872, a more standardised uniform was adopted, although it remained common for footballers to wear a mismatch of uniforms. Most footballers had dispensed with wearing cricket whites and were now choosing to wear woollen navy guernseys which were more suitable for winter play. The Melbourne team distinguished itself with red socks and a red cap. A canvas lace up guernsey was introduced in 1884 which featured a red leather strip down the middle and was worn by players up until 1915. In 1906, some players wore a navy woollen guernsey with a small red yoke around the neck. When Melbourne re-entered the competition for the 1919 season, a standardised uniform was used with a red V on a navy jumper. In 1925, the V was made smaller and raised to the collar with a red horizontal band added to the waist.

The current club jumper of a red V-shaped yoke on a navy background was first adopted in 1935, and apart from very slight variations over the years, and a period in which royal blue was used between 1975 and 1986 due to the introduction of colour television, the jumper has remained the same.

The Melbourne clash strip, new in 2018, consists of a retro-inspired home strip of royal blue with a red yoke, including white shorts as worn between 1975 and 1986. The alternate away strip is the same as the home strip, with the difference being the back entirely in red to allow the club to wear a non-white alternate strip.

New Balance have manufactured Melbourne&#x27;s on- and off-field apparel since 2011.

====Uniform evolution====
Throughout its history, Melbourne has had different guernsey designs, as follows:

===Mascot===

In 1933, Melbourne was beginning to rebuild its side and abandoned the name &#x27;Fuchsias&#x27; for a more ferocious title—the &#x27;Demons&#x27;. This was inspired by then coach Frank &quot;Checker&quot; Hughes reportedly saying to the players in a game to &#x27;lift up your heads and play like demons!&#x27;. Over the years, the club has used various iterations of demons as club mascots. This includes Ronald Deeman from the AFL Mascot Manor franchise.
The current club mascots are Chuck, Checker, and Cheeky. Chuck is named after legendary coach Frank &quot;Checker&quot; Hughes; Daisy is named after the inaugural captain of the women&#x27;s team, Daisy Pearce; and Flash is named after the 2009 Keith &quot;Bluey&quot; Truscott Medallist, Aaron Davey.

===Song===
The official Melbourne Football Club song is called &quot;It&#x27;s a Grand Old Flag&quot; (sung to the tune of George M. Cohan&#x27;s 1906 song &quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot;). The song was first adopted by the club in 1912. The Demons primarily repeat the first verse of the song.

&quot;It&#x27;s a grand old flag, it’s a high-flying flag&quot;,

&quot;It’s the emblem for me and for you;&quot;

&quot;It’s the emblem of the team we love,&quot;

&quot;The team of the Red and the Blue.&quot;

&quot;Every heart beats true for the Red and the Blue,&quot;

&quot;And we sing this song to you:&quot;

&quot;Should old acquaintance be forgot,&quot;

&quot;Keep your eye on the Red and the Blue.&quot;

A second verse was reputedly written by club champion Keith &quot;Bluey&quot; Truscott in 1940, referencing the club&#x27;s 1939 and 1926 VFL premiership titles. The club resurrected the original second verse for the 2011 season.

&quot;Oh, the team played fine in the year Thirty-nine,&quot;

&quot;We’re the Demons that no one can lick;&quot;

&quot;And you’ll find us there at the final bell,&quot;

&quot;With the spirit of Twenty-six.&quot;

&quot;Every heart beats true, for the Red and the Blue,&quot;

&quot;And we sing this song to you:&quot;

&quot;Should old acquaintance be forgot,&quot;

&quot;Keep your eye on the Red and the Blue.&quot;

==Home and training grounds==
Melbourne&#x27;s home ground has been the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) since 1889. From that time to 1980, the team was part of the Melbourne Cricket Club&#x27;s sporting sections. The MCC operates and partially owns the MCG. The two clubs severed ties in 1980, though restored the relationship in 2009. The club trained on the MCG until 1985, at which point they shifted to the Junction Oval in St Kilda, which served as the club&#x27;s training base from 1986 until 2010. In 2009, the Demons first moved their training facilities from the Junction Oval to Casey Fields. Currently, the Demons&#x27; football offices and indoor training facilities are based at AAMI Park, where they moved in late 2010, and its administrative offices located within the MCG. The club trains on the adjacent Gosch&#x27;s Paddock public oval. The oval was upgraded in the 2021/22 off-season to increase the dimensions to better match the measurements of the MCG and Docklands Stadium. Redevelopment of Goschs Paddock oval commenced on 5 December 2021. Given AAMI Park is co-tenanted with three other professional sporting clubs, Melbourne have often investigated moving to a dedicated club-specific facility. In August 2021 it was reported the club was considering moving all its football and administrative offices, and indoor training facilities, to the land where Car Park E next to AAMI Park is located. In December 2023, the club commenced a feasibility study of land within the Caulfield Racecourse Reserve.

Aside from the MCG, Melbourne also plays home games in the Northern Territory: from 2010 to 2019, Melbourne played one home game per year at Marrara Oval, and have played one home game per year at Traeger Park since 2014. 

Melbourne maintains a presence at Casey Fields in Cranbourne East, the home ground of its AFLW team and VFL/VFLW affiliate the Casey Demons. It based its AFL training program at the venue for the duration of the 2021 season, which was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The club trains at Casey regularly during the summer and once every one or two weeks during the football season.

==Membership base and supporters==
Melbourne has improved their membership and attendances steadily since the failed Hawthorn merger in 1996, building a membership base of over 30,000 since 2009. The membership record of 36,937 was set in 2011 before it was broken in April 2016 to finish with 39,211 for the 2016 season, this record was broken the next year in April 2017. In May 2017, Melbourne signed up 40,000 members for the first time. In May 2019, Melbourne signed up 50,000 members for the first time. A 2000 Roy Morgan AFL survey suggested that Melbourne supporters had the highest household income.

==AFL Women&#x27;s team==
In June 2013, the club fielded a women&#x27;s representative side known as the Chappettes against in the first AFL-sanctioned women&#x27;s exhibition match, held at the MCG. The two teams competed annually over the next three years for the Hampson-Hardeman Cup. In 2016, when the AFL announced plans for AFL Women&#x27;s, an eight team national women&#x27;s league competition, Melbourne was asked to submit an application for a licence alongside other AFL clubs.
 The club was one of four Melbourne-based clubs to be granted a licence that year.

The club&#x27;s first players were marquee signings Daisy Pearce and Melissa Hickey. The full list was completed later in the year with signings and selections made in the October draft period.

Oakleigh Chargers coach Mick Stinear was appointed the team&#x27;s inaugural head coach in September 2016.

<text>A Zener diode is a type of diode designed to exploit the Zener effect to affect electric current to flow against the normal direction from anode to cathode, when the voltage across its terminals exceeds a certain characteristic threshold, the &quot;Zener voltage&quot;.

Zener diodes are manufactured with a variety of Zener voltages, including variable devices. Some types have an abrupt, heavily doped p–n junction with a low Zener voltage, in which case the reverse conduction occurs due to electron quantum tunnelling in the short distance between p and n regions. Diodes with a higher Zener voltage have more lightly doped junctions, causing their mode of operation to involve avalanche breakdown. Both breakdown types are present in Zener diodes with the Zener effect predominating at lower voltages and avalanche breakdown at higher voltages.

Zener diodes are used to generate low-power stabilized supply rails from higher voltages and to provide reference voltages for circuits, especially stabilized power supplies. They are also used to protect circuits from overvoltage, especially electrostatic discharge.

==History==
The device is named after American physicist Clarence Zener, who first described the Zener effect in 1934 in his primarily theoretical studies of the breakdown of electrical insulator properties. Later, his work led to the Bell Labs implementation of the effect in the form of an electronic device.

==Operation==

A conventional solid-state diode allows significant current if it is reverse biased above its reverse-breakdown voltage. When the reverse-bias breakdown voltage is exceeded, a conventional diode will conduct a high current due to avalanche breakdown. Unless this current is limited by external circuits, the diode may be permanently damaged due to overheating at the small (localized) areas of the semiconductor junction where avalanche breakdown conduction is occurring. A Zener diode exhibits almost the same properties, except the device is specially designed so as to have a reduced breakdown voltage, the &quot;Zener voltage&quot;. By contrast with the conventional device, a reverse-biased Zener diode exhibits a controlled breakdown and allows the current to keep the voltage across the Zener diode close to the Zener breakdown voltage. For example, a diode with a Zener breakdown voltage of 3.2 V exhibits a voltage drop of very nearly 3.2 V across a wide range of reverse currents. The Zener diode is therefore well suited for applications such as the generation of a reference voltage (e.g. for an amplifier stage), or as a voltage stabilizer for low-current applications.

Another mechanism that produces a similar effect is the avalanche effect as in the avalanche diode. The two types of diode are in fact constructed in similar ways and both effects are present in diodes of this type. In silicon diodes up to about 5.6 volts, the Zener effect is the predominant effect and shows a marked negative temperature coefficient. Above 5.6 volts, the avalanche effect dominates and exhibits a positive temperature coefficient.

In a 5.6 V diode, the two effects occur together, and their temperature coefficients nearly cancel each other out, thus the 5.6 V diode is useful in temperature-critical applications. An alternative, which is used for voltage references that need to be highly stable over long periods of time, is to use a Zener diode with a temperature coefficient (TC) of +2 mV/°C (breakdown voltage 6.2–6.3 V) connected in series with a forward-biased silicon diode (or a transistor B–E junction) manufactured on the same chip. The forward-biased diode has a temperature coefficient of −2 mV/°C, causing the TCs to cancel out for a near-zero net temperature coefficient.

It is also worth noting that the temperature coefficient of a 4.7 V Zener diode is close to that of the emitter-base junction of a silicon transistor at around −2 mV/°C, so in a simple regulating circuit where the 4.7 V diode sets the voltage at the base of an NPN transistor (i.e. their coefficients are acting in parallel), the emitter will be at around 4 V and quite stable with temperature.

Modern designs have produced devices with voltages lower than 5.6 V with negligible temperature coefficients. Higher-voltage devices have temperature coefficients that are approximately proportional to the amount by which the breakdown voltage exceeds 5 V. Thus a 75 V diode has about ten times the coefficient of a 12 V diode.

Zener and avalanche diodes, regardless of breakdown voltage, are usually marketed under the umbrella term of &quot;Zener diode&quot;.

Under 5.6 V, where the Zener effect dominates, the IV curve near breakdown is much more rounded, which calls for more care in choosing its biasing conditions. The IV curve for Zeners above 5.6 V (being dominated by avalanche), is much more precise at breakdown.

==Construction==
The Zener diode&#x27;s operation depends on the heavy doping of its p–n junction. The depletion region formed in the diode is very thin (&lt; 1 μm) and the electric field is consequently very high (about 500 kV/m) even for a small reverse bias voltage of about 5 V, allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material.

At the atomic scale, this tunneling corresponds to the transport of valence-band electrons into the empty conduction-band states, as a result of the reduced barrier between these bands and high electric fields that are induced due to the high levels of doping on both sides. The breakdown voltage can be controlled quite accurately by the doping process. Adding impurities, or doping, changes the behaviour of the semiconductor material in the diode. In the case of Zener diodes, this heavy doping creates a situation where the diode can operate in the breakdown region. While tolerances within 0.07% are available, commonly available tolerances are 5% and 10%. Breakdown voltage for commonly available Zener diodes can vary from 1.2 V to 200 V.

For diodes that are lightly doped, the breakdown is dominated by the avalanche effect rather than the Zener effect. Consequently, the breakdown voltage is higher (over 5.6 V) for these devices.

===Surface Zeners===
The emitter–base junction of a bipolar NPN transistor behaves as a Zener diode, with breakdown voltage at about 6.8 V for common bipolar processes and about 10 V for lightly doped base regions in BiCMOS processes. Older processes with poor control of doping characteristics had the variation of Zener voltage up to ±1 V, newer processes using ion implantation can achieve no more than ±0.25 V. The NPN transistor structure can be employed as a &quot;surface Zener diode&quot;, with collector and emitter connected together as its cathode and base region as anode. In this approach the base doping profile usually narrows towards the surface, creating a region with intensified electric field where the avalanche breakdown occurs. Hot carriers produced by acceleration in the intense field can inject into the oxide layer above the junction and become trapped there. The accumulation of trapped charges can then cause &#x27;Zener walkout&#x27;, a corresponding change of the Zener voltage of the junction. The same effect can be achieved by radiation damage.

The emitter–base Zener diodes can handle only low currents as the energy is dissipated in the base depletion region which is very small. Higher amounts of dissipated energy (higher current for longer time, or a short very high current spike) causes thermal damage to the junction and/or its contacts. Partial damage of the junction can shift its Zener voltage. Total destruction of the Zener junction by overheating it and causing migration of metallization across the junction (&quot;spiking&quot;) can be used intentionally as a &#x27;Zener zap&#x27; antifuse.

===Subsurface Zeners===

A subsurface Zener diode, also called a &quot;buried Zener&quot;, is a device similar to the surface Zener, but the doping and design is such that the avalanche region is located deeper in the structure, typically several micrometers below the oxide. Hot carriers then lose energy by collisions with the semiconductor lattice before reaching the oxide layer and cannot be trapped there. The Zener walkout phenomenon therefore does not occur here, and the buried Zeners have stable voltage over their entire lifetime. Most buried Zeners have breakdown voltage of 5–7 volts. Several different junction structures are used.

==Uses==

Zener diodes are widely used as voltage references and as shunt regulators to regulate the voltage across small circuits. When connected in parallel with a variable voltage source so that it is reverse biased, a Zener diode conducts when the voltage reaches the diode&#x27;s reverse breakdown voltage. From that point on, the low impedance of the diode keeps the voltage across the diode at that value.

In this circuit, a typical voltage reference or regulator, an input voltage, &quot;U&quot;in (with + on the top), is regulated down to a stable output voltage &quot;U&quot;out. The breakdown voltage of diode D is stable over a wide current range and holds &quot;U&quot;out approximately constant even though the input voltage may fluctuate over a wide range. Because of the low impedance of the diode when operated like this, resistor &quot;R&quot; is used to limit current through the circuit.

In the case of this simple reference, the current flowing in the diode is determined using Ohm&#x27;s law and the known voltage drop across the resistor &quot;R&quot;;
:formula_1

The value of &quot;R&quot; must satisfy two conditions:
# &quot;R&quot; must be small enough that the current through D keeps D in reverse breakdown. The value of this current is given in the data sheet for D. For example, the common BZX79C5V6 device, a 5.6 V 0.5 W Zener diode, has a recommended reverse current of 5mA. If insufficient current exists through D, then &quot;U&quot;out is unregulated and less than the nominal breakdown voltage (this differs from voltage-regulator tubes where the output voltage is higher than nominal and could rise as high as &quot;U&quot;in). When calculating &quot;R&quot;, allowance must be made for any current through the external load, not shown in this diagram, connected across &quot;U&quot;out.
# &quot;R&quot; must be large enough that the current through D does not destroy the device. If the current through D is &quot;I&quot;D, its breakdown voltage &quot;V&quot;B and its maximum power dissipation &quot;P&quot;max correlate as such: formula_2.

A load may be placed across the diode in this reference circuit, and as long as the Zener stays in reverse breakdown, the diode provides a stable voltage source to the load. Zener diodes in this configuration are often used as stable references for more advanced voltage regulator circuits.

Shunt regulators are simple, but the requirements that the ballast resistor be small enough to avoid excessive voltage drop during worst-case operation (low input voltage concurrent with high load current) tends to leave a lot of current flowing in the diode much of the time, making for a fairly wasteful regulator with high quiescent power dissipation, suitable only for smaller loads.

These devices are also encountered, typically in series with a base–emitter junction, in transistor stages where selective choice of a device centered on the avalanche or Zener point can be used to introduce compensating temperature co-efficient balancing of the transistor p–n junction. An example of this kind of use would be a DC error amplifier used in a regulated power supply circuit feedback loop system.

Zener diodes are also used in surge protectors to limit transient voltage spikes.

=== Noise generator ===
Another application of the Zener diode is using its avalanche breakdown noise (see ), which for instance can be used for dithering in an analog-to-digital converter when at a rms level equivalent to to 1 lsb or to create a random number generator.

===Waveform clipper===

Two Zener diodes facing each other in series clip both halves of an input signal. Waveform clippers can be used not only to reshape a signal, but also to prevent voltage spikes from affecting circuits that are connected to the power supply.

===Voltage shifter===

A Zener diode can be applied to a circuit with a resistor to act as a voltage shifter. This circuit lowers the output voltage by a quantity that is equal to the Zener diode&#x27;s breakdown voltage.
===Voltage regulator===

A Zener diode can be applied in a voltage regulator circuit to regulate the voltage applied to a load, such as in a linear regulator.

<text>Canine distemper virus (CDV) (sometimes termed &quot;footpad disease&quot;) is a viral disease that affects a wide variety of mammal families, including domestic and wild species of dogs, coyotes, foxes, pandas, wolves, ferrets, skunks, raccoons, and felines, as well as pinnipeds, some primates, and a variety of other species. CDV does not affect humans.

In canines, CDV affects several body systems, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, the spinal cord, and the brain. Common symptoms include high fever, eye inflammation and eye/nose discharge, labored breathing and coughing, vomiting and diarrhea, loss of appetite and lethargy, and hardening of the nose and footpads. The viral infection can be accompanied by secondary bacterial infections and can eventually present serious neurological symptoms.

Canine distemper is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus of the family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot; (the same family of viruses that causes measles, mumps, and bronchiolitis in humans). The disease is highly contagious via inhalation. Morbidity and mortality may vary greatly among animal species, with up to 100% mortality in unvaccinated populations of ferrets. In domestic dogs, while the acute generalized form of distemper has a high mortality rate, disease duration and severity depend mainly on the animal&#x27;s age, immune status, and the virulence of the infecting strain of the virus. Despite extensive vaccination in many regions, it remains a major disease in dogs and was the leading cause of infectious disease death in dogs prior to a vaccine becoming available.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;distemper&quot; is from Middle English , &#x27;to upset the balance of the humors,&#x27; which is from Old French &quot;,&quot; &#x27;to disturb,&#x27; which is from Vulgar Latin , &#x27;to not mix properly.&#x27;

==History==
In Europe, the first report of CDV occurred in Spain in 1761. Edward Jenner described the disease in 1809, and French veterinarian Henri Carré determined that the disease was caused by a virus in 1905. Carré&#x27;s findings were disputed by researchers in England until 1926, when Patrick Laidlaw and G.W. Dunkin confirmed that the disease was, in fact, caused by a virus.

The first vaccine against canine distemper was developed by the Italian Vittorio Puntoni. In 1923 and 1924, Puntoni published two articles in which he added formalin to brain tissue from infected dogs to create a vaccine that successfully prevented the disease in healthy dogs. A commercial vaccine was developed in 1950, yet owing to its limited use, the virus remains prevalent in many populations.

The domestic dog has largely been responsible for introducing canine distemper to previously unexposed wildlife and now causes a serious conservation threat to many species of carnivores and some species of marsupials. The virus contributed to the near-extinction of the black-footed ferret. It also may have played a considerable role in the extinction of the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) and recurrently causes mortality among African wild dogs. In 1993–1994, the lion population in the Serengeti, Tanzania, experienced a 20% decline as a result of the disease. The disease has also mutated into the phocine distemper virus, which affects seals.

==Clinical signs==
In dogs, signs of CDV vary widely, from no signs to mild respiratory signs indistinguishable from kennel cough to severe pneumonia with vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and death.

Commonly observed signs are a runny nose, vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration, excessive salivation, coughing and/or labored breathing, loss of appetite, and weight loss. If neurological signs develop, incontinence may ensue. Central nervous system signs include a localized involuntary twitching of muscles or groups of muscles, seizures with salivation, and jaw movements commonly described as &quot;chewing-gum fits,&quot; or more appropriately as &quot;distemper myoclonus.&quot; As the condition progresses, the seizures worsen and progress to grand mal convulsions, followed by the death of the animal. The animal may also show signs of sensitivity to light, incoordination, circling, increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli such as pain or touch, and deterioration of motor capabilities. Less commonly, they may lead to blindness and paralysis. The length of the systemic disease may be as short as 10 days, or the start of neurological signs may not occur until several weeks or months later. Those few that survive usually have a small tic or twitch of varying degrees of severity. With time, this tic usually diminishes somewhat in its severity.

===Lasting signs===
A dog that survives distemper can have complications afterwards. The most prevalent complication is hard pad disease, in which the skin on paw pads and skin on end of the nose thicken. Another lasting symptom that is common is enamel hypoplasia. Puppies can have damage to the enamel of teeth that are not completely formed or have not yet grown through the gums. This results from the virus killing the cells responsible for manufacturing the tooth enamel. These affected teeth tend to erode quickly.

Life-threatening complications can include nervous-system degeneration. Dogs that have been infected with distemper can have a progressive deterioration of mental abilities and motor skills. With time, the dog can develop seizures, paralysis, a reduction in sight, and incoordination. These dogs are usually humanely euthanized because of the immense pain and suffering they face.

==Virology==

Distemper is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus of the family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;, and is a very close relative of the viruses of the same genus that cause measles in humans and rinderpest in animals.

===Genetic diversity===

Geographically distinct lineages of the canine distemper virus are genetically diverse. This diversity arises from mutation and, when two genetically distinct viruses infect the same cell, from homologous recombination.

===Host range===
Distemper, or hardpad disease in canines, affects animals in the following families and species:
* Ailuridae (red panda)
* Canidae (dog, fox, wolf, Chinese raccoon dog)
* Elephantidae (Asian elephant)
* Felidae (large cats, though not domestic cats)
* Hyaenidae (hyena)
* Mustelidae (ferret, mink, skunk, wolverine, marten, badger, otter)
* Pinnipedia (seals, walrus, sea lion, etc.)
* Primate (some) (e.g., Japanese monkey, but not humans)
* Procyonidae (raccoon, coati)
* Ursidae (bear)
* Viverridae (raccoon-like South Asian binturong, palm civet)

Animals in the family Felidae, including many species of large cat as well as domestic cats, were long believed to be resistant to canine distemper until some researchers reported the prevalence of canine distemper virus (CDV) infection in large felids. Both large and domestic cats are now known to be capable of infection, usually through close housing with dogs or possibly blood transfusion from infected cats, but such infections appear to be self-limiting and largely without symptoms.

In a captive population of giant pandas in China (Shanxi Rare Wild Animal Rescue and Research Center), six of 22 captive pandas were infected by CDV. All but one infected panda died; the survivor had previously been vaccinated.

==Mechanism==

The canine distemper virus affects nearly all body systems. Puppies from 3–6 months old are particularly susceptible. CDV spreads through aerosol droplets and through contact with infected bodily fluids, including nasal and ocular secretions, feces, and urine, 6 to 22 days after exposure. It can also be spread by food and water contaminated with these fluids. The time between infection and disease is 14 to 18 days, although a fever can appear from 3 to 6 days after infection.

The canine distemper virus tends to direct its infection toward the lymphoid, epithelial, and nervous tissues. The virus initially replicates in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory tract. The virus then enters the blood stream and infects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, epithelial, and central nervous systems, as well as optic nerves. Therefore, the typical pathologic features of canine distemper include lymphoid depletion (causing immunosuppression and leading to secondary infections), interstitial pneumonia, encephalitis with demyelination, and hyperkeratosis of the nose and foot pads.

The virus first appears in bronchial lymph nodes and tonsils two days after exposure. The virus then enters the bloodstream on the second or third day. A first round of acute fever tends to begin around 3–8 days after infection, which is often accompanied by a low white blood cell count, especially of lymphocytes, as well as a low platelet count. These signs may or may not be accompanied by anorexia, a runny nose, or discharge from the eye. This first round of fever typically recedes rapidly within 96 hours, and then a second round of fever begins around the 11th or 12th day and lasts at least a week. Gastrointestinal and respiratory problems tend to follow, which may become complicated with secondary bacterial infections. Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, otherwise known as encephalomyelitis, either is associated with this, subsequently follows, or comes completely independently of these problems. A thickening of the footpads sometimes develops, and vesicular pustular lesions on the abdomen usually develop. Neurological signs are typically found in animals with thickened footpads from the virus. About half of sufferers experience meningoencephalitis. Less than 50% of the adult dogs that contract the disease die from it. Among puppies, the death rate often reaches 80%.

==Diagnosis==

The above signs, especially fever, respiratory signs, neurological signs, and thickened footpads, occurring in unvaccinated dogs strongly indicate CDV. However, several febrile diseases match many of the signs of the disease and only recently has distinguishing between canine hepatitis, herpes virus, parainfluenza, and leptospirosis been possible. Thus, finding the virus by various methods in the dog&#x27;s conjunctival cells or foot pads gives a definitive diagnosis. In older dogs that develop distemper encephalomyelitis, diagnosis may be more difficult, since many of these dogs have an adequate vaccination history.

An additional test to confirm distemper is a brush border slide of the bladder transitional epithelium of the inside lining from the bladder, stained with Diff-Quik. These infected cells have inclusions which stain a carmine red color, found in the paranuclear cytoplasm. About 90% of the bladder cells will be positive for inclusions in the early stages of distemper.

==Prevention==

A number of vaccines against CDV exist for dogs (ATCvet code: and combinations) and domestic ferrets (), which in many jurisdictions are mandatory for pets. Infected animals should be quarantined from other dogs for several months owing to the length of time the animal may shed the virus. The virus is destroyed in the environment by routine cleaning with disinfectants, detergents, or drying. It does not survive in the environment for more than a few hours at room temperature (20–25 °C), but can survive for a few weeks in shady environments at temperatures slightly above freezing. It, along with other labile viruses, can also persist longer in serum and tissue debris.

Despite extensive vaccination in many regions, it remains a major disease of dogs.

To prevent canine distemper, puppies should begin vaccination at 6–8 weeks of age and then continue getting the &quot;booster shot&quot; every 2–4 weeks until they are 16 weeks of age. Without the full series of shots, the vaccination does not provide protection against the virus. Since puppies are typically sold at the age of 8–10 weeks, they typically receive the first shot while still with their breeder, but the new owner often does not finish the series. These dogs are not protected against the virus, so are susceptible to canine distemper infection, continuing the downward spiral that leads to outbreaks throughout the world.

==Treatment==
No specific treatment for the CDV is known. As with measles, the treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Care is geared towards treating fluid/electrolyte imbalances, neurological symptoms, and preventing any secondary bacterial infections. Examples include administering fluids, electrolyte solutions, analgesics, anticonvulsants, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antipyretics, parenteral nutrition, and nursing care.

==Outcome==
The mortality rate of CDV largely depends on the immune status of the infected dogs. Puppies experience the highest mortality rate, where complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis are more common. In older dogs that develop distemper, encephalomyelitis and vestibular disease may be present. Around 15% of canine inflammatory central nervous system diseases are a result of CDV.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of canine distemper in the community has decreased dramatically due to the availability of vaccinations. However, the disease continues to spread among unvaccinated populations, such as those in animal shelters and pet stores. This provides a great threat to both the rural and urban communities throughout the United States, affecting both shelter and domestic canines. Despite the effectiveness of the vaccination, outbreaks of this disease continue to occur nationally. In April 2011, the Arizona Humane Society released a valley-wide pet health alert throughout Phoenix, Arizona.

Outbreaks of canine distemper continue to occur throughout the United States and elsewhere and are caused by many factors, including proximity to wild animals and lack of vaccinated animals. This problem is even greater within areas such as Arizona, owing to the vast amount of rural land. An unaccountable number of strays that lack vaccinations reside in these areas, so they are more susceptible to diseases such as canine distemper. These strays act as a reservoir for the virus, spreading it throughout the surrounding area, including urban areas. Puppies and dogs that have not received their shots can then be infected in a place where many dogs interact, such as a dog park.

<text>In cooking, pressure frying is a variation on pressure cooking where meat and cooking oil are brought to high temperatures while pressure is held high enough to cook the food more quickly. This leaves the meat very hot and juicy. A receptacle used in pressure frying is known as a pressure fryer. The process is most notable for its use in the preparation of fried chicken in many commercial fried chicken restaurants.

==Details==
Pressure frying is mostly done in industrial kitchens. Ordinary home pressure cookers are generally unsuitable for pressure frying, because they are typically designed for a maximum temperature around 121 °C (250 °F) whereas oil can reach temperatures well in excess of 160 °C (320 °F) which may damage the gasket in an ordinary pressure cooker, causing it to fail. Second-generation cookers are somewhat safer, but can still be dangerous if proper precautions, like obeying fill limits, are not taken.

<text>A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a dish of prepared food. A sub-recipe or subrecipe is a recipe for an ingredient that will be called for in the instructions for the main recipe. Cookbooks, which are a collection of recipes, help reflect cultural identities and social changes as well as serve as educational tools. 

==History==

===Early examples===

The earliest known written recipes date to 1730 BC and were recorded on cuneiform tablets found in Mesopotamia.

Other early written recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an Akkadian tablet from southern Babylonia. There are also works in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs depicting the preparation of food.

Many ancient Greek recipes are known. Mithaecus&#x27;s cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;. Athenaeus mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.

Roman recipes are known starting in the 2nd century BCE with Cato the Elder&#x27;s &quot;De Agri Cultura&quot;. Many authors of this period described eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and in Latin. Some Punic recipes are known in Greek and Latin translation.

The large collection of recipes &quot;De re coquinaria&quot;, conventionally titled &quot;Apicius&quot;, appeared in the 4th or 5th century and is the only complete surviving cookbook from the classical world. It lists the courses served in a meal as Gustatio (appetizer), Primae Mensae (main course) and Secundae Mensae (dessert). Each recipe begins with the Latin command &quot;Take...,&quot; &quot;Recipe...&quot;

Arabic recipes are documented starting in the 10th century; see al-Warraq and al-Baghdadi.

The earliest recipe in Persian dates from the 14th century. Several recipes have survived from the time of Safavids, including &quot;Karnameh&quot; (1521) by Mohammad Ali Bavarchi, which includes the cooking instruction of more than 130 different dishes and pastries, and &quot;Madat-ol-Hayat&quot; (1597) by Nurollah Ashpaz. Recipe books from the Qajar era are numerous, the most notable being &quot;Khorak-ha-ye Irani&quot; by prince Nader Mirza.

In older English works, a recipe was called a &quot;receipt&quot;. Both words &quot;receipt&quot; and &quot;recipe&quot; were originally used to mean instructions on how to administer medicine.

King Richard II of England commissioned a recipe book called &quot;Forme of Cury&quot; in 1390, and around the same time, another book was published entitled &quot;Curye on Inglish&quot;, &quot;cury&quot; meaning cooking. Both books give an impression of how food for the noble classes was prepared and served in England at that time. The luxurious taste of the aristocracy in the Early Modern Period brought with it the start of what can be called the modern recipe book. By the 15th century, numerous manuscripts were appearing detailing the recipes of the day. Many of these manuscripts give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including coriander, parsley, basil and rosemary, many of which had been brought back from the Crusades.
===Modern recipes and cooking advice===

With the advent of the printing press in the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous books were written on managing households and preparing food. In Holland and England competition grew between the noble families as to who could prepare the most lavish banquet. By the 1660s, cookery had progressed to an art form, and good cooks were in demand. Many of them published their own books, detailing their recipes in competition with their rivals. Many of these books have been translated and are available online.

By the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form. Although eclipsed in fame and regard by Isabella Beeton, the first modern cookery writer and compiler of recipes for the home was Eliza Acton. Her pioneering cookbook, &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; published in 1845, was aimed at the domestic reader rather than the professional cook or chef. This was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern writing about cookery. It introduced the now-universal practice of listing the ingredients and suggested cooking times with each recipe. It included the first recipe for Brussels sprouts. Contemporary chef Delia Smith called Acton &quot;the best writer of recipes in the English language.&quot; &quot;Modern Cookery&quot; long survived Acton, remaining in print until 1914 and available more recently in facsimile.

Acton&#x27;s work was an important influence on Isabella Beeton, who published &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; in 24 monthly parts between 1857 and 1861. This was a guide to running a Victorian household, with advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, and industrialism. Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. Most were illustrated with coloured engravings. It is said that many of the recipes were plagiarised from earlier writers such as Acton, but the Beetons never claimed that the book&#x27;s contents were original. It was intended as a reliable guide for the aspirant middle classes.

The American cook Fannie Farmer (1857–1915) published in 1896 her famous work &quot;The Boston Cooking School Cookbook&quot; which contained some 1,849 recipes.

==Components==
Formatting a recipe can be done in many different ways but two formats are typical. One typical format displays information in two columns, one for instructions and one for ingredients. The other typical format displays information in a solid block paragraph alternating between the ingredients and instructions.

Modern culinary recipes normally consist of several components
* The name of the recipe (Origins/History of the dish).
* Yield: The number of servings that the dish provides.
* List all ingredients in the order of its use. Describe it in step by step instructions.
* List ingredients by quantity (Can abbreviate measurements: oz instead of ounces; tbsp instead of tablespoon) 
* How much time does it take to prepare the dish, plus cooking time for the dish.
* Necessary equipment used for the dish.
* Cooking procedures. Temperature and bake time if necessary.
* Serving procedures (Served while warm/cold).
* Review of the dish (Would you recommend this dish to a friend?).
* Photograph of the dish (Optional).
* Nutritional Value: Helps for dietary restrictions. Includes number of calories or grams per serving.

Recipe writers sometimes also list variations of a traditional dish, to give different tastes of the same recipes.

Recipe writers may include a narrative before or after the recipe to add to the significance of the recipe. These consist of cultural values or personal stories relating to the dish.

=== Sub-recipes ===
A sub-recipe or subrecipe is a recipe for an ingredient that will be called for in the instructions for the main recipe.

Sub-recipes are often for spice blends, sauces, confits, pickles, preserves, jams, chutneys, or condiments. Sometimes the sub-recipe calls for the ingredient to be held for several hours, overnight, or longer, which home cooks sometimes find frustrating as it means the main recipe cannot be made in a single session or day. Sub-recipes discovered late and calling for an ingredient the cook does not have on hand means a special shopping trip or trying to find a substitute.

Sub-recipes, and the cookbooks that contain them, are often described as not being targeted at casual cooks. Reviewers have mentioned finding alternate uses for leftover sub-recipes.

Cookbooks including subrecipes include Christina Tosi&#x27;s &quot;Momofuku Milk Bar&quot; (2011) and Terry Bryant&#x27;s &quot;Vegetable Kingdom&quot; (2020).

== Internet and television recipes ==
By the mid-20th century, there were thousands of cookery and recipe books available. The next revolution came with the introduction of the TV cooks. The first TV cook in the world was Philip Harben with a show on the BBC called &quot;Cookery&quot; which premiered in June 1946. A few months later &quot;I Love to Eat&quot; presented by James Beard became the first such program in the US. TV cookery programs brought recipes to a new audience. In the early days, recipes were available by post from the BBC; later with the introduction of CEEFAX text on screen, they became available on television.

The first Internet Usenet newsgroup dedicated to cooking was &quot;net.cooks&quot; created in 1982, later becoming &quot;rec.food.cooking&quot;. It served as a forum to share recipes text files and cooking techniques.

In the U.S. in 2008, there was a renewed focus on cooking at home due to the late-2000s recession. Home cooking in the U.S. was similarly inspired in the early 2020s during the coronavirus pandemic.

The abundance of multimedia in modern food recipes allows for recipes to be more accessible to home amateur chefs. The accessibility of cookbooks online further helps home cooks improve their skills and understand the cultural identities cookbooks have. 

Television networks such as the Food Network and magazines are still a major source of recipe information, with international cooks and chefs such as Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay, Nigella Lawson and Rachael Ray having prime-time shows and backing them up with Internet websites giving the details of all their recipes. These were joined by reality TV shows such as Top Chef or Iron Chef, and many Internet sites offering free recipes, but cookery books remain as popular as ever.

== Copyright ==
Under U.S. copyright law, recipes are in the public domain. However, a collection of recipes, as in a cookbook, is able to be copyrighted. Additionally, information accompanying the recipe, such as photographs of the food or a headnote describing its cultural context, can be copyrighted.

<text>In linear algebra, the column space (also called the range or [[Row and column spaces|image]]) of a matrix &quot;A&quot; is the span (set of all possible linear combinations) of its column vectors. The column space of a matrix is the image or range of the corresponding matrix transformation.

Let formula_1 be a field. The column space of an matrix with components from formula_1 is a linear subspace of the &quot;m&quot;-space formula_3. The dimension of the column space is called the rank of the matrix and is at most . A definition for matrices over a ring formula_4 is also possible.

The row space is defined similarly.

The row space and the column space of a matrix are sometimes denoted as and respectively.

This article considers matrices of real numbers. The row and column spaces are subspaces of the real spaces formula_5 and formula_6 respectively.

==Overview==
Let be an -by- matrix. Then
* = number of pivots in any echelon form of ,
* = the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns of .

If the matrix represents a linear transformation, the column space of the matrix equals the image of this linear transformation.

The column space of a matrix is the set of all linear combinations of the columns in . If , then .

Given a matrix , the action of the matrix on a vector returns a linear combination of the columns of with the coordinates of as coefficients; that is, the columns of the matrix generate the column space.

===Example===
Given a matrix :
:formula_7
the rows are
formula_8,
formula_9,
formula_10,
formula_11.
Consequently, the row space of is the subspace of formula_12 spanned by . 
Since these four row vectors are linearly independent, the row space is 4-dimensional. Moreover, in this case it can be seen that they are all orthogonal to the vector ( is an element of the kernel of ), so it can be deduced that the row space consists of all vectors in formula_12 that are orthogonal to .

==Column space==

===Definition===

Let be a field of scalars. Let be an matrix, with column vectors . A linear combination of these vectors is any vector of the form
:formula_14
where are scalars. The set of all possible linear combinations of is called the column space of . That is, the column space of is the span of the vectors .

Any linear combination of the column vectors of a matrix can be written as the product of with a column vector:
:formula_15

Therefore, the column space of consists of all possible products , for . This is the same as the image (or range) of the corresponding matrix transformation.

==== Example ====
If formula_16, then the column vectors are and .
A linear combination of v1 and v2 is any vector of the form
formula_17
The set of all such vectors is the column space of . In this case, the column space is precisely the set of vectors satisfying the equation (using Cartesian coordinates, this set is a plane through the origin in three-dimensional space).

===Basis===
The columns of span the column space, but they may not form a basis if the column vectors are not linearly independent. Fortunately, elementary row operations do not affect the dependence relations between the column vectors. This makes it possible to use row reduction to find a basis for the column space.

For example, consider the matrix
:formula_18
The columns of this matrix span the column space, but they may not be linearly independent, in which case some subset of them will form a basis. To find this basis, we reduce to reduced row echelon form:
:formula_19
At this point, it is clear that the first, second, and fourth columns are linearly independent, while the third column is a linear combination of the first two. (Specifically, .) Therefore, the first, second, and fourth columns of the original matrix are a basis for the column space:
:formula_20
Note that the independent columns of the reduced row echelon form are precisely the columns with pivots. This makes it possible to determine which columns are linearly independent by reducing only to echelon form.

The above algorithm can be used in general to find the dependence relations between any set of vectors, and to pick out a basis from any spanning set. Also finding a basis for the column space of is equivalent to finding a basis for the row space of the transpose matrix .

To find the basis in a practical setting (e.g., for large matrices), the singular-value decomposition is typically used.

===Dimension===

The dimension of the column space is called the rank of the matrix. The rank is equal to the number of pivots in the reduced row echelon form, and is the maximum number of linearly independent columns that can be chosen from the matrix. For example, the 4 × 4 matrix in the example above has rank three.

Because the column space is the image of the corresponding matrix transformation, the rank of a matrix is the same as the dimension of the image. For example, the transformation formula_21 described by the matrix above maps all of formula_22 to some three-dimensional subspace.

The nullity of a matrix is the dimension of the null space, and is equal to the number of columns in the reduced row echelon form that do not have pivots. The rank and nullity of a matrix with columns are related by the equation:
:formula_23
This is known as the rank–nullity theorem.

===Relation to the left null space===
The left null space of is the set of all vectors such that . It is the same as the null space of the transpose of . The product of the matrix and the vector can be written in terms of the dot product of vectors:
:formula_24
because row vectors of are transposes of column vectors of . Thus if and only if is orthogonal (perpendicular) to each of the column vectors of .

It follows that the left null space (the null space of ) is the orthogonal complement to the column space of .

For a matrix , the column space, row space, null space, and left null space are sometimes referred to as the &quot;four fundamental subspaces&quot;.

===For matrices over a ring===
Similarly the column space (sometimes disambiguated as &quot;right&quot; column space) can be defined for matrices over a ring as
:formula_25
for any , with replacement of the vector -space with &quot;right free module&quot;, which changes the order of scalar multiplication of the vector to the scalar such that it is written in an unusual order &quot;vector&quot;–&quot;scalar&quot;.

==Row space==

===Definition===
Let be a field of scalars. Let be an matrix, with row vectors . A linear combination of these vectors is any vector of the form
:formula_26
where are scalars. The set of all possible linear combinations of is called the row space of . That is, the row space of is the span of the vectors .

For example, if
:formula_27
then the row vectors are and . A linear combination of and is any vector of the form
:formula_28
The set of all such vectors is the row space of . In this case, the row space is precisely the set of vectors satisfying the equation (using Cartesian coordinates, this set is a plane through the origin in three-dimensional space).

For a matrix that represents a homogeneous system of linear equations, the row space consists of all linear equations that follow from those in the system.

The column space of is equal to the row space of .

===Basis===
The row space is not affected by elementary row operations. This makes it possible to use row reduction to find a basis for the row space.

For example, consider the matrix
:formula_29
The rows of this matrix span the row space, but they may not be linearly independent, in which case the rows will not be a basis. To find a basis, we reduce to row echelon form:

, , represents the rows.
:formula_30
Once the matrix is in echelon form, the nonzero rows are a basis for the row space. In this case, the basis is . Another possible basis comes from a further reduction.

This algorithm can be used in general to find a basis for the span of a set of vectors. If the matrix is further simplified to reduced row echelon form, then the resulting basis is uniquely determined by the row space.

It is sometimes convenient to find a basis for the row space from among the rows of the original matrix instead (for example, this result is useful in giving an elementary proof that the determinantal rank of a matrix is equal to its rank). Since row operations can affect linear dependence relations of the row vectors, such a basis is instead found indirectly using the fact that the column space of is equal to the row space of . Using the example matrix above, find and reduce it to row echelon form:

:formula_31

The pivots indicate that the first two columns of form a basis of the column space of . Therefore, the first two rows of (before any row reductions) also form a basis of the row space of .

===Dimension===

The dimension of the row space is called the rank of the matrix. This is the same as the maximum number of linearly independent rows that can be chosen from the matrix, or equivalently the number of pivots. For example, the 3 × 3 matrix in the example above has rank two.

The rank of a matrix is also equal to the dimension of the column space. The dimension of the null space is called the nullity of the matrix, and is related to the rank by the following equation:
:formula_32
where is the number of columns of the matrix . The equation above is known as the rank–nullity theorem.

===Relation to the null space===
The null space of matrix is the set of all vectors for which . The product of the matrix and the vector can be written in terms of the dot product of vectors:
:formula_33
where are the row vectors of . Thus if and only if is orthogonal (perpendicular) to each of the row vectors of .

It follows that the null space of is the orthogonal complement to the row space. For example, if the row space is a plane through the origin in three dimensions, then the null space will be the perpendicular line through the origin. This provides a proof of the rank–nullity theorem (see dimension above).

The row space and null space are two of the four fundamental subspaces associated with a matrix (the other two being the column space and left null space).

===Relation to coimage===
If and are vector spaces, then the kernel of a linear transformation is the set of vectors for which . The kernel of a linear transformation is analogous to the null space of a matrix.

If is an inner product space, then the orthogonal complement to the kernel can be thought of as a generalization of the row space. This is sometimes called the coimage of . The transformation is one-to-one on its coimage, and the coimage maps isomorphically onto the image of .

When is not an inner product space, the coimage of can be defined as the quotient space .

The Australian Open typically starts around the middle of January and continues for two weeks, concluding with the men&#x27;s final traditionally held on the last Sunday of the month. It features men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles, men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and mixed doubles, juniors’ championships, wheelchair, legends, and exhibition events.

Until 1987, it was played on grass courts, but since then three types of hardcourt surfaces have been used: green-coloured Rebound Ace up to 2007 and blue Plexicushion from 2008 to 2019. Since 2020, it has been played on blue GreenSet.

First held in 1905 as the Australasian championships, the Australian Open has grown to become one of the biggest sporting events in the Southern Hemisphere. Nicknamed &quot;the happy slam&quot;, the Australian Open is the highest attended Grand Slam event, with more than 1,200,000 people attending the 2025 tournament, including qualifying. It was also the first Grand Slam tournament to feature indoor play during wet weather or extreme heat with its three primary courts, Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena and the refurbished Margaret Court Arena equipped with retractable roofs.

The Australian Open is known for its fast-paced and aggressive style of play. The tournament has been held at the Melbourne Park complex since 1988 and is a major contributor to the Victorian economy; the 2020 Australian Open injected into the state&#x27;s economy, while over the preceding decade, the Australian Open had contributed more than in economic benefits to Victoria and generated 1775 jobs for the state, with these jobs being predominantly in the accommodation, hotels, cafés and trade services sectors.

==History==
&lt;section begin=GrandSlamArticle/&gt;
The Australian Open is managed by Tennis Australia, formerly the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia (LTAA), and was first played at the Warehouseman&#x27;s Cricket Ground in Melbourne in November 1905. The facility, now known as the Albert Reserve Tennis Centre, was a grass court.

The tournament was first known as the Australasian Championships. It became the Australian Championships in 1927. Then, in 1969, it became the Australian Open. Since 1905, it has been staged 110 times in five Australian cities: Melbourne (66 times), Sydney (17 times), Adelaide (15 times), Brisbane (7 times), Perth (3 times), and two New Zealand cities: Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912).

Although it began in 1905, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) did not designate it a major championship until 1924, following a meeting held in 1923. The tournament committee changed the tournament structure to include seeding at that time. In the period of 1916–1918, no tournament was organised due to World War I.

During World War II, the tournament was not held from 1941 to 1945.
In 1972, it was decided to stage the tournament in Melbourne each year because it attracted the biggest patronage of any Australian city. The tournament was played at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club from 1972 until its move to the new Flinders Park complex in 1988.&lt;section end=GrandSlamArticle/&gt;

The new facilities at Flinders Park were envisaged to meet the demands of a tournament that had outgrown Kooyong&#x27;s capacity. The move to Flinders Park was an immediate success, with a 90 percent increase in attendance in 1988 (266,436) on the previous year at Kooyong (140,000).

Because of Australia&#x27;s geographic remoteness, very few foreign players entered the tournament in the early 20th century. In the 1920s, the trip by ship from Europe to Australia took about 45 days. The first tennis players who came by boat were the US Davis Cup players in November 1946. Even inside Australia, many players could not travel easily. When the tournament was held in Perth, no one from Victoria or New South Wales crossed by train, a distance of about between the east and west coasts. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended and the tournament was won by a New Zealander.

The first tournaments of the Australasian Championships suffered from the competition of the other Australasian tournaments. Before 1905, all Australian states, and New Zealand, had their own championships; the first being organised in 1880 in Melbourne and called the Championship of the Colony of Victoria (later the Championship of Victoria). In those years, the best two players – Australian Norman Brookes (whose name is now written on the men&#x27;s singles cup) and New Zealander Anthony Wilding – almost did not play this tournament.

Brookes took part once and won in 1911, and Wilding entered and won the competition twice (1906 and 1909). Their meetings in the Victorian Championships (or at Wimbledon) helped to determine the best Australasian players. Even when the Australasian Championships were held in Hastings, New Zealand, in 1912, Wilding, though three times Wimbledon champion, did not come back to his home country. It was a recurring problem for all players of the era. Brookes went to Europe only three times, where he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round once and then won Wimbledon twice.

Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, William Larned, Maurice McLoughlin, Beals Wright, Bill Johnston, Bill Tilden, René Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer, Ted Schroeder, Pancho Gonzales, Budge Patty, and others, while Brookes, Ellsworth Vines, Jaroslav Drobný, came just once. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when travel was less difficult, leading players such as Manuel Santana, Jan Kodeš, Manuel Orantes, Ilie Năstase (who only came once, when 35 years old) and Björn Borg came rarely or not at all.

=== Open era ===

Beginning in 1969, when the first Australian Open was held on the Milton Courts at Brisbane, the tournament was open to all players, including professionals who were not allowed to play the traditional circuit. Nevertheless, except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments, many of the best players missed the championship until 1982, because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day) and the low prize money. In 1970, George MacCall&#x27;s National Tennis League, which employed Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andrés Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Roy Emerson and Fred Stolle, prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient. The tournament was won by Arthur Ashe.

In 1983, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Mats Wilander entered the tournament. Wilander won the singles title and both his Davis Cup singles rubbers in the Swedish loss to Australia at Kooyong shortly after. Following the 1983 Australian Open, the International Tennis Federation prompted the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia to change the site of the tournament, because the Kooyong stadium was then inappropriate to serve such a big event. In 1988 the tournament was first held at Flinders Park (later renamed Melbourne Park). The change of the venue also led to a change of the court surface from grass to a hard court surface known as Rebound Ace.

Mats Wilander was the only player to win the tournament on both grass and hard courts. In 2008, after being used for 20 years, the Rebound Ace was replaced by a cushioned, medium-paced, acrylic surface known as Plexicushion Prestige. Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the only players to win the Australian Open on both Rebound Ace and Plexicushion Prestige. The main benefits of the new surface are better consistency and less retention of heat because of a thinner top layer. This change was accompanied by changes in the surfaces of all lead-up tournaments to the Australian Open. The change was controversial because of the new surface&#x27;s similarity to DecoTurf, the surface used by the US Open.

Before the Melbourne Park stadium era, tournament dates fluctuated as well, in particular in the early years because of the climate of each site or exceptional events. For example, the 1919 tournament was held in January 1920 (the 1920 tournament was played in March) and the 1923 tournament in Brisbane took place in August when the weather was not too hot and wet. After a first 1977 tournament was held in December 1976 – January 1977, the organisers chose to move the next tournament forward a few days, then a second 1977 tournament was played (ended on 31 December), but this failed to attract the best players.

From 1982 to 1985, the tournament was played in mid-December. Then it was decided to move the next tournament to mid-January (January 1987), which meant no tournament was organised in 1986. Since 1987, the Australian Open date has not changed (except for 2021, when it was postponed by three weeks to February due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Some top players, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, have said in the past that the tournament is held too soon after the Christmas and New Year holidays, and expressed a desire to consider shifting the tournament to February. Such a change, however, would move the tournament outside Australia&#x27;s summer school holiday period, potentially impacting attendance figures.

Prior to 1996, the Australian Open rewarded fewer ATP rankings points than the other three Grand Slam tournaments. The reason cited by the ATP was the prize money offered by the Australian Open was far less than the other three majors.

=== Melbourne Park expansion ===

New South Wales and overseas authorities proposed becoming the new hosts of the tournament in 2008, though such a move never materialised. In any case, it was around this time the Melbourne Park precinct commenced upgrades which enhanced facilities for players and spectators. The precinct also aimed to provide more options of refreshments especially coffee to entertain the growing number of local and international visitors.

Notably a retractable roof was placed over Margaret Court Arena, making the Open the first of the four Grand Slams to have retractable roofs available on three of their main courts. The player and administrative facilities, as well as access points for spectators, were improved and the tournament site expanded its footprint out of Melbourne Park into nearby Birrarung Marr. A fourth major show court, seating 5,000 people was completed in late 2021, along with the rest of decade-long redevelopment, which included the &quot;Centrepiece&quot; ballroom, function and media building, as well as other upgraded facilities for players, administrators and spectators.

In December 2018, tournament organisers announced the Australian Open would follow the examples set by Wimbledon and the US Open and introduce tie-breaks in the final sets of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles matches. Unlike Wimbledon and the US Open, which initiated conventional tie-breaks at 12–12 games and 6–6 games respectively, the Australian Open utilises a first to 10 points breaker at 6 games all. In 2020, the tournament organisers decided to replace the official court manufacturer to GreenSet, though retained the iconic blue cushioned acrylic hardcourt.

In 2021, in an effort to reduce the number of staff on-site due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all matches used electronic line judging. It marked the first-ever Grand Slam tournament to exclusively use electronic line judging; the 2020 US Open used it for matches outside of the two main stadium courts. 

The Australian Open produced a range of NFTs in 2022.

Starting in 2024, the Australian Open began on a Sunday, one day earlier than usual. Day sessions on Rod Laver Arena and Margaret Court Arena featured a minimum of two matches (down from three) in an effort to reduce the possibility of matches finishing in the early hours of the following morning.

The 2025 Australian Open was the first Australian Open to present pickleball. From January 24 to the 26th the AO Pickleball Slam tournament was held on Court 3 at Melbourne Park. One hundred thousand dollars in prize money was awarded to some of Australia&#x27;s top professional pickleball players.

== Courts ==

The Australian Open is played at Melbourne Park, which is located in the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct; the event moved to this site in 1988. Currently three of the courts have retractable roofs, allowing play to continue during rain and extreme heat. As of 2017, spectators can also observe play at Show Courts 2 and 3, which have capacities of 3,000 each, as well as at Courts 4–15, 19 and 20 with the aid of temporary seating grandstands of capacity anywhere from 50 to 2,500.

Construction of a new 5,000 seat capacity stadium began in 2019 as part of a redevelopment of the precinct. The new stadium, Kia Arena, was unveiled by Australian Open officials on 22 November 2021.

From 2008 to 2019, all of the courts used during the Australian Open were hard courts with Plexicushion acrylic surfaces (though Melbourne Park does have eight practice clay courts which are not used for the tournament). This replaced the Rebound Ace surface used from the opening of Melbourne Park. The ITF rated the surface&#x27;s speed as medium. Since 2020, the courts have used a GreenSet surface.

==Media coverage and attendance==
From 1973 to 2018, the Seven Network served as the host broadcaster of the Australian Open. In March 2018, it was announced that the Nine Network had acquired the rights to the tournament beginning in 2020, for a period of five years. The network later bought the rights for the 2019 tournament as well. The Open&#x27;s broadcast rights are lucrative in the country, as it occurs near the end of the Summer non-ratings season — which gives its broadcaster opportunities to promote their upcoming programming lineup. As of 2022, Nine has extended its rights to the Australian Open until 2029.

In Europe the tournament is broadcast on Eurosport. Other broadcasters in the region have included the BBC in the United Kingdom, SRG in Switzerland, NOS in Netherlands and RTS in Serbia. In the United Kingdom, the BBC dropped its live coverage of the 2016 tournament just a month before the start due to budget cuts, leaving Eurosport as the exclusive live broadcaster.

Elsewhere, beIN Sports broadcasts it into the Middle East and northern Africa, and SuperSport in sub-Sahara Africa. In the United States, the tournament is broadcast on ESPN2, ESPN3 and the Tennis Channel, with limited highlights airing on ABC. The championship matches are televised live on ESPN. While it is broadcast on ESPN International in Central and Latin America. It is broadcast on TSN in Canada.

In the Asia–Pacific region, the tournament is broadcast on five television networks in China, including national broadcaster CCTV, provincial networks Beijing TV, Shanghai Dragon TV and Guangdong TV and English language Star Sports, as well as online on iQIYI Sports. Elsewhere in the region, it is broadcast in Japan by national broadcaster NHK, and pay-TV network Wowow. In the Indian subcontinent, Sony Six has broadcast since 2015 and, in the rest of Asia, it is broadcast on Fox Sports Asia until the network&#x27;s shutdown in 2021 and the rights is acquired by beIN Sports from 2022 except for Vietnam which will be broadcast on K+.

===Attendance===
The Australian Open is the most attended Grand Slam tournament. The tournament in 2025 set a new attendance record of 1,218,831 while the single-day attendance record is 97,132, recorded on the 17 January 2025.

The following record of attendance begins in 1987, when the tournament moved from being held in December to in January (the immediate preceding tournament was December 1985). 1987 was the last year that the Kooyong Tennis Club hosted the tournament; since 1988 it has been held at Melbourne Park. The average growth rate over the period covered below is more than 7%. Note that these figures include attendances for the week of qualifying and pre-main tournament events.

<text>Lake Vostok () is the largest of Antarctica&#x27;s 675 known subglacial lakes. Lake Vostok is located at the southern Pole of Cold, beneath Russia&#x27;s Vostok Station under the surface of the central East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is at above mean sea level. The surface of this fresh water lake is approximately under the surface of the ice, which places it at approximately below sea level.

The lake is named after the Vostok Station, which derives its name from &quot;Vostok&quot; (Восток), a sloop-of-war, which means &quot;East&quot; in Russian. The existence of a subglacial lake was first suggested by Russian geographer Andrey Kapitsa based on seismic soundings made during the Soviet Antarctic Expeditions in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet. The continued research by Russian and British scientists led to the final confirmation of the existence of the lake in 1993 by J. P. Ridley using ERS-1 laser altimetry.

The overlying ice provides a continuous paleoclimatic record of 400,000 years, although the lake water itself may have been isolated for 15 to 25 million years. Because Lake Vostok may contain an environment sealed off below the ice for millions of years, the conditions could resemble those of ice-covered oceans hypothesized to exist on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa, and Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus.

On 5 February 2012, a team of Russian scientists completed the longest ever ice core of and pierced the ice shield to the surface of the lake. The first core of freshly frozen lake ice was obtained on 10 January 2013 at a depth of . However, as soon as the ice was pierced, water from the underlying lake gushed up the borehole, mixing it with the Freon and kerosene used to keep the borehole from freezing. It is hypothesized that unusual forms of life could be found in the lake&#x27;s liquid layer, a fossil water reserve. The drilling project has been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. 

==Discovery==

Russian scientist Peter Kropotkin first proposed the idea of fresh water under Antarctic ice sheets at the end of the 19th century. He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could decrease the melting point at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would become liquid water. Kropotkin&#x27;s theory was further developed by Russian glaciologist Igor Zotikov, who wrote his PhD thesis on this subject in 1967.

Russian geographer Andrey Kapitsa used seismic soundings in the region of Vostok Station made during the Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet. In the mid 1990s, Kapitsa was invited to join a symposium on Antarctica by the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge and during this time he realized that the data collected from his previous expeditions demonstrated the presence of water in the ice. The continued research by Russian and British scientists led to the final confirmation of the existence of the lake in 1993 by J. P. Ridley using ERS-1 laser altimetry.

When British scientists in Antarctica performed airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys in the early 1970s, they detected unusual radar readings at the site which suggested the presence of a liquid freshwater lake below the ice. In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a remote sensing specialist with the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, directed the ERS-1 satellite to turn its high-frequency array toward the center of the Antarctic ice cap. The data from ERS-1 confirmed the findings from the 1973 British surveys, but these new data were not published in the &quot;Journal of Glaciology&quot; until 1993. Space-based radar revealed that this subglacial body of fresh water is one of the largest lakes in the world, and one of some 140 subglacial lakes in Antarctica. Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating radar imaging observations and space-based radar altimetry, and the discovery of the lake was published in the science journal &quot;Nature&quot; on 20 June 1996. It has been confirmed that the lake contains large amounts of liquid water under the more than ice cap. The lake has at least 22 cavities of liquid water, averaging each.

The station after which the lake is named commemorates the &quot;Vostok&quot; (Восток), the 900-ton sloop-of-war ship sailed by one of the discoverers of Antarctica, Russian explorer Admiral Fabian von Bellingshausen. Because the word &quot;Vostok&quot; means &quot;East&quot; in Russian, the names of the station and lake also reflect the fact that they are located in East Antarctica.

In 2005 an island was found in the central part of the lake. Then, in January 2006, the discovery of two nearby smaller lakes under the ice cap was published; they are named 90 Degrees East and Sovetskaya. It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation &amp; Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.

==Geological history==

Africa separated from Antarctica around 160 million years ago, followed by the Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous (about 125 million years ago). About 66 million years ago, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with marsupial fauna and an extensive temperate rainforest.

The Lake Vostok basin is a small () tectonic feature within the overall setting of a several-hundred-kilometer-wide continental collision zone between the Gamburtsev Mountain Range, a subglacial mountain range and the Dome C region. The lake water is cradled on a bed of sediments thick, offering the possibility that they contain a unique record of the climate and life in Antarctica before the ice cap formed.

==Traits==

The lake water is estimated to have been sealed off under the thick ice sheet about 15 million years ago. Initially, it was thought that the same water had made up the lake since the time of its formation, giving a residence time in the order of one million years. Later research by Robin Bell and Michael Studinger from the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University suggested that the water of the lake is continually freezing and being carried away by the motion of the Antarctic ice sheet, while being replaced by water melting from other parts of the ice sheet in these high pressure conditions. This resulted in an estimate that the entire volume of the lake is replaced every 13,300 years – its effective mean residence time.

The coldest naturally occurring temperature ever observed on Earth, , was recorded at Vostok Station on 21 July 1983. The average water temperature is calculated to be around ; it remains liquid below the normal freezing point because of high pressure from the weight of the ice above it. Geothermal heat from the Earth&#x27;s interior may warm the bottom of the lake.

Lake Vostok is an oligotrophic extreme environment, one that is expected to be supersaturated with nitrogen and oxygen, measuring of nitrogen and oxygen per of water, that is 50 times higher than those typically found in ordinary freshwater lakes on Earth&#x27;s surface. The sheer weight and pressure around of the continental ice cap on top of Lake Vostok is estimated to contribute to the high gas concentration.

Besides dissolving in the water, oxygen and other gases are trapped in a type of structure called a clathrate. In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an icy cage and look like packed snow. These structures form at the high-pressure depths of Lake Vostok and would become unstable if brought to the surface.

In April 2005, German, Russian, and Japanese researchers found that the lake has tides. Depending on the position of the Sun and the Moon, the surface of the lake rises about . The lake is under complete darkness, under of pressure, and expected to be rich in oxygen, so there is speculation that any organisms inhabiting the lake could have evolved in a manner unique to this environment. There is a 1 microtesla magnetic anomaly on the east coast of the lake, spanning . Researchers hypothesize that the anomaly may be caused by a thinning of the Earth&#x27;s crust in that location.

Living &quot;Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus&quot; micro-organisms have been found in Lake Vostok&#x27;s deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species. This suggests the presence of a deep biosphere utilizing a geothermal system of the bedrock encircling the subglacial lake. There is optimism that microbial life in the lake may be possible despite high pressure, constant cold, low nutrient input, potentially high oxygen concentration and an absence of sunlight. Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa and Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus may also harbor lakes or oceans below a thick crust of ice. Any confirmation of life in Lake Vostok could strengthen the prospect for the presence of life on icy moons.

Lake Vostok measures long by wide at its widest point, it covers an area of making it the 16th largest lake by surface area. With an average depth of , it has an estimated volume of , making it the 6th largest lake by volume.

==Research==

Researchers working at Vostok Station produced one of the world&#x27;s longest ice cores in 1998. A joint Russian, French, and United States team drilled and analyzed the core, which is long. Ice samples from cores drilled close to the top of the lake have been assessed to be as old as 420,000 years. The assumption is that the lake has been sealed from the surface since the ice sheet was formed 15 million years ago. Drilling of the core was deliberately halted roughly above the suspected boundary between the ice sheet and the liquid waters of the lake. This was to prevent contamination of the lake with the 60-ton column of Freon and kerosene used to prevent the borehole from collapsing and freezing over.

From this core, specifically from ice that is thought to have formed from lake water freezing onto the base of the ice sheet, extremophile microbes were found, suggesting that the lake water supports life. Scientists suggested that the lake could possess a unique habitat for ancient bacteria with an isolated microbial gene pool containing characteristics developed perhaps 500,000 years ago.
In January 2011, the head of the Russian Antarctic Expedition, Valery Lukin, announced that his team had only of ice left to drill in order to reach the water. The researchers then switched to a new thermal drill head with a &quot;clean&quot; silicone oil fluid to drill the rest of the way. Instead of drilling all the way into the water, they said they would stop just above it when a sensor on the thermal drill detected free water. At that point, the drill was to be stopped and extracted from the bore hole. Removal of the drill would lower the pressure beneath it, drawing water into the hole to be left to freeze, creating a plug of ice in the bottom of the hole. Drilling stopped on 5 February 2011 at a depth of so that the research team could make it off the ice before the beginning of the Antarctic winter season. The drilling team left by aircraft on 6 February 2011.

By plan, the following summer, the team was to drill down again to take a sample of that ice and analyze it. The Russians resumed drilling into the lake in January 2012 and reached the upper surface of the water on 6 February 2012.

===Biology results===

====United Kingdom and United States====
Scientists first reported evidence of microbes in the accretion ice in 1999. Since then, a different team led by Scott O. Rogers has been identifying a variety of bacteria and fungi from accretion ice (not from the subglacial water layer) collected during U.S. drilling projects in the 1990s. According to him, this indicates that the lake below the ice is not sterile but contains a unique ecosystem. Then Scott Rogers published in July 2013 that his team performed nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) sequencing and the results allowed deduction of the metabolic pathways represented in the accretion ice and, by extension, in the lake. The team found 3,507 unique gene sequences, and approximately 94% of the sequences were from bacteria and 6% were from Eukarya. Taxonomic classifications (to genus and/or species) or identification were possible for 1,623 of the sequences. In general, the taxa were similar to organisms previously described from lakes, brackish water, marine environments, soil, glaciers, ice, lake sediments, deep-sea sediments, deep-sea thermal vents, animals and plants. Sequences from aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, acidophilic, desiccation-resistant, autotrophic, and heterotrophic organisms were present, including a number from multicellular eukaryotes. In the 2013 study, the presence of bacteria that inhabit fish intestines was also reported.

Microbiologist David Pearce of the University of Northumbria in Newcastle, UK, stated that the DNA could simply be contamination from the drilling process, and not representative of Lake Vostok itself. The old ice cores were drilled in the 1990s to look for evidence of past climates buried in the ice, rather than for life, so the drilling equipment was not sterilized. Also Sergey Bulat, a Lake Vostok expert at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Gatchina, Russia, doubts that any of the cells or DNA fragments in the samples would belong to organisms that might actually exist in the lake. He says that it is very probable that the samples are heavily contaminated with tissue and microbes from the outside world. The possibility of contamination has been refuted by Scott Rogers.

In 2020, Colby Gura and Scott Rogers extended their study of Lake Vostok accretion ice, as well as the basal ice flowing into the lake. They found that the basal ice contained an almost completely different community of organisms compared to those found in the lake accretion ice, indicating that they signified two completely different ecosystems. Additional bacteria and eukaryotes were reported. The highest diversity of organisms in the lake ice was significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with higher concentrations of ions and amino acids. The 2020 study again found the presence of bacteria that inhabit fish intestines and a molecular sequence closest to a rock cod common along the coast of Antarctica, &quot;Notothenia coriiceps,&quot; which produces antifreeze proteins.

====Russia and France====
In 2013, Russian scientists conducted molecular DNA studies from water samples collected from Lake Vostok. Scientists have been able to identify 255 contaminant species, but also have found an unknown bacterium when they initially drilled down to the lake&#x27;s surface in 2012, with no matches in any international databases, and they hope it may be a unique inhabitant of Lake Vostok. However, Vladimar Korolev, the laboratory head of the study at the same institution, said that the bacteria could in principle be a contaminant that uses kerosene—the antifreeze used during drilling—as an energy source.

In January 2015, the Russian press stated that Russian scientists have made a new &quot;clean&quot; borehole into Lake Vostok using a special 50-kilogram probe that collected about 1 liter of water not adulterated by the antifreezing fluid. The drilling technology used proved to be inappropriate to collect liquid water in general and clean samples in particular and results were unreported. It was predicted that the water would rise 30–40 m in the bottom part of the borehole, but in fact the water rose from the lake to a height of more than 500 m. In October of that same year, the work was suspended for that southern summer because of insufficient funding by the federal Russian government.

In 2019 the Russian government ordered that a new wintering complex be installed at the Lake Vostok research station, funded in part by Russian billionaire Leonid Mikhelson. This complex will be capable of supporting 35 people in the summer, 15 in the winter and will have 4 diesel generators with a capacity of 200 kilowatts each. The new complex, consisting of 133 modules, was delivered to Progress Station in December 2021 and will be transported to the Lake Vostok research station and installed over the next four years.

===Contamination due to drilling fluids===
The drilling project has been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The main concern is that the lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the borehole from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.

The original drilling technique employed by the Russians involved the use of Freon and kerosene to lubricate the borehole and prevent it from collapsing and freezing over; of these chemicals have been used thus far on the ice above Lake Vostok. Other countries, particularly the United States and Britain, have failed to persuade the Russians not to pierce to the lake until cleaner technologies such as hot-water drilling are available. Though the Russians claim to have improved their operations, they continue to use the same borehole, which has already been contaminated with kerosene. According to the head of Russian Antarctic Expeditions, Valery Lukin, new equipment was developed by researchers at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute that would ensure the lake remains uncontaminated upon intrusion. Lukin has repeatedly reassured other signatory nations to the Antarctic Treaty System that the drilling will not affect the lake, arguing that on breakthrough, water will rush up the borehole, freeze, and seal the other fluids out.

Some environmentalist groups remain unconvinced by these arguments. The Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition has argued that this manner of drilling is a profoundly misguided step that endangers Lake Vostok and other subglacial lakes in Antarctica (which some scientists are convinced are inter-linked with Lake Vostok). The coalition has asserted that &quot;it would be far preferable to join with other countries to penetrate a smaller and more isolated lake before re-examining whether penetration of Lake Vostok is environmentally defensible. If we are wise, the Lake will be allowed to reveal its secrets in due course.&quot;

Lukin claims that hot-water drilling is much more dangerous for the microbiotic fauna, as it would boil the living species, and disturb the entire structure of water layers of the lake. Additionally, hot-water drilling would have required more power than the Russian expedition could have generated at their remote camp. However, the water samples obtained by the Russian team were heavily contaminated with drilling fluid, so they reported in May 2017 that it was impossible at this time to obtain reliable data on the real chemical and biological composition of the lake water.

<text>Wilbur Herschel Jennings (June 27, 1944 – September 6, 2024) was an American lyricist. He was known for writing the songs &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;, &quot;Higher Love&quot;, &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and won several awards including three Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and two Academy Awards.

==Background==
Wilbur Herschel Jennings was born in Kilgore, Texas, on June 27, 1944, the youngest of three siblings. He had two sisters, Joyce and Gloria. He attended school near Tyler, Texas, in the Chapel Hill Independent School District. He graduated from Tyler Junior College and taught English at the college. In 1966, Jennings earned his B.A. from Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas; he earned a master&#x27;s degree the following year and taught English there. He taught at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire for three years, then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1971 to begin his songwriting career.

==Career==
Jennings was described as &quot;the most erudite of lyricists&quot;. He wrote for a variety of artists, including Steve Winwood, Whitney Houston, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Joe Sample, Rodney Crowell, Mariah Carey, Jimmy Buffett, Barry Manilow, and Roy Orbison. In Nashville he worked with other composers, and his first big hit came when Manilow took his joint composition with Richard Kerr, &quot;Looks Like We Made It&quot;, to number 1 in 1977.

With Steve Winwood, Jennings wrote a series of albums including &quot;Arc of a Diver&quot;, &quot;Talking Back to the Night&quot;, and &quot;Back in the High Life&quot;, an album that contained the hits &quot;Higher Love&quot;, &quot;The Finer Things&quot;, and &quot;Back in the High Life Again&quot;. Winwood won the Record Of The Year and Outstanding Male Vocal Performance. Both Jennings and Winwood were nominated for the Song of the Year award for &quot;Higher Love.&quot;

With Joe Sample, Jennings wrote &quot;Street Life&quot; (a world-wide hit for the Crusaders with singer Randy Crawford) and several songs for various albums by the Crusaders for guest vocalists, including Joe Cocker (&quot;I&#x27;m So Glad I&#x27;m Standing Here Today&quot;), and Bill Withers (&quot;Soul Shadows&quot;). Jennings and Sample also wrote the better part of three albums for B.B. King, &quot;Midnight Believer&quot; in 1978, &quot;Take It Home&quot; in 1979, and &quot;There Is Always One More Time&quot; in 1991.

Richard Kerr and Jennings wrote &quot;Somewhere in the Night&quot; and &quot;Looks Like We Made It&quot; for Barry Manilow and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Love This Way Again&quot; for Dionne Warwick. Deana Martin recorded one of Jennings&#x27;s songs, &quot;I Know Who You Are&quot;, on her 2016 album &quot;Swing Street&quot;.

Jennings collaborated on many songs for film, the most notable being &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; for &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, a song that won the Academy Award in America and the BAFTA (British Academy Award) in the United Kingdom and was a number one hit for Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes. In 1997, Jennings wrote the world-wide number one Céline Dion hit &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; for the film &quot;Titanic&quot; with his collaborator James Horner. The song became one of the most successful songs of all time and won the Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Song. They also won Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture at the 41st Grammy Awards. &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s director, James Cameron, had at first been opposed to having a theme song playing over the closing credits, but Horner, having composed the instrumental motif, felt that it needed words and secretly had Jennings write a lyric. Cameron liked it and included it in the film.

Among his other collaborations were two albums written with Jimmy Buffett and Michael Utley, &quot;Riddles in the Sand&quot; and &quot;The Last Mango in Paris&quot;. Jennings also wrote several songs for Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;King of Hearts&quot; album.

In Nashville, Jennings wrote hits with Rodney Crowell, including &quot;Many a Long &amp; Lonesome Highway&quot;, &quot;What Kind of Love&quot;, and &quot;Please Remember Me&quot;, a number one country hit for Tim McGraw. Jennings also wrote &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; with Eric Clapton, which won song of the Year and also won the Ivor Novello award for best song from a film.

Teaming with James Horner and Mariah Carey, Jennings wrote the lyrics for the central song in &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;, &quot;Where Are You Christmas?&quot;, sung by a character within the film and by Faith Hill at the end of the film. In 2002, Horner and Jennings contributed a song for the Oscar-winning film &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;. In 2002, Peter Wolf&#x27;s new album, &quot;Sleepless&quot;, appeared with positive reviews. The album featured six songs written by Jennings and Wolf, who collaborated previously on &quot;Fool&#x27;s Parade&quot; (1999) on Mercury Records.

Jennings and Joe Sample, the keyboard player for the Crusaders, went back to 1978 and began by writing the &quot;Midnight Believer&quot; album for B.B. King and then wrote the hit &quot;Street Life&quot; for the Crusaders album of the same name. Jennings and Sample also wrote &quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;, originally sung by Crawford, which was featured in the film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, along with another of Jennings&#x27;s songs, &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;. In the film &quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; was sung by Nicole Kidman and, in March 2002, was released as a single in the UK from the second soundtrack album to emerge from &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

<doc id="97911" wikidata="Q1617865" url="?curid=97911" title="Size-exclusion chromatography">
<text>Size-exclusion chromatography, also known as molecular sieve chromatography, is a chromatographic method in which molecules in solution are separated by their shape, and in some cases size. It is usually applied to large molecules or macromolecular complexes such as proteins and industrial polymers. Typically, when an aqueous solution is used to transport the sample through the column, the technique is known as gel-filtration chromatography, versus the name gel permeation chromatography, which is used when an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase. The chromatography column is packed with fine, porous beads which are commonly composed of dextran, agarose, or polyacrylamide polymers. The pore sizes of these beads are used to estimate the dimensions of macromolecules. SEC is a widely used polymer characterization method because of its ability to provide good molar mass distribution (Mw) results for polymers.

Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is fundamentally different from all other chromatographic techniques in that separation is based on a simple procedure of classifying molecule sizes rather than any type of interaction.

==Applications==
The main application of size-exclusion chromatography is the fractionation of proteins and other water-soluble polymers, while gel permeation chromatography is used to analyze the molecular weight distribution of organic-soluble polymers. Either technique should not be confused with gel electrophoresis, where an electric field is used to &quot;pull&quot; molecules through the gel depending on their electrical charges. The amount of time a solute remains within a pore is dependent on the size of the pore. Larger solutes will have access to a smaller volume and vice versa. Therefore, a smaller solute will remain within the pore for a longer period of time compared to a larger solute.

Even though size exclusion chromatography is widely utilized to study natural organic material, there are limitations. One of these limitations include that there is no standard molecular weight marker; thus, there is nothing to compare the results back to. If precise molecular weight is required, other methods should be used.

==Advantages==
The advantages of this method include good separation of large molecules from the small molecules with a minimal volume of eluate, and that various solutions can be applied without interfering with the filtration process, all while preserving the biological activity of the particles to separate. The technique is generally combined with others that further separate molecules by other characteristics, such as acidity, basicity, charge, and affinity for certain compounds. With size exclusion chromatography, there are short and well-defined separation times and narrow bands, which lead to good sensitivity. There is also no sample loss because solutes do not interact with the stationary phase.

The other advantage to this experimental method is that in certain cases, it is feasible to determine the approximate molecular weight of a compound. The shape and size of the compound (eluent) determine how the compound interacts with the gel (stationary phase). To determine approximate molecular weight, the elution volumes of compounds with their corresponding molecular weights are obtained and then a plot of “Kav” vs “log(Mw)” is made, where formula_1 and Mw is the molecular mass. This plot acts as a calibration curve, which is used to approximate the desired compound&#x27;s molecular weight. The Ve component represents the volume at which the intermediate molecules elute such as molecules that have partial access to the beads of the column. In addition, Vt is the sum of the total volume between the beads and the volume within the beads. The Vo component represents the volume at which the larger molecules elute, which elute in the beginning. Disadvantages are, for example, that only a limited number of bands can be accommodated because the time scale of the chromatogram is short, and, in general, there must be a 10% difference in molecular mass to have a good resolution.

== Discovery ==
The technique was invented in 1955 by Grant Henry Lathe and Colin R Ruthven, working at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Hospital, London. They later received the John Scott Award for this invention. While Lathe and Ruthven used starch gels as the matrix, Jerker Porath and Per Flodin later introduced dextran gels; other gels with size fractionation properties include agarose and polyacrylamide. A short review of these developments has appeared.

There were also attempts to fractionate synthetic high polymers; however, it was not until 1964, when J. C. Moore of the Dow Chemical Company published his work on the preparation of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) columns based on cross-linked polystyrene with controlled pore size, that a rapid increase of research activity in this field began. It was recognized almost immediately that with proper calibration, GPC was capable to provide molar mass and molar mass distribution information for synthetic polymers. Because the latter information was difficult to obtain by other methods, GPC came rapidly into extensive use.

== Theory and method ==
SEC is used primarily for the analysis of large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works by trapping smaller molecules in the pores of the adsorbent (&quot;stationary phase&quot;). This process is usually performed within a column, which typically consists of a hollow tube tightly packed with micron-scale polymer beads containing pores of different sizes. These pores may be depressions on the surface or channels through the bead. As the solution travels down the column some particles enter into the pores. Larger particles cannot enter into as many pores. The larger the particles, the faster the elution. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores because those molecules are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column more quickly than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.

One requirement for SEC is that the analyte does not interact with the surface of the stationary phases, with differences in elution time between analytes ideally being based solely on the solute volume the analytes can enter, rather than chemical or electrostatic interactions with the stationary phases. Thus, a small molecule that can penetrate every region of the stationary phase pore system can enter a total volume equal to the sum of the entire pore volume and the interparticle volume. This small molecule elutes late (after the molecule has penetrated all of the pore- and interparticle volume—approximately 80% of the column volume). At the other extreme, a very large molecule that cannot penetrate any the smaller pores can enter only the interparticle volume (~35% of the column volume) and elutes earlier when this volume of mobile phase has passed through the column. The underlying principle of SEC is that particles of different sizes elute (filter) through a stationary phase at different rates. This results in the separation of a solution of particles based on size. Provided that all the particles are loaded simultaneously or near-simultaneously, particles of the same size should elute together.

However, as there are various measures of the size of a macromolecule (for instance, the radius of gyration and the hydrodynamic radius), a fundamental problem in the theory of SEC has been the choice of a proper molecular size parameter by which molecules of different kinds are separated. Experimentally, Benoit and co-workers found an excellent correlation between elution volume and a dynamically based molecular size, the hydrodynamic volume, for several different chain architecture and chemical compositions. The observed correlation based on the hydrodynamic volume became accepted as the basis of universal SEC calibration.

Still, the use of the hydrodynamic volume, a size based on dynamical properties, in the interpretation of SEC data is not fully understood. This is because SEC is typically run under low flow rate conditions where hydrodynamic factor should have little effect on the separation. In fact, both theory and computer simulations assume a thermodynamic separation principle: the separation process is determined by the equilibrium distribution (partitioning) of solute macromolecules between two phases: a dilute bulk solution phase located at the interstitial space and confined solution phases within the pores of column packing material. Based on this theory, it has been shown that the relevant size parameter to the partitioning of polymers in pores is the mean span dimension (mean maximal projection onto a line). Although this issue has not been fully resolved, it is likely that the mean span dimension and the hydrodynamic volume are strongly correlated.
Each size exclusion column has a range of molecular weights that can be separated. The exclusion limit defines the molecular weight at the upper end of the column &#x27;working&#x27; range and is where molecules are too large to get trapped in the stationary phase. The lower end of the range is defined by the permeation limit, which defines the molecular weight of a molecule that is small enough to penetrate all pores of the stationary phase. All molecules below this molecular mass are so small that they elute as a single band.

The filtered solution that is collected at the end is known as the eluate. The void volume includes any particles too large to enter the medium, and the solvent volume is known as the column volume.

Following are the materials which are commonly used for porous gel beads in size exclusion chromatography 
==Factors affecting filtration==

In real-life situations, particles in solution do not have a fixed size, resulting in the probability that a particle that would otherwise be hampered by a pore passing right by it. Also, the stationary-phase particles are not ideally defined; both particles and pores may vary in size. Elution curves, therefore, resemble Gaussian distributions. The stationary phase may also interact in undesirable ways with a particle and influence retention times, though great care is taken by column manufacturers to use stationary phases that are inert and minimize this issue.

Like other forms of chromatography, increasing the column length enhances resolution, and increasing the column diameter increases column capacity. Proper column packing is important for maximum resolution: An over-packed column can collapse the pores in the beads, resulting in a loss of resolution. An under-packed column can reduce the relative surface area of the stationary phase accessible to smaller species, resulting in those species spending less time trapped in pores. Unlike affinity chromatography techniques, a solvent head at the top of the column can drastically diminish resolution as the sample diffuses prior to loading, broadening the downstream elution.

== Analysis ==
In simple manual columns, the eluent is collected in constant volumes, known as fractions. The more similar the particles are in size the more likely they are in the same fraction and not detected separately. More advanced columns overcome this problem by constantly monitoring the eluent.
The collected fractions are often examined by spectroscopic techniques to determine the concentration of the particles eluted. Common spectroscopy detection techniques are refractive index (RI) and ultraviolet (UV). When eluting spectroscopically similar species (such as during biological purification), other techniques may be necessary to identify the contents of each fraction. It is also possible to analyze the eluent flow continuously with RI, LALLS, Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering MALS, UV, and/or viscosity measurements.

The elution volume (Ve) decreases roughly linear with the logarithm of the molecular hydrodynamic volume. Columns are often calibrated using 4-5 standard samples (e.g., folded proteins of known molecular weight), and a sample containing a very large molecule such as thyroglobulin to determine the void volume. (Blue dextran is not recommended for Vo determination because it is heterogeneous and may give variable results) The elution volumes of the standards are divided by the elution volume of the thyroglobulin (Ve/Vo) and plotted against the log of the standards&#x27; molecular weights.

==Applications==

===Biochemical applications===
In general, SEC is considered a low-resolution chromatography as it does not discern similar species very well, and is therefore often reserved for the final step of a purification. The technique can determine the quaternary structure of purified proteins that have slow exchange times, since it can be carried out under native solution conditions, preserving macromolecular interactions. SEC can also assay protein tertiary structure, as it measures the hydrodynamic volume (not molecular weight), allowing folded and unfolded versions of the same protein to be distinguished. For example, the apparent hydrodynamic radius of a typical protein domain might be 14 Å and 36 Å for the folded and unfolded forms, respectively. SEC allows the separation of these two forms, as the folded form elutes much later due to its smaller size.

===Polymer synthesis===

SEC can be used as a measure of both the size and the polydispersity of a synthesized polymer, that is, the ability to find the distribution of the sizes of polymer molecules. If standards of a known size are run previously, then a calibration curve can be created to determine the sizes of polymer molecules of interest in the solvent chosen for analysis (often THF). In alternative fashion, techniques such as light scattering and/or viscometry can be used online with SEC to yield absolute molecular weights that do not rely on calibration with standards of known molecular weight. Due to the difference in size of two polymers with identical molecular weights, the absolute determination methods are, in general, more desirable. A typical SEC system can quickly (in about half an hour) give polymer chemists information on the size and polydispersity of the sample. The preparative SEC can be used for polymer fractionation on an analytical scale.

==Drawbacks==

In SEC, mass is not measured so much as the hydrodynamic volume of the polymer molecules, that is, how much space a particular polymer molecule takes up when it is in solution. However, the approximate molecular weight can be calculated from SEC data because the exact relationship between molecular weight and hydrodynamic volume for polystyrene can be found. For this, polystyrene is used as a standard. But the relationship between hydrodynamic volume and molecular weight is not the same for all polymers, so only an approximate measurement can be obtained.
Another drawback is the possibility of interaction between the stationary phase and the analyte. Any interaction leads to a later elution time and thus mimics a smaller analyte size.

When performing this method, the bands of the eluting molecules may be broadened. This can occur by turbulence caused by the flow of the mobile phase molecules passing through the molecules of the stationary phase. In addition, molecular thermal diffusion and friction between the molecules of the glass walls and the molecules of the eluent contribute to the broadening of the bands. Besides broadening, the bands also overlap with each other. As a result, the eluent usually gets considerably diluted. A few precautions can be taken to prevent the likelihood of the bands broadening. For instance, one can apply the sample in a narrow, highly concentrated band on the top of the column. The more concentrated the eluent is, the more efficient the procedure would be. However, it is not always possible to concentrate the eluent, which can be considered as one more disadvantage.

==Absolute size-exclusion chromatography==
Absolute size-exclusion chromatography (ASEC) is a technique that couples a light scattering instrument, most commonly multi-angle light scattering (MALS) or another form of static light scattering (SLS), but possibly a dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument, to a size-exclusion chromatography system for absolute molar mass and/or size measurements of proteins and macromolecules as they elute from the chromatography system.

The definition of “absolute” in this case is that calibration of retention time on the column with a set of reference standards is not required to obtain molar mass or the hydrodynamic size, often referred to as hydrodynamic diameter (DH in units of nm). Non-ideal column interactions, such as electrostatic or hydrophobic surface interactions that modulate retention time relative to standards, do not impact the final result. Likewise, differences between conformation of the analyte and the standard have no effect on an absolute measurement; for example, with MALS analysis, the molar mass of inherently disordered proteins are characterized accurately even though they elute at much earlier times than globular proteins with the same molar mass, and the same is true of branched polymers which elute late compared to linear reference standards with the same molar mass. Another benefit of ASEC is that the molar mass and/or size is determined at each point in an eluting peak, and therefore indicates homogeneity or polydispersity within the peak. For example, SEC-MALS analysis of a monodisperse protein will show that the entire peak consists of molecules with the same molar mass, something that is not possible with standard SEC analysis.

Determination of molar mass with SLS requires combining the light scattering measurements with concentration measurements. Therefore SEC-MALS typically includes the light scattering detector and either a differential refractometer or UV/Vis absorbance detector. In addition, MALS determines the rms radius Rg of molecules above a certain size limit, typically 10 nm. SEC-MALS can therefore analyze the conformation of polymers via the relationship of molar mass to Rg. For smaller molecules, either DLS or, more commonly, a differential viscometer is added to determine hydrodynamic radius and evaluate molecular conformation in the same manner.

In SEC-DLS, the sizes of the macromolecules are measured as they elute into the flow cell of the DLS instrument from the size exclusion column set. The hydrodynamic size of the molecules or particles are measured and not their molecular weights. For proteins a Mark-Houwink type of calculation can be used to estimate the molecular weight from the hydrodynamic size.

A major advantage of DLS coupled with SEC is the ability to obtain enhanced DLS resolution. Batch DLS is quick and simple and provides a direct measure of the average size, but the baseline resolution of DLS is a ratio of 3:1 in diameter. Using SEC, the proteins and protein oligomers are separated, allowing oligomeric resolution. Aggregation studies can also be done using ASEC. Though the aggregate concentration may not be calculated with light scattering (an online concentration detector such as that used in SEC-MALS for molar mass measurement also determines aggregate concentration), the size of the aggregate can be measured, only limited by the maximum size eluting from the SEC columns.

Limitations of ASEC with DLS detection include flow-rate, concentration, and precision. Because a correlation function requires anywhere from 3–7 seconds to properly build, a limited number of data points can be collected across the peak. ASEC with SLS detection is not limited by flow rate and measurement time is essentially instantaneous, and the range of concentration is several orders of magnitude larger than for DLS. However, molar mass analysis with SEC-MALS does require accurate concentration measurements. MALS and DLS detectors are often combined in a single instrument for more comprehensive absolute analysis following separation by SEC.

<doc id="97914" wikidata="Q904893" url="?curid=97914" title="Differential scanning calorimetry">
<text>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermoanalytical technique in which the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment.

Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned.

Additionally, the reference sample must be stable, of high purity, and must not experience much change across the temperature scan. Typically, reference standards have been metals such as indium, tin, bismuth, and lead, but other standards such as polyethylene and fatty acids have been proposed to study polymers and organic compounds, respectively.

The technique was developed by E. S. Watson and M. J. O&#x27;Neill in 1962, and introduced commercially at the 1963 Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy.

The first adiabatic differential scanning calorimeter that could be used in biochemistry was developed by P. L. Privalov and D. R. Monaselidze in 1964 at Institute of Physics in Tbilisi, Georgia. The term DSC was coined to describe this instrument, which measures energy directly and allows precise measurements of heat capacity.

==Types==
There are two main types of DSC: &quot;Heat-flux DSC&quot; which measures the difference in heat flux between the sample and a reference (which gives it the alternative name &quot;Multi-Cell DSC&quot;) and &quot;Power differential DSC&quot; which measures the difference in power supplied to the sample and a reference.

===Heat-flux DSC===
With Heat-flux DSC, the changes in heat flow are calculated by integrating the ΔTref- curve. For this kind of experiment, a sample and a reference crucible are placed on a sample holder with integrated temperature sensors for temperature measurement of the crucibles. This arrangement is located in a temperature-controlled oven. Unlike the traditional design, the special feature of heat-flux DSC is that it uses flat temperature sensors placed vertically around a flat heater. This setup makes it possible to have a small, light, and low-heat capacity structure while still working like a regular DSC oven.

===Power differential DSC===
For this kind of setup, also known as &quot;Power compensating DSC&quot;, the sample and reference crucible are placed in thermally insulated furnaces and not next to each other in the same furnace as in heat-flux-DSC experiments. Then the temperature of both chambers is controlled so that the same temperature is always present on both sides. The electrical power that is required to obtain and maintain this state is then recorded rather than the temperature difference between the two crucibles.

===Fast-scan DSC===
The 2000s have witnessed the rapid development of Fast-scan DSC (FSC), a novel calorimetric technique that employs micromachined sensors. The key advances of this technique are the ultrahigh scanning rate, which can be as high as 106 K/s, and the ultrahigh sensitivity, with a heat capacity resolution typically better than 1 nJ/K.

Nanocalorimetry has attracted much attention in materials science, where it is applied to perform quantitative analysis of rapid phase transitions, particularly on fast cooling. Another emerging area of application of FSC is physical chemistry, with a focus on the thermophysical properties of thermally labile compounds. Quantities like fusion temperature, fusion enthalpy, sublimation, and vaporization pressures, and enthalpies of such molecules became available.

===Temperature Modulated DSC===
When performing Temperature Modulated DSC (TMDSC, MDSC), the underlying linear heating rate is superimposed by a sinusoidal temperature variation. The benefit of this procedure is the ability to separate overlapping DSC effects by calculating the reversing and the non-reversing signals. The reversing heat flow is related to the changes in specific heat capacity (→ glass transition) while the non-reversing heat flow corresponds to time-dependent phenomena such as curing, dehydration and relaxation.

==Detection of phase transitions==
The basic principle underlying this technique is that when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as phase transitions, more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process is exothermic or endothermic.

For example, as a solid sample melts to a liquid, it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature at the same rate as the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the endothermic phase transition from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes exothermic processes (such as crystallization) less heat is required to raise the sample temperature. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning calorimeters are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during such transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer curing.

==DTA==
An alternative technique, which shares much in common with DSC, is differential thermal analysis (DTA). In this technique it is the heat flow to the sample and reference that remains the same rather than the temperature. When the sample and reference are heated identically, phase changes and other thermal processes cause a difference in temperature between the sample and reference. Both DSC and DTA provide similar information. DSC measures the energy required to keep both the reference and the sample at the same temperature whereas DTA measures the difference in temperature between the sample and the reference when the same amount of energy has been introduced into both.

==DSC curves==

The result of a DSC experiment is a curve of heat flux versus temperature or versus time. There are two different conventions: exothermic reactions in the sample shown with a positive or negative peak, depending on the kind of technology used in the experiment. This curve can be used to calculate enthalpies of transitions. This is done by integrating the peak corresponding to a given transition. It can be shown that the enthalpy of transition can be expressed using the following equation:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the enthalpy of transition, formula_3 is the calorimetric constant, and formula_4 is the area under the curve. The calorimetric constant will vary from instrument to instrument, and can be determined by analyzing a well-characterized sample with known enthalpies of transition.

==Applications==
Differential scanning calorimetry can be used to measure a number of characteristic properties of a sample. Using this technique it is possible to observe fusion and crystallization events as well as glass transition temperatures &quot;Tg&quot;. DSC can also be used to study oxidation, as well as other chemical reactions.

Glass transitions may occur as the temperature of an amorphous solid is increased. These transitions appear as a step in the baseline of the recorded DSC signal. This is due to the sample undergoing a change in heat capacity; no formal phase change occurs.

As the temperature increases, an amorphous solid will become less viscous. At some point the molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This is known as the crystallization temperature (&quot;Tc&quot;). This transition from amorphous solid to crystalline solid is an exothermic process, and results in a peak in the DSC signal. As the temperature increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (&quot;Tm&quot;). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine transition temperatures and enthalpies makes DSC a valuable tool in producing phase diagrams for various chemical systems.

Differential scanning calorimetry can also be used to obtain valuable thermodynamics information about proteins. The thermodynamics analysis of proteins can reveal important information about the global structure of proteins, and protein/ligand interaction. For example, many mutations lower the stability of proteins, while ligand binding usually increases protein stability. Using DSC, this stability can be measured by obtaining Gibbs Free Energy values at any given temperature. This allows researchers to compare the free energy of unfolding between ligand-free protein and protein-ligand complex, or wild type and mutant proteins. DSC can also be used in studying protein/lipid interactions, nucleotides, drug-lipid interactions. In studying protein denaturation using DSC, the thermal melt should be at least to some degree reversible, as the thermodynamics calculations rely on chemical equilibrium.

==Experimental considerations==
There are various experimental and environmental parameters to consider during DSC measurements. Exemplary potential issues are briefly discussed in the following sections. All statements in these paragraphs are based on the books of Gabbott and Brown.

===Crucibles===
DSC measurements without crucibles promote the thermal transfer towards the sample and are possible if the DSC is designed for this purpose. Measurements without crucible should only be conducted with chemically stable materials at low temperatures, as otherwise there may be contamination or damage of the calorimeter. The safer way is to use a crucible, which is specified for the desired temperatures and does not react with the sample material (e.g. alumina, gold or platinum crucibles). If the sample is likely to evolve volatiles or is in the liquid state, the crucible should be sealed to prevent contamination. However, if the crucible is sealed, increasing pressure and possible measurement artefacts due to deformation of the crucible must be considered. In this case, crucibles with very small holes (∅~50 μm) or crucibles that can withstand very high pressures should be used.

===Sample condition===
The sample should be in good contact with the crucible surface. Therefore, the contact surface of a solid bulk sample should be plane parallel. For DSC measurements with powders, stronger signal might be observed for finer powders due to the enlarged contact surface. The minimum sample mass depends on the transformation to be analyzed. A small sample mass (~10 mg) is sufficient if the released or consumed heat during the transformation is high enough. Heavier samples could be used to obtain transformation associated with low heat release or consumption, as larger samples also enlarge the obtained peaks. However, the increasing sample size might worsen the resolution due to thermal gradients which may evolve during heating.

===Temperature and scan rates===
If the peaks are very small, it is possible to enlarge them by increasing the scan rate. Due to the faster scan rate, more energy is released or consumed in a shorter time which leads to higher and therefore more distinct peaks. However, faster scan rates lead to poor temperature resolution because of thermal lag. Due to this thermal lag, two phase transformations (or chemical reactions) occurring in a narrow temperature range might overlap. Generally, heating or cooling rates are too high to detect equilibrium transitions, so there is always a shift to higher or lower temperatures compared to phase diagrams representing equilibrium conditions.

===Purge gas===
Purge gas is used to control the sample environment, in order to reduce signal noise and to prevent contamination. Mostly nitrogen is used and for temperatures above 600 °C, argon can be utilized to minimize heat loss due to the low thermal conductivity of argon. Air or pure oxygen can be used for oxidative tests like oxidative induction time and He is used for very low temperatures due to the low boiling temperature (~4.2K at 101.325 kPa ).

==Examples==
The technique is widely used across a range of applications, both as a routine quality test and as a research tool. The equipment is easy to calibrate, using low melting indium at 156.5985 °C for example, and is a rapid and reliable method of thermal analysis.

===Polymers===

DSC is used widely for examining polymeric materials to determine their thermal transitions. Important thermal transitions include the glass transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;g), crystallization temperature (&quot;T&quot;c), and melting temperature (&quot;T&quot;m). The observed thermal transitions can be utilized to compare materials, although the transitions alone do not uniquely identify composition. The composition of unknown materials may be completed using complementary techniques such as IR spectroscopy. Melting points and glass transition temperatures for most polymers are available from standard compilations, and the method can show polymer degradation by the lowering of the expected melting temperature. &quot;Tm&quot; depends on the molecular weight of the polymer and thermal history.

The percent crystalline content of a polymer can be estimated from the crystallization/melting peaks of the DSC graph using reference heats of fusion found in the literature. DSC can also be used to study thermal degradation of polymers using an approach such as Oxidative Onset Temperature/Time (OOT); however, the user risks contamination of the DSC cell, which can be problematic. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) may be more useful for decomposition behavior determination. Impurities in polymers can be determined by examining thermograms for anomalous peaks, and plasticisers can be detected at their characteristic boiling points. In addition, examination of minor events in first heat thermal analysis data can be useful as these apparently &quot;anomalous peaks&quot; can in fact also be representative of process or storage thermal history of the material or polymer physical aging. Comparison of first and second heat data collected at consistent heating rates can allow the analyst to learn about both polymer processing history and material properties. (see &quot;J.H.Flynn.(1993) Analysis of DSC results by integration. Thermochimica Acta, 217, 129-149.)&quot; 

===Liquid crystals===
DSC is used in the study of liquid crystals. As some forms of matter go from solid to liquid they go through a third state, which displays properties of both phases. This anisotropic liquid is known as a liquid crystalline or mesomorphous state. Using DSC, it is possible to observe the small energy changes that occur as matter transitions from a solid to a liquid crystal and from a liquid crystal to an isotropic liquid.

===Oxidative stability===
Using differential scanning calorimetry to study the stability to oxidation of samples generally requires an airtight sample chamber. It can be used to determine the oxidative-induction time (OIT) of a sample. Such tests are usually done isothermally (at constant temperature) by changing the atmosphere of the sample. First, the sample is brought to the desired test temperature under an inert atmosphere, usually nitrogen. Oxygen is then added to the system. Any oxidation that occurs is observed as a deviation in the baseline. Such analysis can be used to determine the stability and optimum storage conditions for a material or compound. DSC equipment can also be used to determine the Oxidative-Onset Temperature (OOT) of a material. In this test a sample (and a reference) are exposed to an oxygen atmosphere and subjected to a constant rate of heating (typically from 50 to 300 °C). The DSC heat flow curve will deviate when the reaction with oxygen begins (the reaction being either exothermic or endothermic). Both OIT and OOT tests are used as a tools for determining the activity of antioxidants.

===Safety screening===
DSC makes a reasonable initial safety screening tool. In this mode the sample will be housed in a non-reactive crucible (often gold or gold-plated steel), and which will be able to withstand pressure (typically up to 100 bar). The presence of an exothermic event can then be used to assess the stability of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2–3 °C/min, due to much heavier crucible) and unknown activation energy, it is necessary to deduct about 75–100 °C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to &quot;suggest&quot; a maximal temperature for the material. A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an adiabatic calorimeter, but such a test may take 2–3 days from ambient at a rate of a 3 °C increment per half-hour.

===Drug analysis===
DSC is widely used in the pharmaceutical and polymer industries. For the polymer chemist, DSC is a handy tool for studying curing processes, which allows the fine tuning of polymer properties. The cross-linking of polymer molecules that occurs in the curing process is exothermic, resulting in a negative peak in the DSC curve that usually appears soon after the glass transition.

In the pharmaceutical industry it is necessary to have well-characterized drug compounds in order to define processing parameters. For instance, if it is necessary to deliver a drug in the amorphous form, it is desirable to process the drug at temperatures below those at which crystallization can occur.

===General chemical analysis===
Freezing-point depression can be used as a purity analysis tool when analysed by differential scanning calorimetry. This is possible because the temperature range over which a mixture of compounds melts is dependent on their relative amounts. Consequently, less pure compounds will exhibit a broadened melting peak that begins at lower temperature than a pure compound.

<text>Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is an experimental technique that uses elastic neutron scattering at small scattering angles to investigate the structure of various substances at a mesoscopic scale of about 1–100 nm.

Small angle neutron scattering is in many respects very similar to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS); both techniques are jointly referred to as small-angle scattering (SAS). The most important feature of the SAS method is its potential for analyzing the inner structure of disordered systems, and frequently the application of this method is a unique way to obtain direct structural information on systems with random arrangement of density inhomogeneities in such large-scales. Advantages of SANS over SAXS are its sensitivity to light elements, the possibility of isotope labelling, and the strong scattering by magnetic moments.

==Technique==
During a SANS experiment a beam of neutrons is directed at a sample, which can be an aqueous solution, a solid, a powder, or a crystal. The neutrons are elastically scattered by nuclear interaction with the nuclei or interaction with magnetic momentum of unpaired electrons. In X-ray scattering, photons interact with the electronic cloud so the bigger the element, the bigger the effect is. In neutron scattering, neutrons interact with nuclei and the interaction depends on the isotope; some light elements like deuterium show similar scattering cross section as heavy elements like Pb.

In zero order dynamical theory of diffraction the refractive index is directly related to the scattering length density and is a measure of the strength of the interaction of a neutron wave with a given nucleus. The following table shows the neutron scattering length for a few chemical elements (in 10−12 cm).

Note that the relative scale of the scattering lengths is the same. Another important point is that the scattering from hydrogen is distinct from that of deuterium. Also, hydrogen is one of the few elements that has a negative scattering length, which means that neutrons deflected from hydrogen are 180° out of phase relative to those deflected by the other elements. These features are important for the technique of contrast variation (see below).

=== Related techniques ===

SANS usually uses collimation of the neutron beam to determine the scattering angle of a neutron, which results in an ever lower signal-to-noise ratio for data that
contains information on the properties of a sample at relatively long length scales, beyond ~1 μm. The traditional solution is to increase the brightness of the source, as in Ultra Small Angle Neutron Scattering (USANS). As an alternative Spin-echo Small-angle Neutron Scattering (SESANS) was introduced, using neutron spin echo to track the scattering angle, and expanding the range of length scales which can be studied by neutron scattering to well beyond 10 μm.

Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISANS) combines ideas of SANS and of neutron reflectometry.

==In biology==
A crucial feature of SANS that makes it particularly useful for the biological sciences is the special behavior of hydrogen, especially compared to deuterium. In biological systems hydrogen can be exchanged with deuterium which usually has minimal effect on the sample but has dramatic effects on the scattering.

The technique of contrast variation (or contrast matching) relies on the differential scatter of hydrogen vs. deuterium. Figure 1 shows the scattering length density for water and various biological macromolecules as a function of the deuterium concentration. (Adapted from.) Biological samples are usually dissolved in water, so their hydrogens are able to exchange with any deuteriums in the solvent. Since the overall scatter of a molecule depends on the scatter of all its components, this will depend on the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium in the molecule. At certain ratios of H2O to D2O, called match points, the scatter from the molecule will equal that of the solvent, and thus be eliminated when the scatter from the buffer is subtracted from the data. For instance the match point for proteins is typically around 40–45% D2O, and at that concentration the scatter from the protein will be indistinguishable from that of the buffer.

To use contrast variation, different components of a system must scatter differently. This can be based on inherent scattering differences, e.g. DNA vs. protein, or arise from differentially labeled components, e.g. having one protein in a complex deuterated while the rest are protonated. In terms of modelling, small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data can be combined with the program MONSA. An example in which SAXS, SANS and EM data has been used to build an atomic model of a large multi-subunit enzyme has recently been published. For some examples of this method see.

For the study of large scales of matter (e.g. Soft matter) and slow dynamics, very cold neutrons (VCN) should be used. However, because of the weak neutron flux and lack of optical components in this range, most scientists use neutrons of shorter wavelengths. Efforts are being made to remedy this lack.

There are numerous SANS instruments available worldwide at neutron facilities such as research reactors or spallation sources.

<doc id="97921" wikidata="Q1300003" url="?curid=97921" title="St Davids Cathedral">
<text>St Davids Cathedral () is an Anglican cathedral situated in St Davids, Britain&#x27;s smallest city, in the county of Pembrokeshire, near the most westerly point of Wales.

==Early history==
The monastic community was founded by Saint David, Abbot of Menevia, who died in 589. Between 645 and 1097, the community was attacked many times by raiders, including the Vikings; however it was of such note as both a religious and an intellectual centre that King Alfred summoned help from the monastic community at St Davids in rebuilding the intellectual life of the Kingdom of Wessex. Many of the bishops were murdered by raiders and marauders, including Bishop Moregenau in 999 and Bishop Abraham in 1080. The stone that marked his grave, known as the &quot;Abraham Stone&quot;, is intricately carved with early Celtic symbols and is now on permanent display within the Cathedral Exhibition at Porth-y-Tŵr.

In 1081, William the Conqueror visited St Davids to pray, and thus recognised it as a holy and respected place. In 1089, the shrine of David was vandalised and stripped of its precious metals. In 1090, the Welsh scholar Rhigyfarch wrote his Latin &quot;Life of David&quot;, highlighting David&#x27;s sanctity, thus beginning the almost cult-like status he achieved.

In 1115, with the area under Norman control, King Henry I of England appointed Bishop Bernard as Bishop of St Davids. He began to improve life within the community, and commenced construction of a new cathedral. In 1123, Pope Calixtus II granted Bishop Bernard&#x27;s request to bestow a papal privilege upon St Davids, making it a centre of pilgrimage for the Western world; the Pope decreed that &quot;Two pilgrimages to St Davids is equal to one to Rome, and three pilgrimages to one to Jerusalem&quot;. The new cathedral was quickly constructed and Bishop Bernard consecrated it in 1131. Henry II of England&#x27;s visit in 1171 saw the following of David increase and the need for a larger cathedral.

The present cathedral was begun in 1181 and completed not long after. Problems beset the new building and the community in its infancy: the collapse of the new tower in 1220 and earthquake damage in 1247/48.
Under Bishop Gower (1328–1347) the cathedral was modified further, with the rood screen and the Bishops Palace intended as permanent reminders of his episcopacy; the palace is now a picturesque ruin.

In 1365, Bishop Adam Houghton and John of Gaunt began to build St Mary&#x27;s College and a chantry. He later added the cloister, which connects it to the cathedral.

The episcopacy of Edward Vaughan (1509–1522) saw the building of the Holy Trinity chapel, with its fan vaulting which some say inspired the roof of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. This period also saw great developments for the nave, whose roof and Irish oak ceiling were constructed between 1530 and 1540. Bishop Barlow, unlike his predecessor as bishop, wished to suppress the following of David, and stripped St David&#x27;s shrine of its jewels and confiscated the relics of St David and St Justinian in order to counteract &quot;superstition&quot; in 1538. In 1540, the body of Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond and father of Henry VII, was brought to be entombed in front of the high altar from the dissolved Greyfriars&#x27; Priory in Carmarthen.

The establishment of the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell greatly affected many cathedrals and churches, and was particularly felt in St Davids. The cathedral was all but destroyed by Cromwell&#x27;s forces and the lead was stripped from the Bishops Palace roof.

==Present cathedral==

There is a pronounced slope to the floor of the cathedral, amounting to a height difference of nearly four metres between the east and west ends, and the building is still shifting minutely.

The Welsh architect John Nash was commissioned to restore the west front in 1793 to repair the damage done two hundred years previously. Eclectic in style (with Gothic and Perpendicular characteristics – the latter attributed partly to his destruction of the windows of the chapel of St Mary&#x27;s College in order to reuse that tracery for his west front), his work soon proved to be substandard (as had his previous work on the chapter house). Within a century the Nash west front had become unstable and the whole building was restored by George Gilbert Scott between 1862 and 1870. The lady chapel was restored by public subscription in 1901 and the eastern chapels were restored through a legacy of the Countess of Maidstone, granddaughter of Bishop John Jenkinson, between 1901 and 1910.

The cathedral suffered the pains of disestablishment in 1920, as did the whole Church in Wales. The diocese was made smaller by the removal of the Archdeaconry of Brecon to form the new Diocese of Swansea and Brecon in 1923. However, this left a large area as a diocese to govern and St Davids began to deteriorate as the centre of the diocese, being nowhere near the centre – the bishop&#x27;s residence had been at Carmarthen since the 16th century, but administration and the focus moved from the cathedral to the diocese&#x27;s now largest town.

The 1950s saw the appointment of the Reverend Carl Witton-Davies as dean; appointed in his thirties, his driving vision and energy was short-lived as he was offered what some was believed as a preferment as Archdeacon of Oxford, but did not leave that position for the rest of his service in the church. The cathedral began to have life again and the famous Welsh Youth Pilgrimages to St Davids (Cymry&#x27;r Groes) led many to a life of service in the church and provided the Church in Wales with inspired clergy for a decade following. It was Grade I-listed by Cadw in 1951.

The 1960s saw the restoration of St Mary&#x27;s College as the cathedral hall, for the use of the cathedral parish and for use as an area for art exhibitions and poetry readings. It was dedicated by Archbishop Edwin Morris in 1966 and the inaugural event was a poetry reading by the poet R. S. Thomas, who served as a vicar in the Bangor diocese.

During the 1980s a number of official events in cathedral life took place: in 1981, Charles, Prince of Wales, visited to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the consecration of the cathedral; and on Maundy Thursday 1982, Queen Elizabeth II distributed the Royal Maundy at the cathedral. This was the first occasion that the ceremony had taken place outside England. In 1989–90, the 1,400th anniversary of the death of St David was presided over by the Archbishop of Wales, George Noakes, who was also diocesan Bishop of St Davids.

The decades leading to and immediately following the year 2000 have been the most notable in the cathedral&#x27;s history since its construction. First, the British Government decided to reinstate the title of &quot;city&quot; to St Davids and this was formally conferred by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 June 1995. The task that lay before the dean, the Very Reverend Wyn Evans, on his appointment in 1994 was huge: a new organ was badly needed and the west front needed extensive restoration. It was also thought to be time for the cathedral to invest in its future by creating a visitor centre within the bell tower, enlarging the peal of bells from eight to ten and by the &quot;reconstruction&quot;, or completion, of the cathedral cloisters to house the cathedral choir, vestries, an education suite, rooms for parish use and a refectory as a reminder of the monastic beginnings. The first project was the restoration of the west front, with the original quarry that was used for stone at Caerbwdi Bay being reopened. This phase was completed in 1998, in time for the organ to be dismantled and rebuilt by the organ builders Harrison and Harrison of Durham. The organ was completed in the middle months of 2000 and dedicated on 15 October that year.

The ring of bells was cast by Whitechapel Bell Foundry of London and presented as a gift by the American Friends of St Davids Cathedral. The substantial task of rebuilding the cloisters as an education centre and refectory began in 2003 and was completed in May 2007. The translation of Wyn Evans from dean to bishop led to the appointment of Jonathan Lean as dean in 2009.

The bells are not hung in the central tower of the cathedral but in the old gatehouse, Porth y Twr. There are 10 bells, with the heaviest weighing in D. The back eight bells were cast in 1928 by Mears &amp; Stainbank, London and two trebles added in 2000 cast by Whitechapel Bell Foundry, London.

The restored Shrine of St David was unveiled and re-dedicated by the Right Reverend Wyn Evans, Bishop of St Davids, at a Choral Eucharist on St Davids Day 2012.

==Cathedral Hall and cloisters==
St Davids Cathedral Hall stands to the north of the nave and was originally the chapel of St Mary&#x27;s College. It was restored by Alban Caroe in 1966. The cloister complex lies to the north of the hall and comprises a number of buildings, including Cloister Hall, which were built over the undercrofts of the 14th century St Mary&#x27;s College. The undercrofts are a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled monument. Cloister Hall which dates from the early 19th century is also Grade I listed, as are an outbuilding and a wall with an inset gateway, both of which lie to the north of the hall. The gateway has a Tudorbethan arch but is likely also 19th century in date. Following an earlier refurbishment of the cloister complex in the 1960s, in 2004 the firm of Caroe &amp; Partners led a major reconstruction. The partnership have been the cathedral&#x27;s architects since the appointment of the firm&#x27;s founder, W. D. Caröe, in 1907. The builders were Carreg Construction. The rebuilding provided facilities for meetings, educational and outreach work, retreat spaces and a café.

==Cathedral life==

There are at least three services said or sung per day, each week, with sung services on five out of seven days.

The cathedral choir at St Davids was the first cathedral choir in the United Kingdom to use girls and men as the main choir, rather than boys and men. (Salisbury Cathedral introduced boys and girls earlier on an equal basis, whereas St Davids uses girls as their &quot;main&quot; cathedral choristers.) There is also a boys&#x27; choir whose weekly Evensong is a major event within the cathedral week. They sing with the vicars choral regularly.

The St Davids Cathedral Festival runs through the Whitsun school holiday each year and showcases some of the world&#x27;s best performers. The week sees performers, both professional and young, play in front of thousands. The cathedral choir serve as a highlight each year, being a very popular concert, as well as the Festival Chorus and Orchestra who perform a major work on the final night of the festival.

==List of deans==
Before 1840 the senior residentiary cleric was the precentor and not a dean due to a complication during the dissolution of the monasteries. Since 1840 the title &quot;Dean&quot; has been appended to that of Precentor, hence the deans of St Davids are formally the &quot;Dean and Precentor&quot; and their seat being on what is normally regarded in most places the &quot;cantoris&quot; side, with a stall &quot;in quire&quot; reserved for the bishop.

*2018–present Sarah Rowland Jones

Sarah Caroline Rowland Jones (born 8 September 1959, Stoke-on-Trent) was instituted as Dean of St Davids on 5 May 2018. Having served in the Diplomatic Service, she trained for the ministry at St John&#x27;s College, Nottingham; she was then made deacon at Petertide 1999 (26 June) and ordained priest the following Petertide (24 June 2000) — both times by Alwyn Rice Jones, Bishop of St Asaph and Archbishop of Wales, at St Asaph Cathedral. She served in South Africa, 2003–2013 (where she also married Justus Marcus, late Regional Bishop of Saldanha Bay, Diocese of Cape Town), then returned to Wales as Priest-in-Charge of St John the Baptist Church, Cardiff until her appointment to the Deanery.

==Local legends==
Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis) in the 13th century relates the strange story of a marble footbridge leading from the church over the Alun rivulet in St Davids. The marble stone was called &quot;Llechllafar&quot; (&quot;the talking stone&quot;) because it once spoke when a corpse was carried over it to the cemetery for interment. The effort of speech had caused it to break, despite its size of ten feet in length, six in breadth and one in thickness. This bridge was worn smooth due to its age and the thousands of people who had walked over it, however the superstition was so great that corpses were no longer carried over it. This ancient bridge was replaced in the 16th century and its present whereabouts are not known.

Another legend is that Merlin had prophesied the death on Llechllafar of an English king, conqueror of Ireland, who had been injured by a man with a red hand. King Henry II, whilst on a pilgrimage to Saint Davids, having come over from Ireland, heard of the prophecy and crossed Llechllafar without ill effect. He boasted that Merlin was a liar, to which a bystander replied that the King would not conquer Ireland and was therefore not the king of the prophecy. This turned out to be true, for Henry never did conquer the whole of Ireland.

==Burials==
*Rhys ap Gruffydd
*Gerald of Wales
*Thomas Fastolf
*Adam Houghton
*Edward Vaughan (bishop)
*Benedict Nichols
*Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond (father of Henry VII)

==Organ==
A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

==In popular culture==
The cathedral&#x27;s exterior and overall design were used as the basis of the fictional Nemeton monastery in the video game &quot;Koudelka&quot; and its sequels &quot;Shadow Hearts&quot; and &quot;Shadow Hearts: Covenant&quot;.

<doc id="97922" wikidata="Q1070689" url="?curid=97922" title="Digital image processing">
<text>Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more), digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems. The generation and development of digital image processing are mainly affected by three factors: first, the development of computers; second, the development of mathematics (especially the creation and improvement of discrete mathematics theory); and third, the demand for a wide range of applications in environment, agriculture, military, industry and medical science has increased.

==History==
Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture processing as it often was called, were developed in the 1960s, at Bell Laboratories, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Maryland, and a few other research facilities, with application to satellite imagery, wire-photo standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character recognition, and photograph enhancement. The purpose of early image processing was to improve the quality of the image. It was aimed for human beings to improve the visual effect of people. In image processing, the input is a low-quality image, and the output is an image with improved quality. Common image processing include image enhancement, restoration, encoding, and compression. The first successful application was the American Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). They used image processing techniques such as geometric correction, gradation transformation, noise removal, etc. on the thousands of lunar photos sent back by the Space Detector Ranger 7 in 1964, taking into account the position of the Sun and the environment of the Moon. The impact of the successful mapping of the Moon&#x27;s surface map by the computer has been a success. Later, more complex image processing was performed on the nearly 100,000 photos sent back by the spacecraft, so that the topographic map, color map and panoramic mosaic of the Moon were obtained, which achieved extraordinary results and laid a solid foundation for human landing on the Moon.

The cost of processing was fairly high, however, with the computing equipment of that era. That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became available. This led to images being processed in real-time, for some dedicated problems such as television standards conversion. As general-purpose computers became faster, they started to take over the role of dedicated hardware for all but the most specialized and computer-intensive operations. With the fast computers and signal processors available in the 2000s, digital image processing has become the most common form of image processing, and is generally used because it is not only the most versatile method, but also the cheapest.

===Image sensors===
The basis for modern image sensors is metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology, invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960, This led to the development of digital semiconductor image sensors, including the charge-coupled device (CCD) and later the CMOS sensor.

The charge-coupled device was invented by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969. While researching MOS technology, they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor. As it was fairly straightforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row, they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next. The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting.

The NMOS active-pixel sensor (APS) was invented by Olympus in Japan during the mid-1980s. This was enabled by advances in MOS semiconductor device fabrication, with MOSFET scaling reaching smaller micron and then sub-micron levels. The NMOS APS was fabricated by Tsutomu Nakamura&#x27;s team at Olympus in 1985. The CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) was later developed by Eric Fossum&#x27;s team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993. By 2007, sales of CMOS sensors had surpassed CCD sensors.

MOS image sensors are widely used in optical mouse technology. The first optical mouse, invented by Richard F. Lyon at Xerox in 1980, used a 5μm NMOS integrated circuit sensor chip. Since the first commercial optical mouse, the IntelliMouse introduced in 1999, most optical mouse devices use CMOS sensors.

===Image compression===
An important development in digital image compression technology was the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972. DCT compression became the basis for JPEG, which was introduced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group in 1992. JPEG compresses images down to much smaller file sizes, and has become the most widely used image file format on the Internet. Its highly efficient DCT compression algorithm was largely responsible for the wide proliferation of digital images and digital photos, with several billion JPEG images produced every day .

Medical imaging techniques produce very large amounts of data, especially from CT, MRI and PET modalities. As a result, storage and communications of electronic image data are prohibitive without the use of compression. JPEG 2000 image compression is used by the DICOM standard for storage and transmission of medical images. The cost and feasibility of accessing large image data sets over low or various bandwidths are further addressed by use of another DICOM standard, called JPIP, to enable efficient streaming of the JPEG 2000 compressed image data.

===Digital signal processor (DSP)===
Electronic signal processing was revolutionized by the wide adoption of MOS technology in the 1970s. MOS integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single-chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early 1970s, and then the first single-chip digital signal processor (DSP) chips in the late 1970s. DSP chips have since been widely used in digital image processing.

The discrete cosine transform (DCT) image compression algorithm has been widely implemented in DSP chips, with many companies developing DSP chips based on DCT technology. DCTs are widely used for encoding, decoding, video coding, audio coding, multiplexing, control signals, signaling, analog-to-digital conversion, formatting luminance and color differences, and color formats such as YUV444 and YUV411. DCTs are also used for encoding operations such as motion estimation, motion compensation, inter-frame prediction, quantization, perceptual weighting, entropy encoding, variable encoding, and motion vectors, and decoding operations such as the inverse operation between different color formats (YIQ, YUV and RGB) for display purposes. DCTs are also commonly used for high-definition television (HDTV) encoder/decoder chips.

===Medical imaging===
In 1972, engineer Godfrey Hounsfield from the British company EMI invented the X-ray computed tomography (CT) device for head diagnosis, which is commonly referred to as CT (computed tomography). The CT nucleus method is based on the projecting X-rays through a section of the human head, which are then processed by computer to reconstruct the cross-sectional image, known as image reconstruction. In 1975, EMI successfully developed a CT device for the entire body, enabling the clear acquisition of tomographic images of various parts of the human body. This revolutionary diagnostic technique earned Hounsfield and physicist Allan Cormack the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1979. Digital image processing technology for medical applications was inducted into the Space Foundation&#x27;s Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1994. 

By 2010, over 5 billion medical imaging studies had been conducted worldwide. Radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 accounted for about 50% of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States. Medical imaging equipment is manufactured using technology from the semiconductor industry, including CMOS integrated circuit chips, power semiconductor devices, sensors such as image sensors (particularly CMOS sensors) and biosensors, as well as processors like microcontrollers, microprocessors, digital signal processors, media processors and system-on-chip devices. , annual shipments of medical imaging chips reached 46 million units, generating a market value of .

==Tasks==
Digital image processing allows the use of much more complex algorithms, and hence, can offer both more sophisticated performance at simple tasks, and the implementation of methods which would be impossible by analogue means.

In particular, digital image processing is a concrete application of, and a practical technology based on:
* Classification
* Feature extraction
* Multi-scale signal analysis
* Pattern recognition
* Projection

Some techniques which are used in digital image processing include:
* Anisotropic diffusion
* Hidden Markov models
* Image editing
* Image restoration
* Independent component analysis
* Linear filtering
* Neural networks
* Partial differential equations
* Pixelation
* Point feature matching
* Principal components analysis
* Self-organizing maps
* Wavelets

== Digital image transformations ==

=== Filtering ===
Digital filters are used to blur and sharpen digital images. Filtering can be performed by:
* convolution with specifically designed kernels (filter array) in the spatial domain
* masking specific frequency regions in the frequency (Fourier) domain

The following examples show both methods:

==== Image padding in Fourier domain filtering ====

Images are typically padded before being transformed to the Fourier space, the highpass filtered images below illustrate the consequences of different padding techniques:

Notice that the highpass filter shows extra edges when zero padded compared to the repeated edge padding.

==== Filtering code examples ====

X=conv2(img,klaplace); % convolve test img with
 % 3x3 Laplacian kernel

=== Affine transformations ===
Affine transformations enable basic image transformations including scale, rotate, translate, mirror and shear as is shown in the following examples:
To apply the affine matrix to an image, the image is converted to matrix in which each entry corresponds to the pixel intensity at that location. Then each pixel&#x27;s location can be represented as a vector indicating the coordinates of that pixel in the image, , where and are the row and column of a pixel in the image matrix. This allows the coordinate to be multiplied by an affine-transformation matrix, which gives the position that the pixel value will be copied to in the output image.

However, to allow transformations that require translation transformations, 3-dimensional homogeneous coordinates are needed. The third dimension is usually set to a non-zero constant, usually , so that the new coordinate is . This allows the coordinate vector to be multiplied by a 3×3 matrix, enabling translation shifts. Thus, the third dimension, i.e. the constant , allows translation.

Because matrix multiplication is associative, multiple affine transformations can be combined into a single affine transformation by multiplying the matrix of each individual transformation in the order that the transformations are done. This results in a single matrix that, when applied to a point vector, gives the same result as all the individual transformations performed on the vector in sequence. Thus a sequence of affine transformation matrices can be reduced to a single affine transformation matrix.

For example, 2-dimensional coordinates only permit rotation about the origin . But 3-dimensional homogeneous coordinates can be used to first translate any point to , then perform the rotation, and lastly translate the origin back to the original point (the opposite of the first translation). These three affine transformations can be combined into a single matrix—thus allowing rotation around any point in the image.

=== Image denoising with mathematical morphology ===
Mathematical morphology (MM) is useful for denoising images by applying structuring elements. Suppose we have the following:

* An image: formula_1

* A structuring element: formula_2
; Dilation : Dilation is defined as:
formula_3
:For example, the dilation at position is calculated as:
formula_4

; Erosion : Erosion is defined as:
formula_5
:For example, the erosion at position is calculated as:
formula_6

==== Results ====

After applying dilation to :
formula_7

After applying erosion to :
formula_8

==== Opening and Closing ====

MM operations, such as opening and closing, are composite processes that utilize both dilation and erosion to modify the structure of an image. These operations are particularly useful for tasks such as noise removal, shape smoothing, and object separation.

* &quot;Opening&quot;: This operation is performed by applying erosion to an image first, followed by dilation. The purpose of opening is to remove small objects or noise from the foreground while preserving the overall structure of larger objects. It is especially effective in situations where noise appears as isolated bright pixels or small, disconnected features.

For example, applying opening to an image with a structuring element would first reduce small details (through erosion) and then restore the main shapes (through dilation). This ensures that unwanted noise is removed without significantly altering the size or shape of larger objects.

* &quot;Closing&quot;: This operation is performed by applying dilation first, followed by erosion. Closing is typically used to fill small holes or gaps within objects and to connect broken parts of the foreground. It works by initially expanding the boundaries of objects (through dilation) and then refining the boundaries (through erosion).
For instance, applying closing to the same image would fill in small gaps within objects, such as connecting breaks in thin lines or closing small holes, while ensuring that the surrounding areas are not significantly affected.

Both opening and closing can be visualized as ways of refining the structure of an image: opening simplifies and removes small, unnecessary details, while closing consolidates and connects objects to form more cohesive structures.

==Applications==
===Digital camera images===
Digital cameras generally include specialized digital image processing hardware – either dedicated chips or added circuitry on other chips – to convert the raw data from their image sensor into a color-corrected image in a standard image file format. Additional post processing techniques increase edge sharpness or color saturation to create more naturally looking images.

===Film===
&quot;Westworld&quot; (1973) was the first feature film to use the digital image processing to pixellate photography to simulate an android&#x27;s point of view. Image processing is also vastly used to produce the chroma key effect that replaces the background of actors with natural or artistic scenery.

===Face detection===

Face detection can be implemented with mathematical morphology, the discrete cosine transform (DCT), and horizontal projection.

General method with feature-based method

The feature-based method of face detection is using skin tone, edge detection, face shape, and feature of a face (like eyes, mouth, etc.) to achieve face detection. The skin tone, face shape, and all the unique elements that only the human face have can be described as features.

Process explanation

# Given a batch of face images, first, extract the skin tone range by sampling face images. The skin tone range is just a skin filter.
## Structural similarity index measure (SSIM) can be applied to compare images in terms of extracting the skin tone.
## Normally, HSV or RGB color spaces are suitable for the skin filter. E.g. HSV mode, the skin tone range is [0,48,50] ~ [20,255,255]
# After filtering images with skin tone, to get the face edge, morphology and DCT are used to remove noise and fill up missing skin areas.
## Opening method or closing method can be used to achieve filling up missing skin.
## DCT is to avoid the object with skin-like tone. Since human faces always have higher texture.
## Sobel operator or other operators can be applied to detect face edge.
# To position human features like eyes, using the projection and find the peak of the histogram of projection help to get the detail feature like mouth, hair, and lip.
## Projection is just projecting the image to see the high frequency which is usually the feature position.

===Improvement of image quality method===

Image quality can be influenced by camera vibration, over-exposure, gray level distribution too centralized, and noise, etc. For example, noise problem can be solved by smoothing method while gray level distribution problem can be improved by histogram equalization.

Smoothing method

In drawing, if there is some dissatisfied color, taking some color around dissatisfied color and averaging them. This is an easy way to think of Smoothing method.

Smoothing method can be implemented with mask and convolution. Take the small image and mask for instance as below.

image is
formula_9

mask is formula_10

After convolution and smoothing, image is
formula_11

Observing image[1, 1], image[1, 2], image[2, 1], and image[2, 2].

The original image pixel is 1, 4, 28, 30. After smoothing mask, the pixel becomes 9, 10, 9, 9 respectively.

new image[1, 1] = formula_12 * (image[0,0]+image[0,1]+image[0,2]+image[1,0]+image[1,1]+image[1,2]+image[2,0]+image[2,1]+image[2,2])

new image[1, 1] = floor(formula_12 * (2+5+6+3+1+4+1+28+30)) = 9

new image[1, 2] = floor({formula_12 * (5+6+5+1+4+6+28+30+2)) = 10

new image[2, 1] = floor(formula_12 * (3+1+4+1+28+30+7+3+2)) = 9

new image[2, 2] = floor(formula_12 * (1+4+6+28+30+2+3+2+2)) = 9

Gray Level Histogram method

Generally, given a gray level histogram from an image as below. Changing the histogram to uniform distribution from an image is usually what we called histogram equalization.

In discrete time, the area of gray level histogram is formula_17(see figure 1) while the area of uniform distribution is formula_18(see figure 2). It is clear that the area will not change, so formula_19.

From the uniform distribution, the probability of formula_20 is formula_21 while the formula_22

In continuous time, the equation is formula_23.

Moreover, based on the definition of a function, the Gray level histogram method is like finding a function formula_24 that satisfies f(p)=q.

== Challenges ==

# Noise and Distortions: Imperfections in images due to poor lighting, limited sensors, and file compression can result in unclear images that impact accurate image conversion.
# Variability in Image Quality: Variations in image quality and resolution, including blurry images and incomplete details, can hinder uniform processing across a database.
# Object Detection and Recognition: Identifying and recognising objects within images, especially in complex scenarios with multiple objects and occlusions, poses a significant challenge.
# Data Annotation and Labelling: Labelling diverse and multiple images for machine recognition is crucial for further processing accuracy, as incorrect identification can lead to unrealistic results.
# Computational Resource Intensity: Accessing adequate computational resources for image processing can be challenging and costly, hindering progress without sufficient resources.
