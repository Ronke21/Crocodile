<text>Freiburg im Breisgau (; ; Alemannic: &quot;Friburg im Brisgau&quot;; ; &quot;Freecastle in the Breisgau&quot;; mostly called simply Freiburg) is the fourth-largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg after Stuttgart, Mannheim and Karlsruhe. Its built-up area has a population of about 355,000 (2021), while the greater Freiburg metropolitan area (&quot;Einzugsgebiet&quot;) has about 660,000 (2018).

Freiburg is located at the southwestern foothills of the Black Forest, on the Dreisam River, a tributary of the Elz. It is Germany&#x27;s southwestern- and southernmost city with a population exceeding 100,000. It lies in the Breisgau, one of Germany&#x27;s warmest regions, in the south of the Upper Rhine Plain. Its city limits reach from the Schauinsland summit () in the Black Forest to east of the French border, while Switzerland is to the south. The city is situated in the major wine-growing region of Baden and, together with Offenburg, serves as a tourist entry-point to the scenic Black Forest. According to meteorological statistics, Freiburg held the all-time German temperature record of from 2003 to 2015.

An old university town and archiepiscopal seat, it was incorporated in the early 12th century and soon became a commercial, intellectual and ecclesiastical center for the Upper Rhine region. The University of Freiburg (&quot;Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg&quot;), founded in 1457, is one of Germany&#x27;s oldest universities. Freiburg&#x27;s main landmark is the Freiburg Minster (&quot;Freiburger Münster&quot;), which was built between c. 1200 and 1513 and has been described as &quot;Gothic architectural masterpiece&quot;.

The old town is traversed by an extensive system of runnels called Bächle ( &quot;small streams&quot;), that are fed with water from the Dreisam and run on the side of almost all streets and alleys, giving the city a unique touch. Freiburg has a high standard of living, and is known for its advanced environmental practices, which is embodied by local housing projects such as the creation of the sustainable district of Vauban.

The dialect spoken in Freiburg is classified as (Upper Rhenish) Low Alemannic, and therefore most closely related to the other dialects of Baden north of Markgräflerland and south of Karlsruhe, to most dialects historically spoken in Alsace (Alsatian), and to Basel German.

==History==

Freiburg was founded by Konrad and Duke Berthold III of the House of Zähringen in 1120 as a free market town; hence its name, which translates to &quot;free (or independent) town&quot;. &quot;Frei&quot; means &quot;free&quot;, and &quot;Burg&quot;, like the modern English word &quot;borough&quot;, was used in those days for an incorporated city or town, usually one with some degree of autonomy. The German word &quot;Burg&quot; also means &quot;a fortified town&quot;, as in Hamburg. Thus, it is likely that the name of this place means a &quot;fortified town of free citizens&quot;.

This town was strategically located at a junction of trade routes between the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea regions, and the Rhine and Danube rivers. In 1200, Freiburg&#x27;s population numbered approximately 6,000 people. At about that time, under the rule of Bertold V, the last duke of Zähringen, the city began construction of its Freiburg Minster cathedral on the site of an older parish church. Begun in the Romanesque style, it was continued and completed 1513 for the most part as a Gothic edifice. In 1218, when Bertold V died, then Egino V von Urach, the count of Urach assumed the title of Freiburg&#x27;s count as Egino I von Freiburg. The city council did not trust the new nobles and wrote down its established rights in a document. At the end of the thirteenth century there was a feud between the citizens of Freiburg and their lord, Count Egino II of Freiburg. Egino II raised taxes and sought to limit the citizens&#x27; freedom, after which the Freiburgers used catapults to destroy the count&#x27;s castle atop the Schloßberg, a hill that overlooks the city center. The furious count called on his brother-in-law the Prince-Bishopric of Strasbourg, Conrad of Lichtenberg, for help. The bishop responded by marching with his army to Freiburg.

According to an old Freiburg legend, a butcher named Hauri stabbed the Bishop of Strasbourg to death on 29 July 1299. It was a Pyrrhic victory, since henceforth the citizens of Freiburg had to pay an annual expiation of 300 marks in silver to the count of Freiburg until 1368. In 1366 the counts of Freiburg made another failed attempt to occupy the city during a night raid. Eventually the citizens were fed up with their lords, and in 1368 Freiburg purchased its independence from them. The city turned itself over to the protection of the Habsburgs, who allowed the city to retain a large measure of freedom. Most of the nobles of the city died in the battle of Sempach (1386). The patrician family Schnewlin took control of the city until the guildsmen revolted. The guilds became more powerful than the patricians by 1389.

The silver mines in Mount Schauinsland provided an important source of capital for Freiburg. This silver made Freiburg one of the richest cities in Europe, and in 1327 Freiburg minted its own coin, the &quot;Rappenpfennig&quot;. In 1377 the cities of Freiburg, Basel, Colmar, and Breisach entered into a monetary alliance known as the &quot;Genossenschaft des Rappenpfennigs&quot; (Rappenpfennig Collective). This alliance facilitated commerce among the cities and lasted until the end of the sixteenth century. There were 8,000–9,000 people living in Freiburg between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and 30 churches and monasteries. At the end of the fourteenth century the veins of silver were dwindling, and by 1460 only approximately 6,000 people still lived within Freiburg&#x27;s city walls.

A university city, Freiburg evolved from its focus on mining to become a cultural centre for the arts and sciences. It was also a commercial center. The end of the Middle Ages and the dawn of the Renaissance was a time of both advances and tragedy for Freiburg.

In 1457, Albrecht VI, Regent of Further Austria, established Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, one of Germany&#x27;s oldest universities. In 1498, Emperor Maximilian I held a Reichstag in Freiburg. In 1520, the city ratified a set of legal reforms, widely considered the most progressive of the time. The aim was to find a balance between city traditions and old Roman Law. The reforms were well received, especially the sections dealing with civil process law, punishment, and the city&#x27;s constitution.

In 1520, Freiburg decided not to take part in the Reformation and became an important centre for Catholicism on the Upper Rhine. Erasmus moved here after Basel accepted the Reformation. In 1536, a strong and persistent belief in witchcraft led to the city&#x27;s first witch-hunt. The need to find a scapegoat for calamities such as the Black Plague, which claimed 2,000 area residents (25% of the city population) in 1564, led to an escalation in witch-hunting that reached its peak in 1599. A plaque on the old city wall marks the spot where burnings were carried out.

The seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries were turbulent times for Freiburg. At the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1618, its population numbered between 10,000 to 14,000; when it ended in 1648, only 2,000 remained. In August 1644, it was the site of the Battle of Freiburg, said to be the bloodiest battle of the war in terms of percentage of casualties. 

Between 1648 and 1805, when the city was not under French occupation it was the administrative headquarters of Further Austria, the Habsburg territories in the southwest of Germany. In 1805, the city, together with the Breisgau and Ortenau areas, became part of Baden. In 1827, when the Archdiocese of Freiburg was founded, Freiburg became the seat of a Catholic archbishop.

Freiburg was heavily bombed during World War II. In May 1940, aircraft of the Luftwaffe mistakenly dropped approximately 60 bombs on Freiburg near the railway station, killing 57 people, most of them civilians and including 22 children. This was reported by the official German news agency as an attack by the Western Allies, and retaliation against them was threatened. The Freiburg police commander subsequently established that the bombs were German, but the full story was not published until many years later. On 27 November 1944, a raid by more than 300 bombers of RAF Bomber Command (Operation Tigerfish) destroyed a large portion of the city centre, with the notable exception of the &quot;Münster&quot;, which was only lightly damaged. After the war, the city was rebuilt on its medieval plan.

On 22 October 1940, the Nazi Gauleiter of Baden, Robert Heinrich Wagner, ordered the deportation of all of Baden&#x27;s and 350 of Freiburg&#x27;s Jewish population. They were deported to Camp Gurs in the south of France, where many died. On 18 July 1942, the remaining Baden and Freiburg Jews were transferred to Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland, where almost all were murdered. A living memorial has been created in the form of the &#x27;footprint&#x27; in marble on the site of the city&#x27;s original synagogue, which was burned down on 9 November 1938, during the pogrom known as &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. The memorial is a fountain and contains a bronze plaque commemorating the original building and the Jewish community which perished. The pavements of Freiburg carry memorials to individual victims, in the form of brass plates outside their former residences. There was a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;) in the city.

It was occupied by the French Army on 21 April 1945, and Freiburg was soon allotted to the French Zone of Occupation. In December 1945 Freiburg became the seat of government for the German state of Baden, which was merged into Baden-Württemberg in 1952. The French Army maintained a presence in Freiburg until 1991, when the last French Army division left the city, and left Germany.

On the site of the former French Army base, a new neighborhood for 5,000 people, Vauban, began in the late 1990s as a &quot;sustainable model district&quot;. Solar power provides electricity to many of the households in this small community.

==Points of interest==
Because of its scenic beauty, relatively warm and sunny climate, and easy access to the Black Forest, Freiburg is a hub for regional tourism. In 2010, Freiburg was voted as the Academy of Urbanism&#x27;s European City of the Year in recognition of the exemplary sustainable urbanism it has implemented over the past several decades.

The longest cable car run in Germany, which is long, runs from Günterstal up to a nearby mountain called &quot;Schauinsland&quot;.

The city has an unusual system of gutters (called &quot;Freiburg Bächle&quot;) that run throughout its centre. These &quot;Bächle&quot;, once used to provide water to fight fires and feed livestock, are constantly flowing with water diverted from the Dreisam. They were never intended to be used for sewage, and even in the Middle Ages such use could lead to harsh penalties. During the summer, the running water provides natural cooling of the air, and offers a pleasant gurgling sound. It is said that if one accidentally falls or steps into a &quot;Bächle&quot;, they will marry a Freiburger, or &#x27;Bobbele&#x27;.
The &quot;Augustinerplatz&quot; is one of the central squares in the old city. Formerly the location of an Augustinian monastery that became the Augustiner Museum in 1921, it is now a popular social space for Freiburg&#x27;s younger residents. It has a number of restaurants and bars, including the local brewery &#x27;Feierling&#x27;, which has a Biergarten. On warm summer nights, hundreds of students gather here.

At the centre of the old city is the Münsterplatz or Cathedral Square, Freiburg&#x27;s largest square. A farmers&#x27; market is held here every day except Sundays. This is the site of Freiburg&#x27;s Münster, a gothic minster cathedral constructed of red sandstone, built between 1200 and 1530 and noted for its towering spire.
The Historical Merchants&#x27; Hall (&quot;Historisches Kaufhaus&quot;), is a Late Gothic building on the south side of Freiburg&#x27;s &quot;Münsterplatz&quot;. Built between 1520 and 1530, it was once the center of the financial life of the region. Its façade is decorated with statues and the coat of arms of four Habsburg emperors.

The &quot;Altes Rathaus&quot;, or old city hall, was completed in 1559 and has a painted façade. The &quot;Platz der alten Synagoge&quot; &quot;Old Synagogue Square&quot; is one of the more important squares on the outskirts of the historic old city. The square was the location of a synagogue until it was destroyed on in 1938. Zum Roten Bären, the oldest hotel in Germany, is located along &quot;Oberlinden&quot; near the Swabian Gate.

The &quot;Siegesdenkmal&quot;, or victory monument, is a monument to the German victory in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. It is situated at the northern edge of the historic city center of Freiburg and was built by Karl Friedrich Moest. In everyday language of people living in Freiburg, it serves as an orientation marker or as a meeting place.

To the east of the city centre, the Schlossberg hill provides extensive views over the city and surrounding region. The castle (Schloss) from which the hill takes its name was demolished in the 1740s, and only ruins remain. Schlossberg retained its importance to the city, however, and 150 years ago the city leaders opened up walks and views to make the mountain available to the public. Today, the Schlossbergbahn funicular railway connects the city centre to the hill.

Other museums in the city include the Archaeology Colombischlössle Museum.

== Geography ==

Freiburg is bordered by the Black Forest mountains Rosskopf and Bromberg to the east, Schönberg and Tuniberg to the south, with the Kaiserstuhl hill region to the west.

===Climate===
The Köppen climate classification classifies Freiburg&#x27;s climate as temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;). Thus, July and August are, along with Karlsruhe, the warmest within Germany. Winters are moderate but usually with some frosts at night. More year-round rain occurs here than in the Rhine plateau. The city is close to the Kaiserstuhl, a range of hills of volcanic origin located a few kilometers away, which is one of the warmest places in Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area.

The Freiburg im Breisgau weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Highest Temperature on 13 August 2003.
* Warmest Minimum on 5 July 1957.
* Coldest Maximum on 2 February 1956.
* Lowest Temperature on 10 February 1956.
* Highest Daily Precipitation on 18 May 1994.
* Wettest Month in August 1963.
* Wettest Year in 1965.
* Driest Year in 1953.
* Earliest Snowfall: 20 October 1905.
* Latest Snowfall: 28 April 1985.
* Longest annual sunshine: 2,129.4 hours in 2003.
* Shortest annual sunshine: 1,457.8 hours in 1980.


==Government==
Freiburg is known as an &quot;eco-city&quot;. In June 1995, the Freiburg city council adopted a resolution that it would permit construction only of &quot;low-energy buildings&quot; on municipal land, and all new buildings must comply with certain low energy specifications. The neighbourhoods of Vauban and Rieselfeld were developed and built in the late 1990s in accordance with the principles of sustainability. The city is also home to a branch of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection, as well as solar industry and research. The citizens of Freiburg are known in Germany for their love of cycling and recycling. Freiburg is host to a number of international organisations, in particular, ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, International Solar Energy Society, and the City Mayors Foundation. Politically, it is a longtime stronghold of the Alliance 90/The Greens, who have seen consistent success since the 1990s and have been the largest party on the city council since 2004. For many years, they performed more strongly in Freiburg than any other major city: former mayor Dieter Salomon, who served from 2002 to 2018, was the first member of the Greens to hold such an office in a city of over 100,000 people.

===Mayor===
The current mayor of Freiburg is Martin Horn since 2018. He was previously a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) but left before running for mayor. In the election, he was supported by the SPD and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). The most recent mayoral election was held on 22 April 2018, with a runoff held on 6 May, and the results were as follows:

==Education==

Freiburg is a center of academia and research, in which numerous intellectual figures and Nobel Laureates have lived, worked, and taught.

The city houses one of the oldest and most renowned of German universities, the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg, as well as its medical center. Home to some of the greatest minds of the West, including such eminent figures as Johann Eck, Max Weber, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Friedrich Hayek, it is one of Europe&#x27;s top research and teaching institutions.

Freiburg also plays host to various other educational and research institutes, such as the Freiburg University of Education, the Protestant University for Applied Sciences Freiburg, Freiburg Music Academy, the Catholic University of Applied Sciences Freiburg, the International University of Cooperative Education IUCE, three Max Planck institutes, five Fraunhofer institutes, and one Leibniz institute.

The city is home to the IES Abroad European Union program, which allows students to study the development and activities of the EU. This is in addition to an Environmental Science and Sustainability program focused on Freiburg&#x27;s famed green lifestyle and infrastructure. IES Abroad also offers a German Language and Area Studies program where visiting students get to take classes at the University of Freiburg.

The DFG / LFA Freiburg, a French-German high school established by the 1963 Élysée Treaty, is in the city. UWC Robert Bosch College is among the newest members of the United World Colleges (UWC) movement, one of its eighteen colleges around the world, having started accepting students in September 2014.

==Religion==

Christianity

Freiburg belonged to Austria until 1805 and remained Catholic, although surrounding villages like Haslach, Opfingen, Tiengen, and the surrounding land ruled by the Margrave of Baden became Protestant as a result of the Reformation. The city was part of the Diocese of Konstanz until 1821. That same year, Freiburg became an episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg. Due to a dispute between the government of Baden and the Holy See, the archbishop officially took office in 1827.
The borders of the archdiocese correspond with the borders of the former province of Baden and the former Margraviate of Hohenzollern. The cathedral, in which the bishop resides, is Freiburg Minster. Also, part of the ecclesiastical province of Freiburg are the suffragan dioceses of Mainz and Rottenburg-Stuttgart.

Until 1929, the dioceses of Limburg and Fulda also belonged to this ecclesiastical province. The Archbishop of Freiburg holds the title of metropolitan and the German headquarters of the link to Caritas Germany is in Freiburg.

Saint George (the flag of Freiburg has the cross of George), Lambert of Maastricht and the catacomb saint, Alexander, are the patron saints of Freiburg. Many works of art depicting these saints are in the Freiburg Minster, on the Minster square, just as in the museums and archives of the city, including some by Hans Baldung Grien, Hans Holbein the Younger and Gregorius Sickinger.

In 1805, with the attack of Breisgau on the Grand Duchy of Baden by a Catholic ruler, many Protestants moved into the city. Since 2007, any Protestants who are not part of a &#x27;free church&#x27; belong to the newly founded deanery of Freiburg as part of the parish of Südbaden which in itself is a part of the Landeskirche Baden.

The seat of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Baden, a free Lutheran church, is situated in Freiburg. There are multiple other free Protestant churches: e.g., the Calvary Chapel or Chrischona International. An old congregation has existed in Freiburg since the late 1900s, which utilises the old monastery church of the Ursulines in the black monastery at the border of the old city center. The Catholic Church of St. Maria Schutz has been made available for Masses by Greek, Serbian, Russian and Rumanian Orthodox congregations.

Judaism
Jews are said to have lived in the city before 1230, but it was only after 1230 that they supposedly founded an official community in the Webergasse (a small street within the town center). The counts of Freiburg bought the lucrative Schutzjude, which means that all personal information on Jews living in Freiburg was directly sent to Konrad II and his co-reigning son Friedrich. The two issued a comprising letter promising safety and liberty to all local Jews on 12 October 1338. It lost all value shortly after, however, on 1 January 1349. Although the plague had not yet broken out in the city, Jews were accused of having spread it and taken into custody. All Jews except pregnant women were burned alive on 31 January 1349. The remaining children were forced to be baptised. This pogrom left Jews very hesitant to resettle in the city. In 1401, the city council decreed a regulation banning all Jews from Freiburg (orig. Middle High German dialect: “daz dekein Jude ze Friburg niemmerme sin sol” [27]. This was officially reaffirmed by King Sigismund with a ban for life (orig. German: “Ewige Vertreibung”) in 1424. Not until 1809 were Jews again allowed permanent residence within the city. They subsequently founded a Jewish community in 1836.

At the Kristallnacht in 1938, the synagogue, built in 1870, was set afire. Numerous shops and apartments of Jewish citizens of Freiburg were devastated and plundered by National Socialists without the intervention of police or fire department. Male, wealthy, Jewish citizens were kidnapped and taken to concentration camps (in Buchenwald and Dachau) where they were subjected to forced labor or executed and their money and property stolen.

On 22 October 1940, the remaining Jews of Baden and Pfalz were deported to Camp de Gurs in southern France. One among many collecting points was Annaplatz. So-called &#x27;Stolpersteine&#x27;, tiles with names and dates on them, commemorate the victims of the prosecution of Jews during the Nazi-Era in the city&#x27;s cobble. Journalist Käthe Vordtriede of the Volkswacht even received two Stolpersteine to commemorate her life. The first one was inserted into the ground in front of the Vordtriede-Haus Freiburg in 2006 and the second one in front of the Basler Hof, the regional authorities, in spring 2013. This was also the seat of the Gestapo until 1941, where unrelenting people were cruelly interrogated, held prisoner or deported. The only solutions were flight or emigration. The Vordtriede family managed to escape in time.

==Transport==
Freiburg has a large pedestrian zone in the city centre where no motor cars are allowed. Freiburg also has an extensive public transport system, operated by the city-owned VAG Freiburg. The backbone of the system is the Freiburg tramway network, supplemented by feeder buses. The tram network is very popular as the low fares allow for unlimited transport in the city and surrounding area. Furthermore, any ticket for a concert, sports or other event is also valid for use on public transport. The tram network is so vast that 70% of the population live within 500m of a tram stop with a tram every 7–8 mins.

Freiburg is on the main Frankfurt am Main – Basel railway line, with frequent and fast long-distance passenger services from the Freiburg Hauptbahnhof to major German and other European cities. Other railway lines run east into the Black Forest and west to Breisach and are served by the Breisgau S-Bahn. The line to Breisach is the remaining stub of the Freiburg–Colmar international railway, severed in 1945 when the railway bridge over the Rhine at Breisach was destroyed, and was never replaced.

The city also is served by the A5 Frankfurt am Main – Basel motorway.

Freiburg is served by EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in France, close to the borders of both Germany and Switzerland, south of Freiburg. Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport is approximately north of Freiburg and is also served by several airlines. The nearest larger international airports include Zurich (), Stuttgart (), and Frankfurt/Main (). The nearby Flugplatz Freiburg , a small airfield in the Messe, Freiburg district, lacks commercial service but is used for private aviation.

Car share websites such as BlaBlaCar are commonly used among Freiburg residents, since they are considered relatively safe.

The investment in transport has resulted in a large increase in both cycle, pedestrian and public transport usage with projections of car journeys accounting for 29% of journey times.

The Augustiner Museum presents its renowned collection of art from the Middle Ages to the Baroque as well as 19th century paintings. The former monastery church has been transformed into an impressive, modern museum building that makes a visit to the museum a real experience.

The Museum of Contemporary Art is a forum for important social debates, equally committed to art and the public. Changing exhibitions reflect elementary themes of our time. From the rich collection of 20th and 21st century works, a selection of classical modernism is always on display.

Immediately following the comments, Freiburg mayor Salomon postponed a trip to Isfahan, but most people involved, especially those in the Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens party, were opposed to cancelling the relationship.

==Symbols==

The city&#x27;s coat of arms is Argent a cross Gules, the St George&#x27;s Cross. Saint George is the city&#x27;s patron saint. The cross also appears on the city&#x27;s flag, which dates from about 1368, and is identical to that of England, which has the same patron.

The city also has a seal that can be seen in a few places in the inner city. It is a stylised depiction of the façade of the &quot;Wasserschlössle&quot;, a castle-like waterworks facility built into a hill that overlooks the residential district of Wiehre. The seal depicts a three-towered red castle on a white background, with green-clad trumpeters atop the two outer towers. Beneath the castle is a gold fleur-de-lis.

<text>The Alfred National Park is a national park located in the East Gippsland region of the Australian state of Victoria. The national park is situated approximately east of Melbourne and was declared in 1925.

It is currently closed due to widespread bushfire damage.

The park is dissected by the Princes Highway, between and .

==Features==

The park reserves examples of warm temperate rainforest, particularly the jungle of Mount Drummer. Compared to the tropical rainforests of Queensland and New South Wales, this is a floristically depauperate forest, representing as it does the southern limit of this flora. This region is biogeographically interesting as the meeting point between the subtropical flora of the north of Australia and the cool temperate and arid zone floras of the south and west. The rainforest community consists of a closed canopy of Lilly Pilly &quot;Acmena smithii&quot; with numerous lianas, ferns, and epiphytes. The park is particularly known for the occurrence of four varieties of tree ferns and epiphytic orchids such as the orange-blossom orchid &quot;Sarcochilus falcatus&quot; and the rock orchid &quot;Dendrobium speciosum&quot;. In the 1983 &#x27;Ash Wednesday&#x27; bushfires, the park was burned very badly.

<text>National nature reserves in England are designated by Natural England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed on behalf of the nation, many by Natural England itself, but also by non-governmental organisations, including the members of The Wildlife Trusts partnership, the National Trust, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

There are 221 NNRs in England covering . Often they contain rare or nationally important populations of species, such as birds, plants, insects, reptiles and mammals.

<doc id="101843" wikidata="Q262464" url="?curid=101843" title="Degenerate distribution">
<text>In mathematics, a degenerate distribution (sometimes also Dirac distribution) is, according to some, a probability distribution in a space with support only on a manifold of lower dimension, and according to others a distribution with support only at a single point. By the latter definition, it is a deterministic distribution and takes only a single value. Examples include a two-headed coin and rolling a die whose sides all show the same number. This distribution satisfies the definition of &quot;random variable&quot; even though it does not appear random in the everyday sense of the word; hence it is considered degenerate.

In the case of a real-valued random variable, the degenerate distribution is a one-point distribution, localized at a point &quot;k&quot;0 on the real line. The probability mass function equals 1 at this point and 0 elsewhere.

The degenerate univariate distribution can be viewed as the limiting case of a continuous distribution whose variance goes to 0 causing the probability density function to be a delta function at &quot;k&quot;0, with infinite height there but area equal to 1.

The cumulative distribution function of the univariate degenerate distribution is:

formula_1

==Constant random variable==
In probability theory, a constant random variable is a discrete random variable that takes a constant value, regardless of any event that occurs. This is technically different from an almost surely constant random variable, which may take other values, but only on events with probability zero. Constant and almost surely constant random variables, which have a degenerate distribution, provide a way to deal with constant values in a probabilistic framework.

Let  &quot;X&quot;: Ω → R  be a random variable defined on a probability space  (Ω, &quot;P&quot;). Then  &quot;X&quot;  is an &quot;almost surely constant random variable&quot; if there exists formula_2 such that
:formula_3
and is furthermore a &quot;constant random variable&quot; if
:formula_4

A constant random variable is almost surely constant, but not necessarily &quot;vice versa&quot;, since if  &quot;X&quot;  is almost surely constant then there may exist  γ ∈ Ω  such that  &quot;X&quot;(γ) ≠ &quot;k&quot;0  (but then necessarily Pr({γ}) = 0, in fact Pr(X ≠ &quot;k&quot;0) = 0).

For practical purposes, the distinction between  &quot;X&quot;  being constant or almost surely constant is unimportant, since the cumulative distribution function  &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)  of  &quot;X&quot;  does not depend on whether  &quot;X&quot;  is constant or &#x27;merely&#x27; almost surely constant. In either case,
:formula_5
The function  &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)  is a step function; in particular it is a translation of the Heaviside step function.

==Higher dimensions==

Degeneracy of a multivariate distribution in &quot;n&quot; random variables arises when the support lies in a space of dimension less than &quot;n&quot;. This occurs when at least one of the variables is a deterministic function of the others. For example, in the 2-variable case suppose that &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;aX + b&quot; for scalar random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and scalar constants &quot;a&quot; ≠ 0 and &quot;b&quot;; here knowing the value of one of &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; gives exact knowledge of the value of the other. All the possible points (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) fall on the one-dimensional line &quot;y = ax + b&quot;. 

In general when one or more of &quot;n&quot; random variables are exactly linearly determined by the others, if the covariance matrix exists its rank is less than &quot;n&quot; and its determinant is 0, so it is positive semi-definite but not positive definite, and the joint probability distribution is degenerate.

Degeneracy can also occur even with non-zero covariance. For example, when scalar &quot;X&quot; is symmetrically distributed about 0 and &quot;Y&quot; is exactly given by &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;X&quot;2, all possible points (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) fall on the parabola &quot;y = x&quot;2, which is a one-dimensional subset of the two-dimensional space.

<text>The Canadian dollar (symbol: $; code: CAD; ) is the currency of Canada. It is abbreviated with the dollar sign $. There is no standard disambiguating form, but the abbreviations Can$, CA$ and C$ are frequently used for distinction from other dollar-denominated currencies (though C$ remains ambiguous with the Nicaraguan córdoba). It is divided into 100 cents (¢).

Owing to the image of a common loon on its reverse, the dollar coin, and sometimes the unit of currency itself, may be referred to as the &quot;loonie&quot; by English-speaking Canadians and foreign exchange traders and analysts.

Accounting for approximately two per cent of all global reserves, the Canadian dollar is the fifth-most held reserve currency in the world, behind the US dollar, euro, yen, and sterling. The Canadian dollar is popular with central banks because of Canada&#x27;s relative economic soundness, the Canadian government&#x27;s strong sovereign position, and the stability of the country&#x27;s legal and political systems.

== History ==
===Colonial currencies===
The 1850s in Canada were a decade of debate over whether to adopt a £sd-based monetary system or a decimal monetary system based on the US dollar. The British North American provinces, for reasons of practicality in relation to the increasing trade with the neighbouring United States, had a desire to assimilate their currencies with the American unit, but the imperial authorities in London still preferred sterling as the sole currency throughout the British Empire. The British North American provinces nonetheless gradually adopted currencies tied to the American dollar.

====Province of Canada====

In 1841, the Province of Canada adopted a new system based on the Halifax rating. The new Canadian pound was equal to four US dollars (92.88 grains gold), making £1 sterling equal to £1.4&quot;s&quot;.4&quot;d&quot;. Canadian. Thus, the new Canadian pound was worth 16 shillings and 5.3 pence sterling.

In 1851, the Parliament of the Province of Canada passed an act for the purposes of introducing a sterling-based unit, with decimal fractional coinage. The idea was that the decimal coins would correspond to exact amounts in relation to the U.S. dollar fractional coinage.

In response to British concerns, in 1853, an act of the Parliament of the Province of Canada introduced the gold standard into the colony, based on both the British gold sovereign and the American gold eagle coins. This gold standard was introduced with the gold sovereign being legal tender at £1 = US$. No coinage was provided for under the 1853 act. Sterling coinage was made legal tender and all other silver coins were demonetized. The British government in principle allowed for a decimal coinage but nevertheless held out the hope that a sterling unit would be chosen under the name of &quot;royal&quot;. However, in 1857, the decision was made to introduce a decimal coinage into the Province of Canada in conjunction with the U.S. dollar unit. Hence, when the new decimal coins were introduced in 1858, the colony&#x27;s currency became aligned with the U.S. currency, although the British gold sovereign continued to remain legal tender at the rate of £1 = Can$ right up until the 1990s. In 1859, Canadian colonial postage stamps were issued with decimal denominations for the first time. In 1861, Canadian postage stamps were issued with the denominations shown in dollars and cents.

====Maritime colonies====
In 1860, the colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia followed the Province of Canada in adopting a decimal system based on the U.S. dollar unit.

In 1871, Prince Edward Island went decimal within the U.S. dollar unit and introduced coins in the denomination of 1 cent. However, the currency of Prince Edward Island was absorbed into the Canadian system shortly afterwards, when Prince Edward Island joined the Dominion of Canada in 1873.

====Newfoundland====
Newfoundland went decimal in 1865, but unlike the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it decided to adopt a unit based on the Spanish dollar rather than on the U.S. dollar, and there was a slight difference between these two units. The U.S. dollar was created in 1792 on the basis of the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. As such, the Spanish dollar was worth slightly more than the U.S. dollar, and likewise, the Newfoundland dollar, until 1895, was worth slightly more than the Canadian dollar.

====British Columbia====
The Colony of British Columbia adopted the British Columbia dollar as its currency in 1865, at par with the Canadian dollar. When British Columbia joined Canada as its sixth province in 1871, the Canadian dollar replaced the British Columbia dollar.

===Post-Confederation history===
In 1867, the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia united into a federation named Canada. As a result, their respective currencies were merged into a singular Canadian dollar. The Canadian Parliament passed the &quot;Uniform Currency Act&quot; in April 1871, tying up loose ends as to the currencies of the various provinces and replacing them with a common Canadian dollar.

The gold standard was temporarily abandoned during World War I and definitively abolished on April 10, 1933. At the outbreak of World War II, the exchange rate to the U.S. dollar was fixed at Can$1.10 = US$1.00. This was changed to parity in 1946. In 1949, sterling was devalued and Canada followed, returning to a peg of Can$1.10 = US$1.00. However, Canada allowed its dollar to float in 1950, whereupon the currency rose to a slight premium over the U.S. dollar for the next decade. But the Canadian dollar fell sharply after 1960 before it was again pegged in 1962 at Can$1.00 = US$0.925. This was sometimes pejoratively referred to as the &quot;Diefenbuck&quot; or the &quot;Diefendollar&quot;, after the then Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker. This peg lasted until 1970, with the currency&#x27;s value being floated since then.

==Terminology==

Canadian English, similar to American English, used the slang term &quot;buck&quot; for a former paper dollar. The Canadian origin of this term derives from a coin struck by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company during the 17th century with a value equal to the pelt of a male beaver – a &quot;buck&quot;. Because of the appearance of the common loon on the back of the $1 coin that replaced the dollar bill in 1987, the word &quot;loonie&quot; was adopted in Canadian parlance to distinguish the Canadian dollar coin from the dollar bill. When the two-dollar coin was introduced in 1996, the derivative word &quot;toonie&quot; (&quot;two loonies&quot;) became the common word for it in Canadian English slang.

In French, the currency is also called ; Canadian French slang terms include or (the original word used in 18th-century French to translate &quot;dollar&quot;) and (equivalent to &quot;loonie&quot;, since is French for &quot;loon,&quot; the bird appearing on the coin). The French pronunciation of (pronounced similarly to English as or , not like the word for hundred, or ) is generally used for the subdivision; is another, informal, term for 1¢. 25¢ coins in Quebec French are often called (&quot;thirty cents&quot;) because of a series of changes in terminology, currencies, and exchange rates. After the British conquest of Canada in 1760, French coins gradually went out of use, and became a nickname for the halfpenny, which was similar in value to the French &quot;sou&quot;. Spanish dollars and U.S. dollars were also in use, and from 1841 to 1858, the exchange rate was fixed at $4 = £1  (or 400¢ = 240&quot;d&quot;). This made 25¢ equal to 15&quot;d&quot;, or 30 halfpence (). After decimalization and the withdrawal of halfpenny coins, the nickname began to be used for the 1¢ coin, but the idiom for 25¢ endured.

==Coins==
Coins are produced by the Royal Canadian Mint&#x27;s facilities in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Ottawa, Ontario, in denominations of 5¢ (nickel), 10¢ (dime), 25¢ (quarter), 50¢ (50¢ piece) (though the 50¢ piece is no longer distributed to banks and is only available directly from the mint, therefore seeing very little circulation), $1 (loonie), and $2 (toonie). The last 1¢ coin (penny) to be minted in Canada was struck on May 4, 2012, and distribution of the penny ceased on February 4, 2013. Ever since, the price for a cash transaction is rounded to the nearest five cents. The penny continues to be legal tender, although it is only accepted as payment and is not given back as change.

The standard set of designs has Canadian symbols, usually wildlife, on the reverse, and an effigy of Charles III on the obverse. A large number of pennies, nickels, and dimes are in circulation bearing the effigy of Elizabeth II, and occasionally some depicting George VI can be found. It is also common for American coins to be found among circulation due to the close proximity to the United States and the fact that the sizes and colours of the coins are similar. Commemorative coins with differing reverses are also issued on an irregular basis, most often quarters. 50¢ coins are rarely found in circulation; they are often collected and not regularly used in day-to-day transactions in most provinces.

===Coin history===
In 1858, bronze 1¢ and 0.925 silver 5¢, 10¢ and 20¢ coins were issued by the Province of Canada. Except for 1¢ coins struck in 1859, no more coins were issued until 1870, when production of the 5¢ and 10¢ was resumed and silver 25¢ and 50¢ were introduced. Between 1908 and 1919, sovereigns (legal tender in Canada for $) were struck in Ottawa with a &quot;C&quot; mintmark.

Canada produced its first gold dollar coins in 1912 in the form of $5 and $10. These coins were produced from 1912 to 1914. The obverse carries an image of King George V and on the reverse is a shield with the arms of the Dominion of Canada. Gold from the Klondike River valley in the Yukon accounts for much of the gold in the coins.

Two years into the coin&#x27;s production World War I began and production of the coins stopped in favour of tighter control over Canadian gold reserves. Most of the 1914 coins produced never reached circulation at the time and some were stored for more than 75 years until being sold off in 2012. The high quality specimens were sold to the public and the visually unappealing ones were melted.

In 1920, the size of the 1¢ was reduced and the silver fineness of the 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ coins was reduced to 0.800 silver/.200 copper. This composition was maintained for the 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ piece through 1966, but the debasement of the 5¢ piece continued in 1922 with the silver 5¢ being entirely replaced by a larger nickel coin. In 1942, as a wartime measure, nickel was replaced by tombac in the 5¢ coin, which was changed in shape from round to dodecagonal. Chromium-plated steel was used for the 5¢ in 1944 and 1945 and between 1951 and 1954, after which nickel was readopted. The 5¢ returned to a round shape in 1963.

In 1935, the 0.800 silver voyageur dollar was introduced. Production was maintained through 1967 with the exception of the war years between 1939 and 1945.

In 1967 both 0.800 silver/0.200 copper and, later that year, 0.500 silver/.500 copper 10¢ and 25¢ coins were issued. 1968 saw further debasement: the 0.500 fine silver dimes and quarters were completely replaced by nickel ones mid-year. All 1968 50¢ and $1 coins were reduced in size and coined only in pure nickel. Thus, 1968 marked the last year in which any circulating silver coinage was issued in Canada.
In 1982, the 1¢ coin was changed to dodecagonal, and the 5¢ was further debased to a cupro-nickel alloy. In 1987 a $1 coin struck in aureate-plated nickel was introduced. A bimetallic $2 coin followed in 1996. In 1997, copper-plated zinc replaced bronze in the 1¢, and it returned to a round shape. This was followed, in 2000, by the introduction of even cheaper plated-steel 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ coins, with the 1¢ plated in copper and the others plated in cupro-nickel. In 2012, the multi-ply plated-steel technology was introduced for $1 and $2 coins as well. Also in that year mintage of the 1¢ coin ceased and its withdrawal from circulation began in 2013.

==Banknotes==
The first paper money issued in Canada denominated in dollars were British Army bills, issued between 1813 and 1815. Canadian dollar banknotes were later issued by the chartered banks starting in the 1830s, by several pre-Confederation colonial governments (most notably the Province of Canada in 1866), and after confederation, by the Canadian government starting in 1870. Some municipalities also issued notes, most notably &quot;depression scrip&quot; during the 1930s.

On July 3, 1934, with only 10 chartered banks still issuing notes, the Bank of Canada was founded. This new government agency became the sole issuer of all federal notes. In 1935, it issued its first series of notes in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $25, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. The $25 note was a commemorative issue, released to mark the Silver Jubilee of King George V. In 1944, the chartered banks were prohibited from issuing their own currency, with the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal among the last to issue notes.

Significant design changes to the notes have occurred since 1935, with new series introduced in 1937, 1954, 1970, 1986, and 2001. In June 2011, newly designed notes printed on a polymer substrate, as opposed to cotton fibre, were announced; the first of these polymer notes, the $100 bill, began circulation on November 14, 2011, the $50 bill began circulation on March 26, 2012, the $20 denomination began circulation on November 7, 2012, and the $5 and $10 denominations began circulation on November 12, 2013.

Since 1935, all banknotes are printed by the Ottawa-based Canadian Bank Note Company under contract to the Bank of Canada. Previously, a second company, BA International (founded in 1866 as the British American Bank Note Company), shared printing duties. In 2011, BA International announced it would close its banknote printing business and cease printing banknotes at the end of 2012; since then, the Canadian Bank Note Company has been the sole printer of Canadian banknotes.

All banknotes from series prior to the established polymer series are considered unfit for circulation due to their lacking of any modern security features, such as a metallic stripe. Financial institutions must return the banknotes to the Bank of Canada, which will then destroy them. Individuals may keep the banknotes indefinitely.

==Legal tender==
As of January 1, 2021, the $1, $2, $25, $500 and $1000 notes issued by the Bank of Canada are no longer legal tender. All other Canadian dollar banknotes issued by the Bank of Canada remain as legal tender in Canada. However, commercial transactions may legally be settled in any manner agreed by the parties involved.

Legal tender of Canadian coinage is governed by the &quot;Currency Act&quot;, which sets out limits of:
* $40 if the denomination is $2 or greater but does not exceed $10;
* $25 if the denomination is $1;
* $10 if the denomination is 10¢ or greater but less than $1;
* $5 if the denomination is 5¢;
* 25¢ if the denomination is 1¢.

Retailers in Canada may refuse bank notes without breaking the law. According to legal guidelines, the method of payment has to be mutually agreed upon by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, stores may refuse $100 banknotes if they feel that would put them at risk of being counterfeit victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.

Canadian dollars, especially coins, are accepted by some businesses in the northernmost cities of the United States and in many Canadian snowbird enclaves, just as U.S. dollars are accepted by some Canadian businesses.

In 2012, Iceland considered adopting the Canadian dollar as a stable alternative to the Icelandic króna.
Canada was favoured due to its northern geography and similar resource-based economy, in addition to its relative economic stability. The Canadian ambassador to Iceland said that Iceland could adopt the currency; although Iceland ultimately decided not to move on with the proposal.

==Value==

Since 76.7% of Canada&#x27;s exports go to the U.S., and 53.3% of imports into Canada come from the U.S., Canadians are interested in the value of their currency mainly against the U.S. dollar. Although domestic concerns arise when the dollar trades much lower than its U.S. counterpart, there is also concern among exporters when the dollar appreciates quickly. A rise in the value of the dollar increases the price of Canadian exports to the U.S. On the other hand, there are advantages to a rising dollar, in that it is cheaper for Canadian industries to purchase foreign material and businesses.

The Bank of Canada has no target value for the Canadian dollar and has not intervened in foreign exchange markets since 1998. The Bank&#x27;s official position is that market conditions should determine the worth of the Canadian dollar, although it occasionally makes minor attempts to influence its value.

On world markets, the Canadian dollar historically tended to move in tandem with the U.S. dollar. An apparently rising Canadian dollar (against the U.S. dollar) was decreasing against other international currencies; however, during the rise of the Canadian dollar between 2002 and 2013, it gained value against the U.S. dollar as well as other international currencies. In recent years, dramatic fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar have tended to correlate with shifts in oil prices, reflecting the Canadian dollar&#x27;s status as a petrocurrency owing to Canada&#x27;s significant oil exports.

The Canadian dollar traded at a record high of in terms of American greenbacks on July 11, 1864, since the latter was inconvertible paper currency. However, the Canadian dollar remained close to par or 1:1 versus the gold or silver US dollar of the time.

Unlike other currencies in the Bretton Woods system, whose values were fixed, the Canadian dollar was allowed to float from 1950 to 1962. Between 1952 and 1960, the Canadian dollar traded at a slight premium over the U.S. dollar, reaching a high of on August 20, 1957.

The Canadian dollar fell considerably after 1960, and this contributed to Prime Minister John Diefenbaker&#x27;s defeat in the 1963 election. The Canadian dollar returned to a fixed exchange rate regime in 1962 when its value was set at , where it remained until 1970.

As an inflation-fighting measure, the Canadian dollar was allowed to float in 1970. Its value appreciated and it was worth more than the U.S. dollar for part of the 1970s. The high point was on April 25, 1974, when it reached .

The Canadian dollar fell in value against its American counterpart during the technological boom of the 1990s that was centred in the United States, and was traded for as little as US$0.6179 on January 21, 2002, which was an all-time low. Since then, its value against all major currencies rose until 2013, due in part to high prices for commodities (especially oil) that Canada exports.

The Canadian dollar&#x27;s value against the U.S. dollar rose sharply in 2007 because of the continued strength of the Canadian economy and the U.S. currency&#x27;s weakness on world markets. During trading on September 20, 2007, it met the U.S. dollar at parity for the first time since November 25, 1976.

Inflation in the value of the Canadian dollar has been fairly low since the 1990s. In 2007 the Canadian dollar rebounded, soaring 23% in value.

On September 28, 2007, the Canadian dollar closed above the U.S. dollar for the first time in 30 years, at US$1.0052. On November 7, 2007, it hit US$1.1024 during trading, a modern-day high after China announced it would diversify its trillion foreign exchange reserve away from the U.S. dollar. By November 30, however, the Canadian dollar was once again at par with the U.S. dollar, and on December 4, the dollar had retreated back to US$0.98, through a cut in interest rates made by the Bank of Canada due to concerns about exports to the U.S.

Due to its soaring value and new record highs at the time, the Canadian dollar was named the Canadian Newsmaker of the Year for 2007 by the Canadian edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Since the late 2000s, the Canadian dollar has been valued at levels comparable to the years before its swift rise in 2007. For most of the 2010s, the exchange rate of Canadian to US dollars was approximately US$0.70 to Can$1.00.

==Reserve currency==
A number of central banks (and commercial banks) keep Canadian dollars as a reserve currency. The Canadian dollar is considered to be a benchmark currency.

In the economy of the Americas, the Canadian dollar plays a similar role to that of the Australian dollar (AUD) in the Asia-Pacific region. The Canadian dollar (as a regional reserve currency for banking) has been an important part of the British, French and Dutch Caribbean states&#x27; economies and finance systems since the 1950s. The Canadian dollar is held by many central banks in Central and South America as well.

By observing how the Canadian dollar behaves against the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and patterns in the U.S. economy that could not be seen by direct observation. The Canadian dollar has fully evolved into a global reserve currency only since the 1970s, when it was floated against all other world currencies. Some economists have attributed the rise of importance of the Canadian dollar to the long-term effects of the Nixon Shock that effectively ended the Bretton Woods system of global finance.

<text>ALOHAnet, also known as the ALOHA System, or simply ALOHA, was a pioneering computer networking system developed at the University of Hawaii. ALOHAnet became operational in June 1971, providing the first public demonstration of a wireless packet data network. 

The ALOHAnet used a new method of medium access, called &quot;ALOHA random access&quot;, and experimental ultra high frequency (UHF) for its operation. In its simplest form, later known as Pure ALOHA, remote units communicated with a base station (Menehune) over two separate radio frequencies (for inbound and outbound respectively). Nodes did not wait for the channel to be clear before sending, but instead waited for acknowledgement of successful receipt of a message, and re-sent it if this was not received. Nodes would also stop and re-transmit data if they detected any other messages while transmitting. While simple to implement, this results in an efficiency of only 18.4%. A later advancement, Slotted ALOHA, improved the efficiency of the protocol by reducing the chance of collision, improving throughput to 36.8%.

ALOHA was subsequently employed in the Ethernet cable based network in the 1970s, and following regulatory developments in the early 1980s it became possible to use the ALOHA random-access techniques in both Wi-Fi and in mobile telephone networks. ALOHA channels were used in a limited way in the 1980s in 1G mobile phones for signaling and control purposes. In the late 1980s, the European standardization group GSM who worked on the Pan-European Digital mobile communication system GSM greatly expanded the use of ALOHA channels for access to radio channels in mobile telephony. In the early 2000s additional ALOHA channels were added to 2.5G and 3G mobile phones with the widespread introduction of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), using a slotted-ALOHA random-access channel combined with a version of the Reservation ALOHA scheme first analyzed by a group at BBN Technologies.

== History ==

One of the early computer networking designs, development of the ALOHA network was begun in September 1968 at the University of Hawaii under the leadership of Norman Abramson and Franklin Kuo, along with Thomas Gaarder, Shu Lin, Wesley Peterson and Edward (&quot;Ned&quot;) Weldon. The goal was to use low-cost commercial radio equipment to connect users on Oahu and the other Hawaiian islands with a central time-sharing computer on the main Oahu campus. The first packet broadcasting unit went into operation in June 1971. Terminals were connected to a special purpose &quot;terminal connection unit&quot; using RS-232 at .

ALOHA was originally a contrived acronym standing for Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area.

The original version of ALOHA used two distinct frequencies in a hub configuration, with the hub machine broadcasting packets to everyone on the &quot;outbound&quot; channel, and the various client machines sending data packets to the hub on the &quot;inbound&quot; channel. If data was received correctly at the hub, a short acknowledgment packet was sent to the client; if an acknowledgment was not received by a client machine after a short wait time, it would automatically retransmit the data packet after waiting a randomly selected time interval. This acknowledgment mechanism was used to detect and correct for collisions created when two client machines both attempted to send a packet at the same time.

ALOHAnet&#x27;s primary importance was its use of a shared medium for client transmissions. Unlike the ARPANET where each node could only talk to a single node at the other end of a wire or satellite circuit, in ALOHAnet all client nodes communicated with the hub on the same frequency. This meant that some sort of mechanism was needed to control who could talk at what time. The ALOHAnet solution was to allow each client to send its data without controlling when it was sent, and implementing an acknowledgment/retransmission scheme to deal with collisions. This approach radically reduced the complexity of the protocol and the networking hardware, since nodes do not need to negotiate &quot;who&quot; is allowed to speak.

This solution became known as a pure ALOHA, or random-access channel, and was the basis for subsequent Ethernet development and later Wi-Fi networks. Various versions of the ALOHA protocol (such as Slotted ALOHA) also appeared later in satellite communications, and were used in wireless data networks such as ARDIS, Mobitex, CDPD, and GSM.

The Aloha network introduced the mechanism of randomized multiple access, which resolved device transmission collisions by transmitting a packet immediately if no acknowledgement is present, and if no acknowledgment was received, the transmission was repeated after a random waiting time. The probability distribution of this random waiting time for retransmission of a packet that has not been acknowledged as received is critically important for the stability of Aloha-type communication systems. The average waiting time for retransmission is typically shorter than the average time for generation of a new packet from the same client node, but it should not be allowed to be so short as to compromise the stability of the network, causing a collapse in its overall throughput.

Also important was ALOHAnet&#x27;s use of the outgoing hub channel to broadcast packets directly to all clients on a second shared frequency and using an address in each packet to allow selective receipt at each client node. Separate frequencies were used for incoming and outgoing communications to the hub so that devices could receive acknowledgments regardless of transmissions.

== Protocol ==

=== Pure ALOHA ===
The original version of the protocol (now called Pure ALOHA, and the one implemented in ALOHAnet) was quite simple:

* If you have data to send, send the data
* If, while you are transmitting data, you receive any data from another station, there has been a message collision. All transmitting stations will need to try resending &quot;later&quot;.

Pure ALOHA does not check whether the channel is busy before transmitting. Since collisions can occur and data may have to be sent again, ALOHA cannot efficiently use 100% of the capacity of the communications channel. How long a station waits until it retransmits, and the likelihood a collision occurs are interrelated, and both affect how efficiently the channel can be used. This means that the concept of &quot;retransmit later&quot; is a critical aspect; The quality of the backoff scheme chosen significantly influences the efficiency of the protocol, the ultimate channel capacity, and the predictability of its behavior.

To assess Pure ALOHA, there is a need to predict its throughput, the rate of (successful) transmission of frames. First make a few simplifying assumptions:

* All frames have the same length.
* Stations cannot generate a frame while transmitting or trying to transmit. That is, while a station is sending or trying to resend a frame, it cannot be allowed to generate more frames to send.
* The population of stations attempting to transmit (both new transmission and retransmissions) follows a Poisson distribution.

Let refer to the time needed to transmit one frame on the channel, and define &quot;frame-time&quot; as a unit of time equal to . Let refer to the mean used in the Poisson distribution over transmission-attempt amounts. That is, on average, there are transmission attempts per &quot;frame-time&quot;.

Consider what needs to happen for a frame to be transmitted successfully. Let refer to the time at which it is intended to send a frame. It is preferable to use the channel for one frame-time beginning at , and all other stations to refrain from transmitting during this time.

For any frame-time, the probability of there being transmission-attempts during that frame-time is:

formula_1

The average number of transmission-attempts for two consecutive frame-times is . Hence, for any pair of consecutive frame-times, the probability of there being transmission attempts during those two frame-times is:

:formula_2

Therefore, the probability (formula_3) of there being zero transmission-attempts between and (and thus of a successful transmission for us) is:

:formula_4

The throughput can be calculated as the rate of transmission attempts multiplied by the probability of success, and it can be concluded that the throughput (formula_5) is:

:formula_6

The maximum throughput is frames per frame-time (reached when formula_7), which is approximately 0.184 frames per frame-time. This means that, in Pure ALOHA, only about 18.4% of the time is used for successful transmissions.

=== Slotted ALOHA ===
An improvement to the original ALOHA protocol was Slotted ALOHA, which introduced discrete time slots and increased the maximum throughput. A station can start a transmission only at the beginning of a time slot, and thus collisions are reduced. In this case, only transmission-attempts within 1 frame-time and not 2 consecutive frame-times need to be considered, since collisions can only occur during each time slot. Thus, the probability of there being zero transmission attempts by other stations in a single time slot is:

formula_8

the probability of a transmission requiring exactly k attempts is (k-1 collisions and 1 success):

formula_9

The throughput is:

formula_10

The maximum throughput is &quot;1/e&quot; frames per frame-time (reached when &quot;G&quot; = 1), which is approximately 0.368 frames per frame-time, or 36.8%.

Slotted ALOHA is used in low-data-rate tactical satellite communications networks by military forces, in subscriber-based satellite communications networks, mobile telephony call setup, set-top box communications and in the contactless RFID technologies.

=== Reservation ALOHA ===

Reservation ALOHA, or R-ALOHA, is an effort to improve the efficiency of Slotted ALOHA. The improvements with Reservation ALOHA are markedly shorter delays and ability to efficiently support higher levels of utilization. As a contrast of efficiency, simulations have shown that Reservation ALOHA exhibits less delay at 80% utilization than Slotted ALOHA at 20–36% utilization.

The chief difference between Slotted and Reservation ALOHA is that with Slotted ALOHA, any slot is available for utilization without regards to prior usage. Under Reservation ALOHA&#x27;s contention-based reservation schema, the slot is temporarily considered &quot;owned&quot; by the station that successfully used it. Additionally, Reservation ALOHA simply stops sending data once the station has completed its transmission. As a rule, idle slots are considered available to all stations that may then implicitly reserve (utilize) the slot on a contention basis.

=== Packet Reservation Multiple Access ===

Packet reservation multiple access (PRMA) is an implicit reservation scheme.
Some fixed number of slots form a frame.
After each frame, the satellite broadcasts the status of each slot from the previous frame, which indicates the reservation status of the corresponding slots of the next frame.
All ground stations wishing to transmit compete exactly like slotted ALOHA during any &quot;free slot&quot; of that next frame (i.e., either no one transmitted in that slot of the previous frame, or there was a collision when multiple ground stations transmitted in that slot of the previous frame).
If exactly one ground station happens to transmit during a &quot;free slot&quot;, that ground station succeeds in reserving that slot of a frame -- the corresponding slot is implicitly reserved in all future frames.
From then on, the satellite broadcasts that that particular ground station has reserved that slot of the frame, and that ground station can continue transmitting with a guaranteed data rate during that slot of the frame; other ground stations are careful *not* to transmit during that slot of the frame, so there are no collisions during reserved slots.
When a ground station with a reserved slot has nothing to send, it simply stops transmitting, which gives up its reservation; the satellite notices its reserved slot is idle in one frame, and broadcasts that fact, which indicates that that slot will be a &quot;free slot&quot; in the next frame.

Maximum channel efficiency for slotted ALOHA is 36%; PRMA improves maximum channel efficiency to 80%.

=== Demand Assigned Multiple Access ===
Demand assigned multiple access (DAMA), also called reservation ALOHA, is an explicit reservation scheme often used in satellite communications.
DAMA alternates between two phases: During the reservation phase of a frame, DAMA acts like slotted ALOHA for some fixed number of short slots, except instead of ground stations sending complete packets, ground stations only send short requests for later transmission. The satellite collects all the successful requests (i.e., the ones not destroyed by collision) and sends them back as a reservation list assigning specific ground stations to specific TDM slots. During the TDM phase of a frame, the ground stations obey the reservation list and each one only transmits during the long TDM slot(s) reserved for it.
Collisions may occur during the reservation phase, but not during the TDM phase.

Maximum channel efficiency for slotted ALOHA is 36%; DAMA improves maximum channel efficiency to 80%.

=== Mobile Slotted Aloha ===
=== Other protocols ===

The use of a random-access channel in ALOHAnet led to the development of carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA), a &quot;listen before send&quot; random-access protocol that can be used when all nodes send and receive on the same channel. CSMA in radio channels was extensively modeled. The AX.25 packet radio protocol is based on the CSMA approach with collision recovery, based on the experience gained from ALOHAnet. A variation of CSMA, CSMA/CD is used in early versions of Ethernet.

ALOHA and the other random-access protocols have an inherent variability in their throughput and delay performance characteristics. For this reason, applications that need highly deterministic load behavior may use master/slave or token-passing schemes (such as Token Ring or ARCNET) instead of contention systems.

== Hardware ==

The central node communications processor was an HP 2100 minicomputer called the Menehune, which is the Hawaiian language word for dwarf people, and was named for its similar role to the original ARPANET Interface Message Processor (IMP) which was being deployed at about the same time. In the original system, the Menehune forwarded correctly received user data to the UH central computer, an IBM System 360/65 time-sharing system. Outgoing messages from the 360 were converted into packets by the Menehune, which were queued and broadcast to the remote users at a data rate of . Unlike the half-duplex radios at the user TCUs, the Menehune was interfaced to the radio channels with full-duplex radio equipment.

The original user interface developed for the system was an all-hardware unit called an ALOHAnet Terminal Control Unit (TCU) and was the sole piece of equipment necessary to connect a terminal into the ALOHA channel. The TCU was composed of a UHF antenna, transceiver, modem, buffer and control unit. The buffer was designed for a full line length of 80 characters, which allowed handling of both the 40- and 80-character fixed-length packets defined for the system. The typical user terminal in the original system consisted of a Teletype Model 33 or a dumb CRT user terminal connected to the TCU using a standard RS-232 interface. Shortly after the original ALOHA network went into operation, the TCU was redesigned with one of the first Intel microprocessors, and the resulting upgrade was called a Programmable Control Unit (PCU).

Additional basic functions performed by the TCUs and PCUs were generation of a cyclic-parity-check code vector and decoding of received packets for packet error detection purposes, and generation of packet retransmissions using a simple random interval generator. If an acknowledgment was not received from the Menehune after the prescribed number of automatic retransmissions, a flashing light was used as an indicator to the human user. Also, since the TCUs and PCUs did not send acknowledgments to the Menehune, a steady warning light was displayed to the human user when an error was detected in a received packet. Considerable simplification was incorporated into the initial design of the TCU as well as the PCU for interfacing a human user into the network.

In later versions of the system, simple radio relays were placed in operation to connect the main network on the island of Oahu to other islands in Hawaii, and Menehune routing capabilities were expanded to allow user nodes to exchange packets with other user nodes, the ARPANET, and an experimental satellite network.

== Network architecture ==

Two fundamental choices which dictated much of the ALOHAnet design were the two-channel star configuration of the network and the use of random access for user transmissions.

The two-channel configuration was primarily chosen to allow for efficient transmission of the relatively dense total traffic stream being returned to users by the central time-sharing computer. An additional reason for the star configuration was the desire to centralize as many communication functions as possible at the central network node (the Menehune) to minimize the cost of the original all-hardware terminal control unit (TCU) at each user node.

The random-access channel for communication between users and the Menehune was designed specifically for the traffic characteristics of interactive computing. In a conventional communication system, a user might be assigned a portion of the channel on either a frequency-division multiple access or time-division multiple access basis. Since it was well known that in time-sharing systems (circa 1970), computer and user data are bursty, such fixed assignments are generally wasteful of bandwidth because of the high peak-to-average data rates that characterize the traffic.

To achieve a more efficient use of bandwidth for bursty traffic, ALOHAnet developed the random-access packet switching method that has come to be known as a &quot;pure ALOHA&quot; channel. This approach effectively dynamically allocates bandwidth immediately to a user who has data to send, using the acknowledgment and retransmission mechanism described earlier to deal with occasional access collisions. While the average channel loading must be kept below about 10% to maintain a low collision rate, this still results in better bandwidth efficiency than when fixed allocations are used in a bursty traffic context.

Two 100 kHz channels in the experimental UHF band were used in the implemented system, one for the user-to-computer random-access channel and one for the computer-to-user broadcast channel. The system was configured as a star network, allowing only the central node to receive transmissions in the random-access channel. All user TCUs received each transmission made by the central node in the broadcast channel. All transmissions were made in bursts at , with data and control information encapsulated in packets.

Each packet consisted of a 32-bit header and a 16-bit header parity check word, followed by up to 80 bytes of data and a 16-bit parity check word for the data. The header contained address information identifying a particular user so that when the Menehune broadcast a packet, only the intended user&#x27;s node would accept it.

== Legacy ==

In the 1970s ALOHA random access was employed in the nascent Ethernet cable based network and then in the Marisat (now Inmarsat) satellite network. 

In the early 1980s frequencies for mobile networks became available, and in 1985 frequencies suitable for what became known as Wi-Fi were allocated in the US. These regulatory developments made it possible to use the ALOHA random-access techniques in both Wi-Fi and in mobile telephone networks.

ALOHA channels were used in a limited way in the 1980s in 1G mobile phones for signaling and control purposes. In the late 1980s, the European standardization group GSM who worked on the Pan-European Digital mobile communication system GSM greatly expanded the use of ALOHA channels for access to radio channels in mobile telephony. In addition, SMS message texting was implemented in 2G mobile phones. In the early 2000s additional ALOHA channels were added to 2.5G and 3G mobile phones with the widespread introduction of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), using a slotted-ALOHA random-access channel combined with a version of the Reservation ALOHA scheme first analyzed by a group at BBN Technologies.

<text>Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem is the tenth on the list of mathematical problems that the German mathematician David Hilbert posed in 1900. It is the challenge to provide a general algorithm that, for any given Diophantine equation (a polynomial equation with integer coefficients and a finite number of unknowns), can decide whether the equation has a solution with all unknowns taking integer values.

For example, the Diophantine equation formula_1 has an integer solution: formula_2. By contrast, the Diophantine equation formula_3 has no such solution.

Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem has been solved, and it has a negative answer: such a general algorithm cannot exist. This is the result of combined work of Martin Davis, Yuri Matiyasevich, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson that spans 21 years, with Matiyasevich completing the theorem in 1970. The theorem is now known as Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem or the MRDP theorem (an initialism for the surnames of the four principal contributors to its solution).

When all coefficients and variables are restricted to be &quot;positive&quot; integers, the related problem of polynomial identity testing becomes a decidable (exponentiation-free) variation of Tarski&#x27;s high school algebra problem, sometimes denoted formula_4

==Background==
=== Original formulation ===
Hilbert formulated the problem as follows:

&quot;Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with rational integral numerical coefficients:&quot; &quot;To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.&quot;

The words &quot;process&quot; and &quot;finite number of operations&quot; have been taken to mean that Hilbert was asking for an algorithm. The term &quot;rational integral&quot; simply refers to the integers, positive, negative or zero: 0, ±1, ±2, ... . So Hilbert was asking for a general algorithm to decide whether a given polynomial Diophantine equation with integer coefficients has a solution in integers.

Hilbert&#x27;s problem is not concerned with finding the solutions. It only asks whether, in general, we can decide whether one or more solutions exist. The answer to this question is negative, in the sense that no &quot;process can be devised&quot; for answering that question. In modern terms, Hilbert&#x27;s 10th problem is an undecidable problem.

===Diophantine sets===
In a Diophantine equation, there are two kinds of variables: the parameters and the unknowns. The Diophantine set consists of the parameter assignments for which the Diophantine equation is solvable. A typical example is the linear Diophantine equation in two unknowns,

:formula_5,

where the equation is solvable if and only if the greatest common divisor formula_6 evenly divides formula_7. The set of all ordered triples formula_8 satisfying this restriction is called the &quot;Diophantine set&quot; defined by formula_5.
In these terms, Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem asks whether there is an algorithm to determine if the Diophantine set corresponding to an arbitrary polynomial is non-empty.

The problem is generally understood in terms of the natural numbers (that is, the non-negative integers) rather than arbitrary integers. However, the two problems are equivalent: any general algorithm that can decide whether a given Diophantine equation has an integer solution could be modified into an algorithm that decides whether a given Diophantine equation has a natural-number solution, and vice versa. By Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem, every natural number is the sum of the squares of four integers, so we could rewrite every natural-valued parameter in terms of the sum of the squares of four new integer-valued parameters. Similarly, since every integer is the difference of two natural numbers, we could rewrite every integer parameter as the difference of two natural parameters. Furthermore, we can always rewrite a system of simultaneous equations formula_10 (where each formula_11 is a polynomial) as a single equation formula_12.

=== Recursively enumerable sets ===

A recursively enumerable set can be characterized as one for which there exists an algorithm that will ultimately halt when a member of the set is provided as input, but may continue indefinitely when the input is a non-member. It was the development of computability theory (also known as recursion theory) that provided a precise explication of the intuitive notion of algorithmic computability, thus making the notion of recursive enumerability perfectly rigorous. It is evident that Diophantine sets are recursively enumerable (also known as semi-decidable). This is because one can arrange all possible tuples of values of the unknowns in a sequence and then, for a given value of the parameter(s), test these tuples, one after another, to see whether they are solutions of the corresponding equation. The unsolvability of Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem is a consequence of the surprising fact that the converse is true:
&quot;Every recursively enumerable set is Diophantine.&quot;
This result is variously known as Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem (because he provided the crucial step that completed the proof) and the MRDP theorem (for Yuri Matiyasevich, Julia Robinson, Martin Davis, and Hilary Putnam). Because &quot;there exists a recursively enumerable set that is not computable,&quot; the unsolvability of Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem is an immediate consequence. In fact, more can be said: there is a polynomial 
:formula_13
with integer coefficients such that the set of values of formula_14 for which the equation
:formula_15
has solutions in natural numbers is not computable. So, not only is there no general algorithm for testing Diophantine equations for solvability, but there is none even for this family of single-parameter equations.

==History==
==Applications==
The Matiyasevich/MRDP theorem relates two notions—one from computability theory, the other from number theory—and has some surprising consequences. Perhaps the most surprising is the existence of a &quot;universal&quot; Diophantine equation:

:&quot;There exists a polynomial&quot; formula_16 &quot;such that, given any Diophantine set&quot; formula_17 &quot;there is a number&quot; formula_18 &quot;such that&quot;
::formula_19

This is true simply because Diophantine sets, being equal to recursively enumerable sets, are also equal to Turing machines. It is a well known property of Turing machines that there exist universal Turing machines, capable of executing any algorithm.

Hilary Putnam has pointed out that for any Diophantine set formula_17 of positive integers, there is a polynomial

:formula_21

such that formula_17 consists of exactly the positive numbers among the values assumed by formula_23 as
the variables

:formula_24

range over all natural numbers. This can be seen as follows: If

:formula_25

provides a Diophantine definition of formula_17, then it suffices to set

:formula_27

So, for example, there is a polynomial for which the positive part of its range is exactly the prime numbers. (On the other hand, no polynomial can only take on prime values.) The same holds for other recursively enumerable sets of natural numbers: the factorial, the binomial coefficients, the fibonacci numbers, etc.

Other applications concern what logicians refer to as formula_28 propositions, sometimes also called propositions of &quot;Goldbach type&quot;. These are like Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, in stating that all natural numbers possess a certain property that is algorithmically checkable for each particular number. The Matiyasevich/MRDP theorem implies that each such proposition is equivalent to a statement that asserts that some particular Diophantine equation has no solutions in natural numbers. A number of important and celebrated problems are of this form: in particular, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, the Riemann hypothesis, and the four color theorem. In addition the assertion that particular formal systems such as Peano arithmetic or ZFC are consistent can be expressed as formula_28 sentences. The idea is to follow Kurt Gödel in coding proofs by natural numbers in such a way that the property of being the number representing a proof is algorithmically checkable.

formula_28 sentences have the special property that if they are false, that fact will be provable in any of the usual formal systems. This is because the falsity amounts to the existence of a counter-example that can be verified by simple arithmetic. So if a formula_28 sentence is such that neither it nor its negation is provable in one of these systems, that sentence must be true.

A particularly striking form of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem is also a consequence of the Matiyasevich/MRDP theorem:

Let

:formula_32

provide a Diophantine definition of a non-computable set. Let formula_33 be an algorithm that outputs a sequence of natural numbers formula_34 such that the corresponding equation

:formula_35

has no solutions in natural numbers. Then there is a number formula_18 that is not output by formula_33 while in fact the equation

:formula_38

has no solutions in natural numbers.

To see that the theorem is true, it suffices to notice that if there were no such number formula_18, one could algorithmically test membership of a number formula_34 in this non-computable set by simultaneously running the algorithm formula_33 to see whether formula_34 is output while also checking all possible formula_43-tuples of natural numbers seeking a solution of the equation

:formula_35

and we may associate an algorithm formula_33 with any of the usual formal systems such as Peano arithmetic or ZFC by letting it systematically generate consequences of the axioms and then output a number formula_34 whenever a sentence of the form

:formula_47

is generated. Then the theorem tells us that either a false statement of this form is proved or a true one remains unproved in the system in question.

==Further results==

We may speak of the &quot;degree&quot; of a Diophantine set as being the least degree of a polynomial in an equation defining that set. Similarly, we can call the &quot;dimension&quot; of such a set the fewest unknowns in a defining equation. Because of the existence of a universal Diophantine equation, it is clear that there are absolute upper bounds to both of these quantities, and there has been much interest in determining these bounds.

Already in the 1920s Thoralf Skolem showed that any Diophantine equation is equivalent to one of degree 4 or less. His trick was to introduce new unknowns by equations setting them equal to the square of an unknown or the product of two unknowns. Repetition of this process results in a system of second degree equations; then an equation of degree 4 is obtained by summing the squares. So every Diophantine set is trivially of degree 4 or less. It is not known whether this result is best possible.

Julia Robinson and Yuri Matiyasevich showed that every Diophantine set has dimension no greater than 13. Later, Matiyasevich sharpened their methods to show that 9 unknowns suffice. Although it may well be that this result is not the best possible, there has been no further progress. So, in particular, there is no algorithm for testing Diophantine equations with 9 or fewer unknowns for solvability in natural numbers. For the case of rational integer solutions (as Hilbert had originally posed it), the 4-squares trick shows that there is no algorithm for equations with no more than 36 unknowns. But Zhi Wei Sun showed that the problem for integers is unsolvable even for equations with no more than 11 unknowns.

Martin Davis studied algorithmic questions involving the number of solutions of a Diophantine equation. Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem asks whether or not that number is 0. Let formula_48 and let formula_49 be a proper non-empty subset of formula_33. Davis proved that there is no algorithm to test a given Diophantine equation to determine whether the number of its solutions is a member of the set formula_49. Thus there is no algorithm to determine whether the number of solutions of a Diophantine equation is finite, odd, a perfect square, a prime, etc.

The proof of the MRDP theorem has been formalized in Coq.

==Extensions of Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem==

Although Hilbert posed the problem for the rational integers, it can be just as well asked for many rings (in particular, for any ring whose number of elements is countable). Obvious examples are the rings of integers of algebraic number fields as well as the rational numbers.

There has been much work on Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem for the rings of integers of algebraic number fields. Basing themselves on earlier work by Jan Denef and Leonard Lipschitz and using class field theory, Harold N. Shapiro and Alexandra Shlapentokh were able to prove:
&quot;Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem is unsolvable for the ring of integers of any algebraic number field whose Galois group over the rationals is abelian.&quot;

Shlapentokh and Thanases Pheidas (independently of one another) obtained the same result for algebraic number fields admitting exactly one pair of complex conjugate embeddings.

The problem for the ring of integers of algebraic number fields other than those covered by the results above remains open. Likewise, despite much interest, the problem for equations over the rationals remains open. Barry Mazur has conjectured that for any variety over the rationals, the topological closure over the reals of the set of solutions has only finitely many components. This conjecture implies that the integers are not Diophantine over the rationals and so if this conjecture is true a negative answer to Hilbert&#x27;s Tenth Problem would require a different approach than that used for other rings.

<text>In the theory of vector spaces, a set of vectors is said to be &#x27; if there exists no nontrivial linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector. If such a linear combination exists, then the vectors are said to be &#x27;. These concepts are central to the definition of dimension.


A vector space can be of finite dimension or infinite dimension depending on the maximum number of linearly independent vectors. The definition of linear dependence and the ability to determine whether a subset of vectors in a vector space is linearly dependent are central to determining the dimension of a vector space.

== Definition ==
A sequence of vectors formula_1 from a vector space is said to be &quot;linearly dependent&quot;, if there exist scalars formula_2 not all zero, such that
:formula_3
where formula_4 denotes the zero vector.

This implies that at least one of the scalars is nonzero, say formula_5, and the above equation is able to be written as
:formula_6
if formula_7 and formula_8 if formula_9

Thus, a set of vectors is linearly dependent if and only if one of them is zero or a linear combination of the others.

A sequence of vectors formula_10 is said to be &quot;linearly independent&quot; if it is not linearly dependent, that is, if the equation
:formula_11
can only be satisfied by formula_12 for formula_13 This implies that no vector in the sequence can be represented as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in the sequence. In other words, a sequence of vectors is linearly independent if the only representation of formula_14 as a linear combination of its vectors is the trivial representation in which all the scalars formula_15 are zero. Even more concisely, a sequence of vectors is linearly independent if and only if formula_14 can be represented as a linear combination of its vectors in a unique way.

If a sequence of vectors contains the same vector twice, it is necessarily dependent. The linear dependency of a sequence of vectors does not depend of the order of the terms in the sequence. This allows defining linear independence for a finite set of vectors: A finite set of vectors is &quot;linearly independent&quot; if the sequence obtained by ordering them is linearly independent. In other words, one has the following result that is often useful.

A sequence of vectors is linearly independent if and only if it does not contain the same vector twice and the set of its vectors is linearly independent.

===Infinite case===
An infinite set of vectors is &quot;linearly independent&quot; if every nonempty finite subset is linearly independent. Conversely, an infinite set of vectors is &quot;linearly dependent&quot; if it contains a finite subset that is linearly dependent, or equivalently, if some vector in the set is a linear combination of other vectors in the set.

An indexed family of vectors is &quot;linearly independent&quot; if it does not contain the same vector twice, and if the set of its vectors is linearly independent. Otherwise, the family is said to be &quot;linearly dependent&quot;.

A set of vectors which is linearly independent and spans some vector space, forms a basis for that vector space. For example, the vector space of all polynomials in over the reals has the (infinite) subset as a basis.

== Geometric examples ==
* formula_17 and formula_18 are independent and define the plane P.
* formula_17, formula_18 and formula_21 are dependent because all three are contained in the same plane.
* formula_17 and formula_23 are dependent because they are parallel to each other.
* formula_17 , formula_18 and formula_26 are independent because formula_17 and formula_18 are independent of each other and formula_26 is not a linear combination of them or, equivalently, because they do not belong to a common plane. The three vectors define a three-dimensional space.
* The vectors formula_30 (null vector, whose components are equal to zero) and formula_26 are dependent since formula_32

=== Geographic location ===

A person describing the location of a certain place might say, &quot;It is 3 miles north and 4 miles east of here.&quot; This is sufficient information to describe the location, because the geographic coordinate system may be considered as a 2-dimensional vector space (ignoring altitude and the curvature of the Earth&#x27;s surface). The person might add, &quot;The place is 5 miles northeast of here.&quot; This last statement is &quot;true&quot;, but it is not necessary to find the location. 
In this example the &quot;3 miles north&quot; vector and the &quot;4 miles east&quot; vector are linearly independent. That is to say, the north vector cannot be described in terms of the east vector, and vice versa. The third &quot;5 miles northeast&quot; vector is a linear combination of the other two vectors, and it makes the set of vectors &quot;linearly dependent&quot;, that is, one of the three vectors is unnecessary to define a specific location on a plane.

Also note that if altitude is not ignored, it becomes necessary to add a third vector to the linearly independent set. In general, linearly independent vectors are required to describe all locations in -dimensional space.

== Evaluating linear independence ==

=== The zero vector ===

If one or more vectors from a given sequence of vectors formula_33 is the zero vector formula_4 then the vector formula_33 are necessarily linearly dependent (and consequently, they are not linearly independent). 
To see why, suppose that formula_36 is an index (i.e. an element of formula_37) such that formula_38 Then let formula_39 (alternatively, letting formula_40 be equal any other non-zero scalar will also work) and then let all other scalars be formula_41 (explicitly, this means that for any index formula_42 other than formula_36 (i.e. for formula_44), let formula_45 so that consequently formula_46). 
Simplifying formula_47 gives: 
:formula_48
Because not all scalars are zero (in particular, formula_49), this proves that the vectors formula_33 are linearly dependent.

As a consequence, the zero vector can not possibly belong to any collection of vectors that is linearly &quot;in&quot;dependent.

Now consider the special case where the sequence of formula_33 has length formula_52 (i.e. the case where formula_53). 
A collection of vectors that consists of exactly one vector is linearly dependent if and only if that vector is zero. 
Explicitly, if formula_54 is any vector then the sequence formula_54 (which is a sequence of length formula_52) is linearly dependent if and only if alternatively, the collection formula_54 is linearly independent if and only if formula_58

=== Linear dependence and independence of two vectors ===

This example considers the special case where there are exactly two vector formula_59 and formula_60 from some real or complex vector space. 
The vectors formula_59 and formula_60 are linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the following is true: 
# formula_59 is a scalar multiple of formula_60 (explicitly, this means that there exists a scalar formula_65 such that formula_66) or 
# formula_60 is a scalar multiple of formula_59 (explicitly, this means that there exists a scalar formula_65 such that formula_70). 
If formula_71 then by setting formula_72 we have formula_73 (this equality holds no matter what the value of formula_60 is), which shows that (1) is true in this particular case. Similarly, if formula_75 then (2) is true because formula_76 
If formula_77 (for instance, if they are both equal to the zero vector formula_4) then &quot;both&quot; (1) and (2) are true (by using formula_79 for both).

If formula_66 then formula_81 is only possible if formula_82 &quot;and&quot; formula_83; in this case, it is possible to multiply both sides by formula_84 to conclude formula_85 
This shows that if formula_81 and formula_83 then (1) is true if and only if (2) is true; that is, in this particular case either both (1) and (2) are true (and the vectors are linearly dependent) or else both (1) and (2) are false (and the vectors are linearly &quot;in&quot;dependent). 
If formula_66 but instead formula_71 then at least one of formula_65 and formula_60 must be zero. 
Moreover, if exactly one of formula_59 and formula_60 is formula_4 (while the other is non-zero) then exactly one of (1) and (2) is true (with the other being false).

The vectors formula_59 and formula_60 are linearly &quot;in&quot;dependent if and only if formula_59 is not a scalar multiple of formula_60 &quot;and&quot; formula_60 is not a scalar multiple of formula_59.

=== Vectors in R2 ===
Three vectors: Consider the set of vectors formula_101 formula_102 and formula_103 then the condition for linear dependence seeks a set of non-zero scalars, such that
:formula_104
or
:formula_105

Row reduce this matrix equation by subtracting the first row from the second to obtain,
:formula_106
Continue the row reduction by (i) dividing the second row by 5, and then (ii) multiplying by 3 and adding to the first row, that is
:formula_107

Rearranging this equation allows us to obtain
:formula_108
which shows that non-zero &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; exist such that formula_109 can be defined in terms of formula_110 and formula_111 Thus, the three vectors are linearly dependent.

Two vectors: Now consider the linear dependence of the two vectors formula_110 and formula_102 and check, 
:formula_114
or
:formula_115

The same row reduction presented above yields,
:formula_116
This shows that formula_117 which means that the vectors formula_110 and formula_119 are linearly independent.

=== Vectors in R4 ===
In order to determine if the three vectors in formula_120 
:formula_121
are linearly dependent, form the matrix equation,

:formula_122

Row reduce this equation to obtain,
:formula_123
Rearrange to solve for v3 and obtain,
:formula_124
This equation is easily solved to define non-zero &quot;a&quot;i,
:formula_125
where formula_126 can be chosen arbitrarily. Thus, the vectors formula_127 and formula_128 are linearly dependent.

=== Alternative method using determinants ===

An alternative method relies on the fact that formula_129 vectors in formula_130 are linearly independent if and only if the determinant of the matrix formed by taking the vectors as its columns is non-zero.

In this case, the matrix formed by the vectors is
:formula_131
We may write a linear combination of the columns as
:formula_132
We are interested in whether for some nonzero vector Λ. This depends on the determinant of formula_133, which is
:formula_134
Since the determinant is non-zero, the vectors formula_135 and formula_136 are linearly independent.

Otherwise, suppose we have formula_137 vectors of formula_129 coordinates, with formula_139 Then &quot;A&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;m&quot; matrix and Λ is a column vector with formula_137 entries, and we are again interested in &quot;A&quot;Λ = 0. As we saw previously, this is equivalent to a list of formula_129 equations. Consider the first formula_137 rows of formula_133, the first formula_137 equations; any solution of the full list of equations must also be true of the reduced list. In fact, if is any list of formula_137 rows, then the equation must be true for those rows.
:formula_146
Furthermore, the reverse is true. That is, we can test whether the formula_137 vectors are linearly dependent by testing whether
:formula_148
for all possible lists of formula_137 rows. (In case formula_150, this requires only one determinant, as above. If formula_151, then it is a theorem that the vectors must be linearly dependent.) This fact is valuable for theory; in practical calculations more efficient methods are available.

=== More vectors than dimensions ===
If there are more vectors than dimensions, the vectors are linearly dependent. This is illustrated in the example above of three vectors in formula_152

== Natural basis vectors ==

Let formula_153 and consider the following elements in formula_154, known as the natural basis vectors:

:formula_155

Then formula_156 are linearly independent.

== Linear independence of functions ==

Let formula_154 be the vector space of all differentiable functions of a real variable formula_158. Then the functions formula_159 and formula_160 in formula_154 are linearly independent.

=== Proof ===
Suppose formula_162 and formula_163 are two real numbers such that

:formula_164

Take the first derivative of the above equation:

:formula_165

for values of formula_166 We need to show that formula_167 and formula_168 In order to do this, we subtract the first equation from the second, giving formula_169. Since formula_160 is not zero for some formula_158, formula_172 It follows that formula_167 too. Therefore, according to the definition of linear independence, formula_174 and formula_160 are linearly independent.

== Space of linear dependencies ==

A linear dependency or linear relation among vectors is a tuple with scalar components such that

:formula_176

If such a linear dependence exists with at least a nonzero component, then the vectors are linearly dependent. Linear dependencies among form a vector space.

If the vectors are expressed by their coordinates, then the linear dependencies are the solutions of a homogeneous system of linear equations, with the coordinates of the vectors as coefficients. A basis of the vector space of linear dependencies can therefore be computed by Gaussian elimination.

==Generalizations==

===Affine independence===
A set of vectors is said to be affinely dependent if at least one of the vectors in the set can be defined as an affine combination of the others. Otherwise, the set is called affinely independent. Any affine combination is a linear combination; therefore every affinely dependent set is linearly dependent. Conversely, every linearly independent set is affinely independent.

Consider a set of formula_137 vectors formula_178 of size formula_129 each, and consider the set of formula_137 augmented vectors formula_181 of size formula_182 each. The original vectors are affinely independent if and only if the augmented vectors are linearly independent.

===Linearly independent vector subspaces===

Two vector subspaces formula_183 and formula_184 of a vector space formula_185 are said to be if formula_186 
More generally, a collection formula_187 of subspaces of formula_185 are said to be if formula_189 for every index formula_190 where formula_191
The vector space formula_185 is said to be a of formula_187 if these subspaces are linearly independent and formula_194

<text>The important cities of North Korea have self-governing status equivalent to that of provinces. Pyongyang, the largest city and capital, is classified as a chikhalsi (capital city), while three cities (see the list below) are classified as t&#x27;ŭkpyŏlsi (special city). Other cities are classified as si (city) and are under provincial jurisdiction, at the same level as counties (see Administrative divisions of North Korea).

==List==
;Notes:
* All population figures come from the 2008 North Korean census.
* Several former special cities have been re-merged with their provinces, including Chongjin, Hamhung and Kaesong.
* Rason was annexed into North Hamgyong Province in 2004, but was later promoted back to special city in 2010 to help manage it for foreign investment.
* Chosŏn&#x27;gŭl has replaced Hancha; Hancha has not been officially used in North Korea since the 1950s.

(Note: foundation dates are the dates the cities were legally founded as their current status by the North Korean government. They all existed as prior settlements before these dates.)

<doc id="101865" wikidata="Q165274" url="?curid=101865" title="Jacques Prévert">
<text>Jacques Prévert (; 4 February 1900 – 11 April 1977) was a French poet and screenwriter. His poems became and remain popular in the French-speaking world, particularly in schools. His best-regarded films formed part of the poetic realist movement, and include (1945). He published his first book in 1946.

==Life and education==
Prévert was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine and grew up in Paris. After receiving his &quot;Certificat d&#x27;études&quot; upon completing his primary education, he quit school and went to work in Le Bon Marché, a major department store in Paris. In 1918, he was called up for military service in the First World War. After this, he was sent to the Near East to defend French interests there.
He died of lung cancer in Omonville-la-Petite, on 11 April 1977. He had been working on the last scene of the animated movie &quot;Le Roi et l&#x27;Oiseau&quot; (&quot;The King and the Mockingbird&quot;) with his friend and collaborator Paul Grimault. When the film was released in 1980, it was dedicated to Prévert&#x27;s memory, and on opening night, Grimault kept the seat next to him empty. His dog Auto was given to a family friend after his death.

==Poetry==
When Prévert was attending primary school, he at first hated writing. Later, he participated actively in the Surrealist movement. Together with the writers Raymond Queneau and Marcel Duhamel, he was a member of the Rue du Château group. He was also a member of the agitprop theater company &quot;Groupe Octobre&quot; where he helped craft a left-wing cinema in support of the causes of the Popular Front. Prévert remained supportive of left-wing causes throughout his life. In 1971, he wrote a poem in support of the communist Angela Davis after her arrest.

Prévert&#x27;s poems were collected and published in his books: &quot;Paroles&quot; (&quot;Words&quot;) (1946), &quot;Spectacle&quot; (1951), &quot;La Pluie et le beau temps&quot; (&quot;Rain and Good Weather&quot;) (1955), &quot;Histoires&quot; (&quot;Stories&quot;) (1963), &quot;Fatras&quot; (1971) and &quot;Choses et autres&quot; (&quot;Things and Others&quot;) (1973). His poems are often about life in Paris and life after the Second World War. They are widely taught in schools in France, and frequently appear in French language textbooks published worldwide. Some, such as &quot;Déjeuner du Matin&quot;, are also often taught in American upper-level French classes, for the students to learn basics.

Some of Prévert&#x27;s poems, such as &quot;Les feuilles mortes&quot; (&quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;Addition&quot;, &quot;La grasse matinée&quot; (&quot;Sleeping in&quot;), &quot;Les bruits de la nuit&quot; (&quot;The sounds of the night&quot;) and &quot;Chasse à l&#x27;enfant&quot; (&quot;The hunt for the child&quot;) were set to music by Joseph Kosma—and in some cases by Germaine Tailleferre of Les Six, Christiane Verger, Marjo Tal, and Hanns Eisler. They have been sung by prominent French vocalists, including Marianne Oswald, Yves Montand, and Édith Piaf, as well as by the later American singers Joan Baez and Nat King Cole. In 1961, French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg paid tribute to &quot;Les feuilles mortes&quot; in his own song &quot;La chanson de Prévert&quot;. &quot;Les feuilles mortes&quot; was also translated into German by the German poet and Liedermacher (singer-songwriter) Wolf Biermann, titled &quot;Welke Blätter&quot;, and was performed by him and others.

The British remix DJs Coldcut released their own version in 1993. Another German version has been published and covered by Didier Caesar (alias Dieter Kaiser), which he named &quot;Das welke Laub&quot;. &quot;Les feuilles mortes&quot; also bookends Iggy Pop&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Préliminaires&quot;.

Prévert&#x27;s poems are translated into many languages worldwide. Many translators have translated his poems into English. The poet and translator Suman Pokhrel has translated some of his poems into Nepali.

==Films==
Prévert wrote a number of screenplays for the film director Marcel Carné. Among them were the scripts for (&quot;Bizarre, Bizarre&quot;, 1937), &quot;Quai des brumes&quot; (&quot;Port of Shadows&quot;, 1938), &quot;Le Jour se lève&quot; (&quot;Daybreak&quot;, 1939), &quot;Les Visiteurs du soir&quot; (&quot;The Night Visitors&quot;, 1942) and &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; (, 1945). The last of these regularly gains a high placing in lists of best films ever and earned him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.

His poems were the basis for a film by the director and documentarian Joris Ivens, &quot;The Seine Meets Paris&quot; (&quot;La Seine a rencontré Paris&quot;, 1957), about the River Seine. The poem was read as narration during the film by singer Serge Reggiani. In 2007, a filmed adaptation of Prévert&#x27;s poem &quot;To Paint the Portrait of a Bird&quot; was directed by Seamus McNally, featuring T.D. White and Antoine Ray- English translation by Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

Prévert had a long working relationship with Paul Grimault, also a member of Groupe Octobre. Together they wrote the screenplays of a number of animated movies, starting with the short &quot;The Little Soldier&quot; (&quot;Le Petit Soldat&quot;, 1947). They worked together until his death in 1977, when he was finishing &quot;The King and the Mocking Bird&quot; (&quot;Le Roi et l&#x27;Oiseau&quot;), a second version of which was released in 1980. Prévert adapted several Hans Christian Andersen tales into animated or mixed live-action/animated movies, often in versions loosely connected to the original. Two of these were with Grimault, including &quot;The King and the Mocking Bird&quot;, while another was with his brother Pierre Prévert (fr).

<text>PLUNA Líneas Aéreas Uruguayas S.A. was the flag carrier of Uruguay. It was headquartered in Carrasco, Montevideo and operated scheduled services within South America, as well as scheduled cargo and charter services from its hub at Carrasco International Airport.

On 5 July 2012, only two days after the carrier&#x27;s employees went on strike amid mounting financial difficulties, the Uruguayan government decided to close the airline down and liquidate it. The carrier was wholly owned by the government at the time of its closure.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===

The airline was established in September 1936, and started operations the following month, on 19 November 1936. It was set up by Jorge and Alberto Márquez Vaesa, two brothers who had obtained the necessary financial and technical support through the ambassador of the United Kingdom to Uruguay at the time, Sir Eugen Millington-Drake. Millington-Drake wrote in his memoirs that he suggested the airline be named using a memorable acronym, taking SABENA as an example. It was then decided on &quot;PLUNA&quot;, an acronym for &quot;Primeras Líneas Uruguayas de Navegación Aérea&quot; (). Millington-Drake knew De Havilland&#x27;s representative in Buenos Aires at the time, which helped in the acquisition of the airline&#x27;s first aircraft. The airline flew two five-seater de Havilland Dragonflys from Montevideo to Salto and Paysandú. The two planes were christened &quot;Churrinche&quot; and &quot;San Alberto&quot;, the latter in honor of the brothers&#x27; father. PLUNA flew 2,600 passengers in their first fiscal year, a huge success for that era. It also flew 20,000 pieces of mail and 70,000 newspapers.

The carrier saw the incorporation of both the Potez 62 and the Douglas DC-2 into its fleet in the early 1940s, the latter acquired from the U.S. government. Following the outbreak of World War II, PLUNA was forced to suspend operations between 1942 and 1944, due to the lack of spare parts. The delicate position PLUNA was in at this time led the Uruguayan Government to aid the company by boosting its stake to 85% on 16 October 1944. The first Douglas DC-3 entered PLUNA&#x27;s fleet in February 1946. The airline launched regular services to Porto Alegre, Brazil, in May 1948. The carrier later added the cities of Santa Cruz in Bolivia and Buenos Aires, Rosario and Córdoba in Argentina to its network.

=== Nationalisation ===
The airline became a wholly government-owned company on 12 November 1951. After World War II, PLUNA&#x27;s fleet included two Douglas DC-2s which were operated on the Montevideo–Paysandú–Salto route until they were retired in 1951. In the same year, a Douglas DC-3 and four de Havilland Herons were added to the fleet. The Herons only stayed in PLUNA&#x27;s fleet for a short time and by 1957, they had been sold. The DC-3s remained in service much longer, and in 1971, the last four of them were sold to the Fuerza Aérea Uruguaya.

São Paulo was added to the route network in January 1954. On 24 June 1958, the carrier entered the turbine era with the delivery of its first of three Vickers Viscounts four-engined turboprops purchased new from Vickers; it later acquired two Viscount 700s from Alitalia and three Viscount 800s from VASP.

PLUNA&#x27;s growth slowed considerably for the next three decades, but it entered the jet age soon after jets were introduced to the world, and added John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York, and Miami to its destinations, using Boeing 707 and Boeing 737 aircraft.

In the 1980s, PLUNA began flying to Madrid, Asunción, Rio de Janeiro and Santiago, but services to JFK and Miami were suspended. In the meantime, as the city of Punta del Este flourished as a major tourist destination, PLUNA benefited from that. During this time, an office was also opened in Tel Aviv, Israel.

=== Privatisation ===
The 1990s, saw financial trouble loom for PLUNA. In 1995, the company was transformed into a public–private partnership and the government sold 51% of the shares to a holding formed by an Argentine consortium named Tevycom and Uruguayan businessmen; the holding later sold half of its participation in PLUNA to Varig.

At , the airline had employees. At this time the fleet consisted of Boeing 737-200 Advanced and McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 to serve a network that included Asunción, Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Florianópolis, Madrid, Montevideo, Punta del Este, Rio de Janeiro, Rosario, Salvador, Santiago and São Paulo. By late , the airline&#x27;s major shareholders were the Government of Uruguay (49%) and Varig (49%), and private investors held the balance. When Varig entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 17 June 2005, it sought a bidder for its 49% stake in PLUNA. For almost a year, it looked as if it might go to Venezuela&#x27;s state-run Conviasa, but the deal officially fell through in .
On 4 January 2007, the Government of Uruguay started negotiations to sell 75% of it shares to a private consortium of investors from Germany, United States, Uruguay and Argentina called Leadgate Investment, a subsidiary of Latin American Regional Aviation Holding Corporation (LARAH), that committed to inject  million in the company. In July the same year, the government awarded 75% of PLUNA&#x27;s stock to LARAH, and the acquisition of seven Bombardier CRJ-900s in a deal worth  million was announced.

In late , PLUNA presented its new corporate image, developed by Australian design company Cato Partners. This new image is based on the interpretation of the name &quot;Uruguay&quot; as meaning &quot;river of the painted birds&quot; or &quot;river of the colorful birds&quot; (). The first of seven brand new CRJ900s that would be incorporated into the fleet during 2008 arrived in March that year; these new aircraft permitted increasing frequencies to existing routes, as well as expanding services to new destinations.

In , the Canadian airline holding company Jazz Air Income Fund invested  million in LARAH. The move gave this holding an indirect control of 25% of the Uruguayan flag carrier, as LARAH had a participation of 75% into PLUNA at that time; the Government of Uruguay held the balance.

In September and October 2010, three additional new CRJ900s aircraft were delivered from the Bombardier factory. In April 2011, three options were taken up for delivery at the end of 2011 and these were delivered between September and November 2011. With these additions, PLUNA&#x27;s fleet consisted of 13 airplanes, the highest number in its history.

===Collapse===
In early , PLUNA&#x27;s then CEO, Matías Campiani, disclosed that the airline might face collapse amid a financial distress that led to a loss of  million for the eight months ending in February the same year, partly due to the protectionism of the government of Argentina —where the carrier concentrated 21% of its operations— following the renationalisation of Aerolíneas Argentinas in 2008, and partly due to the slowdown of the Brazilian economy in the preceding months. Later on, with losses totalling  million, Leadgate disposed of their 75% stake in the airline, transferring it back to the Uruguayan government. By that time, that percentage of PLUNA&#x27;s stock was owned by LARAH, which was in turn 75% owned by Leadgate and 25% by Jazz Air. Despite being initially disclosed that Jazz Air was not interested in taking over the entire 75% stock, and that it was later informed that the Canadian airline was evaluating the acquisition, the government suspended PLUNA&#x27;s operations on —following a strike that started two days earlier, after failing to find new investors for the company. The government announced that both PLUNA&#x27;s fleet and routes would be auctioned. It seemed there were no plans for the government to have any stake in PLUNA&#x27;s successor.

In , the auction of the seven Bombardier aircraft that belonged to the liquidated carrier was delayed until as there were no bidders. Cosmo Airlines, a Spanish charter carrier, eventually purchased the seven aircraft at a price of $137 million. Regionally, the void created by PLUNA&#x27;s collapse benefited foreign airlines on some routes.

In 2016, a Uruguayan court concluded that no Leadgate executives were responsible for Pluna&#x27;s collapse. Two years later, in 2018 a Panamanian-based investment consortium named Caballero Verde S. de R.L. took ownership of LARAH, which still owned 75% of Pluna&#x27;s shares. The consortium plans to seek compensation from the Uruguayan government for Pluna&#x27;s demise.

== Destinations ==
, PLUNA linked Uruguay with two destinations in Argentina, one in Chile, one in Paraguay, and eight in Brazil. The following is a list of destinations that were served by PLUNA as part of its scheduled services throughout its history:

=== Codeshare agreements ===
PLUNA had a codeshare agreement with Iberia, which operates the Montevideo–Madrid–Montevideo route. Under the same codeshare agreement, passengers also connected from Madrid to many destinations within Spain and also to Frankfurt. PLUNA also announced a codeshare agreement with American Airlines, which would have placed PLUNA&#x27;s code on American&#x27;s Miami-Montevideo route, if it had government approval.

==Fleet==
===Fleet at bankruptcy===

Prior to its collapse, PLUNA&#x27;s fleet consisted of the following aircraft, .

===Historical fleet===
The carrier also operated the following aircraft types throughout its history:

== Accidents and incidents ==
PLUNA had only one fatal accident with the loss of ten crew members, the Aviation Safety Network records 3 hull-loss accidents/incidents for the airline.

*8 January 1946: A Douglas DC-2-124, registration CX-AEG, was destroyed during a thunderstorm in Uruguay.
*9 October 1962: A Douglas C-47A, registration CX-AGE, crashed during a final test flight. The crash occurred during takeoff from Carrasco International Airport, when the right wing grazed the runway, bouncing the aircraft and causing the right tire to burst, then bouncing the aircraft again causing the engine to smash into the ground at almost full throttle, and finally rolling over and coming to rest upside down. A fire broke out shortly afterwards. All 10 crew members died.
*11 May 1975: A Vickers 769D Viscount, registration CX-AQO, flying a scheduled Carrasco International Airport–Buenos Aires-Aeroparque service, ran off the end of the runway at the destination airport on landing. The damage wrote off the aircraft. All 57 passengers and crew survived the incident.

<doc id="101883" wikidata="Q36788" url="?curid=101883" title="Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan">
<text>Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ibn al-Hakam (; July/August 644 or June/July 647 – 9 October 705) was the fifth Umayyad caliph, ruling from April 685 until his death in October 705. A member of the first generation of born Muslims, his early life in Medina was occupied with pious pursuits. He held administrative and military posts under Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (), founder of the Umayyad Caliphate, and his own father, Caliph Marwan I (). By the time of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s accession, Umayyad authority had collapsed across the Caliphate as a result of the Second Fitna and had been reconstituted in Syria and Egypt during his father&#x27;s reign.

Following a failed invasion of Iraq in 686, Abd al-Malik focused on securing Syria before making further attempts to conquer the greater part of the Caliphate from his principal rival, the Mecca-based caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. To that end, he concluded an unfavorable truce with the reinvigorated Byzantine Empire in 689, quashed a coup attempt in Damascus by his kinsman, al-Ashdaq, the following year, and reincorporated into the army the rebellious Qaysi tribes of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) in 691. He then conquered Zubayrid Iraq and dispatched his general, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, to Mecca where he killed Ibn al-Zubayr in late 692, thereby reuniting the Caliphate under Abd al-Malik&#x27;s rule. The war with Byzantium resumed, resulting in Umayyad advances into Anatolia and Armenia, the destruction of Carthage and the recapture of Kairouan, the launchpad for the later conquests of western North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, in 698. In the east, al-Hajjaj had become Abd al-Malik&#x27;s viceroy and firmly established the caliph&#x27;s authority in Iraq and Khurasan, stamping out opposition by the Kharijites and the Arab tribal nobility by 702. Abd al-Malik&#x27;s final years were marked by a domestically peaceful and prosperous consolidation of power.

In a significant departure from his predecessors, rule over the Caliphate&#x27;s provinces was centralized under Abd al-Malik, following the elimination of his rivals. Gradually, loyalist Arab troops from Syria were tasked with maintaining order in the provinces as dependence on less reliable, local Arab garrisons was reduced. Tax surpluses from the provinces were forwarded to Damascus and the traditional stipends to veterans of the early Muslim conquests and their descendants were abolished, salaries being restricted to those in active service. The most consequential of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reforms were the introduction of a single Islamic currency in place of Byzantine and Sasanian coinage and the establishment of Arabic as the language of the bureaucracy in place of Greek and Persian in Syria and Iraq, respectively. His Muslim upbringing, the conflicts with external and local Christian forces and rival claimants to Islamic leadership all influenced Abd al-Malik&#x27;s efforts to prescribe a distinctly Islamic character to the Umayyad state. Another manifestation of this initiative was his founding of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the earliest archaeologically attested religious monument built by a Muslim ruler and the possessor of the earliest epigraphic proclamations of Islam and the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The foundations established by Abd al-Malik enabled his son and successor, al-Walid I (), who largely maintained his father&#x27;s policies, to oversee the Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s territorial and economic zenith. Abd al-Malik&#x27;s centralized government became the prototype of later medieval Muslim states.

==Early life==
Abd al-Malik was born in July/August 644 or June/July 647 in the house of his father Marwan ibn al-Hakam in Medina in the Hejaz (western Arabia). His mother was A&#x27;isha, a daughter of Mu&#x27;awiya ibn al-Mughira. His parents belonged to the Banu Umayya, one of the strongest and wealthiest clans of the Quraysh tribe. Muhammad was a member of the Quraysh, but was ardently opposed by the tribe before they embraced Islam in 630. Not long after, the Quraysh came to dominate Muslim politics. Abd al-Malik belonged to the first generation of born-Muslims and his upbringing in Medina, Islam&#x27;s political center at the time, was generally described as pious and rigorous by the traditional Muslim sources. He took a deep interest in Islam and possibly memorized the Qur&#x27;an.

Abd al-Malik&#x27;s father was a senior aide of their Umayyad kinsman, Caliph Uthman (). In 656, Abd al-Malik witnessed Uthman&#x27;s assassination in Medina, an &quot;event [that] had a lasting effect on him&quot; and contributed to his &quot;distrust&quot; of the townspeople of Medina, according to the historian A. A. Dixon. Six years later, Abd al-Malik distinguished himself in a campaign against the Byzantines as commander of a Medinese naval unit. He was appointed to the role by his distant cousin, Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (), founder of the Umayyad Caliphate. Afterward, he returned to Medina, where he operated under his father, who had become governor of the city, as the (secretary) of Medina&#x27;s (bureaucracy). As with the rest of the Umayyads in the Hejaz, Abd al-Malik lacked close ties with Mu&#x27;awiya, who ruled from his power base in Damascus in Syria. Mu&#x27;awiya belonged to the Sufyanid line of the Umayyad clan, while Abd al-Malik belonged to the larger Abu al-As line. When a revolt broke out in Medina in 683 against Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s son and successor, Caliph Yazid I (), the Umayyads, including Abd al-Malik, were expelled from the city. The revolt was part of the wider anti-Umayyad rebellion that became known as the Second Muslim Civil War. On the way to the Umayyad capital in Syria, Abd al-Malik encountered the army of Muslim ibn Uqba, who had been sent by Yazid to subdue the rebels in Medina. He provided Ibn Uqba with intelligence about Medina&#x27;s defenses. The rebels were defeated at the Battle of al-Harra in August 683, but the army withdrew to Syria after Yazid&#x27;s death later that year.

The deaths of Yazid and his successor, his son Mu&#x27;awiya II, in relatively quick succession in 683–684 precipitated a leadership vacuum in Damascus and the consequent collapse of Umayyad authority across the Caliphate. Most provinces declared their allegiance to the rival Mecca-based caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. In parts of Syria, older-established Arab tribes who had secured a privileged position in the Umayyad court and military, in particular the Banu Kalb, scrambled to preserve Umayyad rule. Marwan and his family, including Abd al-Malik, had since relocated to Syria, where Marwan met the pro-Umayyad stalwart Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, who had just been expelled from his governorship in Iraq. Ibn Ziyad persuaded Marwan to forward his candidacy for the caliphate during a summit of pro-Umayyad tribes in Jabiya hosted by the Kalbite chieftain Ibn Bahdal. The tribal nobility elected Marwan as caliph and the latter became dependent on the Kalb and its allies, who collectively became known as the &quot;Yaman&quot; in reference to their ostensibly shared South Arabian (Yamani) roots. Their power came at the expense of the Qaysi tribes, relative newcomers who had come to dominate northern Syria and the Jazira under Mu&#x27;awiya I and had defected to Ibn al-Zubayr. The Qays were routed by Marwan and his Yamani backers at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684, leading to a long-standing blood feud and rivalry between the two tribal coalitions. Abd al-Malik did not participate in the battle on religious grounds, according to the contemporary poems compiled in the anthology of Abu Tammam (d. 845).

==Reign==

===Accession===
Abd al-Malik was a close adviser of his father. He was headquartered in Damascus and became its deputy governor during Marwan&#x27;s expedition to conquer Zubayrid Egypt in late 684. Upon the caliph&#x27;s return in 685, he held a council in Sinnabra where he appointed Abd al-Malik governor of Palestine and designated him as his chosen successor, to be followed by Abd al-Malik&#x27;s brother, Abd al-Aziz. This designation abrogated the succession arrangements reached in Jabiya, which stipulated Yazid&#x27;s son Khalid would succeed Marwan, followed by another Umayyad, the former governor of Medina, Amr ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Ashdaq. Nonetheless, Marwan secured the oaths of allegiance to Abd al-Malik from the Yamani nobility. While the historian Gerald Hawting notes that Abd al-Malik was nominated despite his relative lack of political experience, Dixon maintains he was chosen &quot;because of his political ability and his knowledge of statecraft and provincial administration&quot;, as indicated by his &quot;gradual advance in holding important posts&quot; from an early age. Marwan died in April 685 and Abd al-Malik&#x27;s accession as caliph was peacefully managed by the Yamani nobles. He was proclaimed caliph in Jerusalem, according to a report by the 9th-century historian Khalifa ibn Khayyat, which the modern historian Amikam Elad considers to be seemingly &quot;reliable&quot;.

At the time of his accession, critical posts were held by members of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s family. His brother, Muhammad, was charged with suppressing the Qaysi tribes, while Abd al-Aziz maintained peace and stability as governor of Egypt until his death in 705. During the early years of his reign, Abd al-Malik heavily relied on the Yamani nobles of Syria, including Ibn Bahdal al-Kalbi and Rawh ibn Zinba al-Judhami, who played key roles in his administration; the latter served as the equivalent to the chief minister or of the later Abbasid caliphs. Furthermore, a Yamani always headed Abd al-Malik&#x27;s (elite security retinue). The first to hold the post was Yazid ibn Abi Kabsha al-Saksaki and he was followed by another Yamani, Ka&#x27;b ibn Hamid al-Ansi. The caliph&#x27;s (personal guard) was typically led by a (non-Arab Muslim freedman; plural: ) and staffed by .

===Early challenges===
Though Umayyad rule had been restored in Syria and Egypt, Abd al-Malik faced several challenges to his authority. Most provinces of the Caliphate continued to recognize Ibn al-Zubayr, while the Qaysi tribes regrouped under Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi and resisted Umayyad rule in the Jazira from al-Qarqisiya, a Euphrates river fortress strategically located at the crossroads of Syria and Iraq.

====Failure in Iraq====
Re-establishing Umayyad rule across the Caliphate was the major priority of Abd al-Malik. His initial focus was the reconquest of Iraq, the Caliphate&#x27;s wealthiest province. Iraq was also home to a large population of Arab tribesmen, the group from which the Caliphate derived the bulk of its troops. In contrast, Egypt, which provided significant income to the treasury, possessed a small Arab community and was thus a meager source of troops. The demand for soldiers was pressing for the Umayyads as the backbone of their military, the Syrian army, remained fractured along Yamani and Qaysi lines. Though the roughly 6,000 Yamani soldiers of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s predecessor were able to consolidate the Umayyad position in Syria, they were too few to reassert authority throughout the Caliphate. Ibn Ziyad, a key figure in the establishment of Marwanid power, set about enlarging the army by recruiting widely among the Arab tribes, including those which nominally belonged to the Qays faction.

Ibn Ziyad had been tasked by Abd al-Malik&#x27;s father with the reconquest of Iraq. At the time, Iraq and its dependencies were split between the pro-Alid forces of al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi in Kufa and the forces of Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s brother Mus&#x27;ab in Basra. In August 686, Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s 60,000-strong army was routed at the Battle of Khazir and he was slain, alongside most of his deputy commanders, at the hands of al-Mukhtar&#x27;s much smaller pro-Alid force led by Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar. The decisive defeat and the loss of Ibn Ziyad represented a major setback to Abd al-Malik&#x27;s ambitions in Iraq. He refrained from further major campaigns in the province for the next five years, during which Mus&#x27;ab defeated and killed al-Mukhtar and his supporters and became Iraq&#x27;s sole ruler.

Abd al-Malik shifted his focus to consolidating control of Syria. His efforts in Iraq had been undermined by the Qaysi–Yamani schism when a Qaysi general in Ibn Ziyad&#x27;s army, Umayr ibn al-Hubab al-Sulami, defected with his men mid-battle to join Zufar&#x27;s rebellion. Umayr&#x27;s subsequent campaign against the large Christian Banu Taghlib tribe in the Jazira sparked a series of tit-for-tat raids and further deepened Arab tribal divisions, the previously neutral Taghlib throwing in its lot with the Yaman and the Umayyads. The Taghlib killed Umayr in 689 and delivered his head to Abd al-Malik.

====Byzantine attacks and the treaty of 689====
Along Syria&#x27;s northern frontier, the Byzantines had been on the offensive since the failure of the First Arab Siege of Constantinople in 678. In 679, a thirty-year peace treaty was concluded, obliging the Umayyads to pay an annual tribute of 3,000 gold coins, 50 horses and 50 slaves, and withdraw their troops from the forward bases they had occupied on the Byzantine coast. The outbreak of the Muslim civil war allowed the Byzantine emperor Constantine IV () to extort territorial concessions and enormous tribute from the Umayyads. In 685, the emperor led his army to Mopsuestia in Cilicia, and prepared to cross the border into Syria, where the Mardaites, an indigenous Christian group, were already causing considerable trouble. With his own position insecure, Abd al-Malik concluded a treaty whereby he would pay a tribute of 1,000 gold coins, a horse and a slave for every day of the year.

Under Justinian II (), the Byzantines became more aggressive, though it is unclear whether they intervened directly as reported by the 9th-century Muslim historian al-Baladhuri or used the Mardaites to mount pressure on the Muslims: Mardaite depredations extended throughout Syria, as far south as Mount Lebanon and the Galilee uplands. These raids culminated with the short-lived Byzantine recapture of Antioch in 688. The setbacks in Iraq had weakened the Umayyads, and when a new treaty was concluded in 689, it greatly favored the Byzantines: according to the 9th-century Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, the treaty repeated the tribute obligations of 685, but now Byzantium and the Umayyads established a condominium over Cyprus, Armenia and Caucasian Iberia (modern Georgia), the revenue from which was to be shared between the two states. In exchange, Byzantium undertook to resettle the Mardaites in its own territory. The 12th-century Syriac chronicler Michael the Syrian, however, mentions that Armenia and Adharbayjan were to come under full Byzantine control. In reality, as the latter regions were not held by the Umayyads at this point, the agreement probably indicates a &quot;carte blanche&quot; by Abd al-Malik to the Byzantines to proceed against Zubayrid forces there. This arrangement suited both sides: Abd al-Malik weakened his opponent&#x27;s forces and secured his northern frontier, and the Byzantines gained territory and reduced the power of the side that was apparently winning the Muslim civil war. About 12,000 Mardaites were indeed resettled in Byzantium, but many remained behind, only submitting to the Umayyads in the reign of al-Walid I (). Their presence disrupted Umayyad supply lines and obliged them to permanently keep troops on standby to guard against their raids.

The Byzantine counteroffensive represented the first challenge against a Muslim power by a people defeated in the early Muslim conquests. Moreover, the Mardaite raids demonstrated to Abd al-Malik and his successors that the state could no longer depend on the quiescence of Syria&#x27;s Christian majority, which until then had largely refrained from rebellion. The modern historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship described the treaty of 689 as &quot;an onerous and completely humiliating pact&quot; and surmised that Abd al-Malik&#x27;s ability to pay the annual tribute in addition to financing his own wartime army relied on treasury funds accrued during the campaigns of his Sufyanid predecessors and revenues from Egypt.

====Revolt of al-Ashdaq and end of the Qaysi rebellion====
In 689/90, Abd al-Malik used the respite from the truce to initiate a campaign against the Zubayrids of Iraq, but was forced to return to Damascus when al-Ashdaq and his loyalists abandoned the army&#x27;s camp and seized control of the city. Al-Ashdaq viewed Abd al-Malik&#x27;s accession as a violation of the caliphal succession agreement reached in Jabiya. Abd al-Malik besieged his kinsman for sixteen days and promised him safety and significant political concessions if he relinquished the city. Though al-Ashdaq agreed to the terms and surrendered, Abd al-Malik remained distrustful of the former&#x27;s ambitions and executed him personally.

Zufar&#x27;s control of al-Qarqisiya, despite earlier attempts to dislodge him by Ibn Ziyad in 685/86 and the caliph&#x27;s governor in Homs, Aban ibn al-Walid ibn Uqba, in 689/90, remained an obstacle to the caliph&#x27;s ambitions in Iraq. In revenge for Umayr&#x27;s slaying, Zufar had intensified his raids and inflicted heavy casualties on the caliph&#x27;s tribal allies in the Jazira. Abd al-Malik resolved to command the siege of al-Qarqisiya in person in the summer of 691, and ultimately secured the defection of Zufar and the pro-Zubayrid Qays in return for privileged positions in the Umayyad court and army. The integration of the Qaysi rebels strongly reinforced the Syrian army, and Umayyad authority was restored in the Jazira. From then onward, Abd al-Malik and his immediate successors attempted to balance the interests of the Qays and Yaman in the Umayyad court and army. This represented a break from the preceding seven years, during which the Yaman, and particularly the Kalb, were the dominant force of the army.

===Defeat of the Zubayrids===


With threats in Syria and the Jazira neutralized, Abd al-Malik was free to focus on the reconquest of Iraq. While Mus&#x27;ab had been bogged down fighting Kharijite rebels and contending with disaffected Arab tribesmen in Basra and Kufa, Abd al-Malik was secretly contacting and winning over these same Arab nobles. Thus, by the time Abd al-Malik led the Syrian army into Iraq in 691, the struggle to recapture the province was virtually complete. Command of the army was held by members of his family, his brother Muhammad leading the vanguard and Yazid I&#x27;s sons Khalid and Abd Allah leading the right and left wings, respectively. Many Syrian nobles held reservations about the campaign and counseled Abd al-Malik not to participate in person. Nonetheless, the caliph was at the head of the army when it camped opposite Mus&#x27;ab&#x27;s forces at Maskin, along the Dujayl Canal. In the ensuing Battle of Maskin, most of Mus&#x27;ab&#x27;s forces, many of whom were resentful at the heavy toll he had exacted on al-Mukhtar&#x27;s Kufan partisans, refused to fight and his leading commander, Ibn al-Ashtar, fell at the beginning of hostilities. Abd al-Malik invited Mus&#x27;ab to surrender in return for the governorship of Iraq or any other province of his choice, but the latter refused and was killed in action.

Following his victory, Abd al-Malik received the allegiance of Kufa&#x27;s nobility and appointed governors to the Caliphate&#x27;s eastern provinces. Afterward, he dispatched a 2,000-strong Syrian contingent to subdue Ibn al-Zubayr in the Hejaz. The commander of the expedition, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, had risen through the ranks and would become a highly competent and efficient supporter of the caliph. Al-Hajjaj remained encamped for several months in Ta&#x27;if, east of Mecca, and fought numerous skirmishes with Zubayrid loyalists in the plain of Arafat. Abd al-Malik sent him reinforcements led by his , Tariq ibn Amr, who had earlier captured Medina from its Zubayrid governor. In March 692, al-Hajjaj besieged Ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca and bombarded the Ka&#x27;aba, the holiest sanctuary in Islam, with catapults. Though 10,000 of Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s supporters, including his sons, eventually surrendered and received pardons, Ibn al-Zubayr and a core of his loyalists held out in the Ka&#x27;aba and were killed by al-Hajjaj&#x27;s troops in September or October. Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s death marked the end of the civil war and the reunification of the Caliphate under Abd al-Malik. In a panegyric that the literary historian Suzanne Stetkevych asserts was intended to &quot;declare&quot; and &quot;legitimize&quot; Abd al-Malik&#x27;s victory, the caliph&#x27;s Christian court poet al-Akhtal eulogized him on the eve or aftermath of Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s fall as follows:
To a man whose gifts do not elude us, whom God has made victorious, so let him in his victory long delight!

He who wades into the deep of battle, auspicious his augury, the Caliph of God through whom men pray for rain.

When his soul whispers its intention to him it sends him resolutely forth, his courage and his caution like two keen blades.

In him the common weal resides, and after his assurance no peril can seduce him from his pledge.

— Al-Akhtal (640–708), (&quot;The tribe has departed&quot;)
After his victory, Abd al-Malik aimed to reconcile with the Hejazi elite, including the Zubayrids and the Alids, the Umayyads&#x27; rivals within the Quraysh. He relied on the Banu Makhzum, another Qurayshite clan, as his intermediaries in view of the Umayyad family&#x27;s absence in the region due to their exile in 683. Nevertheless, he remained wary of the Hejazi elite&#x27;s ambitions and kept a vigilant eye on them through his various governors in Medina. The first of these was al-Hajjaj, who was also appointed governor of Yemen and the Yamama (central Arabia) and led the Hajj pilgrim caravans of 693 and 694. Though he maintained peace in the Hejaz, the harshness of his rule led to numerous complaints from its residents and may have played a role in his transfer from the post by Abd al-Malik. A member of the Makhzum and Abd al-Malik&#x27;s father-in-law, Hisham ibn Isma&#x27;il, was ultimately appointed. During his tenure in 701–706 he was also known for brutalizing Medina&#x27;s townspeople.

===Consolidation in Iraq and the east===
Despite his victory, the control and governance of Iraq, a politically turbulent province from the time of the Muslim conquest in the 630s, continued to pose a major challenge for Abd al-Malik. He had withdrawn the Syrian army and entrusted to the Iraqis the defense of Basra from the Kharijite threat. Most Iraqis had become &quot;weary of the conflict&quot; with the Kharijites, &quot;which had brought them little but hardship and loss&quot;, according to Gibb. Those from Kufa, in particular, had grown accustomed to the wealth and comfort of their lives at home and their reluctance to undertake lengthy campaigns far from their families was an issue that previous rulers of Iraq had consistently encountered. Initially, the caliph appointed his brother Bishr governor of Kufa and another kinsman, Khalid ibn Abdallah, to Basra before the latter too was put under Bishr&#x27;s jurisdiction. Neither governor was up to the task, but the Iraqis eventually defeated the Najdiyya Kharijites in the Yamama in 692/93. The Azariqa Kharijites in Persia were more difficult to rein in, and following Bishr&#x27;s death in 694, the Iraqi troops deserted the field against them at Ramhormoz.

Abd al-Malik&#x27;s attempt at family rule in Iraq had proven unsuccessful, and he installed al-Hajjaj in the post instead in 694. Kufa and Basra were combined into a single province under al-Hajjaj, who, from the start of his rule, displayed a strong commitment to governing Iraq effectively. Against the Azariqa, al-Hajjaj backed al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra al-Azdi, a Zubayrid holdover with long experience combating the Kharijite rebels. Al-Muhallab finally defeated the Azariqa in 697. Concurrently, a Kharijite revolt led by Shabib ibn Yazid al-Shaybani flared up in the heart of Iraq, resulting in the rebel takeover of al-Mada&#x27;in and siege of Kufa. Al-Hajjaj responded to the unwillingness or inability of the war-weary Iraqis to face the Kharijites by obtaining from Abd al-Malik Syrian reinforcements led by Sufyan ibn al-Abrad al-Kalbi. A more disciplined force, the Syrians repelled the rebel attack on Kufa and killed Shabib in early 697. By 698, the Kharijite revolts had been stamped out. Abd al-Malik attached to Iraq Sistan and Khurasan, thus making al-Hajjaj responsible for a super-province encompassing the eastern half of the Caliphate. Al-Hajjaj made al-Muhallab deputy governor of Khurasan, a post he held until his death in 702, after which it was bequeathed to his son Yazid. During his term, al-Muhallab recommenced the Muslim conquests in Central Asia, though the campaign reaped few territorial gains during Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign.

Upon becoming governor, al-Hajjaj immediately threatened with death any Iraqi who refused to participate in the war efforts against the Kharijites. In an effort to reduce expenditure, he had lowered the Iraqis&#x27; pay to less than that of their Syrian counterparts in the province. By his measures, al-Hajjaj appeared &quot;almost to have goaded the Iraqis into rebellion, as if looking for an excuse to break them&quot;, according to the historian Hugh Kennedy. Indeed, conflict with the (Arab tribal forces who formed Iraq&#x27;s garrisons) came to a head beginning in 699 when al-Hajjaj ordered Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath to lead an expedition against Zabulistan. Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath and his commanders were wealthy and leading noblemen and bristled at al-Hajjaj&#x27;s frequent rebukes and demands and the difficulties of the campaign. In response, Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath and his army revolted in Sistan, marched back and defeated al-Hajjaj&#x27;s loyalists in Tustar in 701, and entered Kufa soon after. Al-Hajjaj held out in Basra with his Banu Thaqif kinsmen and Syrian loyalists, who were numerically insufficient to counter the unified Iraqi front led by Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath. Alarmed at events, Abd al-Malik offered the Iraqis a pay raise equal to the Syrians and the replacement of al-Hajjaj with Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath. Due to his supporters&#x27; rejection of the terms, Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath refused the offer, and al-Hajjaj took the initiative, routing Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim in April. Many of the Iraqis had defected after promises of amnesty if they disarmed, while Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath and his core supporters fled to Zabulistan, where they were dispersed in 702.

The suppression of the revolt marked the end of the Iraqi as a military force and the beginning of Syrian military domination of Iraq. Iraqi internal divisions, and the utilization of disciplined Syrian forces by Abd al-Malik and al-Hajjaj, voided the Iraqis&#x27; attempt to reassert power in the province. Determined to prevent further rebellions, al-Hajjaj founded a permanent Syrian garrison in Wasit, situated between the long-established Iraqi garrisons of Kufa and Basra, and instituted a more rigorous administration in the province. Power thereafter derived from the Syrian troops, who became Iraq&#x27;s ruling class, while Iraq&#x27;s Arab nobility, religious scholars and were their virtual subjects. Furthermore, the surplus taxes from the agriculturally rich Sawad lands were redirected from the to Abd al-Malik&#x27;s treasury in Damascus to pay the Syrian troops in the province. This reflected a wider campaign by the caliph to institute greater control over the Caliphate.

===Renewal of Byzantine wars in Anatolia, Armenia and North Africa===
Despite the ten-year truce of 689, war with Byzantium resumed following Abd al-Malik&#x27;s victory against Ibn al-Zubayr in 692. The decision to resume hostilities was taken by Emperor Justinian II, ostensibly because of his refusal to accept payment of the tribute in the Muslim currency introduced that year rather than the Byzantine &quot;nomisma&quot; (see below). This is reported solely by Theophanes and issues of chronology make this suspect; not all modern scholars accept its veracity. The real &quot;casus belli&quot;, according to both Theophanes and the later Syriac sources, was Justinian&#x27;s attempt to enforce his exclusive jurisdiction over Cyprus, and to move its population to Cyzicus in northwestern Anatolia, contrary to the treaty. Given the enormous advantages secured by the treaty for Byzantium, Justinian&#x27;s decision has been criticized by Byzantine and modern historians alike. However, the historian Ralph-Johannes Lilie points out that with Abd al-Malik emerging victorious from the civil war, Justinian may have felt it was only a matter of time until the caliph broke the treaty, and resolved to strike first, before Abd al-Malik could consolidate his position further.

The Umayyads decisively defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692 and parried a Byzantine counter-attack in 693/94 in the direction of Antioch. Over the following years, the Umayyads launched constant raids against the Byzantine territories in Anatolia and Armenia, led by the caliph&#x27;s brother Muhammad, and his sons al-Walid, Abd Allah, and Maslama, laying the foundation for further conquests in these areas under Abd al-Malik&#x27;s successors, which would culminate in the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople in 717–718. The military defeats inflicted on Justinian II contributed to the downfall of the emperor and his Heraclian dynasty in 695, ushering in a 22-year period of instability, in which the Byzantine throne changed hands seven times in violent revolutions, further aiding the Arab advance. In 698/99, Emperor Tiberios III () secured a treaty with the caliph for the return of the Cypriots, both those moved by Justinian II, as well as those subsequently deported by the Arabs to Syria, to their island. Beginning in 700, Abd al-Malik&#x27;s brother Muhammad subdued Armenia in a series of campaigns. The Armenians rebelled in 703 and received Byzantine aid, but Muhammad defeated them and sealed the failure of the revolt by executing the rebel princes in 705. As a result, Armenia was annexed into the Caliphate along with the principalities of Caucasian Albania and Iberia as the province of Arminiya.

Meanwhile, in North Africa, a Byzantine–Berber alliance had reconquered Ifriqiya and slain its governor, Uqba ibn Nafi, in the Battle of Vescera in 682. Abd al-Malik charged Uqba&#x27;s deputy, Zuhayr ibn Qays, to reassert the Arab position in 688, but after initial gains, including the slaying of the Berber ruler Kasila at the Battle of Mams, Zuhayr was driven back to Barqa (Cyrenaica) by Kasila&#x27;s partisans and slain by Byzantine naval raiders. In 695, Abd al-Malik dispatched Hassan ibn al-Nu&#x27;man with a 40,000-strong army to retake Ifriqiya. Hassan captured Byzantine-held Kairouan, Carthage and Bizerte. With the aid of naval reinforcements sent by Emperor Leontios (), the Byzantines recaptured Carthage by 696/97. After the Byzantines were repelled, Carthage was captured and destroyed by Hassan in 698, signaling &quot;the final, irretrievable end of Roman power in Africa&quot;, according to Kennedy. Kairouan was firmly secured as a launchpad for later conquests, while the port town of Tunis was founded and equipped with an arsenal on the orders of Abd al-Malik, who was intent on establishing a strong Arab fleet. Hassan continued his campaign against the Berbers, defeating them and killing their leader, the warrior queen al-Kahina, between 698 and 703. Afterward, Hassan was dismissed by Abd al-Aziz, and replaced by Musa ibn Nusayr, who went on to lead the Umayyad conquests of western North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula during the reign of al-Walid.

===Final years===
The last years of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign were generally characterized by the sources as a domestically peaceful and prosperous consolidation of power. The blood feuds between the Qays and Yaman, which persisted despite the former&#x27;s reconciliation with the Umayyads in 691, had dissipated toward the end of his rule. Dixon credits this to Abd al-Malik&#x27;s success at &quot;harnessing tribal feeling to the interests of the government, [while] at the same time suppressing its violent manifestations&quot;.

The remaining principal issue faced by the caliph was ensuring the succession of his eldest son, al-Walid, in place of the designated successor, Abd al-Aziz. The latter consistently refused Abd al-Malik&#x27;s entreaties to step down from the line of succession, but potential conflict was avoided when Abd al-Aziz died in May 705. He was promptly replaced as governor of Egypt by the caliph&#x27;s son Abd Allah. Abd al-Malik died five months later, on 9 October. The cause of his death was attributed by the historian al-Asma&#x27;i (d. 828) to the &#x27;Plague of the Maidens&#x27;, so-called because it originated with the young women of Basra before spreading across Iraq and Syria. He was buried outside of the Bab al-Jabiya gate of Damascus.

==Legacy==
Abd al-Malik is considered the most &quot;celebrated&quot; Umayyad caliph by the historian Julius Wellhausen. &quot;His reign had been a period of hard-won successes&quot;, in the words of Kennedy. The 9th-century historian al-Yaqubi described Abd al-Malik as &quot;courageous, shrewd and sagacious, but also... miserly&quot;. His successor, al-Walid, continued his father&#x27;s policies and his rule likely marked the peak of Umayyad power and prosperity. Abd al-Malik&#x27;s key administrative reforms, reunification of the Caliphate and suppression of all active domestic opposition enabled the major territorial expansion of the Caliphate during al-Walid&#x27;s reign. Three other sons of Abd al-Malik, Sulayman, Yazid II and Hisham, would rule in succession until 743, interrupted only by the rule of Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s son, Umar II (). With the exceptions of the latter and Marwan II (), all the Umayyad caliphs who came after Abd al-Malik were directly descended from him, hence the references to him as the &quot;father of kings&quot; in the traditional Muslim sources. The Umayyad emirs and caliphs who ruled in the Iberian Peninsula between 756 and 1031 were also his direct descendants. In the assessment of his biographer Chase F. Robinson, &quot;Mu&#x27;awiya may have introduced the principle of dynastic succession into the ruling tradition of early Islam, but Abd al-Malik made it work&quot;. (commander of the faithful) is the most referenced formal title of Abd al-Malik in coins, inscriptions and the early Muslim literary tradition. He is also referred to as (caliph of God) in a number of coins minted in the mid-690s, correspondence from his viceroy al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf and poetic verses by his contemporaries al-Akhtal, Jarir and al-Farazdaq.

Abd al-Malik&#x27;s concentration of power into the hands of his family was unprecedented; at one point, his brothers or sons held nearly all governorships of the provinces and Syria&#x27;s districts. Likewise, his court in Damascus was filled with far more Umayyads than under his Sufyanid predecessors, a result of the clan&#x27;s exile to the city from Medina in 683. He maintained close ties with the Sufyanids through marital relations and official appointments, such as according Yazid I&#x27;s son Khalid a prominent role in the court and army and wedding to him his daughter A&#x27;isha. Abd al-Malik also married Khalid&#x27;s sister Atika, who became his favorite and most influential wife.

After his victory in the civil war, Abd al-Malik embarked on a far-reaching campaign to consolidate Umayyad rule over the Caliphate. The collapse of Umayyad authority precipitated by Mu&#x27;awiya I&#x27;s death made it apparent to Abd al-Malik that the decentralized Sufyanid system was unsustainable. Moreover, despite the defeat of his Muslim rivals, his dynasty remained domestically and externally insecure, prompting a need to legitimize its existence, according to Blankinship. Abd al-Malik&#x27;s solution to the fractious tribalism which defined his predecessors&#x27; caliphate was to centralize power. At the same time, his response to the Byzantine–Christian resurgence and the criticism of Muslim religious circles, which dated from the beginning of Umayyad rule and culminated with the outbreak of the civil war, was to implement Islamization measures. The centralized administration he established became the prototype of later medieval Muslim states. In Kennedy&#x27;s assessment, Abd al-Malik&#x27;s &quot;centralized, bureaucratic empire... was in many ways an impressive achievement&quot;, but the political, economic and social divisions that developed within the Islamic community during his reign &quot;was to prove something of a difficult inheritance for the later Umayyads&quot;.

According to Wellhausen, government &quot;evidently became more technical and hierarchical&quot; under Abd al-Malik, though not nearly to the extent of the later Abbasid caliphs. As opposed to the freewheeling governing style of the Sufyanids, Abd al-Malik ruled strictly over his officials and kept interactions with them largely formal. He put an end to the provinces&#x27; retention of the lion&#x27;s share of surplus tax revenues, as had been the case under the Sufyanids, and had them redirected to the caliphal treasury in Damascus. He supported al-Hajjaj&#x27;s policy of collecting the poll tax, traditionally imposed on the Caliphate&#x27;s non-Muslim subjects, from the of Iraq and instructed Abd al-Aziz to implement this measure in Egypt, though the latter allegedly disregarded the order. Abd al-Malik may have inaugurated several high-ranking offices, and Muslim tradition generally credits him with the organization of the (postal service), whose principal purpose was to efficiently inform the caliph of developments outside of Damascus. He built and repaired roads that connected Damascus with Palestine and linked Jerusalem to its eastern and western hinterlands, as evidenced by seven milestones found throughout the region, the oldest of which dates to May 692 and the latest to September 704. The road project formed part of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s centralization drive, special attention being paid to Palestine due to its critical position as a transit zone between Syria and Egypt and Jerusalem&#x27;s religious centrality to the caliph.

===Institution of Islamic currency and Arabization of the bureaucracy===
A major component of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s centralization and Islamization measures was the institution of an Islamic currency. The Byzantine gold was discontinued in Syria and Egypt, the likely impetus being the Byzantines&#x27; addition of an image of Christ on their coins in 691/92, which violated Muslim prohibitions on images of prophets. To replace the Byzantine coins, he introduced an Islamic gold currency, the dinar, in 693. Initially, the new coinage contained depictions of the caliph as the spiritual leader of the Muslim community and its supreme military commander. This image proved no more acceptable to Muslim officialdom and was replaced in 696 or 697 with image-less coinage inscribed with Qur&#x27;anic quotes and other Muslim religious formulas. In 698/99, similar changes were made to the silver dirhams issued by the Muslims in the former Sasanian Persian lands in the eastern Caliphate. Depictions of the Sasanian king were consequently removed from the coinage, though Abd al-Malik&#x27;s new dirham retained its characteristically Sasanian silver fabric and wide flan. 


Shortly after the overhaul of the Caliphate&#x27;s currency, in circa 700, Abd al-Malik is generally credited with the replacement of Greek with Arabic as the language of the in Syria. The transition was carried out by his scribe Sulayman ibn Sa&#x27;d. Al-Hajjaj had initiated the Arabization of the Persian in Iraq, three years before. Though the official language was changed, Greek and Persian-speaking bureaucrats who were versed in Arabic kept their posts. The Arabization of the bureaucracy and currency was the most consequential administrative reform undertaken by the caliph. Arabic ultimately became the sole official language of the Umayyad state, but the transition in faraway provinces, such as Khurasan, did not occur until the 740s. According to Gibb, the decree was the &quot;first step towards the reorganization and unification of the diverse tax-systems in the provinces, and also a step towards a more definitely Muslim administration&quot;. Indeed, it formed an important part of the Islamization measures that lent the Umayyad Caliphate &quot;a more ideological and programmatic coloring it had previously lacked&quot;, according to Blankinship. In tandem, Abd al-Malik began the export of papyri containing the Muslim statement of belief in Greek to spread Islamic teachings in the Byzantine realm. This was a further testament to the ideological expansion of the Byzantine–Muslim struggle.

The increasingly Muslim character of the state under Abd al-Malik was partly a reflection of Islam&#x27;s influence in the lives of the caliph and the chief enforcer of his policies, al-Hajjaj, both of whom belonged to the first generation of rulers born and raised as Muslims. Having spent most of their lives in the Hejaz, the theological and legal center of Islam where Arabic was spoken exclusively and administrative offices were held solely by Arab Muslims, Abd al-Malik and his viceroy only understood Arabic and were unfamiliar with the Syrian and Greek Christian and Persian Zoroastrian officials of the . They stood in stark contrast to the Sufyanid caliphs and their governors in Iraq, who had entered these regions as youths and whose children were as acquainted with the native majority as with the Arab Muslim newcomers. According to Wellhausen, Abd al-Malik was careful not to offend his pious subjects &quot;in the careless fashion of [Caliph] Yazid&quot;, but from the time of his accession &quot;he subordinated everything to policy, and even exposed the Ka&#x27;ba to the danger of destruction&quot;, despite the piety of his upbringing and early career. Dixon challenges this view, attributing the Abbasid-era Muslim sources&#x27; portrayal of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s transformation in character after his accession and the consequent abandonment of his piety to their general hostility to Abd al-Malik, whom they variously &quot;accused of being a mean, treacherous and blood-thirsty person&quot;. Dixon nonetheless concedes that the caliph disregarded his early Muslim ideals when he felt political circumstances necessitated it.

===Reorganization of the army===
Abd al-Malik shifted away from his predecessors&#x27; use of Arab tribal masses in favor of an organized army. Likewise, Arab noblemen who had derived their power solely through their tribal standing and personal relations with a caliph were gradually replaced with military men who had risen through the ranks. These developments have been partially obscured by the medieval sources due to their continued usage of Arab tribal terminology when referencing the army, such as the names of the tribal confederations Mudar, Rabi&#x27;a, Qays and Yaman. According to Hawting, these do not represent the &quot;tribes in arms&quot; utilized by earlier caliphs; rather, they denote army factions whose membership was often (but not exclusively) determined by tribal origin. Abd al-Malik also established a Berber-dominated private militia called al-Waḍḍāḥiya after their original commander, the caliph&#x27;s al-Waddah, which helped enforce the authority of Umayyad caliphs through the reign of Marwan II.

Under Abd al-Malik, loyalist Syrian troops began to be deployed throughout the Caliphate to keep order, which came largely at the expense of the tribal nobility of Iraq. The latter&#x27;s revolt under Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath demonstrated to Abd al-Malik the unreliability of the Iraqi in securing the central government&#x27;s interests in the province and its eastern dependencies. It was following the revolt&#x27;s suppression that the military became primarily composed of the Syrian army. Consecrating this transformation was a fundamental change to the system of military pay, whereby salaries were restricted to those in active service. This marked an end to the system established by Caliph Umar (), which paid stipends to veterans of the earlier Muslim conquests and their descendants. While the Iraqi tribal nobility viewed the stipends as their traditional right, al-Hajjaj viewed them as a handicap restricting his and Abd al-Malik&#x27;s executive authority and financial ability to reward loyalists in the army. Stipends were similarly stopped to the inhabitants of the Hejaz, including the Quraysh. Thus, a professional army was established during Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign whose salaries derived from tax proceeds. The dependence on the Syrian army of his successors, especially Hisham (), scattered the army among the Caliphate&#x27;s multiple and isolated war fronts, most of them distant from Syria. The growing strain and heavy losses inflicted on the Syrians by the Caliphate&#x27;s external enemies and increasing factional divisions within the army contributed to the weakening and downfall of Umayyad rule in 750.

===Foundation of the Dome of the Rock===
In 685/86 or 688, Abd al-Malik began planning the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. Its dedication inscription mentions the year 691/92, which most scholars agree is the completion date of the building. It is the earliest archaeologically attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler and the building&#x27;s inscriptions contain the earliest epigraphic proclamations of Islam and of Muhammad. The inscriptions proved to be a milestone, as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures and almost always mention Muhammad. The Dome of the Rock remains a &quot;unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects&quot;, including as a &quot;work of art and as a cultural and pious document&quot;, according to historian Oleg Grabar.

Narratives by the medieval sources about Abd al-Malik&#x27;s motivations in building the Dome of the Rock vary. At the time of its construction, the caliph was engaged in war with Christian Byzantium and its Syrian Christian allies on the one hand and with the rival caliph Ibn al-Zubayr, who controlled Mecca, the annual destination of Muslim pilgrimage, on the other hand. Thus, one series of explanations was that Abd al-Malik intended for the Dome of the Rock to be a religious monument of victory over the Christians that would distinguish Islam&#x27;s uniqueness within the common Abrahamic religious setting of Jerusalem, home of the two older Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Christianity. The other main explanation holds that Abd al-Malik, in the heat of the war with Ibn al-Zubayr, sought to build the structure to divert the focus of the Muslims in his realm from the Ka&#x27;aba in Mecca, where Ibn al-Zubayr would publicly condemn the Umayyads during the annual pilgrimage to the sanctuary. Though most modern historians dismiss the latter account as a product of anti-Umayyad propaganda in the traditional Muslim sources and doubt that Abd al-Malik would attempt to alter the sacred Muslim requirement of fulfilling the pilgrimage to the Ka&#x27;aba, other historians concede this cannot be conclusively dismissed.

While his sons commissioned numerous architectural works, Abd al-Malik&#x27;s known building activities were limited to Jerusalem. As well as the Dome of the Rock, he is credited with constructing the adjacent Dome of the Chain, expanding the boundaries of the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif) to include the Foundation Stone around which the Dome of the Rock was built and building two gates of the Temple Mount (possibly the Mercy Gate and the Prophet&#x27;s Gate). Theophanes, possibly conserving an original Syro-Palestinian Melkite source, reports that Abd al-Malik sought to remove some columns from a Christian shrine at Gethsemane to rebuild the Ka&#x27;aba, but he was dissuaded by his Christian treasurer, Sarjun ibn Mansur (the father of John of Damascus), and another leading Christian, called Patrikios, from Palestine, who successfully petitioned Emperor Justinian II to supply other columns instead.

==Family and residences==
Abd al-Malik had children with several wives and (slave concubines; singular: ). He was married to Wallada bint al-Abbas ibn al-Jaz, a fourth-generation descendant of the prominent Banu Abs chieftain Zuhayr ibn Jadhima. She bore Abd al-Malik the sons al-Walid I, Sulayman, Marwan al-Akbar and a daughter, A&#x27;isha. From Caliph Yazid I&#x27;s daughter Atika, he had his sons Yazid II, Marwan al-Asghar, Mu&#x27;awiya and a daughter, Umm Kulthum. His wife A&#x27;isha bint Hisham ibn Isma&#x27;il, whom he divorced, belonged to the Makhzum clan and mothered Abd al-Malik&#x27;s son Hisham. He had a second wife from the Makhzum, Umm al-Mughira bint al-Mughira ibn Khalid, a great-granddaughter of the pre-Islamic leader of the Quraysh, Hisham ibn al-Mughira. From this marriage, Abd al-Malik had his daughter Fatima, who was wed to Umar II. 

From his marriage to Umm Ayyub bint Amr, a granddaughter of Caliph Uthman, Abd al-Malik had his son al-Hakam, who, according to the medieval Arab genealogists, died at a young age, contradicting a number of contemporary Arabic poems which suggest he lived into adulthood. Abd al-Malik also married A&#x27;isha bint Musa, a granddaughter of one of Muhammad&#x27;s leading companions, Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, and together they had a son, Bakkar, who was also known as Abu Bakr. Abd al-Malik married and divorced during his caliphate Umm Abiha, a granddaughter of Ja&#x27;far ibn Abi Talib, and Shaqra bint Salama ibn Halbas, a woman of the Banu Tayy. Abd al-Malik&#x27;s sons from his were Abd Allah, Maslama, Sa&#x27;id al-Khayr, al-Mundhir, Anbasa, Muhammad and al-Hajjaj, the last named after the caliph&#x27;s viceroy. At the time of his death, fourteen of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s sons had survived him, according to al-Yaqubi.

Abd al-Malik divided his time between Damascus and seasonal residences in its general vicinity. He spent the winter mostly in Damascus and Sinnabra near Lake Tiberias, then to Jabiya in the Golan Heights and Dayr Murran, a monastery village on the slopes of Mount Qasyoun overlooking the Ghouta orchards of Damascus. He would typically return to the city in March and leave again in the heat of summer to Baalbek in the Beqaa Valley before heading back to Damascus in early autumn. His Damascus residence was the Khadra Palace commissioned by Mu&#x27;awiya I and purchased by Abd al-Malik from Khalid ibn Yazid at the beginning of his reign.

<text>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. Founded in 1948, IUCN has become the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education. IUCN&#x27;s mission is to &quot;influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable&quot;.

Over the past decades, IUCN has widened its focus beyond conservation ecology and now incorporates issues related to sustainable development in its projects. IUCN does not itself aim to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. It tries to influence the actions of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice and through building partnerships. The organization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, which assesses the conservation status of species worldwide.

IUCN has a membership of over 1,400 governmental and non-governmental organizations from over 170 countries. Some 16,000 scientists and experts participate in the work of IUCN commissions on a voluntary basis. It employs over 900 full-time staff in more than 50 countries. Its headquarters are in Gland, Switzerland. Every four years, IUCN convenes for the IUCN World Conservation Congress where IUCN Members set the global conservation agenda by voting on recommendations and guide the secretariat&#x27;s work by passing resolutions and the IUCN Programme.

IUCN has observer and consultative status at the United Nations, and plays a role in the implementation of several international conventions on nature conservation and biodiversity. It was involved in establishing the World Wide Fund for Nature and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre. In the past, IUCN has been criticized for placing the interests of nature over those of indigenous peoples. In recent years, its closer relations with the business sector have caused controversy.

IUCN was established in 1948. It was initially called the International Union for the Protection of Nature (1948–1956) and has also been formerly known as the World Conservation Union (1990–2008).

==History==
===Establishment===
IUCN was established on 5 October 1948, in Fontainebleau, France, when representatives of governments and conservation organizations spurred by UNESCO signed a formal act constituting the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUPN). The initiative to set up the new organisation came from UNESCO and especially from its first director general, the British biologist Julian Huxley.

At the time of its founding IUCN was the only international organisation focusing on the entire spectrum of nature conservation (an international organisation for the protection of birds, now BirdLife International, had been established in 1922).

===Early years: 1948–1956===
IUCN (International Union for conservation of Nature) started out with 65 members in Brussels and was closely associated to UNESCO. They jointly organized the 1949 Conference on Protection of Nature Lake Success, US and drafted the first list of gravely endangered species. In the early years of its existence IUCN depended almost entirely on UNESCO funding and was forced to temporarily scale down activities when this ended unexpectedly in 1954. IUCN was successful in engaging prominent scientists and identifying important issues such as the harmful effects of pesticides on wildlife but not many of the ideas it developed were turned into action. This was caused by unwillingness to act on the part of governments, uncertainty about the IUCN mandate and lack of resources. In 1956, IUCN changed its name to International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

===Increased profile and recognition: 1956–1965===
During this period, the IUCN expanded its relations with UN-agencies and established links with the Council of Europe. IUCN&#x27;s best known publication, the Red Data Book on the conservation status of species, was first published in 1964.

IUCN began to play a part in the development of international treaties and conventions, starting with the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. 
Africa was the focus of many of the early IUCN conservation field projects. IUCN supported the &#x27;Yellowstone model&#x27; of protected area management, which severely restricted human presence and activity in order to protect nature.

The IUCN also suffered from restricted financing in its early years. For this reason, Tracy Philipps, secretary-general from 1955 to 1958, did not draw a salary during his period in office.

To establish a stable financial basis for its work, IUCN participated in setting up the World Wildlife Fund (1961) (now the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF) to work on fundraising to cover part of the operational costs of IUCN. Also in 1961, the IUCN headquarters moved from Belgium to Morges in Switzerland.

===Consolidating its position in the international environmental movement: 1966–1975===
During the 1960s, IUCN lobbied the UN General Assembly to create a new status for NGOs. Resolution 1296, adopted in 1968, granted &#x27;consultative&#x27; status to NGOs. IUCN itself was eventually accredited with six UN organizations. IUCN was one of the few environmental organisations formally involved in the preparations of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972). The Stockholm Conference eventually led to three new international conventions, with IUCN involved in their drafting and implementation:
* Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972). IUCN co-drafted the World Heritage Convention with UNESCO and has been involved as the official Advisory Body on nature from the onset.[8]
* CITES – the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (1974). IUCN is a signatory party and the CITES secretariat was originally lodged with IUCN.
* Ramsar Convention – Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (1975). The secretariat is still administered from IUCN&#x27;s headquarters.

IUCN entered into an agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP to provide regular reviews of world conservation. The income this generated, combined with growing revenue via WWF, put the organisation on relatively sound financial footing for the first time since 1948.

This period saw the beginning of a gradual change in IUCN&#x27;s approach to conservation in which it tried to become more appealing to the developing world.

===The World Conservation Strategy 1975–1985===
In 1975 IUCN started work on the &quot;World Conservation Strategy&quot; (1980). The drafting process, and the discussions with the UN agencies involved, led to an evolution in thinking within IUCN and growing acceptance of the fact that conservation of nature by banning human presence no longer worked. The Strategy was followed in 1982 by the &quot;World Charter for Nature&quot;, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, after preparation by IUCN.

In 1980, IUCN and WWF moved into shared new offices in Gland, Switzerland. This marked a phase of closer cooperation with WWF, but the close ties between IUCN and WWF were severed in 1985 when WWF decided to take control of its own field projects, which so far had been run by IUCN.

Sustainable development and regionalisation: 1985 to present day
In 1982, IUCN set up a Conservation for Development Centre within its secretariat. The Centre undertook projects to ensure that nature conservation was integrated in development aid and in the economic policies of developing countries. Over the years, it supported the development of national conservation strategies in 30 countries. Several European countries began to channel considerable amounts of bilateral aid via IUCN&#x27;s projects. Management of these projects was primarily done by IUCN staff, often working from the new regional and country offices IUCN set up around the world. This marked a shift within the organisation. Previously, the volunteer Commissions had been very influential, now the secretariat and its staff began to play a more dominant role. In 1989, IUCN moved into a separate building in Gland, close to the offices it had shared with WWF. Initially, the focus of power was still with the Headquarters in Gland but the regional offices and regional members&#x27; groups gradually got a bigger say in operations.

In 1991, IUCN (together with UNEP and WWF) published &quot;Caring for the Earth&quot;, a successor to the World Conservation Strategy.

Social aspects of conservation were now integrated in IUCN&#x27;s work; at the General Assembly in 1994 the IUCN mission was redrafted to its current wording to include the equitable and ecologically use of natural resources.

Closer to business: 2000 to present day
Since the creation of IUCN in 1948, IUCN Members have passed more than 300 resolutions that include or focus on business related activities.

The increased attention on sustainable development as a means to protect nature brought IUCN closer to the corporate sector. The members decided against this, but IUCN did forge a partnership with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. IUCN renewed a multi-year MOU (Memorandum of understanding) with WBCSD in December 2015.

In 1996, after decades of seeking to address specific business issues, IUCN&#x27;s Members asked for a comprehensive approach to engaging the business sector. Resolution 1.81 of the IUCN World Conservation Congress held that year &quot;urged IUCN Members and the Director General, based on the need to influence private sector policies in support of the Mission of IUCN, to expand dialogue and productive relationships with the private sector and find new ways to interact with members of the business community&quot;.

The IUCN Global Business and Biodiversity Program (BBP) was established in 2003 to influence and support private partners in addressing environmental and social issues. In 2004, the first IUCN Private Sector Engagement Strategy was developed (in response to Council Decision C/58/41). Most prominent in the Business and Biodiversity Program is the five-year collaboration IUCN started with the energy company Shell International in 2007.

IUCN has been involved in minimum energy consumption and zero-carbon construction since 2005 by integrating energy-saving materials, developed by Jean-Luc Sandoz in the footsteps of Julius Natterer.

Today, the Business and Biodiversity Programme continues to set the strategic direction, coordinate IUCN&#x27;s overall approach and provide institutional quality assurance in all business engagements. The Programme ensures that the Business Engagement Strategy is implemented through IUCN&#x27;s global thematic and regional programmes as well as helps guide the work of IUCN&#x27;s six Commissions.

===Championing Nature-based Solutions: 2009 to present day===
Nature-based solutions (NbS) use ecosystems and the services they provide to address societal challenges such as climate change, food security or natural disasters.

The emergence of the NbS concept in environmental sciences and nature conservation contexts came as international organisations, such as IUCN and the World Bank, searched for solutions to work with ecosystems rather than relying on conventional engineering interventions (such as a seawall), to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, while improving sustainable livelihoods and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.

At the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2016, IUCN Members agreed on a definition of nature-based solutions. Members also called for governments to include nature-based solutions in strategies to combat climate change.

==Current work==

=== IUCN Programme 2017–2020 ===
According to its website, IUCN works on the following themes: business, climate change, economics, ecosystems, environmental law, forest conservation, gender, global policy, marine and polar, protected areas, science and knowledge, social policy, species, water, and world heritage.

IUCN works on the basis of four-year programs, determined by the membership. In the IUCN Programme for 2017–2020 conserving nature and biodiversity is linked to sustainable development and poverty reduction. IUCN states that it aims to have a solid factual base for its work and takes into account the knowledge held by indigenous groups and other traditional users of natural resources.

The IUCN Programme 2017–2020 identifies three priority areas:

# Valuing and conserving nature.
# Promoting and supporting effective and equitable governance of natural resources.
# Deploying Nature Based Solutions to address societal challenges including climate change, food security, and economic and social development.

IUCN does not itself aim to directly mobilize the general public. Education has been part of IUCN&#x27;s work program since the early days but the focus is on stakeholder involvement and strategic communication rather than mass-campaigns.

===Habitats and species===

IUCN runs field projects for habitat and species conservation around the world. It produces the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems is applicable at local, national, regional, and global levels.

IUCN&#x27;s stated goal is to expand the global network of national parks and other protected areas and promote good management of such areas. In particular, it focuses on greater protection of the oceans and marine habitats.

=== Business partnerships ===
IUCN has a growing program of partnerships with the corporate sector on a regional, national and international level to promote sustainable use of natural resources.

=== National and international policy ===
On the national level, IUCN helps governments prepare national biodiversity policies. Internationally, IUCN provides advice to environmental conventions such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, CITES, and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. It advises UNESCO on natural world heritage.
It has a formally accredited permanent observer mission to the United Nations.
IUCN has official relations with the multiple other international bodies.

==Organizational structure==
As an organization, IUCN has three components: the member organizations, the six scientific commissions and the secretariat.

===Members===
IUCN Members are States, government agencies, international nongovernmental organizations, national nongovernmental organizations and indigenous peoples&#x27; organisations. In 2017, IUCN had 1400 members. The members can organize themselves in national or regional committees to promote cooperation. In 2016, there were 62 national committees and 7 regional committees. 

===Commissions===
The seven IUCN Commissions involve volunteer experts from a range of disciplines. They &#x27;assess the state of the world&#x27;s natural resources and provide the Union with sound know-how and policy advice on conservation issues&#x27;.
* Commission on Education and Communication (CEC): communication, learning and knowledge management in IUCN and the wider conservation community.
* Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy (CEESP): economic and social factors for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
* World Commission on Environmental Law (WCEL): developing new legal concepts and instruments and building the capacity of societies to employ environmental law for conservation and sustainable development.
* Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM): integrated ecosystem approaches to the management of natural and modified ecosystems.
* Species Survival Commission (SSC): technical aspects of species conservation and action for species that are threatened with extinction. Specialist groups of the SSC prepare endangered species recovery plans known as Species Action Plans, which are used to outline the conservation strategies of species.
* World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA): establishment and effective management of a network of terrestrial and marine protected areas.
* Climate Crisis Commission: established 2021.

===Secretariat===
The IUCN head office is in Gland, Switzerland. Eight regional offices headed by a director implement IUCN&#x27;s program in their respective territories. Since 1980, IUCN has established offices in more than 50 countries.

==Governance and funding==

===Governance===
The World Conservation Congress (Members&#x27; Assembly) is IUCN&#x27;s highest decision-making body. The congress convenes every four years. It elects the council, including the president, and approves IUCN&#x27;s work program for the next four years and budget.

The IUCN council is the principal governing body of IUCN. The council provides strategic direction for the activities of the Union, discusses specific policy issues and provides guidance on finance and the membership development of the Union. The council is composed of the president, four vice presidents (elected by the council from among its members), the treasurer, the chairs of IUCN&#x27;s six commissions, three regional councillors from each of IUCN&#x27;s eight statutory regions and a councillor from the state in which IUCN has its seat (Switzerland). IUCN&#x27;s current president is Razan Al Mubarak.

The council appoints a director general, who is responsible for the overall management of IUCN and the running of the secretariat. The current IUCN director general is Bruno Oberle. He succeeded Inger Andersen.

IUCN&#x27;s funding mainly comes from Official Development Assistance budgets of bilateral and multilateral agencies. This represented 61% of its income in 2012. Additional sources of income are the membership fees, as well as grants and project funding from foundations, institutions, and corporations.

==Influence and criticism==

===Influence===
IUCN is considered one of the most influential conservation organisations and, together with World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the World Resources Institute (WRI), is seen as a driving force behind the rise of the influence of environmental organisations at the UN and around the world.

It has established a worldwide network of governmental and non-governmental organisations, involves experts in the IUCN Commissions, has formal ties to international agreements and intergovernmental organisations and increasingly also partnerships with international business. The World Conservation Congress and the World Parks Congress events organised by IUCN are the largest gatherings of organisations and individuals involved in conservation worldwide.

According to some, IUCN has considerable influence in defining what nature conservation actually is. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems determine which species and natural areas merit protection. Through the Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas and the system of IUCN protected area categories IUCN influences how protected areas are managed.

===Criticism===
It has been claimed that the IUCN puts the needs of nature above those of humans, disregarding economic considerations and the interests of indigenous peoples and other traditional users of the land. Until the 1980s IUCN favored the &quot;Yellowstone Model&quot; of conservation which called for the removal of humans from protected areas. The expulsion of the Maasai people from Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area is perhaps the best known example of this approach.

This is linked to another criticism that has been directed at IUCN, namely that throughout its history it has mainly been &#x27;Northern focused&#x27;, i.e. had a West-European or North-American perspective on global conservation. Some critics point to the fact that many individuals involved in the establishment of IUCN had been leading figures in the British Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of Empire, which wanted to protect species against the impact of &#x27;native&#x27; hunting pressure in order to safeguard hunting by Europeans. The fact that, at least until the 1990s, most of IUCN staff, the chairs of the Commissions and the IUCN president came from western countries has also led to criticism.

More recently, activist environmental groups have argued that IUCN is too closely associated with governmental organisations and with the commercial sector. IUCN&#x27;s cooperation with Shell came in for criticism, also from its own membership. IUCN&#x27;s close partnership with Coca-Cola in Vietnam – where they have together been launching Coca-Cola-focused community centers – has also drawn some criticism and allegations of greenwashing. Its decision to hold the 2012 World Conservation Congress on Jeju Island, South Korea, where the local community and international environmental activists were protesting against the construction of a navy base also led to controversy.

==Publications==
IUCN has a wide range of publications, reports, guidelines, and databases (including the Global Invasive Species Database) related to conservation and sustainable development. It publishes or co-authors more than 100 books and major assessments every year, along with hundreds of reports, documents, and guidelines. In 2015, 76 IUCN articles were published in peer reviewed scientific journals.

A report, released at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney on 12 November 2014 showed that the 209,000 conservation reserves around the world now cover 15.4 per cent of the total land area. This is a step towards protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent of ocean environments on Earth by 2020 since an agreement between the world&#x27;s nations at the Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Japan in 2010.

<text>Vigevano (; ) is a (municipality) in the province of Pavia, in the Italian region of Lombardy. A historic art town, it is also renowned for shoemaking and is one of the main centres of Lomellina, a rice-growing agricultural district. Vigevano received the honorary title of city with a decree of Duke Francis II Sforza on 2 February 1532. It is famed for its Renaissance in the centre of the town. It is also known for the Rassegna Litteraria di Vigevano (Literary Review of Vigevano), an annual cultural event celebrating literature and the arts, which honours two distinguished personalities from the world of culture every year with the &quot;National Prize&quot; and the &quot;International Career Prize&quot;.

==History==
The earliest records of Vigevano date back to 963, when for the first time is mentioned in documents the castle of Vigevano. Vigevano was given in 1154 by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in Pavia.

Vigevano was accordingly besieged and taken by the Milanese in 1201 and again in 1275. In 1328 it finally surrendered to Azzone Visconti, and thereafter shared the political fortunes of Milan. The Church of San Pietro Martire (St Peter Martyr) was built, with the adjacent Dominican convent, by Filippo Maria Visconti in 1445. In the last years of Visconti domination it sustained a siege by Francesco Sforza. Once he was settled in power in Lombardy, Sforza arranged for Vigevano to be set up as the seat of a bishop and provided its revenues.

==Main sights==

===Castello Sforzesco===

Vigevano is crowned by the Castello Sforzesco, a stronghold rebuilt 1492–94 for Ludovico Maria Sforza (Ludovico il Moro), the great patron born in the town, who transformed the fortification/hunting lodge of Luchino Visconti (who in turn had re-used a Lombard fortress) into a rich noble residence, at the cusp of Gothic and Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci was his guest at Vigevano, as was Bramante, who is ascribed with the tall tower that watches over the piazza from the Castello Sforzesco. The old castle has a unique raised covered road, high enough for horsemen to ride through, that communicates between the new palace and the old fortifications; there is a Falconry, an elegant loggiato supported by 48 columns, and, in the rear area of the mastio, the Ladies&#x27; Loggia made for Duchess Beatrice d&#x27;Este.

===Piazza Ducale===
Vigevano&#x27;s main attraction is the Piazza Ducale, an elongated rectangle that is almost in the proportions 1:3, built for Ludovico Sforza, starting in 1492-93 and completed in record time, unusual for early Renaissance town planning. Piazza Ducale was actually planned to form a noble forecourt to his castle, unified by the arcades that completely surround the square, an amenity of the new North Italian towns built in the 13th century. The town&#x27;s main street enters through a sham arcaded façade that preserves the unity of the space as at the Place des Vosges. Ludovico demolished the former palazzo of the commune of Vigevano to create the space.

At the outside of town is the La Sforzesca, a rectangular villa-fortress with corner palace-towers, built in 1486 by Ludovico il Moro.

===Cathedral===

In the 17th century one end of the Piazza Ducale was enclosed by the concave Baroque façade of the Cathedral, cleverly adjusted to bring the ancient duomo into a line perpendicular to the axis of the piazza and centered on it.

The Cathedral was begun in 1532 under Duke Francesco II, who commissioned the design to Antonio da Lonate. The edifice was completed in 1606. The interior is on the Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles, and houses works by Macrino d&#x27;Alba, Bernardino Ferrari and others, as well as tempera polyptych of the school of Leonardo da Vinci.
==Economy==
For centuries, the city was a manufacturing centre, especially for the silk and cotton industry.

The key sector of Vigevano industry is shoemaking. Handily shoemaking began to expand during the First World War and, by the 1950s, Vigevano was known as Italy&#x27;s &quot;shoe capital&quot;.

<doc id="101888" wikidata="Q3243139" url="?curid=101888" title="List of fictional computers">
<text>Computers have often been used as fictional objects in literature, movies and in other forms of media. Fictional computers may be depicted as considerably more sophisticated than anything yet devised in the real world. Fictional computers may be referred to with a made-up manufacturer&#x27;s brand name and model number or a nickname.

This is a list of computers or fictional artificial intelligences that have appeared in notable works of fiction. The work may be about the computer, or the computer may be an important element of the story. Only static computers are included. Robots and other fictional computers that are described as existing in a mobile or humanlike form are discussed in a separate list of fictional robots and androids.

<doc id="101891" wikidata="Q1522271" url="?curid=101891" title="Gian-Carlo Rota">
<text>Gian-Carlo Rota (April 27, 1932 – April 18, 1999) was an Italian-American mathematician and philosopher. He spent most of his career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked in combinatorics, functional analysis, probability theory, and phenomenology.

==Early life and education==
Rota was born in Vigevano, Italy. His father, Giovanni, an architect and prominent antifascist, was the brother of the mathematician Rosetta, who was the wife of the writer Ennio Flaiano. Gian-Carlo&#x27;s family left Italy when he was 13 years old, initially going to Switzerland.

Rota attended the Colegio Americano de Quito in Ecuador, and graduated with an A.B. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1953 after completing a senior thesis, titled &quot;On the solubility of linear equations in topological vector spaces&quot;, under the supervision of William Feller. He then pursued graduate studies at Yale University, where he received a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1956 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;Extension Theory Of Ordinary Linear Differential Operators&quot;, under the supervision of Jacob T. Schwartz.

==Career==
Much of Rota&#x27;s career was spent as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he was and remains the only person ever to be appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics and Philosophy. Rota was also the Norbert Wiener Professor of Applied Mathematics.

In addition to his professorships at MIT, Rota held four honorary degrees, from the University of Strasbourg, France (1984); the University of L&#x27;Aquila, Italy (1990); the University of Bologna, Italy (1996); and Brooklyn Polytechnic University (1997).
Beginning in 1966 he was a consultant at Los Alamos National Laboratory, frequently visiting to lecture, discuss, and collaborate, notably with his friend Stanisław Ulam. He was also a consultant for the Rand Corporation (1966–71) and for the Brookhaven National Laboratory (1969–1973). Rota was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1982, was vice president of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) from 1995–97, and was a member of numerous other mathematical and philosophical organizations.

He taught a difficult but very popular course in probability. He also taught Applications of Calculus, differential equations, and Combinatorial Theory. His philosophy course in phenomenology was offered on Friday nights to keep the enrollment manageable. Among his many eccentricities, he would not teach without a can of Coca-Cola, and handed out prizes ranging from Hershey bars to pocket knives to students who asked questions in class or did well on tests.

Rota began his career as a functional analyst, but switched to become a distinguished combinatorialist. His series of ten papers on the &quot;Foundations of Combinatorics&quot; in the 1960s is credited with making it a respectable branch of modern mathematics. He said that the one combinatorial idea he would like to be remembered for is the correspondence between combinatorial problems and problems of the location of the zeroes of polynomials. He worked on the theory of incidence algebras (which generalize the 19th-century theory of Möbius inversion) and popularized their study among combinatorialists, set the umbral calculus on a rigorous foundation, unified the theory of Sheffer sequences and polynomial sequences of binomial type, and worked on fundamental problems in probability theory. His philosophical work was largely in the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl.

Rota founded the &quot;Advances in Mathematics&quot; journal in 1961.

==Death==
Rota died of atherosclerotic cardiac disease on April 18, 1999, apparently in his sleep at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<text>Thurrock () is a unitary authority area with borough status in the ceremonial county of Essex, England. It lies on the north bank of the River Thames immediately east of London and has over of riverfront including the Port of Tilbury, the principal port for London. Thurrock is within the London commuter belt and is an area of regeneration within the Thames Gateway redevelopment zone. The borough includes the northern ends of the Dartford Crossing.

The local authority is Thurrock Council, based in Grays. The borough also includes Purfleet-on-Thames, South Ockendon, Stanford-le-Hope and Tilbury, as well as other villages and surrounding areas. More than half of the borough is designated as Green Belt.

The neighbouring districts are the London Borough of Havering, Brentwood, Basildon and Castle Point. On the opposite side of the Thames are Gravesham and Dartford in Kent.

==History==
Mammoths once grazed in the Thurrock area and archaeologists unearthed the remains of a jungle cat. Humans have lived in the area since prehistoric times and the land has been farmed by the Romans and Anglo-Saxons. Thurrock has numerous archaeological sites including the major excavation at Mucking. The name &quot;Thurrock&quot; is a Saxon name meaning &quot;the bottom of a ship&quot;.

 Horndon-on-the-Hill was the site of an 11th century mint as well as the 15th century woolmarket which gives an indication of the area&#x27;s wealth in the 15th century. The narrowing of the river where Tilbury now stands meant it was important in the defence of London, and Henry VIII built three blockhouses, two on the Tilbury side and another on the Gravesend side of the river, following the end of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.

In 1381, villagers from Fobbing, Mucking and Stanford-le-Hope instigated the Peasants&#x27; Revolt when they were called to Brentwood to pay the poll tax. When they refused to pay, a riot ensued which was the catalyst for a mass protest across Essex and Kent.

Later, in 1588 Elizabeth I addressed her troops not far from the Tilbury blockhouse as the Spanish Armada sailed up the English Channel. Between 1670 and 1682, the Tilbury blockhouse was substantially rebuilt into a much larger fortification (Tilbury Fort) and Coalhouse Fort was built further down river, close to the second blockhouse. The importance of the forts in defending the country continued through Napoleonic times and into the two world wars. The land where Tilbury Town now stands was farmland and marsh grazing until the building of the docks in the 1890s. Thurrock includes the Bata village, built for workers of the shoe company in 1933. Eight homes and the factory are listed.
Historically, the area was renowned for mineral extraction, including clay, aggregates and notably the digging of huge amounts of chalk from the West Thurrock area for use in the now defunct cement industries. When chalk extraction ceased one of the disused pits was redeveloped as Lakeside Shopping Centre. A number of former pits have been used to form the Chafford Gorges Nature Reserve, managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust.

===Captain Kidd===
The body of Captain Kidd was displayed in Thurrock. He had been convicted of piracy and hanged on 23 May 1701, at &#x27;Execution Dock&#x27;, Wapping. His body was &quot;gibbeted&quot; — left to hang in an iron cage over the Thames at Tilbury Point — as a warning to future would-be pirates for twenty years. Some sources give the location where his body was exhibited as Tilbury Ness, but this may be an alternative name for the same place. There is some uncertainty as to whether his body was displayed at what is now called Coalhouse Point or at a site a few hundred yards up stream, close to the present Tilbury Docks.

===1953 Floods===
On 31 January 1953, the low-lying areas of Thurrock were inundated by the North Sea flood of 1953. The Van den Berghs and Jurgens margarine factory, which manufactured Stork margarine, was forced to stop production for many months. Since the output of this factory constituted one third of the country&#x27;s ration allocation, this led to a severe strain on the supply of margarine in the UK. Most schools in Thurrock were closed, either as a direct result of the flooding or in order to use them to help the relief effort. More than 1300 people in Tilbury and other low-lying areas were evacuated to schools on the higher ground. Chadwell St Mary Primary school was used as the main welfare centre for the homeless. By 15 February, most schools had returned to normal. The last to resume were the Landsdowne school in Tilbury and the newly opened Woodside Primary School – then called Tyrell Heath School. On Friday 13 February, the flooded areas were visited by the young Queen Elizabeth II Despite severe loss of life in nearby Canvey Island, only one person in Thurrock died as a result of the floods.

===Heritage plaques===
In 2002, a partnership between Thurrock Council, Thurrock Heritage Forum and the Thurrock Local History Society began an initiative to place heritage plaques marking the famous people, events and organisations associated with Thurrock. By September 2021 plaques included:
*Joseph Conrad
*Alice Mangold Diehl (Musician and Novelist, born in Aveley) 
*Dracula&#x27;s connection to Purfleet
*The arrival of the Empire Windrush at Tilbury on 21 June 1948

*Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s connection with the design of a lightning conductor for the Purfleet gunpowder magazine
*Henry de Grey, who gave his name to Grays
*Kate Luard, the much decorated Boer War and First World War nurse

===Administrative history===
The borough has its origins in the Orsett Poor Law Union, which had been created in 1835 covering a group of 18 parishes in southern Essex. Poor Law Unions subsequently formed the basis for later local government structures, with the Orsett Rural Sanitary District created in 1872 covering the same area. The parish of Grays Thurrock was made its own urban sanitary district in 1886.

Urban and rural sanitary districts were converted into urban districts and rural districts in 1894. Two further urban districts were later created from parts of the Orsett Rural District: the Tilbury Urban District in 1912 covering the parish of Chadwell St Mary, and the Purfleet Urban District in 1929 covering the three parishes of Aveley, South Ockendon and West Thurrock.

After 1929 the area therefore comprised four district-level authorities: one rural district, containing 13 civil parishes, and three urban districts:
*Grays Thurrock Urban District
*Purfleet Urban District
*Tilbury Urban District
*Orsett Rural District, with its parishes being:
**Bulphan
**Corringham
**East Tilbury
**Fobbing
**Horndon on the Hill
**Langdon Hills
**Little Thurrock
**Mucking
**North Ockendon
**Orsett
**Stanford-le-Hope
**Stifford
**West Tilbury

In 1936 the four districts were all abolished to create the Thurrock Urban District (subject to some minor boundary changes with surrounding areas, notably at North Ockendon). All the civil parishes within the area were merged at the same time to become a single parish called Thurrock.

The present-day borough of Thurrock was created in on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering almost the same area as the former Thurrock Urban District, which was abolished, with just a minor change on the border with Basildon to place the whole designated area for Basildon new town in that district. The civil parish of Thurrock was also abolished as part of the reforms and the area became an unparished area. The reformed Thurrock district was given borough status at the same time, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

Until 1998 Thurrock was a lower-tier district authority, with Essex County Council providing county-level services. Thurrock was made a unitary authority on 1 April 1998, taking over the county-level services. Thurrock remains part of the ceremonial county of Essex for the purposes of lieutenancy.

==Governance==

There is only one tier of local government in Thurrock, being the unitary authority of Thurrock Council. There are no civil parishes in the borough, with the whole borough being an unparished area.
The local authority is Thurrock Council. Elections are held in three years out of every four.

===Wider politics===
Thurrock is covered by two parliamentary constituencies. Thurrock includes most of the borough while South Basildon and East Thurrock includes some wards in the east of the borough.

==Geography==

Thurrock has a population of 175,500 people living in 90,500 homes. The Metropolitan Green Belt covers 70% of the borough. There are of land available for industrial use. There are seven conservation areas, 19 scheduled monuments, including the dovecote at High House Purfleet, and 239 listed buildings.

The borough contains ten Sites of Special Scientific Interest: 
*Globe Pit, Grays
*Grays Chalk Pit
*Lion Pit, Grays
*Purfleet Chalk Pits
*West Thurrock Lagoon and Marshes
*Inner Thames Marshes
*Vange and Fobbing Marshes
*Basildon Meadows
*Mucking Flats and Marshes
*Hangman&#x27;s Wood and Deneholes

Despite much of the borough being protected Green Belt land, Thurrock provides localised opportunities for further industrial and commercial development. The borough forms part of the Thames Gateway regeneration area, a corridor of opportunity that has been identified by central government as the area with greatest development and commercial potential in the country. Thurrock Development Corporation took over much of the borough&#x27;s planning functions from its creation in 2005 until its demise in March 2011.

Much of the population and commercial activity is centred along the riverfront. This includes many large and important industrial sites, including two large oil refineries, manufacturing industries, a container port, cruise liner terminal, distribution warehousing and one of Britain&#x27;s largest refuse disposal sites at the appropriately named settlement of Mucking. Thurrock is also home to the Lakeside Shopping Centre.

It is one of the few surviving examples of 1930s cinema architecture. It has the original cinema organ which can still be played. However, in the early 21st century the building became disused and faced dereliction. In September 2015 it was announced that J D Wetherspoon had bought the property for conversion to a public house.( Building of the Bata Shoes estate in East Tilbury was begun in 1933, and this is now a conservation area.JD Wetherspoon have since put the State Cinema building up for sale after announcing they would no longer be converting it to a public house January 2023

Chadwell St Mary has one of the few examples of a &quot;Sunspan&quot; house designed by the architect Wells Coates. Although built in the 1950s, Woodside Primary School&#x27;s architecture has been described as the slightly earlier &quot;ocean liner&quot; style of Art Deco. The building features a number of bricked curves and circular windows, while the wrought-iron banisters on the stairs are deliberately set to lean out at an angle.

Historically Thurrock had three grammar schools, Grays Thurrock School, Palmer&#x27;s School for Boys and Palmer&#x27;s School for Girls. In 1931, the Palmer&#x27;s schools became public schools with boarding, reverting back to grammar school status in 1944 under voluntary control. Grays Convent High School was an independent day school from its formation until 1969. There were also two selective secondary technical schools, Grays County Technical High School which is now an academy status comprehensive and Aveley County Technical High School, which merged with the Palmer&#x27;s schools in 1971 to form Palmer&#x27;s College.

Palmer&#x27;s College, now one half of USP College, is Thurrock&#x27;s local sixth form college for generalised further education, whilst the Thurrock Campus of South Essex College is the local sixth form college for vocational education. Palmer&#x27;s also offers courses at higher education. Other institutions of further education in Thurrock include the Thurrock Adult Community College, Osborne Sixth Form and Ortu Sixth Form Centre Stanford &amp; Corringham.

<text>Costumes worn on Halloween are traditionally based on frightening supernatural or folkloric beings. However, by the 1930s, costumes based on characters from mass media, such as film, literature, and radio, gained popularity. Halloween costumes have traditionally been worn mainly by young people, but since the mid-20th century, they have increasingly been worn by adults as well.

Dressing up is not strictly restricted to Halloween among Christians, with similar practices being observed on holidays like Christmas.

==History==
The custom of wearing costumes may have originated in a Celtic festival held on 31 October to mark the beginning of winter, with costumes worn to ward off evil spirits. It was called &quot;Samhain&quot; in Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man, and &quot;Calan Gaeaf&quot; in Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany. The festival is believed to have pre-Christian roots. After the Christianization of Ireland in the 5th century, some of these customs may have been retained in the Christian observance of All Hallows&#x27; Eve in that region—which continued to be called &quot;Samhain&quot;/&quot;Calan Gaeaf&quot;—blending the traditions of their ancestors with Christian ones. It was seen as a liminal time when the spirits or fairies (the &quot;Aos Sí&quot;) and the souls of the dead could more easily come into our world. It was believed that the &quot;Aos Sí&quot; needed to be propitiated to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter.

From at least the 16th century, the festival included mumming and guising, which involved people going house-to-house in costume (or in disguise), usually reciting verses or songs in exchange for food. It may have originally been a tradition whereby people impersonated the &quot;Aos Sí&quot;, or the souls of the dead, and received offerings on their behalf. Impersonating these beings, or wearing a disguise, was also believed to protect oneself from them. It is suggested that the mummers and guisers &quot;personify the old spirits of the winter, who demanded reward in exchange for good fortune&quot;. F. Marian McNeill suggests the ancient pagan festival included people wearing masks or costumes to represent the spirits, and that faces were marked (or blackened) with ashes taken from the sacred bonfire. In parts of southern Ireland, a man dressed as a &quot;Láir Bhán&quot; (white mare) led youths house-to-house reciting verses—some of which had pagan overtones—in exchange for food. If the household donated food it could expect good fortune from the &#x27;Muck Olla&#x27;; not doing so would bring misfortune. In 19th century England, youths went house-to-house with masked, painted, or blackened faces, often threatening to do mischief if they were not welcomed. In parts of Wales, men went about dressed as fearsome beings called &quot;gwrachod&quot;, while in some places, young people cross-dressed. Elsewhere in Europe, mumming and costumes were part of other yearly festivals. However, in the Celtic-speaking regions, they were &quot;particularly appropriate to a night upon which supernatural beings were said to be abroad and could be imitated or warded off by human wanderers&quot;.

It has also been suggested that the wearing of Halloween costumes developed from the custom of souling, which was practiced by Christians in parts of Western Europe from at least the 15th century. At Allhallowtide, groups of poor people would go door-to-door, collecting soul cakes – either as representatives of the dead or in return for saying prayers for them. An early reference to wearing costumes on Halloween comes from Scotland in 1585. There are many references to the custom during the 18th and 19th centuries in the Celtic countries of Scotland, Ireland, Mann, and Wales. It has been suggested that the custom comes from the Celtic festivals of Samhain and Calan Gaeaf, or from the practice of &quot;souling&quot; during the Christian observance of Allhallowtide. The Christian tradition of acknowledging the &quot;danse macabre&quot; is also suggested as the origin of dressing up on Halloween.

One 19th-century English writer said it &quot;used to consist of parties of children, dressed up in fantastic costume, who went round to the farmhouses and cottages, singing a song, and begging for cakes (spoken of as &quot;Soal-cakes&quot;), apples, money, or anything that the good wives would give them&quot;. The soulers typically asked for &quot;mercy on all Christian souls for a soul cake&quot;. Shakespeare mentioned the practice in his play &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; (1593). Christian minister Prince Sorie Conteh wrote on the wearing of costumes: &quot;It was traditionally believed that the souls of the departed wandered the earth until All Saints&#x27; Day, and All Hallows&#x27; Eve provided one last chance for the dead to gain vengeance on their enemies before moving to the next world. To avoid being recognized by any soul that might be seeking such vengeance, people would don masks or costumes to disguise their identities&quot;. In the Middle Ages, statues and relics of martyred saints were paraded through the streets at Allhallowtide. Some churches that could not afford these things had people dress as saints instead. Some believers continue the practice of dressing as saints, biblical figures, and reformers in Halloween celebrations today. Many Christians in continental Europe, especially in France, believed that on Halloween, &quot;the dead of the churchyards rose for one wild, hideous carnival,&quot; known as the &quot;danse macabre&quot;, which has often been depicted in church decoration. An article published by &quot;Christianity Today&quot; claimed the &quot;danse macabre&quot; was enacted at village pageants and court masques, with people &quot;dressing up as corpses from various strata of society&quot; and suggested this was the origin of Halloween costume parties.
The custom of guising at Halloween in North America was first recorded in 1911, when a newspaper in Kingston, Ontario reported children going &quot;guising&quot; around the neighborhood. In 19th century America, Halloween was often celebrated with costume parades and &quot;licentious revelries.&quot; However, efforts were made to &quot;domesticate&quot; the festival to conform with Victorian era morality. Halloween was made into a private rather than public holiday, celebrations involving liquor and sensuality de-emphasized, and only children were expected to celebrate the festival. Early Halloween costumes emphasized the gothic nature of Halloween and were aimed primarily at children. Costumes were also made at home or using items (such as make-up) that could be purchased and utilized to create a costume. But in the 1930s, A.S. Fishbach, Ben Cooper, Inc., and other firms began mass-producing Halloween costumes for sale in stores as trick-or-treating became popular in North America. Halloween costumes are often designed to imitate supernatural and scary beings. Costumes are traditionally those of monsters such as vampires, werewolves, zombies, ghosts, skeletons, witches, goblins, trolls, devils, etc. In more recent years, such science fiction-inspired characters include aliens and superheroes. There are also costumes of pop culture figures like presidents, athletes, celebrities, or characters in film, television, literature, etc. Another popular trend is for women (and, in some cases, men) to use Halloween as an opportunity to wear costumes that reveal more skin than might be socially acceptable otherwise. Young girls often dress as entirely non-scary characters for Halloween, including princesses, fairies, angels, animals, and flowers. 
Halloween costume parties generally take place on or around October 31, often on the Friday or Saturday before the holiday. Halloween parties are the 3rd most popular party type held in the United States, falling behind only to Super Bowl and New Year&#x27;s Eve parties.

==Economics==
Researchers surveyed for the National Retail Federation in the United States and found that 53.3% of consumers planned to buy a costume for Halloween 2005, spending $38.11 on average (up $10 from the year before). They were also expected to spend $4.96 billion in 2006, up significantly from just $3.3 billion the previous year. The troubled economy has caused many Americans to cut back on Halloween spending. In 2009, the National Retail Federation anticipated that American households would decrease Halloween spending by as much as 15% to $56.31. In 2013, Americans spent an estimated $6.9 billion to celebrate Halloween, including a predicted $2.6 billion on costumes (with more spent on adult costumes than for children&#x27;s costumes) and $330 million on pet costumes. In 2017, it was estimated that Americans would spend $9.1 billion on Halloween merchandise with $3.4 billion of that towards Halloween costumes. Another survey by NRF showed that 67% of Halloween shoppers would buy Halloween costumes, spending $3.2 billion in 2019. It was estimated that the Halloween spending in 2022 would reach $10.6 billion.

==Criticism==
Halloween costumes in the contemporary Western world sometimes depict people and things from present times and are sometimes read in terms of their political and cultural significance. Halloween costumes are sometimes denounced for cultural appropriation when they uncritically use stereotypical representations of other groups of people such as gypsies and Native Americans. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Secretary Julie Myers was involved in a scandal when she awarded &quot;Best Costume&quot; at the ICE Halloween party to an &#x27;escaped Jamaican prisoner&#x27; dressed in dreadlocks and blackface.

=== Sexism ===

Halloween costumes can also generate controversy through the overt sexualization of many women&#x27;s costumes – despite a surprisingly long history of it – even those intended for young girls. While costumes of various occupations like student, police officer, academia, clergy, or nursing do exist for men, they are often at least relatively accurate to the clothing a man employed in any of the fields would wear. Costumes for women are often far from what would be considered accurate of the clothing worn by women in those fields, and focus on the sexualization of the wearer and often the concept portrayed.

<text>Dolley Todd Madison (née Payne; May 20, 1768 – July 12, 1849) was the wife of James Madison, the fourth president of the United States from 1809 to 1817. She was noted for holding Washington social functions in which she invited members of both political parties, essentially spearheading the concept of bipartisan cooperation. Previously, founders such as Thomas Jefferson would only meet with members of one party at a time, and politics could often be a violent affair resulting in physical altercations and even duels. Madison helped to create the idea that members of each party could amicably socialize, network, and negotiate with each other without violence. By innovating political institutions as the wife of James Madison, Dolley Madison did much to define the role of the President&#x27;s spouse, known only much later by the title First Lady—a function she had sometimes performed earlier for the widowed Thomas Jefferson.

Madison also helped to furnish the newly constructed White House. When the British set fire to it in 1814, she was credited with saving Gilbert Stuart&#x27;s classic 1796 portrait of George Washington; she directed her personal slave Paul Jennings to save it. In widowhood, she often lived in poverty aggravated by her son John Payne Todd&#x27;s alcoholism and mismanagement of their Montpelier plantation. To relieve her debts, she sold off the plantation, its remaining enslaved people, and her late husband&#x27;s papers.

Surveys of historians conducted periodically by the Siena College Research Institute since 1982 have consistently found Madison to rank among the six most highly regarded first ladies by the assessments of historians.

==Early life and first marriage (1768–1793)==
Madison was born as Dolley Payne on May 20, 1768, at Paines Tavern in Person County, North Carolina to Mary Coles and John Payne Jr. and lived with her family in a log cabin in New Garden,  (present-day Greensboro), North Carolina. Her parents had married in 1761, uniting two prominent Virginian families. Little is known about the family&#x27;s life before 1793, when Madison was 25, because few documents have survived; Madison&#x27;s earliest known letter dates to 1783. Mary Coles was from a Quaker family and two years after their marriage the couple applied for membership in the Cedar Creek meeting. The application was considered for a very lengthy time before they were admitted in 1765. He would become a fervent member of the faith. The family had moved to New Garden, a Quaker community, in 1765. Madison was the family&#x27;s third child and first daughter. The family had an enslaved nursemaid.

In early 1769, the Paynes returned to Virginia for reasons that are unclear. Historians Catherine Allgor and Richard N. Côté have speculated in their biographical works on her that the family may have wanted to return to their extended family, become uncomfortable with the religion, faced local opposition, or failed at farming or business. Madison would later downplay her North Carolina birth, claiming herself to be a Virginian born when visiting an uncle in North Carolina. The family returned to Cedar Creek, where within four years they had moved at least twice. They eventually settled on a farm several miles outside of Scotchtown. Madison grew up on the farm, working the land with the rest of her family. She was given a strict Quaker upbringing and education, which Côté describes her as &quot;chafing&quot; under.

Madison grew close to her extended family in the area. She had three younger sisters (Lucy, Anna, and Mary) and four brothers (Walter, William Temple, Isaac, and John), two of whom were younger. Her father did not participate in the American Revolutionary War, as his faith practiced pacifism, and Allgor writes that Madison was seemingly little affected by it. By 1783 John Payne had emancipated his enslaved people, as did numerous slaveholders in the Upper South. Payne, as a Quaker, had long encouraged manumission, but the act was not legal in Virginia until 1782.

When Madison was 15, Payne moved his family to Philadelphia, at the time the second largest American city. They lived at 57 North Third Street, and transferred to the local Northern District Meeting. While living there, Madison often visited Haddonfield, New Jersey, where many Quakers lived. She also met Eliza Collins and Dorothea Abrahams in Philadelphia, with whom she became lifelong friends. During her early years, Payne likely received formal education, though it is not known what this was. Allgor concludes that it was likely better than most Americans at the time, while Côté notes that it was probably &quot;no more than a basic&quot; one. Madison grew into a young woman who Côté writes was described &quot;as one of the fairest of the fair&quot;.

Upon the family&#x27;s move to Philadelphia, John had attempted to build a career as a starch manufacturer, but the business failed in 1789. This was seen as a &quot;weakness&quot; at his Quaker meetings, for which he was expelled. He was devastated by this failure and died on October 24, 1792. Mary Payne initially made ends meet by opening her home as a boardinghouse beginning in 1791. Before his death, John had arranged Madison&#x27;s marriage to John Todd, a Philadelphia lawyer. According to Allgor, Madison had rejected marriage with Todd previously and John&#x27;s marriage arrangement was &quot;manipulation&quot;. Conversely, Côté considers their marriage to have been &quot;for love, not just duty&quot;. They were married on January 7, 1790, at a Quaker meeting house. Madison&#x27;s friend Eliza Collins was her bridesmaid. The couple moved several blocks away into a high-quality neighborhood.

===Marriage and family===
Madison and Todd had two sons, John Payne (called Payne, born February 29, 1792) and William Temple (born July 4, 1793). According to Allgor, their marriage grew into a &quot;a loving happy partnership.&quot; Madison&#x27;s sister Anna Payne moved in with them.

In August 1793, a yellow fever epidemic broke out in Philadelphia, killing 5,019 people in four months. Madison was hit particularly hard, losing her husband, son William, mother-in-law, and father-in-law. Two of her older brothers died just two years later, and she &quot;never fully recovered&quot; from the emotional toll of these deaths. 

While undergoing the loss of much of her family, she also had to take care of her surviving son without financial support. Her husband had left her money in his will, but the executor, her brother-in-law, withheld the funds, and she sued him for what she was owed. Aaron Burr, who had once stayed at the boarding house of Madison&#x27;s mother, assisted her in these efforts, offering legal advice. In a will, written around that time, Burr was named the guardian of Madison&#x27;s only surviving child.

==Second marriage (1794–1800)==
Madison, at the time named Dolley Todd, soon met James Madison. Their relationship was facilitated by Aaron Burr, a longtime friend of Madison. In May 1794, Burr made the formal introduction between the young widow and Madison, who at 43 was a longstanding bachelor 17 years her senior. A brisk courtship followed, and by August she had accepted his marriage proposal. As he was not a Quaker, she was expelled from the Society of Friends for marrying outside her faith, after which she began attending Episcopal services. Despite her Quaker upbringing, there is no evidence that she disapproved of James as a slaveholder. They were married on September 15, 1794, and lived in Philadelphia for the next three years.

In 1797, after eight years in the House of Representatives, James Madison retired from politics. He returned with his family to Montpelier, the Madison family plantation in Orange County, Virginia. There they expanded the house and settled in. Thomas Jefferson, in 1800 elected president of the United States, asked James Madison to serve as his secretary of state. Madison accepted and moved with Dolley Madison, her son Payne, her sister Anna, and their domestic servants (who were all enslaved people) to Washington. They took a large house on F Street, as Dolley Madison believed that entertaining would be important in the new capital.

==In Washington (1801–1817)==

Madison worked with the architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe to furnish the White House, the first official residence built for the president of the United States. She sometimes served as widower Jefferson&#x27;s hostess for official ceremonial functions. Madison would become a crucial part of the Washington social circle, befriending the wives of numerous diplomats, among them Sarah Martinez de Yrujo, wife of the ambassador of Spain, and Marie-Angelique Turreau, wife of the French ambassador. Her charm precipitated a diplomatic crisis, called the Merry Affair, after Jefferson escorted Madison to the dining room instead of the wife of Anthony Merry, English diplomat to the U.S., in a major faux pas.

In the approach to the 1808 presidential election, with Thomas Jefferson ready to retire, the Democratic-Republican caucus nominated James Madison to succeed him. He was elected the fourth President of the United States, serving two terms from 1809 to 1817, and Dolley Madison became the official White House hostess. She had often been the unofficial hostess at the White House during Jefferson&#x27;s presidency. The term &quot;first lady&quot; was not yet in use, but her role as hostess became official when her husband assumed the presidency. Madison helped define the official functions, decorated the Executive Mansion, and welcomed visitors in her drawing room. She was renowned for her social graces and hospitality, and contributed to her husband&#x27;s popularity as president. She was the only First Lady given an honorary seat on the floor of Congress, and the first American to respond to a telegraph message. In 1812, James was reelected. Later that year, he delivered a war request to Congress, signalling the beginning of the War of 1812.

=== Burning of Washington (1814) ===

The United States declared war in 1812 and invaded Canada in 1813, and a British force attacked Washington in 1814. As it approached and the White House staff prepared to flee, Dolley ordered Paul Jennings, her personal servant, to save the Stuart painting, a copy of the Lansdowne portrait, of George Washington. She wrote in a letter to her sister at 3 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon of August 23:

Our kind friend Mr. Carroll has come to hasten my departure, and in a very bad humor with me, because I insist on waiting until the large picture of General Washington is secured, and it requires to be unscrewed from the wall. The process was found too tedious for these perilous moments; I have ordered the frame to be broken and the canvas taken out. . . . It is done, and the precious portrait placed in the hands of two gentlemen from New York for safe keeping. On handing the canvas to the gentlemen in question, Messrs. Barker and Depeyster, Mr. Sioussat cautioned them against rolling it up, saying that it would destroy the portrait. He was moved to this because Mr. Barker started to roll it up for greater convenience for carrying.

Popular accounts during and after the war years portrayed Dolley Madison as the one who removed the painting, and she became a national heroine. An 1865 memoir by Jennings stated that she had ordered him to save the painting, and that Jean Pierre Sioussat and a gardener, McGraw, were the ones who removed it from the wall. Early twentieth-century historians noted that Sioussat had directed the servants, many of whom were enslaved people, in the crisis, and that they were the ones who actually preserved the painting.

Dolley Madison hurried away in her waiting carriage, along with other families fleeing the city. They went to Georgetown and the next day crossed over the Potomac into Virginia. When the couple returned to Washington, the White House was uninhabitable and Dolley and James Madison moved into The Octagon House.

==In Montpelier (1817–1837)==

Dolley and James Madison returned to the Montpelier plantation in Orange County, Virginia, on April 6, 1817, a month after his retirement from the presidency.

In 1830, Dolley Madison&#x27;s son Payne Todd, who had never found a career, went to debtors&#x27; prison in Philadelphia, and the Madisons sold land in Kentucky and mortgaged half the Montpelier plantation to pay his debts.

James Madison died at Montpelier on June 28, 1836. He was 85 years old. Dolley remained at Montpelier for a year. Her niece Anna Payne moved in with her, and Todd came for a lengthy stay. During this time, Madison organized and copied her husband&#x27;s papers. Congress authorized $55,000 as payment for editing and publishing seven volumes of these papers, including James&#x27;s notes on the 1787 convention.

In the fall of 1837, Dolley returned to Washington, charging Todd with the care of the plantation. She and her sister Anna moved into a house, bought by Anna and her husband Richard Cutts, on Lafayette Square. Dolley took Paul Jennings with her as a butler, forcing him to leave his wife and children in Virginia.

==In Washington (1837–1849)==
While Dolley Madison was living in Washington, Payne Todd was unable to manage the plantation, due to alcoholism and related illness. She tried to raise money by selling the rest of the president&#x27;s papers, but was unable to find a buyer. Jennings attempted to negotiate purchasing his freedom; she had previously written a will in 1841 which would free Jennings after her death, though not her other slaves. She instead sold him to an insurance agent for $200 (~$ in ) in 1846. Six months later, Senator Daniel Webster intervened to buy him from the new owner and gave Jennings his freedom, for which he repaid the senator in work. Madison sold Montpelier, its remaining enslaved people, and the furnishings to pay off outstanding debts. Jennings later recalled in his memoir,

In the last days of her life, before Congress purchased her husband&#x27;s papers, she was in a state of absolute poverty, and I think sometimes suffered for the necessaries of life. While I was a servant to Mr. Webster, he often sent me to her with a market-basket full of provisions, and told me whenever I saw anything in the house that I thought she was in need of, to take it to her. I often did this, and occasionally gave her small sums from my own pocket, though I had years before bought my freedom of her.

In 1848, Congress agreed to buy the rest of James Madison&#x27;s papers for the sum of $22,000 or $25,000.

In 1845, Dolley Madison was baptized into St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.

On February 28, 1844, Madison was with President John Tyler while aboard the USS &quot;Princeton&quot; when a &quot;Peacemaker&quot; cannon exploded in the process of being fired. While Secretaries of State and Navy Abel P. Upshur and Thomas Walker Gilmer, Tyler&#x27;s future father-in-law David Gardiner and three others were killed, Tyler and Madison escaped unharmed.

She was photographed on at least two occasions, making her the earliest First Lady to have a surviving photograph, with four daguerreotypes known to survive as of 2021. Three photographs were taken on July 4, 1848, including one featuring her niece, Anna Payne; the final one was taken in 1849, featuring President James Polk, his wife Sarah Polk, future President James Buchanan and future First Lady Harriet Lane.

Dolley Madison died at her home in Washington in 1849, at the age of 81. She was first buried in the Congressional Cemetery, Washington, D.C., but later was re-interred at Montpelier next to her husband. She was buried in an air-tight Fisk metallic burial case with a glass window plate for viewing the face of the deceased.

==Honors==

During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in her honor.

Madison was a member of the inaugural class of Virginia Women in History in 2000.

==Spelling of her name==

In the past, biographers and others stated that her given name was &quot;Dorothea,&quot; after her aunt, or &quot;Dorothy,&quot; and that &quot;Dolley&quot; was a nickname. But her birth was registered with the New Garden Friends Meeting under the name &quot;Dolley,&quot; and her will of 1841 states &quot;I, Dolly P. Madison&quot;. According to manuscript evidence and the scholarship of recent biographers, &quot;Dollie&quot; appears to have been her given name at birth. Printed publications of her day, however, especially newspapers, tended to spell it &quot;Dolly&quot;: for example, the &quot;Hallowell (Maine) Gazette&quot;, February 8, 1815, p. 4, notes that Congress had allowed &quot;Madame Dolly Madison&quot; an allowance of $14,000 to purchase new furniture; and the New Bedford (MA) of March 3, 1837, p. 2, citing important papers from her late husband, said that &quot;Mrs. Dolly Madison&quot; would be paid by the Senate for these historical manuscripts. Several magazines of that time also used the &quot;Dolly&quot; spelling, such as &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot;, February 1837, p. 165; as did many popular magazines of the 1860s–1890s. She was called &quot;Mistress Dolly&quot; in an essay in &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1896. Her grandniece Lucia Beverly Cutts, in her &quot;Memoirs and letters of Dolly Madison: wife of James Madison, president of the United States&quot; (1896), uses &quot;Dolly&quot; consistently throughout.

==Regard by historians==
Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Madison has ranked among the six-most highly regarded first ladies in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Madison has been ranked:
*4th-best of 42 in 1982
*4th-best of 37 in 1993
*3rd-best of 38 in 2003
*6th-best of 38 in 2008
*4th-best of 39 in 2014

In the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Madison was ranked in the top-four of all criteria, ranking the 4th-highest in value to the country and 5th-highest in public image. In the 2014 survey, Madison and her husband were ranked the 4th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<text>Deliverance is a 1972 American thriller film directed and produced by John Boorman from a screenplay by James Dickey, who adapted it from his own 1970 novel. It follows four businessmen from Atlanta who venture into the remote northern Georgia wilderness to see the Cahulawassee River before it is dammed, only to find themselves in danger from the area&#x27;s inhabitants and nature. It stars Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox, with the latter two making their feature film debuts.

&quot;Deliverance&quot; was a critical and commercial success. It earned three Academy Award nominations and five Golden Globe Award nominations, and grossed $46.1 million on a budget of $2 million. It became a popular culture landmark for a scene featuring Cox&#x27;s character playing &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; on guitar with a banjo-picking country boy, and garnered notoriety for a scene in which Beatty&#x27;s character is brutally raped by a mountain man. In 2008, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Lewis Medlock, Ed Gentry, Bobby Trippe, and Drew Ballinger are Atlanta businessmen who decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River in the remote northern Georgia wilderness before it is dammed. Lewis is an avid outdoorsman and survivalist who leads the group, and Ed has been on several trips but lacks Lewis&#x27;s ego, while Bobby and Drew are novices. En route to their launch site, the men, in particular Bobby, are rude toward the locals, who are hostile to the &quot;city boys&quot;. At a local gas station, Drew, with his guitar, engages a young banjo-playing boy in a musical duel. The duel is mutually enjoyable, and some of the locals break into dance at the sound of it. However, the boy does not acknowledge Drew when prompted for a friendly handshake.

The four friends travel in pairs and their two canoes become separated. Ed and Bobby encounter a pair of mountain men emerging from the woods, one carrying a shotgun and missing his two front teeth. Following an argument, Bobby is forced by the men to undress and the unarmed man rapes him, demanding he &quot;squeal like a pig&quot;, while Ed is tied to a tree and held at gunpoint. Lewis sneaks up and kills the rapist with his bow and arrow while Ed snatches the shotgun from the other mountain man, who flees into the woods. After a heated debate between Lewis and Drew, Ed and Bobby vote to side with Lewis&#x27; plan to bury the body and continue on as if nothing had happened. The four continue downriver but the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids in the lead canoe, Drew falls into the water.

The canoes collide on the rocks, throwing the three remaining men into the river and smashing one of the canoes. Lewis breaks his thigh bone and the other two are washed ashore alongside him in a gorge. Lewis, who believes Drew fell out of the boat because he was shot, encourages Ed to climb to the top of the gorge and ambush the other mountain man, whom they believe to be stalking them from above. Ed reaches an overhang and hides out until morning, when a man appears above him and aims a rifle at him; a panicked Ed clumsily shoots and manages to kill the man, but falls backwards and lands on one of his own arrows. Ed worries that he has killed the wrong man when he inspects the body to find that the man has all of his teeth, but he then realizes the man is wearing dentures. Ed and Bobby weigh down the man&#x27;s body in the river to ensure it will never be found, then do the same to Drew&#x27;s body when they encounter it downriver shortly after.

Upon finally reaching the small town of Aintry, Ed and Bobby take Lewis to the hospital. The three carefully concoct a cover story for local authorities about Drew&#x27;s death, lying about their adventure to Sheriff Bullard in order to escape a possible double murder charge. Their cover is almost blown when Ed thinks he has overheard Bobby secretly telling the sheriff the truth, but Bobby convinces him otherwise. Ed and Bobby visit Lewis in the hospital, where Lewis is being watched over by a police officer. A worried Ed whispers to Lewis that they need to change their cover story, but Lewis relaxes him by pretending that he has no memory of what happened after they fell off the canoes due to head trauma. Sheriff Bullard does not believe the men and reveals that Deputy Queen is suspicious of them because his brother-in-law went hunting a few days ago and has not returned. However, he has no evidence to arrest them, and instead tells them never to do &quot;this kind of thing again&quot; and to never come back to the area. The three men vow to keep their story of death and survival a secret for the rest of their lives.

Ed reunites with his wife and son. Some time after, a bloated hand rises from the lake, only to be revealed as a nightmare from the experience that torments Ed.

==Cast==

* Jon Voight as Ed Gentry
* Burt Reynolds as Lewis Medlock
* Ned Beatty as Bobby Trippe
* Ronny Cox as Drew Ballinger
* Bill McKinney as Mountain Man
* Herbert &quot;Cowboy&quot; Coward as Toothless Man
* James Dickey as Sheriff Bullard

Beatty&#x27;s wife Belinda and Boorman&#x27;s son Charley briefly appear as the wife and son of Voight&#x27;s character in the final scene.

==Production==
=== Casting ===
Casting was by Lynn Stalmaster. Dickey had initially wanted Sam Peckinpah to direct the film. Dickey also wanted Gene Hackman to portray Ed Gentry whereas Boorman wanted Lee Marvin to play the role. Boorman also wanted Marlon Brando to play Lewis Medlock. Jack Nicholson was considered for the role of Ed, while both Donald Sutherland and Charlton Heston turned down the role of Lewis. Other actors who were considered for the film included Robert Redford, Henry Fonda, George C. Scott and Warren Beatty.

===Filming===
&quot;Deliverance&quot; was shot primarily in Rabun County in northeastern Georgia. The canoe scenes were filmed in the Tallulah Gorge southeast of Clayton and on the Chattooga River. This river divides the northeastern corner of Georgia from the northwestern corner of South Carolina. Additional scenes were shot in Salem, South Carolina. Filming took place from May to August 1971.

A scene was also shot at the Mount Carmel Baptist Church cemetery. This site has since been flooded and lies under the surface of Lake Jocassee, on the border between Oconee and Pickens counties in South Carolina. The dam shown under construction is Jocassee Dam near Salem, South Carolina.

During the filming of the canoe scene, author James Dickey showed up inebriated and entered into a bitter argument with producer-director John Boorman, who had rewritten Dickey&#x27;s script. They allegedly had a brief fistfight in which Boorman, a much smaller man than Dickey, suffered a broken nose and four shattered teeth. Dickey was thrown off the set, but no charges were filed against him. The two reconciled and became good friends, and Boorman gave Dickey a cameo role as the sheriff at the end of the film.

The inspiration for the Cahulawassee River was the Coosawattee River, which was dammed in the 1970s and contained several dangerous whitewater rapids before being flooded by Carters Lake.

=== Stunts ===
The film is infamous for the cost cutting by the studio in an effort to kill it and having the actors perform their own stunts, such as Jon Voight notably climbing the cliff himself. Reynolds requested to have one scene re-shot with himself in a canoe rather than a dummy as it tumbled over a real waterfall. Reynolds recalled his shoulder and head hitting rocks and floating downstream with all of his clothes torn off, then waking up with director Boorman at his bedside. Reynolds asked &quot;How&#x27;d it look?&quot; and Boorman said, &quot;It looked like a dummy falling over a waterfall.&quot; Beatty almost drowned and Reynolds cracked his tailbone.

Regarding the courage of the four main actors in the movie performing their own stunts without insurance protection, Dickey was quoted as saying all of them &quot;had more guts than a burglar&quot;. In a nod to their stunt-performing audacity, early in the movie Lewis says, &quot;Insurance? I&#x27;ve never been insured in my life. I don&#x27;t believe in insurance. There&#x27;s no risk&quot;.

===&quot;Squeal like a pig&quot;===
Several people have been credited with the phrase &quot;squeal like a pig&quot;, the now-famous line spoken during the graphic rape scene. Ned Beatty said he thought of it while he and actor Bill McKinney (who played Beatty&#x27;s rapist) were improvising the scene. James Dickey&#x27;s son, Christopher Dickey, wrote in his memoir about the film production, &quot;Summer of Deliverance&quot;, that because Boorman had rewritten so much dialogue for the scene one of the crewmen suggested that Beatty&#x27;s character should just &quot;squeal like a pig&quot;. Boorman, in a DVD commentary he made for the film said the line was used because the studio wanted the male rape scene to be filmed in two ways: one for cinematic release and one that would be acceptable for television. As Boorman did not want to do that, he decided that the phrase &quot;squeal like a pig&quot;, suggested by Rabun County liaison Frank Rickman, was a good replacement for the original dialogue in the script. Reynolds later recalled the scene as so uncomfortable cameramen avoided watching, and Reynolds opted to interrupt the filming. Reynolds said, &quot;I asked John Boorman, the director, &#x27;Why did you let it go that long?&#x27; He said, &#x27;I wanted to take it as far as I could with the audience, and I figured you&#x27;d run in when it got too far.&#x27;&quot;

==Soundtrack and copyright dispute==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack brought new attention to the musical work &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot;, which had been recorded numerous times since 1955. Only Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandel were originally credited for the piece. The onscreen credits state that the song is an arrangement of the song &quot;Feudin&#x27; Banjos&quot;, showing Combine Music Corp as the copyright owner. Songwriter and producer Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith, who had written &quot;Feudin&#x27; Banjos&quot; in 1955, and recorded it with five-string banjo player Don Reno, filed a lawsuit for songwriting credit and a percentage of royalties. He was awarded both in a landmark copyright infringement case. Smith asked Warner Bros. to include his name on the official soundtrack listing, but reportedly asked to be omitted from the film credits because he found the film offensive.

Joe Boyd, who was producing the music for the movie &quot;Deliverance&quot;, offered &quot;Duelling Banjos&quot; to Bill Keith, but as Bill was travelling in Europe and wanted to visit a girl in Ireland, he turned it down suggesting Eric Weissberg instead.

No credit was given for the film score. The film has a number of sparse, brooding passages of music scattered throughout, including several played on a synthesizer. Some prints of the movie omit much of this extra music.

Boorman was given a gold record for the &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; hit single; this was later stolen from his house by the Dublin gangster Martin Cahill. Boorman recreated this scene in &quot;The General&quot; (1998), his biographical film about Cahill.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
&quot;Deliverance&quot; was a box office success in the United States, becoming the fifth-highest grossing film of 1972, with a domestic take of over $46 million. The film&#x27;s financial success continued the following year, when it went on to earn $18 million in North American &quot;distributor rentals&quot; (receipts).

===Critical===
&quot;Deliverance&quot; was well received by critics and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1972. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 89% rating based on reviews from 65 critics, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Given primal verve by John Boorman&#x27;s unflinching direction and Burt Reynolds&#x27; star-making performance, &quot;Deliverance&quot; is a terrifying adventure.&quot; 

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, &quot;It is a gripping horror story that at times may force you to look away from the screen, but it is so beautifully filmed that your eyes will eagerly return.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;an engrossing adventure, a demonstrable labor of love&quot; carried by Voight and Reynolds. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;certainly a distinctive and gripping piece of work, with a deliberately brooding, ominous tone and visual style that put you in a grave, fearful frame of mind, almost in spite of yourself.&quot;

Not all reviews were positive. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a mixed 2.5 stars out of a possible 4. He declared the film was &quot;admittedly effective on the level of simple adventure&quot; and had good performances, particularly from Voight and Reynolds. However, Ebert also wrote &quot;Deliverance&quot; &quot;totally fails [in] its attempt to make some kind of significant statement about its action [...] It&#x27;s possible to consider civilized men in a confrontation with the wilderness without throwing in rapes, cowboy-and-Indian stunts and pure exploitative sensationalism.&quot;

Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the setting was &quot;majestic&quot; but it was &quot;in the fleshing out that the script fumbles, and with it the direction and acting.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was also generally negative, calling the film &quot;a disappointment&quot; because &quot;so many of Dickey&#x27;s lumpy narrative ideas remain in his screenplay that John Boorman&#x27;s screen version becomes a lot less interesting than it has any right to be.&quot;

&quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance. The film was selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of &quot;The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;, while the viewers of Channel 4 in the United Kingdom voted it #45 on a list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Films&quot;. Reynolds later called it &quot;the best film I&#x27;ve ever been in&quot;. However, he stated that the rape scene went &quot;too far&quot;.

==Legacy==
Following the film&#x27;s release, Governor Jimmy Carter established a state film commission to encourage television and movie production in Georgia. The state has &quot;become one of the top five production destinations in the U.S&quot;. Tourism increased to Rabun County by the tens of thousands after the film&#x27;s release. By 2012, tourism was the largest source of revenue in the county, and rafting had developed as a $20 million industry in the region. Jon Voight&#x27;s stunt double for this film, Claude Terry, later purchased equipment used in the movie from Warner Brothers. He founded a whitewater rafting adventure company on the Chattooga River, Southeastern Expeditions. Payson Kennedy, the stunt double for Ned Beatty, established the Nantahala Outdoor Center with his wife and Horace Holden along the Nantahala River in Swain County, North Carolina, in 1972, the same year that &quot;Deliverance&quot; was released.

<text>In organology, the study of musical instruments, many methods of classifying instruments exist. Most methods are specific to a particular cultural group and were developed to serve that culture&#x27;s musical needs. Culture-based classification methods sometimes break down when applied outside that culture. For example, a classification based on instrument use may fail when applied to another culture that uses the same instrument differently.

In the study of Western music, the most common classification method divides instruments into the following groups: 
* String instruments (often subdivided between plucked and bowed instruments);
* Wind instruments (often subdivided between woodwinds and brass);
* Percussion instruments; and 
* Electronic instruments

==Classification criteria==

The criteria for classifying musical instruments vary depending on the point of view, time, and place. The many various approaches examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (shape, construction, material composition, physical state, etc.), the manner in which the instrument is played (plucked, bowed, etc.), the means by which the instrument produces sound, the quality or timbre of the sound produced by the instrument, the tonal and dynamic range of the instrument, the musical function of the instrument (rhythmic, melodic, etc.), and the instrument&#x27;s place in an orchestra or other ensemble.

==Classification systems by their geographical and historical origins==

===European and Western===

2nd-century Greek grammarian, sophist, and rhetorician Julius Pollux, in the chapter called De Musica of his ten-volume &quot;Onomastikon&quot;, presented the two-class system, percussion (including strings) and winds, which persisted in medieval and postmedieval Europe. It was used by St. Augustine (4th and 5th centuries), in his De Ordine, applying the terms rhythmic (percussion and strings), organic (winds), and adding harmonic (the human voice); Isidore of Seville (6th to 7th centuries); Hugh of Saint Victor (12th century), also adding the voice; Magister Lambertus (13th century), adding the human voice as well; and Michael Praetorius (17th century).

The modern system divides instruments into wind, strings and percussion. It is of Greek origin (in the Hellenistic period, prominent proponents being Nicomachus and Porphyry). The scheme was later expanded by Martin Agricola, who distinguished plucked string instruments, such as guitars, from bowed string instruments, such as violins. Classical musicians today do not always maintain this division (although plucked strings are grouped separately from bowed strings in sheet music), but distinguish between wind instruments with a reed (woodwinds) and those where the air is set in motion directly by the lips (brass instruments).

Many instruments do not fit very neatly into this scheme. The serpent, for example, ought to be classified as a brass instrument, as a column of air is set in motion by the lips. However, it looks more like a woodwind instrument, and is closer to one in many ways, having finger-holes to control pitch, rather than valves.l.

Keyboard instruments do not fit easily into this scheme. For example, the piano has strings, but they are struck by hammers, so it is not clear whether it should be classified as a string instrument or a percussion instrument. For this reason, keyboard instruments are often regarded as inhabiting a category of their own, including all instruments played by a keyboard, whether they have struck strings (like the piano), plucked strings (like the harpsichord) or no strings at all (like the celesta).

It might be said that with these extra categories, the classical system of instrument classification focuses less on the fundamental way in which instruments produce sound, and more on the technique required to play them.

Various names have been assigned to these three traditional Western groupings:
* Boethius (5th and 6th centuries) labelled them &quot;intensione ut nervis, spiritu ut tibiis (&quot;breath in the tube&quot;), and percussione&quot;;
* Cassiodorus, a younger contemporary of Boethius, used the names &quot;tensibilia, percussionalia&quot;, and &quot;inflatilia&quot;;
* Roger Bacon (13th century) dubbed them &quot;tensilia, inflativa&quot;, and &quot;percussionalia&quot;;
* Ugolino da Orvieto (14th and 15th centuries) called them &quot;intensione ut nervis, spiritu ut tibiis&quot;, and &quot;percussione&quot;;
* Sebastien de Brossard (1703) referred to them as &quot;enchorda&quot; or &quot;entata&quot; (but only for instruments with several strings), &quot;pneumatica&quot; or &quot;empneousta&quot;, and &quot;krusta&quot; (from the Greek for hit or strike) or &quot;pulsatilia&quot; (for percussives);
* Filippo Bonanni (1722) used vernacular names: &quot;sonori per il fiato&quot;, &quot;sonori per la tensione&quot;, and &quot;sonori per la percussione&quot;;
* Joseph Majer (1732) called them &quot;pneumatica&quot;, &quot;pulsatilia&quot; (percussives including plucked instruments), and &quot;fidicina&quot; (from fidula, fiddle) (for bowed instruments);
* Johann Eisel (1738) dubbed them &quot;pneumatica, pulsatilia&quot;, and &quot;fidicina&quot;;
* Johannes de Muris (1784) used the terms &quot;chordalia&quot;, &quot;foraminalia&quot; (from &quot;foramina&quot;, &quot;bore&quot; in reference to the bored tubes), and &quot;vasalia&quot; (for &quot;vessels&quot;);
* Regino of Prum (1784) called them &quot;tensibile&quot;, &quot;inflatile&quot;, and &quot;percussionabile&quot;.

====Mahillon and Hornbostel–Sachs systems====
Victor-Charles Mahillon, curator of the musical instrument collection of the conservatoire in Brussels, for the 1888 catalogue of the collection divided instruments into four groups and assigned Greek-derived labels to the four classifications: chordophones (stringed instruments), membranophones (skin-head percussion instruments), aerophones (wind instruments), and autophones (non-skin percussion instruments). This scheme was later taken up by Erich von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs who published an extensive new scheme for classification in &quot;Zeitschrift für Ethnologie&quot; in 1914. Their scheme is widely used today, and is most often known as the Hornbostel–Sachs system (or the Sachs–Hornbostel system).

The original Sachs–Hornbostel system classified instruments into four main groups:
# idiophones, such as the xylophone, which produce sound by vibrating themselves;
# membranophones, such as drums or kazoos, which produce sound by a vibrating membrane;
# chordophones, such as the piano or cello, which produce sound by vibrating strings;
# aerophones, such as the pipe organ or oboe, which produce sound by vibrating columns of air.

Later Sachs added a fifth category, electrophones, such as theremins, which produce sound by electronic means. Modern synthesizers and electronic instruments fall in this category. Within each category are many subgroups. The system has been criticized and revised over the years, but remains widely used by ethnomusicologists and organologists. One notable example of this criticism is that care should be taken with electrophones, as some electronic instruments like the electric guitar (chordophone) and some electronic keyboards (sometimes idiophones or chordophones) can produce music without electricity or the use of an amplifier.

In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification of musical instruments, lamellophones are considered plucked idiophones, a category that includes various forms of jaw harp and the European mechanical music box, as well as the huge variety of African and Afro-Latin thumb pianos such as the mbira and marimbula.

====André Schaeffner====

In 1932, comparative musicologist (ethnomusicologist) André Schaeffner developed a new classification scheme that was &quot;exhaustive, potentially covering all real and conceivable instruments&quot;.

Schaeffner&#x27;s system has only two top-level categories which he denoted by Roman numerals:
* I: instruments that make sound from vibrating solids:
** I.A: no tension (free solid, for example, xylophones, cymbals, or claves);
** I.B: linguaphones (lamellophones) (solid fixed at only one end, such as a kalimba or thumb piano);
** I.C: chordophones (solid fixed at both ends, i.e. strings such as piano or harp); plus drums
* II: instruments that make sound from vibrating air (such as clarinets, trumpets, or bull-roarers.)

The system agrees with Mahillon and Hornbostel–Sachs for chordophones, but groups percussion instruments differently.

The MSA (Multi-Dimensional Scalogram Analysis) of René Lysloff and Jim Matson, using 37 variables, including characteristics of the sounding body, resonator, substructure, sympathetic vibrator, performance context, social context, and instrument tuning and construction, corroborated Schaeffner, producing two categories, aerophones and the chordophone-membranophone-idiophone combination.

André Schaeffner has been president of the French association of musicologists Société française de musicologie (1958–1967).

====Kurt Reinhard====
In 1960, German musicologist Kurt Reinhard presented a stylistic taxonomy, as opposed to a morphological one, with two divisions determined by either single or multiple voices playing. Each of these two divisions was subdivided according to pitch changeability (not changeable, freely changeable, and changeable by fixed intervals), and also by tonal continuity (discontinuous (as the marimba and drums) and continuous (the friction instruments (including bowed) and the winds), making 12 categories. He also proposed classification according to whether they had dynamic tonal variability, a characteristic that separates whole eras (e.g., the baroque from the classical) as in the transition from the terraced dynamics of the harpsichord to the crescendo of the piano, grading by degree of absolute loudness, timbral spectra, tunability, and degree of resonance.

====Steve Mann====
In 2007, Steve Mann presented a five-class, physics-based organology elaborating on the classification proposed by Schaeffner. This system is composed of gaiaphones (chordophones, membranophones, and idiophones), hydraulophones, aerophones, plasmaphones, and quintephones (electrically and optically produced music), the names referring to the five essences, earth, water, wind, fire and the quintessence, thus adding three new categories to the Schaeffner taxonomy.
Elementary organology, also known as physical organology, is a classification scheme based on the elements (i.e. states of matter) in which sound production takes place. &quot;Elementary&quot; refers both to &quot;element&quot; (state of matter) and to something that is fundamental or innate (physical). The elementary organology map can be traced to Kartomi, Schaeffner, Yamaguchi, and others, as well as to the Greek and Roman concepts of elementary classification of all objects, not just musical instruments.

Elementary organology categorizes musical instruments by their classical element:

===Other Western classifications===

====Classification by tonal range====

Instruments can be classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family. These terms are named after singing voice classifications:
* Higher-than-sopranino instruments: the garklein recorder in C (also known as the sopranissimo recorder, or piccolo recorder), soprillo saxophone, piccolo
* Sopranino instruments:  sopranino recorder, sopranino saxophone, treble flute
* Soprano instruments: concert flute, soprano clarinet, basset clarinet, soprano recorder, violin, trumpet, oboe, soprano saxophone, soprano sarrusophone
* Alto instruments: alto flute, alto recorder, viola, French horn, natural horn, alto horn, alto clarinet, alto saxophone, alto sarrusophone, English horn
* Tenor instruments: trombone, euphonium, tenor violin, tenor flute, basset horn, tenor saxophone, tenor sarrusophone, tenoroon, tenor recorder, bass flute, tenor drum, harpsichord (at 8&#x27; pitch), guitar
* Baritone instruments: cello, baritone horn, bass clarinet, bassoon, baritone saxophone, baritone sarrusophone
* Bass instruments: bass recorder, bass oboe, bass tuba, bass saxophone, bass sarrusophone, bass trombone, bass guitar, bass drum
* Lower-than-bass instruments: contrabass tuba, double bass, contrabassoon, contrabass clarinet, contrabass saxophone, contrabass sarrusophone, subcontrabass saxophone, tubax, octobass
Some instruments fall into more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered either tenor or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, tenor, or bass and the French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on which range it is played. In a typical concert band setting, the first alto saxophone covers soprano parts, while the second alto saxophone covers alto parts.

Many instruments include their range as part of their name: soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, baritone horn, alto flute, bass flute, bass guitar, etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino recorder, sopranino saxophone, contrabass recorder, contrabass clarinet.

When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument&#x27;s range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute&#x27;s range is from C3 to F6, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.

====Classification by function====
Instruments can be categorized according to typical use, such as signal instruments, a category that may include instruments in different Hornbostel–Sachs categories such as trumpets, drums, and gongs. An example based on this criterion is Bonanni (e.g., festive, military, and religious). He separately classified them according to geography and era.

Instruments can be classified according to the role they play in the ensemble. For example, the horn section in popular music typically includes both brass instruments and woodwind instruments. The symphony orchestra typically has the strings in the front, the woodwinds in the middle, and the basses, brass, and percussion in the back.

====Classification by geographical or ethnic origin====

Jean-Benjamin de la Borde (1780) classified instruments according to ethnicity, his categories being Black, Abyssinian, Chinese, Arabic, Turkish, and Greek.

===West and South Asian===

====Indian====

An ancient system of Indian origin, dating from the 4th or 3rd century BC, in the Natya Shastra, a theoretical treatise on music and dramaturgy, by Bharata Muni, divides instruments (&quot;vadya&quot;) into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings (&quot;tata vadya&quot;, &quot;stretched instruments&quot;); instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air (&quot;susira vadya&quot;, &quot;hollow instruments&quot;); percussion instruments made of wood or metal (&quot;Ghana vadya&quot;, &quot;solid instruments&quot;); and percussion instruments with skin heads, or drums (&quot;avanaddha vadya&quot;, &quot;covered instruments&quot;).

====Persian====

Al-Farabi, Persian scholar of the 10th century, distinguished tonal duration. In one of his four schemes, in his two-volume &quot;Kitab al-Musiki al-Kabir&quot; (&quot;Great Book of Music&quot;) he identified five classes, in order of ranking, as follows: the human voice, the bowed strings (the &quot;rebab&quot;) and winds, plucked strings, percussion, and dance, the first three pointed out as having continuous tone.

Ibn Sina, Persian scholar of the 11th century, presented a scheme in his &quot;Kitab al-Najat&quot; (Book of the Delivery), made the same distinction. He used two classes. In his &quot;Kitab al-Shifa&quot; (Book of Soul Healing), he proposed another taxonomy, of five classes: fretted instruments; unfretted (open) stringed, lyres and harps; bowed stringed; wind (reeds and some other woodwinds, such as the flute and bagpipe), other wind instruments such as the organ; and the stick-struck santur (a board zither). The distinction between fretted and open was in classic Persian fashion.

====Turkish====
Ottoman encyclopedist Hadji Khalifa (17th century) recognized three classes of musical instruments in his &quot;Kashf al-Zunun an Asami al-Kutub wa al-Funun&quot; (&quot;Clarification and Conjecture About the Names of Books and Sciences&quot;), a treatise on the origin and construction of instruments. This was exceptional for a Near Eastern writer, most of whom, like Near Eastern culture traditionally and early Hellenistic Greeks, ignored the percussion instruments because it regarded them as primitive.

===East and South-East Asian===

====Chinese====

The oldest known scheme of classifying instruments is Chinese and may date as far back as the second millennium BC. It grouped instruments according to the materials they are made of. Instruments made of stone were in one group, those of wood in another, those of silk are in a third, and those of bamboo in a fourth, as recorded in the &quot;Yo Chi&quot; (record of ritual music and dance), compiled from sources of the Chou period (9th–5th centuries BC) and corresponding to the four seasons and four winds.

The eight-fold system of eight sounds or timbres (八音, bā yīn), from the same source, occurred gradually, and in the legendary Emperor Shun&#x27;s time (3rd millennium BC) it is believed to have been presented in the following order: metal (金, jīn), stone (石, shí), silk (絲, sī), bamboo (竹, zhú), gourd (匏, páo), clay (土, tǔ), leather (革, gé), and wood (木, mù) classes, and it correlated to the eight seasons and eight winds of Chinese culture, autumn and west, autumn-winter and NW, summer and south, spring and east, winter-spring and NE, summer-autumn and SW, winter and north, and spring-summer and SE, respectively.

However, the Chou-Li (Rites of Chou), an anonymous treatise compiled from earlier sources in about the 2nd century BC, had the following order: metal, stone, clay, leather, silk, wood, gourd, and bamboo. The same order was presented in the Tso Chuan (Commentary of Tso), attributed to Tso Chiu-Ming, probably compiled in the 4th century BC.

Much later, Ming dynasty (14th–17th century) scholar Chu Tsai Yu recognized three groups: those instruments using muscle power or used for musical accompaniment, those that are blown, and those that are rhythmic, a scheme which was probably the first scholarly attempt, while the earlier ones were traditional, folk taxonomies.

More usually, instruments are classified according to how the sound is initially produced (regardless of post-processing, i.e., an electric guitar is still a string-instrument regardless of what analog or digital/computational post-processing effects pedals may be used with it).

====Indonesian====
Classifications done for the Indonesian ensemble, the gamelan, were done by Jaap Kunst (1949), Martopangrawit, Poerbapangrawit, and Sumarsam (all in 1984). Kunst described five categories: nuclear theme (&quot;cantus firmus&quot; in Latin and &quot;balungan&quot; (&quot;skeletal framework&quot;) in Indonesian); colotomic (a word invented by Kunst, meaning &quot;interpunctuating&quot;), the gongs; countermelodic; paraphrasing (&quot;panerusan&quot;), subdivided as close to the nuclear theme and ornamental filling; agogic (tempo-regulating), drums.

R. Ng. Martopangrawit has two categories, irama (the rhythm instruments) and lagu (the melodic instruments), the former corresponds to Kunst&#x27;s classes 2 and 5, and the latter to Kunst&#x27;s 1, 3, and 4.

Kodrat Poerbapangrawit, similar to Kunst, derives six categories: &quot;balungan&quot;, the &quot;saron&quot;, &quot;demung&quot;, and &quot;slenthem&quot;; &quot;rerenggan&quot; (ornamental), the &quot;gendèr&quot;, &quot;gambang&quot;, and &quot;bonang&quot;); &quot;wiletan&quot; (variable formulaic melodic), &quot;rebab&quot; and male chorus (&quot;gerong&quot;); &quot;singgetan&quot; (interpunctuating); &quot;kembang&quot; (floral), flute and female voice; jejeging wirama (tempo regulating), drums.

Sumarsam&#x27;s scheme comprises
* an inner melodic group (&quot;lagu&quot;)(with a wide range), divided as
** elaborating (&quot;rebab, gerong, gendèr&quot; (a metallophone), &quot;gambang&quot; (a xylophone), &quot;pesindhen&quot; (female voice), &quot;celempung&quot; (plucked strings), &quot;suling&quot; (flute));
** mediating ( between the 1st and 3rd subdivisions (bonang (gong-chimes), saron panerus(a loud metallophone); and
** abstracting (&quot;balungan&quot;, &quot;melodic abstraction&quot;)( with a 1-octave range), loud and soft metallophones (&quot;saron barung, demung&quot;, and &quot;slenthem&quot;);
* an outer circle, the structural group (gongs), which underlines the structure of the work;
* and occupying the space outside the outer circle, the &quot;kendang&quot;, a tempo-regulating group (drums).

The gamelan is also divided into front, middle, and back, much like the symphony orchestra.

An orally transmitted Javanese taxonomy has 8 groupings:
* ricikan dijagur (&quot;instruments beaten with a padded hammer,&quot; e.g., suspended gongs);
* ricikan dithuthuk (&quot;instruments knocked with a hard or semihard hammer,&quot; e.g., saron (similar to the glockenspiel) and gong-chimes);
* ricikan dikebuk (&quot;hand-beaten instruments&quot;, e.g., kendhang (drum));
* ricikan dipethik (&quot;plucked instruments&quot;);
* ricikan disendal (&quot;pulled instruments,&quot; e.g., genggong (jaw harp with string mechanism));
* ricikan dikosok (&quot;bowed instruments&quot;);
* ricikan disebul (&quot;blown instruments&quot;);
* ricikan dikocok (&quot;shaken instruments&quot;).

A Javanese classification transmitted in literary form is as follows:
* ricikan prunggu/wesi (&quot;instruments made of bronze or iron&quot;);
* ricikan kulit (&quot;leather instruments&quot;, drums);
* ricikan kayu (&quot;wooden instruments&quot;);
* ricikan kawat/tali (&quot;string instruments&quot;);
* ricikan bambu pring (&quot;bamboo instruments&quot;, e.g., flutes).

This is much like the pa yin. It is suspected of being old but its age is unknown.

Minangkabau musicians (of West Sumatra) use the following taxonomy for &quot;bunyi-bunyian&quot; (&quot;objects that sound&quot;): &quot;dipukua&quot; (&quot;beaten&quot;), &quot;dipupuik&quot; (&quot;blown), &quot;dipatiek&quot; (&quot;plucked&quot;), &quot;ditariek&quot; (&quot;pulled&quot;), &quot;digesek&quot; (&quot;bowed&quot;), &quot;dipusiang&quot; (&quot;swung&quot;). The last one is for the bull-roarer. They also distinguish instruments on the basis of origin because of sociohistorical contacts, and recognize three categories: Mindangkabau (&quot;Minangkabau asli&quot;), Arabic (&quot;asal Arab&quot;), and Western (&quot;asal Barat&quot;), each of these divided up according to the five categories. Classifying musical instruments on the basis sociohistorical factors as well as mode of sound production is common in Indonesia.

The Batak of North Sumatra recognize the following classes: beaten (&quot;alat pukul&quot; or &quot;alat palu&quot;), blown (&quot;alat tiup&quot;), bowed (&quot;alat gesek&quot;), and plucked (&quot;alat petik&quot;) instruments, but their primary classification is of ensembles.

====Philippines====
The T&#x27;boli of Mindanao use three categories, grouping the strings (&quot;t&#x27;duk&quot;) with the winds (&quot;nawa&quot;) together based on a gentleness-strength dichotomy (&quot;lemnoy&quot;-&quot;megel&quot;, respectively), regarding the percussion group (&quot;tembol&quot;) as strong and the winds-strings group as gentle. The division pervades T&#x27;boli thought about cosmology, social characters of men and women, and artistic styles.

===African===

====West African====
In West Africa, tribes such as the Dan, Gio, Kpelle, Hausa, Akan, and Dogon, use a human-centered system. It derives from 4 myth-based parameters: the musical instrument&#x27;s nonhuman owner (spirit, mask, sorcerer, or animal), the mode of transmission to the human realm (by gift, exchange, contract, or removal), the making of the instrument by a human (according to instructions from a nonhuman, for instance), and the first human owner. Most instruments are said to have a nonhuman origin, but some are believed invented by humans, e.g., the xylophone and the lamellophone.

The Kpelle of West Africa distinguish the struck (&quot;yàle&quot;), including both beaten and plucked, and the blown (&quot;fêe&quot;). The &quot;yàle&quot; group is subdivided into five categories: instruments possessing lamellas (the sanzas); those possessing strings; those possessing a membrane (various drums); hollow wooden, iron, or bottle containers; and various rattles and bells. The Hausa, also of West Africa, classify drummers into those who beat drums and those who beat (pluck) strings (the other four player classes are blowers, singers, acclaimers, and talkers),

<doc id="101901" wikidata="Q181890" url="?curid=101901" title="Plectrum">
<text>A plectrum is a small flat tool used for plucking or strumming of a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a [[guitar pick|pick]] and is held as a separate tool in the player&#x27;s hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism.

==Plectra wielded by hand==

===Guitars and similar instruments ===

A plectrum for electric guitars, acoustic guitars, bass guitars and mandolins is typically a thin piece of plastic or other material most commonly shaped like a pointed teardrop or triangle, though the size, gauge, shape and width may vary considerably. Banjo and guitar players may wear a metal or plastic thumb pick mounted on a ring, and bluegrass banjo players often wear metal or plastic fingerpicks on their fingertips. Many guitarists use fingerpicks as well.

Guitar picks are made of a variety of materials, including celluloid, metal, and rarely other exotic materials such as turtle shell, but today delrin (a synthetic thermoplastic polymer) is the most common. For other instruments in the modern day, most players use plastic plectra but a variety of other materials, including wood and felt (for use with the ukulele) are common. Guitarists in the rock, blues, jazz and bluegrass genres tend to use a plectrum, partly due to the use of steel strings wearing out the player&#x27;s fingernails quickly, but also because a plectrum provides a more &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;focused&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; sound. Many guitarists will also use the pick in combination with the remaining picking-hand fingers simultaneously, to combine the different advantages of flat-picking and finger picking. This technique is called &quot;hybrid picking&quot;, or more colloquially in country &amp; bluegrass genres, as chicken pickin&#x27;.

A plectrum of the guitar type is often called a pick (or a &quot;flatpick&quot; to distinguish it from fingerpicks).

===Non-Western instruments===
The plectra for the Japanese biwa and shamisen can be quite large, and those used for the Arabic oud are longer and narrower, replacing the formerly used eagle feather. Plectra used for Chinese instruments such as the sanxian were formerly made of animal horn, though many players today use plastic plectra.

===Plectra from around the world===
==Plectra in harpsichords==

In a harpsichord, there is a separate plectrum for each string. These plectra are very small, often only about 10 millimeters long, about 1.5 millimeters wide, and half a millimeter thick. The plectrum is gently tapered, being narrowest at the plucking end. The top surface of the plectrum is flat and horizontal and is held in the tongue of the jack; the tongue is pivoted so that the plectrum plucks the string when moving up, but is pushed away when moving down.

In the historical period of harpsichord construction (up to about 1800) plectra were made of sturdy feather quills, usually from crows or ravens. In Italy, some makers (including Bartolomeo Cristofori) used vulture quills. Other Italian harpsichords employed plectra of leather. In late French harpsichords by the great builder Pascal Taskin, &quot;peau de buffle&quot;, a chamois-like material from the hide of the European bison, was used for plectra to produce a delicate pianissimo.

Modern harpsichords frequently employ plectra made with plastic, specifically the plastic known as acetal. Some plectra are of the homopolymer variety of acetal, sold by DuPont under the name &quot;Delrin&quot;, while others are of the copolymer variety, sold by Ticona as &quot;Celcon&quot;. Harpsichord technicians and builders generally use the trade names to refer to these materials. In either of its varieties, acetal is far more durable than quill, which cuts down substantially on the time that must be spent in voicing (see below).

Several contemporary builders and players have reasserted the superiority of bird quill for high-level harpsichords. While the difference in sound between acetal and quill is acknowledged to be small, what difference may exist is held to be to the advantage of quill. In addition, quill plectra tend to fail gradually, giving warning by the diminishing volume, whereas acetal plectra fail suddenly and completely, sometimes in the middle of a performance.

===Voicing harpsichord plectra===
The plectra of a harpsichord must be cut precisely, in a process called &quot;voicing&quot;. A properly voiced plectrum will pluck the string in a way that produces a good musical tone and matches well in loudness with all of the other strings. The underside of the plectrum must be appropriately slanted and entirely smooth, so that the jack will not &quot;hang&quot; (get caught on the string) when, after sounding a note, it is moved back down below the level of the string.

Normally, voicing is carried out by inserting the plectrum into the jack, then placing the jack on a small wooden voicing block, so that the top of the plectrum sits flush with the block. The plectrum is then cut and thinned on the underside with a small, very sharp knife, such as an X-Acto knife. As the plectrum is progressively trimmed, its jack is replaced in the instrument at intervals to test the result for loudness, tone quality, and the possibility of hanging.

Voicing is a refined skill, carried out fluently by professional builders, but one that usually must also be learned (at least to some degree) by harpsichord owners.

== Etymology and usage ==

First attested in English 15th century, the word &quot;plectrum&quot; comes from Latin &quot;plectrum&quot;, itself derived from Greek πλῆκτρον (&quot;plēktron&quot;), &quot;anything to strike with, an instrument for striking the lyre, a spear point&quot;.

&quot;Plectrum&quot; has both a Latin-based plural, &quot;plectra&quot; and a native English plural, &quot;plectrums&quot;. &quot;Plectra&quot; is used in formal writing, particularly in discussing the harpsichord as an instrument of classical music, while &quot;plectrums&quot; is more common in ordinary speech.

<text>Dolly Madison is an American bakery brand owned by Hostess Brands, selling packaged baked snack foods. It is best known for its long marketing association with the &quot;Peanuts&quot; animated TV specials.

==History==

In 1937, Ralph Leroy Nafziger started a snack cake brand in Georgia called Dolly Madison. The name was inspired by first lady Dolley Madison, who was known for her elegant parties, but with a different spelling of her first name. The brand&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Cakes and pastries fine enough to serve at the White House.&quot; A Dolly Madison Bakery appears in the 1932 movie &quot;Officer 13&quot; and was named after Dolley Madison, the wife of President James Madison. The name was also used for a successful ice cream brand sold for decades in the United States in the mid-twentieth century, with a logo featuring a silhouette of Dolly Madison. 

The snack cake brand was among the products liquidated by Hostess when it announced plans to cease business on November 16, 2012. When Apollo Global Management acquired Hostess Brands&#x27; Twinkies in January 2013, they also acquired the rights to the Dolly Madison snack cake brands, as well as the official corporate name to Dolly Madison and Hostess Brands, with plans to resume production of the products.

==Marketing==
In marketing, Dolly Madison snacks are probably best remembered for their long association with characters from Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip. Charlie Brown and his friends appeared on Dolly Madison packages and in television commercials in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The bakery, along with Coca-Cola and McDonald&#x27;s, was a major sponsor of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; animated specials telecast on CBS during that period. Each pie flavor was sold with a different character on the wrapper, including:
::Charlie Brown – cherry and banana crème
::Linus van Pelt – apple
::Lucy van Pelt – lemon
::Schroeder – berry
::Sally Brown – coconut crème and pineapple
::Frieda – chocolate
::Peppermint Patty – strawberry and peach
::Marcie – Boysenberry

The wrappers were later redesigned and featured Snoopy on all the flavors. Charlie Brown was also on Zingers packages wearing a baseball cap. Snoopy and Linus were also on Gems donut packages as well.

During the period when the packages featured Peanuts characters, the advertising agency for Dolly Madison products was Dancer Fitzgerald Sample&#x27;s San Francisco branch—primarily due to its proximity to Schulz (based in nearby Santa Rosa).

<doc id="101904" wikidata="Q7564851" url="?curid=101904" title="Sounder (novel)">
<text>Sounder is a young adult novel by William H. Armstrong, published in 1969. It is the story of an African-American boy living with his sharecropper family. Although the family&#x27;s difficulties increase when the father is imprisoned for stealing a ham from work, the boy still hungers for an education.

Sounder, the dog&#x27;s name, is the only character name used in the book. The author refers to the various characters by their relationship or their role in the story. The setting is also ambiguous. The author notes prisoners were hauled in &quot;mule-drawn wagons&quot;, and the mention of chain gangs places an upper limit to the story of 1955 when the practice ended. The boy hears his father may be in Bartow and later Gilmer counties, but the author does not specify where the boy lives.

&quot;Sounder&quot; won the Newbery Award in 1970 and was made into a major motion picture in 1972.

==Plot summary==
The black sharecropper&#x27;s family is poor and hungry. The father and his dog, Sounder, go hunting each night, but the hunting is inadequate. The family subsists on fried corn mush, biscuits, and milk gravy until one morning they wake up to the smell of boiling ham. They feast for three days, but finally the sheriff and two of his deputies burst into the cabin and arrest the father for stealing the ham. Sounder chases after them, and one of the deputies shoots him with a shotgun.

The arrested man&#x27;s son goes looking for Sounder but cannot find him. Returning to the scene of the shooting, the boy finds a part of Sounder&#x27;s ear. While his mother cautions him not to &quot;be all hope&quot;, the boy searches for the dog every day for weeks. In the father&#x27;s absence, the family survives on the money the mother makes by selling cracked walnuts. The boy helps to look after his three younger siblings and experiences the intense loneliness of the cabin.

For Christmas, the boy&#x27;s mother makes a four-layer cake for him to take to his father in jail. When he arrives, the guard treats him rudely. Finally the boy is admitted, and the guard breaks the cake into pieces, saying he suspects it could hide something which could help the boy&#x27;s father escape. The boy gives the mangled cake to his father anyway and tells him that Sounder might not be dead. Their conversation is strained and difficult. The father tells the boy not to come back to the jail, and he goes home.

About two months after the father&#x27;s arrest, the boy awakes to the sound of faint whining, goes outside, and finds Sounder standing there. The dog can only use three legs, has only one ear and one eye, and no longer barks. The boy and his mother welcome the dog home.

Once the family learns that the father was convicted and sentenced to hard labor, the boy resolves to search for his father. During the late fall and winter months over a period of several years, he journeys within and among counties, looking for working convicts, seeking word of his father. He also tries with some success to teach himself to read signs and newspapers.

One day he is leaning against a fence, watching a group of convicts at a road camp, trying to make out his father&#x27;s form, when a guard whacks the boy on the fingers with a piece of iron and tells him to leave. While the boy walks toward the outskirts of town, he sees someone putting a book in a trash can. It is a large volume of Montaigne, and the boy takes it with him. He finds a school where he tries to wash the blood off his hands. While he is at the pump, the boy meets an old teacher who dresses his wounds and asks what happened to him. The boy tells the teacher about Sounder and his father and, observing the book, the teacher extends an offer to the boy to live with him and learn to read. The boy&#x27;s mother tells him to go, and he stays with the teacher during the winter, working in the fields in summer.

One August day, the boy is at home helping with chores when they see his father walking toward them. One side of his father&#x27;s body is crippled from being crushed in a quarry. Sounder, who has anticipated the man&#x27;s return for days, runs out to meet him and barks.

Weeks later, the man and his dog go hunting for the first time since the man&#x27;s return. The man has been waiting until he can invite his son, but now he sees that the boy is tired from fieldwork, and the man further senses that the activity might no longer interest the boy. At dawn, Sounder comes back without his master and, when the boy follows Sounder to the man, he finds him dead. Before leaving to return to school, the boy tells his mother that Sounder will be dead before he can come back for the holiday. Two weeks before Christmas, Sounder crawls under the porch and dies. Despite their deaths, there is a sense of peace and resolution over the family - especially for the boy, who has achieved the thing he most wanted - to learn to read.

==Film==

In 1972, &quot;Sounder&quot; was made into a film starring Cicely Tyson, Paul Winfield, Kevin Hooks, Carmen Mathews, Taj Mahal, and Eric Hooks. It was written by Lonne Elder III and directed by Martin Ritt.

In 2003, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; aired a new film adaptation, reuniting two actors from the original. Kevin Hooks directed and Paul Winfield played the role of the teacher. Winfield and Hooks played father and son, respectively, in the original version.

<doc id="101905" wikidata="Q194492" url="?curid=101905" title="Gamelan">
<text>Gamelan (; ; , ; ) is the traditional ensemble music of the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese peoples of Indonesia, made up predominantly of percussive instruments. The most common instruments used are metallophones (played with mallets) and a set of hand-drums called &quot;kendang&quot;, which keep the beat. The &quot;kemanak&quot;, a banana-shaped idiophone, and the &quot;gangsa&quot;, another metallophone, are also commonly used gamelan instruments on Bali. Other notable instruments include xylophones, bamboo flutes (similar to the Indian &quot;bansuri&quot;), a bowed string instrument called a &quot;rebab&quot; (somewhat similar to the &quot;gadulka&quot; of Bulgaria), and a zither-like instrument called a &quot;siter&quot;, used in Javanese gamelan. Additionally, vocalists may be featured, being referred to as &quot;sindhen&quot; for females or &quot;gerong&quot; for males.

Although the popularity of gamelan has declined slightly since the introduction of modern popular music to Indonesia, the art form is still widely respected, being commonly played in many traditional ceremonies. It may also be performed as entertainment for some modern events, such as official cultural, corporate, government or educational functions, both formal or informal. Gamelan is also, traditionally, arranged and performed to accompany religious rituals, ceremonies, dance theatre, dance-drama, traditional Indonesian theater, wayang puppets theatre, singing, concerts, festivals, exhibitions, and many more. Many consider gamelan to be an integral part of Indonesian culture.

In 2014, Gamelan traditions were recognized as part of the National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture.

On 15 December 2021, Gamelan was inscribed onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The nomination builds on the archaeological connection to the Borobudur, and includes a focus on its role in fostering a sense of national identity and pride, in addition to wellbeing aspects such as mental health, the development of interpersonal skills and the connection between its cosmology and an ethics of mutual respect and care. The listing consists of Javanese gamelan (gamelan jawa) of Central Java and Special Region of Yogyakarta, Balinese gamelan (gamelan bali) of Bali, Sundanese gamelan (gamelan sunda) of West Java, Madurese gamelan (gamelan madura) and Banyuwangian Gamelan (gamelan banyuwangi) of East Java, Gendang beleq of West Nusa Tenggara, Banjarese gamelan (gamelan banjar) of South Kalimantan, Gamelan peking of Lampung, and Talempong of West Sumatra as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity from Indonesia, and encouraged the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government to safeguard, transmit, promote, and develop the gamelan. Methods include the support of national, international and provincial festivals, the establishment of educational curricula including the Gamelan Goes to School program, an intention to increase the numbers of regional gamelan associations, and cultural diplomacy by sending gamelan specialists to global universities.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Javanese word () in the &quot;ngoko&quot; register, which refers to playing of percussion instruments or the act of striking with a mallet, and the noun-forming suffix . The gamelan in the Sundanese is &quot;Degung&quot; (), the word &quot;Degung&quot; apparently is an old Sundanese term, which refers to gongs and gong ensembles. For this reason, the words &quot;degung&quot; and gong are essentially synonyms for the word . At the same time, the expression &quot;gamelan degung&quot; may be a way to point at a gamelan ensemble tuned to degung scale. The term () refers to classical gamelan music and performance practice, and comes from the Javanese word () of Sanskrit origin, meaning &#x27;intricate&#x27; or &#x27;finely worked&#x27;, referring to the sense of smoothness and elegance idealized in Javanese music. Another word, (), means a person with such sense, and is used as an honorific when discussing esteemed gamelan musicians. The Javanese word for in the register is (), formed either from the words () and () referring to the materials used in bronze gamelan construction (copper and tin), or () and () referring to their proportions (three and ten).

==History==
The gamelan predates the Hindu-Buddhist culture that dominated Indonesia in its earliest records and thus represents an indigenous art form of Indonesia. In contrast to the heavy Indian influence in other art forms, the only obvious Indian influence in gamelan music is in the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese style of singing, and in the themes of the Wayang kulit and Wayang Golek (shadow puppet plays).

In Javanese mythology, the gamelan was created by Sang Hyang Guru in Saka era 167 (), the god who ruled as king of all Java from a palace on the Maendra mountain in Medang Kamulan (now Mount Lawu). He needed a signal to summon the gods and thus invented the gong. For more complex messages, he invented two other gongs, thus forming the original gamelan set.

The earliest image of a musical ensemble is found on the bas-relief of the 8th century Buddhist monument of Borobudur, Central Java. The Borobudur&#x27;s musicians play lute-like stringed instruments, various &quot;kendang&quot; drums, various &quot;suling&quot; flutes, cymbals, bells, metallophones, and xylophones. Some of these musical instruments are indeed included in a complete gamelan orchestra. Musical instruments such as metallophones (saron, kenong, kecer), xylophones (gambang), the bamboo flute (suling), drums in various sizes (kendang), cymbals, bell (genta), and bowed and plucked string instruments were identified in this image. These reliefs of this musical ensemble are suggested to be the ancient form of the gamelan.

The instruments developed into their current form during the Majapahit Empire. According to the inscriptions and manuscripts (Nagarakretagama and Kakawin Sutasoma) dated from the Majapahit period, the kingdom even had a government office in charge of supervising the performing arts, including the gamelan. The arts office oversaw the construction of musical instruments, as well as scheduling performances at the court.

In Bali, there are several gamelan selonding that have existed since the 9th century during the Sri Kesari Warmadewa reign. Some words refer to gamelan selonding was found in some ancient Balinese inscriptions and manuscripts. Today, gamelan selonding is stored and preserved well in ancient temples of Bali. It is considered sacred and used for religious ceremony purposes, especially when the big ceremony is held. Gamelan Selonding is part of daily life and culture for some indigenous people in ancient villages such as Bungaya, Bugbug, Seraya, Tenganan Pegringsingan, Timbrah, Asak, Ngis, Bebandem, Besakih, and Selat in Karangasem Regency.

In the court of Java (Surakarta Sunanate and Yogyakarta Sultanate) the oldest known ensembles, Gamelan Munggang and Gamelan Kodok Ngorek, are apparently from the 12th century. These formed the basis of a &quot;loud style&quot; of music. These Gamelan are the oldest existing gamelan instruments and still preserved well in the courts. The Gamelans become the heirloom of the Javanese courts. Gamelan Kodhok Ngorek and Gamelan Monggang are sacred gamelan that will only be sounded for Javanese court ritual ceremonies such as the Sultan&#x27;s Jumenengan (coronation ceremony), welcoming highly respected guests at the palace, royal weddings, and Garebeg. This gamelan is only owned by the court and the general public is not allowed to have a similar gamelan set.

In the wengker or Ponorogo culture, in the 15th century Gamelan Reyog was not only used to accompany the art of Reog Ponorogo but was also used during war, the troops of ki Ageng Surya Alam from the village of Kutu played gamelan reyog before the war took place against Majapahit, which was in coalition with Demak during the attack. Wengker, as a result Wengker always gets his victory before the heirloom of ki Ageng Surya Alam falls into the hands of the enemy.

A &quot;soft style&quot; developed out of the &quot;kemanak&quot; tradition and is related to the traditions of singing Javanese poetry, in a manner often believed to be similar to the chorus that accompanies the modern &quot;bedhaya&quot; dance. In the 17th century, these loud and soft styles mixed, and to a large extent, the variety of modern gamelan styles of Bali, Java, and Sunda resulted from different ways of mixing these elements. Thus, despite the seeming diversity of styles, many of the same theoretical concepts, instruments, and techniques are shared between the styles.

In the Sultanate of Cirebon, on the north coast of Java. The gamelan Sakati in the Keraton Kasepuhan is originated from Demak Sultanate in 1495 which was a gift from Sultan Trenggono of Demak for the marriage of Ratu Mas Nyawa (daughter of Raden Patah, king of Demak) to Prince Bratakelana (son of Sunan Gunung Jati from his wife Syarifah Bagdad). This gamelan is closely related to the early days of the spread of Islam by Wali Sanga in Java. At the Keraton Kasepuhan, the gamelan Sakati is played on the Idul Adha month of Hajj (Zulhijah) in the Sri Manganti building when the sultan and his relatives head to the Grand Mosque. This gamelan is kept in the Museum Pusaka Keraton Kasepuhan Cirebon.

In Lamongan, East Java, there is an ancient gamelan from the 15th century called Gamelan &quot;Singo Mengkok&quot;. This gamelan is a legacy of the Sunan Drajat (one of the Wali Sanga) which was used for broadcasting the Islamic religion in Paciran, Lamongan. Beaten by the Friends of Sunan Drajat to accompany the tembang Pangkur (panguri isine Qur&#x27;an) created by Sunan Drajat himself. This gamelan ensemble is an acculturation of Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic culture, considering that the surrounding community is Hindus, so that it is easily accepted by the community. The Gamelan Singo Mengkok is now stored in the Museum Sunan Drajat in Lamongan.

In the kingdom of Islamic Mataram, Gamelan Kanjeng Kyai Guntur Sari was made in 1566 and Gamelan Kanjeng Kyai Guntur Madu was made in 1642 during the reign of Sultan Agung. Both gamelans called Gamelan Sekati (Gamelan Sekaten) which is only beaten/sounded to accompany the Sekaten ceremony. Gamelan Sekaten in Surakarta and Yogyakarta will be played once a year for one week in front of the Grand Mosque. This gamelan is only played by the royal family and courtiers under strict conditions, wearing prescribed traditional clothes, and playing certain sacred music that has existed for centuries. The Gamelan Sekaten exists in halves: divided between the two rival courts in Surakarta and Yogyakarta, each court had a matching second half made.

In Sumedang, West Java, there is an heirloom of the Kingdom of Sumedang Larang, there is a Gamelan Panglipur belonging to Prince Rangga Gede / Kusumahdinata IV (1625–1633) who is also the regent of Mataram. Gamelan was deliberately made to entertain himself after his beloved child died. The Panglipur gamelan along with 9 other ancient gamelan sets are kept at the Museum Prabu Geusan Ulun in Sumedang Regency. One of the ten sets of gamelan is the gamelan &quot;Sari Oneng Parakansalak&quot; from Sukabumi, West Java, which on 31 March 1889, participated in celebrating the inauguration of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.

On 5 September 1977, &quot;Gending ketawang puspawarna&quot; (Javanese gamelan music) which was created by Mangkunegara IV (1853–1881) was carried by two satellites of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) named &quot;Voyager I&quot; and &quot;Voyager II&quot;. The satellites are in charge of making observations on planets in outer space. The two satellites are equipped with gold-plated copper disks with a diameter of 12 inches. This disc contains recorded messages from Earth for extraterrestrials who can find them.

==Instruments==

A gamelan is a multi-timbre ensemble consisting of metallophones, xylophones, flutes, gongs, voices, as well as bowed and plucked strings. The hand-played drum called &quot;kendang&quot; controls the tempo and rhythm of pieces as well as transitions from one section to another, while one instrument gives melodic cues to indicate treatment or sections of a piece.

===Typical Javanese gamelan instruments===
In the courts of Java, Javanese gamelan is grouped into 2 groups of gamelan, namely gamelan Pakurmatan and gamelan Ageng. Gamelan pakurmatan is the gamelan used for special Javanese court events and all of them are sacred gamelan. The gamelan pakurmatan consists of the gamelan kodhok ngorek, the gamelan monggang, the gamelan sekati, and the gamelan carabalen. As for the gamelan ageng is considered the most complete in the Javanese court. The Gamelan Ageng instruments are usually owned by the general public (artists, schools, studios, and other communities) in Java and outside Java. This gamelan is used to accompany arts or rituals either in the palace or in the general public, the gamelan can use a complete gamelan or less.

===Typical Balinese gamelan instruments===
In Bali, the Gamelan instruments are all kept together in a &quot;balé&quot;, a large open space with a roof over the top of it and several open sides. Gambelan (the Balinese term) are owned by a &quot;banjar&quot;, nobility or temples and kept in their respective compounds. In case of &quot;banjar&quot; ownership the instruments are all kept there together because people believe that all the instruments belong to the community as a whole and that no one person has ownership over an instrument. Not only is this where the instruments are stored, but this is also the practice space for the &quot;sekaha&quot; (Gamelan orchestra group). The open walls allow for the music to flow out into the community where the rest of the people may enjoy it. Balinese gamelan cannot be heard inside closed rooms, because it easily crosses the threshold of pain. This does not apply to small ensembles like a gamelan &quot;gendér&quot;.

The &quot;sekaha&quot; is led by a single instructor whose job it is in the community to lead this group and to come up with new pieces. When they are working on a new piece, the instructor will lead the group in practice and help the group form the new music as they are practicing. When the instructor creates a new song, he leaves enough open for interpretation that the group can improvise, so the group will write the music as they practice it. There are many styles in Balinese gamelan. &quot;Kebyar&quot; is one of the most recent ones. Some Balinese gamelan groups constantly change their music by taking older pieces they know and mixing them together, as well as trying new variations of the music. Their music constantly changes because they believe that music should grow and change; the only exception to this is with their most sacred songs which they do not change. A single new piece of music can take several months before it is completed. Men and women usually perform in separate groups.

A set of complete Balinese gamelan ensemble consists of:

# 1 set (12 pieces) Reyong 
# 1 set (10 pieces) Trompong
# 1 piece Gong Wadon
# 1 piece Gong Lanang
# 1 piece Gong Kempur
# 1 piece Gong Klentong
# 1 piece Gong Bende

==Notation==
The tuning and construction of a gamelan orchestra is a complex process. Javanese gamelan use two tuning systems: &quot;sléndro&quot; and &quot;pélog&quot;. There are other tuning systems such as &quot;degung&quot; (exclusive to Sunda, or West Java, similar to a Japanese &quot;ryukyuan scale&quot;), and &quot;madenda&quot; (similar to a Japanese hirajoshi scale). In central Javanese gamelan, &quot;sléndro&quot; is a system with five notes to the octave, with large intervals, while &quot;pélog&quot; has seven notes to the octave, with uneven intervals, usually played in five note subsets of the seven-tone collection. A full gamelan will include a set of instruments in each tuning, and classically only one tuning is used at a time. The precise tuning used differs from ensemble to ensemble and gives each ensemble its own particular flavor. A set of gamelan instruments will be tuned to the same set of notes, but the tuning will vary from one gamelan to the next, including variations in the size of intervals.

Colin McPhee, a Canadian composer who spent much time in Bali, remarked, &quot;Deviations in what is considered the same scale are so large that one might with reason state that there are as many scales as there are gamelans.&quot; This view is contested, however, by some teachers of gamelan, and there have been efforts to combine multiple ensembles and tuning structures into one gamelan to ease transportation at festival time. One such ensemble is gamelan &quot;Manikasanti&quot;, which can play the repertoire of many different ensembles.
Balinese gamelan instruments are built in pairs that are tuned slightly apart to produce interference beats, ideally at a consistent speed for all pairs of notes in all registers. This concept is referred to as &quot;ombak,&quot; translating to &quot;wave,&quot; communicating the idea of cyclical undulation. One instrument, tuned slightly higher, is thought of as the &quot;inhale,&quot; and the other, slightly lower, is called the &quot;exhale&quot; (Also called the &quot;blower&quot; and the &quot;sucker,&quot; or &quot;pengimbang&quot; and &quot;pengisep&quot; in Bali). When the inhale and the exhale are combined, beating is produced, meant to represent the beating of the heart, or the symbol of being alive. It is thought that this contributes to the &quot;shimmering&quot; sound of Balinese gamelan ensembles. In the religious ceremonies that contain gamelan, these interference beats are meant to give the listener a feeling of a god&#x27;s presence or a stepping stone to a meditative state. The scale roughly approximates that of the phrygian mode of the Western major scale (E-E on the white keys of the piano), with the notes EFGBC corresponding to the note positions 12356 in the &quot;slendro&quot; scale used by most gamelan.

In addition to non-western scales, Javanese gamelan uses a combination of tempo and density known as &quot;Irama&quot;, relating how many beats on the &quot;saron panerus&quot; instrument there are to notes in the core melody or &quot;balungan&quot;; density is considered primary.

===Slendro===
Slendro notation generally produces a light, cheerful atmosphere and feels busier. This is evidenced by the scenes in the wayang kulit and wayang wong performances such as scenes of war and marching that accompanied by slendro notation. The use of the slendro can also have the opposite impression, such as sad or romantic. As in the case of gending that uses a slendro miring. Slendro miring is a slendro notation tone that is played out of place on purpose. Therefore, there are many scenes of homesickness, love missing, sadness, death, languishing accompanied by slendro tunes.

===Pelog===
Pelog notation produces an atmosphere that gives the impression of being manly, regal, and sacred, especially in the musical play that uses the pelog nem (six) notation. Therefore, there are many scenes that are accompanied by pelog tunings, such as scenes where a king enters the pamelegan (place of worship), scenes of heartache, scenes of anger, or scenes that express revenge. However, in the play of certain notes, the pelog tunings can also give the impression of being happy, light, and lively, for example in the music played on the pelog tunings of barang.

===Kepatihan===

Gamelan music is traditionally not notated and began as an oral tradition. In the 19th century, however, the kraton (palaces) of Yogyakarta and Surakarta developed distinct notations for transcribing the repertoire. These were not used to read the music, which was memorized, but to preserve pieces in the court records. The Yogyanese notation is a checkerboard notation, which uses six or seven vertical lines to represent notes of higher pitch in the balungan (melodic framework), and horizontal lines which represent the series of beats, read downward with time. The fourth vertical line and every fourth horizontal line (completing a &quot;gatra&quot;) are darkened for legibility. Symbols on the left indicate the colotomic or metric structure of gongs and so forth, while specific drum features are notated in symbols to the right. The Solonese notation reads horizontally, like Western notation, but does not use barlines. Instead, note values and rests are squiggled between the notes.

Today this notation is relatively rare, and has been replaced by kepatihan notation, which is based on the Galin-Paris-Chevé system. Kepatihan notation developed around 1900 at the kepatihan Palace in Surakarta, which had become a high-school conservatory. The pitches are numbered (see the articles on the scales &quot;slendro&quot; and &quot;pélog&quot; for an explanation of how), and are read across with dots below or above the numbers indicating the register, and lines above notes showing time values; In vocal notation, there are also brackets under groups of notes to indicate melisma. Like the palace notation, however, Kepatihan records mostly the &quot;balungan&quot; part and its metric phrases as marked by a variety of gongs. The other parts are created in real time, and depend on the knowledge each musician has of his instrument, and his awareness of what others are playing; this &quot;realization&quot; is sometimes called &quot;garap.&quot; Some teachers have also devised certain notations, generally using kepatihan principles, for the &quot;cengkok&quot; (melodic patterns) of the elaborating instruments. Some ethnomusicologists, trained in European music, may make transcriptions onto a Western staff. This entails particular challenges of tuning and time, sometimes resulting in unusual clefs.

==Varieties==

Varieties of gamelan are distinguished by their collection of instruments and use of voice, tunings, repertoire, style, and cultural context. In general, no two gamelan ensembles are the same, and those that arose in prestigious courts are often considered to have their own style and tuning. Certain styles may also be shared by nearby ensembles, leading to a regional style. The varieties are generally grouped geographically, with the principal division between the styles favored by the Balinese, Javanese, and Sundanese peoples. Javanese gamelan has soft and slow tones, while Balinese gamelan has strong and dynamic tones with fast music rhythms, while Sundanese gamelan which is dominated by the sound of flutes makes it not only soft but also mellow.

===Javanese gamelan===
Javanese gamelan is a gamelan that originates and develops in the Central Java and East Java, including the Special Region of Yogyakarta. In the Javanese palaces, the gamelan is divided into two, namely the gamelan pakurmatan and gamelan ageng. Gamelan pakurmatan is used for certain events or rituals in the royal environment. The gamelan pakurmatan set is not as complete as the ageng gamelan, and its shape and pitch are somewhat different from the traditional gamelan owned by the community. Gamelan pakurmatan consists of gamelan kodhok Ngorek, gamelan munggang, gamelan sekati, and gamelan carabalen, while gamelan ageng is the most complete gamelan used for various traditional ceremonies and events in the palace.

Gamelan outside the palace, owned by the general public, is usually the gamelan ageng, although it is not as complete as that of the palace, according to the needs and objectives of the gamelan ownership. The Javanese gamelan used by the communities has many kinds and types including the gamelan gadhon, gamelan siteran, gamelan Wayang, gamelan bambu, gamelan prawa, gamelan pelog, gamelan renteng, gamelan slendro, gamelan Banyuwangi, and gamelan Madura.

In oral Javanese culture distinctions are made between complete or incomplete, archaic and modern, and large standard and small village gamelan. The various archaic ensembles are distinguished by their unique combinations of instruments and possession of obsolete instruments such as the bell-tree (&quot;byong&quot;) in the 3-toned &quot;gamelan kodhok ngorek&quot;. Regionally variable village gamelan are often distinguished from standard gamelan (which have the &quot;rebab&quot; as the main melodic instrument) by their inclusion of a double-reed wind (&quot;selompret&quot;, &quot;slompret&quot;, or &quot;sompret&quot;) in addition to variable drum and gong components, with some also including the shaken bamboo &quot;angklung&quot;.

Gamelan in Javanese society is a product of local wisdom that has survived to this day. The long history that has been passed by Javanese gamelan is a cultural struggle that continues to be sustainable until now and in the future. Gamelan is inseparable from Javanese customs and human life, where gamelan is almost always there in every Javanese ceremony are held. Javanese gamelan is generally used to accompany dances, dance dramas, theater, puppets, rituals, events and festivals. Until then it developed in such a way that it was able to stand as a separate musical performance, complete with the accompaniment of the voices of the sindhen.

Most of the music rhythms are generally soft and reflect the harmony of life, as the principles of life are generally adopted by Javanese society. Some of them sound quickly according to the event or ritual being held or accompanied by the gamelan like gamelan Banyuwangi which has a faster tempo and uses high notes. Javanese gamelan has pelog and slendro tunings, if the pelog consists of notations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (ji, ro, lu, pat, mo, nem, tu), slendro has notation 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, i (ji, ro, lu, mo, nem, i).

===Balinese gamelan===
Balinese gamelan is one type of traditional gamelan ensemble that originates and develops in the island of Bali. Balinese gamelan is an inseparable ensemble of Balinese life, almost all villages in Bali have gamelan. The gamelan can be used as part of Hindu worship in Bali or as community entertainment in the Banjar in villages of Bali. Because gamelan also functions as a medium for socializing with each other, it can be seen that playing gamelan requires cooperation between players to get the desired tone or sound harmony. This Balinese gamelan has several differences from gamelan instruments in general, both in form and how to play it. This Balinese gamelan is usually performed as an accompaniment to an art performance in Bali, both sacred and entertainment.

Balinese gamelan is often used to accompany religious ceremonies and entertainment. In terms of religion, Balinese Gamelan is often displayed to accompany the running of religious ceremonies or to accompany sacred traditional dances. Meanwhile, in terms of entertainment, Balinese Gamelan is often presented as a musical performance as well as accompaniment to various arts that are entertainment in Bali.

Gamelan in Bali known as gambelan is commonly used in traditional ritual processions such as death ceremonies which we know as the Ngaben tradition. Meanwhile, for human ceremonies, gender is used and for ceremonies in temples, gong gede is usually used. In terms of the development of the era, Balinese gamelan can be divided into 3 types:
*Gamelan wayah. This old type of gamelan is thought to have existed before the 15th century. This gamelan is generally dominated by keys in the form of keys and does not use drums (Selonding, Gender Wayang, Baleganjur, Genggong, Gambang, Angklung, Bebonangan, Geng Beri, Caruk, Gong Luwang)
*Gamelan madya. This gamelan comes from around the 16th-19th century. In this era, the barungan gamelan already used drums and tuned instruments. In this barungan, drums have started to play a role in a show (Bebarongan, Pelegongan, Batel Barong, Joged Pingitan, Penggambuhan, Gong Gedé, Semar Pagulingan)
*Gamelan anyar. This gamelan includes a new type of group, which includes the types of gamelan barungan that emerged in the 20th century. This gamelan barungan appears in one of the most prominent features, namely the game of drums (Semaradana, Bumbung Gebyog, Adi Merdangga, Jégog, Manikasanti, Bumbang, Gong Suling, Joged Bumbung, Janger, Geguntangan, Genta Pinara Pitu, Kendang Mabarung, Gong Kebyar, Okakan or Grumbungan, Tektekan)

===Sundanese gamelan===
The Sundanese gamelan is one of the typical gamelan ensemble from West Java and Banten province (Tatar Pasundan ) in Indonesia. In the manuscript Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian, the art of gamelan is estimated to have entered in the 16th century. In this text, at that time there was a gamelan player called K&quot;umbang Gending&quot; and a musical expert called &quot;Paraguna&quot;. Sundanese gamelan is also called Degung. The word Degung is said to have originated from the word &quot;Ratu-agung&quot; or &quot;Tumenggung&quot;, because at that time Gamelan Degung was very popular with the officials. There are three types of Sundanese gamelan, including:
*Gamelan salendro is usually used to accompany wayang performances, dances, and cliningan. Because it is often used in the performing arts, the salendro gamelan is also a popular gamelan among other gamelan types.
*Gamelan renteng. This gamelan developed in several places, one of which is in Batu Karut, Cikalong. Based on the form and intervals of the gamelan renteng, there is an opinion that most likely the current Sundanese gamelan started from the gamelan renteng.
*Gamelan ketuk tilu. This gamelan is usually used to accompany the arts of ketuk tilu, ronggeng gunung, ronggeng ketuk, doger, and topeng banjet.

Outside the main core on Java and Bali, gamelan has spread through migration and cultural interest, new styles sometimes resulting as well. The variety of gamelan can be found in over 25 countries outside Indonesia, presenting both traditional and experimental repertoire.

==Cultural context==
For some Indonesians, gamelan has high philosophical values, in terms of sound, roles, and the feelings of the players. Playing gamelan is not just the ability to play various musical instruments together, thus giving birth to the harmony of tones and rhythms. But also, by playing the gamelan there is a meaning that describes the system of deliberation and consensus in the midst of society, through each gamelan musical instrument. Gamelan symbolizes the spirit of cohesiveness and mutual cooperation, together, and in line. So that it gives birth to a harmonious tone in social life. In Indonesia, gamelan accompanies many cultural activities such as:

===Religious rituals===
Under the influence of the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit kingdom, gamelan was used as accompaniment in religious ceremonies with tembang (singing) and wayang performances. Even an accompaniment to a king&#x27;s performance. In the Negarakertagama manuscripts written by Mpu Prapanca in the 14th century. It is said that the gamelan accompaniment was used by King Hayam Wuruk in performing a mask dance with eight young people accompanied by a song from the Queen Mother. With the collapse of the Majapahit kingdom and being replaced by the Islamic kingdom of Demak led by Raden Patah, gamelan as a traditional musical instrument did not just disappear. Its function is used as a media tool for preaching Islam.

Gamelan&#x27;s role in rituals is so important that there is a Javanese saying, &quot;It is not official until the gong is hung&quot;. Some performances are associated with royalty, such as visits by the sultan of Yogyakarta. Certain gamelans are associated with specific rituals, such as the &quot;Gamelan Sekaten&quot;, which is used in the celebration of &quot;Mawlid an-Nabi&quot; (Muhammad&#x27;s birthday). In Bali, almost all religious rituals include gamelan performance. Gamelan is also used in the ceremonies of the Catholic church in Indonesia. Certain pieces are designated for starting and ending performances or ceremonies. When an &quot;ending&quot; piece (such as &quot;Udan Mas&quot;) is begun, the audience will know that the event is nearly finished and will begin to leave. Certain pieces are also believed to possess magic powers and can be used to ward off evil spirits. The religious rituals that accompanied by gamelan such as: sekaten, temple rituals, melasti, galungan, Ogoh-ogoh, etc.

===Ceremonies===
Gamelan is used to accompany various traditional ceremonies in Indonesia, gamelan kodhok ngorek, gamelan monggang, gamelan carabalen, and gamelan ageng are used for important ceremonies related to kings in the Yogyakarta and Surakarta palaces such as the king&#x27;s coronations ceremony, the king&#x27;s birthday ceremony, the coronation anniversary, royal guest reception, baby birth, marriage, death, and so on.
Outside the palace in Java, gamelan is used for Wedding reception, birth ceremonies, circumcision ceremonies, rice harvesting, ruwatan ceremonies, and death ceremonies (dhukitan). The musical presentation in the dhukitan ceremony in the general public is different from that in Palace. Gendhing at dhukitan ceremonies in the palace use the kodhok ngorek gamelan instrument, only intended for the death of the king and his family and only served when the corpse departs to the cemetery. Meanwhile, gendhing offerings at duhkitan ceremonies in the general public (outside the palace environment) are usually served at the time of the death of musical artists of dance, musical puppetry, wayang orang, cultural observers, and theater using the gamelan gadhon ensemble.

===Traditional dances===
Almost all dances originating from the island of Java and Bali are accompanied by gamelan music. Gamelan gives spirit and beauty to live dance performances. The sound of the gamelan music brings dance to life and graceful to see. The main function of the gamelan as a dance accompaniment is to provide rhythm, beat, or tempo guidance. So that the selection of accompanying music must be adjusted to the rhythm and theme of the dance. Dance performance using live gamelan is a complex artistic activity. Gamelan in dance is used as an illustration or support for the atmosphere. The accompanying gamelan music must give the impression of &quot;speaking&quot; or communication and constitute the perfect unity between music and dance. Typically players in the gamelan will be familiar with dance moves and poetry, while dancers are able to play in the ensemble. Some examples of famous dance include: bedhaya, serimpi, gambyong, Bambangan Cakil, legong, oleg tamulilingan, pendet, cendrawasih, barong, baris, jaipong, topeng, Bajidor Kahot, gandrung, etc.

===Dance-drama performances===
Dance drama in Indonesia is a show that combines dance and drama, which tells a story with dialogue or without dialogue between the players, usually guided by a puppeteer. This show is accompanied by gamelan music and involves many players who wear a typical costume. Gamelan music as accompaniment is widely used for choreography in the form of storytelling performances, both drama, and dance drama. Gamelan music that accompanies dance drama is a combination of music whose rhythm is in accordance with the dance movements and as an illustration. Most dance-dramas use music to avoid monotony and be more varied, and for the sake of harmony between dance and music.
Ramayana Ballet is a form of Javanese dance-drama performance that does not use dialogue. Dialogue in ballet performances is replaced with gesticulation or meaningful movements, especially with attitudes, hand movements, and head. Gesticulation or meaningful movements are movements that have a visual meaning or purpose that can be used and implemented by the audiences. Some examples of dance-dramas in Indonesia are as follows: wayang wong, wayang topeng, Ramayana Ballet, etc.

===Wayang puppet performances===
Gamelan is used to accompany all puppet shows, including wayang kulit, wayang golek, wayang klithik, wayang beber, etc. In &quot;wayang&quot;, the &quot;dalang&quot; (puppeteer) must have a thorough knowledge of gamelan, as he gives the cues for the music. Gamelan is a complement and supporter of wayang performances, which is still favored by Indonesians. Gamelan is played to support the atmosphere that Dalang (puppet master) wants to build in a wayang performance. Gamelan, which is the music accompanying the puppet show, is played in pelog or slendro tones according to the atmosphere of the scene being played. Gamelan music supports the delivery of values in wayang performances. The type of gamelan music for puppetry is different from gamelan music for dance or ordinary musical songs.

===Traditional theatre performances===
Traditional theater, especially on the islands of Java and Bali, is mostly accompanied by gamelan. Traditional theaters such as kethoprak, ludruk, and sandiwara are accompanied by gamelan to enliven the show. Ketoprak is a traditional theater founded in central Java. The story is usually about the life of Javanese palaces and noblemen, often about the romance of the royal family members. Ketoprak is often performed in celebrations, such as weddings, circumcision, and Independence Day. It differs from Ludruk from east Java, which uses a contemporary setting and the story of common people and their economic struggles. All the performers of ludruk are males, even the female role is played by males. While Sandiwara is a traditional theatrical drama from west Java.

===Singing performance===
Gamelan can be performed by itself – in &quot;klenengan&quot; style, or for radio broadcasts – and concerts presentation are common in national arts conservatories founded in the middle of the 20th century. Gamelan is frequently played on the radio. For example, the &quot;Pura Pakualaman&quot; gamelan performs live on the radio every &quot;Minggu Pon&quot; (a day in the 35-day cycle of the Javanese calendar). In major towns, the Radio Republik Indonesia employs professional musicians and actors, and broadcast programs of a wide variety of gamelan music and drama. In the court tradition of central Java, gamelan is often played in the &quot;pendopo&quot;, an open pavilion with a cavernous, double-pitched roof, no side walls, and a hard marble or tile floor. The instruments are placed on a platform to one side, which allows the sound to reverberate in the roof space and enhances the acoustics. Some traditional genre music is accompanied by gamelan ensemble like Javanese poetry, tembang sunda, campursari, etc.

===Festival===
Many festivals are held in Indonesia, most of them using gamelan to enliven the event. Usually, gamelan is used for entertainment performances or even gamelan becomes the theme of the festival. Several gamelan festivals in Indonesia are held regularly, such as the Gamelan festival in Solo, Yogyakarta International gamelan festival, Balinese art festival, and many more.

==Gamelan production==

Most of the metal gamelan instruments are made of bronze or brass or iron, while some are made of wood, bamboo, leather, and strings. Gangsa is short for Tigang (three) and Sedasa (ten), the term for gamelan in the high Javanese language based on the composition of the ingredients for making the best gamelan (bronze), namely ten parts copper and three parts tin. Pande is the name for a gamelan maker, while Pelaras is a person who adjusts the gamelan tone to match the existing gamelan standards. In the process of making gamelan, there are at least five stages that must be passed to make a good gamelan. The five stages include:

&quot;Membesot&quot; – to melt the mixture, a gamelan craftsman will prepare the kowi, which is a bowl-like container made of clay. In this process, a fireplace equipped with a heating device is prepared to produce maximum heat. The kowi is then filled with metals and other alloys, such as copper or silver to produce a nice plate color.

&quot;Menyinggi&quot; – the metal base material is melted back to be printed into a blade or round shape. There are three forms of gamelan that are made at this stage, namely, the long form (dawan), the long semicircle, and the cebongan form. To maintain sacredness, usually at this stage flower water is used to soak the gamelan that has been printed.

&quot;Menempa&quot; – the gamelan that has been printed then goes into the forging or shaping stage to produce a perfect shape. The forging stage is the most complex stage in the gamelan-making process. In this stage, the process is carried out by people who really understand the ins and outs of gamelan, considering that the forging process is not done carelessly, but uses various hitting techniques using various kinds of hammers.

&quot;Membabar&quot; – the forged gamelan is then examined again at the spreading stage. At this stage, if there are still defects in the shape, it will be corrected again.

&quot;Melaras&quot; – there is one more important process that must be done to produce a perfect gamelan set, namely the process of adjusting the scales. Therefore, one more stage is needed to produce a gamelan with perfect physical and function, that stage is to adjust the scale.

After adjusting to the scale, the blades and circles are ready to be installed in the cage. It is at this stage that the manufacture of various gamelan instruments has been physically and functionally completed. Some craftsmen, although rarely found, complement the making of gamelan with various rituals, such as fasting and providing offerings. This is of course to produce a gamelan that is not only perfect physically and functionally, but also philosophically.

Gamelan production centers are spread across the islands of Java and Bali. These gamelan producers have exported hundreds and supplied gamelan all over the world. Several gamelan production centers are located in Sukoharjo, Boyolali, Wonogiri, Nganjuk, Magetan, Bantul, Ponorogo, Klaten, Banyuwangi, Gunung Kidul, Cimahi, Bogor, Gianyar, and Klungkung.

==Influence on Western music==

The gamelan has been appreciated by several western composers of classical music, most famously Claude Debussy, who heard a Javanese gamelan in the premiere of Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsodie Cambodgienne&quot; at the Paris Exposition of 1889 (World&#x27;s Fair). The work had been written seven years earlier in 1882, but received its premiere only in 1889. The gamelan Debussy heard in it was in the &quot;slendro&quot; scale and was played by Central Javanese musicians. Despite his enthusiasm, direct citations of gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, or ensemble textures have not been located in any of Debussy&#x27;s own compositions. However, the equal-tempered whole tone scale appears in his music of this time and afterward, and a Javanese gamelan-like heterophonic texture is emulated on occasion, particularly in &quot;Pagodes&quot;, from &quot;Estampes&quot; (solo piano, 1903), in which the great gong&#x27;s cyclic punctuation is symbolized by a prominent perfect fifth.

The composer Erik Satie, an influential contemporary of Debussy, also heard the Javanese gamelan play at the Paris Exposition of 1889. The repetitively hypnotic effects of the gamelan were incorporated into Satie&#x27;s Gnossienne set for piano.

Direct homages to gamelan music are to be found in works for western instruments by John Cage, particularly his prepared piano pieces, Béla Bartók, Francis Poulenc, Leopold Godowsky, Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, Bronislaw Kaper and Benjamin Britten. Colin McPhee, Lou Harrison and Claude Vivier would travel to Bali and Java to document the theory of gamelan, and subsequently incorporated it in their compositions. In more recent times, American composers such as Henry Brant, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Dennis Murphy, Loren Nerell, Michael Tenzer, Evan Ziporyn, Daniel James Wolf and Jody Diamond as well as Australian composers such as Peter Sculthorpe, Andrew Schultz, Paul Grabowsky and Ross Edwards have written several works with parts for gamelan instruments or full gamelan ensembles. Several New Zealand composers have composed for gamelan or incorporated elements of gamelan into their music such as Jack Body, Gareth Farr and Anthony Ritchie.

I Nyoman Windha is among contemporary Indonesian composers who have written compositions using western instruments along with Gamelan. Hungarian composer György Ligeti wrote a piano étude called &quot;Galamb Borong&quot; influenced by gamelan. Avant-garde composer Harry Partch, one of America&#x27;s most idiosyncratic composers, was also influenced by Gamelan, both in his microtonal compositions and the instruments he built for their performance

In jazz, the music of Don Cherry, especially his 1968 record &quot;Eternal Rhythm&quot;, shows influences of gamelan music.

American folk guitarist John Fahey included elements of gamelan in many of his late-1960s sound collages, and again in his 1997 collaboration with Cul de Sac, &quot;The Epiphany of Glenn Jones.&quot; Influenced by gamelan, Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew used rhythmically interlocking guitars in their duets with each other in the 1981–1984 trilogy of albums (&quot;Discipline&quot;, &quot;Beat&quot;, &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot;) by rock band King Crimson and with &quot;The League of Crafty Guitarists&quot;. The gamelan has also been used by British multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield at least three times, &quot;Woodhenge&quot; (1979), &quot;The Wind Chimes (Part II)&quot; (1987) and &quot;Nightshade&quot; (2005).

On the debut EP of Sonic Youth the track &#x27;She&#x27;s not Alone&#x27; has a gamelan timbre. Experimental pop groups The Residents, 23 Skidoo (whose 1984 album was even titled &quot;Urban Gamelan&quot;), Mouse on Mars, His Name Is Alive, Xiu Xiu, Macha, Saudade, The Raincoats and the Sun City Girls have used gamelan percussion. Avant-garde performance band Melted Men uses Balinese gamelan instruments as well as gamelan-influenced costumes and dance in their shows. The Moodswinger built by Yuri Landman gives gamelan–like clock and bell sounds, because of its 3rd bridge construction. Indonesian-Dutch composer Sinta Wullur has integrated Western music and gamelan for opera. Canadian Band Godspeed You! Black Emperor are notably influenced by gamelan even naming a live track simply &quot;Gamelan&quot; before changing its name to &quot;We Drift Like Worried fire&quot; for their 2012 album &#x27;Allelujah! Don&#x27;t Bend! Ascend!

==Influence on contemporary music==

In contemporary Indonesian music scene, some groups fuse contemporary westernized jazz fusion music with the legacy of traditional ethnic music traditions. In the case of Krakatau and SambaSunda, the bands from West Java, the traditional Sundanese kacapi suling and gamelan degung Sunda orchestra is performed alongside drum set, keyboard and guitars. Other bands such as Bossanova Java fused Javanese music with bossa nova, while the Kulkul band fuse jazz with Balinese gamelan.

The Indonesian singer Anggun often incorporated in her works Indonesian traditional tunes from the gamelan and tembang style of singing. Typical gamelan tunes can be traced in several songs in her album &quot;Snow on the Sahara&quot; such as &quot;Snow on the Sahara&quot;, &quot;A Rose in the Wind&quot;, and also in her collaboration works with Deep Forest on &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; on their 2002 album, &quot;Music Detected&quot;. Philippine-born Indonesian singer Maribeth Pascua also features gamelan tunes in her songs &quot;Denpasar Moon&quot; and &quot;Borobudur&quot;.

Beyond Indonesia, gamelan has also had an influence on Japanese popular music, specifically the synthpop band Yellow Magic Orchestra. Their 1981 record &quot;Technodelic&quot;, one of the first albums to heavily rely on samples and loops, made use of gamelan elements and samples. Yellow Magic Orchestra member Ryuichi Sakamoto also used gamelan elements for his soundtrack to the 1983 British-Japanese film &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;, which won him the 1983 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.

Many listeners were introduced to the sounds of gamelan by the popular 1988 Japanese anime film &quot;Akira&quot;. Gamelan elements are used in this film to punctuate several exciting fight scenes, as well as to symbolize the emerging psychic powers of the tragic hero, Tetsuo. The gamelan in the film&#x27;s score was performed by the members of the Japanese musical collective Geinoh Yamashirogumi, using their &quot;semar pegulingan&quot; and &quot;jegog&quot; ensembles, which were also used in the previous album, &quot;Ecophony Rinne&quot;. Gamelan and kecak are also used in the soundtrack to the video games &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;, and &quot;Hotline Miami 2&quot;. The two opening credits of 1998 Japanese Anime &quot;Neo Ranga&quot; use Balinese music (&quot;Kecak&quot; and &quot;Gamelan gong kebyar&quot;). Each &quot;waking up&quot; of Ranga in the anime uses the &quot;Gong Kebyar&quot; theme. The musical soundtrack for the Sci Fi Channel series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; features extensive use of the gamelan, particularly in the 3rd season, as do Alexandre Desplat&#x27;s scores for &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; and &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;. James Newton Howard, who composed Disney&#x27;s 2001 feature film &quot;&quot;, chose Gamelan for the musical theme of the Atlanteans.

Loops of gamelan music appear in electronic music. An early example is the Texas band Drain&#x27;s album &quot;Offspeed and In There&quot;, which contains two tracks where trip-hop beats are matched with gamelan loops from Java and Bali and recent popular examples include the Sofa Surfers&#x27; piece &quot;Gamelan&quot;, or &quot;EXEC_PURGER/.#AURICA extracting&quot;, a song sung by Haruka Shimotsuki as part of the &quot;Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia&quot; soundtracks.

Gamelan influences can also be heard in the 2004 award-winning pop song, &quot;Pulangkan&quot;, a theme from the gamelan-cultural related film &quot;Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam&quot; by Malaysian songbird Misha Omar and also the 2006 hip hop song, Tokyo Drift (Fast &amp; Furious), by Teriyaki Boyz.

In the &quot;Regular Show&quot; episode &quot;150-Piece Kit&quot;, a gamelan is mentioned to be part of the eponymous kit.

==Gamelan outside Indonesia==
Gamelan is widely known in Indonesia and abroad. There are many gamelan groups outside Indonesia. This is due to several factors like Indonesian migration (Javanese, Balinese, or Sundanese) and cultural interest, which brought and introduced gamelan abroad. The government of Indonesia is also actively promoting culture abroad through cultural missions and actively opening Darmasiswa Scholarships for foreign students and lecturers who want to learn Indonesian culture, one of the most preferred is Gamelan. Indonesia has exported hundreds of gamelans and supplied gamelan all over the world. Gamelan has spread to almost all continents such as the Americas (United States, Mexico, Canada, Suriname), Europe (United Kingdom, Russia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Italy, France, Spain, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Netherland, Poland, Portugal), Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, China, Japan, Korea), Australia and New Zealand.

<text>The Emigrants () is a 1971 Swedish drama film directed and co-written by Jan Troell, and starring Max von Sydow, Liv Ullmann, Eddie Axberg, Allan Edwall, Monica Zetterlund, and Pierre Lindstedt. It and its 1972 sequel, &quot;The New Land&quot; (&quot;Nybyggarna&quot;), which were produced concurrently, are based on Vilhelm Moberg&#x27;s &quot;The Emigrants&quot;, a series of novels about poor Swedes who emigrate from Småland, Sweden, in the mid-19th century and make their home in Minnesota. This film adapts the first two of the four novels (&quot;The Emigrants&quot; (1949) and &quot;Unto a Good Land&quot; (1952)), which depict the hardships the emigrants experience in Sweden and on their journey to America.

&quot;The Emigrants&quot; won international acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 44th Academy Awards. It was nominated for four more Oscars the following year, including for Best Picture, the same year that &quot;The New Land&quot; was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. The 1974 American television series &quot;The New Land&quot; is loosely based on both &quot;The Emigrants&quot; and its sequel.

==Plot==
In 1844, the Nilsson family lives on a small farm in Korpamoen in Ljuder Parish in the Swedish province of Småland. Eldest son, Karl Oskar, runs the farm after his father, Nils, is injured. Karl Oskar marries Kristina Johansdotter. In the following years, Karl Oskar and Kristina have four children, Anna, Johan, Märta and Harald. The family struggles with rock-filled fields, poor weather, and bad harvests, leaving them hungry and in debt. Kristina rebukes Karl Oskar for his irreligious attitude, partially blaming it for causing their problems.

Karl Oskar&#x27;s daydreaming and bookish younger brother, Robert, tired of being overworked and regularly beaten as an indentured farmhand at Aron&#x27;s farm, reads about how wonderful America is and decides to emigrate. He asks Arvid, his fellow farmhand, to come with him. Arvid agrees, but their hopes are dashed upon realizing they are unable to afford passage. Robert wants to sell his share of the family farm to Karl Oskar, only to learn that Karl Oskar has also considered going to America. Despite the potential for a better life, Kristina is unenthusiastic, not wanting to leave her homeland and concerns about the arduous journey. However, when daughter Anna dies after gorging on uncooked porridge that ruptures her stomach, a devastated Kristina agrees to Karl Oskar&#x27;s plan to leave Sweden.

Meanwhile, Danjel Andreasson, Kristina&#x27;s uncle, is being persecuted by Brusander, the local provost, for rejecting the official religion and holding fundamentalist religious services at his home. He and his wife, Inga-Lena, and their four young children are exiled, so they join Karl Oskar in his move to America. Ulrika of Västergöhl, a former prostitute who is one of Danjel&#x27;s followers, and her illegitimate sixteen-year-old daughter, Elin, also join them, and Jonas Petter, a neighbor, is interested to escape his unhappy marriage. Robert is able to persuade Danjel to hire Arvid and pay his fare. Before their departure, Kristina tells Karl Oskar she is pregnant.

The emigrants travel to Karlshamn and board the wooden brig &quot;Charlotta&quot;, bound for New York City. On board, Karl Oskar and Kristina meet Måns and Fina-Kajsa Andersson, an elderly couple heading for the Minnesota Territory to settle on their son Anders&#x27; farm near a town called Taylor&#x27;s Falls. After hearing how good the land is there, Karl Oskar and Kristina decide to follow them. During the voyage, Inga-Lena and Måns Andersson die of unrelated sudden illnesses, and Kristina nearly dies from a severe nosebleed.

Upon arrival in New York, Karl Oskar and his party, along with Fina-Kajsa, travel westward to Minnesota, first by train, and then by riverboat. Throughout the whole journey from Sweden, the pious Kristina has been prejudiced against Ulrika for her past immorality, but they reconcile after Ulrika finds Kristina&#x27;s missing child at a riverboat stop and was almost left behind. Soon after, while still on the riverboat, Danjel&#x27;s infant daughter dies after a brief illness.

After finally arriving at the town of Stillwater, the party, with help from Pastor Jackson, a friendly Baptist minister, finds their way to Anders&#x27; farm in what is now known as the Chisago Lakes area. He lives in a wooden shack, but the land is fertile, and Danjel and Jonas Petter choose fine farmland tracts nearby. Karl Oskar, however, heads deep into the woods to explore the lands along the shore of Lake Ki Chi Saga that he hears are even better. Upon arrival, he finds the topsoil is excellent and stakes a claim by carving his name into a tree overlooking the lake.

===Development===
Plans for adapting &quot;The Emigrants&quot; novels began late in 1967. Its author, Vilhelm Moberg, had seen Jan Troell&#x27;s film &quot;Here Is Your Life&quot; before producer Bengt Forslund approached him about an &quot;Emigrants&quot; film. SF Studios wished to adapt all four novels, although it was uncertain how such a film structure would work.

Moberg requested Forslund and Troell meet him, and the three men mapped out a plot, with 98 scenes, finishing in March 1968. They also envisioned Max von Sydow, Liv Ullmann and Eddie Axberg as the ideal stars. Troell and Forslund went location scouting in the United States in September 1968, but found many of the lands were too developed or could not accommodate film equipment.

===Filming===

The scenes set in Chisago Lakes were actually filmed at Lake Krageholm in Scania, Sweden. Filming took place from June 1969 to January 1970, and then from May to August 1970.

Ullmann said that for &quot;The Emigrants&quot; and &quot;The New Land&quot;, which were shot at the same time, the actors had to learn historic methods of laundry, and also that the brief scene in &quot;The Emigrants&quot; where she is on a swing took two days to film.

The film employed 20 actors and 500 extras. The combined cost of the two films was kr 7 million, making them, at the time, the most expensive Swedish film yet produced.

==Release==
&quot;The Emigrants&quot; was released to cinemas in Sweden on 8 March 1971. It opened in New York City on 24 September 1972. The version released in the U.S. was cut from 190 to 150 minutes by Warner Bros., who distributed the film in America.

In the U.S., the film was not released on home video until February 2016, when The Criterion Collection released it, along with &quot;The New Land&quot;, on DVD and Blu-ray. The films had been frequently requested by customers. In 2016, &quot;The Emigrants&quot; was also featured in the Gothenburg Film Festival.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews.
&quot;The Emigrants&quot; has an approval rating of 94% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 17 reviews, and an average rating of 9/10. 
Roger Ebert gave it four stars, praising it as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, &quot;infinitely absorbing and moving&quot;, and likely more accurate than traditional stories about immigration to the United States. Richard Schickel wrote in &quot;Life&quot; that &quot;Jan Troell has made &quot;the&quot; masterpiece about the dream that shaped America - a dream, and an America, fast disappearing from our views&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed the acting performances, especially from von Sydow and Ullmann, which he found to hold &quot;a kind of spontaneous truth, in look and gesture, that does a lot to relieve the otherwise programed nobility, truth and beauty&quot;. However, Canby criticized Troell for excessive views of &quot;sunlight-reflected-in-water that becomes just one too many, a thing of movie decoration&quot;. In &quot;New York&quot;, Judith Crist praised the film as &quot;exquisite&quot;, and wrote that the depiction of history &quot;throbs with flesh and blood&quot;. In &quot;5001 Nights at the Movies&quot;, Pauline Kael declared the film is &quot;A bursting, resonant work&quot;.

In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, calling it &quot;Solid if rambling&quot;. Dave Kehr recalled it as overrated, calling it &quot;Uncommitted, tedious, and often dishonest&quot;. In 2016, the Swedish journal &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; recalled &quot;The Emigrants&quot; as a classic.

Immigration historian Roger Daniels has called the film &quot;outstanding,&quot; as well as &quot;arguably the finest social history in a commercial movie.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;The Emigrants&quot; was nominated for five Academy Awards, including for both Best Foreign Language Film and Best Picture. However, the Academy&#x27;s rules for eligibility for specific awards meant the nominations occurred in two separate years. It was the third film not in English to be nominated for Best Picture in the history of the Academy.

==Legacy==

The sequel, &quot;The New Land&quot; (&quot;Nybyggarna&quot;), was released in 1972. The 1974 U.S. television series &quot;The New Land&quot; is based loosely on both &quot;The Emigrants&quot; and its sequel. The creation of the TV series can be attributed to the popularity of the films. In Sweden, the musical &quot;Kristina från Duvemåla&quot; by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, formerly of ABBA fame, was designed partly in reaction to Troell&#x27;s films, particularly in differences in the set. Troell also gave his approval to Daniel Espinosa to make a new &quot;Emigrants&quot; film adaptation in 2015, which was ultimately not produced. In 2021, an adaptation based on the book series was released, directed by Erik Poppe.

The two films were considered to give Jan Troell his &quot;international breakthrough&quot;. They led to his receiving, and accepting, an offer from Warner Bros. to make &quot;Zandy&#x27;s Bride&quot;, one of the first times a prominent Swedish director moved to Hollywood since the 1920s.

<doc id="101907" wikidata="Q1622883" url="?curid=101907" title="A Touch of Class (film)">
<text>A Touch of Class is a 1973 British romantic comedy film produced and directed by Melvin Frank and starring George Segal, Glenda Jackson, Hildegard Neil, Paul Sorvino and K Callan. The film tells the story of a couple (Segal and Jackson) having an affair, who find themselves falling in love. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with Jackson winning Best Actress.

The film was adapted by Melvin Frank and Jack Rose from Frank&#x27;s story &quot;She Loves Me, She Told Me So Last Night&quot; (which also became the name of an original song briefly sung in the film by Segal and Jackson). However, it bears more than a passing resemblance to an earlier Frank film, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (1960), which likewise dealt with a middle-aged couple trying to have an affair, centering on a disaster-laden trip to a place where they would not be recognized.

The lead role of Steve was originally offered to Cary Grant, with a promise by Frank to rewrite the script to play up the age difference between Steve and Vickie. However, Grant opted to remain in retirement from filmmaking, and he turned the role down. Despite this, he did remain connected to the film, as it was produced by Fabergé&#x27;s Brut Productions, and Grant was on the board of directors for Fabergé. Roger Moore was also offered the lead role before dropping out to star in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, his first appearance as James Bond. Moore did, however, have a hand in the production of this film.

Glenda Jackson revealed that she was approached by the director Melvin Frank after appearing on the comedy sketch and variety program &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot; on the BBC in the United Kingdom in 1971, in the &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; sketch. After her role in this film won her an Oscar, Eric Morecambe sent her a telegram reading, &quot;Stick with us and we will get you another one&quot;.

==Plot==
Vickie Allessio, a divorced British mother of two, meets Steve Blackburn, an American married man, while sharing a taxi in London. Steve is attracted to Vickie and invites her to tea, then lunch, and eventually suggests they have sex. Vickie agrees but expresses her desire to have uncomplicated sex in a sunny location. Steve arranges a trip to Málaga, Spain.

Their plans are disrupted when Steve&#x27;s wife, Gloria, unexpectedly shows up. To hide their affair, Steve pretends that Vickie is his mother. He cancels the plane tickets he had arranged for his family and encounters his friend Walter Menkes, a movie producer, at the airport. Steve, unable to admit that he is with Vickie, spends the flight next to Walter while Vickie sits elsewhere.

Upon arriving in Málaga, Steve gives the last decent rental car to Walter to get rid of him. He ends up driving an Italian car with an awkward clutch, causing discomfort and annoyance to Vickie. They struggle up several flights of stairs to reach their hotel room.

Their first night together becomes awkward as they argue about their preferences during sex. Steve injures his back, requiring medical attention and sleep. In the morning, Vickie encounters an American woman named Patty but declines her invitation to dinner. Steve wakes up to find Vickie sunbathing on the balcony and they finally have sex.

Steve becomes disappointed when Vickie does not show enthusiasm afterward, leading to anger and tension between them. During a golf game, Vickie takes offense at Steve&#x27;s competitive nature against a local boy. The tension continues to mount, and Vickie decides to have dinner with Patty while Steve arranges dinner with Walter. To their surprise, Vickie discovers that Patty is Walter&#x27;s wife, leading to an uncomfortable dinner for the four of them.

After an argument in their hotel room, Steve and Vickie decide to return to London. At the airport, they realize that the last two plane tickets have been sold. Frustrated, they return to the hotel room and start attacking each other playfully. The situation turns humorous, and their relationship begins to blossom.

Walter and Patty notice the developing relationship between Steve and Vickie. Walter shares his own experience of a holiday romance and warns Steve that it won&#x27;t work out. Despite this, Steve expresses his desire to continue seeing Vickie when they return to London. They rent a secret flat together, concealing their affair.

As their relationship progresses, it becomes more complicated. Vickie puts in a lot of effort to be with Steve, but he often disappoints her. Steve rushes off after sex without realizing that Vickie has prepared a lavish meal for him. Vickie tries to seek companionship with her gay coworker, but he is unavailable. Steve feels guilty and brings flowers to Vickie, only to leave without saying a word.

The tension between them grows, and Steve&#x27;s coworkers become aware of something going on. Steve tries to meet Vickie in the evening but forgets that he has plans with his wife. When his wife calls, Steve is unable to reach Vickie, and Vickie sees Steve and Gloria together at the theater. She feels betrayed and confronts Steve when he finally arrives at their flat.

The next morning, Steve sends a telegram to end their relationship but changes his mind and rushes to the flat; but Vickie has already received the telegram and begins packing to leave. As Steve arrives, he sees Vickie standing at a bus stop. Despite his efforts to get her attention, Vickie leaves in a taxi that another man had hailed. She asks the man if he is married, and upon his affirmative response, she walks away, leaving the taxi for him.

The story concludes with Vickie moving on from the failed affair and finding a new direction in her life.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;a sharp-edged, often very funny dissection of a love affair between two possibly incompatible people. But then it gets serious with itself and ends on a note that doesn&#x27;t satisfy us.&quot; Gene Siskel had a similar opinion, awarding two-and-a-half stars out of four and writing that in the film&#x27;s best moments it &quot;reminds one of those wonderful screen battles between Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn,&quot; but then it &quot;tries to get serious&quot; which &quot;leads to an unsatisfying conclusion totally removed from the dominant tone of the movie, which is raucous at best, contrived silliness at worst.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a very patchy movie—enormously funny in bits and pieces and sometimes downright dumb.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;George Segal herein justifies superbly a reputation for comedy ability while Glenda Jackson&#x27;s full-spectrum talent is again confirmed.&quot; Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the film had &quot;moments of reckless funniness&quot; but observed that the &quot;muddle of period convention is odd,&quot; as it blended the &quot;Hepburn-Tracy tradition&quot; and an &quot;old-style slapstick&quot; scene with &quot;modern and naturalistic eroticism.&quot; Sylvia Millar of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called the film &quot;a waste of two considerable talents,&quot; stating that &quot;Frank has written a script which is not devoid of wit; but it&#x27;s never effortless, and a battering of coarse sexual polemic is always thrusting in to spoil the fun.&quot;

The film has a score of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews, with an average grade of 6.8 out of 10.

===Awards and honours===
==Home media==
&quot;A Touch of Class&quot; was released on DVD in North America by Warner Bros. on February 2, 2002, and on Blu-ray by the Warner Archive Collection on September 10, 2019.

<text>The Towering Inferno is a 1974 American disaster film directed by John Guillermin and produced by Irwin Allen, featuring an ensemble cast led by Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. It was adapted by Stirling Silliphant from the novels &quot;The Tower&quot; by Richard Martin Stern and &quot;The Glass Inferno&quot; by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. In addition to McQueen and Newman, the cast includes William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain, O. J. Simpson, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner, Susan Flannery, Gregory Sierra, Dabney Coleman and Jennifer Jones in her final role.

&quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; was released theatrically December 16, 1974. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and earned around $203.3 million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1974. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning three: Best Song, Best Cinematography and Best Editing.

==Plot==
Architect Doug Roberts returns to San Francisco for the dedication of The Glass Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper that he designed for developer James Duncan. The tower, tall and 138 stories, is the world&#x27;s tallest building. During testing, an electrical short-circuit starts a fire on the 81st floor after another short occurs in the main utility room. While examining the latter short, Roberts sees the wiring is inadequate and suspects that Roger Simmons, the electrical subcontractor and Duncan&#x27;s son-in-law, cut corners. Roberts confronts Simmons, who feigns innocence.

During the dedication ceremony, chief of public relations Dan Bigelow turns on all the tower&#x27;s lights, but Roberts orders them shut off to reduce the load on the electrical system. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor, and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to that floor, where Giddings is fatally burned pushing a guard away from the fire. With the dedication party now in full swing in the tower&#x27;s Promenade Room on the 135th floor, Roberts reports the fire to Duncan, who is courting Senator Gary Parker for an urban renewal contract and refuses to order an evacuation.

SFFD Chief Michael O&#x27;Hallorhan forces Duncan to evacuate the guests from the Promenade Room. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to bring the project back under budget, and suggests other subcontractors did likewise. Fire overtakes the express elevators, killing a group whose elevator stops on the engulfed 81st floor. Bigelow and his girlfriend Lorrie are killed when another fire traps them in the Duncan Enterprises offices on the 65th floor. Lisolette Mueller, a guest and resident of the tower being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a deaf mother and her two children. Security chief Jernigan rescues the mother, but a ruptured gas line explodes, destroying the stairwell and preventing Roberts and the rest from following. They traverse the wreckage of the stairwell to reach a service elevator that takes them to the 134th floor, but the door to the Promenade Room is blocked with hardened cement. Roberts uses a ventilation shaft to reach the room, while Lisolette and the children stay behind.

As firefighters begin to bring the fire under control on floor 65, the electrical system fails, deactivating the passenger elevators; O&#x27;Hallorhan abseils down the elevator shaft to safety. As firemen ascend to free the blocked door at the Promenade Room, another explosion destroys part of the remaining stairwell, blocking the last means of escape from the upper floors. After the stuck door is freed, reuniting Lisolette and the children with Roberts and the others, Simmons tries to escape down the stairwell, but is blocked by flames and retreats. Meanwhile, Claiborne reveals his true identity and intentions to Lisolette, who says she does not care and still wants to be with him.

An attempt at a helicopter rescue fails when two women run up to the aircraft; the pilot tries to evade them and crashes, setting the roof ablaze. A Navy rescue team attaches a breeches buoy between the Promenade Room and the roof of the adjacent 102-story Peerless Building, and rescues guests, including Patty Simmons, Duncan&#x27;s daughter. Roberts rigs a &quot;gravity brake&quot; (fall arrest) on the scenic elevator, allowing one trip down for 12 people, including Roberts&#x27; fiancée Susan Franklin, Lisolette, and the children. An explosion near the 110th floor throws Lisolette from the elevator to her death, and leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable. O&#x27;Hallorhan rescues the elevator with a Navy helicopter.
As fire reaches the Promenade Room, a group led by Simmons attempts to commandeer the breeches buoy, which is destroyed in an explosion, killing Simmons, Senator Parker and others. In a last-ditch strategy, O&#x27;Hallorhan and Roberts blow up water tanks atop the Tower with plastic explosives. Most of the remaining partygoers survive as water rushes through the building, extinguishing the flames.

Claiborne, in shock upon hearing of Lisolette&#x27;s death, is given her cat by Jernigan. Duncan consoles his grieving daughter, and promises such a disaster will never happen again. Roberts accepts O&#x27;Hallorhan&#x27;s offer of guidance on how to build a fire-safe skyscraper. O&#x27;Hallorhan drives away, exhausted.

==Production==
===Development===
In April 1973, it was announced that Warner Bros. production chief John Calley paid $350,000 for the rights to Richard Martin Stern&#x27;s &quot;The Tower&quot;, prior to that book&#x27;s publication. This amount was larger than originally reported. The book had been the subject of a bidding war between Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures; Columbia dropped out when the price reached $200,000 and Warner Bros. offered $390,000. Irwin Allen, who recently had a big success with a disaster movie, &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, was at Fox, and persuaded that studio to make a higher offer when the book was sold to Warner Bros.

Eight weeks later, Fox was submitted a novel, Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Inferno&quot;, which was published the following year, and which Allen says had &quot;the same sort of characters, the same locale, the same story, the same conclusion&quot;. They bought the novel for a reported fee of $400,000.

Allen was concerned that two films about a tall building on fire might cannibalize each other, remembering what happened in the 1960s when rival biopics about Oscar Wilde (with &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; and &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; in 1960) and Jean Harlow (with Magna Media Distribution&#x27;s &quot;Harlow&quot; and Paramount Pictures&#x27;s &quot;Harlow&quot; in 1965) were released. He convinced executives at both studios to join forces to make a single film on the subject. The studios issued a joint press release announcing the single film collaboration in October 1973. Stirling Silliphant, who had written &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, would write the script and Allen would produce. It was decided to split costs equally between the studios, but the film would be made at Fox, where Allen was based. Fox would distribute in the United States and Canada, and Warner Bros. outside those territories. Warner Bros. also handled the worldwide television distribution rights. Incidents and character names were taken from both novels.

The total cost for the film was US$14,300,000.

===Casting===
Several actors who appeared in small roles, including John Crawford, Erik Nelson, Elizabeth Rogers, Ernie Orsatti and Sheila Matthews (Allen&#x27;s wife) had previously appeared in &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, which Allen also produced. Additionally, Paul Newman&#x27;s son, Scott, played the acrophobic fireman afraid to rappel down the elevator shaft.

Lead actors Steve McQueen and Paul Newman were each paid $1million.

Although famed for his dancing and singing in musical movies, Fred Astaire received his only Oscar nomination for this film. He also won both a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for his performance.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place over 14 weeks. Guillermin says that Newman and McQueen were very good to work with, and added considerably to their roles.

===Music===
The score was composed and conducted by John Williams, orchestrated by Herbert W. Spencer and Al Woodbury, and recorded at the 20th Century Fox scoring stage October 31 and November 4, 7 and 11, 1973. The original recording engineer was Ted Keep.

Source music in portions of the film includes instrumental versions of &quot;Again&quot; by Lionel Newman and Dorcas Cochran, &quot;You Make Me Feel So Young&quot; by Josef Myrow and Mack Gordon, and &quot;The More I See You&quot; by Harry Warren and Mack Gordon.

A snippet of a cue from Williams&#x27; score to &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot;, entitled &quot;Maggie Shoots Pool&quot;, is heard in a scene in which William Holden&#x27;s character converses on the phone with Paul Newman&#x27;s character. It is not the recording on the soundtrack album, but a newer arrangement recorded for &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;.

One of the most sought-after unreleased music cues from the film is the one in which Williams provides low-key lounge music during a party prior to the announcement of a fire. O&#x27;Hallorhan orders Duncan to evacuate the party; the music becomes louder as Lisolette and Harlee are seen dancing and Duncan lectures son-in-law Roger. Entitled &quot;The Promenade Room&quot; on the conductor&#x27;s cue sheet, the track features a ragged ending, as Duncan asks the house band to stop playing. Because of this, &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; did not add this cue to the expanded soundtrack album.

The Academy Award-winning song, &quot;We May Never Love Like This Again&quot;, was composed by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn, and performed by Maureen McGovern, who appears in a cameo as a lounge singer, and on the score&#x27;s soundtrack album, which features the film recording, plus the commercially released single version. Additionally, the theme tune is interpolated into the film&#x27;s underscore by Williams. The song&#x27;s writers collaborated on &quot;The Morning After&quot; from &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, an Oscar-winning song that was also recorded by McGovern, although hers was not the vocal used in that film.

The first release of portions of the score from &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; was issued by Warner Bros. Records in early 1975 (Catalog No. BS-2840).

A near-complete release was issued on the Film Score Monthly label April 1, 2001, and was produced by Lukas Kendall and Nick Redman. Film Score Monthly&#x27;s was an almost completely expanded version, remixed from album masters at Warner Bros. archives and the multi-track 35mm magnetic film stems at 20th Century Fox. Placed into chronological order and restoring action cues, it became one of the company&#x27;s biggest sellers; only 4,000 copies were pressed, and it is now out of print.

Reports that this soundtrack and that of the film &quot;Earthquake&quot;, also composed by Williams, borrowed cues from each other are inaccurate. The version of &quot;Main Title&quot; on the Film Score Monthly disc is the film version. It differs from the original soundtrack album version. There is a different balance of instruments in two spots, and in particular, the snare drum is more prominent than the album version, which also features additional cymbal work. Although the album was not a re-recording, the original LP tracks were recorded during the same sessions, and several cues were combined. The film version sound was reportedly better than the quarter-inch Warner Bros. two-track album master. Although some minor incidental cues were lost, some sonically &quot;damaged&quot; cues — so called due to a deterioration of the surviving audio elements — are placed at the end of the disc&#x27;s program time following the track, &quot;An Architect&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which is used over the end credits sequence.

==Release==
&quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; was released in theaters December 14, 1974, in United States and Canada by 20th Century Fox, and internationally by Warner Bros.

===Top billing===
Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and William Holden all wanted top billing. Holden was refused, his long-term standing as a box-office draw having been eclipsed by both McQueen and Newman. To provide dual top billing, the credits were arranged diagonally, with McQueen lower left and Newman upper right. Thus, each appeared to have &quot;first&quot; billing, depending on whether the credit was read left-to-right or top-to-bottom. This was the first time this &quot;staggered but equal&quot; billing was used in a movie, although it had been considered earlier for the same two actors regarding &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, until McQueen turned down the Sundance Kid role. McQueen is mentioned first in the film&#x27;s trailers. In the cast list rolling from top to bottom at the film&#x27;s end, however, McQueen and Newman&#x27;s names were arranged diagonally as at the beginning; as a consequence, Newman&#x27;s name is fully visible first.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences alike on its release. The film has an approval rating of 68% based on 38 reviews with an average rating of 6.70/10 on Rotten Tomatoes. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Although it is not consistently engaging enough to fully justify its towering runtime, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; is a blustery spectacle that executes its disaster premise with flair.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 69 based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, and praised it as &quot;the best of the mid-1970s wave of disaster films&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; praised the film as &quot;one of the greatest disaster pictures made, a personal and professional triumph for producer Irwin Allen. The $14 million cost has yielded a truly magnificent production which complements but does not at all overwhelm a thoughtful personal drama.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film is &quot;overwrought and silly in its personal drama, but the visual spectacle is first rate. You may not come out of the theater with any important ideas about American architecture or enterprise, but you will have had a vivid, completely safe nightmare.&quot;

Pauline Kael, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, panned the writing and characters as retreads from &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, and further wrote, &quot;What was left out this time was the hokey fun. When a picture has any kind of entertainment in it, viewers don&#x27;t much care about credibility, but when it isn&#x27;t entertaining we do. And when a turkey bores us and insults our intelligence for close to three hours, it shouldn&#x27;t preen itself on its own morality.&quot;

Gene Siskel of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it &quot;a stunt and not a story. It&#x27;s a technical achievement more concerned with special effects than with people. That&#x27;s why our attitude toward the film&#x27;s cardboard characters is: let &#x27;em burn.&quot;

&quot;FilmInk&quot; called it &quot;brilliant fun&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was one of the biggest-grossing films of 1975, with theatrical rentals of $48,838,000 in the United States and Canada. In January 1976, it was claimed that the film had attained the highest foreign film rental for any film in its initial release, with $43 million, and went on to earn $56 million. When combined with the rentals from the United States and Canada, the worldwide rental is $104,838,000.

The film grossed $116 million in the United States and Canada and $203 million worldwide.
