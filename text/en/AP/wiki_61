<text>The Jervis Bay Territory (; &quot;JBT&quot;) is an internal Australian territory. It was established in 1915 by the transfer of jurisdiction from the state of New South Wales to the federal Commonwealth of Australia, in order to give the federal government control of a port in the vicinity of the landlocked Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

== History ==
Aboriginal Australian people long lived over the area of Jervis Bay. The area underwent significant change 18,000 to 7,500 years ago when the sea level rose, displacing inhabitants of previously coastal areas, resulting in dramatic population redistribution. The Yuin people have a continuing connection to the Jervis Bay area and in December 2016, applied for recognition of their native title.

Jervis Bay was sighted by Lieutenant James Cook aboard on 25 April, 1770 (two days after Saint George&#x27;s Day) and he named the southern headland Cape St George. In August 1791, the British convict transport ship &quot;Atlantic&quot; of the Third Fleet entered the bay and Lieutenant Richard Bowen named it in honour of Admiral John Jervis. In November 1791, the , under Master Matthew Weatherhead, entered the bay to undertake repairs.
Survivors of the &quot;Sydney Cove&quot; shipwreck in 1797 reached the area by foot, heading to Port Jackson. Explorer George Bass entered the bay on 10 December, 1797. He named Bowen Island.
John Oxley, an English explorer and surveyor, travelled from Sydney by sea to explore the bay in 1819.
Negotiations for the Federation of Australia reached three major agreements for proposed federal territories.
* First, a federal capital, a new, purpose-built city, should be located within the borders of New South Wales (NSW).
* Second, to help ensure such location did not give NSW too much influence on federal politics, that the new city and surrounds would be exclaved from NSW, as a separate federal territory.
* Third, that the federal government should have direct control and jurisdiction over at least one port. 

The site of the capital city was not decided until 1908. All of the seriously considered sites were substantial distances inland. Therefore, the capital and the port would be separate. Ownership of Crown land in the Jervis Bay area was transferred from the NSW government to the federal government in 1909 (at the same time that ownership of the site of Canberra and the surrounding area was also relinquished by NSW). In 1915, jurisdiction over the Jervis Bay Territory was transferred from the state of New South Wales to the federal Commonwealth of Australia. To reduce the practical difficulties presented by the physical separation of the two territories, but this was never implemented.

The territory has been administered by various federal government’s departments over the years, in turn:
* Department of the Interior
* Department of the Capital Territory) 
* Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (1989-91)
* Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (1991-93)
* Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories (1993-96)
* Department of Transport and Regional Development (1996-98)
* Department of Transport and Regional Development (1998-2007) 
* Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (2007-10)
* Department of Infrastructure and Transport (2010-13)
* Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development (2013-17)
* Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities (2017-2019)
* Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development (2019-20)
* Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications (2020-22)
* Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (since 2022).

=== Proposed nuclear reactor ===
In 1969, Jervis Bay Territory was proposed as the site for a nuclear power plant but the proposal was cancelled in 1971. An access road had been constructed to the site, on the southeast corner of the bay near Murray&#x27;s Beach and the site excavated and levelled. The levelled site is now the car park for Murrays Beach and its adjacent boat ramp.

== Geography ==

Having of land and marine reserve, Jervis Bay Territory is the smallest of all the mainland states and territories of Australia. Jervis Bay is a natural harbour north to south and east to west, opening to the east onto the Pacific Ocean. The bay is situated on the southern coast of New South Wales about south of Sydney. The nearest major town is Nowra, about north, on the Shoalhaven River.

The majority of Jervis Bay embayment is part of Jervis Bay Marine Park (NSW State) while the waters within Jervis Bay Territory are part of Booderee National Park, formerly Jervis Bay National Park, (Commonwealth). Booderee means &#x27;bay of plenty&#x27; or &#x27;plenty of fish&#x27; in the local Aboriginal language. The park itself encompasses approximately 90% of the territory of Jervis Bay and covers the overlap between Australia&#x27;s northern and southern climatic zones. There are three small lakes within the territory: Lake Windermere, the largest, with an area of ; Lake Mckenzie, ; as well as Blacks Waterhole measuring . Ancient sand dunes overlay the sedimentary bedrock formations formed from upheaval of the surrounding marine environment 280–225 million years ago. Bowen Island, at the entrance to the bay north of Governors Head, is in area. It has rookeries for the little penguin &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot;.

A wide variety of flora and fauna are native to the territory, with approximately 206 species of birds, 27 species of mammals, 15 species of amphibians, 23 species of reptiles and 180 species of fish native to the area. 

===Demographics and settlements===
At the , 310 people lived in the territory, the majority working and living at the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) base, HMAS &quot;Creswell&quot;. Vincentia in NSW is the nearest town, roughly north of the border. All of Jervis Bay is covered within the postcode 2540.

The Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council owns approximately , about 90% of the territory and exercises certain governance and representation functions for its community under the &quot;Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986&quot; The rest is managed by the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities.

There are two villages in the Jervis Bay Territory:
* Jervis Bay Village (population 128)
* Wreck Bay Village (population 152) is an Aboriginal community. 

==== HMAS &quot;Creswell&quot; ====
HMAS Creswell is the Royal Australian Navy College and associated naval facilities. The adjacent Jervis Bay Airfield is operated by the RAN. 

====Christian&#x27;s Minde====
There are several private leasehold properties in the Jervis Bay Territory within but not part of Booderee National Park. A group of buildings on the eastern foreshore of Sussex Inlet, known as the Christian&#x27;s Minde Settlement, comprises of six separate parcels of land, four of which are leaseholds. The historical, heritage-listed Christian&#x27;s Minde (Block 14) was founded in the mid-1880s by the Ellmoos family from Denmark. Christian&#x27;s Minde was promoted as the first guesthouse on the NSW south coast between Port Hacking and Twofold Bay when it was established in the 1890s. Pamir (Block 12) is also part of Christian&#x27;s Minde Settlement. Descendants of the Ellmoos family lived at Christian&#x27;s Minde (Block 14), Ellmoos (Block 9) and Ardath (Block 11) for over 130 years, and continue to live at Kullindi (Block 10) today. Members of the extended family are buried in a cemetery, surrounded by dense bush, which is managed by the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council.

Other leaseholds in Jervis Bay Territory are the Railway, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) Holiday Park (Block 37) and The Cove (former Bay of Plenty Lodges) (Block 28).

== Administration ==

Jervis Bay Territory voters are represented in the Senate together with those of the ACT and it forms part of the Division of Fenner (also with the ACT) for House of Representatives purposes but it is not part of the ACT.

For most purposes, the territory is governed by the laws of the Australian Capital Territory which, by the terms of the &quot;Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915&quot;, apply to the Jervis Bay Territory. Residents have access to the ACT and federal court systems.

Jervis Bay Territory is administered by the Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts. Its Jervis Bay Administration handles matters normally handled by state or local government. Australian Federal Police provide policing. The Commonwealth government contracts the ACT government to provide various services like courts, education and welfare, the Government of New South Wales for rural fire services and community health, Shoalhaven City Council for waste collection and library services, and commercial providers for electricity and water supplies. 

Jervis Bay Territory does not have its own elected local council. Although they are subject to ACT law and some services are contracted by the Commonwealth government to nearby councils in New South Wales, Jervis Bay Territory residents do not vote in either ACT or New South Wales elections. Aboriginal persons who are registered members of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council have voting rights in the council&#x27;s meetings and elect the council&#x27;s executive.

Section 61 of the &quot;Defence Force Discipline Act&quot; (DFDA) makes all Australian defence force members and &quot;Defence Civilians&quot; subject to the criminal laws of the Jervis Bay Territory regardless of where the offence occurred. This is a legal mechanism that makes defence personnel subject to the &quot;Crimes Act 1914&quot; (Cth), the &quot;Criminal Code Act 1995&quot; (Cth) and offences against the criminal law of the ACT, as military law, even if the offence is committed elsewhere outside Australia.

<text>Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1999 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous United States editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a British reference book published annually, listing world records both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. Sir Hugh Beaver created the concept, and twin brothers Norris and Ross McWhirter co-founded the book in London in August 1955.

The first edition topped the bestseller list in the United Kingdom by Christmas 1955. The following year the book was launched internationally, and as of the 2025 edition, it is now in its 70th year of publication, published in 100 countries and 40 languages, and maintains over 53,000 records in its database.

The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; becoming the primary international source for cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records. The organisation employs record adjudicators to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.

Following a series of owners, the franchise has been owned by the Jim Pattison Group since 2008, with its headquarters moved to South Quay Plaza, Canary Wharf, London, in 2017. Since 2008, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; has orientated its business model away from selling books, and towards creating new world records as publicity exercises for individuals and organisations, which has attracted criticism.

==History==
On 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries, went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse (the plover is faster, but neither is the fastest game bird in Europe). That evening at Castlebridge House, he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe&#x27;s fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must have been numerous other questions debated nightly among the public, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful. Beaver&#x27;s idea became reality when Guinness employee Christopher Chataway recommended university friends Norris and Ross McWhirter, who had been running a fact-finding agency in London. The twin brothers were commissioned to compile what became &quot;The Guinness Book of (Superlatives and now) Records,&quot; in August 1954. A thousand copies were distributed for free to pubs across Britain and Ireland as a promotional asset for the Guinness brand, and they became immensely popular with customers.

After the founding of &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; office at the top of Ludgate House, 107 Fleet Street, London, the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British bestseller list by Christmas. The following year, it was introduced into the United States by New York publisher David Boehm and sold 70,000 copies. Since then, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; has sold more than 150 million copies in 100 countries and 40 languages.
Because the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the British children&#x27;s television series &quot;Record Breakers&quot;, based upon the book, which was broadcast on the BBC from 1972 to 2001, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. Ross McWhirter was assassinated by two members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1975, in response to offering a £50,000 reward for information that would lead to capture of members of the organisation. Following Ross&#x27;s assassination, the feature in the show where questions about records posed by children were answered was called &quot;Norris on the Spot&quot;. Norris carried on as the book&#x27;s sole editor.

Guinness Superlatives, later Guinness World Records Limited, was incorporated in London in 1954 to publish the first book. Sterling Publishing owned the rights to the &quot;Guinness&quot; book in the US for decades until it was repurchased by Guinness in 1989 after an 18-month long lawsuit. The group was owned by Guinness PLC and subsequently Diageo until 2001, when it was purchased by Gullane Entertainment for £45.5 million ($65 million). Gullane was itself purchased by HIT Entertainment in 2002. In 2006, Apax Partners purchased HIT and subsequently sold Guinness World Records in early 2008 to the Jim Pattison Group, the parent company of Ripley Entertainment, which is licensed to operate Guinness World Records&#x27; Attractions. With offices in New York City and Tokyo, Guinness World Records&#x27; global headquarters remain in London, specifically South Quay Plaza, Canary Wharf, while its museum attractions are based at Ripley headquarters in Orlando, Florida.

===Evolution===

Recent editions have focused on record feats by individuals. Competitions range from obvious ones such as Olympic weightlifting to the longest egg tossing distances, or for longest time spent playing &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; or the largest number of hot dogs consumed in three minutes. Besides records about competitions, it contains such facts such as the heaviest tumour, the most poisonous fungus, the longest-running soap opera and the most valuable life-insurance policy, among others. Many records also relate to the youngest people to have achieved something, such as the youngest person to visit all nations of the world, currently held by Maurizio Giuliano.

Each edition contains a selection of the records from the Guinness World Records database, as well as select new records, with the criteria for inclusion changing from year to year. The latest edition is the 70th, published on 15 September 2023. It is the fourth and last installment featuring Rod Hunt&#x27;s illustrations on the cover with the topic of &#x27;The ocean and the water&#x27;.

The retirement of Norris McWhirter from his consulting role in 1995 and the subsequent decision by Diageo Plc to sell &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; brand have shifted the focus of the books from text-oriented to illustrated reference. A selection of records are curated for the book from the full archive but all existing Guinness World Records titles can be accessed by creating a login on the company&#x27;s website. Applications made by individuals for existing record categories are free of charge. There is an administration fee of £5 (or $5) to propose a new record title.
A number of spin-off books and television series have also been produced. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; bestowed the record of &quot;Person with the most records&quot; on Ashrita Furman of Queens, New York, in April 2009; at that time, he held 100 records.

In 2005, Guinness designated 9 November as &quot;International Guinness World Records Day&quot; to encourage breaking of world records. In 2006, an estimated 100,000 people participated in over 10 countries. Guinness reported 2,244 new records in 12 months, which was a 173% increase over the previous year. In February 2008, NBC aired &quot;The Top 100 Guinness World Records of All Time&quot; and Guinness World Records made the complete list available on their website.

The popularity of the franchise has resulted in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records.

===List of discontinued Guinness World Records===
Over its history, numerous world record categories have been discontinued. This list may include that the record poses a threat to health or the environment.
==Defining records==
For many records, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; is the effective authority on the exact requirements for them and with whom records reside, the company providing adjudicators to events to determine the veracity of record attempts. The list of records which the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; covers is not fixed, records may be added and also removed for various reasons. The public is invited to submit applications for records, which can be either the bettering of existing records or substantial achievements which could constitute a new record. The company also provides corporate services for companies to &quot;harness the power of record-breaking to deliver tangible success for their businesses.&quot;

===Ethical and safety issues===

&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; states several types of records it will not accept for ethical reasons, such as those related to the killing or harming of animals. In the 2006 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, Colombian serial killer Pedro López was listed as the &quot;most prolific serial killer&quot;, having murdered at least 110 people (with Lopez himself claiming he murdered over 300 people) in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru in the late 1960s to 1980s. This was removed after complaints that the listing and category made a competition out of murder.

Several world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons, including concerns for the well-being of potential record breakers. For example, following publication of the &quot;heaviest pet&quot; record, many owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy, and therefore such entries were removed. The Guinness Book also dropped records within their &quot;eating and drinking records&quot; section of Human Achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential litigation. These changes included the removal of all spirit, wine and beer drinking records, along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees. Other records, such as sword swallowing and rally driving (on public roads), were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels.
There have been instances of closed categories being reopened. For example, the sword swallowing category was listed as closed in the 1990 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, but has since been reopened with Johnny Strange breaking a sword swallowing record on Guinness World Records Live. Similarly, the speed beer drinking records which were dropped from the book in 1991, reappeared 17 years later in the 2008 edition, but were moved from the &quot;Human Achievements&quot; section of the older book to the &quot;Modern Society&quot; section of the newer edition.

, it is required in the guidelines of all &quot;large food&quot; type records that the item be fully edible, and distributed to the public for consumption, to prevent food wastage. Chain letters are also not allowed: &quot;Guinness World Records does not accept any records relating to chain letters, sent by post or e-mail.&quot; After Roger Guy English set the record for sleeplessness in 1974, the category was discontinued for being too dangerous. At the request of the U.S. Mint, in 1984, the book stopped accepting claims of large hoardings of pennies or other currency. Environmentally unfriendly records (such as the releasing of sky lanterns and party balloons) are no longer accepted or monitored, in addition to records relating to tobacco or cannabis consumption or preparation.

In 2024, Guinness World Records was accused of laundering the reputation of the oppressive governments as it set world records for the UAE&#x27;s police forces and Egypt&#x27;s military. By 2024, the UAE achieved 526 records, of which 21 were credited to the Emirates&#x27; police force. Matthew Hedges, a British academic who was forced to sign a false confession, asked the records body to take down the Abu Dhabi police department&#x27;s certificate for &quot;most signatures on a scroll&quot;, along with other such titles. Concerns were also raised around the activities around Egypt, which moved from 22 records to 110 within a decade until 2024. James Lynch, co-founder of FairSquare, said the records were legitimising Abdel Fattah el-Sisi&#x27;s regime. The Guinness World Records stated that its record titles &quot;cannot be purchased&quot;.

===Difficulty in defining records===
For some potential categories, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; has declined to list some records that are too difficult or impossible to determine. For example, its website states: &quot;We do not accept any claims for beauty as it is not objectively measurable.&quot;

On 10 December 2010, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; stopped accepting submissions for the &quot;dreadlock&quot; category after investigation of its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, determining it was impossible to judge this record accurately.

==Change in business model==
Traditionally, the company made a large amount of its revenue via book sales to interested readers, especially children. The rise of the Internet began to cut into book sales starting in the 2000s, part of a general decline in the book industry. According to a 2017 story by &quot;Planet Money&quot; of NPR, Guinness began to realise that a lucrative new revenue source to replace falling book sales was the would-be record-holders themselves. While any person can theoretically send in a record to be verified for free, the approval process is slow. Would-be record breakers that paid fees ranging from US$12,000 to US$500,000 would be given advisors, adjudicators, help in finding good records to break as well as suggestions for how to do it, prompt service, and so on. In particular, corporations and celebrities seeking a publicity stunt to launch a new product or draw attention to themselves began to hire &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, paying them for finding a record to break or to create a new category just for them. As such, they have been described as a native advertising company, with no clear distinction between content and advertisement.

&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; was criticised by television talk show host John Oliver on the program &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; in August 2019. Oliver criticised Guinness for taking money from authoritarian governments for pointless vanity projects as it related to the main focus of his story, President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. Oliver asked Guinness to work with &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; to adjudicate a record for &quot;Largest cake featuring a picture of someone falling off a horse&quot;, but according to Oliver, the offer did not work out after Guinness insisted on a non-disparagement clause. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; denied the accusations and stated that they declined Oliver&#x27;s offer to participate because &quot;it was merely an opportunity to mock one of our record-holders,&quot; and that Oliver did not specifically request the record for the largest marble cake. As of 2021, the Guinness World Record for &quot;Largest marble cake&quot; remains with Betty Crocker Middle East in Saudi Arabia. Following Oliver&#x27;s episode, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;&#x27; ethics were called into question by human rights groups.

==Museums==

In 1976, a &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; museum opened in the Empire State Building. Speed shooter Bob Munden then went on tour promoting &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot; by performing his record fast draws with a standard weight single-action revolver from a Western movie-type holster. His fastest time for a draw was 0.02 seconds. Among exhibits were life-size statues of the world&#x27;s tallest man, Robert Wadlow, and world&#x27;s largest earthworm, an X-ray photo of a sword swallower, repeated lightning strike victim Roy Sullivan&#x27;s hat complete with lightning holes and a pair of gem-studded golf shoes on sale for $6,500. The museum closed in 1995.

In more recent years, the Guinness company has permitted the franchising of small museums with displays based on the book, all currently () located in towns popular with tourists: Tokyo, Copenhagen, San Antonio.
There were once Guinness World Records museums and exhibitions at the London Trocadero, Bangalore, San Francisco, Myrtle Beach, Orlando, Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Las Vegas, Nevada. The Orlando museum, which closed in 2002, was branded &quot;The Guinness Records Experience&quot;; the Hollywood, Niagara Falls, Copenhagen, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee museums also previously featured this branding.

==Retail and merchandise== 
Guinness World Records operates an official online shop, the Guinness World Records Store, which offers items related to record-breaking achievements, including certificates of participation, apparel, and the annual Guinness World Records book.

The shop provides record-holders and the general public with access to official Guinness World Records materials. Merchandise is part of the organization&#x27;s broader engagement efforts beyond its publications and events.

==Television series==
&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; has commissioned various television series documenting world record breaking attempts, including:

Specials:
* &quot;Guinness World Records: 50 Years, 50 Records&quot; – on ITV (UK), 11 September 2004

==Gamer&#x27;s edition==

In 2008, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; released its gamer&#x27;s edition, a supplement that keeps records for popular video game high scores, codes and feats in association with Twin Galaxies. The Gamer&#x27;s Edition used to contain 258 pages, over 1,236 video game related world records and four interviews including one with Twin Galaxies founder Walter Day. Editions were published for the years 2008 through 2020, with the 2009 edition in hardcover. The 2025 edition is the first since 2020, returning after a five-year hiatus. Since 2020, the supplement had 192 pages. 

==&quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot;==

&quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot; was a music reference book first published in 1977. It was compiled by BBC Radio 1 DJs Paul Gambaccini and Mike Read with brothers Tim Rice and Jonathan Rice. It was the first in a number of music reference books that were to be published by Guinness Publishing with sister publication &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums&quot; coming in 1983. After being sold to Hit Entertainment, the data concerning the Official Chart Company&#x27;s singles and albums charts were combined under the title &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;, with Hit Entertainment publishing the book from 2003 to 2006 (under the Guinness World Records brand). After Guinness World Records was sold to The Jim Pattison Group, it was effectively replaced by a series of books published by Ebury Publishing/Random House with the &quot;Virgin Book of British Hit Singles&quot; first being published in 2007 and with a &quot;Hit Albums&quot; book following two years later.

==Other media and products==
===Board game===
In 1975, Parker Brothers marketed a board game, &quot;The Guinness Game of World Records&quot;, based on the book. Players compete by setting and breaking records for activities such as the longest streak of rolling dice before rolling doubles, stacking plastic pieces, and bouncing a ball off alternating sides of a card, as well as answering trivia questions based on the listings in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

===Video games===
A video game, &quot;Guinness World Records: The Videogame&quot;, was developed by TT Fusion and released for Nintendo DS, Wii and iOS in November 2008.

===Film===
In 2012, Warner Bros. announced the development of a live-action film version of &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; with Daniel Chun as scriptwriter. The film version will apparently use the heroic achievements of record holders as the basis for a narrative that should have global appeal.

<text>Eufaula is the largest city in Barbour County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census the city&#x27;s population was 13,137.

==History==

The site along the Chattahoochee River that is now modern-day Eufaula was occupied by three Muscogee Creek tribes, including the Eufaulas. By the 1820s the land was part of the Creek Indian Territory and supposedly off-limits to white settlement. By 1827 enough illegal white settlement had occurred that the Creeks appealed to the federal government for protection of their property rights. In July of that year, federal troops were sent to the Eufaula area to remove the settlers by force of arms, a conflict known as the &quot;Intruders War&quot;.

The Creeks signed the Treaty of Washington in 1826, ceding most of their land in Georgia and eastern Alabama to the United States, but it was not fully effective in practice until the late 1820s. The 1832 Treaty of Cusseta, by which the Creeks ceded all land east of the Mississippi River to the United States, allowed white settlers to legally buy land from the Creek. However, the treaty&#x27;s terms did not require any natives to relocate. By 1835 the land on which the town was built had been mostly purchased by white settlers, and had a store, owned in part by William Irwin, after whom the new settlement was named &quot;Irwinton&quot;.

By the mid 1830s downtown Irwinton was platted out and development was well underway. Much of its historic character has been preserved and is now known as the Seth Lore and Irwinton Historic District. In 1842 or 1843 Irwinton was renamed &quot;Eufaula&quot;, possibly to end postal confusion ensuing from its proximity to Irwinton, Georgia. The town was officially incorporated under that name in 1857.

In 1850 secessionists in the town formed a vigilante committee which terrorized any white people who had abolitionist sympathies. Thus captain Elisha Bett was driven from the town and only returned after he had signed a written agreement not to express his views again.

Significant numbers of Jewish settlers came to Eufaula in the middle of the nineteenth century from Germany and from neighboring states. The community founded a cemetery; the first burial took place in 1845.

By the late 1850s, Eufaula&#x27;s advantageous location on the Chattahoochee made it a major shipping center for cargo bound for the Port of Apalachicola and, from there, to major world markets such as Liverpool and New York City. By this time, planning for the Montgomery and Eufaula Railroad, which was to include a new bridge over the Chattahoochee, was well underway. By November 1859 the railroad company authorized its president to purchase slaves worth $150,000 to use for the construction of the railroad. Grading for the track bed began in January 1860. By 1861, when it had become clear that the American Civil War was imminent, work on the railroad was suspended to allow the laborers to lay track between Montgomery, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, to facilitate the transport of Confederate troops to the Gulf of Mexico. Work on the railroad was resumed after the war, and, in October 1871, the tracks finally reached the city limits of Eufaula and a depot agent, John O. Martin, was appointed to run that terminal station.

===The Civil War in Eufaula===
Very little is known about the history of Eufaula during the American Civil War because very few contemporary records or newspapers survive. Alabama seceded from the United States on January 11, 1861. By the end of the month a military encampment was founded at Eufaula with soldiers ready to decamp to Fort Pickens or elsewhere as needed at the onset of hostilities. Ultimately six companies of the Confederate States Army (CSA) were raised at Eufaula and Barbour County. One of these was the Eufaula Zouaves, one of dozens of military units on both sides that adopted that name, patterning their uniforms and order of battle after the French light infantry units on which they were modeled.

The CSA operated a military hospital in Eufaula during the conflict. Eufaula&#x27;s strategic position on the Chattahoochee river involved it in the naval component of the Confederate war effort, and at least one ironclad warship was constructed in the city. By April 1865, the Union Army had occupied Selma, Alabama, and plans were made to move the Alabama state government to Eufaula should Montgomery fall to Federal troops.

Montgomery was captured on April 12 and governor Thomas H. Watts, with other state officials, fled to Eufaula, establishing what the &quot;New York Daily Tribune&quot; called &quot;the fugitive seat of Government of Alabama&quot;. On April 29, 1865, Union general Benjamin Grierson had reached Clayton, Alabama, and word had finally made it to Eufaula that the war was over. The mayor of Eufaula and some members of the city council rode over to Clayton to escort Grierson into Eufaula, thus ensuring a generally peaceful transition to Federal control of the city.

Eufaula was the site of what may have been the last battle of the Civil War. On May 19, 1865, at Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge near Eufaula a Confederate detachment attacked a 44-man detachment from companies C and F of the Union&#x27;s 1st Florida Cavalry Regiment, resulting in one soldier killed and three wounded.

By May 1865 the &quot;Daily Intelligencer&quot; of Atlanta reported that 10,000 Union troops had occupied Eufaula. In the immediate aftermath of the occupation there was a food riot and an &quot;attempt to illegally distribute the public stores&quot;. By the end of May Eufaula was sufficiently pacified that a special agent of the United States Post Office was able to deliver mail from Providence, Rhode Island, to the town via Macon, Georgia, without need for any of the twenty-five armed guards he had brought with him to defend him with violence.

===Reconstruction in Eufaula===
By August 1865 cotton shipping out of Eufaula was increasing again, mostly in barter for household goods, which were arriving by ship in increasing quantities. However, the quantity of cotton being shipped out was nowhere near antebellum levels, and ships bound for Apalachicola were far below capacity. In November 1865 the Federal garrison that had been occupying Eufaula was relieved of duty by two companies of the 8th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment, whose commander, John Bell, assured the citizens that they would not &quot;be disturbed in their lawful business.&quot;

In March 1867, the United States Congress passed the first of four Reconstruction Acts and the Reconstruction Era began in earnest. Alabama, and therefore Eufaula, was placed in the Third Military District under the command of General John Pope. By the time the first elections were held under the new regime, in October 1867, Barbour County had about 5,000 registered voters, with about 1,500 white and 3,500 black.

Municipal elections were held in March 1870 and white candidates won all offices except for the two fourth (of four) ward positions as aldermen, which were won by black candidates Washington Burke and Melvin Patterson. Election officials set aside Burke&#x27;s and Patterson&#x27;s victories for election fraud and replaced them with their white competitors R. A. Solo and T. E. Morgan as fourth ward aldermen. In the same election a radical republican candidate named Keills won the post of City Court Judge. According to the &quot;Mobile Register&quot;, Keills&#x27;s &quot;election turned upon sectional differences. The negroes made their usual noisy demonstrations, marching in from the country with fife and drum.&quot;

On November 3, 1874, members of the White League instigated the Election Riot of 1874 in Eufaula on election day, massacring at least 7 black Republicans, shooting at least 70 more, and preventing over 1,000 others from voting. They hijacked the vote count, fraudulently electing white candidates by excluding votes cast by blacks. Federal officials attempted to hold the white mob members accountable, but police falsely charged and convicted a witness with perjury, intimidating other witnesses. By 1876, with Reconstruction ended and black voters intimidated with lynching, there were just 10 black voters in the city, compared to 1,200 in February 1874.

By 1866 there was a general movement of black Baptists to separate from the white churches and form their own congregations. Black Baptists applied for permission to separate in May 1866. The permission was granted, and, after negotiations, the black Baptists were allowed to purchase an old church building to house their own congregation. This congregation formed the basis of the Eufaula Association, one of two black Baptist associations formed in Alabama prior to the founding of the state association of black Baptist churches in 1868. By 1869 the site for the new white First Baptist Church of Eufaula had been purchased and $16,000 out of an estimated $25,000 necessary for its construction had been raised.

===Civil rights movement===

====Eufaula housing case====
For a number of years after the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 decision &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which overturned &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; by declaring racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, the schools in Eufaula remained unintegrated. In 1955 the Eufaula Housing Authority sought to use eminent domain to condemn land on which a number of black families had lived since emancipation in order to build public housing, a park, and an expansion of the white high school. The residents of the neighborhood, surrounded on all sides by white areas, thought that the city&#x27;s motive was actually to keep their children out of a newly built high school once the now-inevitable racial integration occurred.

In 1958 civil rights attorneys Fred Gray and Constance Baker Motley filed a suit in the U.S. District court claiming that their clients&#x27; constitutional rights were being violated by the plan. The federal case was dismissed, but Gray (now appearing without Motley) appealed to the Alabama Circuit Court, where the case was heard by then-judge George Wallace. As before, Gray claimed that since the new development would allow white residents only, their civil rights were being violated by the City. Although his appeal of the constitutional issue was unsuccessful, Gray also appealed the city&#x27;s valuations of his clients&#x27; properties and, arguing before all-white juries in Wallace&#x27;s court, managed in most of the cases to win much higher prices.

====Voting Rights Act of 1965====
After the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the United States Department of Justice sent federal observers into 24 southern counties to enforce its provisions regarding voter registration for the Fall 1965 elections. Many of these counties saw a significant increase in black registration, but Eufaula, not having federal supervision, had comparatively low rates. For instance, on August 16, 1965, 600 black citizens waited in line at the County courthouse in Eufaula to register, but by the time the office closed, only 265 had managed to fill out the paperwork.

In 1966 the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) responded by appointing a local Eufaulan, Daddy Bone, to organize voter registration drives in Eufaula. Bone initiated a series of nonviolent protests and boycotts of local stores that refused to hire blacks which attracted SNCC supporters from around the Southeastern United States. The city of Eufaula, under some pressure from the businessmen whose stores were targeted, passed anti-picketing laws and began arresting demonstrators &quot;en masse&quot; for violating them. Bone brought in civil rights lawyer S. S. Seay to defend the protestors, who were mostly convicted, and in such numbers as to overwhelm the county jail.

====School integration====

In July 1968 the United States Department of Justice filed suit against 76 Alabama school districts, including that of Eufaula, in an attempt to bring them into compliance with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

Schools in Eufaula remained segregated by race until the fall of 1966 and the first blacks graduated with the senior class of 1967. After integration began the school stopped sponsoring social events, such as proms although unofficial segregated events were still held. By 1990, students at Eufaula High School had begun pressuring school officials to allow them to hold integrated proms, and the first such was held in 1991 without incident.

===Other recent history===

In 1963, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created Walter F. George Lake (unofficially named Lake Eufaula) behind the lock and dam of Fort Gaines, Georgia, once again assuring Eufaula&#x27;s importance as an inland port.

In the early 1960s, the United States Coast Guard set up an Aids to Navigation Team in Eufaula that is still active today servicing from Columbus, Georgia, to Apalachicola, Florida, and the Flint River.

In 1964, the Eufaula National Wildlife Refuge was established along Lake Walter F. George to serve and protect many endangered and threatened species such as the American bald eagle, the American alligator, the wood stork and the peregrine falcon. The refuge is a major tourist attraction for visitors from around the country.

On March 3, 2019, a tornado hit the city as part of a larger tornado outbreak. On March 31, 2020, another tornado struck the city. There were no reports of fatalities or injuries.

Eufaula has never had an African American mayor. Jack Tibbs Jr. won his third term as mayor in 2020.

==History==
The Cahaba River falls near Centreville, which made the town a strategic location for transportation through the region. The first post office in Bibb County was established in Centreville in 1821. Sarah Willis Chotard obtained a patent for land in this area in 1823 and began moving squatters off the land and laid out a plot for the new town of Centreville.

In 1829, Centreville became the permanent seat for Bibb County after several years of debate and different locations of the county courthouse, and the town was incorporated in 1832. Centreville&#x27;s historic district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On May 27, 1973, a violent tornado struck the city, causing major damage across the area.

On March 25, 2021, a violent tornado hit the southern and eastern portions of Centreville, causing significant damage to the area and rendering the Bibb County Airport a total loss.

===1910 lynching===

In 1910, a white woman by the name of Mrs. Crow gave birth to a child of &quot;doubtful color&quot;, who was thought by many to be the product of a relationship between Crow and an African American, and she was accused of having such a relationship. At first she vigorously denied it, but then – under intense peer pressure – she confessed to the baby&#x27;s origin but claimed that she had been raped. When asked if she knew who raped her, Crow gave them the name of Grant Richardson, an African American who lived near the Braehead Slope Mine Camp, northeast of Centreville. The miners and other local residents were so incensed at the affair that they decided to apply &quot;summary vengeance&quot; to Richardson as soon as they knew that the sheriff had apprehended him.

Deputy Sheriff Cam Riley apprehended Richardson on October 12, 1910, and was returning him to the jail at Centreville for processing and trial, but was waylaid by a lynch mob. The mob took Richardson from Riley and shot the suspect. Chief Deputy Sheriff Charles Oakley investigated the scene as soon as word of the incident reached him, but other than the body, the shells, and the blood, there was little usable evidence to be found, much less witnesses. A coroner&#x27;s inquest was held as soon as a special coroner was appointed, but there is no known result of that inquest. This was the first recorded lynching to take place in Bibb County.

It is unknown whether charges of either filing false charges resulting in a murder or miscegenation were filed against Crow, but it is known by those aware of Richardson that he had lived in the area for a number of years with a fair reputation prior to the incident.

A local lime manufacturer believed he was not getting repeat business because of the difficulty in spelling the name of the village and persuaded the local postmaster to change the name, with the postmaster giving the village his own name of Allgood. The town was formally incorporated in 1959. In 2010, it became the first locality in Alabama to achieve a Hispanic plurality.

<text>Blountsville is a town in Blount County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 1,684.

Blount County was created by the Alabama territorial legislature on February 6, 1818, from land ceded to the federal government by the Creek Nation on August 9, 1814. It was named for Gov. Willie G. Blount of Tennessee, who provided assistance to settlers in Alabama during the Creek War of 1813–14. It lies in the northeastern section of the state, generally known as the mineral region.

==History==
What became Blountsville appears on an 1819 map as the mixed Creek/Cherokee Native American village of &quot;Wassausey&quot; (meaning Bear Meat Cabin, the name of an Indian translator who lived there). The town was established by Caleb Fryley and Johnny Jones in 1816 as Bear Meat Cabin. It became a popular stop for westward-bound settlers who streamed into the area at the end of the Creek War. The post office was opened as Blountsville on October 20, 1825, and incorporated on December 13, 1827. It was the county seat until 1889 when the government was moved to Oneonta.

There were many schools in the town in the early years: The Academy, Blount College and the District Agricultural School, plus the public schools. The Blount County Courthouse and jail was built in 1833 and remained there until it was moved to Oneonta. A major crossroads in early Alabama, Blountsville became a Confederate depot for the cavalry. Confederate forces led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest and Union forces led by General Abel Streight skirmished briefly in the town on May 1, 1863, and Major General Lovell H. Rousseau and his Union cavalry occupied the town in July 1864. Blount College was in the building that was originally the courthouse. It was established in 1890. The beautiful Blountsville United Methodist Church was established in 1818 and is the oldest building in Blountsville and is still in use today. Another old building in Blountsville was once known as the Barclift House. Built in 1834 as Hendricks Tavern, it is now owned and is being restored by the Ortiz family.

==Geography==
Blountsville is located in northern Blount County, in the Blountsville Valley at the intersection of County Highway 26 and U.S. Highway 231. Route 231 leads south to Cleveland and to Oneonta, the county seat, and north to Huntsville. Alabama Highway 79 runs through the southern corner of Blountsville, leading northeast to Guntersville and southwest to Birmingham.

==Attractions==

The Freeman House, built circa 1825, was damaged by a storm, and the two-story brick dwelling was rebuilt, using the same bricks, into a one story. The porches face the historic Meat Cabin Road, and the other porch faces U.S. Highway 231. The structure has been renovated by the Blountsville Historical Society and now serves as a museum and visitors&#x27; center. Several other buildings of the period have been added to the park and are furnished with period furnishings. The park is open to the public for tours.

The Thomas Nation House, circa 1835, is now a ruin due to a storm that took all but one and one half walls down in 1998 before the house could be stabilized. The ruins can still be seen from U.S. Highway 231.

Blountsville is also home to the Spring Valley Beach Water Park, one of the few water parks in the lower Sand Mountain area. Spring Valley Beach contains one of the largest swimming pools in the South and seven water slides. It is also home to the 360 Rush water slide, the only one of its kind in the world.

<text>Spock&#x27;s Beard is an American progressive rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1992 by brothers Neal (lead vocals, keyboards, guitar) and Alan Morse (guitars), John Ballard (bass), and Nick D&#x27;Virgilio (drums). Ballard was replaced by Dave Meros before the release of their debut album, &quot;The Light&quot; (1995), and Ryo Okumoto (keyboards) joined soon after. Neal Morse left the band following the release of their sixth album, &quot;Snow&quot; (2002), and D&#x27;Virgilio took over as the band&#x27;s frontman. In 2011, D&#x27;Virgilio also left and was replaced by Jimmy Keegan (drums) and Ted Leonard (lead vocals), from &quot;Brief Nocturnes and Dreamless Sleep&quot; (2013) onwards. As of 2025, the band have released thirteen studio albums and numerous live recordings.

Four of their first six albums have featured in the Prog Report&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Prog Albums 1990–2015&quot;, with &quot;The Light&quot; and &quot;Snow&quot; featuring in the top ten.

==History==
===Neal Morse era (1992–2002)===
Spock&#x27;s Beard was formed in Los Angeles in 1992 by brothers Neal and Alan Morse. Both had played together in bands in the 1980s and initially intended for their new project to be just the two of them, with Neal on vocals and keyboards and Alan on guitar. The brothers soon decided to form a full band and recruited drummer Nick D&#x27;Virgilio after meeting him at a blues jam in Los Angeles. John Ballard, a friend of Neal&#x27;s, was brought in to play bass but was replaced by Dave Meros before the band began recording demos for their first album. The group&#x27;s name is a reference to the 1967 &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. According to Alan Morse:

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Light&quot;, was recorded independently throughout 1994 and released later that year. While Neal Morse had performed the keyboard parts on the album, Ryo Okumoto was hired to fill in for live performances. One of their first major live shows was at the San Francisco Progfest in 1995, where they were introduced to Thomas Waber. Waber, a founding member of Giant Electric Pea and InsideOut Records, signed the band to Giant Electric Pea and licensed &quot;The Light&quot; for release in Europe.

===Nick D&#x27;Virgilio era (2002–2011)===
Immediately following the release of &quot;Snow&quot;, Neal Morse announced that he was leaving Spock&#x27;s Beard. Having recently converted to Christianity, Morse wanted to explore that aspect of his life more through his music but did not want to impose his beliefs upon the band. Nick D&#x27;Virgilio took over as the band&#x27;s lead singer. D&#x27;Virgilio would continue to play drums on studio albums, while Jimmy Keegan was hired to fill in for him as drummer during live performances.

On July 8, 2003, Spock&#x27;s Beard released their first album without Neal Morse, &quot;Feel Euphoria&quot;. Without their principal songwriter, the band adopted a more collaborative approach as well as enlisting the help of John Boegehold and Stan Ausmus with songwriting, both of whom would go on to contribute to all of the group&#x27;s subsequent albums. The result was a musical departure from previous albums, with a conscious shift towards a more modern sound, which was met with a mixed response from fans. On February 1, 2005, Spock&#x27;s Beard released their eighth album, &quot;Octane&quot;, which received a generally more positive reception from listeners. Several concerts from the &quot;Octane&quot; tour were recorded and the highlights released as &quot;Gluttons for Punishment&quot;, the band&#x27;s first live album since the departure of Neal Morse.

On May 21, 2006, Dave Meros confirmed that the group had begun working on their ninth studio album. Titled &quot;Spock&#x27;s Beard&quot;, it was released on November 21, 2006, to mixed reactions. The band continued to tour sporadically over the next few years, with a 2007 show in the Netherlands released as a live album. On July 23, 2009, Spock&#x27;s Beard announced they had begun work on their tenth album, to be released independently rather than through a record label. Production costs were covered by pre-orders through the band&#x27;s website. &quot;X&quot; was issued as a limited edition for those who had pre-ordered in May 2010. A standard edition was released at the end of August 2010 through Mascot Records, four years after the release of &quot;Spock&#x27;s Beard&quot;, the longest gap the band has had between albums. Mascot Records also released a live album, &quot;The X Tour Live&quot;, recorded at the only US show in support of the &quot;X&quot; album.

===Ted Leonard era (2011–present)===
Spock&#x27;s Beard played the Sweden Rock Festival in June and the High Voltage Festival in July 2011. On both occasions, Enchant vocalist Ted Leonard filled in for Nick D&#x27;Virgilio, who was unavailable to perform. The High Voltage performance featured an appearance by Neal Morse, who reunited with the band for the end of &quot;The Light&quot; and &quot;June&quot;, which was later released as a live album. On November 18, 2011, D&#x27;Virgilio announced his departure from the band, citing personal reasons and other commitments. Two days later, it was announced on the band&#x27;s official website that Leonard and touring drummer Jimmy Keegan would be joining the band.

On April 2, 2013, Spock&#x27;s Beard released &quot;Brief Nocturnes and Dreamless Sleep&quot;, their first studio album in this lineup. The recording and mastering of the album was funded using the crowdsourcing site Indiegogo and featured songwriting contributions from Neal Morse. On April 22, 2015, the band announced that their twelfth album would be titled &quot;The Oblivion Particle&quot; and released later that year. It came out on August 21, 2015. Later that year, the band issued &quot;The First Twenty Years&quot;, a compilation album spanning their entire career. It included a new song written by Neal Morse, &quot;Falling for Forever&quot;, which featured every past and current member of the band except John Ballard, due to his aforementioned departure in 1993 and death in 1999.

In July 2016, the current lineup of the band reunited with D&#x27;Virgilio and Neal Morse for shows at Morsefest in Cross Plains, Tennessee, and at the Night of the Prog festival in Lorelei, Germany, to perform &quot;Snow&quot; in its entirety. On October 12, 2016, Keegan announced that he was leaving the band for personal reasons. D&#x27;Virgilio filled in on drums and backing vocals for their performance on Cruise to the Edge 2017. On March 25, 2017, it was confirmed that D&#x27;Virgilio had agreed to play on the band&#x27;s upcoming thirteenth album, with recording expected to begin in May of that year On February 28, 2018, Dave Meros announced that the new album would be titled &quot;Noise Floor&quot; and would be released on May 25, 2018. On June 13, Spock&#x27;s Beard announced a tour in support of the album, with former Saga drummer Mike Thorne as a touring drummer.

In 2018, a spinoff of Spock&#x27;s Beard, Pattern-Seeking Animals, was formed by Ted Leonard, Dave Meros, Jimmy Keegan, and John Boegehold. As of 2025, they have released five studio albums.

==Musical style==

<doc id="100818" wikidata="Q602140" url="?curid=100818" title="Murray Hill, Manhattan">
<text>Murray Hill is a neighborhood on the east side of Manhattan in New York City. Murray Hill is generally bordered to the east by the East River or Kips Bay and to the west by Midtown Manhattan, though the exact boundaries are disputed. Murray Hill is situated on a steep glacial hill that peaked between Lexington Avenue and Broadway. It was named after Robert Murray, the head of the Murray family, a mercantile family that settled in the area in the 18th century.

The Murray farm was formed before 1762 and existed until at least the early 19th century. Through the 19th century, Murray Hill was relatively isolated from the rest of New York City, which at the time was centered in Lower Manhattan. Murray Hill became an upscale neighborhood during the 20th century. Today, it contains several cultural institutions such as the Morgan Library &amp; Museum, as well as missions and consulates to the nearby United Nations headquarters. The neighborhood also contains architectural landmarks, some of which are in the Murray Hill Historic District, a city and national historic district.

Murray Hill is part of Manhattan Community District 6, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10016 and 10017. It is patrolled by the 17th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==Geography==
Murray Hill derives its name from Robert Murray (1721–1786), a Scottish-born merchant, whose family had a large estate in what is now the modern-day neighborhood. The modern neighborhood was once an abrupt, steep-sided mound of glacial till typical of Manhattan Island&#x27;s still-unmodified post-glacial terrain. It was described by one author as a &quot;hill of the rudest and most heterogeneous mixture of stone and gravel and boulders, cemented together into a matrix of almost impenetrable density existed, crowning the underlying schist... It had a natural rise from 34th Street, sinking towards 42nd Street and reaching from Lexington Avenue to Broadway.&quot; The hill still exists, with an incline from 31st to 35th Streets, as well as a decline north of 37th Street.

During the 19th century, modern-day Murray Hill was &quot;uptown&quot; with the city ending with the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street covering what today is the New York Public Library Main Branch and Bryant Park. To the north was for the most part farmland. A stream called &quot;t&#x27;Oude Wrack&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Old Wreck&quot;) ran across the area, emptying into Sunfish Pond, located at the present-day Park Avenue South and 31st Street in Kips Bay. The stream originated at what is now Broadway and 44th Street in the middle of Times Square. A glue factory polluted Sunfish Pond heavily during the 1820s; it was infilled in 1839 after most of its water was used to extinguish a fire at the New York House of Refuge.

=== Boundaries ===
According to the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association (formerly the Murray Hill Committee), the neighborhood encompasses the 10016 zip code—bounded by 27th Street to the south, 40th Street to the north, Fifth Avenue to the west, and the East River to the east. By this definition, Murray Hill overlaps with Rose Hill, which is also known as Curry Hill and Little India. This section of Murray Hill was formerly also known as Little Armenia.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has described Murray Hill&#x27;s boundaries as roughly 34th Street on the south, 40th Street on the north, Fifth Avenue on the west, and Third Avenue on the east. The city&#x27;s Planning Department has described the boundaries as roughly 34th Street on the south, 40th Street on the north, Madison Avenue on the west, and Second Avenue on the east. Manhattan Community Board 6—of which Murray Hill is part—has defined the boundaries as 34th Street to the south, 40th Street to the north, Madison Avenue to the west, and the East River to the east. This definition explicitly excludes Tudor City, just north of 40th Street between First and Second Avenues, which the community board&#x27;s chairman said in 2021 &quot;is considered its own neighborhood&quot;.

For its entry on Murray Hill, the American Institute of Architects&#x27; &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; uses the area bounded by 32nd Street to the south, 40th Street to the north, Madison Avenue to the west, and Third Avenue to the east. In &quot;AIA Guide&quot;, Murray Hill abuts Midtown to the north and west, Kips Bay to the east, and Rose Hill to the south. Robert A. M. Stern&#x27;s book &quot;New York 1960&quot; defined the area as being bounded precisely by 34th Street to the south, 42nd Street to the north, Fifth Avenue to the west, and Third Avenue to the east.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; states that commonly used boundaries of Murray Hill are 34th Street to the south, 42nd Street to the north, Madison Avenue to the west, and the East River to the east. Additionally, &quot;the younger, more bar-centric area south of the neighborhood in the upper 20s and lower 30s&quot; is sometimes held to be part of Murray Hill. &quot;Times&quot; architectural critic Herbert Muschamp, writing in 1997, said the &quot;Zagat Survey&quot; defined all of the area bounded by East 30th and 40th Streets between the East River and Fifth Avenue as part of Murray Hill. Summarizing the conflicting boundaries, Muschamp said that a then-recent survey of residents found many were unable to distinguish Murray Hill by its name.

==History==
What is now Midtown Manhattan was first settled by the Munsee Native Americans. With European colonization in the 17th century, the site was called Belmont and was part of the common lands of New York City.

===18th century===
Robert Murray (1721–1786) moved from Philadelphia to New York City in 1753. During that decade, he became a prosperous merchant, purchasing three vessels and obtaining an ownership stake in another. Murray had a townhouse on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan, which was close to his wharf on the East River at Wall Street, as well as to his retail store.

==== Creation of Murray estate ====
By the late 1750s, Murray was relatively successful and wished to build his own mansion. Before 1762, Murray had leased some land in a sparsely populated portion of Manhattan island for use as for his large house and farm. Murray&#x27;s house was built on a since-leveled hill at what is today Park Avenue and 36th Street. The hill was named &quot;Inclenberg&quot;, or &quot;fire beacon hill&quot; in Dutch, referencing the fact that settlers of New Amsterdam used fire beacons to give notice of armed Native American groups. The Murray farm&#x27;s total area was just under . The farm began a few feet south of modern-day 33rd Street and extended north to the middle of the block between 38th and 39th Streets. At the southern end, the plot was narrow, but at the northern end it extended from approximately Lexington Avenue to a spot between Madison and Fifth Avenues.

The great square house, west of the Eastern Post Road, was approached by an avenue of mixed trees leading from the road. It was flanked on three sides by verandas and contained apartments on either side of a large hall. The mansion was at approximately the present location of Park Avenue and 37th Street. Near the house were a barn, kitchen, and stable. The Murray farm was bounded to the north by Thomas Bridgen Atwood&#x27;s farm, which was on the western side of the Eastern Post Road between modern-day 38th and 41st Streets, and to the east by Jacobus Kip&#x27;s farm, along the eastern side of the same road from 28th to 39th Street extending to the East River.

The site overlooked the East River and Kips Bay. Like the other grand projects created by distinguished residents upon Manhattan&#x27;s prominent rises of ground, the Murray house was used for purposes other than farming. According to historians Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, while some of these farms were for-profit enterprises, &quot;their primary purpose—besides providing refuge from epidemics—was to serve as theaters of refinement&quot;. One descendant wrote that Robert Murray &quot;entertained at various times almost every foreigner of distinction who came to the American shores&quot;. Early in 1773, and again in 1774, advertisements for the Inclenberg estate were circulated, positioning the house and farm as a summer mansion.

==== American Revolution and late century ====
During the American Revolutionary War, Mary Lindley Murray is credited with delaying William Howe and his army during General Washington&#x27;s retreat from New York following the British landing at Kip&#x27;s Bay, September 15, 1776. The most common version of the story is that Mrs. Murray invited the officers to tea and succeeded in delaying the British troops for a period sufficient to allow a successful American retreat. The Rev. T. Dewitt Talmage said she saved American independence by detaining Lord Howe long enough to permit Israel Putnam to pass up the Greenwich road from the city and join the forces of George Washington in the north end of the island, before Howe was able to overtake him. The 3,500 men led by Washington were able to escape safely. James Thacher, a surgeon with the Continental Army, wrote in his journal: &quot;It is a common saying among our officers that Mrs. Murray saved this part of the American army.&quot;

According to later scholarship, the Murrays did not have such a large influence on the landing at Kip&#x27;s Bay than was portrayed in contemporary sources. One contemporary rumor posited that Mrs. Murray and her two daughters had used &quot;feminine wiles&quot; to convince the officers to stop by for tea. However, later scholarship stated that Howe had ordered his troops to stand down until all the British Army troops had landed at Kips Bay. According to these writers, it was unlikely that Mrs. Murray would have known that Putnam was escaping on Manhattan&#x27;s west side, given that the farm was on the island&#x27;s east side. Furthermore, Robert Murray traded with both Continental and British Army soldiers. Nevertheless, the Murrays&#x27; actions during the war inspired at least two Broadway shows. The Daughters of the American Revolution placed a plaque in 1926 near the site of the Murray mansion, commemorating the family&#x27;s wartime actions.

From 1776 to 1783, when the British Army occupied New York, British soldiers often visited Inclenberg. After the end of British occupation, the Murray family was associated with unpatriotic acts during the war, and one son, Lindley Murray, moved to England. Robert Murray died in 1786 and bequeathed different portions of his estate to his five children. His daughter Susannah was bequeathed the farm, along with some lots in Gold Street in Lower Manhattan. Her husband Gilbert Colden Willett, once a Loyalist general in the Revolutionary War, jointly ran Willett &amp; Murray with Susannah&#x27;s uncle John Murray. Willett bought the farm from the New York City government in 1799 for 907 pounds. His business shuttered the next year and, as part of the bankruptcy settlement, John Murray bought the farm from the Willetts.

===19th century===

==== Initial development ====
John Murray and his wife Hannah Lindley had four children. After John Murray&#x27;s death in 1808, Hannah Lindley and their children moved into Inclenberg. Two of their children, Mary and Hannah, did not marry and instead lived in apartments that were specifically created for them at the estate. In the winter of 1808 during the embargo that closed New York Harbor, a work relief program kept out-of-work dock workers busy reducing the height of Murray Hill. Between twenty and forty feet were sliced off its summit and used for fill. Around that time, the area was subdivided into a regular street grid with the enactment of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811. Under the plan, what is now Third Avenue was opened between 1815 and 1821.

John Murray&#x27;s children confirmed title to the land in 1816, and Mary and Hannah Murray were given the responsibility of renting out the Murray farm. In 1818, they ran advertisements for the farm, which was only from the developed portions of Manhattan. A fire destroyed Inclenberg in 1835 and the lots were split up. The route of the Eastern Post Road from 23rd to 31st Street was closed in April 1844, and the section of the road from 31st to 42nd Street was closed in June 1848.

In 1833 the railroad cut was begun, to carry the New York and Harlem Rail Road through Murray Hill; the route under the most prominent obstacle in its right-of-way was opened on May 1, 1834. The locomotives, which had met the horse-cars that ran through the city&#x27;s streets at the station at 27th Street, could pass the reduced hill. By an act of 1850 the city permitted to roof over the cut for the passage of steam locomotives. This Park Avenue Tunnel, enlarged and relined, has been devoted to automobile traffic since 1937.

==== Row houses and later development ====
In mid-century, the rich temporarily, and the upper middle class more permanently, filled the brownstone row houses that filled Murray Hill&#x27;s streets. The Brick Presbyterian Church followed its congregation; after selling its site facing City Hall Park, it rebuilt in 1857 closer to its congregation, on the smoothed brow of Murray Hill, at Fifth Avenue and 37th Street. However, when J. P. Morgan built his conservative brownstone free-standing mansion in 1882 on Madison Avenue at 36th Street (later part of The Morgan Library &amp; Museum), it was considered a fashionable but slightly old-fashioned address, as the rich were filling Fifth Avenue with palaces as far as Central Park. Instead stylish merchandising was changing the neighborhood; Madison Square Park, at this time considered a part of Murray Hill, was bordered by the fashionable ladies&#x27; shops of the day on Fifth Avenue.

In 1925, the architectural firm Margon &amp; Glaser designed the Griffon, a residential building at 77 Park Avenue and 39th Street. The Griffon which was converted into a condominium in 1969 and is known for its stunning lobby as well as its oversized apartment layouts with original details and fireplaces. The Griffon is included in the NRHP&#x27;s Murray Hill historic district.

===Late 20th century to present===

For much of the 20th century, Murray Hill was a quiet and rather formal place, with many wealthy older residents. In 1905, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt lived close by Franklin&#x27;s mother Sara Roosevelt in the Murray Hill neighborhood.

Since the late 1990s, many young people in their twenties have moved to the area from the suburbs of New York. As reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2011, &quot;...recent college graduates can find themselves among fellow alumni, meet up for familiar drinking rituals and flock to the frozen-yogurt shops and sushi bars that help them stay fit and find a mate for the next stage of life&quot;. On weekends, the raucous restaurant-and-bar scene along Third Avenue, beyond the traditional eastern limits of Murray Hill, particularly reflects this change. In the late 1990s, Murray Hill began to attract an influx of young college graduates, leading to a &quot;work-hard, play-hard&quot; atmosphere, which has since been referenced in several media sources such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Post&quot;. Though housing in the neighborhood is slightly cheaper than in fashionable nearby parts of Manhattan, prices for apartments here rose greatly during the boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s—as much as 500 percent in a decade.

The eastern part of Murray Hill, between FDR Drive and First Avenue from 34th to 41st Streets, formerly contained industrial uses including a Coca-Cola bottling plant, Consolidated Edison&#x27;s Kips Bay Generating Station, the Kips Bay Brewing Company, and Con Edison&#x27;s Waterside power plant. In the 1980s some of these blocks were rezoned to allow for residential development, which led to the construction of the Rivergate, Manhattan Place, and Horizon high-rise apartment buildings. Con Edison&#x27;s lots were placed for sale in 1999. The billionaire developer Sheldon Solow purchased the three plots of land in 2000 and demolished the sites in anticipation of the construction of a multi-building complex. However, these plans stalled with the financial crisis of 2007–2008, and the land lay unused. Solow later sold the 35th–36th Streets plot, and the American Copper Buildings were built on that site, opening in 2017–2018. Solow commissioned architect Richard Meier to design a residential tower on the 39th–40th Streets plot, 685 First Avenue, which began construction in 2016 and was completed in 2018. , the 38th–41st Streets plot was still unused, but Solow intended to construct a four-building condo and office complex on that site.

Buckley, Jr., most of that time at 150 East 35th Street and 215 Lexington Avenue at 33rd Street. 150 East 35th Street was purchased by Yeshiva University.

=== Historic district ===

==Telephone exchange==
For the most part of the 20th century the name &quot;Murray Hill&quot; was used by New York Telephone as a telephone exchange for residents living on the East Side of Manhattan, served from the East 37th Street exchange building. Though the entire city was covered by area code 212 until the 1980s, most neighborhoods at the time would be grouped together by a particular exchange name. Other municipalities in the United States would also use MUrray or MUrray Hill as an exchange name. The first two letters in MUrray (capitalized to indicate that they should be dialed) would be followed by five digits to make up a telephone number, such as MUrray Hill 5-9975 (the Ricardos&#x27; number on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;). This was the way most telephone numbers were given until AT&amp;T switched to all-number calling by the late 1970s to early 1980s. Nevertheless, the name MUrray Hill is still applicable, as many East Side phone numbers in area code 212 still begin with 68, which corresponds to MU on the telephone keypad.

<doc id="100821" wikidata="Q461572" url="?curid=100821" title="SoHo, Manhattan">
<text>SoHo, short for &quot;South of Houston Street&quot;, is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Since the 1970s, the neighborhood has been the location of many artists&#x27; lofts and art galleries, and has also been known for its variety of shops ranging from trendy upscale boutiques to national and international chain store locations. The area&#x27;s history is an archetypal example of inner-city regeneration and gentrification, encompassing socioeconomic, cultural, political, and architectural developments.

The name &quot;SoHo&quot; derives from the area being &quot;South of Houston Street&quot;, and was coined in 1962 by Chester Rapkin, an urban planner and author of &quot;The South Houston Industrial Area&quot; study, also known as the &quot;Rapkin Report&quot;. The name also recalls Soho, an area in London&#x27;s West End.

Almost all of SoHo is included in the SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District, which was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1973, extended in 2010, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 
1978. It consists of 26 blocks and approximately 500 buildings, many of them incorporating cast-iron architectural elements. Many side streets in the district are paved with Belgian blocks.

SoHo is part of Manhattan Community District 2 and its primary ZIP Codes are 10012 and 10013. It is patrolled by the 1st and 5th Precincts of the New York City Police Department.

==Geography==

===Boundaries===
Because of the nature of neighborhoods in New York City, different sources will often give different boundaries for each one. In the case of SoHo, all sources appear to agree that the northern boundary is Houston Street, and the southern boundary is Canal Street, but the location of the eastern and western boundaries is disputed.

In 1974, shortly after SoHo first came into existence, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the boundaries as &quot;stretching from Houston to Canal Streets between West Broadway and Lafayette Street&quot; – a definition it continued to hold to in 2016 – but &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; reports that SoHo is bounded by Crosby Street on the east, and Sixth Avenue to the west. These are the same boundaries shown by Google Maps. However, the &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; gives the western boundary of SoHo north of Broome Street as being West Broadway, and &quot;New York&quot; magazine gives the eastern boundary as Lafayette Street and the western boundary as the Hudson River.

The map at the Community Board 2 profile page on New York City&#x27;s official website has &quot;SOHO&quot; written near Broadway in the space roughly equidistant between Houston Street and Canal Street.

In the 1990s, real estate agents began giving an adjacent neighborhood below West Houston Street various appellations, with no general agreement on whether it should be called (or included as part of) West SoHo, Hudson Square or the South Village. The &quot;AIA Guide&quot; calls that neighborhood &quot;An intersection of brick and glass, searching for an identity&quot;, and refers to the western section of it as &quot;The Glass Box District&quot;. Unlike Hudson Square, the South Village has traditionally appeared on maps of Community District 2, centered near the intersection of Houston Street and Avenue of the Americas. The more recent map of Community District 2 contains both the South Village and Hudson Square, with the latter written in the area below Houston Street, between Hudson Street and the Hudson River.

===Historic District===
The SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District is contained within the zoned SoHo neighborhood. Originally ending in the west at the eastern side of West Broadway and to the east at the western side of Crosby Street, the SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District was expanded in 2010 to cover most of West Broadway and to extend east to Lafayette and Centre Streets. The boundary lines are not straight, and some block-fronts on West Broadway and Lafayette are excluded from the District.

==History==
===Early years===
During the colonial period, the land that is now SoHo was part of a grant of farmland given to freed slaves of the Dutch West Indies Company, and the site of the first free Black settlement on Manhattan island. This land was acquired in the 1660s by Augustine Hermann, and then passed to his brother-in-law, Nicholas Bayard. The estate was confiscated by the state as a result of Bayard&#x27;s part in Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion, but was returned to him after the sentence was annulled.

In the 18th century natural barriers – streams and hills – impeded the growth of the city northward into the Bayard estate, and the area maintained its rural character. During the American Revolution, the area was the location of numerous fortifications, redoubts and breastworks. After the war, Bayard, who had suffered financially because of it, was forced to mortgage some of the property, which was divided up into lots, but even then there was very little development in the area, aside from some manufacturing at Broadway and Canal Street.

Serious development of the area did not begin until the Common Council, answering the complaints of landowners in the area, drained the Collect Pond, which had once been an important source of fresh water for the island, but which had become polluted and rank and a breeding ground for mosquitoes. A canal was built to drain the pond into the Hudson, and the canal and pond were both later filled in using earth from nearby Bayard&#x27;s Hill. Once Broadway was paved and sidewalks were built there and along Canal Street, more people began to make their homes there, joining earlier arrivals such as James Fenimore Cooper.

=== Commerce, entertainment, and decline===
By the mid-19th century, the early Federal- and Greek Revival-style homes were replaced by more-solid structures of masonry and cast iron, and along Broadway, large marble-skinned commercial establishments began to open, such as Lord &amp; Taylor, Arnold Constable &amp; Company and Tiffany &amp; Company, as well as grand hotels such as the St. Nicholas and the Metropolitan. Theatres followed in their wake, and Broadway between Canal and Houston Streets became a lively theater and shopping district and the entertainment center of New York; as usual with such areas, it was home to many brothels as well, and the side streets off of Broadway became the city&#x27;s red-light district. As this change in character drove out the middle-class, their place was taken by small manufacturing concerns, including cabinet-makers and the lumberyards that supplied them, brass and copper firms, makers of china and glassware, locksmiths, snuff manufacturers and book publishers.

This dramatic shift in the nature of the neighborhood continued to drive out residents, and between 1860 and 1865 the Eighth Ward, which included the SoHo area, lost 25% of its population. After the Civil War and the Panic of 1873, in the 1880s and 1890s, large manufacturers began to move into the area, especially textile firms, and the area became the mercantile and wholesale dry-goods trade center of the city, and was the subject of significant real-estate speculation. This phase came to an end by the close of the 19th century, and as the center of the city continued to move uptown, the quality of the area declined.

After World War II, the textile industry largely moved to the South, leaving many large buildings in the district unoccupied. In some buildings they were replaced by warehouses and printing plants, and other buildings were torn down to be replaced by gas stations, auto repair shops and parking lots and garages. By the 1950s, the area had become known as Hell&#x27;s Hundred Acres, an industrial wasteland, full of sweatshops and small factories in the daytime, but empty at night. It would not be until the 1960s, when artists began to be interested in the tall ceilings and many windows of the empty manufacturing lofts, that the character of the neighborhood began to change again.

===Cast-iron architecture===
SoHo boasts the greatest collection of cast-iron architecture in the world. Approximately 250 cast-iron buildings stand in New York City, and the majority are in SoHo. Cast iron was initially used as a decorative front over a pre-existing building. With the addition of modern, decorative facades, older industrial buildings were able to attract new commercial clients. Most of these facades were constructed during the period from 1840 to 1880. In addition to revitalizing older structures, buildings in SoHo were later designed to feature the cast iron.

An American architectural innovation, cast iron was cheaper to use for facades than materials such as stone or brick. Molds of ornamentation, prefabricated in foundries, were used interchangeably for many buildings, and a broken piece could be easily recast. The buildings could be erected quickly; some were built in four months. Despite the brief construction period, the quality of the cast-iron designs was not sacrificed. Bronze had previously been the metal most frequently used for architectural detail. Architects found that the relatively inexpensive cast iron could provide intricately designed patterns. Classical French and Italian architectural designs were often used as models for these facades. Because stone was the material associated with architectural masterpieces, cast iron, painted in neutral tints such as beige, was used to simulate stone.

There was a profusion of cast iron foundries in New York, including Badger&#x27;s Architectural Iron Works, James L. Jackson&#x27;s Iron Works, and Cornell Iron Works.

Since the iron was pliable and easily molded, sumptuously curved window frames were created, and the strength of the metal allowed these frames considerable height. The once-somber, gas-lit interiors of the industrial district were flooded with sunlight through the enlarged windows. The strength of cast iron permitted high ceilings with sleek supporting columns, and interiors became expansive and functional.

During cast iron&#x27;s heyday, many architects thought it to be structurally more sound than steel. It was also thought that cast iron would be fire-resistant, and facades were constructed over many interiors built of wood and other flammable materials. When exposed to heat, cast iron buckled, and later cracked under the cold water used to extinguish fire. In 1899, a building code mandating the backing of cast-iron fronts with masonry was passed. Most of the buildings that stand today are constructed in this way. It was the advent of steel as a major construction material that brought an end to the cast iron era.

===Lower Manhattan Expressway===
In the 1960s, the SoHo area was to have been the location of two enormous elevated highways that comprised the two branches of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, a Robert Moses project that was intended to create an automobile and truck through-route connecting the Manhattan Bridge and Williamsburg Bridge on the east with the Holland Tunnel on the west.

The young historic preservation movement and architectural critics, stung by the destruction of the original Pennsylvania Station in 1963 and the threat to other historic structures, challenged the plans because of the threatened loss of a huge quantity of 19th-century cast-iron buildings.

When John V. Lindsay became mayor of New York City in 1966, his initial reaction was to try to push the expressways through, dubbing the project the Lower Manhattan Expressway, depressing some of the proposed highway in residential areas and stressing the importance of the artery to the city. Nevertheless, through the efforts of Jane Jacobs, Tony D&#x27;Apolito, Margot Gayle, and other local, civic, and cultural leaders, as well as SoHo artist residents themselves, the project was derailed.

===Artists move in===
After the abandonment of the highway scheme, the city was left with a large number of historic buildings that were unattractive for the kinds of manufacturing and commerce that survived in the city in the 1970s. The upper floors of many of these buildings had been built as commercial Manhattan lofts, which provided large, unobstructed spaces for manufacturing and other industrial uses. These spaces attracted artists who valued them for their large areas, large windows admitting natural light and low rents. Most of these spaces were also used illegally as living space, despite being neither zoned nor equipped for residential use. This widespread zoning violation was ignored for a long period of time, as the artist-occupants were using space for which there was little demand due to the city&#x27;s poor economy at the time, and would have lain dormant or been abandoned otherwise.

Nevertheless, as the artist population grew, the city made some attempts to stem the movement, concerned about the occupation of space that did not meet residential building codes, and the possibility that the occupied space might be needed for the return of manufacturing to New York City. Pressured on many sides, including by organizations such as the Artist Tenant Association and later the Soho Artist Association, the city abandoned attempts to keep the district as strictly industrial space, and in 1971, the Zoning Resolution was amended to permit Joint Live-Work Quarters for artists, and the M1-5a and M-5b districting was established to permit visual artists, certified as such by the Department of Cultural Affairs, to live where they worked. In 1987, non-artists residing in SoHo and NoHo were permitted to grandfather themselves, but that was the only extension to non-artists and was a one-time agreement.

The area received landmark designation as the SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District in 1973.

===Gentrification and shopping===
In 2005, the construction of residential buildings on empty lots in the historic district was permitted. Nevertheless, with no enforcement of the new zoning laws by the city, beginning in the 1980s, in a way that would later apply elsewhere, the neighborhood began to draw more affluent residents. Due to rent protection and stability afforded by the 1982 Loft Law, in addition to the fact that many of the artists owned their co-ops, many of the original pioneering artists remained despite the popular misconception that gentrification forced them to flee. Many residents have lived in the neighborhood for decades. In the mid-1990s, most of the galleries moved to Chelsea, but several galleries remain as of 2013, including DTR Modern Galleries, William Bennett Gallery, Martin Lawrence Galleries, Terrain Gallery, Franklin Bowles Gallery, and Pop International Gallery.

SoHo&#x27;s location, the appeal of lofts as living spaces, its architecture, and its reputation as a haven for artists all contributed to this change. The pattern of gentrification is typically known as the &quot;SoHo Effect&quot; and has been observed elsewhere in the United States. A backwater of poor artists and small factories in the 1970s, SoHo became a popular tourist destination for people seeking fashionable clothing and exquisite architecture, and home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

SoHo&#x27;s chain outlets are clustered in the northern area of the neighborhood, along Broadway and Prince and Spring Streets. The sidewalks in this area are often crowded with tourists and with vendors selling jewelry, T-shirts, and other works. SoHo is known for its commercialization and eclectic mix of boutiques for shopping – although in 2010, it had twice as many chain stores as boutiques and three times as many boutiques as art galleries.

===Rezoning===
Despite the significant change in the neighborhood&#x27;s character in the previous decades, by the end of the 2010s the area&#x27;s zoning still reflected its industrial heritage; any new residential development required special permits. As such, in 2019 the city began a public consultation process called &quot;Envision SoHo/NoHo&quot; to plan for future growth and manage change, and ultimately to bring land use rules in line with the mainly residential and commercial present-day reality of the neighborhood.

A coalition of nearly two dozen housing and social organizations, led by pro-housing advocacy group Open New York, and including the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, the Regional Plan Association, and Habitat for Humanity, seized on the idea of a rezoning as a means of alleviating the city&#x27;s housing shortage. In October 2019, the coalition put forward a rezoning plan that would produce 3,400 additional housing units, nearly 700 of which would be affordable, and later that month the city officially proposed a similar plan that envisaged the creation of 3,200 new residential units and up to 800 affordable units. Observers suggested that the coalition&#x27;s campaign for a residential rezoning had spurred a previously reluctant mayor to act, noting that even real estate industry groups like the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY), the city&#x27;s largest real estate trade organization, had shown no interest in a rezoning of SoHo and NoHo. The proposal was immediately contentious; while most major candidates in the Democratic mayoral and Manhattan borough president primaries endorsed the plan, at least in principle, candidates for the city council district were more divided.

A group of a half-dozen neighborhood groups, led by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, put forth a &quot;community alternative plan&quot; which they claimed would create more affordable housing without any major new development, and a report attacking the city&#x27;s plan, a claim that was challenged by the city and other civic organizations. Carl Weisbrod, former chairman of the New York City Planning Commission said the GVSHP&#x27;s report was &quot;misleading and disingenuous&quot;, and a spokesman for the mayor&#x27;s office described the &quot;community alternative plan&quot; as &quot;an exercise in magical 
thinking&quot;. In July 2021, the area&#x27;s community board voted to reject the proposal, although the vote was ultimately non-binding. In September 2021, Manhattan Borough president Gale Brewer expressed concerns about the plan, particularly the potential for the plan to incentivize commercial development rather than residential, a criticism echoed by some of the housing advocates who had initially pushed for the plan.

In 2022, a team of over 2,000 players constructed a recreation of Soho in the sandbox game Minecraft, as part of the COVID-19 Build the Earth movement.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies SoHo as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called SoHo-TriBeCa-Civic Center-Little Italy. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of SoHo-TriBeCa-Civic Center-Little Italy was 42,742, a change of 5,985 (14%) from the 36,757 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 66.1% (28,250) White, 2.2% (934) African American, 0.1% (30) Native American, 22.2% (9,478) Asian, 0% (11) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (171) from other races, and 2.6% (1,098) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.5% (2,770) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 2, which comprises SoHo and Greenwich Village, had 91,638 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.8 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (42%) are between the ages of 25 and 44, while 24% are between 45 and 64, and 15% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 9% and 10% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 1 and 2 (including the Financial District and Tribeca) was $144,878, though the median income in SoHo individually was $124,396. In 2018, an estimated 9% of SoHo and Greenwich Village residents lived in poverty, compared to 20% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty-five residents (4%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 38% in SoHo and Greenwich Village, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , SoHo and Greenwich Village are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

==Police and crime==
SoHo and Lower Manhattan are patrolled by the 1st Precinct of the NYPD, at 16 Ericsson Place. The 1st Precinct ranked 63rd safest out of 69 city precincts for per-capita crime in 2010. Though the number of crimes is low compared to other NYPD precincts, the residential population is also much lower. With a non-fatal assault rate of 10 per 100,000 people, SoHo&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 100 per 100,000 people is also lower than that of the city as a whole.

The 1st Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 86.3% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct saw 1 murder, 23 rapes, 80 robberies, 61 felony assaults, 85 burglaries, 1,085 grand larcenies, and 21 grand larcenies auto in 2018.

==Fire safety==
SoHo is served by two New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire stations:

* Engine Co. 24/Ladder Company 5/Battalion 2 – 227 6th Avenue
* Ladder Company 20/Division 1 – 253 Lafayette Street

==Health==
Preterm births are more common in SoHo and Greenwich Village than in other places citywide, though teenage births are less common. In SoHo and Greenwich Village, there were 91 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 1 teenage birth per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide), though the teenage birth rate is based on a small sample size. SoHo and Greenwich Village have a low population of residents who are uninsured. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 4%, less than the citywide rate of 12%, though this was based on a small sample size.

The concentration of fine particulate matter, the deadliest type of air pollutant, in SoHo and Greenwich Village is , more than the city average. Sixteen percent of SoHo and Greenwich Village residents are smokers, which is more than the city average of 14% of residents being smokers. In SoHo and Greenwich Village, 4% of residents are obese, 3% are diabetic, and 15% have high blood pressure, the lowest rates in the city – compared to the citywide averages of 24%, 11%, and 28% respectively. In addition, 5% of children are obese, the lowest rate in the city, compared to the citywide average of 20%.

Ninety-six percent of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is more than the city&#x27;s average of 87%. In 2018, 91% of residents described their health as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;very good&quot;, or &quot;excellent&quot;, more than the city&#x27;s average of 78%. For every supermarket in SoHo and Greenwich Village, there are 7 bodegas.

The nearest major hospitals are Beth Israel Medical Center in Stuyvesant Town, as well as the Bellevue Hospital Center and NYU Langone Medical Center in Kips Bay, and NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital in the Civic Center area.

==Post offices and ZIP Codes==
SoHo is within two primary ZIP Codes. The area north of Broome Street is in 10012 while the area south of Broome Street is in 10013. The United States Postal Service operates two post offices near SoHo both in ZIP 10014:
* Village Station – 201 Varick Street at King Street.

<doc id="100822" wikidata="Q181066" url="?curid=100822" title="Shorthand">
<text>Shorthand is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases speed and brevity of writing as compared to longhand, a more common method of writing a language. The process of writing in shorthand is called stenography, from the Greek &quot;stenos&quot; (narrow) and &quot;graphein&quot; (to write). It has also been called brachygraphy, from Greek &quot;brachys&quot; (short), and tachygraphy, from Greek &quot;tachys&quot; (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of writing is the goal.

Many forms of shorthand exist. A typical shorthand system provides symbols or abbreviations for words and common phrases, which can allow someone well-trained in the system to write as quickly as people speak. Abbreviation methods are alphabet-based and use different abbreviating approaches. Many journalists use shorthand writing to quickly take notes at press conferences or other similar scenarios. In the computerized world, several autocomplete programs, standalone or integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a shorthand function for frequently used phrases.

Shorthand was used more widely in the past, before the invention of recording and dictation machines. Shorthand was considered an essential part of secretarial training and police work and was useful for journalists. Although the primary use of shorthand has been to record oral dictation and other types of verbal communication, some systems are used for compact expression. For example, healthcare professionals might use shorthand notes in medical charts and correspondence. Shorthand notes were typically temporary, intended either for immediate use or for later typing, data entry, or (mainly historically) transcription to longhand. Longer-term uses do exist, such as encipherment: diaries (like that of Samuel Pepys) are a common example.

== History ==

=== Classical antiquity ===

The earliest known indication of shorthand systems is from the Parthenon in Ancient Greece, where a mid-4th century BC inscribed marble slab was found. This shows a writing system primarily based on vowels, using certain modifications to indicate consonants. Hellenistic tachygraphy is reported from the 2nd century BC onwards, though there are indications that it might be older. The oldest datable reference is a contract from Middle Egypt, stating that Oxyrhynchos gives the &quot;semeiographer&quot; Apollonios for two years to be taught shorthand writing. Hellenistic tachygraphy consisted of word stem signs and word ending signs. Over time, many syllabic signs were developed.

In Ancient Rome, Marcus Tullius Tiro (103–4 BC), a slave and later a freedman of Cicero, developed the Tironian notes so that he could write down Cicero&#x27;s speeches. Plutarch in his &quot;Life of Cato the Younger&quot; (95–46 BC) records that Cicero, during a trial of some insurrectionists in the senate, employed several expert rapid writers, whom he had taught to make figures comprising numerous words in a few short strokes, to preserve Cato&#x27;s speech on this occasion. The Tironian notes consisted of Latin word stem abbreviations (&quot;notae&quot;) and of word ending abbreviations (&quot;titulae&quot;). The original Tironian notes consisted of about 4,000 signs, but new signs were introduced, so that their number might increase to as many as 13,000. In order to have a less complex writing system, a syllabic shorthand script was sometimes used. After the decline of the Roman Empire, the Tironian notes were no longer used to transcribe speeches, though they were still known and taught, particularly during the Carolingian Renaissance. After the 11th century, however, they were mostly forgotten.

When many monastery libraries were secularized in the course of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, long-forgotten manuscripts of Tironian notes were rediscovered.

=== Imperial China ===
In imperial China, clerks used an abbreviated, highly cursive form of Chinese characters to record court proceedings and criminal confessions. These records were used to create more formal transcripts. One cornerstone of imperial court proceedings was that all confessions had to be acknowledged by the accused&#x27;s signature, personal seal, or thumbprint, requiring fast writing. Versions of this technique survived in clerical professions into the modern day and, influenced by Western shorthand methods, some new methods were invented.

=== Europe and North America ===

An interest in shorthand or &quot;short-writing&quot; developed towards the end of the 16th century in England. In 1588, Timothy Bright published his &quot;Characterie; An Arte of Shorte, Swifte and Secrete Writing by Character&quot; which introduced a system with 500 arbitrary symbols each representing one word. Bright&#x27;s book was followed by a number of others, including Peter Bales&#x27; &quot; The Writing Schoolemaster&quot; in 1590, John Willis&#x27;s &quot;Art of Stenography&quot; in 1602, Edmond Willis&#x27;s &quot;An abbreviation of writing by character&quot; in 1618, and Thomas Shelton&#x27;s &quot;Short Writing&quot; in 1626 (later re-issued as &quot;Tachygraphy&quot;).

Shelton&#x27;s system became very popular and is well known because it was used by Samuel Pepys for his diary and for many of his official papers, such as his letter copy books. It was also used by Isaac Newton in some of his notebooks. Shelton borrowed heavily from his predecessors, especially Edmond Willis. Each consonant was represented by an arbitrary but simple symbol, while the five vowels were represented by the relative positions of the surrounding consonants. Thus the symbol for B with symbol for T drawn directly above it represented &quot;bat&quot;, while B with T below it meant &quot;but&quot;; top-right represented &quot;e&quot;, middle-right &quot;i&quot;, and lower-right &quot;o&quot;. A vowel at the end of a word was represented by a dot in the appropriate position, while there were additional symbols for initial vowels. This basic system was supplemented by further symbols representing common prefixes and suffixes.

One drawback of Shelton&#x27;s system was that there was no way to distinguish long and short vowels or diphthongs; so the b-a-t sequence could mean &quot;bat&quot;, or &quot;bait&quot;, or &quot;bate&quot;, while b-o-t might mean &quot;boot&quot;, or &quot;bought&quot;, or &quot;boat&quot;. The reader needed to use the context to work out which alternative was meant. The main advantage of the system was that it was easy to learn and to use. It was popular, and under the two titles of &quot;Short Writing&quot; and &quot;Tachygraphy&quot;, Shelton&#x27;s book ran to more than 20 editions between 1626 and 1710.

Shelton&#x27;s chief rivals were Theophilus Metcalfe&#x27;s &quot;Stenography&quot; or &quot;Short Writing&quot; (1633) which was in its &quot;55th edition&quot; by 1721, and Jeremiah Rich&#x27;s system of 1654, which was published under various titles including &quot;The penns dexterity compleated&quot; (1669). Rich&#x27;s system was used by George Treby chairman of the House of Commons Committee of Secrecy investigating the Popish Plot. Another English shorthand system creator of the 17th century was William Mason (fl. 1672–1709) who published &quot;Arts Advancement&quot; in 1682.

Modern-looking geometric shorthand was introduced with John Byrom&#x27;s &quot;New Universal Shorthand&quot; of 1720. Samuel Taylor published a similar system in 1786, the first English shorthand system to be used all over the English-speaking world. Thomas Gurney published &quot;Brachygraphy&quot; in the mid-18th century. In 1834 in Germany, Franz Xaver Gabelsberger published his Gabelsberger shorthand. Gabelsberger based his shorthand on the shapes used in German cursive handwriting rather than on the geometrical shapes that were common in the English stenographic tradition.
Taylor&#x27;s system was superseded by Pitman shorthand, first introduced in 1837 by English teacher Isaac Pitman, and improved many times since. Pitman&#x27;s system has been used all over the English-speaking world and has been adapted to many other languages, including Latin. Pitman&#x27;s system uses a phonemic orthography. For this reason, it is sometimes known as &quot;phonography&quot;, meaning &quot;sound writing&quot; in Greek. One of the reasons this system allows fast transcription is that vowel sounds are optional when only consonants are needed to determine a word. The availability of a full range of vowel symbols, however, makes complete accuracy possible. Isaac&#x27;s brother Benn Pitman, who lived in Cincinnati, Ohio, was responsible for introducing the method to America. The record for fast writing with Pitman shorthand is 350 wpm during a two-minute test by Nathan Behrin in 1922.

In the United States and some other parts of the world, it was largely superseded by Gregg shorthand, which was first published in 1888 by John Robert Gregg. This system was influenced by the handwriting shapes that Gabelsberger had introduced. Gregg&#x27;s shorthand, like Pitman&#x27;s, is phonetic, but has the simplicity of being &quot;light-line.&quot; Pitman&#x27;s system uses thick and thin strokes to distinguish related sounds, while Gregg&#x27;s uses only thin strokes and makes some of the same distinctions by the length of the stroke. In fact, Gregg claimed joint authorship in another shorthand system published in pamphlet form by one Thomas Stratford Malone; Malone, however, claimed sole authorship and a legal battle ensued. The two systems use very similar, if not identical, symbols; however, these symbols are used to represent different sounds. For instance, on page 10 of the manual is the word d i m &#x27;dim&#x27;; however, in the Gregg system, the spelling would actually mean n u k or &#x27;nook&#x27;.

Andrew J. Graham was a phonotypist operating in the period between the emergence of Pitman&#x27;s and Gregg&#x27;s systems. In 1854 he published a short-lived (only 9 issues) phonotypy journal called &quot;The Cosmotype,&quot; subtitled &quot;devoted to that which will entertain usefully, instruct, and improve humanity&quot;, and several other monographs about phonography. In 1857 he published his own Pitman-like &quot;Graham&#x27;s Brief Longhand&quot; that saw wide adoption in the United States in the late 19th century. He published a translation of the New Testament. His method landed him in a 1864 copyright infringement lawsuit against Benn Pitman in Ohio. Graham died in 1895 and was buried in Montclair&#x27;s Rosedale Cemetery; even as late as 1918 his company Andrew J. Graham &amp; Co continued to market his method.

In his youth, Woodrow Wilson had mastered the Graham system and even corresponded with Graham in Graham. Throughout his life, Wilson continued to develop and employ his own Graham system writing, to the point that by the 1950s, when the Graham method had all but disappeared, Wilson scholars had trouble interpreting his shorthand. In 1960 an 84-year-old anachronistic shorthand expert Clifford Gehman managed to crack Wilson&#x27;s shorthand, demonstrating on a translation of Wilson&#x27;s acceptance speech for the 1912 presidential nomination.

=== Japan ===
There are several other pen shorthands in use (Ishimura, Iwamura, Kumassaki, Kotani, and Nissokuken), leading to a total of nine pen shorthands in use. In addition, there is the Yamane pen shorthand (of unknown importance) and three machine shorthands systems (Speed Waapuro, Caver and Hayatokun or sokutaipu). The machine shorthands have gained some ascendancy over the pen shorthands.

Japanese shorthand systems (&#x27;sokki&#x27; shorthand or &#x27;sokkidou&#x27; stenography) commonly use a syllabic approach, much like the common writing system for Japanese (which has actually two syllabaries in everyday use). There are several semi-cursive systems. Most follow a left-to-right, top-to-bottom writing direction. Several systems incorporate a loop into many of the strokes, giving the appearance of Gregg, Graham, or Cross&#x27;s Eclectic shorthand without actually functioning like them. The Kotani (aka Same-Vowel-Same-Direction or SVSD or V-type) system&#x27;s strokes frequently cross over each other and in so doing form loops.

Japanese also has its own variously cursive form of writing kanji characters, the most extremely simplified of which is known as Sōsho.

The two Japanese syllabaries are themselves adapted from the Chinese characters: both of the syllabaries, katakana and hiragana, are in everyday use alongside the Chinese characters known as kanji; the kanji, being developed in parallel to the Chinese characters, have their own idiosyncrasies, but Chinese and Japanese ideograms are largely comprehensible, even if their use in the languages are not the same.

Prior to the Meiji era, Japanese did not have its own shorthand (the kanji did have their own abbreviated forms borrowed alongside them from China). Takusari Kooki was the first to give classes in a new Western-style non-ideographic shorthand of his own design, emphasis being on the non-ideographic and new. This was the first shorthand system adapted to writing phonetic Japanese, all other systems prior being based on the idea of whole or partial semantic ideographic writing like that used in the Chinese characters, and the phonetic approach being mostly peripheral to writing in general. Even today, Japanese writing uses the syllabaries to pronounce or spell out words, or to indicate grammatical words. Furigana are written alongside kanji, or Chinese characters, to indicate their pronunciation especially in juvenile publications. Furigana are usually written using the hiragana syllabary; foreign words may not have a kanji form and are spelled out using katakana.

The new sokki were used to transliterate popular vernacular story-telling theater (yose) of the day. This led to a thriving industry of sokkibon (shorthand books). The ready availability of the stories in book form, and higher rates of literacy (which the very industry of sokkibon may have helped create, due to these being oral classics that were already known to most people) may also have helped kill the yose theater, as people no longer needed to see the stories performed in person to enjoy them. Sokkibon also allowed a whole host of what had previously been mostly oral rhetorical and narrative techniques into writing, such as imitation of dialect in conversations (which can be found back in older gensaku literature; but gensaku literature used conventional written language in between conversations, however).

== Classification ==

=== Geometric and script-like systems ===
Shorthands that use simplified letterforms are sometimes termed &quot;stenographic&quot; shorthands, contrasting with alphabetic shorthands, below. Stenographic shorthands can be further differentiated by the target letter forms as geometric, script, and semi-script or elliptical.

&quot;Geometric&quot; shorthands are based on circles, parts of circles, and straight lines placed strictly horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The first modern shorthand systems were geometric. Examples include Pitman shorthand, Boyd&#x27;s syllabic shorthand, Samuel Taylor&#x27;s Universal Stenography, the French Prévost-Delaunay, and the Duployé system, adapted to write the Kamloops Wawa (used for Chinook Jargon) writing system.

&quot;Script&quot; shorthands are based on the motions of ordinary handwriting. The first system of this type was published under the title &quot;Cadmus Britanicus&quot; by Simon Bordley, in 1787. However, the first practical system was the German Gabelsberger shorthand of 1834. This class of system is now common in all more recent German shorthand systems, as well as in Austria, Italy, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Russia, other Eastern European countries, and elsewhere.

&quot;Script-geometric&quot;, or &quot;semi-script&quot;, shorthands are based on the ellipse. Semi-script can be considered a compromise between the &quot;geometric&quot; systems and the &quot;script&quot; systems. The first such system was that of George Carl Märes in 1885. However, the most successful system of this type was Gregg shorthand, introduced by John Robert Gregg in 1888. Gregg had studied not only the &quot;geometric&quot; English systems, but also the German Stolze stenography, a &quot;script&quot; shorthand. Other examples include Teeline Shorthand and Thomas Natural Shorthand.

The semi-script philosophy gained popularity in Italy in the first half of the 20th century with three different systems created by Giovanni Vincenzo Cima, Erminio Meschini, and Stenital Mosciaro.

=== Systems resembling standard writing ===
Some shorthand systems attempted to ease learning by using characters from the Latin alphabet. Such non-stenographic systems have often been described as alphabetic, and purists might claim that such systems are not &#x27;true&#x27; shorthand. However, these alphabetic systems do have value for students who cannot dedicate the years necessary to master a stenographic shorthand. Alphabetic shorthands cannot be written at the speeds theoretically possible with symbol systems—200 words per minute or more—but require only a fraction of the time to acquire a useful speed of between 70 and 100 words per minute.

Non-stenographic systems often supplement alphabetic characters by using punctuation marks as additional characters, giving special significance to capitalised letters, and sometimes using additional non-alphabetic symbols. Examples of such systems include Stenoscript, Speedwriting and Forkner shorthand. However, there are some pure alphabetic systems, including Personal Shorthand, SuperWrite, Easy Script Speed Writing, Keyscript Shorthand and Yash3k which limit their symbols to &quot;a priori&quot; alphabetic characters. These have the added advantage that they can also be typed—for instance, onto a computer, PDA, or cellphone. Early editions of Speedwriting were also adapted so that they could be written on a typewriter, and therefore would possess the same advantage.

=== Varieties of vowel representation ===
Shorthand systems can also be classified according to the way that vowels are represented.
* &quot;Alphabetic&quot; – Expression by &quot;normal&quot; vowel signs that are not fundamentally different from consonant signs (e.g., Gregg, Duployan).
* &quot;Mixed alphabetic&quot; – Expression of vowels and consonants by different kinds of strokes (e.g., Arends&#x27; system for German or Melin&#x27;s Swedish Shorthand where vowels are expressed by upward or sideway strokes and consonants and consonant clusters by downward strokes).
* &quot;Abjad&quot; – No expression of the individual vowels at all except for indications of an initial or final vowel (e.g., Taylor).
* &quot;Marked abjad&quot; – Expression of vowels by the use of detached signs (such as dots, ticks, and other marks) written around the consonant signs.
* &quot;Positional abjad&quot; – Expression of an initial vowel by the height of the word in relation to the line, no necessary expression of subsequent vowels (e.g., Pitman, which can optionally express other vowels by detached diacritics).
* &quot;Abugida&quot; – Expression of a vowel by the shape of a stroke, with the consonant indicated by orientation (e.g., Boyd).
* &quot;Mixed abugida&quot; – Expression of the vowels by the width of the joining stroke that leads to the following consonant sign, the height of the following consonant sign in relation to the preceding one, and the line pressure of the following consonant sign (e.g., most German shorthand systems).

=== Machine shorthand systems ===
Traditional shorthand systems are written on paper with a stenographic pencil or a stenographic pen. Some consider that strictly speaking only handwritten systems can be called shorthand.

Machine shorthand is also a common term for writing produced by a stenotype, a specialized keyboard. These are often used for court room transcripts and in live subtitling. However, there are other shorthand machines used worldwide, including: Velotype; Palantype in the UK; Grandjean Stenotype, used extensively in France and French-speaking countries; Michela Stenotype, used extensively in Italy; and Stenokey, used in Bulgaria and elsewhere.

== Common modern English shorthand systems ==
One of the most widely used forms of shorthand is still the Pitman shorthand method described above, which has been adapted for 15 languages. Although Pitman&#x27;s method was extremely popular at first and is still commonly used, especially in the UK, in the U.S., its popularity has been largely superseded by Gregg shorthand, developed by John Robert Gregg in 1888.

In the UK, the spelling-based (rather than phonetic) Teeline shorthand is now more commonly taught and used than Pitman, and Teeline is the recommended system of the National Council for the Training of Journalists with an overall speed of 100 words per minute necessary for certification. Other less commonly used systems in the UK are Pitman 2000, PitmanScript, Speedwriting, and Gregg. Teeline is also the most common shorthand method taught to New Zealand journalists, whose certification typically requires a shorthand speed of at least 80 words per minute.

In Nigeria, shorthand is still taught in higher institutions of learning, especially for students studying Office Technology Management and Business Education.

<text>Uncial is a majuscule script (written entirely in capital letters) commonly used from the 4th to 8th centuries AD by Latin and Greek scribes. Uncial letters were used to write Greek and Latin, as well as Gothic, and are the current style for Coptic and Nobiin.

==Development==

Early uncial script most likely developed from late rustic capitals. Early forms are characterized by broad single-stroke letters using simple round forms taking advantage of the new parchment and vellum surfaces, as opposed to the angular, multiple-stroke letters, which are more suited for rougher surfaces, such as papyrus. In the oldest examples of uncial, such as the fragment of &quot;De bellis macedonicis&quot; in the British Library, of the late 1st–early 2nd centuries, all of the letters are disconnected from one another, and word separation is typically not used. Word separation, however, is characteristic of later uncial usage.

As the script evolved over the centuries, the characters became more complex. Specifically, around AD 600, flourishes and exaggerations of the basic strokes began to appear in more manuscripts. Ascenders and descenders were the first major alterations, followed by twists of the tool in the basic stroke and overlapping. By the time the more compact minuscule scripts arose circa AD 800, some of the evolved uncial styles formed the basis for these simplified, smaller scripts. There are over 500 surviving copies of uncial script; by far the larger number of these predate the Carolingian Renaissance. Uncial was still used, particularly for copies of the Bible, until around the 10th century outside of Ireland. The insular variant of uncial remained the standard script used to write the Irish language until the middle of the 20th century.

==Forms==
In general, there are some common features of uncial script:

* , , , , are relatively narrow.
* , and are relatively broad; is formed with curved strokes (although a straight first stroke may indicate an early script), and is written as to distinguish it from and .
* is formed with a curved stroke, and its arm (or &quot;hasta&quot;) does not connect with the top curve; the height of the arm can also indicate the age of the script (written in a high position, the script is probably early, while an arm written closer to the middle of the curve may indicate a later script).
* has a small base, not extending to the right to connect with the next letter.
* has a long, curved shoulder , often connecting with the next letter.
* resembles (and is the ancestor of) the &quot;long s&quot; ; in uncial it looks more like than .

In later uncial scripts, the letters are sometimes drawn haphazardly; for example, runs together at the baseline, bows (for example in , , ) do not entirely curve in to touch their stems, and the script is generally not written as cleanly as previously.

==National styles==
Due to its extremely widespread use, in Byzantine, African, Italian, French, Spanish, and &quot;insular&quot; (Irish, Welsh, and English) centres, there were many slightly different styles in use:

*African (i.e. Roman North African) uncial is more angular than other forms of uncial. In particular, the bow of the letter is particularly sharp and pointed.
*Byzantine uncial has two variants, each with unique features: &quot;b-d uncial&quot; uses forms of and which are closer to half-uncial (see below), and was in use in the 4th and 5th centuries; &quot;b-r&quot; uncial, in use in the 5th and 6th centuries, has a form of that is twice as large as the other letters, and an with a bow resting on the baseline and the stem extending below the baseline.
*Italian uncial has flatter tops on the round letters (, , etc.), and a sharp bow (as in African uncial), an almost horizontal rather than vertical stem in , and forked finials (i.e., serifs in some letters such as , , and ).
*Insular uncial (not to be confused with the separate Insular script) generally has definite word separation, and accent marks over stressed syllables, probably because Irish scribes did not speak a language descended from Latin. They also use specifically Insular scribal abbreviations not found in other uncial forms, use wedge-shaped finials, connect a slightly subscript &quot;pendant &quot; with or (when at the end of a word), and decorate the script with animals and dots (&quot;Insular dotting&quot;, often in groups of three).
*French (that is, Merovingian) uncial uses thin descenders (in , etc.), an with lines that cross higher than the middle, and a with a curled stem (somewhat resembling an apple), and there are many decorations of fish, trees, and birds.
*Cyrillic manuscript developed from Greek uncial in the late ninth century (mostly replacing the Glagolitic alphabet), and was originally used to write the Old Church Slavonic liturgical language. The earlier form was called &quot;ustav&quot; (predominant in the 11–14th centuries), and later developed into &quot;semi-ustav&quot; script (or &quot;poluustav&quot;, 15–16th centuries).

==Etymology==
There is some doubt about the original meaning of the word. &quot;Uncial&quot; itself probably comes from St. Jerome&#x27;s preface to the Book of Job, where it is found in the form &quot;uncialibus&quot;, but it is possible that this is a misreading of &quot;inicialibus&quot; (though this makes little sense in the context), and Jerome may have been referring to the larger initial letters found at the beginning of paragraphs.
:&quot;Habeant qui volunt veteres libros, vel in membranis purpureis auro argentoque descriptos, vel uncialibus ut vulgo aiunt litteris onera magis exarata quam codices.&quot;
:&quot;Let those who so desire have old books, or books written in gold and silver on purple parchment, or burdens {rather than books} written in uncial letters, as they are popularly called.&quot;

In classical Latin &quot;uncialis&quot; could mean both &quot;inch-high&quot; and &quot;weighing an ounce&quot;, and it is possible that Jerome was punning on this; he may conceivably also have been playing with the other meaning of &quot;codex&quot;, &quot;block of wood&quot;.

The term &quot;uncial&quot; in the sense of describing this script was first used by Jean Mabillon in the early 18th century. Thereafter his definition was refined by Scipione Maffei, who used it to refer to this script as distinct from Roman square capitals.

==Other uses==

The word, &quot;uncial&quot;, is also sometimes used to refer to manuscripts that have been scribed in uncial, especially when differentiating from those penned with minuscule. Some of the most noteworthy Greek uncials are:
* Codex Sinaiticus
* Codex Vaticanus
* Codex Alexandrinus
*: – these being three of what are often called the four great uncial codices
* Codex Bezae
* Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus

The Petropolitanus is considered by some to contain optimum uncial style. It is also an example of how large the characters were getting.

For further details on these manuscripts, see Guglielmo Cavallo &quot;Ricerche sulla Maiuscola Biblica&quot; (Florence, 1967).

Modern calligraphy usually teaches a form of evolved Latin-based uncial hand that would probably be best compared to the later 7th to 10th century examples, though admittedly, the variations in Latin uncial are much wider and less rigid than Greek. Modern uncial has borrowed heavily from some of the conventions found in more cursive scripts, using flourishes, variable width strokes, and on occasion, even center axis tilt.

In a way comparable to the continued widespread use of the blackletter typefaces for written German until well into the 20th century, Gaelic letterforms, which are similar to uncial letterforms, were conventionally used for typography in Irish until the 1950s. The script is still widely used in this way for titles of documents, inscriptions on monuments, and other &#x27;official&#x27; uses. Strictly speaking, the Gaelic script is insular, not uncial. Uncial Greek (commonly called &quot;Byzantine lettering&quot; by Greeks themselves) is commonly used by the Greek Orthodox Church and various institutions and individuals in Greece to this day. The Modern Greek State has also used uncial script on several occasions in official capacity (such as on seals, government documents, etc.) as did many of the Greek provisional governments during the Greek War of Independence. The height of uncial usage by the Modern Greek State was during the Greek military junta of 1967–74, when even Greek Drachma coins had uncial lettering on them. Since the Metapolitefsi, the Greek State has stopped using uncial script.

==Half-uncial==
The term &quot;half-uncial&quot; or &quot;semi-uncial&quot; was first deployed by Scipione Maffei, &quot;Istoria diplomatica&quot; (Mantua, 1727); he used it to distinguish what seemed like a cut-down version of uncial in the famous &quot;Codex Basilicanus&quot; of Hilary, which contains sections in each of the two types of script. The terminology was continued in the mid-18th century by René Prosper Tassin and Charles François Toustain.

Despite the common and well-fixed usage, half-uncial is a poor name to the extent that it suggests some organic debt to regular uncial, though both types share features inherited from their ancient source, capitalis rustica. 

It was first used around the 3rd century (if we don&#x27;t consider its earliest example a transitional variant of the rustic script, as Leonard Boyle did) and remained in use until the end of the 8th century. The early forms of half-uncial were used for pagan authors and Roman legal writing, while in the 6th century the script came to be used in Africa and Europe (but not as often in insular centres) to transcribe Christian texts.

===Half-uncial forms===
Some general forms of half-uncial letters are:
* is usually round , sometimes with a slightly open top
* and have vertical stems, identical to the modern letters
* has a flat top, no bow, and a curved descender (somewhat resembling the digit 5)
* has a curved shaft 
* , , and are similar to their uncial counterparts (with the same differences compared to modern letters)

Half-uncial was brought to Ireland in the 5th century, and from there to England in the 7th century. In England, it was used to create the Old English Latin alphabet in the 8th century.

<text>Variable bitrate (VBR) is a term used in telecommunications and computing that relates to the bitrate used in sound or video encoding. As opposed to constant bitrate (CBR), VBR files vary the amount of output data per time segment. VBR allows a higher bitrate (and therefore more storage space) to be allocated to the more complex segments of media files while less space is allocated to less complex segments. The average of these rates can be calculated to produce an average bitrate for the file.

MP3, WMA and AAC audio files can optionally be encoded in VBR, while Opus and Vorbis are encoded in VBR by default. Variable bit rate encoding is also commonly used on MPEG-2 video, MPEG-4 Part 2 video (Xvid, DivX, etc.), MPEG-4 Part 10/H.264 video, Theora, Dirac and other video compression formats. Additionally, variable rate encoding is inherent in lossless compression schemes such as FLAC and Apple Lossless.

==Advantages and disadvantages of VBR==
The advantages of VBR are that it produces a better quality-to-space ratio compared to a CBR file of the same data. The bits available are used more flexibly to encode the sound or video data more accurately, with fewer bits used in less demanding passages and more bits used in difficult-to-encode passages.

The disadvantages are that it may take more time to encode, as the process is more complex, and that some hardware might not be compatible with VBR files.

==Methods of VBR encoding==

===Multi-pass encoding and single-pass encoding===
VBR is created using so-called &quot;single-pass encoding&quot; or &quot;multi-pass encoding&quot;. Single-pass encoding analyzes and encodes the data &quot;on the fly&quot; and it is also used in constant bitrate encoding. Single-pass encoding is used when the encoding speed is most important — e.g. for real-time encoding. Single-pass VBR encoding is usually controlled by the &quot;fixed quality&quot; setting or by the &quot;bitrate range&quot; (minimum and maximum allowed bitrate) or by the &quot;average bitrate&quot; setting. Multi-pass encoding is used when the encoding quality is most important. Multi-pass encoding cannot be used in real-time encoding, live broadcast or live streaming. Multi-pass encoding takes much longer than single-pass encoding, because every pass means one pass through the input data (usually through the whole input file). Multi-pass encoding is used only for VBR encoding, because CBR encoding doesn&#x27;t offer any flexibility to change the bitrate. The most common multi-pass encoding is two-pass encoding. In the first pass of two-pass encoding, the input data is being analyzed and the result is stored in a log file. In the second pass, the collected data from the first pass is used to achieve the best encoding quality. In a video encoding, two-pass encoding is usually controlled by the average bitrate setting or by the bitrate range setting (minimal and maximal allowed bitrate) or by the target video file size setting.

===Bitrate range===
This VBR encoding method allows the user to specify a bitrate range — a minimum and/or maximum allowed bitrate. Some encoders extend this method with an average bitrate. The minimum and maximum allowed bitrate set bounds in which the bitrate may vary. The disadvantage of this method is that the average bitrate (and hence file size) will not be known ahead of time. The bitrate range is also used in some fixed quality encoding methods, but usually without permission to change a particular bitrate.

===Average bitrate===
The disadvantage of single pass ABR encoding (with or without Constrained Variable Bitrate) is the opposite of fixed quantizer VBR — the size of the output is known ahead of time, but the resulting quality is unknown, although still better than CBR.

The multi-pass ABR encoding is more similar to fixed quantizer VBR, because a higher average will really increase the quality.

===File size===
VBR encoding using the file size setting is usually multi-pass encoding. It allows the user to specify a specific target file size. In the first pass, the encoder analyzes the input file and automatically calculates possible bitrate range and/or average bitrate. In the last pass, the encoder distributes the available bits among the entire video to achieve uniform quality.

<text>The Codex Vaticanus (The Vatican, Bibl. Vat., Vat. gr. 1209), is a manuscript of the Greek Bible, containing the majority of the Old Testament and the majority of the New Testament. It is designated by siglum B or 03 in the Gregory-Aland numbering of New Testament manuscripts, and as δ 1 in the von Soden numbering of New Testament manuscripts. It is one of the four great uncial codices. Along with Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Sinaiticus, it is one of the earliest and most complete manuscripts of the Bible. Using the study of comparative writing styles (palaeography), it has been dated to the 4th century.

The manuscript became known to Western scholars as a result of correspondence between textual critic Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus (known usually as Erasmus) and the prefects of the Vatican Library. Portions of the codex were collated by several scholars, but numerous errors were made during this process. The codex&#x27;s relationship to the Latin Vulgate and the value Jerome placed on it is unclear. In the 19th century transcriptions of the full codex were completed. It was at that point that scholars became more familiar with the text and how it differed from the more common Textus Receptus (a critical edition of the Greek New Testament based on earlier editions by Erasmus).

Most current scholars consider Codex Vaticanus to be one of the most important Greek witnesses to the Greek text of the New Testament, followed by Codex Sinaiticus. Until the discovery by Tischendorf of Sinaiticus, Vaticanus was considered to be unrivalled. It was extensively used by textual critics Brooke F. Westcott and Fenton J. A. Hort in their edition of &quot;The New Testament in the Original Greek&quot; in 1881. The most widely sold editions of the Greek New Testament are largely based on the text of the Codex Vaticanus. Codex Vaticanus &quot;is rightly considered to be the oldest extant copy of the Bible.&quot;

The codex is named after its place of conservation in the Vatican Library, where it has been kept since at least the 15th century.

== Description ==

The manuscript is a codex (precursor to the modern book) in quarto volume, written on 759 leaves of fine and thin vellum (sized , although originally bigger), in uncial letters, arranged in quires of five sheets or ten leaves each, similar to Codex Marchalianus or Codex Rossanensis; but unlike Codex Sinaiticus which has an arrangement of four or three sheets. The number of the quires is often found in the margin. Originally it must have been composed of 830 parchment leaves, but it appears that 71 leaves have been lost. The Old Testament currently consists of 617 sheets and the New Testament of 142 sheets. The codex is written in three columns per page, with 40–44 lines per column, and 16–18 letters per line. In the poetical books of the Old Testament (OT) there are only two columns to a page. There are 44 lines in a column in the Pentateuch (first five books of the OT), Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and 1 Kings 1:1–19:11; in 2 Chronicles 10:16–26:13 there are 40 lines in a column; and in the New Testament always 42.
The manuscript is one of the very few New Testament manuscripts to be written with three columns per page. The other two Greek codices written in that way are Uncial 048 and Uncial 053.

The Greek lettering in the codex is written continuously in small and neat letters. All the letters are equally distant from each other; no word is separated from the other, with each line appearing to be one long word. Punctuation is rare (accents and breathings have been added by a later hand) except for some blank spaces, diaeresis on initial iotas and upsilons, abbreviations of the &quot;nomina sacra&quot; (abbreviations of certain words and names considered sacred in Christianity) and markings of OT citations. The first letter of a new chapter sometimes protrudes a little from the column. The OT citations were marked by an inverted &quot;comma&quot; or &quot;diplai&quot; (&gt;). There are no enlarged initials; no stops or accents; no divisions into chapters or sections such as are found in later manuscripts.

The text of the Gospels is not divided according to the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons, but is divided into peculiar numbered sections: Matthew has 170, Mark 61, Luke 152, and John 80. This system is only found in two other manuscripts: Codex Zacynthius and Minuscule 579. There are two system divisions in the Acts and the Catholic Epistles which differ from the Euthalian Apparatus. In Acts, these sections are 36 (the same system as Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Amiatinus, and Codex Fuldensis) and according to the other system 69 sections. The chapters in the Pauline epistles are numbered continuously as the Epistles were regarded as comprising one book.

==Text==

=== Text-type ===
In the Old Testament, the type of text varies, with a received text in Ezekiel and a rejected one in the Book of Isaiah. In Judges the text differs substantially from that of the majority of manuscripts, but agrees with the Old Latin, Sahidic version and Cyril of Alexandria. In Job, it has the additional 400 half-verses from Theodotion, which are not in the Old Latin and Sahidic versions. The text of the Old Testament was considered by critics, such as Hort and Cornill, to be substantially that which underlies Origen&#x27;s Hexapla edition, completed by him at Caesarea and issued as an independent work (apart from the other versions with which Origen associated it) by Eusebius and Pamphilus.

In the New Testament, the Greek text of the codex is considered a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. It has been found to agree very closely with the text of Bodmer in the Gospels of Luke and John. has been dated to the beginning of the 3rd century, and hence is at least 100 years older than the Codex Vaticanus itself. This is purported to demonstrate (by recourse to a postulated earlier exemplar from which both and B descend) that Vaticanus accurately reproduces an earlier text from these two biblical books, which reinforces the reputation the codex held amongst Biblical scholars. It also strongly suggests that it may have been copied in Egypt. In the Pauline epistles there is a distinctly Western element. Textual critic Kurt Aland placed it in Category I of his New Testament manuscript classification system. Category 1 manuscripts are described as &quot;of a very special quality, i.e., manuscripts with a very high proportion of the early text, presumably the original text, which has not been preserved in its purity in any one manuscript.&quot;

=== Contents ===

The codex originally contained a virtually complete copy of the Greek Old Testament (known as the Septuagint / LXX), lacking only 1-4 Maccabees and the Prayer of Manasseh. The original 20 leaves containing Genesis 1:1–46:28a (31 leaves) and Psalm 105:27–137:6b have been lost. These were replaced by pages transcribed by a later hand in the 15th century. 2 Kings 2:5–7, 10–13 are also lost due to a tear to one of the pages. The order of the Old Testament books in the codex is as follows: Genesis to 2 Chronicles as normal; 1 Esdras; 2 Esdras (Ezra–Nehemiah); the Psalms; Proverbs; Ecclesiastes; Song of Songs; Job; Wisdom; Ecclesiasticus; Esther; Judith; Tobit; the minor prophets from Hosea to Malachi (but in the order: Hosea, Amos, Micah, Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi); Isaiah; Jeremiah; Baruch; Lamentations and the Epistle of Jeremiah; Ezekiel and Daniel. This order differs from that followed in Codex Alexandrinus.

The extant New Testament portion contains the Gospels, Acts, the general epistles, the Pauline epistles, and the Epistle to the Hebrews (up to Hebrews 9:14, καθα[ριει); it is lacking 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and Revelation. The missing part of Hebrews and Revelation were supplemented by a 15th-century minuscule hand (folios 760–768), and are catalogued separately as minuscule 1957. It is possible some apocryphal books from the New Testament were included at the end (as in codices Sinaiticus and Alexandrinus). It is also possible that Revelation was not included.

== History ==
=== Provenance ===
The provenance and early history of the codex are uncertain; Rome (Hort), southern Italy, Alexandria (Kenyon,), and Caesarea (T. C. Skeat; Burkitt) have been suggested as possible origins. Hort based his argument for Rome mainly on certain spellings of proper names, such as and , which show a Western or Latin influence. A second argument was the chapter division in Acts, similar to the ones in Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, is not found in any other Greek manuscript, but is present in several manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate. Robinson cautiously suggests however, the system of chapter divisions was introduced into the Vulgate by Jerome himself, due to his studies at Caesarea. Hort also postulated the codex was copied from a manuscript whose line length was 12–14 letters per line, as when the codex&#x27;s scribe made large omissions, they were typically 12–14 letters long.

Kenyon suggested the manuscript originated in Alexandria: &quot;It is noteworthy that the section numeration of the Pauline Epistles in B shows that it was copied from a manuscript in which the Epistle to the Hebrews was placed between Galatians and Ephesians—an arrangement which elsewhere occurs only in the Sahidic version.&quot; Kenyon also suggested the order of the Pauline epistles indicates a connection with Egypt, and as in Codex Alexandrinus, the titles of some of the books contain letters of a distinctively Coptic character, particularly the Coptic mu (which was also frequently seen at the ends of lines where space has to be economized). According to Metzger, &quot;the similarity of its text in significant portions of both Testaments with the Coptic versions and with Greek papyri, and the style of writing (notably the Coptic forms used in some of the titles) point rather to Egypt and Alexandria&quot;.

It has been postulated the codex was at one time in the possession of Cardinal Bessarion, because the minuscule supplement has a text similar to one of Bessarion&#x27;s manuscripts. T. C. Skeat believed Bessarion&#x27;s mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople John Chortasmenos, had the book brought to Rome from Constantinople around the time of the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Paul Canart argued the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration found in the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light of the way they appear in connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel. T. C. Skeat first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the 50 Bibles that the Emperor Constantine I ordered Eusebius of Caesarea to produce.

The codex is generally assigned to the middle of the fourth century and considered contemporary or slightly earlier than Codex Sinaiticus, which can be dated with a reasonable degree of confidence between the early fourth century and the early fifth century.

=== Scribes and correctors ===

According to Tischendorf the manuscript was written by three scribes (A, B, C), two of whom appear to have written the Old Testament and one the entire New Testament. Tischendorf&#x27;s view was accepted by Frederic G. Kenyon, but contested by T. C. Skeat, who examined the codex more thoroughly. Skeat and other paleographers contested Tischendorf&#x27;s theory of a third (C) scribe, instead asserting two scribes worked on the Old Testament (A and B) and one of them (B) wrote the New Testament.

Scribe A wrote:
: Genesis – 1 Kings (pages 41–334)
: Psalms – Tobias (pages 625–944)
Scribe B wrote:
: 1 Kings – 2 Esdra (pages 335–624)
: Hosea – Daniel (pages 945–1234)
: New Testament.

Two correctors have been suggested as working on the manuscript, one (B) was contemporary with the scribes, the other (B) worked in about the 10th or 11th century. The theory of a first corrector, B, proposed by Tischendorf was rejected by later scholars. According to Tischendorf, one of the scribes is identical to (and may have been) one of the scribes of Codex Sinaiticus (scribe D), but there is insufficient evidence for his assertion. Skeat agreed that the writing style is very similar to that of Codex Sinaiticus, but there is not enough evidence to accept the scribes were identical: &quot;the identity of the scribal tradition stands beyond dispute&quot;.

The original writing was retraced by a later scribe (usually dated to the 10th or 11th century), and the beauty of the original script was spoiled. Accents, breathing marks, and punctuation were added by a later hand. There are no enlarged initials, no divisions into chapters or sections such as are found in later manuscripts, but a different system of division peculiar to this manuscript. There are plenty itacistic faults, especially the interchange of ει for ι and αι for ε. The exchange of ο for ω is less frequent.

The manuscript contains unusual small horizontally aligned double dots (so called &quot;distigmai&quot;, formerly called &quot;umlauts&quot;) in the column margins and are scattered throughout the New Testament. There are 795 of these clearly seen in the text, and perhaps another 40 that are undetermined. The date of these markings are disputed among scholars. Two such distigmai can be seen in the left margin of the first column (top image). Tischendorf reflected upon their meaning, but without any resolution. He pointed on several places where these distigmai were used: at the ending of the Gospel of Mark, 1 Thess 2:14; 5:28; Heb 4:16; 8:1. The meaning of these distigmai was recognized in 1995 by Philip Payne. Payne discovered the first distigme while studying the section 1 Cor 14.34–35 of the codex. He suggested that distigmai indicate lines where another textual variant was known to the person who wrote the umlauts. Therefore, the distigmai mark places of textual uncertainty.
The same distigmai were observed in Codex Fuldensis, especially in the section containing 1 Cor 14:34–35. The distigme of two codices indicate a variant of the Western manuscripts, which placed 1 Cor 14:34–35 after 1 Cor 14:40 (manuscripts: Claromontanus, Augiensis, Boernerianus, 88, it, and some manuscripts of Vulgate).

On page 1512, next to Hebrews 1:3, the text contains a marginal note, &quot;&quot;Fool and knave, leave the old reading and do not change it!&quot; – &quot;&quot;&quot; which may suggest unauthorised correcting was a recognized problem in scriptoriums.

== In the Vatican Library ==
The manuscript is believed to have been housed in Caesarea in the 6th century, together with Codex Sinaiticus, as they have the same unique division of chapters in Acts. It came to Italy, probably from Constantinople, after the Council of Florence (1438–1445).

The manuscript has been housed in the Vatican Library (founded by Pope Nicholas V in 1448) for as long as it has been known, possibly appearing in the library&#x27;s earliest catalog of 1475 (with shelf number 1209), but definitely appearing in the 1481 catalog. In the catalog from 1481 it was described as a &quot;Biblia in tribus columnis ex membranis in rubeo&quot; (three-column vellum Bible).

=== Collations ===
In the 16th century, Western scholars became aware of the manuscript as a consequence of the correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus&#x27;s New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now ).

Giulio Bartolocci, librarian of the Vatican, produced a collation in 1669 which was not published; it was never used until a copy of it was found in the Royal Library at Paris by Scholz in 1819. This collation was imperfect and revised in 1862. Another collation was made in 1720 for Bentley by Mico, then revised by Rulotta, which was not published until 1799. Bentley was stirred by Mill&#x27;s claim of 30,000 variants in the New Testament and he wanted to reconstruct the text of the New Testament in its early form. He felt that among the manuscripts of the New Testament, Codex Alexandrinus was &quot;the oldest and best in the world&quot;. Bentley understood the necessity to use manuscripts if he were to reconstruct an older form than that apparent in Codex Alexandrinus. He assumed that by supplementing this manuscript with readings from other Greek manuscripts, and from the Latin Vulgate, he could triangulate back to a single recension which he presumed existed at the time of the First Council of Nicaea. He therefore required a collation from Vaticanus. The text of the collation was irreconcilable with Codex Alexandrinus and he abandoned the project.

A further collation was made by scholar Andrew Birch, who, in 1798, in Copenhagen, edited some textual variants of the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles, in 1800 for the Book of Revelation, in 1801 for the Gospels. They were incomplete and included together with the textual variants from the other manuscripts. Many of them were false. Andrew Birch reproached Mill and Wettstein, that they &quot;falso citatur Vaticanus&quot; (cite Vaticanus incorrectly), and gave as an example Luke 2:38 – Ισραηλ [Israel] instead of Ιερουσαλημ [Jerusalem]. The reading Ισραηλ could be found in the codex 130, housed at the Vatican Library, under shelf number Vat. gr. 359.

Before the 19th century, no scholar was allowed to study or edit the Codex Vaticanus, and scholars did not ascribe any value to it; in fact, it was suspected to have been interpolated by the Latin textual tradition. John Mill wrote in his &quot;Prolegomena&quot; (1707): &quot;in Occidentalium gratiam a Latino scriba exaratum&quot; (&quot;written by a Latin scribe for the western world&quot;). He did not believe there was value to having a collation for the manuscript. Wettstein would have liked to know the readings of the codex, but not because he thought that they could have been of any help to him for difficult textual decisions. According to him, this codex had no authority whatsoever (&quot;sed ut vel hoc constaret, Codicem nullus esse auctoris&quot;). In 1751 Wettstein produced the first list of the New Testament manuscripts, Codex Vaticanus received symbol B (because of its age) and took second position on this list (Alexandrinus received A, Ephraemi – C, Bezae – D, etc.) until the discovery of Codex Sinaiticus (designated by א).

Griesbach produced a list of nine manuscripts which were to be assigned to the Alexandrian text: C, L, K, 1, 13, 33, 69, 106, and 118. Codex Vaticanus was not in this list. In the second (1796) edition of his Greek NT, Griesbach added Codex Vaticanus as a witness to the Alexandrian text in Mark, Luke, and John. He still believed the first half of Matthew represented the Western text-type.

=== Editions of text of the codex ===

In 1799, as a result of the Treaty of Tolentino, the manuscript was sent to Paris as a victory trophy for Napoleon, but in 1815 it was returned to the Vatican Library. During that time, German scholar Johann Leonhard Hug (1765–1846) saw it in Paris. Together with other worthy treasures of the Vatican, Hug examined it, but he did not perceive the need of a new and full collation.

Cardinal Angelo Mai prepared the first typographical facsimile edition between 1828 and 1838, which did not appear until 1857, three years after his death, and which was considered unsatisfactory. It was issued in 5 volumes (1–4 volumes for the Old Testament, 5 volume for the New Testament). All lacunae of the codex were supplemented. Lacunae in the Acts and Pauline epistles were supplemented from the codex Vaticanus 1761, the whole text of Revelation from Vaticanus 2066, and the text of Mark 16:8–20 from Vaticanus Palatinus 220. Verses not included by codex as Matthew 12:47; Mark 15:28; Luke 22:43–44; 23:17.34; John 5:3.4; 7:53–8:11; 1 Peter 5:3; 1 John 5:7 were supplemented from popular Greek printed editions. The number of errors was extraordinarily high, and also no attention was paid to distinguish readings of the first hand versus correctors. There was no detailed examination of the manuscript&#x27;s characteristics. As a consequence, this edition was deemed inadequate for critical purposes. An improved edition was published in 1859, which became the source of Bultmann&#x27;s 1860 NT.

In 1843 Tischendorf was permitted to make a facsimile of a few verses, in 1844 Eduard de Muralt saw it, and in 1845 S. P. Tregelles was allowed to observe several points which Muralt had overlooked. He often saw the codex, but &quot;it was under such restrictions that it was impossible to do more than examine particular readings&quot;.

&quot;They would not let me open it without searching my pockets, and depriving me of pen, ink, and paper; and at the same time two prelati kept me in constant conversation in Latin, and if I looked at a passage too long, they would snatch the book out of my hand&quot;.
Tregelles left Rome after five months without accomplishing his purpose. During a large part of the 19th century, the authorities of the Vatican Library obstructed scholars who wished to study the codex in detail. Henry Alford in 1849 wrote: &quot;It has never been published in facsimile (!) nor even thoroughly collated (!!).&quot; Scrivener in 1861 commented:

&quot;Codex Vaticanus 1209 is probably the oldest large vellum manuscript in existence, and is the glory of the great Vatican Library in Rome. To these legitimate sources of deep interest must be added the almost romantic curiosity which has been excited by the jealous watchfulness of its official guardians, with whom an honest zeal for its safe preservation seems to have now degenerated into a species of capricious wilfulness, and who have shewn a strange incapacity for making themselves the proper use of a treasure they scarcely permit others more than to gaze upon&quot;. It (...) &quot;is so jealously guarded by the Papal authorities that ordinary visitors see nothing of it but the red Morocco binding&quot;.
Thomas Law Montefiore (1862):

&quot;The history of the Codex Vaticanus B, No. 1209, is the history in miniature of Romish jealousy and exclusiveness.&quot;

Burgon was permitted to examine the codex for an hour and a half in 1860, consulting 16 different passages. Burgon was a defender of the Traditional Text and for him Codex Vaticanus, as well as codices Sinaiticus and Bezae, were the most corrupt documents extant. He felt that each of these three codices &quot;clearly exhibits a fabricated text – is the result of arbitrary and reckless recension.&quot; The two most widely respected of these three codices, א and B, he likens to the &quot;two false witnesses&quot; of Matthew 26:60.
In 1861, Henry Alford collated and verified doubtful passages (in several imperfect collations), which he published in facsimile editions complete with errors. Until he began his work he met unexpected hindrances. He received a special order from Cardinal Antonelli &quot;per verificare&quot;, to verify passages, but this license was interpreted by the librarian to mean that he was to see the book, but not to use it. In 1862, secretary of Alford, Mr. Cure, continued Alford&#x27;s work. For some reason which does not clearly appear, the authorities of the Vatican Library put continual obstacles in the way of all who wished to study it in detail, one of which was the Vatican Library was only opened for three hours a day. In 1867 Tischendorf published the text of the New Testament of the codex on the basis of Mai&#x27;s edition. It was the &quot;most perfect edition of the manuscript which had yet appeared&quot;.

In 1868–1881 C. Vercellone, Giuseppe Cozza-Luzi, and G. Sergio published an edition of the entire codex in 6 volumes (New Testament in volume V; Prolegomena in volume VI). A typographical facsimile appeared between 1868 and 1872. In 1889–1890 a photographic facsimile of the entire manuscript was made and published by Cozza-Luzi, in three volumes. Another facsimile of the New Testament text was published in 1904–1907 in Milan. As a result, the codex became widely available.

In 1999, the Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato in Rome (the Italian State Printing House and Mint) published a limited edition, full-color, exact scale facsimile of Codex Vaticanus. The facsimile reproduces the very form of the pages of the original manuscript, complete with the distinctive individual shape of each page, including holes in the vellum. It has an additional &quot;Prolegomena&quot; volume with gold and silver impressions of 74 pages.

, a digitised copy of the codex is available online from the Vatican Library.

== Importance ==

Codex Vaticanus is considered as one of the most important manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, &quot;The New Testament in the Original Greek&quot; (1881), and it was the basis for their text. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden&#x27;s editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort.

According to the commonly accepted opinion of the textual critics, it is the most important witness of the text of the Gospels, in the Acts and Catholic epistles, with a stature equal to Codex Sinaiticus, although in the Pauline epistles it includes Western readings and the value of the text is somewhat less than the Codex Sinaiticus. The manuscript is not complete. Aland notes: &quot;B is by far the most significant of the uncials&quot;.

<text>Philip Edward Hartman (; September 24, 1948 – May 28, 1998) was a Canadian-American comedian, actor, screenwriter and graphic designer. Hartman was born in Brantford, Ontario, and his family moved to the United States when he was ten years old. After graduating from California State University, Northridge, with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands including Poco and America. In 1975, Hartman joined the comedy group the Groundlings, where he helped Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the film &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; and made recurring appearances as Captain Carl on Reubens&#x27; show &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;.

In 1986, Hartman joined the NBC sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) as a cast member and stayed for eight seasons until 1994. Nicknamed &quot;Glue&quot; for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for his &quot;SNL&quot; work in 1989. He also starred as Bill McNeal in the sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, voiced Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and appeared in supporting roles in the films &quot;Quick Change&quot; (1990), &quot;Greedy&quot; (1994), &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; (1996), and &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; (1998).

After two divorces, Hartman married Brynn Omdahl in 1987, with whom he had two children. Their marriage was troubled due to Phil&#x27;s busy work schedule and Brynn&#x27;s drug and alcohol abuse. In 1998, while Phil was sleeping in his bed, Brynn shot and killed him, and later killed herself. In the weeks following his murder, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Hartman was &quot;the last person you&#x27;d expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with&quot;. He was posthumously inducted into the Canada and Hollywood Walks of Fame in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

==Early life==

Phil Hartman was born Philip Edward Hartmann (later dropping one &quot;n&quot;) on September 24, 1948, in Brantford, Ontario. He was the fourth of eight children of Doris Marguerite (&quot;née&quot; Wardell; July 17, 1919 – April 15, 2001) and Rupert Loebig Hartmann (November 8, 1914 – April 30, 1998), who sold building materials. The family was Catholic. As a child, Hartman found affection hard to earn: &quot;I suppose I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted out of my family life, so I started seeking love and attention elsewhere.&quot;

Hartman was 10 years old when his family moved to the United States. They first lived in Lewiston, Maine, then Meriden, Connecticut, and then on the West Coast, where he attended Westchester High School and frequently acted as the class clown. After graduating, he studied art at Santa Monica City College, dropping out in 1969 to become a roadie with a rock band. He returned to school in 1972 to study graphic arts at California State University, Northridge. He developed and operated his own graphic art business, creating more than 40 album covers for bands including Poco and America, as well as advertising and the logo for Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. In the late 1970s, he made his first television appearance on an episode of &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, where he won.

==Career==

===The Groundlings and Pee-Wee Herman (1975–1985)===
Working alone as a graphic artist, Hartman frequently amused himself with &quot;flights of voice fantasies&quot;. In 1975, seeking a more social outlet for his talents, he began attending evening comedy classes by the California-based improvisational comedy group The Groundlings. While watching one of their performances, he impulsively decided to climb on stage and join the cast. His first onscreen appearance was in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Stunt Rock&quot;, an Australian film directed in Los Angeles by Brian Trenchard-Smith. After several years of training, paying his way by redesigning the group&#x27;s logo and merchandise, Hartman formally joined The Groundlings and by 1979 was one of the show&#x27;s stars.

There Hartman befriended Paul Reubens, with whom he often collaborated on comedic material. Together they created the character Pee-wee Herman and developed &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;, a live stage show that subsequently aired on HBO in 1981. Hartman played Captain Carl in the show, and reprised the role for the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. Reubens and Hartman made cameos in the 1980 film &quot;Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Next Movie&quot;. Hartman co-wrote the script of the 1985 feature film &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; and had a cameo role as a reporter. He had considered quitting acting at the age of 36 due to the challenges of finding work; but the success of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; changed his mind. After a creative disagreement with Reubens, he left the Pee-Wee Herman project to pursue other roles.

Hartman took more small roles in 1986 films such as &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; and &quot;Three Amigos&quot;. He also worked as a voice actor in animated television programs, including &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;Challenge of the GoBots&quot;, &quot;The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo,&quot; and in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; as Henry Mitchell and George Wilson and most of the adult male characters. After season 1, Hartman (who by this point had joined the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;) was replaced by Maurice LaMarche. He developed a strong persona providing voice-overs for advertisements.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1986–1994)===
Hartman successfully auditioned to join NBC&#x27;s variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) in its 12th season, which began on October 11, 1986. He had been recommended for the show by fellow Groundlings and &quot;SNL&quot; cast members Jon Lovitz and Laraine Newman, as well as &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; director Penny Marshall. He told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;I wanted to do [&quot;SNL&quot;] because I wanted to get the exposure that would give me box-office credibility so I can write movies for myself.&quot; In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman&#x27;s original &quot;SNL&quot; characters include Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef and Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. His impressions include Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, Charlton Heston, Kelsey Grammer, Michael Caine, Oliver Stone, Phil Donahue, Telly Savalas, Barry Humphries, Kirk Douglas and Bill Clintonthe latter considered his best-known impression.

Hartman first performed his Clinton impression on an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. When he met Clinton in 1993, Hartman remarked, &quot;I guess I owe you a few apologies&quot;, adding later that he &quot;sometimes [felt] a twinge of guilt about [his Clinton impression]&quot;. Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: &quot;You&#x27;re not the president, but you play one on TV. And you&#x27;re OK, mostly.&quot; Hartman copied the president&#x27;s &quot;post-nasal drip&quot; and the &quot;slight scratchiness&quot; in his voice, as well as his open, &quot;less intimidating&quot; hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he thought it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter, and used makeup to highlight his nose. In one of Hartman&#x27;s sketches as Clinton, the president-elect visits a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant and explains his economic policies and support for Operation Restore Hope, the military intervention in Somalia, by the metaphor of eating other customers&#x27; food.

At &quot;SNL&quot;, Hartman&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Glue&quot; was coined by Adam Sandler according to Jay Mohr&#x27;s book &quot;Gasping for Airtime&quot;. However, according to &quot;You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman&quot; by Mike Thomas, author and staff writer for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, the nickname was created by &quot;SNL&quot; cast member and Hartman&#x27;s frequent on-screen collaborator Jan Hooks. Hartman was very helpful to other cast members. For example, he aided Hooks in overcoming her stage fright. &quot;SNL&quot; creator Lorne Michaels explained the name: &quot;He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance.&quot; Michaels added that Hartman was &quot;the least appreciated&quot; cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability &quot;to do five or six parts in a show where you&#x27;re playing support or you&#x27;re doing remarkable character work&quot;. Hartman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program for &quot;SNL&quot; in 1989, sharing the award with the show&#x27;s other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.

By 1993, almost every cast member who was there during Hartman&#x27;s first year on &quot;SNL&quot; had left the show, including Jon Lovitz, Jan Hooks and Dana Carvey. Hartman said he felt &quot;like an athlete who&#x27;s watched all his World Series teammates get traded off into other directions ... It was hard to watch them leave because I sort of felt we were all part of the team that saved the show.&quot; This cast turnover contributed to his leaving the show in 1994. Hartman said he thought it was time to leave because the show was &quot;getting less sophisticated&quot; and his style of humor did not fit with the less intellectual comedy of newer cast members like Adam Sandler. Hartman had originally planned to leave the show in 1991, but Michaels persuaded him to stay to raise his profile; his portrayal of Clinton contributed to this goal. Jay Leno offered him the role of his sidekick on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; but Hartman opted to stay on &quot;SNL&quot;. NBC persuaded him to stay on &quot;SNL&quot; by promising him his own comedy–variety show &quot;The Phil Show&quot;. He planned to &quot;reinvent the variety form&quot; with &quot;a hybrid, very fast-paced, high energy [show] with sketches, impersonations, pet acts, and performers showcasing their talents&quot;. Hartman was to be the show&#x27;s executive producer and head writer. Before production began, however, the network decided that variety shows were too unpopular and canceled the series. In a 1996 interview, Hartman noted he was glad, as he &quot;would&#x27;ve been sweatin&#x27; blood each week trying to make it work&quot;. In 1998, he admitted he missed working on &quot;SNL&quot;, but had enjoyed the move from New York City to Southern California.

===&quot;NewsRadio&quot; (1995–1998)===
Hartman became one of the stars of the NBC sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot; in 1995, portraying radio news anchor Bill McNeal. He signed up after being attracted by the show&#x27;s writing and use of an ensemble cast, and joked that he based McNeal on himself with &quot;any ethics and character&quot; removed. Hartman made roughly per episode of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;. Although the show was critically acclaimed, it was never a ratings hit and cancellation was a regular threat. After the completion of the fourth season, Hartman commented, &quot;We seem to have limited appeal. We&#x27;re on the edge here, not sure we&#x27;re going to be picked up or not&quot;, but added he was &quot;99 percent sure&quot; the series would be renewed for a fifth season. Hartman had publicly lambasted NBC&#x27;s decision to repeatedly move &quot;NewsRadio&quot; into different timeslots, but later regretted his comments, saying, &quot;this is a sitcom, for crying out loud, not brain surgery&quot;. He also stated that if the sitcom were cancelled &quot;it just will open up other opportunities for me&quot;. Although the show was renewed for a fifth season, Hartman was killed before production began. Ken Tucker praised Hartman&#x27;s performance as McNeal: &quot;A lesser performer ... would have played him as a variation on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;″s Ted Baxter, because that&#x27;s what Bill was, on paper. But Hartman gave infinite variety to Bill&#x27;s self-centeredness, turning him devious, cowardly, squeamish, and foolishly bold from week to week.&quot; Hartman was posthumously nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1998 for his work on &quot;NewsRadio&quot;. David Hyde Pierce won the award for his performance on &quot;Frasier&quot;.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1991–1998)===
Hartman provided the voices for numerous characters on the Fox animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, appearing in 52 episodes. He made his first appearance in the second season episode &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot;. Although he was originally brought in for a one-time appearance, Hartman enjoyed working on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and the staff wrote additional parts for him. He voiced the recurring characters Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure, as well as several background characters. His favorite part was that of McClure, and he often used this voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;. He remarked, &quot;My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans.&quot; He added &quot;It&#x27;s the one thing that I do in my life that&#x27;s almost an avocation. I do it for the pure love of it.&quot;

Hartman was popular among the staff of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein said they enjoyed his work, and used him as much as possible when working on the show. To give Hartman a larger role, they developed the episode &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;, which focuses on Troy McClure and expands the character&#x27;s backstory. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening said that he &quot;took [Hartman] for granted because he nailed the joke every time&quot;, and that his voice acting could produce &quot;the maximum amount of humor&quot; with any line he was given. Before his death, Hartman had expressed an interest in making a live action film about Troy McClure. Many of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; production staff expressed enthusiasm for the project and offered to help. Hartman said he was &quot;looking forward to [McClure&#x27;s] live-action movie, publicizing his Betty Ford appearances&quot;, and &quot;would love nothing more&quot; than making a film and was prepared to buy the film rights himself in order to make it happen.

===Other work===
Hartman&#x27;s first starring film role came in 1995&#x27;s &quot;Houseguest&quot;, alongside Sinbad. Other films include &quot;Greedy&quot;, &quot;Coneheads&quot;, &quot;Sgt. Bilko&quot;, &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot;, &quot;CB4&quot;, &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;, the English Disney/GKIDS dub of &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, and &quot;Small Soldiers&quot;, the latter of which is his final theatrically released film. At the same time, he preferred working on television. His other television roles include appearances on episodes of &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot;, &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;, &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, and the HBO TV film &quot;The Second Civil War&quot; as the President of the United States. He made a considerable amount of money from television advertising, earning $300,000 for a series of four commercials for the soft drink Slice. He also appeared in advertisements for McDonald&#x27;s (as Hugh McAttack) and 1-800-Collect (as Max Jerome).

Hartman wrote a number of screenplays that were never produced. In 1986, he began writing a screenplay for a film titled &quot;Mr. Fix-It&quot;, and completed the final draft in 1991. Robert Zemeckis was signed to produce the film, with Gil Bettman hired to direct. Hartman called it &quot;a sort of a merger of horror and comedy, like &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and &quot;Throw Momma From the Train&quot;&quot;, adding, &quot;It&#x27;s an American nightmare about a family torn asunder. They live next to a toxic dump site, their water supply is poisoned, the mother and son go insane and try to murder each other, the father&#x27;s face is torn off in a terrible disfiguring accident in the first act. It&#x27;s heavy stuff, but it&#x27;s got a good message and a positive, upbeat ending.&quot; Zemeckis could not secure studio backing, however, and the project collapsed. Another film idea involving Hartman&#x27;s Groundlings character Chick Hazard, Private Eye was also canceled.

==Style==
In contrast to his real-life personality, which was described as &quot;a regular guy and, by all accounts, one of show business&#x27;s most low-key, decent people&quot;, Hartman often played seedy, vain or unpleasant characters as well as comedic villains. He described his standard character repertoire as the &quot;jerky guy&quot; and &quot;the weasel parade&quot;, citing Lionel Hutz, Bill McNeal, Troy McClure, and Ted Maltin from &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; as examples. Hartman enjoyed playing such roles because he &quot;just want[ed] to be funny, and villains tend to be funny because their foibles are all there to see&quot;.

He often played supporting roles, rather than the lead part. He said: &quot;[T]hroughout my career, I&#x27;ve never been a huge star, but I&#x27;ve made steady progress and that&#x27;s the way I like it&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s fun coming in as the second or third lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren&#x27;t to blame.&quot; Hartman was considered a &quot;utility player&quot; on &quot;SNL&quot; with a &quot;kind of Everyman quality&quot; which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on &quot;SNL&quot;: &quot;Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been.&quot; He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: &quot;Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian.&quot; Film critic Pauline Kael declared that &quot;Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; are two of the best comic actors I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

Writer and acting coach Paul Ryan noted Hartman&#x27;s work ethic with his impressions. He assembled a collection of video footage of the figure he was preparing to impersonate and watched this continually until he &quot;completely embodied the person&quot;. Ryan concluded that &quot;what made [Hartman&#x27;s impressions] so funny and spot on was Phil&#x27;s ability to add that perfect touch that only comes from trial and error and practicing in front of audiences and fellow actors.&quot; Hartman described this process as &quot;technical&quot;. Journalist Lyle V. Harris said Hartman showed a &quot;rare talent for morphing into... anybody he wanted to be&quot;.

Ken Tucker summarized Hartman&#x27;s comedic style: &quot;He could momentarily fool audiences into thinking he was the straight man, but then he&#x27;d cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until you started laughing.&quot; Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: &quot;He&#x27;s been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, then the same sort of thing in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. I tried to imitate it. I couldn&#x27;t. I wasn&#x27;t good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hartman married Gretchen Lewis in 1970 and they divorced in September 1972. He married real estate agent Lisa Strain in 1982, and their marriage lasted three years. Strain told &quot;People&quot; magazine that Hartman was reclusive off screen and &quot;would disappear emotionally ... he&#x27;d be in his own world. That passivity made you crazy.&quot; In 1987, Hartman married former model and aspiring actress Brynn Omdahl (born Vicki Jo Omdahl, April 11, 1958 – May 28, 1998), having met her on a blind date the previous year. They had two children, Sean and Birgen Hartman. The marriage had difficulties; she was reportedly intimidated by his success and was frustrated that she could not find any on her own, although neither party wanted a divorce. She was reported to have been jealous and often verbally or physically abusive, even sending a letter to his ex-wife, threatening to &quot;rip [Strain&#x27;s] eyes out&quot; if she spoke to him again. Hartman considered retiring to save the marriage.

Hartman tried to get Brynn acting roles, but she became progressively reliant on alcohol and narcotics, entering rehab several times. On multiple occasions, he removed their children from the household to stay with friends or family because of her drug- and alcohol-fueled outbursts. Because of his close friendship with &quot;SNL&quot; associate Jan Hooks, Brynn &quot;joked&quot; on occasion Hooks and Hartman were married &quot;on some other level&quot;. Brynn had written threatening letters addressed to Hooks, warning her to not get close to her husband, but they appeared to have never even been sent, being discovered in her belongings following her death.

Stephen Root, Hartman&#x27;s &quot;NewsRadio&quot; co-star, said few people knew &quot;the real Phil Hartman&quot;, as he was &quot;one of those people who never seemed to come out of character&quot;, but he nevertheless gave the impression of a family man who cared deeply for his children. Hartman befriended Joe Rogan during his time on &quot;NewsRadio&quot; and confided his marital problems to him. Rogan said that he encouraged Hartman to divorce Brynn five times, but &quot;[Hartman] loved his kids and didn&#x27;t want to leave&quot;.

Hartman stated in 1997 that, though a non-practicing Catholic, he displayed a sense of religiousness. In his spare time, he enjoyed driving, flying, sailing, marksmanship, and playing the guitar.

==Murder==
On May 27, 1998, Hartman&#x27;s wife, Brynn, visited the Italian restaurant Buca di Beppo in Encino, California, with producer and writer Christine Zander, who said she was &quot;in a good frame of mind&quot;; they had drinks. After returning home, Brynn had a &quot;heated&quot; argument with Hartman, after which he went to bed. She entered his bedroom some time before PDT on May 28, 1998, and, as he slept, she fatally shot him once between the eyes, once in the throat and once in the upper chest with a .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson Model 15 revolver. Hartman was 49 years old. Brynn was taking Zoloft, had been drinking alcohol, and had recently used cocaine.

Brynn then drove to the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing but he did not believe her. They drove back to the house in separate cars and she called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman&#x27;s body, Douglas called 9-1-1 at Police arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans&#x27; two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom. Shortly afterward, she shot and killed herself with a .38-caliber Charter Arms Undercover revolver.

The police stated Hartman&#x27;s death was caused by &quot;domestic discord&quot; between the couple. A neighbor of the Hartmans told a CNN reporter that the couple had marital problems. Yet actor Steve Guttenberg said they had been &quot;a very happy couple and they always had the appearance of being well-balanced&quot;.

Brynn&#x27;s brother, Gregory Omdahl, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 1999 against both Pfizer, the manufacturer of Zoloft, and his sister’s psychiatrist, Arthur Sorosky, who had provided samples of the antidepressant to Brynn. Pfizer later settled the lawsuit without an admission of any wrongdoing. Hartman&#x27;s friend and former &quot;SNL&quot; colleague Jon Lovitz has accused Hartman&#x27;s &quot;NewsRadio&quot; co-star Andy Dick of reintroducing Brynn to cocaine, causing her to relapse and suffer a nervous breakdown. Dick claimed to have known nothing of her condition. Lovitz later said he no longer blamed Dick for Hartman&#x27;s murder but in 2006, Lovitz claimed Dick had approached him at a restaurant and said, &quot;I put the Phil Hartman hex on you. You&#x27;re the next one to die.&quot; Lovitz then had him ejected from the restaurant. The following year at the Laugh Factory comedy club in Los Angeles, Lovitz and Dick had another argument with Lovitz slamming Dick&#x27;s head into the bar. Dick asserted he was not at fault in relation to Hartman&#x27;s death.

Brynn&#x27;s sister Katharine Omdahl and brother-in-law Mike Wright raised the two Hartman children. Hartman&#x27;s will stipulated each child would inherit money over several years after turning 25. The total value of Hartman&#x27;s estate was estimated at . In accordance with their wishes, both Hartman&#x27;s and Brynn&#x27;s bodies were cremated by Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuary, Glendale, California, and their ashes were scattered over Santa Catalina Island&#x27;s Emerald Bay. A cenotaph with Hartman&#x27;s and Brynn&#x27;s names was installed at a cemetery in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, where Brynn was born.

===Response and legacy===
NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer stated that Hartman &quot;was blessed with a tremendous gift for creating characters who made people laugh. Everyone who had the pleasure of working with Phil knows that he was a man of tremendous warmth, a true professional and a loyal friend.&quot; Guttenberg expressed shock at Hartman&#x27;s death and Steve Martin said he was &quot;a deeply funny and very happy person&quot;. Matt Groening called him &quot;a master&quot; and director Joe Dante said &quot;He was one of those guys who was a dream to work with. I don&#x27;t know anybody who didn&#x27;t like him.&quot; Dan Snierson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; concluded that Hartman was &quot;the last person you&#x27;d expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper&quot; and &quot;a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Hartman the 87th greatest television icon of all time, and &quot;Maxim&quot; named him the top &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performer of all time.

On the day of Hartman&#x27;s death, rehearsals for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and that night&#x27;s performance by The Groundlings were canceled. The season five premiere episode of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, &quot;Bill Moves On&quot; (aired September 23, the day before what would have been his 50th birthday) finds Hartman&#x27;s character, Bill McNeal, has died of a heart attack, while the other characters reminisce about his life. Lovitz joined the show in his place beginning with the next episode. An episode that ended a season of &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, where Hartman played a flamboyant recurring character who ends up kidnapping Harry was scrapped due it being a cliffhanger which would have been resolved in the subsequent season premiere, as well as to show respect for Hartman&#x27;s death. A special episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; commemorating Hartman&#x27;s work on the show aired on June 13, 1998, which ended with one of Hartman&#x27;s performances showing a widow reflecting on her deceased husband played by Hartman. Rather than substituting another voice actor, the writers of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; retired Hartman&#x27;s characters. His final appearance in the tenth season episode &quot;Bart the Mother&quot; is dedicated to him. &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; was dedicated to Hartman, being his final film to be released in movie theatres.

Hartman was preparing to voice Zapp Brannigan, a character written specifically for him on Groening&#x27;s second animated series &quot;Futurama&quot;, at the time of his death. Even though the role was specifically made for him, Hartman still insisted on trying out for the role. About a week before his death, he auditioned for Groening and &quot;Futurama&quot; executive producer David X. Cohen. Groening wrote that Hartman &quot;blew us away with his performances&quot;. After Hartman&#x27;s death, Billy West took over the role. Though Cohen credits West with using his own take on the character, West later said that he purposely tweaked Zapp&#x27;s voice to better match Hartman&#x27;s intended portrayal. Hartman was planning to appear with Lovitz in the indie film &quot;The Day of Swine and Roses,&quot; scheduled to begin production in August 1998.

In 2002, Laugh.com and Hartman&#x27;s brother John published the album &quot;Flat TV&quot;, a selection of comedy sketches recorded by Hartman in the 1970s, which had been kept in storage. John Hartmann commented: &quot;I&#x27;m putting this out there because I&#x27;m dedicating my life to fulfilling his dreams. This [album] is my brother doing what he loved.&quot; &quot;Flat TV&quot; was optioned for an animated adaptation by Michael &quot;Ffish&quot; Hemschoot&#x27;s animation company Worker Studio in 2013. The deal came about after Michael T. Scott, a partner in the company, posted online a handwritten letter he had received from Hartman in 1997, leading to a correspondence between Scott and Paul Hartmann.

A campaign was started on Facebook by Alex Stevens in 2007, and endorsed by Hartman&#x27;s brother Paul, to have Phil inducted to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. Among the campaign&#x27;s numerous publicity events, Ben Miner of the Sirius XM Radio channel Laugh Attack dedicated the month of April 2012 to Hartman. The campaign ended in success and Hartman was inducted on September 22, 2012, to the Walk of Fame, with Paul accepting the award on his late brother&#x27;s behalf. Hartman was also awarded the Cineplex Legends Award. In June 2013, it was announced that Hartman would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which was unveiled on August 26, 2014. Additionally, a special prize at the Canadian Comedy Awards was named for Hartman. Beginning with the 13th Canadian Comedy Awards in 2012, the Phil Hartman Award was awarded to &quot;an individual who helps to better the Canadian comedy community&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Hartman as one of the ten greatest &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast members throughout the show&#x27;s forty-year history, coming in seventh on its list of all 141 members.

<doc id="100843" wikidata="Q2364772" url="?curid=100843" title="Rati">
<text>Rati (, ) is the Hindu goddess of love, carnal desire, lust, passion, and sexual pleasure. Usually described as the daughter of &quot;Prajapati&quot; Daksha, Rati is the female counterpart, the chief consort and the assistant of Kama (Kamadeva), the god of love. A constant companion of Kama, she is often depicted with him in legend and temple sculpture. She also enjoys worship along with Kama.

The Hindu scriptures stress Rati&#x27;s beauty and sensuality. They depict her as a maiden who has the power to enchant the God of Love. When the deity Shiva burns her husband to ashes, it is Rati, whose beseeching or penance, leads to the promise of Kama&#x27;s resurrection. Often, this resurrection occurs when Kama is reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and Rukmini. Rati – under the name of Mayavati – plays a critical role in the upbringing of Pradyumna, who is separated from his parents at birth. She acts as his nanny, as well as his lover, and tells him the way to return to his parents by slaying the demon-king, who is destined to die at his hands. Later, Kama-Pradyumna accepts Rati-Mayavati as his wife.

==Etymology==
The name of the goddess Rati comes from the Sanskrit root &#x27;, meaning &quot;enjoy&quot; or &quot;delight in.&quot; Although the verb root generally refers to any sort of enjoyment, it usually carries connotations of physical and sensual enjoyment. Etymologically, the word &#x27; refers to anything that can be enjoyed; but, it is almost always used to refer to sexual love.

==Legend==

=== Birth and marriage ===

The &quot;Kalika Purana&quot; narrates the following tale about Rati&#x27;s birth. After the creation of the 10 &quot;Prajapatis&quot;, Brahma – the creator-god – creates Kama (Kamadeva), the god of love, from his mind. Kama is ordered to spread love in the world by shooting his flower-arrows. &quot;Prajapati&quot; Daksha is requested to present a wife to Kama. Kama first uses his arrows against Brahma and the &quot;Prajapatis&quot;, who are all incestuously attracted to Brahma&#x27;s daughter Sandhya (&quot;Twilight-dawn/dusk&quot;). The god Shiva, gets enraged by the heinous act of Brahma and shows his condemnation. Embarrassed, Brahma and the &quot;Prajapatis&quot; tremble and perspire. From the sweat of Daksha rises a beautiful woman named Rati, who Daksha presents to Kama as his wife. At the same time, the agitated Brahma curses Kama to be burnt to ashes by Shiva in the future. However, on Kama&#x27;s pleading, Brahma assures him that he would be reborn. The &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; narrates that Sandhya committed suicide, after Brahma lusts for her. The god Vishnu resurrects her and names her Rati, and marries her to Kama. The &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; mentions that after her suicide, Sandhya is reborn from the sweat of Daksha as Rati. In some texts, Shiva is described as the father of Rati.

The &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, an appendix to the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, mentions that Kama and Rati have two children, Harsha (&quot;Joy&quot;) and Yashas (&quot;Grace&quot;). However, the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; mentions that Rati, as &quot;Nandi&quot;, only has one son – Harsha. The epics &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as well as the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, also attest to Rati being the consort of Kama.

=== Rebirth as Mayavati ===

The demon Tarakasura had created havoc in the universe, and only the son of god Shiva could slay him, but Shiva had turned to ascetic ways after the death of his first wife, Sati. Kama was thus instructed by the gods to make Shiva fall in love again. Kama went to Mount Kailash with Rati and Madhu or Vasanta (&quot;Spring&quot;), and shot his love-arrows at Shiva (in another version of the legend, Kama entered Shiva&#x27;s mind) and invoked desire. Wounded by Kama&#x27;s arrows, Shiva becomes attracted to Parvati, the reincarnation of Sati, but agitated, burns Kama by a glance of his third eye.
The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; narrates further that the grief-stricken Rati goes mad by Kama&#x27;s death and in the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; and the &quot;Padma Purana&quot; versions, she smears herself with her husband&#x27;s ashes. Further in &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Rati undergoes severe penance and pleads with Parvati to intercede with Shiva to restore her husband. Parvati reassures her that Kama would be reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna, the avatar of the god Vishnu on earth, and Rati should wait for him in the demon (asura) Sambara&#x27;s house. In other versions of the narrative like the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, the &quot;Padma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, the &quot;Linga Purana&quot; and the &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot;, it is Shiva who blesses Rati with the boon of Kama&#x27;s resurrection. 

In other variants, she curses the gods who sent Kama for this doomed mission and the gods, as a group or Brahma, seeks relief for the grieving Rati from Shiva or the Supreme Goddess, Parvati being one of her many manifestations. In some legends, like the one in the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, the Goddess revives Kama immediately, hearing the pleading of the wailing Rati and the gods. The renowned Sanskrit poet Kalidasa dedicates canto IV discussing the plight of Rati in his &quot;Kumarasambhava&quot;, which focuses on the story of the wedding of Shiva and Parvati and the birth of their son Kartikeya, who kills Tarakasura. Canto IV narrates that Rati witnesses the death of her husband and laments his death, and then tries to immolate herself on a funeral pyre. A heavenly voice stops her on time, stating that after the marriage of Shiva, he will revive her husband.

The &quot;Kedara Khanda&quot; chapter of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; presents a very different version. In this version, after the burning of Kama, Parvati is worried that she could not achieve Shiva in absence of Kama. Parvati is consoled by Rati, who asserts that she will revive Kama and starts severe austerities to achieve her goal. Once, the divine sage Narada asks her &quot;whose she was&quot;. Agitated, Rati insults Narada. The spiteful Narada provokes the demon Sambara to kidnap Rati. Sambara takes her to his house, but is unable to touch her as the goddess decreed that he would be reduced to ashes if he touches her. There, Rati becomes the &quot;kitchen in-charge&quot; and is known as Mayavati (&quot;mistress of illusion – &quot;Maya&quot;&quot;).

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and the &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; continue, that on advice of Shiva, Rati assumes the form of Sambara&#x27;s kitchen-maid Mayavati and awaits her husband&#x27;s arrival in Sambara&#x27;s house. Sambara is foretold that the reborn Kama would be his destroyer. Sambara finds out that Kama was born as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and his chief wife, Rukmini. He steals the child and throws him in the ocean, where the child is swallowed by a fish. This fish is caught by fishermen and sent to Sambara&#x27;s kitchen. When the fish is cut, the child is found by Mayavati, who decides to nurture him. The divine sage Narada reveals to Mayavati that she was Rati and the child was Kama, and that she was to rear him. As the child grew up, the motherly love of Mayavati changes to the passionate love of a wife. The reborn Kama resents her advances, as he considers her his mother. Mayavati tells him the secret of their previous births as narrated by Narada and that he was not her son, but that of Krishna and Rukmini. Mayavati trains Pradyumna in magic and war and advises him to kill Sambara. Pradyumna defeats Sambara and slays him. He returns to Dvaraka, Krishna&#x27;s capital with Mayavati as his wife, where they are welcomed.

The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; and the &quot;Harivamsa&quot; also have a similar account, though the reincarnation of Rati is called Mayadevi and described as Sambara&#x27;s wife, rather than his maid. Both these scriptures safeguard her chastity saying that Rati donned an illusionary form to enchant Sambara. The &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; explicitly states that Rati does not sleep with Sambara, but gave him the illusionary form of Mayavati. Rati-Mayavati takes a critical role in all narratives of this story where she seduces – by her &quot;Maya&quot; – both Sambara and Kama-Pradyumna, her &quot;son&quot; who she convinces to be her lover. All texts at the end stress on her purity, untouched by another man.

The &quot;Harivamsa&quot; describes Aniruddha, the son of Pradyumna, as &quot;the son of Rati&quot;.

==Associations, worship, and iconography ==

The name &quot;Rati&quot; in Sanskrit means &quot;the pleasure of love, sexual passion or union, amorous enjoyment&quot;, all of which Rati personifies. Rati also indicates the female-seed. The word &quot;Rati&quot; also gives rise to other love-related Sanskrit words like &quot;Kama-rati&quot; (&quot;a man stupefied by desire&quot;), &quot;rati-karman&quot; (&quot;sexual intercourse&quot;), &quot;rati-laksha&quot; (&quot;sexual intercourse&quot;), &quot;rati-bhoga&quot; (&quot;sexual enjoyment&quot;), &quot;rati-shakti&quot; (&quot;virile power&quot;), &quot;rati-jna&quot; (&quot;skilled in the art of love&quot;), and &quot;rati-yuddha&quot; (&quot;a sex-battle&quot;). The word &quot;Rati&quot; also appears in title of the Sanskrit erotic work &quot;Rati-Rahasya&quot; (&quot;secrets of Rati&quot;) – which is said to contain the sexual secrets of the goddess – as well as in the Sanskrit names of many sex techniques and positions like &quot;Rati-pasha&quot; (&quot;the noose of Rati&quot;), a sex position in which the woman locks her legs behind her lover&#x27;s back.

Rati stands for sexual pleasure, carnal desire and sexuality. Rati represents only the pleasure aspect of sexual activity and does not relate to child-birth or motherhood. Professor Catherine Benton of the Lake Forest College (Department of Religion) relates her birth from the &quot;desire-ridden&quot; sweat to bodily fluids produced during sexual intercourse, which are considered impure in Hinduism. Her association with Kama – the auspicious god of love – grants her the status of an auspicious goddess. Rati and Kama are often pictured on temple walls as &quot;welcome sculptures&quot;, symbols of good fortune and prosperity. Not only is Rati Kama&#x27;s consort, but she is also his assistant and constant companion, who arouses sexual feelings. Kama is usually depicted with Rati along his side. Rati is also included as a minor character in any drama involving Kama. Rati also enjoys worship with Kama in some festival rites dedicated to him.

The &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; mentions that Kama himself was pierced by his love-arrows when he saw his &quot;auspicious wife&quot;, Rati. Rati, as well as her husband Kama, ride a parrot as their &quot;vahana&quot; (vehicle). Rati is often depicted with a sword.

In Tantra, the Mahavidya goddess Chhinnamasta is depicted severing her own head and standing on the copulating couple of Kama and Rati, with the latter on top, (&quot;viparita-rati&quot; sex position). The woman-on-top position suggests female dominance over male. Chhinnamasta standing on a copulating couple of Kama and Rati is interpreted by some as a symbol of self-control of sexual desire, while others interpret it as the goddess, being an embodiment of sexual energy. Images of Chhinnamasta depicted sitting on Kamadeva-Rati in a non-suppressive fashion are associated with the latter interpretation. The love-deity couple also symbolize maithuna, ritual sexual union.

==Outside Indian subcontinent==
===Indonesia===

In the Indonesian version, Rati (Indonesian: &quot;Kamaratih&quot; ) is the daughter of Bathara Soma, the son of Sanghyang Pancaresi, the descendant of Sanghyang Wening, the younger brother of Sanghyang Wenang. Kamaratih is married to Bathara Kamajaya, the ninth son of Sanghyang Ismaya and Dewi Senggani. He resides in Kahyangan Cakrakembang.

Kamaratih has a very beautiful face, has charm and character, is very loyal, loving, generous, kind, patient, and devoted to her husband. She, together with her husband, Bathara Kamajaya, is a symbol of husband-wife harmony in the universe, because of their harmony and love for one another.

Kamaratih was once assigned by Sanghyang Manikmaya to send Wahyu Hidayat to Dewi Utari, the youngest son of Prabu Matswapati, the king of Wirata and his consort, Dewi Ni Yutisnawati/Setyawati. Wahyu Hidayat was revealed as the pair of Wahyu Cakraningrat who was passed down by Bathara Kamajaya to Raden Abhimanyu/Angkawijaya, son of Arjuna and Dewi Sumbadra.

<text>Ulverston is a market town and civil parish in Westmorland and Furness, Cumbria, England. Historically in Lancashire, it lies a few miles south of the Lake District National Park and just north-west of Morecambe Bay, within the Furness Peninsula. Lancaster is to the east, Barrow-in-Furness to the south-west and Kendal to the north-east. In the 2001 census the parish had a population of 11,524, increasing at the 2011 census to 11,678.

==History==

The name &quot;Ulverston&quot;, first noted as &quot;Ulurestun&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, consists of an Old Norse personal name, &quot;Úlfarr&quot;, or the Old English &quot;Wulfhere&quot;, with the Old English &quot;tūn&quot;, meaning farmstead or village. The personal names &quot;Úlfarr&quot; and &quot;Wulfhere&quot; both imply &quot;wolf warrior&quot; or &quot;wolf army&quot;, which explains the presence of a wolf on the town&#x27;s coat of arms. The loss of the initial W in &quot;Wulfhere&quot; can be linked to Scandinavian influence in the region. Locally, the town has traditionally been known as &quot;Oostan&quot;. Other variants include &quot;Oluestonam&quot; (1127), and &quot;Uluereston&quot; (1189). The name was spelled &quot;Ulverstone&quot; until at least 1888.

The market charter granted in 1280 by Edward I was for a market on Thursdays. The town retains its market-town appearance; market days are now Thursdays and Saturdays. The charter also allowed public houses to open from 10:30 am to 11:00 pm, regardless of other statute on the books. The present Saturday market includes in the summer craft stalls, charity stalls and locally produced ware on &quot;Made in Cumbria&quot; stalls.

The parish church is a listed building and was founded in the 12th century.
Historically, the parish included chapelries and townships that later became separate civil parishes: Blawith, Church Coniston, Egton with Newland, Lowick, Mansriggs, Osmotherley, Subberthwaite and Torver. From 1894 to 1974 the town served as an urban district in the administrative county of Lancashire. Under the Local Government Act 1972 it became a successor parish in the Cumbria district of South Lakeland.

Town Bank Grammar School was founded in 1658 from a benefaction by Thomas Fell. The Victoria Road drill hall opened in 1873.

The High Carley Hospital and Ulverston Joint Hospital Board built an infectious disease hospital at High Carley, Pennington, in 1884. It was initially a fever hospital for paupers. In 1916 a second hospital, run by Lancashire County Council, was built to treat tubercular patients. From 1949 a children&#x27;s annexe was built. In the 1950s, as the number of tubercular patients decreased, the hospital was run as an acute hospital. In 1984, after the building of the new Furness General Hospital, High Carley was closed.

In 2009, the comedian Ken Dodd unveiled a statue of Laurel and Hardy (by Graham Ibbeson) outside Coronation Hall in the town centre.

<text>Harry Seidler (25 June 19239 March 2006) was an Austrian-born Australian architect who is considered to be one of the leading exponents of Modernism&#x27;s methodology in Australia and the first architect to fully express the principles of the Bauhaus in Australia.

Seidler designed about 119 buildings (96 of which were in his home state of New South Wales) but some have since been demolished or altered in a non-Seidler manner, and he received much recognition for his contribution to the architecture of Australia. Seidler consistently won architectural awards every decade throughout his Australian career of almost 58 years across the varied categories – his residential work from 1950, his commercial work from 1964, and his public commissions from the 1970s. He was a controversial figure throughout his long career as he regularly publicly criticised planning authorities and the planning system in Sydney.

==Early life==
Seidler was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish clothing manufacturer. While a teenager he fled to England soon after Nazi Germany occupied Austria in 1938.

==Education==

In England, he studied building and construction at Cambridgeshire Technical School. Even though he was categorised by British wartime tribunal as a &quot;Category C – no risk&quot; refugee fleeing the Nazis, because he was born in Austria, on 12 May 1940, he was interned by the British authorities as an enemy alien, where he was in internment camps first at Huyton near Liverpool, then on the Isle of Man before being shipped to Quebec, Canada and continued to be interned until October 1941, when he was released on probational release from internment to study architecture at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, where he graduated with first class honours in 1944.

After working briefly for an architectural firm in Toronto, Seidler (at the age of 21) became a registered architect in Ontario, in February 1945. 

Although he was ten years old when the Bauhaus was closed, Seidler&#x27;s analysts invariably associate him with the Bauhaus because he later studied under emigrant Bauhaus teachers in the USA. He attended Harvard Graduate School of Design under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer on a scholarship in 1945/46, and during the university winter (Christmas) inter-semester approximate four weeks break Seidler worked with Alvar Aalto in Boston drawing up plans for the Baker dormitory at MIT. He then studied visual aesthetics at Black Mountain College under the painter Josef Albers in mid 1946 for the US summer.

==Early career outside Australia==
Seidler then worked as the first ever assistant to Marcel Breuer in New York from late 1946 until March 1948. For almost 2 months from shortly after 20 April to early June 1948, Seidler also worked in Rio de Janeiro with the architect Oscar Niemeyer.

==Life in Australia==
Seidler&#x27;s parents migrated to Sydney in 1946, and (while he was working for Breuer in New York) in late 1947 or early 1948, his mother wrote to him to commission him to come to Sydney to design their home. Seidler arrived in Sydney on (likely) 20 June 1948 (which was a few days before his 25th birthday), with no intention to remain in Australia, but to stay only until the house was finished. The house became known as the Rose Seidler House (1948–1950), in Wahroonga, in remote bushland of a suburb on Sydney&#x27;s Upper North Shore. This project was the first completely modern domestic residence to fully express the philosophy and visual language of the Bauhaus in Australia and won the Sulman Award of 1951. From the huge publicity of this house, others approached Seidler to design their homes. With so many clients and his enjoyment of the Sydney climate and harbour views, Seidler decided to stay in Australia. The Rose Seidler House became a house-museum in 1991.

In 1952, Seidler successfully appealed against Ku-ring-gai council&#x27;s refusal to approve his design of a &#x27;glass house&#x27; at Roseville.

In the 1960s Seidler again broke new ground with his design for the Australia Square project (first designs 1961, plaza building 1962–64, tower 1964–67). At the time, the Australia Square tower was the world&#x27;s tallest light weight concrete building. The design introduced the concept of a large public open plaza and prominent artworks to office towers in Australia.

In 1966, he helped lead the protests to try to keep Jørn Utzon as the principal architect of the Sydney Opera House.

He was a founding member of the Australian Architecture Association. In 1984 he became the first Australian to be elected a member of the Académie d&#x27;architecture, Paris and in 1987 was made a Companion of the Order of Australia, an honour which he accepted in his trademark suit and bowtie. Over the years Mr Seidler was also awarded five Sulman Medals by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, as well as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1976, and the Royal Gold Medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1996.

== Personal life ==

Harry Seidler became a Canadian citizen when he was studying in the USA in late 1945. He travelled to Australia in 1948 on his Canadian passport (which he collected in mid-1946). By 1958, he had lived in Australia for ten years, and then sought to renew his Canadian passport but was unable to do so because he had been a naturalised Canadian who had not lived in Canada for more than three years). He became an Australian citizen in late 1958 so he would have a passport to travel for work and his honeymoon. Harry Seidler married Penelope Evatt, daughter of Clive Evatt on 15 December 1958; they had two children.

Seidler enjoyed photographing architecture around the world and some of these are documented in his photography book &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;. He also enjoyed skiing.

Penelope Seidler, herself an architect, gained her Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Sydney and joined Seidler and Associates in 1964 as architect and financial manager. She co-designed the Harry &amp; Penelope Seidler House in Killara (suburb of Sydney) which won the NSW Wilkinson award of 1967.

On 24 April 2005, Seidler suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered, and died from septicaemia in Sydney on 9 March 2006 at age 82.

==Modernism and principles of design==
Seidler said the term &quot;International Style&quot; was a misnomer and so he objected to the term being used to describe modern architecture or his own architectural designs – as both changed over time as social use and building technology developed. Seidler insisted that Modernism was not a style but was in constant flux. Seidler would explain that Le Corbusier&#x27;s 1920s modern architecture had columns placed 6 metres apart, whereas by mid-1980s pre-stressed concrete technology allowed 34 metre column-free space, resulting in different visual expression and openness in architecture.

Seidler&#x27;s work shows a mix of influences from four great modern masters under whom he studied or worked with: Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, (artist) Josef Albers and Oscar Niemeyer. Seidler maintained relationships with his four mentors even after he came to Australia. Seidler was instrumental in having Walter Gropius address the RAIA Convention in Sydney in 1954. Seidler collaborated with Marcel Breuer for the Australian Embassy in Paris (as Breuer had a Paris office) and Seidler was Breuer&#x27;s project architect for the Torin Factory in Penrith NSW in the 1970s. Seidler commissioned Josef Albers artworks for MLC Centre in the mid-1970s. Seidler also maintained a close friendship with Oscar Niemeyer through letters and visits to Rio de Janeiro.

Gropius&#x27; teachings had a big influence on Seidler. Gropius taught that Modernism was not a style but a methodology of approach which will vary according to different regions and climates. Seidler too insisted that Modernism was not a style &quot;&quot;You know there&#x27;s a great misconception about that modernism is a style. It isn&#x27;t. It is a methodology of approach, that is in constant flux, constant change.&quot; Seidler&#x27;s designs upheld a Modernist design methodology, which he considered to be an amalgam of three elements: social use, efficient building construction methods and visual aesthetics. As these three elements were in constantly changing, Seidler always insisted that he had no fixed &#x27;style&#x27;, and so as building technology and social use changed, the visual expression of his designs constantly evolved throughout his 57 years of designing in Australia.

The form of Seidler&#x27;s work changed as building technology changed: from his timber houses in the 1950s (many of which echoed Breuer&#x27;s bi-nuclear house form), to reinforced concrete houses and buildings in the 1960–1980s, and the development of curves (in plan shapes) with advances in concrete technology in the 1980s and later, as well as developments in steel technology that allowed for curved roofs in the 1990s onwards (e.g. Berman House). Seidler is on record (in 1980) as stating that Oscar Niemeyer&#x27;s interior of the Boavista Bank in Rio of 1946 (which Seidler would have seen in 1948) with its interacting curves must have influenced Seidler&#x27;s use of interacting curves in exterior playground and retainer walls from the mid 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Upon celebrating 50 years of architectural practice in Australia, Seidler noted that developments in building technology allowed for more richness of form in his then soon-to-be completed Horizon apartment tower: &quot;I could not have built Horizon twenty years ago...in earlier building technology (the way one could) span distances, it was very limited. (But Horizon) is made (possible) by devices such as pre-stressed concrete which is ...economic and quick. And that also gives you greater freedom of the shapes that you can use. Nowadays we can span huge distances and to do so (by) not just putting steel mesh or something into the concrete but to put steel, high tensile steel wire into it and pull it tight and that makes it easy to span distances and give this kind of change of shape of a building which would have been very difficult to achieve any other way.&quot;

While some commentators label Seidler&#x27;s use of (unpainted) off-form concrete in the 1960s and 1970s as &quot;brutalist&quot; (from the French &#x27;beton brut&#x27;), Seidler disowned the term as he was critical of British Brutalists as &quot;pathetic imitations of Le Corbusier. The heavy monolithic structures of the &#x27;brutalists&#x27;, were the opposite of Seidler&#x27;s visual aesthetic of transparency and lightness and being able to look through the architecture through the voids through the various architectural spaces.

In the 1960s and 70s Seidler worked with the Italian structural engineer Pier Luigi Nervi for the design of the Australia Square and MLC Centre office towers, in Sydney, the Edmund Barton Building (formerly called Trade Group Offices) in Canberra, and the Australian Embassy in Paris in the 1970s. the same Nervi- designed T beams were used by Seidler in his own Seidler Office building in Milsons Point (Sydney) completed in 1973. Seidler later worked with Nervi&#x27;s successor Mario Desideri for the Riverside Centre in Brisbane.

Seidler learnt from Gropius (as one of the 3 required elements of good architecture) to devise efficient &quot;systems&quot; for constructing buildings – other than for individual houses, this involved &quot;making things easy to build in accordance with a system that allows repetition of identical elements&quot;. This is why Kenneth Frampton labelled Seidler&#x27;s non-house designs &quot;isostatic architecture&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s, Seidler used the geometry of the quadrant which connects the straight line to the curve and allowed for structural beams of the same size spanning across the radius of the quadrant. This is seen in Seidler&#x27;s design for the Australian Embassy in Paris and Karralyka (previously called Ringwood Cultural) Centre.

Seidler saw parallels of good modern architecture with the underlying structural geometry of baroque architecture, especially the designs of Italian architect Francesco Borromini (which was illustrated in the book &quot;Space, Time &amp; Architecture&quot; by Sigfried Gidieon which Seidler read as an architecture student). Seidler&#x27;s designs from 1969 onwards often displayed opposing negative and positive quarter-circle curves (e.g. retaining garden walls of Pettit &amp; Sevitt exhibition house, Westleigh, 1969, and Condominium Apartments, Acapulco 1969–70). From the 1980s, Seidler often incorporated plans with flamboyant curves (e.g. Hannes House, Hong Kong Club) and some commentators have labelled this as the start of Seidler&#x27;s &quot;baroque&quot; period.
Seidler&#x27;s visual approach to two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial arrangement was consistent throughout his whole career and reflected what Seidler learnt from his visual aesthetics teacher Josef Albers. Seidler stated he learnt more about design from Albers than he did at any architecture school. Albers stated that designs which visually had a high centre of gravity were more dynamic than solid earth bound designs – which is why Seidler used (for non-tower designs) &quot;cantilevered slabs hovering in mid-air which seem to &#x27;negate&#x27; the fact that mass is something solid and heavy&quot;. Seidler would claim &quot;aesthetically we want dematerialisation&quot;. Seidler, following Albers, also shunned traditional symmetry or grid-like modern designs as static (and thus dull), instead Seidler &quot;offset&quot; opposing elements to create &quot;scintillation&quot; and &quot;visual tension&quot; to be more visually dynamic and thus interesting to the eye. which is seen in the window pattern of Seidler&#x27;s Blues Point Tower (1958–62) and three-dimensionally in the syncopated balcony arrangement of this Horizon Tower (1995–98).

Seidler articulated the visual-spatial design principle of modern architecture being &quot;dissolution of conventional solidity&quot; and inter-connecting spatial vistas. Seidler said the visual essence of modern architecture was &quot;not the ponderous solidity of traditional architecture where everything was built to four walls around a room and spaces that were finite. But rather our eyes seek transparency, lightness... being able to look through things&quot;. He said of his first work, the Rose Seidler House. &quot;This house explodes the surfaces that enclose a normal house or space, and turns it into a continuum of free standing planes, through which the eye can never see an end, you are always intrigued what&#x27;s beyond, you can always see something floating into the distance, there is never an obstruction to your vision, it is a continuum (of space), that I believe 20th century man&#x27;s eye and senses responds positively to that, we crave this&quot;. Again referring to Rose Seidler House plan, &quot;(there are) planes of interacting solid walls and glass walls – solids and voids follow each other around, generating flows of space between them&quot;. Seidler also explains same principle for three-dimensional spatial arrangement as highly influenced by Theo van Doesburg&#x27;s painting &quot;Space-time construction #3&quot; (1923) in which there is an interpenetration of space and spatial flow between hovering planes which creates &quot;an openness which is so much more subtle than it is when it&#x27;s totally open and which is so often done&quot; &quot;Architecture in recent times has been immensely concerned about this idiom of the exploitation of the interior space which involves this simultaneous viewing of things, the channeling of vistas between its elements. ... As Le Corbusier has said, &#x27;Instead of the eye and the mind being abruptly halted by edges and containing surfaces, as had been the case in the past, they are now laid continuously on an exploration, never quite comprehending the mystery of layered and veiled space&#x27;.&quot; Seidler says of the design for his Gissing House: &quot;in three dimensions, the fact that the eye is always tempted to look beyond and never quite experiencing it all. There is a temptation with the seeing of things that are not entirely apparent, the tantalising sense of the beyond which you in fact are denied and which entices a person to move through and try and explore an interior.&quot;

In 1991, Seidler acknowledged that his first house (Rose Seidler House) which was built of timber, despite the north facing sunshades &quot;is generally too vulnerable to temperature changes...I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate the intensity of the Australian sun&quot;. Thus, later in his career, he sought to use more thermally stable materials like reinforced concrete and to respond to the Australian climate by the extensive use of sunshades and flamboyantly-shaped rain protecting canopies on his skyscrapers, (such as Grosvenor Place, Riverside Centre, and QV1), large covered balconies in his houses, as well as shaping his designs to maximize views and enjoyment of the outdoors from inside.

==Collaboration with visual artists==
Seidler was a frequent and enthusiastic collaborator with visual artists in the creation of his buildings. While his artist collaborators include famous or notable figures such as Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Lin Utzon, Norman Carlberg, Charles O. Perry (the last two were fellow but later student of Josef Albers), Helen Frankenthaler, Sol LeWitt and many others, by far the most important of the collaborators was his mentor Albers. Seidler included works by Albers – perhaps the single person most influential on his design philosophy – in a number of projects (notably the MLC Centre with &#x27;Homage to the Square&#x27; (later repurchased by the Albers Foundation, and Albers&#x27; last commissioned-design &#x27;Wrestling&#x27; on the eastern side of MLC Plaza). Seidler also arranged in 1966 for the Australia Square tower ground lobby to display tapestries by Le Corbusier and Victor Vasarely – these were replaced in late 2003 by the Sol LeWitt mural. Seidler also selected and paid for Australian artworks to be shipped in 1977 to be ready to be displayed for the opening of the Australian Embassy in Paris in early 1978. As Paul Bartizan indicates in his obituary tribute to Seidler, these works of art were not mere &#x27;plop art&#x27;; they were really planned to be integrated with and complementary to the buildings into which they were placed: &quot;In many of his projects, Seidler worked with artists whose works became an intrinsic component of his designs.&quot;

<doc id="100851" wikidata="Q362098" url="?curid=100851" title="Historical cost">
<text>The historical cost of an asset at the time it is acquired or created is the value of the costs incurred in acquiring or creating the asset, comprising the consideration paid to acquire or create the asset plus transaction costs. Historical cost accounting involves reporting assets and liabilities at their historical costs, which are not updated for changes in the items&#x27; values. Consequently, the amounts reported for these balance sheet items often differ from their current economic or market values.

While use of historical cost measurement is criticised for its lack of timely reporting of value changes, it remains in use in most accounting systems during periods of low and high inflation and deflation. During hyperinflation, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of the monthly CPI as set out in IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies. Various adjustments to historical cost are used, many of which require the use of management judgment and may be difficult to verify. The trend in most accounting standards is towards more timely reflection of the fair or market value of some assets and liabilities, although the historical cost principle remains in use. Many accounting standards require disclosure of current values for certain assets and liabilities in the footnotes to the financial statements instead of reporting them on the balance sheet.

For some types of assets with readily available market values, standards require that the carrying value of an asset (or liability) be updated to the market price or some other estimate of value that approximates current value (fair value, also fair market value). Accounting standards vary as to how the resultant change in value of an asset or liability is recorded; it may be included in income or as a direct change to shareholders&#x27; equity.

The capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power model is an International Accounting Standards Board approved alternative basic accounting model to the traditional historical cost accounting model.

==Historical cost basis (original cost)==
Under the historical cost basis of accounting, assets and liabilities are recorded at their values when first acquired. They are not then generally restated for changes in values.

Costs recorded in the Income Statement are based on the historical cost of items sold or used, rather than their replacement costs.

For example,
* a company acquires an asset in year 1 for $100
* the asset is still held at the end of year 1, when its market value is $120
* the company sells the asset in year 2 for $115

At the end year 1 the asset is recorded in the balance sheet at cost of $100. No account is taken of the increase in value from $100 to $120 in year 1.
In year 2 the company records a sale of $115. The cost of sales is $100, being the historical cost of the asset. This gives rise to a gain of $15 which is wholly recognized in year 2.

==Measurement under the historical cost basis==

===Inventory===
It is standard under the historical cost basis to report the cost of inventory (stock) at the lower of cost and net realisable value. As a result:-
* A decrease in the realisable value of inventory to an amount below its historical cost is recognised immediately
* An increase in the realisable value of inventory is not recognised until the inventory is sold.

===Property, plant and equipment===
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at its historical cost. Cost includes:-
* Purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;
* Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating. These can include site preparation, delivery and handling costs, installation, assembly, testing, professional fees and the costs of employees directly involved in these activities.
In IFRS, cost also includes the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring it. Cost may include the cost of borrowing to finance construction if this policy is consistently adopted.
The historical cost is then depreciated: it is systematically reduced to the recoverable amount, over the estimated useful life of the asset, to reflect the asset&#x27;s usage. The depreciation (reduction of historical cost) is charged to expense. In most cases the &quot;straight line&quot; depreciation method is used, resulting in the same depreciation charge each year until it is expected to be sold or no further economic benefits obtained from it. Other patterns of depreciation are used if assets are used proportionately more in some periods than others.

===Financial instruments===
Certain financial items may be recorded at historical cost which is the basic method of financial accounting. Any initial issue premium or discount is amortized to interest over time, and the resulting value is often described as amortized cost.

==Exceptions to the historical cost basis of accounting==

===Revaluation of property, plant and equipment===
Under IFRS it is acceptable, but not required, to re-measure the values of property, plant and equipment at their fair (current) values. &#x27;Fair value&#x27; is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm&#x27;s length transaction. Such a policy must be applied to all assets of a particular class. It would therefore be acceptable for an entity to revalue freehold properties every three years. The revaluations must be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying value does not differ materially from market value in subsequent years. A surplus on revaluation would be recorded as a reserve movement, not as income.

===Derivative financial instruments===
Under IFRS and US GAAP derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value, with value changes recorded in the income statement.

===Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies===
IFRS requires IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies which prescribes capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in currencies deemed to be hyperinflationary. The characteristics of a hyperinflation include the population keeping its wealth in non-monetary assets or relatively stable foreign currencies, prices quoted in foreign currencies or widespread indexation of prices. This might arise if cumulative inflation reaches or exceeds 100% over three years.
An entity operating in a hyperinflationary economy:-
* Records a gain or loss on its &#x27;net monetary position&#x27; in its income statement.
* Records non-monetary items (for example, property, plant &amp; equipment) in the balance sheet by applying indexation to their historical cost.

===Management accounting techniques===
In management accounting there are a number of techniques used as alternatives to historical cost accounting, including:-
* measuring profit on sale of inventory by reference to its replacement cost. If inventory with a historical cost of $100 is sold for $115 when it costs $110 to replace it, the profit recorded would be $5 only based on replacement cost, not $15;
* charging economic rent for assets, particularly property. If a business uses a 20-year-old property which it owns, depreciation on a historical cost basis might be insignificant. However, the management accounts could show a notional rent payable, being perhaps opportunity cost - the amount the business could receive if it let the property to a third party.

==IASB approved alternative to historical cost accounting==

The IASB&#x27;s Framework introduced Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power as an alternative to Historical Cost Accounting in 1989 in Par. 104 (a) where it states that financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units - the traditional HCA model - or in units of constant purchasing power at all levels of inflation and deflation: the CMUCPP model.

The specific choice of measuring financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power (the CMUCPP model) at all levels of inflation and deflation as contained in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, was approved by the International Accounting Standards Board&#x27;s predecessor body, the International Accounting Standards Committee Board, in April 1989 for publication in July 1989 and adopted by the IASB in April 2001.

&quot;In the absence of a Standard or an Interpretation that specifically applies to a transaction, management must use its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is relevant and reliable. In making that judgement, IAS 8.11 requires management to consider the definitions, recognition criteria, and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income, and expenses in the Framework. This elevation of the importance of the Framework was added in the 2003 revisions to IAS 8.&quot;
IAS8, 11: &quot;In making the judgement, management shall refer to, and consider the applicability of, the following sources in descending order:
(a) the requirements and guidance in Standards and Interpretations dealing with similar and related issues; and
(b) the definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the Framework.&quot;

There is no applicable International Financial Reporting Standard or Interpretation regarding the valuation of constant real value non-monetary items, e.g. issued share capital, retained earnings, capital reserves, all other items in Shareholders Equity, trade debtors, trade creditors, deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes payable and receivable, all other non-monetary receivables and payables, Profit and Loss account items such as salaries, wages, rents, etc. The Framework is thus applicable.

The CMUCPP model is chosen by hardly any accountant in non-hyperinflationary economies even though it would automatically maintain the real value of constant real value non-monetary items, e.g. issued share capital, retained income, other shareholder equity items, trade debtors, trade creditors, etc., constant for an unlimited period of time in all entities that at least in real value at all levels of inflation and deflation - all else being equal. This is because the CMUCPP model is generally viewed by accountants as a 1970s failed inflation accounting model that requires all non-monetary items - variable real value non-monetary items and constant real value non-monetary items - to be inflation-adjusted by means of the Consumer Price Index.

The IASB did not approve CMUCPP in 1989 as an inflation accounting model. CMUCPP by measuring financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power incorporates an alternative capital concept, financial capital maintenance concept and profit determination concept to the Historical Cost capital concept, financial capital maintenance concept and profit determination concept. CMUCPP requires all constant real value non-monetary items, e.g. issued share capital, retained income, all other items in Shareholders Equity, trade debtors, trade creditors, deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes payable and receivable, all items in the profit and loss account, etc. to be valued in units of constant purchasing power on a daily basis. Variable real value non-monetary items, e.g. property, plant, equipment, listed and unlisted shares, inventory, etc. are valued in terms of IFRS and updated daily.

The IASB requires entities to implement IAS 29 which is a Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power model during hyperinflation.

==Advantages and disadvantages of historical cost accounting==
Advantages
* Historical cost accounts are straightforward to produce
* Historical cost accounts do not record gains until they are realized
* Historical cost accounts are still used in most accounting systems

Disadvantages
* Historical cost accounts give no indication of current values of the assets of a business
* Historical cost accounts do not record the opportunity costs of the use of older assets, particularly property which may be recorded at a value based on costs incurred many years ago
* Historical cost accounts do not report/account the loss of real value of nominal monetary items as a result of inflation or the gain in real value in nominal monetary items during deflation.

<text>Robert Brackett Elliott (March 26, 1923 – February 2, 2016) was an American comedian and actor, one-half of the comedy duo of Bob and Ray. He was the father of comedian/actor Chris Elliott and grandfather of actresses and comedians Abby Elliott and Bridey Elliott. He is most remembered for the character of radio reporter Wally Ballou.

==Life and career==
Elliott was born in Winchester, Massachusetts, the son of Gail Marguarite (née Brackett), a needleworker, and Fred Russell Elliott, who worked in insurance. Bob Elliott served in the U.S. Army in Northern Europe during World War II. On radio, he appeared in programs with his long-time partner Ray Goulding. These were in different series and time slots over decades, beginning in the late 1940s at Boston&#x27;s WHDH radio on the show &quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot;.

 On television, Elliott and Goulding hosted &quot;Bob and Ray&quot; from 1951 to 1953. He appeared on a number of other television programs, including &quot;Happy Days&quot;; &quot;Newhart&quot;; and &quot;Bob &amp; Ray, Jane, Laraine &amp; Gilda&quot; in 1979 (with Goulding, Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman and Gilda Radner); &quot;The David Steinberg Show&quot;; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 1982, Elliott was in &quot;Author! Author!&quot; as Patrick Dicker. He would star in made-for-TV-Movie&#x27;s such as &quot;Between Time and Timbuktu&quot; and &quot;FDR: A One Man Show&quot;. Elliott also made television commercials, and co-wrote some humor articles with Ray Goulding for &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; in the 1950s.

In 1970, the duo debuted in &quot;The Two and Only&quot; on Broadway. Bob and Goulding worked together up until Goulding&#x27;s death in 1990.

==Solo works==
In 1990, Elliott portrayed a bank guard in &quot;Quick Change&quot;. In 1990, he portrayed &quot;Fred Peterson&quot; in the television series &quot;Get a Life&quot;, which starred Chris as his son. Four years later, the elder Elliott appeared in the Tim Burton production &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;, playing Chris&#x27;s father again. In 2004, he appeared in a skit on the Air America radio program &quot;The O&#x27;Franken Factor&quot;. Elliott appeared on radio with Garrison Keillor in &quot;The American Radio Company of the Air&quot;.

==Personal life==
Elliott married Jane Underwood in 1943. They divorced in 1953, having no children. &quot;Bob and Ray&quot; writer Raymond Knight died in 1953. In 1954, Elliott married Knight&#x27;s widow, Lee (née Peppers). They were married for 58 years until her death in 2012. They had two sons, Chris Elliott and Bob Elliott Jr., and one daughter, Amy Andersen. They adopted Lee and Ray Knight&#x27;s two children, Colony Elliott Santangelo and Shannon Elliott. They had 11 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. 

In 1989, Elliott co-authored son Chris&#x27;s mock autobiography, &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Boy: A Son&#x27;s Shocking Account of Life with a Famous Father&quot;.

===Death===
Elliott died in Cundy&#x27;s Harbor, Maine on February 2, 2016, from throat cancer at the age of 92.

<text>Calvert Grant DeForest (July 23, 1921 – March 19, 2007), also known by his character name Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman, was an American actor and comedian, best known for his appearances on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. 

==Biography==

===Early life===
DeForest grew up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He was born to Calvert Martin DeForest, M.D., a physician who died in 1930 at the age of 49, and Mabelle (Taylor) DeForest. He claimed that his father was related to radio pioneer Lee de Forest.

DeForest attended Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn, New York. He was employed for many years as a file clerk at the pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis, which was later acquired by Pfizer. He had aspirations of acting but was discouraged by his mother, who was briefly an actress herself. After her death in 1969, DeForest did part-time backstage work, which eventually led to acting work, and is credited with appearing in five films from 1972 to 1982. He worked part-time as a receptionist at a drug rehabilitation center until February 1984, when his supervisor learned of his employment with NBC and his resulting ineligibility for the position (as it was part of a program designed for those who made under $6,000 a year) and asked him to resign.

===Work with David Letterman===

In early 1982, DeForest was hired to appear on the new NBC program &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. His late-blossoming television career began with a New York University student film project called &quot;King of the Zs&quot;, by future Letterman writers Stephen Winer and Karl Tiedemann, who brought him along when they joined the &quot;Late Night&quot; writing staff. The Associated Press noted: &quot;DeForest&#x27;s gnomish face was the first to greet viewers when Letterman&#x27;s NBC show debuted on February 1, 1982, offering a parody of the prologue to the Boris Karloff film &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. &#x27;It was the greatest thing that had happened in my life,&#x27; he once said of his first Letterman appearance.&quot;

On &quot;Late Night&quot;, DeForest played the role of Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman. &quot;Late Night&quot; talent coordinator Sandra Furton described him as a &quot;mascot&quot;, but Melman had no real fixed or defined role on the show. He was simply an older, short, portly man with thick black-framed glasses who was seen relatively frequently, especially in the early years. In the first few years of the show, the Melman character was somewhat of an entrepreneur, appearing in ads for &quot;Melman Bus Lines&quot; as well as for &quot;Mr. Larry&#x27;s Toast On A Stick&quot; (&quot;Bread&#x27;s answer to the Popsicle!&quot;). He was also ostensibly the producer of the show as the head of &quot;Melman Productions&quot;, although this facet of the character was soon dropped. The character&#x27;s teenage son, Troy &quot;Chipper&quot; Melman (who rarely spoke, and usually just coughed uncontrollably) was seen occasionally alongside his father in various ads.

Outside the pre-taped ads, Melman would sometimes be given odd chores to perform by Letterman, such as handing out hot towels to arrivals at the Port Authority Bus Terminal. At other times, Melman would give pre-scripted answers to unlikely audience questions, or appear unexpectedly to heckle Letterman or the audience. Melman also appeared numerous times as &quot;Kenny The Gardener,&quot; offering dubious gardening advice to home viewers, followed by a song performed in a tuneless-but-enthusiastic style. Occasionally, Melman would just simply wander onto the stage during Letterman&#x27;s monologue as if lost, then leave without saying anything.

A hallmark of the Melman character was his seemingly genuine lack of acting polish. Melman&#x27;s scripted lines were clearly read from cue cards and usually delivered in a forceful shout—but when Letterman or others forced Melman into ad-libbing, the actor&#x27;s naturally more soft-spoken and polite demeanor came to the forefront. Melman routinely flubbed or mangled lines, but gamely persevered with whatever sketch he was in. He was also noted for his remote interviews in which he would ask the interviewee a question, but pitch the microphone to the interviewee too quickly, resulting in the last part of the question being inaudible to Dave and the audience. As a result of his frequent appearances, he became hugely popular with fans of &quot;Late Night&quot;, often being greeted with loud cheers and applause before even speaking.

When Letterman moved from NBC to CBS in 1993, the Melman name was retired, as NBC insisted that the character of &quot;Larry &#x27;Bud&#x27; Melman&quot; was their intellectual property. However, starting from the first edition of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, DeForest continued to play exactly the same character he had played on &quot;Late Night&quot;, now simply using his real name. DeForest often &quot;drew laughs by his bizarre juxtaposition as a &quot;Late Show&quot; correspondent at events such as the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway and the Woodstock anniversary concert that year.&quot; One of DeForest&#x27;s more memorable skits came on Letterman&#x27;s May 13, 1994 show in Los Angeles. The host stated Johnny Carson would announce the evening&#x27;s Top 10 list, at which point DeForest appeared as &quot;Johnny Carson.&quot; Shortly after DeForest&#x27;s exit, the real Johnny Carson appeared in what would prove to be Carson&#x27;s last television appearance.

DeForest continued to appear on Letterman&#x27;s show until his 81st birthday in 2002 before retiring from acting. He had appeared in 15 outside films or TV shows since he began his association with Letterman in 1982.

Letterman noted after DeForest&#x27;s death: &quot;Everyone always wondered if Calvert was an actor playing a character, but in reality he was just himself: a genuine, modest, and nice man. To our staff and to our viewers, he was a beloved and valued part of our show, and we will miss him.&quot; When asked how he would like to be remembered, DeForest responded, &quot;Just being able to make people laugh and knowing people enjoyed my humor. I also hope I haven&#x27;t offended anyone through the years.&quot;

===Other appearances===
He was co-host (in charge of the digital switcher) on the local SF Bay Area radio program, &quot;10@10&quot;, on KFOG with Dave Morey.

In 1985, he appeared in the music video for the Run-DMC song &quot;King of Rock&quot; as a security guard.

In 1989, he appeared in the Special Ed video for the song &quot;Think About It&quot; as the villainous Dr. Norecords.

In 1994, he wrote a humor book called &quot;Cheap Advice&quot;.

In 1994, he appeared in the music video for the Vince Gill song &quot;What The Cowgirls Do&quot; as a cowboy sidekick.

In 1997, he made a cameo appearance in episode 164 of &quot;Wings&quot; (16th episode of the 8th season) entitled &quot;Escape from New York&quot;.

In the late 1990s, he often appeared in various television ads including ones for Tropicana Twister, 1-800-Collect and Little Caesars.

In 1999, he recorded the lounge compilation CD &quot;Calvert DeForest&#x27;s Erotic Experience&quot;, a collection of cover songs, released on October 12, 1999 by Mars Entertainment.

DeForest also appeared on the albums &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; by The Offspring, doing some of the voices that can be heard before and after certain tracks (examples are: “Hand Grenades,” “Change the World,” and “Cocktails”.) In late March 2007, a 20-minute clip of DeForest recording the voices for their album was posted on The Offspring&#x27;s website.

He appeared at Woodstock &#x27;94 to announce Nine Inch Nails&#x27; late night set by proclaiming, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, punch your balls off and please welcome Nine Inch Nails!&quot;

He appeared on the first episode of the 1996 series &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot; on ABC.

He appeared as Rusty in the 1986 episode &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; of the television show &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;.

===Death===
After years of poor health, DeForest died at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, New York, on Long Island, on March 19, 2007. Per his request, no funeral services were held; he was cremated and his remains were interred at Pinelawn Cemetery, Farmingdale, New York. By all press accounts, he left no surviving relatives.

<text>Murray Hill is an unincorporated community located within portions of both Berkeley Heights and New Providence, located in Union County, in the northern portion of the U.S. state of New Jersey.

It is the longtime central location of Bell Labs, having moved there in 1941 from nearby New York City. The first working transistor was demonstrated in Bell Labs&#x27; Murray Hill facility in 1947.

The neighborhood shares its ZIP Code 07974 with the neighboring borough of New Providence.

Murray Hill was named and founded by Carl H. Schultz, founder of a mineral water business once located on First Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets in the Murray Hill district of Manhattan. Schultz purchased a large tract of land there during the 1880s where he built a residence for his family and donated land to be used for a train station with the condition that the area be known as &quot;Murray Hill&quot;.

== Economy ==
Businesses and organizations based in Murray Hill include:
*C. R. Bard, a manufacturer of surgical equipment.
* Bell Labs, pioneering research center that&#x27;s had nine Nobel Prizes awarded to its work.
*The Linde Group&#x27;s (formerly The BOC Group) United States headquarters, the world&#x27;s largest industrial gases company.

==Transportation==
Mass transit to Murray Hill is available via the New Jersey Transit Gladstone Branch train line to the Murray Hill or Summit stations. Passengers heading to Bell Labs can take the 986 bus route to shuttle between the facility and the train station.

<text>The Blues Brothers (formally, The Fabulous Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue) are an American blues and soul revue band founded in 1978 by comedians Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, who met and began collaborating as original cast members of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

The Blues Brothers Musical Revue consisted of lead vocalist &quot;Joliet&quot; Jake Blues (Belushi) and his brother, Elwood (Aykroyd), who played a harmonica that he carried onstage in a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist. The duo were usually dressed in matching black suits, black pencil ties, black trilby hats and sunglasses. The band itself was carefully constructed, and made up of experienced musicians of the time, including Steve &quot;The Colonel&quot; Cropper, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy, &quot;Blue&quot; Lou Marini, Tom &quot;Bones&quot; Malone, and Alan &quot;Mr. Fabulous&quot; Rubin.

The act debuted as musical guest on the April 22, 1978 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, hosted by comedian Steve Martin. After recruiting a full band, the group opened for Martin during a residency at the Universal Amphitheatre in September 1978. Recordings from those performance were released on November 28 as a live album, &quot;Briefcase Full of Blues&quot;. The album rose to the top of the charts and was a platinum seller. Several subsequent albums followed. The act opened for the Grateful Dead at the closing of Winterland Arena in San Francisco, and gained further fame after spawning the comedy film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; in 1980. They remain the most successful blues revue act of all time.

Belushi died in 1982, but the Blues Brothers continued to perform with a rotation of guest singers and other band members. The band re-formed in 1988 for a world tour and again in 1998 for the sequel film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;.

==Band history==
===Origins===

The genesis of the Blues Brothers was a January 17, 1976, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch. In it, &quot;Howard Shore and his All-Bee Band&quot; play the Slim Harpo song &quot;I&#x27;m a King Bee&quot;, with Belushi singing and Aykroyd playing harmonica, dressed in the bee costumes they wore for &quot;The Killer Bees&quot; sketches. In 1978, guitarist Arlen Roth was performing on &quot;SNL&quot; with Art Garfunkel, who was that week&#x27;s host of the show. Before the actual live show, Belushi and Aykroyd asked Roth and others to join them onstage in the outfits that would later become the Blues Brothers&#x27; look. Roth taught Belushi the lyrics to &quot;Rocket 88&quot; so they could perform it that night. This was also discussed on Aykroyd&#x27;s &quot;Elwood&#x27;s Bluesmobile&quot; radio show, when Roth was interviewed about his Slide Guitar Summit album, and the song &quot;Rocket 88&quot;.

Following tapings of &quot;SNL&quot;, it was popular among cast members and the weekly hosts to attend Aykroyd&#x27;s Holland Tunnel Blues bar, which he had rented not long after joining the cast. Aykroyd and Belushi filled a jukebox with songs from Sam &amp; Dave, punk band The Viletones and others. Belushi bought an amplifier and they kept some musical instruments there for anyone who wanted to jam. It was at the bar that Aykroyd and Ron Gwynne wrote and developed the story which Aykroyd turned into the draft screenplay for the &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; movie, better known as the &quot;tome&quot;, because it contained so many pages.

It was also at the bar that Aykroyd introduced Belushi to the blues. An interest soon became a fascination, and it was not long before the two began singing with local blues bands. Jokingly, &quot;SNL&quot; band leader Howard Shore suggested they call themselves &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. In an April 1988, interview he gave to the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Aykroyd said the Blues Brothers act borrowed from Sam and Dave and others; the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; quoted him as explaining: &quot;Well, obviously, the duo thing and the dancing, but the hats came from John Lee Hooker. The suits came from the concept that when you were a jazz player in the &#x27;40s, &#x27;50s &#x27;60s, to look straight, you had to wear a suit.&quot;

The band was modeled in part on Aykroyd&#x27;s experience with the Downchild Blues Band, one of the first professional blues bands in Canada, with whom Aykroyd played on occasion. Aykroyd encountered the band in the early 1970s, around the time of his attendance at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and where his interest in the blues developed through attending and occasionally performing at Ottawa&#x27;s Le Hibou Coffee House. As Aykroyd described it:

The Toronto-based Downchild Blues Band, co-founded in 1969 by two brothers, Donnie and Richard &quot;Hock&quot; Walsh, served as an inspiration for the two Blues Brothers characters. Aykroyd modeled Elwood Blues in part on Donnie Walsh, a harmonica player and guitarist, while Belushi&#x27;s Jake Blues character was modeled after Hock Walsh, Downchild&#x27;s lead singer, and Curtis Salgado. In their first album, &quot;Briefcase Full of Blues&quot; (1978), Aykroyd and Belushi featured three well-known Downchild songs closely associated with Hock Walsh&#x27;s vocal style: &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Everything I Need (Almost)&quot;, written by Donnie Walsh, &quot;Shotgun Blues&quot;, co-written by Donnie and Hock Walsh, and &quot;Flip, Flop and Fly&quot;, co-written and originally popularized by Big Joe Turner. All three songs were on Downchild&#x27;s second album, &quot;Straight Up&quot; (1973), with &quot;Flip, Flop and Fly&quot; becoming the band&#x27;s most successful single, in 1974.

Belushi&#x27;s budding interest in the blues solidified in October 1977 when he was in Eugene, Oregon, filming &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. He went to a local hotel to hear 25-year-old blues singer/harmonica player Curtis Salgado. After the show, Belushi and Salgado talked about the blues for hours. Belushi found Salgado&#x27;s enthusiasm infectious. In an interview at the time with the &quot;Eugene Register-Guard&quot;, he said:

In an interview with &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; he added:

Salgado lent him some albums by Floyd Dixon, Charles Brown, Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson, and others. Belushi was hooked.

In July 2024, John Belushi&#x27;s &quot;Facebook&quot; page revealed that Belushi&#x27;s wife Judith had a prominent role in the development of the Blue Brothers, stating that &quot;Her unwavering dedication and creative genius alongside Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi gave birth to ‘The Blues Brothers.&quot;

Belushi began to join Salgado on stage, singing the Floyd Dixon song &quot;Hey, Bartender&quot; on a few occasions, and using Salgado&#x27;s humorous alternate lyrics to &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;:
These lyrics were used in the band&#x27;s debut performance on &quot;SNL&quot;.

===Band formation===
With the help of pianist-arranger Paul Shaffer, Belushi and Aykroyd started assembling a collection of studio talents to form their own band. These included &quot;SNL&quot; band members saxophonist &quot;Blue&quot; Lou Marini and trombonist-saxophonist Tom Malone, who had previously played in Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. At Shaffer&#x27;s suggestion, guitarist Steve Cropper and bassist Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, the powerhouse combo from Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s and subsequently almost every hit out of Memphis&#x27; Stax Records during the 1960s, were signed as well.

Belushi wanted a powerful trumpet player and a hot blues guitarist, so Juilliard-trained trumpeter Alan Rubin was brought in, as was guitarist Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy, who had performed with many blues legends.

For the brothers&#x27; look, Belushi borrowed John Lee Hooker&#x27;s trademark Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses and soul patch.

===Sound===
In &quot;Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers&quot;, a 1998 documentary included on some DVD editions of the first &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; film, Cropper noted that some of his peers thought that he and the other musicians backing the Blues Brothers were selling out to Hollywood or using a gimmick to make some quick money. Cropper responded by stating that he thought Belushi was as good as (or even better than) many of the singers he had backed; he also noted that Belushi had, early in his career, briefly been a professional drummer, and had an especially keen sense of rhythm.

===Albums, early gigs, character backgrounds===
The Blues Brothers recorded their first album, &quot;Briefcase Full of Blues&quot;, in 1978 while opening for comedian Steve Martin at Los Angeles&#x27; Universal Amphitheatre. The album reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, went double platinum, and featured Top 40 hit recordings of Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;Soul Man&quot; and The Chips&#x27; &quot;Rubber Biscuit&quot;.

The album liner notes fleshed out the fictional backstory of Jake and Elwood, having them growing up in a Roman Catholic orphanage in Rock Island, Illinois and learning the blues from a janitor named Curtis. Their blood brotherhood was sealed by cutting their middle fingers with a string said to come from the guitar of Elmore James.

The band, along with the New Riders of the Purple Sage, opened for the Grateful Dead for the final show at Winterland, New Year&#x27;s Eve 1978.

With the film came the soundtrack album, which was the band&#x27;s first studio album. &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27; was a Top 40 hit and the band toured to promote the film. The tour began on June 27, 1980 at Poplar Creek Music Theater. The tour also led to a third album (and second live album), &quot;Made in America&quot;, recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track &quot;Who&#x27;s Making Love&quot; peaked at No 39. It was the last recording the band would make with Belushi&#x27;s Jake Blues.

Belushi&#x27;s wife, Judith Jacklin, and his friend, Tino Insana, wrote a book, &quot;Blues Brothers: Private&quot;, that further fleshed out the Blues Brothers&#x27; universe and gave a back story for the first movie.

In 1981, &quot;Best of the Blues Brothers&quot; was released, with a previously unreleased track, a version of The Soul Survivors&#x27; &quot;Expressway to Your Heart&quot;, and alternate live recordings of &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;Rubber Biscuit&quot;; this album would be the first of several compilations and hits collections issued over the years. A 1998 British CD compilation, &quot;The Complete Blues Brothers&quot;, exclusively featured The Lamont Cranston Band&#x27;s &quot;Excuse Moi Mon Cheri&quot;, from the L.A. &quot;Briefcase&quot; recordings, originally available only as the b-side to the &quot;Soul Man&quot; 45 rpm single.

On March 5, 1982, Belushi died in Hollywood of an accidental overdose of heroin and cocaine.

After Belushi&#x27;s death, updated versions of the Blues Brothers have performed on &quot;SNL&quot; and for charitable and political causes. Aykroyd has been accompanied by Jim Belushi and John Goodman in character as &quot;Zee&quot; Blues and &quot;Mighty Mack&quot; McTeer. The copyright owners have also authorized some copycat acts to perform under the Blues Brothers name; one such act performs regularly at the Universal Studios Florida theme park in Orlando, Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood.

In 1995, the Band collaborated with the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari, who had been invited to the event in memory of John Belushi&#x27;s 46th birthday. After a concert together, they registered the videoclip of the Zucchero song &quot;Per colpa di chi?&quot; at the House of Blues.
In 1997, an animated sitcom with Jake and Elwood was planned, but scrapped after only eight episodes were produced. Peter Aykroyd and Jim Belushi replaced their brothers as the voices of Elwood and Jake.

To promote &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1998), Dan Aykroyd, Jim Belushi and John Goodman performed at the Super Bowl XXXI halftime show, along with ZZ Top and James Brown. The performance was preceded with a faux news report stating the Blues Brothers had escaped custody and were on their way to the Louisiana Superdome.

Aykroyd has continued to be an active proponent of blues music and parlayed this avocation into foundation and partial ownership of the House of Blues franchise, a national chain of nightclubs. In Italy the franchise is now owned by Zucchero, who used the brand during the tour promoting his album &quot;Black Cat&quot; of 2016.

Jim Belushi toured with the band for a short time as &quot;Zee Blues&quot;, and recorded the album &quot;Blues Brothers and Friends: Live from Chicago&#x27;s House of Blues&quot; with Dan Aykroyd. Jim would later reunite with Aykroyd to record yet another album, not as the Blues Brothers but as themselves: &quot;Belushi/Aykroyd – Have Love Will Travel&quot; (Big Men-Big Music).

In 2004, the showband revue &quot;The Blues Brothers Revival&quot; premiered in Chicago. The story was about Elwood trying to rescue Jake from an eternity in limbo/purgatory. The revue was written and composed with approval and permission from both the John Belushi estate (including his widow, Judith Belushi-Pisano) and Dan Aykroyd.

The Blues Brothers featuring Elwood and Zee regularly perform at House of Blues venues and various casinos across North America. They are usually backed by Jim Belushi&#x27;s Sacred Hearts Band. The Original Blues Brothers Band tours the world regularly. The only original members still in the band are Steve Cropper and Lou Marini. The lead singers are Bobby &quot;Sweet Soul&quot; Harden, Rob &quot;The Honeydripper&quot; Papparozi and Tommy &quot;Pipes&quot; McDonnel. They are occasionally joined by Eddie Floyd.

Aykroyd most recently hosted a radio show as his character Elwood Blues on the weekly &quot;House of Blues Radio Hour&quot;, heard nationwide on the Dial Global Radio Network until 2017. It has now been succeeded by &quot;The Sam T. Blues Revue&quot;, which airs Wednesday nights on KHBT.

==Films==
===&quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;===
In 1980, The Blues Brothers, directed by John Landis, was released. It featured epic car chases involving the Bluesmobile and musical performances by Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles and John Lee Hooker. The story is set in and around Chicago, Illinois. It is a tale of redemption for the paroled convict Jake Blues and his brother Elwood, who after a visit to Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), otherwise known as &quot;The Penguin&quot; at the Catholic orphanage where they grew up, choose to take on a &quot;mission from God&quot; and re-form their old blues band in order to raise funds to save the orphanage. Along the way, the brothers are targeted by a &quot;mystery woman&quot; (Carrie Fisher) and chased by the Illinois State Police, a country and western band called the Good Ol&#x27; Boys, and &quot;Illinois Nazis&quot;. The film grossed $57 million domestically in its theatrical release, making it the 10th highest-grossing movie of 1980, and grossed an additional $58 million in foreign release.

===&quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;===

With Landis again directing, the sequel to &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; was made in 1998. It fared considerably worse than its predecessor with fans and critics, though it is more ambitious in terms of musical performances by the band and has a more extensive roster of guest artists than the first film. The story picks up 18 years later with Elwood being released from prison, and learning that his brother has died. He is once again prevailed upon to save some orphans, and with a 10-year-old boy named Buster Blues (J. Evan Bonifant) in tow, Elwood again sets about the task of reuniting his band. He recruits some new singers, Mighty Mack (John Goodman) and Cab (Joe Morton), a policeman who was Curtis&#x27; son. All the original band members are found, as well as some performers from the first film, including Aretha Franklin and James Brown. There are dozens of other guest performers, including Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Junior Wells, Lonnie Brooks, Eddie Floyd, Wilson Pickett, Isaac Hayes, Sam Moore, Taj Mahal and Jonny Lang, Blues Traveler, as well as an all-star supergroup led by B.B. King called the Louisiana Gator Boys. On the run from the police, Russian mafia and a racist militia, the band eventually ends up in Louisiana, where they enter a Battle of the Bands overseen by a voodoo practitioner named Queen Moussette (Erykah Badu). During a song by the Blues Brothers (a Caribbean number called &quot;Funky Nassau&quot;), a character played by Paul Shaffer asks to cut in on keyboards, which Murph allows. This marks the first time in a film that the Blues Brothers play with their original keyboardist.

==Full stage musical==

The Blues Brothers Musical 

In 2020, the first Blues Brothers full stage musical premiered in Tauranga, New Zealand. Written and directed by New Zealand writers Gordy Lockhart and Liam Hagan and produced by Tauranga Musical Theatre, Lockhart and Hagan spent years in discussions with Judy Belushi prior to signing an agreement with Belushi and Aykroyd to use Blues Brothers intellectual property. 
The main task of the writers was to create a stage show based on a new storyline as complications with rights ownership meant the original movie script could not be adapted for the stage. The result was The Blues Brothers - First Contact. 

The Blues Brothers - First Contact

&quot;Show Synopsis&quot;

Jake and Elwood Blues are conditionally released from Joliet Detention Facility and are conscripted to the US military on direct orders from the Commander in Chief. 

Five years previously, SETI Project Scientists detected a faint signal from Gamma Proteous 5 in the Carina Nebula. Now, in a highly classified CIA led operation, First Contact and the arrival of alien visitors on Planet Earth is scheduled for 7-23pm on Tuesday 24th August at Area 56 in the Dark Mountains of Global Region Echo. 

However, the President has intelligence that suggests the morale of American forces, Joint Special Forces Operations Command (JSOC), based at Area 56 are at an all-time low.
POTUS believes that following five years of arduous preparation far from home, the appalling quality of entertainment at the region&#x27;s main base to be the core of the issue. 

His solution? He instructs the Joint Chiefs to find the only musical act that has a hope of raising morale, so saving the world and developing intergalactic relations.

<text>Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City, bordering the Lower East Side to its east, Little Italy to its north, Civic Center to its south, and Tribeca to its west. With an estimated population of 90,000 to 100,000 people, Chinatown is home to the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere. Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown is also one of the oldest Chinese ethnic enclaves. The Manhattan Chinatown is one of nine Chinatown neighborhoods in New York City, as well as one of twelve in the New York metropolitan area, which contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, comprising an estimated 893,697 uniracial individuals as of 2017.

Chinatown is also a densely populated neighborhood, with over 141,000 residents living in its vicinity encompassing 1.7 square miles, &quot;of which 28.1% identified as Asian&quot; in 2023. Historically, Chinatown was primarily populated by Cantonese speakers. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, large numbers of Fuzhounese-speaking immigrants also arrived and formed a sub-neighborhood annexed to the eastern portion of Chinatown east of The Bowery, which has become known as Little Fuzhou subdivided away from the primarily Cantonese populated original longtime established Chinatown of Manhattan from the proximity of The Bowery going west, known as Little Hong Kong/Guangdong. As many Fuzhounese and Cantonese speakers now speak Mandarin—the official language in Mainland China and Taiwan—in addition to their native languages, this has made it more important for Chinatown residents to learn and speak Mandarin. Although now overtaken in size by the rapidly growing Flushing Chinatown (located in the New York City borough of Queens) and Brooklyn Chinatown, the Manhattan Chinatown remains a dominant cultural force for the Chinese diaspora, as home to the Museum of Chinese in America and as the headquarters of numerous publications based both in the U.S. and China that are geared to overseas Chinese.

Chinatown is part of Manhattan Community District 3, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10013 and 10002. It is patrolled by the 5th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==Location==

Although a New York Business Improvement District has been identified for support, Chinatown has no officially defined borders. The following streets are commonly considered the approximate borders:
* Hester Street or Grand Street to the north, bordering or overlapping Little Italy
* Worth Street to the southwest, bordering Civic Center
* East Broadway to the southeast, bordering Two Bridges
* Essex Street to the east, bordering the Lower East Side
* Lafayette Street to the west, bordering Tribeca

The historic core of Chinatown is bounded by Chatham Square/Bowery, Worth, Baxter, and Canal. Mott (south of Canal), Mulberry, Bayard, Pell, Doyers, and Worth were settled by Chinese immigrants starting in the 1870s. The local branch of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association was founded at 10 Chatham Square in 1883 and later moved to the building at 16 Mott Street, now considered the &quot;City Hall of Chinatown&quot;.
==Citywide demographics==
The Manhattan Chinatown is one of nine Chinatown neighborhoods in New York City, as well as one of twelve in the New York metropolitan area, which contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, enumerating an estimated 779,269 individuals as of 2013; the remaining Chinatowns are located in the boroughs of Queens (up to four, depending upon definition) and Brooklyn (three) and in Nassau County, all on Long Island in New York State; as well as in Edison and Parsippany-Troy Hills in New Jersey. In addition, Manhattan&#x27;s Little Fuzhou, an enclave populated primarily by more recent Chinese immigrants from the Fujian Province of China, is technically considered a part of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, albeit now developing a separate identity of its own.

A new and rapidly growing Chinese community in East Harlem, Uptown Manhattan, nearly tripled in population between the years 2000 and 2010, according to U.S. Census figures. This neighborhood has been described as the precursor to a new satellite Chinatown within Manhattan itself, which upon acknowledged formation would represent the second Chinese neighborhood in Manhattan, the tenth large Chinese settlement in New York City, and the twelfth within the overall New York City metropolitan region.

As the city proper with the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia by a wide margin, estimated at 628,763 as of 2017, and as the primary destination for new Chinese immigrants, New York City is subdivided into official municipal boroughs, which themselves are home to significant Chinese populations, with Brooklyn and Queens, adjacently located on Long Island, leading the fastest growth. After the City of New York itself, the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn encompass the largest Chinese populations, respectively, of all municipalities in the United States.

==History==

===Ah Ken and early Chinese immigration===

Ah Ken is claimed to have arrived in the area during the 1850s; he is the first Chinese person credited as having permanently immigrated to Chinatown. As a Cantonese businessman, Ah Ken eventually founded a successful cigar store on Park Row. He first arrived around 1858 in New York City, where he was &quot;probably one of those Chinese mentioned in gossip of the sixties [1860s] as peddling &#x27;awful&#x27; cigars at three cents apiece from little stands along the City Hall park fence – offering a paper spill and a tiny oil lamp as a lighter&quot;, according to author Alvin Harlow in &quot;Old Bowery Days: The Chronicles of a Famous Street&quot; (1931).

In the 1850s, the California Gold Rush brought a wave of Chinese immigration to the United States. Approximately 25,000 Chinese immigrants left their homes in search for &quot;gam saan&quot; (&quot;gold mountain&quot;) in California. In New York, immigrants found work as &quot;cigar men&quot; or carrying billboards, and Ah Ken&#x27;s particular success encouraged cigar makers William Longford, John Occoo, and John Ava to also ply their trade in Chinatown, eventually forming a monopoly on the cigar trade. It has been speculated that it may have been Ah Ken who kept a small boarding house on lower Mott Street and rented out bunks to the first Chinese immigrants to arrive in Chinatown. It was with the profits he earned as a landlord, earning an average of $100 per month, that he was able to open his Park Row smoke shop around which modern-day Chinatown would grow.

===Chinese exclusion period===
In 1873, the United States entered a period of economic difficulty known as the Long Depression. As a result, Americans increasingly competed for jobs that were typically performed by Chinese immigrants. The period was marked by increased racial discrimination, anti-Chinese riots (particularly in California), and new laws that prevented participation in many occupations on the U.S. West Coast. Consequently, many Chinese immigrants moved to the East Coast cities in search of employment.

Early businesses in East Coast cities included hand laundries and restaurants. Chinatown started on Mott, Park (now Mosco), Pell, and Doyers Streets, east of the notorious Five Points district. By 1870 there was a Chinese population of 200. By 1882, when the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed, the population was up to 2,000 residents. In 1900, the US Census reported 7,028 Chinese males in residence, but only 142 Chinese women. This significant gender inequality remained until the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and C. Cindy Fan, authors of &quot;Growth and Decline of Muslim Hui Enclaves in Beijing&quot;, wrote that because of immigration restrictions, Chinatown continued to be &quot;virtually a bachelor society&quot; until 1965.

The early days of Chinatown were dominated by Chinese &quot;tongs&quot; (now sometimes rendered neutrally as &quot;associations&quot;), which were a mixture of clan associations, landsman&#x27;s associations, political alliances (Kuomintang (Nationalists) vs Chinese Communist Party), and more secretly, crime syndicates. The associations started to give protection from anti-Chinese harassment. Each of these associations was aligned with a street gang. The associations were a source of assistance to new immigrants, giving out loans, aiding in starting businesses, and so forth. The associations formed a governing body named the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. Though this body was meant to foster relations between the Tongs, open warfare periodically flared between the &quot;On Leong&quot; and &quot;Hip Sing&quot; tongs. Much of the Chinese gang warfare took place on Doyers street. Gangs like the &quot;Ghost Shadows&quot; and &quot;Flying Dragons&quot; were prevalent until the 1990s. The Chinese gangs controlled certain territories of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown. The &quot;On Leong&quot; and its affiliate &quot;Ghost Shadows&quot; were of Cantonese and Toishan descent, and controlled Mott, Bayard, Canal, and Mulberry Streets. The &quot;Flying Dragons&quot; and its affiliate &quot;Hip Sing&quot; also of Cantonese and Toishan descent controlled Doyers, Pell, Bowery, Grand, and Hester Streets. Other Chinese gangs also existed, like the Hung Ching and Chih Kung gangs of Cantonese and Toishan descent, which were affiliated with each other and also gained control of Mott Street. &quot;Born to Kill&quot;, also known as the &quot;Canal Boys&quot;, a gang composed almost entirely of Vietnamese immigrants from the Vietnam War under the leadership of David Thai had control over Broadway, Canal, Baxter, Centre, and Lafayette Streets. Fujianese gangs also existed, such as the Tung On gang, which affiliated with Tsung Tsin, and had control over East Broadway, Catherine and Division Streets and the Fuk Ching gang affiliated with Fukien American controlled East Broadway, Chrystie, Forsyth, Eldridge, and Allen Streets. At one point, a gang named the Freemasons gang, which was of Cantonese descent, had attempted to claim East Broadway as its territory.

Columbus Park, the only park in Chinatown, was built in 1897 on what was once the center of the infamous Five Points neighborhood. During the 19th century, this was the most dangerous ghetto area of immigrant New York, as portrayed in the book and film &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;.

===Post-1965 reform===
In the years after the United States enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, allowing many more immigrants from Asia into the country, the population of Chinatown increased dramatically. Geographically, much of the growth occurred in neighborhoods to the north. The Chinatown grew and became more oriented toward families due to the lifting of restrictions. In the earliest years of the existence of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, it had been primarily populated by Taishanese-speaking Chinese immigrants and the borderlines of the enclave was originally Canal Street to the north, Bowery to the east, Worth Street to the south, and Mulberry Street to the west.

====Influx of immigrants from Hong Kong and Guangdong====
After 1965, there came a wave of Cantonese speakers from Hong Kong and Guangdong province in mainland China, and Standard Cantonese became the dominant tongue. With the influx of Hong Kong immigrants, it was developing and growing into a Hong Kongese neighborhood, however the growth slowed down later on during the 1980s–90s.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, the influx of Guangdong and Hong Kong immigrants began to develop newer portions of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown going north of Canal Street and then later the east of the Bowery. However, until the 1980s, the western section was the most primarily fully Chinese developed and populated part of Chinatown and the most quickly flourishing busy central Chinese business district with still a little bit of remaining Italians in the very northwest portion around Grand Street and Broome Street, which eventually all moved away and became all Chinese by the 1990s. Although the portion of Chinatown that is east of the Bowery—which is considered part of the Lower East Side already started developing as being part of Chinatown since the influx of Chinese immigrants started spilling over into that section since the 1960s, however until the 1980s, it was still not developing as quickly as the western portion of Chinatown because the proportion and concentration of Chinese residents in the eastern section during that time was comparatively growing at a slower rate and being more scattered than the western section in addition to the fact that there was a higher proportion of remaining non-Chinese residents consisting of Jewish, Puerto Ricans, and a few Italians and African Americans than Chinatown&#x27;s western section.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the eastern portion of Chinatown east of the Bowery was a very quiet section, and despite fears of crime, it was seen as attractive because of the availability of vacant affordable apartments. Chinese female garment workers were especially targets of crime and often left work together to protect each other as they were heading home. In May 1985, a gang-related shooting injured seven people, including a 4-year-old boy, at 30 East Broadway in Chinatown. Two males, who were 15 and 16 years old and were members of a Chinese street gang, were arrested and convicted.

Many Chinese Vietnamese, Laotian Chinese, Chinese Cambodians, and Malaysian Chinese immigrants also settled into the neighborhood as well.

Starting in the 1970s, Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese immigrants and then many other Non-Cantonese Chinese immigrants also were arriving into New York City. However, due to the traditional dominance of Cantonese-speaking residents, which were largely working class in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown and the neighborhood&#x27;s poor housing conditions, they were unable to relate to Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown and mainly settled in Flushing, creating a more middle class Mandarin Town and an even smaller one in Elmhurst. As a result, Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown and Brooklyn&#x27;s emerging Chinatown were able to continue retaining its traditional, almost-exclusive Cantonese society. However, there was already a small and slow-growing Fuzhou immigrant population in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown since the 1970s–80s in the eastern section of Chinatown east of the Bowery. In the 1990s, though, Chinese people began to move into some parts of the western Lower East Side, which 50 years earlier was populated by Eastern European Jews and 20 years earlier was occupied by Hispanics.

====Little Fuzhou====
From the late 1980s through the 1990s, when a large influx of immigrants from Fuzhou, who largely also spoke Mandarin along with their native Fuzhou dialect began moving into New York City, they were the only exceptional group of Chinese that were non-Cantonese to largely settle into Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown. Due to the fact that the Chinatown area were mostly populated by Cantonese speakers, the Fuzhou speaking immigrants had a lot of trouble relating to the neighborhood linguistically and culturally and as a result, they settled on the eastern borderline of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown east of The Bowery, which during that time was more of an overlapping population of Chinese, Puerto Ricans, and Jewish as well as had significant vacant apartment units and were more affordable than in the more Mandarin-speaking enclaves in Flushing and Elmhurst, and many Fuzhou immigrants had no legal status and being forced into the lowest paying jobs. As they settled in the eastern borderline of Chinatown along East Broadway and Eldridge Street, it became fully part of Chinatown and slowly through the 1990s it would develop into being Little Fuzhou. This has resulted in referring to East Broadway as Fuzhou Street No. 1, which emerged during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Eldridge Street as Fuzhou Street No. 2, which developed during the mid-1990s and early 2000s. Little Fuzhou became known as a new Chinatown, separate from the older, more Cantonese-dominated Chinatown from The Bowery going west, though there are still a little bit of remaining long time Cantonese residents and businesses in and around what is now the Little Fuzhou enclave.

Not only did the Fuzhou immigration influx establish a new portion of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, they contributed significantly in maintaining the Chinese population in the neighborhood. They also played a role in property values increasing quickly during the 1990s, in contrast to during the 1980s, when the housing prices were dropping. As a result, landlords were able to generate twice as much income in Manhattan&#x27;s, Flushing&#x27;s, and Brooklyn&#x27;s Chinatowns.

Since the 2010s, gentrification has been setting into the Chinatown neighborhood including the Little Fuzhou enclave. Large numbers of Fuzhou speakers have been rapidly moving out of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown with many shifting to Brooklyn&#x27;s Chinatown in Sunset Park, which has now overwhelmingly taken over as the largest Fuzhou community of New York City. Many Fuzhou owned businesses have now closed with increasing numbers of storefronts becoming vacant in the enclave and is now increasingly becoming quieter with fewer and fewer consumers walking around.

====Migration to Brooklyn Chinatown====
The increasing Fuzhou influx had shifted into the Brooklyn Chinatown in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. This shift replaces the Cantonese population throughout Brooklyn&#x27;s Sunset Park Chinatown significantly more rapidly than in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown. Gentrification in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown has slowed the growth of Fuzhou immigration as well as the growth of Chinese immigrants to Manhattan in general, which is why New York City&#x27;s rapidly growing Chinese population has now shifted primarily to the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.

Some Chinese landlords in Manhattan, especially the many real estate agencies that are mainly of Cantonese ownership, were accused of prejudice against the Fuzhou immigrants, supposedly making Fuzhou immigrants feel unwelcome because concerns that they would not be able to pay rent or debt to gangs that may have helped smuggled them in illegally into the United States, and because of fear that gangs will come up to the apartments to cause trouble. There is also supposedly a concern that Fujianese are more likely to make the apartments too overcrowded by subdividing an apartment into multiple small spaces to rent to other Fuzhou immigrants. This could also be particularly seen on East Broadway.

Although Mandarin is spoken as a native language among only 10 percent of Chinese speakers in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, it is used as a secondary dialect among the greatest number of them. Although Min Chinese, especially the Fuzhou dialect, is spoken natively by a third of the Chinese population in the city, it is not used as a lingua franca because speakers of other dialect groups do not learn Min.

====Little Hong Kong/Guangdong====
As the epicenter of the massive Fuzhou influx has shifted to Brooklyn in the 2000s, Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown&#x27;s Cantonese population remains viable and large and successfully continues to retain its stable Cantonese community identity, maintaining the communal gathering venue established decades ago in the western portion of Chinatown, to shop, work, and socialize—in contrast to the Cantonese population and community identity which are shifting from Brooklyn&#x27;s original Sunset Park Chinatown to the satellite Chinatowns in Brooklyn.

Although the term Little Hong Kong was used a long time ago to describe Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown relating to when an influx of Hong Kong immigrants was pouring in at that time and even though not all Cantonese immigrants come from Hong Kong, this portion of Chinatown has heavy Cantonese characteristics, especially with the Standard Cantonese, which is spoken in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China being widely used, so it is in many ways a &quot;Little Hong Kong&quot;.

A more appropriate term would be Little Guangdong-Hong Kong or Cantonese-Hong Kong Town since the Cantonese immigrants do come from different regions of the Guangdong province of China including Hong Kong. The long-time established Cantonese Community, which can be considered Little Hong Kong/Guang Dong or known as the Old Chinatown of Manhattan lies along Mott, Pell, Doyer, Bayard, Elizabeth, Mulberry, Canal, and Bowery Streets, within Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown.

Newer satellite Little Guangdong-Hong Kong has started to emerge in sections of Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay/Homecrest in Brooklyn. However, there are more scattered and mixed in with other ethnic enclaves. This is a result of many Cantonese residents migrating to these neighborhoods. Bensonhurst carries the majority of Brooklyn&#x27;s Cantonese enclaves/population. Originally, the Sunset Park Chinatown was a small satellite of Manhattan&#x27;s Western Cantonese Chinatown, but since the 2000s, Cantonese speakers in Brooklyn have been largely shifting to and concentrating in Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay/Homecrest while the Sunset Park Chinatown has largely grown into being a very large Fuzhou speaking enclave.

====Fuzhounese-Cantonese relations====
The Fuzhou immigration pattern started out in the 1970s, like the Cantonese immigration during the late 1800s to early 1900s that had established Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown on Mott Street, Pell Street, and Doyers Street. The immigrants were initially mostly men who later brought their families over. The beginning influx of Fuzhou immigrants arriving during the 1980s and 1990s were entering into a Chinese community that was extremely Cantonese dominated. Due to the Fuzhou immigrants having no legal status and inability to speak Cantonese, many were denied jobs in Chinatown as a result, causing many of them to resort to crimes. There was a lot of Cantonese resentment against Fuzhou immigrants arriving into Chinatown.

==Demographics and culture==

In 2000, most of Chinatown&#x27;s residents came from Asia. That year, the number of residents was 84,840, and 66% of them were Asian.

===Demographics===
The census tabulation area for Chinatown is bounded to the north by Houston Street; to the east by Avenue B, Norfolk Street, Essex Street and Pike Street; to the south by Frankfort Street; and to the west by Centre Street and Bowery. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Chinatown was 47,844, a change of −4,531 (−9.5%) from the 52,375 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 16.3% (7,817) White, 4.8% (2,285) African American, 0.1% (38) Native American, 63.9% (30,559) Asian, 0% (11) Pacific Islander, 0.2% (75) from other races, and 1.3% (639) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.4% (6,420) of the population.

The racial composition of Chinatown changed substantially from 2000 to 2010, with the most significant changes being the increase in the White population by 42% (2,321), the decrease in the Asian population by 15% (5,461), and the decrease in the Hispanic / Latino population by 15% (1,121). The Black population decreased by 3% (62) and remained a small minority, while the very small population of all other races decreased by 21% (208).

Chinatown lies in Manhattan Community District 3, which encompasses Chinatown, the East Village, and the Lower East Side. Community District 3 had 171,103 residents as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 82.2 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most residents are adults: a plurality (35%) are between the ages of 25 and 44, while 25% are between 45 and 64, and 16% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 13% and 11%, respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 3 was $39,584. In 2018, an estimated 18% of Community District 3 residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twelve residents (8%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 48% in Community District 3, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 3 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010.

The New York City Department of City Planning released updated 2020 census data on the Asian population of New York City. Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown has only 27,200 Asian residents, compared to the neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn (46,000); Sunset Park, Brooklyn (31,400); Flushing, Queens (54,200); and Elmhurst, Queens (55,800).

===Chinese cultural standards===
Despite the more recently emerged large Fuzhou population, many of the Chinese businesses in Chinatown are still Cantonese owned. The Cantonese dominated western section of Chinatown also continues to be the main busy Chinese business district. As a result, it has influenced many Fuzhounese to learn Cantonese for businesses, especially large businesses like the Dim Sum restaurants on what is known as Little Fuzhou on East Broadway. The Fuzhounese, the subgroup of non-Cantonese-speaking Chinese with the most interactions with Cantonese, also constitute the majority of non-native Cantonese-speaking Chinese. Many of the Fuzhou immigrants in the 1980s and early 1990s learned to speak Cantonese to maintain jobs and communicate with the Cantonese-speaking population in addition to the fact many of the earlier Fuzhou immigrants had lived in Hong Kong adapting into the Hong Kong culture and speaking Cantonese, which gave them better advantages to integrating into the Chinatown community as it was still very dominantly Cantonese speaking. However, since the 2000s, newer Chinese immigrants have largely spoken Mandarin Chinese, the national language of China.

A significant difference between the two separate Chinese provincial communities in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown is that the Cantonese part of Chinatown not only serves Chinese customers but is also a tourist attraction. However, the Fuzhou part of Chinatown caters less to tourists. Bowery, Chrystie Street, Catherine Street, and Chatham Square encompass the approximate border zone between the Fuzhou and Cantonese communities in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown.

Unlike most other urban Chinatowns, Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown is both a residential area as well as commercial area. Many population estimates are in the range of 90,000 to 100,000 residents. One analysis of census data in 2011 showed that Chinatown and heavily Chinese tracts on the Lower East Side had 47,844 residents in the 2010 census, a decrease of nearly 9% since 2000.

===Gentrification and decline in Chinese population===

By 2007, luxury condominiums began to spread from SoHo into Chinatown. Previously, Chinatown was noted for its crowded tenements and primarily Chinese residents. While some projects have targeted the Chinese community, the development of luxury housing has increased Chinatown&#x27;s economic and cultural diversity. A 2021 N.Y.U Furman poll found that the racial and ethnic composition of Asian identifying individuals within the community dropped from 34.8% in 2000 to 28.1% in 2021, a 6.7% decrease

Since the early 2000s, there has been a continuously increasing number of buildings in Chinatown, neighboring Two Bridges, and the Lower East Side, taken over by new landlords and real estate developers, who then charged higher rents and/or demolished the buildings to build newer structures. Often, whenever this happens, many Fuzhounese tenants are more likely to be evicted, especially in the eastern portion of Chinatown, where illegal subdivision, overcrowding, lack of leases, and lack of immigrant paperwork are common. In addition, since the 2000s, there have been city officials inspecting apartment buildings and cracking down on illegal units. With tenants that have rent-stabilized leases, legal residency documents, no apartment subdivisions, and a lesser probability of subletting over capacity—most of whom are long-time Cantonese residents—it is usually harder for the newer landlords to be able to force these tenants out, especially including the western portion of Chinatown, which is still mainly Cantonese populated. However, newer landlords still continuously try find other loopholes to force them out.

By 2009, many newer Chinese immigrants settled along East Broadway instead of the historic core west of Bowery. In addition Mandarin began to eclipse Cantonese as the predominant Chinese dialect in New York&#x27;s Chinatown during the period. &quot;The New York Times&quot; says that the Flushing Chinatown now rivals Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown in terms of being a cultural center for Chinese-speaking New Yorkers&#x27; politics and trade.

====Current status as Chinese shopping business district====
Despite the area&#x27;s gentrification, it is still a popular Chinese commercial shopping district, frequented by residents of the New York metropolitan area as well as tourists. In addition, high-income professionals are moving into the area and patronizing Chinese businesses. However, commercial activity is not concentrated evenly through Chinatown. The western half of Chinatown (the original Cantonese Chinatown), known as Little Hong Kong/Guangdong, is still relatively active. However, the eastern/southern part of Chinatown, known as Little Fuzhou, has become primarily residential, and thus, the most primarily affected by the decline in business. Businesses in Little Fuzhou may be affected by the spread of gentrification from the nearby Lower East Side and East Village.

In 2016, the oldest continuously run business in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown was up for sale: Wing on Wo and Co, established in 1890. The building was worth around $10 million, including six stories and a store front, one of the only buildings left of its kind in the area. Mei Lum, a grandchild of the original owner, stepped in before the sale and took over the business to preserve its history and position within the neighborhood, to &quot;regenerate, encourage and protect&quot; Chinatown&#x27;s culture. Lum started the &quot;W.O.W. Project&quot;, which hopes to &quot;preserve Chinatown&#x27;s creative scene through art and activism&quot;. Events such as Open Mic nights and exhibitions would start conversations about this neighborhood&#x27;s past and the people that have lived there. For example, in February 2020, the W.O.W. Project exhibited ethnographic research and oral history interviews that highlighted stories of migration, displacement, and everyday resilience in Chinatowns all over the world. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the W.O.W. Project started a project called Love Letters to Chinatown.

== Streetscape==
==Economy==

Chinese greengrocers and fishmongers are clustered around Mott Street, Mulberry Street, Canal Street (by Baxter Street), and all along East Broadway (especially by Catherine Street). The Chinese jewelers&#x27; district is on Canal Street between Mott and Bowery. There are many Asian and American banks in the neighborhood. Canal Street, west of Broadway (especially on the Northside), is filled with street vendors selling knock-off brands of perfumes, watches, and handbags. This section of Canal Street was previously the home of warehouse stores selling surplus/salvage electronics and hardware.

In addition, tourism and restaurants are major industries. The district boasts many historical and cultural attractions, and it is a destination for tour companies like Manhattan Walking Tour, Big Onion, NYC Chinatown Tours, and Lower East Side History Project. Tour stops often include landmarks like the Church of the Transfiguration and the Lin Zexu and Confucius statues. The enclave&#x27;s many restaurants also support the tourism industry. In Chinatown, more than 300 Chinese restaurants provide employment. Notable and well-reviewed Chinatown establishments include Joe&#x27;s Shanghai, Jing Fong, New Green Bo and Amazing 66.

Other contributors to the economy include factories. The proximity of the fashion industry has kept some garment work in the local area, though much of the garment industry has since moved to China. The local garment industry now concentrates on quick production in small volumes and piece work, which is generally done at the worker&#x27;s home. Much of the population growth is due to immigration.

The September 11, 2001 attacks caused a decline in business for stores and restaurants in Chinatown. Chinatown was adversely affected by the attacks; being so physically close to Ground Zero, Chinatown saw a very slow return of tourism and business. Part of the reason was the NYPD closure of Park Row, one of two major roads linking the Financial District with Chinatown (the other being Centre Street). However, the area&#x27;s economy, as well as tourism, have rebounded since then. A Chinatown business improvement district was established in 2011 despite opposition from business owners in the community.

The neighborhood is home to several large Chinese supermarkets. In August 2011, a new branch of New York Supermarket opened on Mott Street in the central district of grocery and food shopping of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown. Just a block away from New York Supermarket, is a Hong Kong Supermarket located on the corner of Elizabeth and Hester Streets. These two supermarkets are among the largest Chinese supermarkets carrying all different food varieties within the long-time established Cantonese community in the western section of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown. A Hong Kong Supermarket at East Broadway and Pike Street burned down in 2009 and plans to construct a 91-room Marriott Hotel in its place resulted in community protests. The New York Supermarkets chain, which also operates markets in Elmhurst and Flushing, settled with the New York State Attorney General in 2008 in which it paid back wages and overtime to workers. Many of the Chinese restaurant menus in the U.S. are printed in Chinatown, Manhattan.

Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown has had a history of mini malls with varieties of small shops, however due to the gentrification, this trend has been declining. However, two significant well known mini malls in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown still exist and stand out the most, which are Elizabeth Center at &quot;13 Elizabeth Street&quot; right next to NYPD&#x27;s 5th precinct and East Broadway Mall at &quot;88 East Broadway&quot; under the Manhattan Bridge. Elizabeth Center is a Hong Kong style shopping center with varieties of shops with most of them being owned by Cantonese speakers along with some owned by other Chinese speakers as well and is located in the longer time established western Cantonese Chinatown, therefore their customer base are largely Cantonese speakers from the local neighborhoods as well as from other places, however other Chinese speakers from the local area and from other places including Chinese tourists also come to shop at this mini mall. Elizabeth Center also attracts a lot of Non-Asian tourists and visitors and it is often very popular with younger generation customers of Chinese and non-Chinese descents due to the significant concentration of stores that sell varieties of affordable accessories as well as cartoon figure and Action figure products.

East Broadway Mall, at 88 East Broadway, was developed in the late 1980s on a city-owned plot of land under the Manhattan Bridge. When East Broadway Mall opened, their storefront owners and customer base were mainly Cantonese speakers as the Chinese speaking population in the area was still very Cantonese speaking, however as early as the 1980s, a Fuzhouese-speaking population already had begun growing in the East Broadway neighborhood, which eventually by the 1990s had slowly grown into a Fuzhou speaking enclave distinct from the original older established Cantonese Chinatown from Bowery Street going west and then reflectively the storefront owners and customer base at East Broadway Mall then slowly shifted to majority Fuzhou speakers. The area&#x27;s Fuzhouese-speaking population has been declining since the 2010s due to gentrification, and many residents relocated to New York City&#x27;s outer boroughs. The COVID-19 pandemic in New York City exacerbated the situation at East Broadway Mall, and the dim sum restaurant upstairs, which had operated for a long time, was closed. Elizabeth Center has done marginally better, and many tenants remained during the COVID-19 pandemic. By contrast, East Broadway Mall went from having around 80 stores to roughly 17 during the pandemic. Media sources reported in November 2021 that the New York state government was giving $20 million to revitalize several city-owned properties in the area. Some proposals have been made to convert the interiors of the East Broadway Mall into a community theater, with commercial stores outdoors. However, Curbed reported in October 2022 that the government grant was being rescinded from East Broadway Mall.

==Satellite Chinatowns==

For a long time, Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown has always been the most largely concentrated Chinese population in New York City, a city where 6% of the overall population is Chinese American. However, in recent years growing Chinese populations in the outer boroughs have tremendously outnumbered Manhattan&#x27;s Chinese population. Other New York City Chinese communities have been settled over the years, including that of Flushing in Queens, particularly along from Roosevelt Avenue to Main Street through Kissena Boulevard.

Another Chinese community is located in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, particularly along 8th Avenue from 40th to 65th Streets. New York City&#x27;s newer Chinatowns have recently sprung up in Elmhurst and Corona, Queens (which border each other and are part of the same Chinatown), on Avenue U in the Homecrest section of Brooklyn, as well as in Bensonhurst, also in Brooklyn. Outside of New York City proper, rapidly growing suburban Chinatowns are developing within the New York metropolitan area in nearby Edison, New Jersey and Nassau County, Long Island.

While the composition of these satellite Chinatowns are as varied as the original, the political factions in the original Manhattan Chinatown (Tongs, Republic of China loyalists, People&#x27;s Republic of China loyalists, and those apathetic) have led to some factionalization in the satellite Chinatowns.

=== Satellite Chinatowns&#x27; demographics ===

The Flushing Chinatown was spearheaded by many Chinese following the Handover of Hong Kong in 1997 as well as Taiwanese who used their considerable capital to buy out the land from the former residents. The Chinatowns of Flushing and Elmhurst are more middle class and were initially mainly small Taiwanese Mandarin-speaking enclaves, but have since grown very large and very diversified with Chinese migrants from many various regions from mainland China also often speaking Mandarin along with their regional dialects. Flushing is now the largest Chinatown of New York City and has taken over as being the main Chinese cultural center due to the very high diversity of Chinese immigrants from many various regions of mainland China and Taiwan.

There are three major Brooklyn Chinatowns. Unlike the Chinese enclaves in Queens, which has a very high diversity of Chinese immigrants from various regions of mainland China and Taiwan, the Brooklyn Chinatowns are very segregated into Cantonese dominated enclaves in Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay and the Fuzhou dominated enclave in Sunset Park, although with some significant limited population of long-time Cantonese residents. The Sunset Park Chinatown originally emerged as a small Cantonese enclave, but with the large influx of Fuzhou immigrants arriving into Sunset Park since the 2000s, it has grown into becoming the largest Fuzhou Chinatown of New York City, although some Cantonese people remain in the Sunset Park area. The Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay Chinatowns are primarily Cantonese populated as a result of many of them migrating away from both Chinatowns of Manhattan and Brooklyn Sunset Park including new Cantonese immigration. Bensonhurst Chinatown&#x27;s Chinese population is growing faster than that of Sunset Park. According to the 2010 census information, Bensonhurst and the nearby neighborhood of Bath Beach in Brooklyn together constituted New York City&#x27;s largest concentrated community of Hong Kong Residents (with 3,723 in Bensonhurst and 1,049 in Bath Beach totaling together at 4,772), even though they are very heavily mixed in with the area&#x27;s much larger Cantonese community consisting mostly of Cantonese speaking immigrants from Mainland China&#x27;s Guangdong Province, and although most of the Hong Kong residents are scattered across many other neighborhoods of New York City while only roughly about less than a quarter of New York City&#x27;s Hong Kong residents reside in Bensonhurst/Bath Beach.

NYC Dept. Of City Planning provided updated 2020 census data on the Asian population of New York City. Bensonhurst now has 46,000 Asian Residents while Sunset Park had 31,400 Asian Residents, which means Bensonhurst now has the highest Asian population of Brooklyn surpassing Sunset Park as the original epicenter of Brooklyn&#x27;s Asian population. The Asian population in Bensonhurst and Sunset Park are still overwhelmingly Chinese residents. Queens neighborhoods of Flushing (54,200 Asian Residents) and Elmhurst(55,800 Asian Residents) still hold the largest Asian populations in all of New York City though. Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown Asian population ranks at 27,200 residents.

==Buildings==
For much of Chinatown&#x27;s history, there were few unique architectural features to announce to visitors that they had arrived in the neighborhood (other than the language of the shop signs). In 1962, the Lieutenant Benjamin Ralph Kimlau Memorial archway at Chatham Square was erected in memorial of the Chinese-Americans who died in World War II, designed by local architect Poy Gum Lee (1900–1968). This memorial bears calligraphy by the great Yu Youren (1879–1964). A statue of Lin Zexu, also known as Commissioner Lin, a Foochowese Chinese official who opposed the opium trade, is also located at the square; it faces uptown along East Broadway, now home to the bustling Fuzhou neighborhood and known locally as Fuzhou Street.

More decorations and cultural institutions followed. In the 1970s, New York Telephone, then the local phone company, started capping the street phone booths with pagoda-like decorations. In 1976, the statue of Confucius in front of Confucius Plaza became a common meeting place. In the 1980s, banks that opened new branches and others that were renovating started to use Chinese traditional styles for their building facades. The Church of the Transfiguration, a national historic site built in 1815, stands off Mott Street. The Chinese American experience has been documented at the Museum of Chinese in America in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown since 1980. In addition, Pearl River Mart, which opened in 1971, has become one of the more notable family-owned stores in Chinatown.

In 2010, Chinatown and Little Italy were listed in a single historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Housing===
The housing stock of Chinatown is still mostly composed of cramped tenement buildings, some of which are over 100 years old. It is still common in such buildings to have bathrooms in the hallways, to be shared among multiple apartments. A federally subsidized housing project, named Confucius Plaza, was completed on the corner of Bowery and Division Street in 1976. This 44-story residential tower block gave much needed new housing stock to thousands of residents. The building also housed a new public grade school, PS 124 (or Yung Wing Elementary). Besides being the first and largest affordable housing complex specifically available to the Chinatown population Confucius Plaza is also a cultural and institutional landmark, springing forth community organization, Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE), one of Chinatown&#x27;s oldest political/community organizations, founded in 1974.

===Chinese theaters===
In the past, Chinatown had Chinese movie theaters that provided entertainment to the Chinese population. The first Chinese-language theater in the city was located at 5–7 Doyers Street from 1893 to 1911. The theater was later converted into a rescue mission for the homeless from Bowery. In 1903, the theater was the site of a fundraiser by the Chinese community for Jewish victims of a massacre in Kishinev.

Among the theaters that existed in Chinatown in later years were the Sun Sing Theater under the Manhattan Bridge and the Pagoda Theater, both on the street of East Broadway, the Governor Theater on Chatham Square, the Rosemary Theater on Canal Street across the Manhattan Bridge, as well as the Music Palace on the Bowery, which was the last Chinese theater to close. Others have existed in different sections of Chinatown. These theaters now have all closed because of more accessibility to videotapes, which were more affordable and provided more genres of movies and much later on DVDs and VCDs became available. Other factors such as, availability of Chinese cable channels, karaoke bars, and gambling in casinos began to provide other options for the Chinese to have entertainment also influenced the Chinese theaters to go out of business.

==Police and crime==
Chinatown is patrolled by the 5th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 19 Elizabeth Street. The 5th Precinct and the adjacent 7th Precinct ranked 58th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 42 per 100,000 people, Chinatown and the Lower East Side&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 449 per 100,000 people is higher than that of the city as a whole.

The 5th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories that have decreased by 77.1% between 1990 and 2019. The precinct reported 6 murders, 14 rapes, 91 robberies, 210 felony assaults, 101 burglaries, 585 grand larcenies, and 16 grand larcenies auto in 2019.

==Fire safety==

Chinatown is served by two New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire stations:
* Engine Company 9/Ladder Company 6 – 75 Canal Street
* Engine Company 55/Battalion 2 – 363 Broome Street

==Health==
, preterm births and births to teenage mothers are less common in Chinatown and the Lower East Side than in other places citywide. In Chinatown and the Lower East Side, there were 82 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 10.1 teenage births per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide). Chinatown and the Lower East Side have a low population of residents who are uninsured. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 11%, slightly less than the citywide rate of 12%.

The concentration of fine particulate matter, the deadliest type of air pollutant, in Chinatown and the Lower East Side is , more than the city average. Twenty percent of Chinatown and Lower East Side residents are smokers, which is more than the city average of 14% of residents being smokers. In Chinatown and the Lower East Side, 10% of residents are obese, 11% are diabetic, and 22% have high blood pressure—compared to the citywide averages of 24%, 11%, and 28% respectively. In addition, 16% of children are obese, compared to the citywide average of 20%.

Eighty-eight percent of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is about the same as the city&#x27;s average of 87%. In 2018, 70% of residents described their health as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;very good&quot;, or &quot;excellent&quot;, less than the city&#x27;s average of 78%. For every supermarket in Chinatown and the Lower East Side, there are 18 bodegas.

The nearest major hospital is NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital in the Civic Center area.

==Post offices and ZIP Codes==

Chinatown is located within two primary ZIP Codes. The area east of Bowery is part of 10002, while the area west of Bowery is part of 10013. The United States Postal Service operates two post offices in Chinatown:
* Chinatown Station – 6 Doyers Street
* Knickerbocker Station – 128 East Broadway

== Education ==
Chinatown and the Lower East Side generally have a higher rate of college-educated residents than the rest of the city . A plurality of residents age 25 and older (48%) have a college education or higher, while 24% have less than a high school education and 28% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 64% of Manhattan residents and 43% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Chinatown and the Lower East Side students excelling in math rose from 61% in 2000 to 80% in 2011 and reading achievement increased from 66% to 68% during the same period.

Chinatown and the Lower East Side&#x27;s rate of elementary school student absenteeism is lower than the rest of New York City. In Chinatown and the Lower East Side, 16% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, less than the citywide average of 20%. Additionally, 77% of high school students in Chinatown and the Lower East Side graduate on time, more than the citywide average of 75%.

===Schools===

Residents are zoned to schools in the New York City Department of Education. PS 124, The Yung Wing School is located in Chinatown. It was named after Yung Wing, the first Chinese person to study at Yale University. PS 130 Hernando De Soto is located in Chinatown. PS 184 Shuang Wen School, a bilingual Chinese-English School which opened in 1998, is a non-zoned school in proximity to Chinatown.

===Library===
The New York Public Library (NYPL) operates the Chatham Square branch at 33 East Broadway. The branch was founded in 1899; the current Carnegie library building opened in 1903 and was renovated in 2001. The four-story library contains a large Chinese collection, which has been housed at the library since 1911.

==Transportation==

There are two New York City Subway stations that are directly in the neighborhood—Grand Street () and Canal Street ()—although other stations are also nearby. New York City Bus routes include .

The Manhattan Bridge connects Chinatown to Downtown Brooklyn. The FDR Drive runs along the East River, where the East River Greenway, a pedestrian walkway and bikeway, is also present.

The major cultural streets are Mott Street and East Broadway; on the other hand, Canal Street, Allen Street, Delancey Street, Grand Street, East Broadway, and Bowery are the main traffic arteries.

There are multiple bike lanes in the area as well.

===Street names in Chinese===
Streets in Chinatown also have Chinese names, which are noted on bilingual street signs in Chinatown. Prior to the 1960s, Chinatown residents named the streets informally, and streets could carry several Chinese names. The first bilingual street signs installed by the city government were placed on police call boxes in 1966. The first 44 bilingual street signs, displaying the street name in English with a smaller street name in Chinese below, were installed in 1969. These signs were installed in an area bounded by Canal Street to the north, Bowery to the east, Chatham Square to the southeast, Worth Street to the south, and Mulberry Street to the west. The street names were selected to match phonetic transliterations of English names in Taishanese and Cantonese, the two Chinese varieties most frequently spoken in Chinatown at the time. As different Chinese varieties may have widely varying pronunciations for the same word, the signs did not account for pronunciations in Mandarin and Fujianese, the varieties spoken by many immigrants who came in the 1970s.

In the early 1980s, the program was expanded following an effort by urban planner Jerry S. Y. Cheng and Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA) president Li Boli. The New York City Department of Transportation commissioned a study in 1985 to identify places for new signs, but most records have been lost or destroyed. The expansion would have extended the signs north to Broome Street, east to Allen and Pike Streets, southeast to Madison Street (between Oliver and Pike Streets), and west to Lafayette Street. The newer street names were proposed by CCBA members and affiliated merchants, who mostly spoke Taishanese and Cantonese. Calligrapher Tan Bingzhong manually wrote the Chinese characters on street signs for 40 streets, leading to slight variations in each sign.

While there were 155 street signs at the program&#x27;s peak, only 101 signs remained , and almost half of the 40 streets no longer have bilingual signs. A &quot;New York Times&quot; analysis of the program found that many damaged signs were replaced with English-only signs, as translated street names are not part of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, or else were not replaced at all. Furthermore, many of the people involved in the street-sign programs during the 1960s and 1980s had died, and the relocation of the neighborhood&#x27;s Chinese residents had shrunken the area&#x27;s Chinese presence over time. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, there was little awareness in the neighborhood that the bilingual signs were disappearing, even among community leaders.

<text>Frank Oz (born Frank Richard Oznowicz; May 25, 1944) is an English-born American puppeteer, filmmaker, and actor. He is best known for his involvement with Jim Henson and George Lucas through &quot;The Muppets&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as well as his directorial work in feature films and theater.

The son of puppeteers, Oz worked as an apprentice puppeteer during his teenage years in Oakland, California. Despite his interest in journalism, he continued his career as a puppeteer when he was hired by The Jim Henson Company in 1963, going on to perform several television characters such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal, and Sam Eagle on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1976–1981) and Cookie Monster, Bert, and Grover on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (1969–2013). He was hired by Lucas to perform as Yoda in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series, beginning with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and reprising the role in seven subsequent films and various media for more than four decades.

Oz is also known for his work as a filmmaker, having directed the films &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982), &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984), &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986), &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (1988), &quot;What About Bob?&quot; (1991), &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; (1995), &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997), &quot;Bowfinger&quot; (1999), and &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2007), as well as an episode of &quot;Leverage&quot; (2011).

Oz was born Frank Richard Oznowicz in Hereford on May 25, 1944, the son of Belgian mother Frances (née Ghevaert; 1910–1989) and father Isadore &quot;Mike&quot; Oznowicz (1916–1998), both of whom were puppeteers who had moved to England when his father joined the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade. His mother was an ethnically Flemish Catholic, whilst his father was Jewish. Some of his parents&#x27; puppets, including one that was made to mock Adolf Hitler, survived World War II and were presented at the Contemporary Jewish Museum and the Dutch National Archives. His father later worked as a window trimmer.

The family left England when Oz was six months old, living in his mother&#x27;s native Belgium until he was five. They then moved to the U.S. and settled in Montana in 1951, before eventually relocating to Oakland, California. Oz attended Oakland Technical High School and Oakland City College. He worked as an apprentice puppeteer at Children&#x27;s Fairyland as a teenager with the Vagabond Puppets, a production of the Oakland Recreation Department, where Lettie Connell was his mentor.

==Career==

===Performing===
Oz performed as a puppeteer with Jim Henson’s Muppets. As a teenager, he worked with the Vagabond Puppets at the Children&#x27;s Fairyland of Oakland, which is how he first met Henson. He was 19 when he joined Henson in New York to work on the Muppets in 1963. His characters have included Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal, and Sam Eagle on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, and Cookie Monster, Bert and Grover on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

In addition to performing a variety of characters, Oz was one of the primary collaborators responsible for the development of the Muppets, known most notably for his chemistry with Jim Henson himself, performing in such pairings as: Ernie and Bert; Cookie Monster and Kermit the Frog; Kermit and Miss Piggy; Kermit and Fozzie Bear; Kermit and Grover; Ernie and Cookie Monster; Rowlf the Dog and Fozzie Bear; Rowlf and Miss Piggy, and The Swedish Chef (Henson performed the head and voice, with Oz normally operating the hands). Oz performed as a puppeteer in over 75 productions, including &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (as the Wiseman), video releases, and television specials, as well as countless other public appearances, episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and other Jim Henson series. His puppetry work spans from 1963 to the present, although he semi-retired from performing his Muppets characters in 2001 (continuing to perform on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; on a yearly basis through 2012). In 2001, his characters were taken over primarily by Eric Jacobson (with David Rudman as Cookie Monster).

Oz explained why he decided on leaving the Muppets in a 2007 interview:
Oz is well known as the performer of Jedi Master Yoda from George Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. Henson had originally been contacted by Lucas about performing Yoda. Henson was preoccupied, so he suggested Oz be assigned as the chief puppeteer of the character, as well as a creative consultant. Oz performed the puppet and provided the voice for Yoda in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), and &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017). Director Rian Johnson decided to return to using a puppet instead of using computer-generated imagery (CGI) in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), even using the original mold, because he felt CGI would not have worked as it was not true to the Yoda Luke knew in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). Oz also provided the voice of a CGI Yoda in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). The conversion to CGI was met with some criticism among fans, but Oz himself said that was &quot;exactly what [Lucas] should have done.&quot; Oz voiced Yoda in Disney theme park attractions, including &quot;Star Tours–The Adventures Continue&quot; and within &quot; Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge as well as in the &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; episodes &quot;Path of the Jedi&quot; and &quot;Shroud of Darkness&quot;.

Oz voiced Yoda in the 2020 Oculus Quest virtual reality game &quot;Tales from the Galaxy&#x27;s Edge&quot; alongside original C-3PO performer Anthony Daniels.

He directed the 2017 documentary &quot;Muppet Guys Talking: Secrets Behind the Show the Whole World Watched&quot; in which he and other Muppet performers discuss working behind the scenes with Jim Henson and the Muppets.

===Directing===
Inspiration as a filmmaker came to Oz upon a viewing of the Orson Welles film &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958), the director told Robert K. Elder in an interview for &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot;:


Oz began his behind-the-camera work when he co-directed the fantasy film &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; with long-time collaborator Jim Henson (Oz also puppeteered Aughra and the Skeksis Chamberlain in the film). The film featured the most advanced puppets ever created for a movie. Oz further employed those skills in directing 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, as well as sharing a screenwriting credit.

In 1986, he directed his first film that did not involve Henson, &quot;Little Shop Of Horrors&quot;. The musical film starred Rick Moranis and Ellen Greene, as well as Vincent Gardenia, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, John Candy, Christopher Guest, Jim Belushi and a 15-foot-tall talking plant (voiced by Levi Stubbs) which, at its ultimate size, required up to 60 puppeteers to operate. The film allowed Oz to show his ability to work with live actors and led to opportunities to direct films that did not include puppetry.

Usually helming comedic productions, Oz went on to direct &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; in 1988, starring Steve Martin and Michael Caine; &quot;What About Bob?&quot; in 1991, starring Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss; and &quot;Housesitter&quot; in 1992, starring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn (all of which were scored by Miles Goodman). Later films include &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; (1995), &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997), &quot;Bowfinger&quot; (1999), &quot;The Score&quot; (2001), the 2004 remake of &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, and the original &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2007).

Oz has frequently experienced on-set tension while directing his films, notably during the productions of &quot;What About Bob?&quot;, &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;, &quot;The Score&quot; and &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;.

In 2016, Oz directed a one-man stage show titled &quot;In &amp; Of Itself&quot; starring Derek DelGaudio, which had its world premiere at the Geffen Playhouse on May 16. In April 2017, with the financial backing by Neil Patrick Harris among others, the play began its Off-Broadway theatrical run, which was initially slated for 10 weeks, but ended up extending its run for 72 weeks. In October 2020, the streaming service Hulu purchased the rights to a live recording of the play, which debuted on January 22, 2021.

===Unrealized projects===
In the late 1980s, Oz was attached to direct a film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1922 short story &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; for Universal Pictures, with Martin Short slated to star. Oz dropped out of the project after he could not figure out how to make the story work.

Oz was also going to direct the 1990 film &quot;Mermaids&quot; after Lasse Hallström dropped out of the project. However, Oz also left the project due to creative differences and was ultimately replaced by Richard Benjamin. Oz reportedly did not get along with Cher, who starred in the film.

It was reported in 1992 that Oz was slated to direct a film adaptation of the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; for The Geffen Film Company. Oz also planned to direct an unmade film titled &quot;Swing Vote&quot; before directing &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;.

In the late 1990s, it was reported that Oz was going to direct either Sylvester Stallone or Bruce Willis in an unmade film titled &quot;Ump&quot; for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Oz claimed in a 2007 interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; that he turned down the offer to direct &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002). However, Oz later retracted his statement about turning down the project in a 2021 interview. &quot;No, they didn&#x27;t offer it to me. They asked me if I was interested. So it wasn&#x27;t really an offer.&quot;

In 2006, Dick Cook hired Oz to write and direct &quot;The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made&quot; for Walt Disney Pictures. However, Disney passed on the project in favor of Jason Segel&#x27;s script for what would become &quot;The Muppets&quot; following Cook&#x27;s departure from the studio.

===Acting===
As an actor, Oz appeared in one scene as a Corrections Officer in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), directed by John Landis. He appeared in a similar role and scene in &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), also directed by Landis. He had roles in several other Landis films including &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981), &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (1985), &quot;Innocent Blood&quot; (1992), and &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1998). In 2001, he had a voice acting role in the Pixar film &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; as Randall&#x27;s scare assistant, Fungus. In 2005, he had a minor part in the Columbia film &quot;Zathura&quot; as the voice of the robot. He played a lawyer in the critically acclaimed 2019 film &quot;Knives Out&quot;.

Oz played a surgeon in scenes cut from the theatrical release of &quot;Superman III&quot;. Other cameos include &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; and several other Jim Henson-related films that did not involve just his puppeteering.

When Oz does not appear in a Landis film, his name is often spoken in the background. During airport scenes in &quot;Into the Night&quot; and &quot;Coming to America&quot;, there are announcements on the PA system for &quot;Mr. Frank Oznowicz&quot;.

==Personal life==
Oz married Robin Garsen in 1979 and they divorced in 2005. He married Victoria Labalme, performing artist and daughter of historian Patricia Hochschild Labalme and designer George Labalme Jr., in 2011. He has four children. He maintained a residence in England for nine years, and lives in Manhattan as of 2012.

<text>Michael Andreas Helmuth Ende (12 November 1929 – 28 August 1995) was a German writer of fantasy and children&#x27;s fiction. He is known for his epic fantasy &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; (with its 1980s film adaptation and a 1995 animated television adaptation); other well-known works include &quot;Momo&quot; and &quot;Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver&quot;. His works have been translated into more than 40 languages and sold more than 35 million copies.

==Early life==
Ende was born 12 November 1929 in Garmisch, Bavaria, the only child of the surrealist painter Edgar Ende and Luise Bartholomä Ende, a physiotherapist. In 1935, when Michael was six, the Ende family moved to the &quot;artists&#x27; quarter of Schwabing&quot; in Munich (Haase). Growing up in this rich artistic and literary environment influenced Ende&#x27;s later writing.

In 1936, his father&#x27;s work was declared &quot;degenerate art&quot; and banned by the Nazi Party, so Edgar Ende was forced to draw and paint in secret. 

==Second World War==
World War II heavily influenced Ende&#x27;s childhood. He was twelve years old when he witnessed the first Allied bombing raid on Munich:
Our street was consumed by flames. The fire didn&#x27;t crackle; it roared. The flames were roaring. I remember singing and careering through the blaze like a drunkard. I was in the grip of a kind of euphoria. I still don&#x27;t truly understand it, but I was almost tempted to cast myself into the fire like a moth into the light. 

He was horrified, however, by the 1943 Hamburg bombing, which he experienced while visiting his paternal uncle. At the first available opportunity his uncle put him on a train back to Munich. There, Ende attended the Maximillians Gymnasium until schools were closed as the air raids intensified and pupils were evacuated. Ende returned to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where he was billeted in a boarding-house, Haus Kramerhof and later in Haus Roseneck. It was there that his interest in German poetry was awakened. As well as writing his own poetry, he began to study various literary movements and styles. As most recent German poetry was banned as part of censorship in Nazi Germany, he instead studied the German Romantic poet Novalis, whose &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot; made a great impression on him.

In 1944, Edgar Ende&#x27;s studio at no. 90 Kaulbachstraße, Munich went up in flames and over two hundred and fifty paintings and sketches were destroyed, as well as all his prints and etchings. , Director of Public Art for Bavaria, was still in possession of a number of Ende&#x27;s paintings, which survived the raids. After the bombing, Luise Ende was relocated to the Munich district of Solln. In 1945, Edgar Ende was taken as a prisoner of war by American GIs, but was released soon after the end of the war.

In 1945, German youths as young as fourteen were drafted into the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; and sent to war against the advancing Allied armies. Three of Michael Ende&#x27;s classmates were killed on their first day of combat. Ende was also drafted, but tore up his call-up papers and joined a secret German resistance group founded to sabotage the SS&#x27;s declared intention to defend Munich until the &quot;bitter end&quot;. Ende served the group as a courier for the remainder of the war.

In 1946, Michael Ende&#x27;s grammar school re-opened, and he attended classes for a year, following which the financial support of family friends allowed him to complete his high-school education at a Waldorf School in Stuttgart. This seemingly charitable gesture was motivated by more self-interest: Ende had fallen in love with a girl three years his senior, and her parents funded his two-year stay in Stuttgart to keep the pair apart. It was at this time that he first began to write stories (&quot;Michael,&quot; par. 3). He aspired to be a &quot;dramatist,&quot; but wrote mostly short stories and poetry (Haase).

==Career==

===Early career===
During his time in Stuttgart, Ende first encountered Expressionist and Dadaist writing and began schooling himself in literature. He studied Theodor Däubler, Yvan Goll, Else Lasker-Schüler and Alfred Mombert, but his real love was the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke, Stefan George and Georg Trakl. He also made his first attempts at acting, performing with friends in Stuttgart&#x27;s America House. He was involved in productions of Chekhov&#x27;s one-act comedy &quot;The Bear&quot;, in which he played the principal role, and in the German premiere of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus&quot;. Ende&#x27;s first play &quot;Denn die Stunde drängt (As Time is Running Out)&quot; dates to this period. It was dedicated to Hiroshima, and was never performed.

Ende decided that he wanted to be a playwright, but financial considerations ruled out a university degree, so in 1948 he auditioned for the Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts in Munich and was granted a two-year scholarship (Haase).
On leaving drama school, his first job as an actor took him to a provincial theatre company in Schleswig-Holstein. The troupe travelled from town to town by bus, usually performing on makeshift stages, surrounded by beer, smoke and the clatter of skittles from nearby bowling alleys. The acting was a disappointment, he usually had to play old men and malicious schemers, and had barely enough time to memorize his lines. Despite the frustrations and disappointments of his early acting career, Ende came to value his time in the provinces as a valuable learning experience that endowed him with a practical, down-to-earth approach to his work: &quot;It was a good experience, a healthy experience. Anyone interested in writing should be made to do that sort of thing. It doesn&#x27;t have to be restricted to acting. It could be any kind of practical activity like cabinet making—learning how to construct a cabinet in which the doors fit properly.&quot; In Ende&#x27;s view, practical training had the potential to be more useful than a literary degree.

Thanks to the numerous contacts of his girlfriend Ingeborg Hoffmann, Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, , head of (the &#x27;Little Fish&#x27; cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller&#x27;s work. &quot;There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.&quot; Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues. He also worked as a film critic during the 1950s.

===Commercial success: writing &quot;Jim Knopf&quot;===
In the late 1950s, Ende wrote his first novel &quot;Jim Button&quot;.

Michael Ende always said that ideas only came to him when the logic of the story required them. On some occasions he waited a long time for inspiration to arrive. At one point during the writing of &quot;Jim Button&quot; the plot reached a dead end. Jim and Luke were stuck among black rocks and their tank engine couldn&#x27;t go any further. Ende was at a loss to think of a way out of the adventure, but cutting the episode struck him as disingenuous. Three weeks later he was about to shelve the novel when suddenly he had an idea—the steam from the tank engine could freeze and cover the rocks in snow, thus saving his characters from their scrape. &quot;In my case, writing is primarily a question of patience,&quot; he once commented.

After nearly a year the five hundred pages of manuscript were complete. Over the next eighteen months he sent the manuscript to ten different publishers, but they all responded that it was &quot;Unsuitable for our list&quot; or &quot;Too long for children&quot;. In the end he began to lose hope and toyed with the idea of throwing away the script. He eventually tried it at a small family publishing-house, K. in Stuttgart. Michael Ende&#x27;s manuscript was accepted by company director Lotte Weitbrecht who liked the story. Her only stipulation was that the manuscript had to be published as two separate books.

The first of the &quot;Jim Button&quot; novels was published in 1960. About a year later, on the morning of the announcement that his novel, &quot;Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver&quot;, had won the German Prize for Children&#x27;s Fiction, Ende was being sued by his landlady for seven months&#x27; rent back payment. With the prize money of five thousand marks, Michael Ende&#x27;s financial situation improved substantially, and his writing career began in earnest. After the awards ceremony, he embarked on his first reading tour, and within a year, the first &quot;Jim Knopf&quot; book was also nominated for the Hans Christian Andersen Award and received the Berlin Literary Prize for Youth Fiction. The second &quot;Jim Knopf&quot; novel, &quot;Jim Button and the Wild Thirteen&quot;, was published in 1962. Both books were serialized on radio and TV, and the Augsburger Puppenkiste famously adapted the novels in a version filmed by Hesse&#x27;s broadcasting corporation. The print-runs sold out so rapidly that K. Thienemanns could barely keep up. Translations into numerous foreign languages soon followed.

===Writing style and themes===
Ende claimed, &quot;It is for this child in me, and in all of us, that I tell my stories&quot;, and that &quot;[my books are] for any child between 80 and 8 years&quot; (qtd. Senick 95, 97). He often expressed frustration over being perceived as a children&#x27;s writer exclusively, considering that his purpose was to speak of cultural problems and spiritual wisdom to people of all ages. Especially in Germany, Ende was accused by some critics of escapism. He wrote in 1985:

One may enter the literary parlor via just about any door, be it the prison door, the madhouse door, or the brothel door. There is but one door one may not enter it through, which is the nursery door. The critics will never forgive you such. The great Rudyard Kipling is one to have suffered this. I keep wondering to myself what this peculiar contempt towards anything related to childhood is all about.

Ende&#x27;s writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and fantasy. The reader is often invited to take a more interactive role in the story, and the worlds in his books often mirror our reality, using fantasy to bring light to the problems of an increasingly technological modern society. His writings were influenced by Rudolf Steiner and his anthroposophy. Ende was also known as a proponent of economic reform, and claimed to have had the concept of aging money, or demurrage, in mind when writing &quot;Momo&quot;. A theme of his work was the loss of fantasy and magic in the modern world.

===Japan===
Michael Ende had been fascinated by Japan since his childhood. He loved Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s Japanese legends and ghost stories, and in 1959 he wrote a play inspired by Hearn&#x27;s material. &quot;Die Päonienlaterne&quot; (The Peony Lantern) was written for radio, but never broadcast. Ende was primarily interested in Japan because of its radical otherness. The Japanese language and script were so different from Ende&#x27;s native German that it seemed they were grounded in a different kind of consciousness—an alternative way of seeing the world. He was particularly intrigued by the way in which everyday circumstances were shaped into intricate rituals, such as the tea ceremony. There was, he realized, a sharp contrast between the traditions of ancient Japan and its industry-oriented modern-day society.

Ende won a devoted following in Japan, and by 1993 over two million copies of &quot;Momo&quot; and &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; had been sold in Japan. 

In 1986 Michael Ende was invited to attend the annual congress of the JBBY (Japanese Committee for International Children&#x27;s Literature) in Tokyo. He gave a lecture on &quot;Eternal Child-likeness&quot;—the first detailed explanation of his artistic vision. 1989 marked the opening of the exhibition &quot;Michael and Edgar Ende&quot; in Tokyo. The exhibition was subsequently shown in Otsu, Miyazaki, Nagasaki, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuyama. At the invitation of &quot;Shimbun&quot;, a Japanese newspaper, Michael Ende attended the opening and spent two months touring Japan. It was his third trip accompanied by the Japanese-born Mariko Sato, whom he married in September 1989. The following year an archive devoted to Michael Ende was established at Kurohime Dowakan, a museum in the Japanese city of Shinano-machi. Ende donated letters and other personal items to the collection. On 23 October 1992 Michael Ende made his final trip to Japan. In the course of their three-week visit Michael Ende and Mariko Sato-Ende visited the Dowakan museum, joined Ende&#x27;s Japanese publishers, Iwanami, in celebrating the millionth sale of Momo, and travelled to Kanazawa and Hamamatsu and a number of other cities that were new to Ende.

==Personal life==
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1952, Michael Ende met the actress Ingeborg Hoffmann during a party with friends. According to Ende, he was standing at an ivy-covered counter serving as barman, when Hoffmann strode towards him, looking &quot;flame-haired, fiery and chic&quot;. She declaimed: &quot;Leaning up against the ivy-covered wall / Of this old terrace&quot;; &quot;Mörike&quot;, Ende said instantly, recognizing the quotation. Hoffmann, eight years his senior, made a big impression on Ende. She in turn was intrigued by his literary cultivation and artistic inclinations. They began a relationship that led to their marriage in 1964 in Rome, Italy, and ended with Ingeborg Hoffmann&#x27;s sudden and unexpected death in 1985 from a pulmonary embolism; she was 63 years old.

Hoffmann influenced Ende profoundly. In addition to assisting with getting his first major manuscript published, Hoffmann worked with him on his others, reading them and discussing them with him. Hoffman also influenced Ende&#x27;s life in other ways. She encouraged Ende to join the Humanist Union, an organization committed to furthering humanist values. Together they campaigned for human rights, protested against West German rearmament, and worked towards peace. Thanks to Ingeborg Hoffmann&#x27;s numerous contacts, Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, Therese Angeloff, head of &quot;Die kleinen Fische&quot; (the &#x27;Little Fish&#x27; cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller is being interviewed about current events, and replies with quotes from Schiller&#x27;s writings. &quot;There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.&quot; Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues.

For fourteen years, Ende and Hoffmann, who were both Italophiles, lived just outside Rome in Genzano, in a house they called Casa Liocorno (&quot;The Unicorn&quot;). It was there that Ende wrote most of the novel &quot;Momo&quot;. Following the death of his wife, Ende sold the home in Genzano and returned to Munich. 

He married a second time in 1989, to Japanese woman Mariko Sato, and they remained married until his death. He first met Mariko Sato in 1976. Sato had emigrated from Japan to West Germany in 1974 and was working at the time for the International Youth Library in Munich. After their first meeting at the Bologna Children&#x27;s Book Fair, Sato translated some of Ende&#x27;s books into Japanese and helped answer his questions about Japanese culture. From 1977 to 1980 Michael Ende and Mariko Sato worked together to produce a translation into German of ten fairy tales by Japanese writer Kenji Miyazawa. The German text was never published, but their working partnership turned into a friendship. Mariko Sato accompanied him on a number of trips to Japan. The first trip took place in 1977 and included visits to Tokyo and Kyoto. For the first time Ende was able to experience Kabuki and Noh theatre, and was greatly impressed by traditional Japanese drama. Michael Ende had no children.

==Death==
In June 1994, Ende was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Over the next few months, he underwent various treatments, but the disease progressed. He ultimately succumbed to the disease in Filderstadt, Germany, on 28 August 1995.

<doc id="100939" wikidata="Q5044113" url="?curid=100939" title="The Carnival of Champions">
<text>The Carnival of Champions, as Don King nicknamed it, was an important boxing event held in New Orleans&#x27;s Louisiana Superdome on December 3, 1982.

The event had caught the international attention of boxing fans worldwide, but particularly in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico, because the two main events that night featured two Puerto Ricans, one Mexican and one American.

In the undercard&#x27;s first of two co-main events, Wilfredo Gómez of Puerto Rico would defend his WBC world Jr Featherweight championship against WBC&#x27;s world Bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor of Mexico. In the second, Wilfred Benítez, also of Puerto Rico, would defend his WBC world Jr Middleweight championship against the former WBA Welterweight champion of the world Thomas Hearns, of Detroit, Michigan.

There was a lot of media hype surrounding the event, and HBO televised both. Gómez, Pintor, Hearns and HBO commentator Sugar Ray Leonard (who came in to substitute Benitez) were paraded around New Orleans a few days before the event, and many former and current world boxing champions and other celebrities attended the fights.

Before the event, there was no palpable animosity, at least between Gomez and Pintor, and they were friendly towards each other during a press conference a few days before the fights; this might have been due in part to Gomez&#x27;s 1981 defeat at the hands of Salvador Sanchez, Sanchez&#x27;s tragic death on August 12, 1982 in a car accident, Pintor&#x27;s fight with Johnny Owen after which Owen died as a consequence of the blows he took and Duk Koo Kim&#x27;s recent death after a bout with Ray Mancini.

In Puerto Rico in particular, the event had been eagerly awaited for, because it would be the first time the two &quot;Wilfredos&quot; would fight the same night and in the same ring, defending their world titles. Another &quot;Wilfredo&quot; who would later join Gómez and Benitez as three division world champions, Wilfredo Vazquez, had been announced as a participator in the undercard, but he had to pull out because of an injury days prior to the fight.

After an excellent undercard that included a win by Alberto Mercado, Pintor was the first of the four world champions to step into the ring that night, to challenge Gómez for Gómez&#x27;s world title. In a brutal slugfest, Gómez struck first, hitting Pintor with an uppercut in round one, and pinning Pintor against the ropes for a good portion of round three, including a nineteen punch combination that had Pintor almost falling. It wasn&#x27;t to be easy, however, and by the end of that third round, Pintor began to introduce his jab to Gómez&#x27;s face. Gómez&#x27;s eye began to puff almost immediately. Gómez showed his championship heart by roaring back to take the fourth despite the bothering hematoma forming over his eye. 

In the fifth, it was Pintor&#x27;s turn to come back and take a round, but Gómez pounded Pintor to the head in rounds six, seven and eight, the latter in which Pintor lost a point for punching low. Pintor was finding out that Gómez was as hard to beat as his 37–1–1 (37 knockouts) record said he was. Pintor, however, had the heart of a lion too, and in the ninth he punched Gómez with poison in his hands and bad intentions, taking that round and round ten. Then came round twelve, one of the fiercest rounds in the Jr Featherweight boxing&#x27;s history. Gómez and Pintor traded punches toe to toe fiercely during that round, and both men had to be carried by their cornermen back to their corners. However, Gómez&#x27;s eyes were both almost closed by now, and his fans started having flashbacks of his 1981 bout with world featherweight champion Salvador Sánchez. Gómez realized he needed a dramatic finish, and he hit Pintor with everything he had, and with Pintor tiring and on the catching end of most of that round&#x27;s punches, he figured out he had to try to outbox Gómez the rest of the way.

In round thirteen, Pintor attacked Gómez&#x27;s eyes from a distance with his jab. One of the least action packed rounds was still a very good round, and Pintor took it by outmaneuvering Gómez for the first time in the bout.

Gómez, imagining he could have been behind on the scorecards, came for the fourteenth in a roar, and started throwing punches from all angles. Pintor was tired and Gómez looked stronger, but Gómez&#x27;s eyes were almost completely closed by this time, and he could barely see Pintor. He was, as he described it later himself &quot;fighting on instinct only&quot;. Then, suddenly he caught Pintor with a right to the temple and Pintor fell on his knees, for the first knockdown of the fight. He bravely beat the count of referee Arthur Mercante, but Gómez didn&#x27;t waste his opportunity and chased his wounded prey with uppercuts and crosses, until a right cross caught Pintor on his chin and he fell to the floor on his back. Mercante didn&#x27;t bother to count this time: He stopped the fight immediately and Gómez had retained his world title in a dramatic fight.

According to KO Magazine, Gómez led on fight judge Harold Lederman&#x27;s card by 125–121, and on Dick Cole&#x27;s by 126–120, while Pintor led on Artie Aidala&#x27;s card by 124–121 at the time of the stoppage. KO Magazine&#x27;s staff writer had it for Gómez at 125–120. 

20 minutes after the first of the two co main events was over, it was Hearns&#x27; turn to step into the ring and challenge Benitez. The two engaged in one of the most intense staredowns in history. After touching gloves, Hearns began to use his longer jab, but the brave champion started to dig in. Hearns boxed from a distance in rounds one, two and three and Benitez kept applying pressure, and using his best method of fighting: Lying against the ropes. Whenever pinned there, Hearns would try to unleash a combination and Benitez would slip the punches coming at him and countering. Benitez&#x27;s championship heart was also a very huge one.

In the fifth, Hearns struck with a right to the head and Benitez&#x27;s gloves touched the canvas. Referee Octavio Meyran of Mexico counted, but Benitez came back and almost won the round after that. Hearns also dominated the sixth and the seventh, but in the ninth, a Benitez right hand graced Hearns&#x27; chin and Hearns fell on all fours. Hearns also got up, and won the tenth round. Rounds eleven and twelve were all Wilfredo, with the champion trying to close the gap between him and Hearns with masterful counter punching and ring intelligence. Hearns, however, knew he needed the next few rounds to secure another world title, and he boxed Benitez by using his jab. Benitez also imagined &quot;he&quot; was the one who needed a rally, and had in rounds thirteen and fourteen, two of his best rounds of the fight. In round fifteen, Hearns seemed to think he had the decision secured, and Benitez seemed to imagine he needed a knockout to win, so Hearns proceeded to use his jab for three more minutes and Benitez tried to avoid defeat by throwing quick combinations onto Hearns&#x27; face to see if he could find the punch that would finally lay down &quot;The Hitman&quot; for good. But it wasn&#x27;t to be, and the bell rang, putting an end to the second of two intense and historic boxing battles. 

When the decision was announced, it was a majority decision: two judges had voted for Hearns, (144–139 and 146–136, according to KO magazine) and one for a draw (142–142), making Hearns the WBC&#x27;s new world Jr Middleweight champion.

<text>A royal charter is a formal grant issued by a monarch under royal prerogative as letters patent. Historically, they have been used to promulgate public laws, the most famous example being the English Magna Carta (great charter) of 1215, but since the 14th century have only been used in place of private acts to grant a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as boroughs (with municipal charters), universities, and learned societies.

Charters should be distinguished from royal warrants of appointment, grants of arms, and other forms of letters patent, such as those granting an organisation the right to use the word &quot;royal&quot; in their name or granting city status, which do not have legislative effect. The British monarchy has issued over 1,000 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in effect.

The earliest charter recorded on the UK government&#x27;s list was granted to the University of Cambridge by Henry III of England in 1231, although older charters are known to have existed including to the Worshipful Company of Weavers in England in 1150 and to the town of Tain in Scotland in 1066. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEX), and the Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors, in 2014.

==Historical development==
Charters have been used in Europe since medieval times to grant rights and privileges to towns, boroughs, and cities. During the 14th and 15th centuries the concept of incorporation of a municipality by royal charter evolved. Royal charters were used in England to make the most formal grants of various rights, titles, etc. until the reign of Henry VIII, with letters patent being used for less solemn grants. After the eighth year of Henry VIII, all grants under the Great Seal were issued as letters patent.

Among the past and present groups formed by royal charter are the Company of Merchants of the Staple of England (13th century), the British East India Company (1600), the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (since merged into Standard Chartered), the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O), the British South Africa Company, and some of the former British colonies on the North American mainland, City livery companies, the Bank of England and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC; see BBC Charter).

===Corporations===
Between the 14th and 19th centuries, royal charters were used to create chartered companies – for-profit ventures with shareholders, used for exploration, trade, and colonisation. Early charters to such companies often granted trade monopolies, but this power was restricted to Parliament from the end of the 17th century. Until the 19th century, royal charters were the only means other than an act of parliament by which a company could be incorporated; in the UK, the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 opened up a route to incorporation by registration, since when incorporation by royal charter has been, according to the Privy Council, &quot;a special token of Royal favour or ... a mark of distinction&quot;.

The use of royal charters to incorporate organisations gave rise to the concept of the &quot;corporation by prescription&quot;. This enabled corporations that had existed from time immemorial to be recognised as incorporated via the legal fiction of a &quot;lost charter&quot;. Examples of corporations by prescription include Oxford and Cambridge universities.

===Universities and colleges===

According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, of the 81 universities established in pre-Reformation Europe, 13 were established &quot;ex consuetudine&quot; without any form of charter, 33 by Papal bull alone, 20 by both Papal bull and imperial or royal charter, and 15 by imperial or royal charter alone. Universities established solely by royal (as distinct from imperial) charter did not have the same international recognition – their degrees were only valid within that kingdom.

The first university to be founded by charter was the University of Naples in 1224, founded by an imperial charter of Frederick II. The first university founded by royal charter was the University of Coimbra in 1290, by King Denis of Portugal, which received papal confirmation the same year. Other early universities founded by royal charter include the University of Perpignan (1349; papal confirmation 1379) and the University of Huesca (1354; no confirmation), both by Peter IV of Aragon; the Jagiellonian University (1364; papal confirmation the same year) by Casimir III of Poland; the University of Vienna (1365; Papal confirmation the same year) by Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria; the University of Caen (1432; Papal confirmation 1437) by Henry VI of England; the University of Girona (1446; no confirmation) and the University of Barcelona (1450; papal confirmation the same year), both by Alfonso V of Aragon; the University of Valence (1452; papal confirmation 1459) by the Dauphin Louis (later Louis XI of France); and the University of Palma (1483; no confirmation) by Ferdinand II of Aragon.

====British Isles====

Both Oxford and Cambridge received royal charters during the 13th century. However, these charters were not concerned with academic matters or their status as universities but rather about the exclusive right of the universities to teach, the powers of the chancellors&#x27; courts to rule on disputes involving students, and fixing rents and interest rates.

The University of Cambridge was confirmed by a papal bull in 1317 or 1318, but despite repeated attempts, the University of Oxford never received such confirmation. The three pre-Reformation Scottish universities were all established by papal bulls: St Andrews in 1413; Glasgow in 1451; and King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen (which later became the University of Aberdeen) in 1494.

Following the Reformation, establishment of universities and colleges by royal charter became the norm. The University of Edinburgh was founded under the authority of a royal charter granted to the Edinburgh town council in 1582 by James VI as the &quot;town&#x27;s college&quot;. Trinity College Dublin was established by a royal charter of Elizabeth I (as Queen of Ireland) in 1593. Both of these charters were given in Latin.

The Edinburgh charter gave permission for the town council &quot;to build and to repair sufficient houses and places for the reception, habitation and teaching of professors of the schools of grammar, the humanities and languages, philosophy, theology, medicine and law, or whichever liberal arts which we declare detract in no way from the aforesaid mortification&quot; and granted them the right to appoint and remove professors. But, as concluded by Edinburgh&#x27;s principal, Sir Alexander Grant, in his tercentenary history of the university, &quot;Obviously this is no charter founding a university&quot;. Instead, he proposed, citing multiple pieces of evidence, that the surviving charter was original granted alongside a second charter founding the college, which was subsequently lost (possibly deliberately). This would also explain the source of Edinburgh&#x27;s degree awarding powers, which were used from the foundation of the college.

The royal charter of Trinity College Dublin, while being straightforward in incorporating the college, also named it as &quot;mother of a University&quot;, and rather than granting the college degree-awarding powers stated that &quot;the students on this College ... shall have liberty and power to obtain degrees of Bachelor, Master, and Doctor, at a suitable time, in all arts and faculties&quot;. Thus the University of Dublin was also brought into existence by this charter, as the body that awards the degrees earned by students at Trinity College.

Following this, no surviving universities were created in the British Isles until the 19th century. The 1820s saw two colleges receive royal charters: St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter in 1828 and King&#x27;s College London in 1829. Neither of these were granted degree-awarding powers or university status in their original charters. The 1830s saw an attempt by University College London to gain a charter as a university and the creation by Act of Parliament of Durham University, but without incorporating it or granting any specific powers. These led to debate about the powers of royal charters and what was implicit to a university.

The essence of the debate was firstly whether the power to award degrees was incidental to the creation of a university or needed to be explicitly granted and secondly whether a royal charter could, if the power to award degrees was incidental, limit that power – UCL wishing to be granted a royal charter as &quot;London University&quot; but excluding the power to award degrees in theology due to the secular nature of the institute. Sir Charles Wetherell, arguing against the grant of a royal charter to UCL before the Privy Council in 1835, argued for degree-awarding powers being an essential part of a university that could not be limited by charter. Sir William Hamilton, wrote a response to Wetherell in the Edinburgh Review, drawing in Durham University and arguing that the power of universities, including the power to award specific degrees, had always been explicitly granted historically, thus creating a university did not implicitly grant degree-awarding powers. Other historians, however, disagree with Hamilton on the point of whether implicit grants of privileges were made, particularly with regard to the &quot;ius ubique docendi&quot; – the important privilege of granting universally-recognised degrees that was the defining mark of the &quot;studium generale&quot;. Hastings Rashdall states that &quot;the special privilege of the &quot;jus ubique docendi&quot; ... was usually, but not quite invariably, conferred in express terms by the original foundation-bulls; and was apparently understood to be involved in the mere act of erection even in the rare cases where it is not expressly conceded&quot;. Similarly, Patrick Zutshi, Keeper of Manuscripts and University Archives in Cambridge University Library, writes that &quot;Cambridge never received from the papacy an explicit grant of the &quot;ius ubique docendi&quot;, but it is generally considered that the right is implied in the terms of John XXII&#x27;s letter of 1318 concerning Cambridge&#x27;s status as a studium generale.&quot;

UCL was incorporated by royal charter in 1836, but without university status or degree-awarding powers, which went instead to the University of London, created by royal charter with the explicit power to grant degrees in Arts, Law, and Medicine. Durham University was incorporated by royal charter in 1837 (explicitly not founding the university, which it describes as having been &quot;established under our Royal sanction, and the authority of our Parliament&quot;) but although this confirmed that it had &quot;all the property, rights, and privileges which ... are incident to a University established by our Royal Charter&quot; it contained no explicit grant of degree-awarding powers. This was considered sufficient for it to award &quot;degrees in all the faculties&quot;, but all future university royal charters explicitly stated that they were creating a university and explicitly granted degree-awarding power. Both London (1878) and Durham (1895) later received supplemental charters allowing the granting of degrees to women, which was considered to require explicit authorisation. After going through four charters and a number of supplemental charters, London was reconstituted by Act of Parliament in 1898.

The Queen&#x27;s Colleges in Ireland, at Belfast, Cork, and Galway, were established by royal charter in 1845, as colleges without degree awarding powers. The Queens University of Ireland received its royal charter in 1850, stating &quot;We do will, order, constitute, ordain and found an University ... and the same shall possess and exercise the full powers of granting all such Degrees as are granted by other Universities or Colleges in the faculties of Arts, Medicine and Law&quot;. This served as the degree awarding body for the Queen&#x27;s Colleges until it was replaced by the Royal University of Ireland.

The royal charter of the Victoria University in 1880 started explicitly that &quot;There shall be and is hereby constituted and founded a University&quot; and granted an explicit power of awarding degrees (except in medicine, added by supplemental charter in 1883).

From then until 1992, all universities in the United Kingdom were created by royal charter except for Newcastle University, which was separated from Durham via an Act of Parliament. Following the independence of the Republic of Ireland, new universities there have been created by Acts of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament). Since 1992, most new universities in the UK have been created by Orders of Council as secondary legislation under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, although granting degree-awarding powers and university status to colleges incorporated by royal charter is done via an amendment to their charter.

====United States====
Several of the colonial colleges that predate the American Revolution are described as having been established by royal charter. Except for The College of William &amp; Mary, which received its charter from King William III and Queen Mary II in 1693 following a mission to London by college representatives, these were either provincial charters granted by local governors (acting in the name of the king) or charters granted by legislative acts from local assemblies.

The first charters to be issued by a colonial governor on the consent of their council (rather than by an act of legislation) were those granted to Princeton University (as the College of New Jersey) in 1746 (from acting governor John Hamilton) and 1748 (from Governor Jonathan Belcher). There was concern as to whether a royal charter given by a governor in the King&#x27;s name was valid without royal approval. An attempt to resolve this in London in 1754 ended inconclusively when Henry Pelham, the prime minister, died. However, Princeton&#x27;s charter was never challenged in court prior to its ratification by the state legislature in 1780, following the US Declaration of Independence.

Columbia University received its royal charter (as King&#x27;s College) in 1754 from Lieutenant Governor James DeLancey of New York, who bypassed the assembly rather than risking it rejecting the charter. Rutgers University received its (as Queen&#x27;s College) in 1766 (and a second charter in 1770) from Governor William Franklin of New Jersey, and Dartmouth College received its in 1769 from Governor John Wentworth of New Hampshire. The case of &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;, heard before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1818, centred on the status of the college&#x27;s royal charter. The court found in 1819 that the charter was a contract under the Contract Clause of the US Constitution, meaning that it could not be impaired by state legislation, and that it had not been dissolved by the revolution.

The charter for the College of William and Mary specified it to be a &quot;place of universal study, or perpetual college, for divinity, philosophy, languages and other good arts and sciences&quot;, but made no mention of the right to award degrees. However, the Latin text of the charter uses &quot;studium generale&quot; – the technical term used in the Middle Ages for a university –where the English text has &quot;place of universal study&quot;; it has been argued that this granted William and Mary the rights and status of a university.

The Princeton charter, however, specified that the college could &quot;give and grant any such degree and degrees ... as are usually granted in either of our universities or any other college in our realm of Great Britain&quot;. Columbia&#x27;s charter used very similar language a few years later, as did Dartmouth&#x27;s charter. The charter of Rutger uses quite different words, specifying that it may &quot;confer all such honorary degrees as usually are granted and conferred in any of our colleges in any of our colonies in America&quot;.

Of the other colleges founded prior to the American Revolution, Harvard College was established in 1636 by Act of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and incorporated in 1650 by a charter from the same body, Yale University was established in 1701 by Act of the General Assembly of Connecticut, the University of Pennsylvania received a charter from the proprietors of the colony in 1753, Brown University was established in 1764 (as the College of Rhode Island) by an Act of the Governor and General Assembly of Rhode Island, and Hampden-Sydney College was established privately in 1775 but not incorporated until 1783.

====Canada====
Eight Canadian universities and colleges were founded or reconstituted under royal charters in the 19th century, prior to Confederation in 1867. Most Canadian universities originally established by royal charter were subsequently reincorporated by acts of the relevant parliaments.

The University of King&#x27;s College was founded in 1789 and received a royal charter in 1802, naming it, like Trinity College, Dublin, &quot;the Mother of an University&quot; and granting it the power to award degrees. The charter remains in force.
McGill University was established under the name of &quot;McGill College&quot; in 1821, by a provincial royal charter issued by Governor General of British North America the Earl of Dalhousie; the charter stating that the &quot;College shall be deemed and taken to be an University&quot; and should have the power to grant degrees. It was reconstituted by a royal charter issued in 1852 by Queen Victoria, which remains in force.

The University of New Brunswick was founded in 1785 as the Academy of Liberal Arts and Sciences and received a provincial charter as the College of New Brunswick in 1800. In the 1820s, it began giving university-level instruction and received a royal charter under the name &quot;King&#x27;s College&quot; as a &quot;College, with the style and privileges of an University&quot;, in 1827. The college was reconstituted as the University of New Brunswick by an act of the provincial parliament in 1859.

The University of Toronto was founded by royal charter in 1827, under the name of &quot;King&#x27;s College&quot;, as a &quot;College, with the style and privileges of an University&quot;, but did not open until 1843. The charter was subsequently revoked and the institution replaced by the University of Toronto in 1849, under provincial legislation. Victoria University, a college of the University of Toronto, opened in 1832 under the name of the &quot;Upper Canada Academy&quot;, giving &quot;pre-university&quot; classes, and received a royal charter in 1836. In 1841. a provincial act replaced the charter, reconstituted the academy as Victoria College, and granted it degree-awarding powers. Another college of the University of Toronto, Trinity College, was incorporated by an act of the legislature in 1851 and received a royal charter in 1852, stating that it, &quot;shall be a University and shall have and enjoy all such and the like privileges as are enjoyed by our Universities of our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;.
Queen&#x27;s University was established by royal charter in 1841. This remains in force as the university&#x27;s primary constitutional document and was last amended, through the Canadian federal parliament, in 2011.

 was founded by royal charter in 1852, which granted it degree awarding powers and started that it would, &quot;have, possess, and enjoy all such and the like privileges as are enjoyed by our Universities of our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. This was replaced by a new charter from the National Assembly of Quebec in 1971.

Bishop&#x27;s University was founded, as Bishop&#x27;s College, by an act of the Parliament of the Province of Canada in 1843 and received a royal charter in 1853, granting it the power to award degrees and stating that, &quot;said College shall be deemed and taken to be a University, and shall have and enjoy all such and the like privileges as are enjoyed by our Universities of our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;.

The University of Ottawa was established in 1848 as the College of Bytown. It received a royal charter under the name &quot;College of Ottawa&quot;, raising it to university status in 1866.

====Australia====
The older Australian universities of Sydney (1850) and Melbourne (1853) were founded by acts of the legislatures of the colonies. This gave rise to doubts about whether their degrees would be recognised outside of those colonies, leading to them seeking royal charters from London, which would grant legitimacy across the British Empire.

The University of Sydney obtained a royal charter in 1858. This stated that (emphasis in the original):

The charter went on to (emphasis in the original):

The University of Melbourne&#x27;s charter, issued the following year, similarly granted its degrees equivalence with those from British universities.

The act that established the University of Adelaide in 1874 included women undergraduates, causing a delay in the granting of its charter as the authorities in London did not wish to allow this. A further petition for the power to award degrees to women was rejected in 1878 – the same year that London was granted that authority. A charter was finally granted – admitting women to degrees – in 1881.

The last of Australia&#x27;s 19th century universities, the University of Tasmania, was established in 1890 and obtained a royal charter in 1915.

===Guilds, learned societies, and professional bodies===

Guilds and livery companies are among the earliest organisations recorded as receiving royal charters. The Privy Council list has the Saddlers Company in 1272 as the earliest, followed by the Merchant Taylors Company in 1326 and the Skinners Company in 1327. The earliest charter to the Saddlers Company gave them authority over the saddlers trade; it was not until 1395 that they received a charter of incorporation. The Merchant Taylors were similarly incorporated by a subsequent charter in 1408.

Royal charters gave the first regulation of medicine in Great Britain and Ireland. The Barbers Company of London in 1462, received the earliest recorded charters concerning medicine or surgery, charging them with the superintendence, scrutiny, correction, and governance of surgery. A further charter in 1540 to the London Guild – renamed the Company of Barber-Surgeons – specified separate classes of surgeons, barber-surgeons, and barbers. The London Company of Surgeons separated from the barbers in 1745, eventually leading to the establishment of the Royal College of Surgeons by royal charter in 1800. The Royal College of Physicians of London was established by royal charter in 1518 and charged with regulating the practice of medicine in the City of London and within seven miles of the City.

The Barbers Guild (the &quot;Gild of St Mary Magdalen&quot;) in Dublin is said to have received a charter in 1446, although this was not recorded in the rolls of chancery and was lost in the 18th century. A later charter united the barbers with the (previously unincorporated) surgeons in 1577. The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland was established by royal charter in 1667 and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, which evolved from the Barbers&#x27; Guild in Dublin, in 1784.

The Royal Society was established in 1660 as Britain&#x27;s first learned society and received its first royal charter in 1662. It was reincorporated by a second royal charter in 1663, which was then amended by a third royal charter in 1669. These were all in Latin, but a supplemental charter in 2012 gave an English translation to take precedence over the Latin text. The Royal Society of Edinburgh was established by royal charter in 1783 and the Royal Irish Academy was established in 1785 and received its royal charter in 1786.

New professional bodies were formed in Britain in the early 19th century representing new professions that arose after the industrial revolution and the rise of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism. These new bodies sought recognition by gaining royal charters, laying out their constitutions and defining the profession in question, often based on occupational activity or particular expertise. To their various corporate objectives, these bodies added the concept of working in the public interest that was not found in earlier professional bodies. This established a pattern for British professional bodies, and the &#x27;public interest&#x27; has become a key test for a body seeking a royal charter.

==Australia==

Royal charters have been used in Australia to incorporate non-profit organisations. However, since at least 2004 this has not been a recommended mechanism.

==Belgium==
The royal decree is the equivalent in Belgium of a royal charter. In the period before 1958, 32 higher education institutes had been created by royal charter. These were typically engineering or technical institutions rather than universities.

However, several non-technical higher education institutions have been founded, or refounded, under royal decree, such as the &quot;Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique&quot; (National Fund for Scientific Research) in 1928 and the &quot;Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten&quot; in 1938.

Since the Belgian state reform of 1988–1989, competency over education was transferred to the federated entities of Belgium. Royal decrees can therefore no longer grant higher education institution status or university status.

==Canada==

In Canada, there are a number of organisations that have received royal charters. However, the term is often applied incorrectly to organisations, such as the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, that have been granted the use of a royal title rather than a royal charter.

===Companies and societies===
Companies, corporations, and societies in Canada founded under or augmented by a royal charter include:
* The Canada Company, incorporated by Act of Parliament in June 1825. A royal charter was issued in August 1826 to purchase and develop lands. Purchased the Crown Reserve of 1,384,413 acres and a special grant of 1,100,000 acres in the Huron County area.
* The Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, founded in 1824 as the first learned society in Canada, received its royal charter in 1831.
* The Royal Society of Canada, founded by Act of Parliament and granted a royal charter in 1883.
* The Royal Life Saving Society of Canada, founded 1891 and received royal patronage and style 1904. A royal charter was granted in 1924 by King George V.

British royal chartered corporations operating in Canada:
* The East India Company; granted a royal charter in 1600 by Queen Elizabeth I (tea sales in North America)
* The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company; founded by a royal charter issued in 1670 by King Charles II (administration of parts of current Quebec, Northern Ontario, and North West Territories, including Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, and judicial connections with Upper Canada)
* The Bank of British North America capital raised in Britain, founded by royal charter issued in 1836 (amalgamated with Bank of Montreal 1918).
* The Royal Commonwealth Society; founded by a royal charter issued in 1882 by Queen Victoria
* The Royal Academy of Dance; founded in 1920 as the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing; reconstituted by a royal charter issued in 1936 by King George V
* The Boy Scouts Association founded in 1910; incorporated by royal charter in 1912; Canadian General Council, now called Scouts Canada, formed in 1914 and incorporated by Act of the Canadian Parliament in 1914.

===Territories and communities===
Cities under royal charter are not subject to municipal Acts of Parliament applied generally to other municipalities, and instead are governed by legislation applicable to each city individually. The royal charter codifies the laws applied to the particular city and lays out the powers and responsibilities not given to other municipalities in the province concerned.
* St. John&#x27;s; claimed as England&#x27;s first oversea colony by royal charter issued in 1583 by Queen Elizabeth I
* Nova Scotia; founded by a royal charter issued in 1621 by King James I
* Saint John; founded by a royal charter issued in 1785 by King George III
* Vancouver
* Winnipeg
* Montreal

==India==
The Institution of Engineers was incorporated by royal charter in 1935.

==Ireland==
A number of Irish institutions were established by or received royal charters prior to Irish independence. These are no longer under the jurisdiction of the British Privy Council and their charters can thus only be altered by a Charter or Act of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament).

==South Africa==
The University of South Africa received a royal charter in 1877. The Royal Society of South Africa received a royal charter in 1908.

==United Kingdom==
Royal charters continue to be used in the United Kingdom to incorporate charities and professional bodies, to raise districts to borough status, and to grant university status and degree awarding powers to colleges previously incorporated by royal charter.

Most new grants of royal charters are reserved for eminent professional bodies, learned societies, or charities &quot;which can demonstrate pre-eminence, stability and permanence in their particular field&quot;. The body in question has to demonstrate not just pre-eminence and financial stability but also that bringing it under public regulation in this manner is in the public interest. In 2016, the decision to grant a royal charter to the (British) Association for Project Management (APM) was challenged in the court by the (American) Project Management Institute (PMI), who feared it would give a competitive advantage to APM and claimed the criteria had not been correctly applied; the courts ruled that while the possibility of suffering a competitive disadvantage did give PMI standing to challenge the decision, the Privy Council was permitted to take the public interest (in having a chartered body promoting the profession of project management) into account as outweighing any failure to meet the criteria in full. A list of UK chartered professional associations is at .

Individual chartered designations, such as chartered accountant or chartered engineer, are granted by some chartered professional bodies to individual members that meet certain criteria. The Privy Council&#x27;s policy is that all chartered designations should be broadly similar, and most require Master&#x27;s level qualifications (or similar experience).

In January 2007, the UK Trade Marks Registry refused to grant protection to the American Chartered Financial Analyst trademark, as the word &quot;chartered&quot; in the UK is associated with royal charters, thus its use would be misleading. &quot;Charter&quot; and &quot;chartered&quot; continue to be &quot;sensitive words&quot; in company names, requiring evidence of a royal charter or (for &quot;chartered&quot;) permission from a professional body operating under royal charter. The use of &quot;chartered&quot; in a collective trade mark similarly requires the association applying for the mark to have a royal charter as otherwise &quot;the mark would mislead the public into believing that the association and its members have chartered status&quot;.

Unlike other royal charters, a charter to raise a district to borough status is issued using statutory powers under the Local Government Act 1972 rather than by the royal prerogative.

The company registration number of a corporation with a royal charter is prefixed by &quot;RC&quot; for companies registered in England and Wales, &quot;SR&quot; for companies registered in Scotland, and &quot;NR&quot; for companies registered in Northern Ireland. However, many chartered corporations from outside England have an RC prefix from when this was used universally.

The BBC operates under a royal charter which lasts for a period of ten years, after which it is renewed.

==United States==
Royal charters have not been issued in the US since independence. Those that existed prior to that have the same force as other charters of incorporation issued by state or colonial legislatures. Following &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;, they are &quot;in the nature of a contract between the state, the corporation representing the founder, and the objects of the charity&quot;. Case law indicates that they cannot be changed by legislative action in a way that impairs the original intent of the founder, even if the corporation consents.

<doc id="100954" wikidata="Q1202670" url="?curid=100954" title="Saitō Dōsan">
<text>, also known as Saitō Toshimasa (斎藤 利政), was a Japanese samurai lord and daimyo during the Sengoku period. He was also known as the for his ruthless tactics. He was appointed Governor of Yamashiro by the Imperial Court. After entering monkhood in his later years, he was also called &quot;Saitō Yamashiro-nyudō-no-kami&quot; (斎藤山城入道守).

==Biography==
Saitō Dōsan has long been regarded as a symbolic figure of &quot;Gekokujō&quot; (the rise of those of lower status to positions of power), rising from a humble oil merchant to the ruler of Mino Province. However, recent research suggests that it was actually Dōsan&#x27;s father who was the oil merchant. This implies that Dōsan&#x27;s &quot;Gekokujō&quot; was a two-generation achievement involving both father and son.

He became a daimyo through &quot;Gekokujō&quot; of Toki Yorinari at Mino Province in 1542. Yorinari was forced out of Mino by Saitō Dōsan.

The Saito fortress was located at Inabayama castle. He married Omi no kata, a sister of Akechi Mitsutsuna (Akechi Mitsuhide&#x27;s father).

He defeated Oda Nobuhide at the Battle of Kanōguchi in 1547.

However, in 1549, eventually Oda Nobuhide was defeated by Dōsan, Nobuhide made peace with Dōsan by arranging a political marriage between his son and heir, Oda Nobunaga, and Dōsan&#x27;s daughter, Nōhime. Dōsan, therefore, became the father-in-law of Oda Nobunaga. 
Dōsan supported the marriage which allowed Nobuhide to focus on facing Imagawa Yoshimoto.

Several years later, rumors had started to circulate that Dōsan&#x27;s firstborn son, Saitō Yoshitatsu, was not his natural son and Dōsan started to consider another son, Saitō Kiheiji, or even his son-in-law Oda Nobunaga, as his heirs. This caused Yoshitatsu to rebel and kill his two younger brothers. In 1556, the forces of Dōsan and Yoshitatsu clashed in the Battle of Nagara-gawa which resulted in
the death of Dōsan.

Dōsan&#x27;s head was taken by a man called Komaki Genta, a retainer of Yoshitatsu&#x27;s son Saitō Tatsuoki. His remains were originally interred in Sōfuku-ji, but they were later moved to Jōzai-ji because the Nagara River kept overflowing and covering his burial mound. Both temples are located in the city of Gifu which celebrates Dōsan with an annual festival.

==Pseudonyms==
Saitō Dōsan is known for having a large number of pseudonyms and for frequently changing his name. Some believe that this is because there were two Saitō Dōsan, father and son, and the son adopted his father&#x27;s name after his death. Other names of Saitō Dōsan are Minemaru (峰丸), Hōrenbō (法蓮坊), Matsunami Shogorō (松浪庄五郎), Nishimura Kankurō Masatoshi (西村勘九郎正利), Shinkurō (新九郎), Nagai Norihide (長井規秀), and Saitō Sakondayu Toshimasa (斎藤左近大夫利政).
The name Saitō was adopted from the former shugodai of Mino who had been overcome by the Nagai clan in the 1520s.

Reiner was also the creator of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, which ran from 1961 to 1966 and which Reiner also produced, frequently scripted, and acted in.

Reiner formed a comedy duo with Brooks in &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man&quot; and acted in such films as &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot; (1966), and the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; film series (2001–2007). Reiner directed such comedies as &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1966), &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; (1970), and &quot;Oh, God!&quot; (1977). Reiner had a successful collaboration with Steve Martin, directing some of his most successful films, including &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979), &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; (1982), &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; (1983), and &quot;All of Me&quot; (1984).

Reiner wrote more than two dozen books, mostly in his later years. He is the father of actor-director Rob Reiner, author Annie Reiner, and artist Lucas Reiner, and the grandfather of Tracy Reiner.

==Early life==
Reiner was born in The Bronx, New York, on March 20, 1922, to Irving and Bessie Reiner (&quot;née&quot; Mathias). He was Jewish. His father was a watchmaker from Austria, and his mother was from Romania. He had an older brother, Charles, who served in the 9th Division in World War II; his ashes are buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

When Reiner was 16, working as a machinist repairing sewing machines, Charles read about a free drama workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration and told him about it. Carl later credited Charles with his decision to change careers. His uncle Harry Mathias was the first entertainer in his family.

===Military service===
Reiner was drafted into the United States Army Air Forces on October 27, 1942, and served during World War II, eventually achieving the rank of corporal by the end of the war. He initially trained to be a radio operator. After spending three months in the hospital recovering from pneumonia, he was sent to Georgetown University for ten months of training as a French interpreter. There, he had his first experience as a director, putting on a Molière play entirely in French. After completing language training in 1944, he was sent to Hawaii to work as a teleprinter operator. The night before he was scheduled to ship out for an unknown assignment, he attended a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; by the Special Services entertainment unit. Following an audition before actor Major Maurice Evans and Captain Allen Ludden, he was transferred to Special Services. Over the following two years, Reiner performed around the Pacific theater, entertaining troops in Hawaii, Guam, Saipan, Tinian, and Iwo Jima until he was honorably discharged in 1946.

==Career==
===1950–1959: Collaborations with Sid Caesar ===
Reiner performed in several Broadway musicals (including &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot; and &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;) and had the lead role in &quot;Call Me Mister&quot;. In 1950, he was cast by Max Leibman as a comic actor on Sid Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, appearing on air in skits while also contributing ideas to such writers as Mel Brooks and Neil Simon. He did not receive credit for his sketch material, but won Emmy Awards in 1955 and 1956 as a supporting actor. Reiner also wrote for &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; with Brooks, Simon, Woody Allen, Larry Gelbart, Mel Tolkin, Mike Stewart, Aaron Ruben, Sheldon Keller, and Gary Belkin. He assumed the role of head writer and semi-regular on &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; during the 1959–60 television season.

In November 1958, Reiner hosted a CBS prime time game show called &quot;Keep Talking&quot;, when he succeeded original host Monty Hall. He left the show in July 1959 and was succeeded by Vincent Price.

===1960–1969: &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and acclaim ===

Starting in 1960, Reiner teamed with Brooks as a comedy duo on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. Their performances on television and stage included Reiner playing the straight man in &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man&quot;. Eventually the routine expanded into a series of five comedy albums and a 1975 animated television special, with the last album in the series winning a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Comedy Album. The act gave Brooks &quot;an identity as a comic performer for the first time&quot;, said Reiner. Brooks&#x27;s biographer William Holtzman called their 12-minute act &quot;an ingenious jazz improvisation...&quot; while Gerald Nachman described Reiner&#x27;s part in guiding the act:

In 1958, he wrote the initial 13 episodes of a television series titled &quot;Head of the Family&quot;, based on his own personal and professional life. However, the network disliked Reiner in the lead role for unknown reasons. In 1961, the series was recast and re-titled &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and became a popular series, making stars of his lead actors Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore. In addition to writing many of the episodes, Reiner occasionally appeared as show host Alan Brady. The series ran from 1961 to 1966 and thereafter entered a long run of syndication. In 1966, Reiner co-starred in &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot;.

From April 5, 1964, to September 9, 1965, Reiner hosted &quot;The Celebrity Game&quot;, a CBS prime time game show that was a precursor to the long-running &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. His first film directorial effort was an adaptation of Joseph Stein&#x27;s play &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1967), which, in turn, was based on his semi-autobiographical 1958 novel of the same name. 

===1970–1989: Transition to directing ===

Balancing directing, producing, writing, and acting, he worked on a wide range of films and television programs. Films from his early directing career include &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; (1970), &quot;Oh, God!&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979). In &quot;My Anecdotal Life: A Memoir&quot; (2003), he wrote, &quot;Of all the films I have directed, only &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; is universally acknowledged as a cult classic. A cult classic, as you may know, is a film that was seen by a small minority of the world&#x27;s film goers, who insist it is one of the greatest, most daring, and innovative moving pictures ever made. Whenever two or more cult members meet, they will quote dialogue from the classic and agree that &quot;the film was ahead of its time&quot;. To be designated a genuine cult classic, it is of primary importance that the film fail to earn back the cost of making, marketing, and distributing it. &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; was made in 1969 for a little over $1 million. According to the last distribution statements I saw, it will not break even until it earns another $650,000.&quot;

In 1977, Reiner directed and appeared in &quot;Oh, God!&quot; starring George Burns, John Denver, and Teri Garr. The film was a financial success making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 1977. The film was also a critical success with Roger Ebert giving the film a positive review writing, &quot;Carl Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Oh, God!&quot; is a treasure of a movie: A sly, civilized, quietly funny speculation on what might happen if God endeavored to present himself in the flesh yet once again to forgetful Man.&quot;

His follow up film &quot;The One and Only&quot; (1978) was not as successful, receiving a mixed reception from film critics. The film starred Henry Winkler, Kim Darby, and Gene Saks. Throughout the 1970s, Reiner made appearances on multiple television shows, including &quot;Night Gallery&quot; in the segment &quot;Professor Peabody&#x27;s Last Lecture&quot; in 1971, and as various characters in the variety sketch show &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1974). Reiner also returned to writing television by creating &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1971–1974), which ran for three seasons and starred Dick Van Dyke.

Reiner played a large role in the early career of Steve Martin by directing his first film &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979) and directing and co-writing with the comedian in &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; (1982), &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; (1983), and &quot;All of Me&quot; (1984). Reiner also appeared in both &quot;The Jerk&quot;, playing a version of himself, and &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot;. In 1989, he directed &quot;Bert Rigby, You&#x27;re a Fool&quot;.

===1990–2020: Voice work and final roles ===

In 2000, Reiner was honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center, where he was honored by fellow friends and comedians Mel Brooks, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Steve Martin, Rob Reiner, Jerry Seinfeld, Ray Romano, and Joy Behar. A year later, he portrayed Saul Bloom in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s remake of 1960&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;) and reprised his role in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007). From 2004 to 2005, Reiner voiced Sarmoti in &quot;Father of the Pride&quot;. He claimed he knew how to play the role; in a teleconference, he said, &quot;I spent my youth, from the time I was 6 to 18, living next to the Bronx Zoo. I knew the lions intimately. I watched them pace. They talked to me and I talked back to them. I learned that they have the worst breath of any animal in the world. I got my roar from the lions in person.&quot; He continued, &quot;The writing on this show is extraordinarily good. It&#x27;s a pleasure to come to work because you know you&#x27;re going to say something funny.&quot; Of his character of Sarmoti, Reiner stated that &quot;curmudgeons always get the good lines&quot;.

From 1967 to 2000, Reiner appeared in dozens of television specials. He also guest starred in several television series from the 1950s until his death in 2020. In May 2009, he guest starred as a clinic patient in &quot;Both Sides Now,&quot; the season five finale of &quot;House&quot;. He also voiced Santa in &quot;Merry Madagascar&quot; (2009) and reprised his role in the 2010 &quot;Penguins of Madagascar&quot; episode &quot;The All Nighter Before Christmas&quot;. In season 7 (December 2009) of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, he guest-starred as television producer Marty Pepper. In 2010, he guest starred in three of the first-season episodes of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; as Elka Ostrovsky&#x27;s (Betty White) date and reprised his role in February 2011. He also made appearances in &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; as Murray and wrote the story for the episode &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, named after the program that started his career. Reiner reprised his role on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; in seasons 8 (October 2013) and 11 (January 2014).
Reiner lent his voice to numerous films and animated films. He narrated the Bernard Rogers children&#x27;s piece “The Musicians of Bremen” on a Delos compact disc release. He also read for books on tape, among them &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; and &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (Running Press, 1994), as well as Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, and &quot;Letters from the Earth&quot; (New Millenium, 2001).

In 2012, he appeared as a guest on Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s series &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;. They talked at a diner about his comedy career and Reiner invited Seinfeld to come and have dinner with Mel Brooks and himself. Reiner reported that every night, Brooks headed to his house to eat, watch &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; (he taped it), and watch movies. He went on to offer the one rule for movies was that it had to be one where &quot;somebody says, &#x27;Secure the perimeter!&#x27; or &#x27;Get some rest.&#x27;&quot; Reiner stated that Brooks &quot;falls asleep with his mouth open&quot; every time.

Reiner&#x27;s final role was in &quot;Home Movie: The Princess Bride&quot;, a project that Jason Reitman had envisioned to engage his celebrity friends to help raise money for charity during the COVID-19 pandemic, with actors filming their own takes on scenes from &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; at their own homes. Reiner appeared along with Rob Reiner (who directed the original film) in the final scene as the Grandfather and Grandson, which Rob said had been shot three days before Reiner&#x27;s death. His final line on camera is, &quot;As you wish,&quot; which in the film it is based on means, &quot;I love you.&quot; After hearing of his death, Reitman asked the Reiner family if they should swap out the scene, but the family gave him their blessing to use the scene.

== Author and novelist ==
Reiner was the author of more than two dozen books. His first autobiographical novel &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1958) led to a 1995 sequel &quot;Continue Laughing&quot;. He published a memoir &quot;My Anecdotal Life: A Memoir&quot; in 2003. He also wrote a humorous series of memoirs under the titles &quot;I Remember Me&quot; (2012), &quot;I Just Remembered&quot; (2014), and &quot;What I Forgot to Remember&quot; (2015), along with books about film and art. He began to write children&#x27;s books based on the stories he used to tell a certain grandson who would request, &quot;Tell me a scary story, Grandpa, but not too scary.&quot;

==Comedy style==
Reiner expressed his philosophy on writing comedy in an interview in the December 1981 issue of &quot;American Film&quot;:

You have to imagine yourself as not somebody very special, but somebody very ordinary. If you imagine yourself as somebody really normal and if it makes you laugh, it&#x27;s going to make everybody laugh. If you think of yourself as something very special, you&#x27;ll end up a pedant and a bore. If you start thinking about what&#x27;s funny, you won&#x27;t be funny, actually. It&#x27;s like walking. How do you walk? If you start thinking about it, you&#x27;ll trip.

==Personal life==

=== Marriage and family ===
On December 24, 1943, Reiner married singer Estelle Lebost. They were married for almost 65 years until her death in October 2008. Estelle delivered the iconic line &quot;I&#x27;ll have what she&#x27;s having&quot; in the deli scene of the 1989 film &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;. They were the parents of actor and director Rob Reiner, poet, playwright, and author Annie Reiner, and painter, actor, and director Lucas Reiner. Reiner described himself as an atheist. He said, &quot;I have a very different take on who God is. Man invented God because he needed him. God is us.&quot; In 2013, he said he developed an atheistic viewpoint as the Holocaust progressed, stating it would not have continued if God existed. Reiner was a Democrat. His residence was in Beverly Hills, California.
=== Charity and interests ===
From 1974 to 2001, he sponsored the Carl Reiner Charity Celebrity Tennis Tournament in La Costa, California, directed by international tennis player Mike Franks, which was played yearly over 3 days and included 400 players, of which 100 were professionals. 

In July 2012, Reiner joined Twitter, tweeting that he was doing so to keep up with his grandson Jake. He felt obliged to post at least once per day, and so posted 6,520 tweets and accumulated 367,000 followers. His favorite topics were movies and Donald Trump, but his final tweet was a reminiscence about Noël Coward performing in Las Vegas. At the age of 98, Reiner was the oldest celebrity to actively use Twitter. 

His final interview was a webisode of &quot;Dispatches From Quarantine&quot;, which was posted on YouTube by the Jewish arts organization Reboot and Temple Beth Am. In this, he reminisced about his wife and family, &quot;We met, fell in love, and I was 20 at the time and she was 28, and people said this is not a match ... It only worked for 65 years, and if she didn&#x27;t pass on we&#x27;d still be working on it.&quot;

=== Political views ===
On October 31, 2018, Reiner, then 96 and a half, publicly denounced Donald Trump&#x27;s administration and stated his goal to live past November 3, 2020, and see Trump voted out of office.

=== Death ===
On June 29, 2020, Reiner died from natural causes at his home in Beverly Hills, California at the age of 98. According to his nephew George Shapiro, Reiner had been in good spirits all day, and had spent the evening watching television with Mel Brooks; afterward, at around 10:00 pm, he became unsteady and fell while walking with the assistance of his housekeeper. He lost consciousness within a few minutes and died shortly thereafter.

Upon news of his death, fellow comedians and other figures in the entertainment industry gave tributes and remembrance, including Brooks, Alan Alda, Steve Martin, Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Dick Van Dyke, Carol Burnett, George Clooney, Bette Midler, Bernadette Peters, and Sarah Silverman. Cheryl Hines and Orlando Jones, two of Reiner&#x27;s co-stars in &quot;Father of the Pride&quot;, expressed their condolences on Twitter, Hines stating that he was &quot;not only an amazing comedic gift, but was also an extraordinary human being&quot;. Jones mentioned his time with Reiner during their work on &quot;Father of the Pride&quot; and expressed his gratitude for his kindness and lessons.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

Over Reiner&#x27;s long television and film career, he earned numerous awards. From his stand-up comedy albums with Mel Brooks to writing on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, he earned 11 Primetime Emmy Awards and one Grammy Award. In 1960, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6421 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1999, he was inducted into Television Hall of Fame.
In 2000, he received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center. In 2017, Carl and his son Rob Reiner became the first father-son duo to have their footprints and handprints added to a concrete slab at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater.

<text>The Summitville mine was a gold mining site in the United States, located in Rio Grande County, Colorado south of Del Norte. It is remembered for the environmental damage caused in the 1980s by the leakage of mining by-products into local waterways and then the Alamosa River.

==History==
Charles Baker&#x27;s group of prospectors found traces of placer gold in the San Juan Mountains in 1860 at Eureka, Colorado. The group was forced out in 1861 by the Ute Tribe, who had been awarded the area in a US treaty. Gold was discovered in Wightman Fork, on South Mountain, which is the same location of present-day Summitville. More prospectors returned in 1871, when lode gold was found in the Little Giant vein at Arrasta Gulch, near Silverton, Colorado. The miners were allowed to stay after the Brunot Treaty of 13 Sept. 1873. In exchange for giving up 4 million acres, the Southern Ute Indian Reservation received $25,000 per year. Gold veins were found at 11,500 feet on South Mountain in 1873 and the town was founded when stamp and amalgamation mills were built.

By 1885 there were more than 250 individual claims in operation. The site was soon mined out, with the weather of the 3,500 m high site adding to difficulties. The site was re-opened on a number of occasions for gold or other metals but with little success, and prior to the site&#x27;s acquisition in 1984 the last survey was in the early 1970s for copper. The total amount of gold extracted from the site from 1873 until 1959 was around .

In 1984 an area of was acquired by the Canadian-based Galactic Resources Ltd. subsidiary Summitville Consolidated Mining Company, Inc. (SCMCI). They began a new large-scale open pit operation covering . New techniques were used to extract gold from otherwise uneconomic ore.

The mining involved the treatment of pyritic ore with a sodium cyanide solution to leach the gold out of the ore—heap leaching (see also cyanide process). The solution (leachate) was then removed from the ore and the valuable metals extracted using activated carbon. SCMCI leached around 10 million tons of ore on a heap leach pad. The mining operations were finished in October 1991 with the leaching continuing until March 1992, when Galactic Resources filed for bankruptcy. A total of of gold and of silver were recovered. SCMCI then closed the site and converted on-site equipment for the detoxification process, with around 160 million U.S. gallons (610,000 m3) of stored water needing treatment. After the company insolvency proceedings were completed in a British Columbia court, the US Government declared the site a superfund cleanup site and spent $155,000,000 of public funds cleaning up the site.

==Cease-and-desist order and aftermath==
In 1991 SCMCI was served with a cease-and-desist order by the state government, concerned with metal levels in nearby water due to the run-off of excess water from the heap leach pad and through the damaged pad liner. Possibly 85,000 US gallons (320 m3) of contaminated water had leaked into nearby creeks. In December 1992 Galactic Resources Ltd. declared itself bankrupt and declared that the site clean-up operations would halt immediately. The site clean-up was undertaken by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), from 1994 under Superfund Emergency Response. The main problem was the contaminated water held in an inadequate pond system. Another source of contamination was water leaking from older underground workings. The EPA estimated that 3,000 US gallons (11 m3) were leaking from the site every minute. However, despite the water having a pH of around 3 (acidic), a USGS study stated that the run-off was no serious threat.

$155 million was spent on the site for detoxification and to reduce leakage. Robert Friedland, the chairman of Galactic Resources Ltd. paid around $30 million in settlement. Heavy metals and acid from the mine are suspected to have killed stocked fish in downstream reservoirs on the Alamosa River in 1990. Although cyanide from the heap leach pads also leaked in the watershed, cyanide is believed to have quickly volatilized into the atmosphere without damaging downstream aquatic life.

==Natural versus man made pollution==
Rocks in the Summitville area were millions of years ago subjected to acid-sulfate alteration, which causes the streams that drain the area to be naturally acidic and naturally high in metals. The very names of nearby creeks are evidence of poor natural water quality: Iron Creek, Alum Creek, and Bitter Creek. Mining at Summitville, by exposing more rock surface to weathering, increased acidity and concentrations of dissolved metals in runoff from the mine area. The degradation in Summitville runoff water quality has its origin in both decades-old mining structures, such as the Reynold&#x27;s adit, and the open-pit mining of 1985–1992.

Water runoff from the Summitville mine flows down Wightman Fork, mixes with naturally acidic runoff from unmined areas, flows into the Alamosa River and flows out of the mountains into the San Luis Valley, where it is used for crop irrigation. A United States Geological Survey investigation arrived at three major conclusions:

Extreme acid-rock drainage is the dominant long-term environmental concern at the Summitville mine and could have been predicted given the geological characteristics of the deposit. Extensive remedial efforts are required to isolate both unweathered sulfides and soluble metal salts in the open-pit area and mine-waste piles from weathering and dissolution.

It is likely that natural contamination adversely affected water quality and fish habitat in the Alamosa River long before and will continue to have adverse effects even when acid drainage from Summitville is remediated. Thus, reasonable natural conditions for the Alamosa River must be established in order to set realistic remediation conditions for the Summitville site.

Results of studies as of late 1993 indicate that mining at Summitville has had no discernible short-term adverse effects on barley or alfalfa crops irrigated with Alamosa River water. Remediation of the site will help to ensure that no adverse effects occur over the longer term.

<text>Richard Oliver Postgate (12 April 1925 – 8 December 2008) was an English animator, puppeteer, and writer. He was the creator and writer of some of Britain&#x27;s most popular children&#x27;s television programmes. &quot;Bagpuss&quot;, &quot;Pingwings&quot;, &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot;, &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;, &quot;Clangers&quot; and &quot;Pogles&#x27; Wood&quot;, were all made by Smallfilms, the company he set up with collaborator, artist and puppet maker Peter Firmin. The programmes were originally broadcast by the BBC from the 1950s to the 1980s. In a 1999 BBC poll &quot;Bagpuss&quot; was voted the most popular children&#x27;s television programme of all time.

==Early life==
Postgate was born in Hendon, Middlesex, England, into the Postgate family, as the younger son of journalist and writer Raymond Postgate and his wife Daisy (née Lansbury), making him the cousin of actress Angela Lansbury and maternal grandson of Labour politician, and sometime leader, George Lansbury. His other grandfather was the Latin classicist John Percival Postgate. His brother was the microbiologist and writer John Postgate FRS. Another aunt was Margaret Cole, the socialist politician.

==Education==
Postgate was educated at the private Woodstock School on Golders Green Road in Finchley in northwest London and Woodhouse Secondary School, formerly known from 1923 onwards as Woodhouse Grammar School, also in Finchley (and now renamed Woodhouse College), followed by Dartington Hall School, a progressive private boarding school in Devon.

==Life and career==

Postgate joined the Home Guard in 1942 while studying at the Kingston School of Art, but when he became liable for military service during the Second World War the following year, he declared himself a conscientious objector, as his father had done during the First World War. He was initially refused recognition; he accepted a medical examination as a first step to call up, and then reported for duty with the Army in Windsor, but refused to put on the uniform. He was court-martialled and sentenced to three months in Feltham Prison. This qualified him to return to the Appellate Tribunal, where he was granted exemption conditional upon working on the land or in social service, the unserved portion of his sentence being remitted. He worked on farms until the end of the war, when he went to occupied Germany, working for the Red Cross in social relief work.

===Career===
On return to the UK, from 1948 he attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, but drifted through a number of different jobs, never really finding his niche.

In 1957 he was appointed a stage manager with Associated-Rediffusion, which then held the ITV franchise for London. Attached to the children&#x27;s programming section, he thought he could do better with the relatively low budgets of the then black and white television productions. Postgate wrote &quot;Alexander the Mouse,&quot; a story about a mouse born to be king. Using an Irish-produced magnetic system – on which animated characters were attached to a painted background, and then photographed through a 45-degree mirror – he persuaded Peter Firmin, who was then teaching at the Central School of Art, to create the background scenes. Postgate later recalled they undertook around 26 of these programmes live-to-air, which were made harder by the production problems encountered by the use and restrictions of using magnets.

After the success of &quot;Alexander the Mouse&quot;, Postgate agreed a deal to make the next series on film, for a budget of £175 per programme. Making a stop motion animation table in his bedroom, he wrote the Chinese story &quot;The Journey of Master Ho&quot;. This was intended for deaf children, a distinct advantage in that the production required no soundtrack which reduced the production costs. He engaged an honorary Chinese painter to produce the backgrounds, but as the painter was classical Chinese-trained he produced them in three-quarters view, rather than in the conventional Egyptian full-view manner used for flat animation under a camera. This resulted in the Firmin-produced characters looking as though they were short in one leg, but the success of the production provided the foundation for Postgate with Firmin to start up his own company solely producing animated children&#x27;s programmes.

===Smallfilms===

Setting up their business in a disused cowshed at Firmin&#x27;s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, Postgate and Firmin worked on children&#x27;s animation programmes. Based on concepts which mostly originated with Postgate, Firmin did the artwork and built the models, while Postgate wrote the scripts, did the stop motion filming and many of the voices. Smallfilms was therefore able to produce two minutes of film per day, ten times as much as a conventional animation studio, with Postgate moving the cardboard pieces himself, and working his 16 mm camera frame-by-frame with a home-made clicker. As Postgate voiced many of the productions, and also narrated WereBear stories, his distinctive voice became familiar to generations of children.

They started in 1959 with &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;, a series for ITV about a Welsh steam locomotive who wanted to sing in a choir, based on Postgate&#x27;s wartime encounter with Welshman Denzyl Ellis, who used to be the fireman on the Royal Scot. (It was remade in colour for the BBC in 1976 and 1977.) This was followed by &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot; for the BBC, which established Smallfilms as a reliable source to produce children&#x27;s entertainment, when there were only two television channels in the UK. Postgate later described the &quot;gentlemanly and rather innocent&quot; business thus:

Postgate had strict views on story-line development, which perhaps resultantly restricted the length of each particular series development. When asked if the &quot;Clangers&quot; adventures were quite surreal sometimes, Postgate replied:

===Other activities===
In the 1970s Postgate and Firmin worked with Michael Rosen on a Teaching to Read series on BBC Schools TV called &quot;Sam on Boff&#x27;s Island&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s Postgate was active in the anti-nuclear campaign, addressing meetings and writing several pamphlets including &quot;The Writing on the Sky&quot;.

In 1986, in collaboration with the historian Naomi Linnell, Postgate painted a &quot;Illumination of the Life and Death of Thomas Becket&quot; for a book of the same name, which is now in the archive of the Royal Museum and Art Gallery, Canterbury. In 1990 he painted a similar work on Christopher Columbus for a book entitled &quot;The Triumphant Failure.&quot; &quot;A Canterbury Chronicle,&quot; a triptych by Postgate commissioned in 1990 hangs in the Great Hall of Eliot College on the University of Kent&#x27;s Canterbury campus.

Postgate narrated the six-part BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Elastic Planet&quot; in 1995.

In his later years, he blogged for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. Postgate&#x27;s voice was heard once more in 2003, as narrator for &quot;Alchemists of Sound&quot;, a television documentary about the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. On 15 July 2007, he was guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. He was also a guest on The Russell Brand Show on 19 January 2008 where he discussed the making of Bagpuss and his subsequent work in TV and Film.

In 1987 the University of Kent at Canterbury awarded an honorary degree to Postgate, who stated that the degree was really intended for Bagpuss, who was subsequently displayed in academic dress.

==Personal life==
Postgate married Prudence &quot;Prue&quot; Myers in 1957, becoming stepfather to her three children. The couple had twins in 1959 (Stephen and Simon), and another son in 1964 (Daniel Postgate). Prue died of cancer in 1982. Naomi Linnell was his partner for the last twenty-three years of his life.

Postgate&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, was published in 2000, and after Oliver died in 2008 his son Daniel wrote an afterword which was added at the end of the book.

His grandfather was Labour Party leader (1932-1935) George Lansbury and he was cousin to English born American actress Angela Lansbury. He is distantly related to the Australian-born writer and academic Coral Lansbury, whose son Malcolm Turnbull became the 29th Prime Minister of Australia.

==Death==
Postgate died at a nursing home in Broadstairs, near his home on the Kent coast, on 8 December 2008, aged 83.

After his death there was huge recognition of his influence and effect on British culture, and affection for the role his work had played in many people&#x27;s lives. His work was widely discussed in the UK media and many tributes were paid to him and his work across the internet. Charlie Brooker dedicated a portion of his &quot;Screenwipe&quot; show to Oliver Postgate, and the way he influenced Brooker&#x27;s own childhood, in an episode that was broadcast the day after Postgate&#x27;s death.
