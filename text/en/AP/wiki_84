<text>Anniston is a city and the county seat of Calhoun County in Alabama, United States, and is one of two urban centers/principal cities of and included in the Anniston–Oxford Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 23,106. According to 2019 Census estimates, the city had a population of 21,287. Named &quot;The Model City&quot; by Atlanta newspaperman Henry W. Grady for its careful planning in the late 19th century, the city is situated on the slope of Blue Mountain.

==History==

===Civil War===
Though the surrounding area was settled much earlier, the mineral resources in the area of Anniston were not exploited until the Civil War. The Confederate States of America operated an iron furnace near present-day downtown Anniston, until it was destroyed by raiding Union cavalry in early 1865. Later, cast iron for sewer systems became the focus of Anniston&#x27;s industrial output. Cast iron pipe, also called soil pipe, was popular until the advent of plastic pipe in the 1960s.

===Woodstock Iron Company===

In 1872, the Woodstock Iron Company, organized by Samuel Noble and Union Gen. Daniel Tyler, rebuilt the furnace on a much larger scale, and started a planned community named Woodstock, soon renamed &quot;Annie&#x27;s Town&quot; for Annie Scott Tyler, Daniel&#x27;s daughter-in-law and wife of railroad president Alfred L. Tyler. Anniston was chartered as a town in 1873.

Though the roots of the town&#x27;s economy were in iron, steel, and clay pipe, planners touted it as a health resort, and several hotels began operating. Schools also appeared, including the Noble Institute, a school for girls established in 1886, and the Alabama Presbyterian College for Men, founded in 1905. Careful planning and easy access to rail transportation helped grow Anniston. In 1882, Anniston was the first city in Alabama to be lit by electricity. By 1941, Anniston was Alabama&#x27;s fifth largest city.

===World War I and II===
In 1917, at the start of World War I, the United States Army established a training camp at Fort McClellan. On the other side of town, the Anniston Army Depot opened during World War II as a major weapons storage and maintenance site, a role it continues to serve as munitions-incineration progresses. Most of the site of Fort McClellan was incorporated into Anniston in the late 1990s, and the Army closed the fort in 1999 following the Base Realignment and Closure round of 1995.

===Civil Rights era===
Anniston was the center of national controversy in 1961 when a mob bombed a bus filled with civilian Freedom Riders during the American Civil Rights Movement. As two Freedom buses were setting out to travel the south in protest of their civil rights following the Supreme Court case saying bus segregation was unconstitutional, one headed to Anniston, and one to Birmingham, Alabama, before finishing in New Orleans. The Freedom Riders were riding an integrated bus to protest Alabama&#x27;s Jim Crow segregation laws that denied African Americans their civil rights. One of the buses was attacked and firebombed by a mob outside Anniston on Mother&#x27;s Day, Sunday, May 14, 1961. Prior to the bus being firebombed, attackers broke windows, and slashed tires, using metal pipes, clubs, chains and crowbars, before the police came to escort the bus away. The bus was forced to a stop just outside of Anniston, in front of Forsyth and Sons grocery, by more mob members. As more windows were broken, rocks and eventually a firebomb were thrown into the bus. As the bus burned, the mob held the doors shut, intent on burning the riders to death. An exploding fuel tank caused the mob to retreat, allowing the riders to escape the bus. The riders were viciously beaten as they tried to flee, where warning shots fired into the air by highway patrolmen prevented the riders from being lynched on the spot. A 12-year-old girl, Janie Forsyth, set out against the mob with a bucket of water and cups to help the Riders, first tending to the one who had looked like her own nanny. Forsyth and Son grocery is located along Alabama Highway 202 about west of downtown. The site today is home to a historic marker and was designated Freedom Riders National Monument by President Barack Obama in January 2017.

In response to the violence, the city formed a bi-racial Human Relations Council (HRC) made up of prominent white business and religious leaders, but when they attempted to integrate the &quot;whites-only&quot; public library on Sunday afternoon, September 15, 1963 (the same day as the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham), further violence ensued and two black ministers, N.Q. Reynolds and Bob McClain, were severely beaten by a mob. The HRC chairman, white Presbyterian minister Rev. Phil Noble, worked with an elder of his church, Anniston City Commissioner Miller Sproull, to avoid KKK mob domination of the city. In a telephone conference with President John F. Kennedy, the President informed the HRC that after the Birmingham church bombing he had stationed additional federal troops at Fort McClellan. On September 16, 1963, with city police present, Noble and Sproull escorted black ministers into the library. In February 1964, Anniston Hardware, owned by the Sproull family, was bombed, presumably in retaliation for Commissioner Sproull&#x27;s integration efforts.

On the night of July 15, 1965, a white racist rally was held in Anniston, after which Willie Brewster, a black foundry worker, was shot and killed while driving home from work. A $20,000 reward was raised by Anniston civic leaders, and resulted in the apprehension, trial and conviction of the accused killer, Damon Strange, who worked for a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Historian Taylor Branch called the conviction of Damon Strange a &quot;breakthrough verdict&quot; on p. 391 of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, &quot;At Canaan&#x27;s Edge&quot;. Strange was convicted by an all-white Calhoun County jury to the surprise of many people, including civil rights leaders who had planned to protest an acquittal. This was the first conviction of a white person for killing a black person in civil rights era Alabama.

Anniston was a 1978 winner of the All-America City Award, presented by the National Civic League.

===PCB contamination===
PCBs were produced in Anniston from 1929 to 1935 by the Swann Chemical Company. In 1935 Monsanto Industrial Chemicals Co. bought the plant and took over production, which continued until 1971. In 1969, the plant was discharging about of the chemicals into Snow Creek per day, according to internal company documents.

In 2002, an investigation by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; revealed Anniston had been among the most toxic cities in the country. The primary source of local contamination was a Monsanto chemical factory, which had already been closed. The EPA description of the site reads in part:
The Anniston PCB site consists of residential, commercial, and public properties located in and around Anniston, Calhoun County, Alabama, that contain or may contain hazardous substances, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) impacted media. The Site is not listed on the NPL, but is considered to be a NPL-caliber site.

==Geography==
At the southernmost length of the Blue Ridge, part of the Appalachian Mountains, Anniston&#x27;s environment is home to diverse species of birds, reptiles and mammals. Part of the former Fort McClellan is now operating as Mountain Longleaf National Wildlife Refuge to protect endangered Southern Longleaf Pine species.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.15%, is water.

In 2003, part of the town of Blue Mountain was annexed into the city of Anniston, while the remaining portion of the town reverted to unincorporated Calhoun County.

Part of the city limits extend down to Interstate 20, with access from exit 188. Via I-20, Birmingham is 65 mi (105 km) west, and Atlanta is 91 mi (146 km) east.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Anniston has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Arts and culture==

In 1899, the county seat of Calhoun County moved from Jacksonville to Anniston. More than 100 years later, the community is a bustling center of industry and commerce with more than 22,000 residents. Over the years, city officials and local citizens have worked to retain the environmental beauty of the area while allowing it to thrive economically and to preserve its history. The Spirit of Anniston Main Street Program, Inc., a nonprofit organization started in 1993, spearheaded the restoration and revitalization of historic downtown Anniston, with a focus on the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare, Noble Street.

The Noble Streetscape Project encouraged local business owners to refurbish storefront façades, while historic homes throughout the downtown area have been repaired and returned to their former condition. The preservation effort included the historic Calhoun County Courthouse, located on the corner of 11th Street and Gurnee Avenue since 1900. The original building burned down in 1931, but the courthouse was rebuilt a year later. Thanks to a complete restoration in 1990, the stately structure is still in use today.

Anniston has long been a cultural center for northeastern Alabama. The Alabama Shakespeare Festival was founded in the city in 1972 and remained there until moving to Montgomery in 1985 seeking more robust financial support. The Knox Concert Series produces an annual season of world-renowned musical and dance productions, and the Community Actors&#x27; Studio Theatre community theatre organization performs plays, musicals, and revues featuring local performers, actors, and musicians. CAST also features specially funded programs to educate area children in the arts for free. The city is home to the Anniston Museum of Natural History and the Berman Museum of World History. These institutions house mummies, dioramas of wildlife, and artifacts from a bygone age in contemporary, professional displays and exhibits. The Alabama Symphony Orchestra since 2004 has performed a summer series of outdoor concerts, Music at McClellan, at the former Fort McClellan.

The city has many examples of Victorian-style homes, some of which have been restored or preserved. Several of the city&#x27;s churches are architecturally significant or historic, including the Church of St. Michael and All Angels, Grace Episcopal Church, Parker Memorial Baptist Church, and the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church, a predominantly African-American church in what is known as the Zion Hill community. Temple Beth El, dedicated in 1893, is the oldest building in the state continuously used for Jewish worship.

The original main street, Noble Street, is seeing a rebirth as a shopping and dining district in the heart of downtown.

The Chief Ladiga Trail, part of a paved rail trail with the Silver Comet Trail of Georgia, has its western terminus in Anniston.

Anniston was featured in the fifteenth episode of the Small Town News Podcast, an improv comedy podcast that takes listeners on a fun and silly virtual trip to a small town in America each week, in which the hosts improvise scenes inspired by local newspaper stories.

===Fort McClellan===
Fort McClellan—former site of the U.S. Army Military Police Training Academy, a Vietnam era Infantry Training Center, Chemical Corps Regimental Headquarters, Chemical Warfare training center, and Women&#x27;s Army Corps Headquarters—was decommissioned in the 1990s. A portion of the former fort is now home to the Alabama National Guard Training Center. Another of the fort were set aside for the Mountain Longleaf National Wildlife Refuge in 2003. The Department of Homeland Security also uses a portion of the decommissioned fort for the Center for Domestic Preparedness, the nation&#x27;s only civilian &quot;live agent&quot; training center; emergency response providers from all over the world come to Fort McClellan to be trained in dealing with live agents and weapons in a real-time, monitored setting.

==Government==
Anniston is governed by Alabama&#x27;s &quot;weak mayor&quot; form of city government. Four city council members are elected to represent the city&#x27;s four wards, and the mayor is elected at-large. Day-to-day functions of city government are carried out by the city manager, who is appointed by the mayor and city council.

The current five-member city council are Jack Draper (mayor), Jay Jenkins (Ward 1), D.D. Roberts (Ward 2), Ciara Smith (Ward 3 and vice-mayor), and Millie Harris (Ward 4).

Anniston is the county seat of Calhoun County, Alabama. Circuit and district courts for the county and the district attorney&#x27;s office are located in the Calhoun County Courthouse at the corner of 11th Street and Gurnee Avenue. Other county administrative offices are in the Calhoun County Administrative Building at the corner of 17th and Noble streets, and a United States Courthouse, part of the U.S. Alabama Northern District Court, is located at the corner of 12th and Noble streets.

==Education==
Public schools in Anniston are operated by Anniston City Schools. These include:
* Anniston High School (Grades 9–12)
* Anniston Middle School (Grades 6–8)
* Golden Springs Elementary School (Grades 1–5)
* Randolph Park Elementary School (Grades 1–5)
* Cobb Pre-School Academy (Pre-K)

Statewide testing ranks the schools in Alabama. Those in the bottom six percent are listed as &quot;failing&quot;. As of early 2018, Anniston High School was included in this category.

A public four-year institution of higher learning, Jacksonville State University, is located to the north in Jacksonville. Anniston is home to some satellite campuses of Gadsden State Community College, both at the former Fort McClellan and at the Ayers campus in southern Anniston.

There are several private primary and secondary schools in Anniston, including:
* Faith Christian School
* Sacred Heart of Jesus School, a longstanding Roman Catholic school
* The Donoho School, a K–12 college-preparatory school

An obelisk installed in 1905 commemorates &quot;Dr. Clarence J. Owens, president of the Anniston College for Young Ladies&quot;.
Former schools in Anniston include the Anniston Normal and Industrial School (1898–c. 1915), a private Baptist school for African American students during the time of segregation.

==Media==
Anniston is served by two daily newspapers: &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; statewide edition, and the local 25,000 circulation daily paper, &quot;The Anniston Star&quot;. Anniston-based Consolidated Publishing Co., publisher of &quot;The Anniston Star&quot;, also owns and operates advertising-supported newspapers in nearby Jacksonville, Piedmont and Cleburne County. Local radio stations include WHMA AM and FM and WHOG 1120 AM.

WEAC-CD is the only television station that directly broadcasts from the Anniston area, but many Birmingham stations have towers and news bureaus here, such as WJSU-TV (WJSU is a local broadcast station for Birmingham-based ABC 33/40), WBRC-TV (Fox), and WVTM-TV (NBC). Alabama Public Television erected its tallest tower atop Cheaha Mountain south of Anniston. WJSU-TV 40 was historically a local CBS affiliate, broadcasting local newscasts daily.

Formerly its own Arbitron-defined broadcast market, today Anniston is a part of the Birmingham-Anniston-Tuscaloosa television designated market area. Radio stations are divided into three sub markets within that market; Anniston is in the Anniston-Gadsden–Talladega radio sub market.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The following major highways pass through Anniston:

* U.S. Highway 431 (Anniston Eastern Bypass/Golden Springs Road)
* State Route 21 (Quintard Avenue/McClellan Boulevard)
* State Route 202

The Anniston Western Bypass runs from Interstate 20 in Oxford (the Coldwater exit) and runs north into the present State Route 202. It is five lanes wide, handling Anniston Army Depot traffic. Future plans will extend it on the present County Road 109 by widening it to connect with US 431. State Route 202 follows this route from CR 109 (Bynum-Leatherwood Road) southward.

The Anniston Eastern Bypass was a stalled project of the Alabama Department of Transportation to build a four-lane highway in Calhoun County until revived by the 2009 federal stimulus package. It was the largest influx of federal money into the local economy since Fort McClellan closed. More than $21 million was earmarked for this project in 2005. This funding was spent acquiring rights of way and grading a section of the proposed bypass from Oxford to the community of Golden Springs. As of April 2009, the section was a graded, but undriveable, clay dirt road bed. The Eastern Bypass was revived by the 2009 Federal Stimulus Package and was opened to traffic into McClellan on the northwest end in January 2011. As of December 2015, the route is now open to traffic and carries US-431 from the Saks community southward.

Amtrak serves Anniston with its Crescent service, operating to and from New Orleans and New York. Southbound trains depart at 10:30am, and northbound trains depart at 6:59pm (central time).

The Areawide Community Transportation System (ACTS) provides fixed-route bus and paratransit services within Anniston and Oxford. The service operates Monday through Friday from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM and on Saturdays from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. There is no service on Sundays.

===Anniston Army Depot===
Anniston is home to the Anniston Army Depot which is used for the maintenance of most Army tracked vehicles. The depot also housed a major chemical weapons storage facility, the Anniston Chemical Activity, and a program to destroy those weapons, the Anniston Chemical Agent Disposal Facility. In 2003, the Anniston Army Depot began the process of destroying the chemical weapons it had stored at the depot and at Fort McClellan. An incinerator was built to destroy the stockpile of Sarin, VX nerve agent, and mustard blister agent stored at the depot. Destruction of the weapons was completed in 2011. The incinerator and related operations were officially closed in May 2013, and the incinerator was disassembled and removed from the depot at the end of 2013.

<text>Hobson City is a town in Calhoun County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 759. It is included in the Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan Statistical Area. Hobson City became Alabama&#x27;s first self-governed all-black municipality in 1899 and continues to have an African American majority.

The town of Hobson City, originally known as Mooree Quarters, was a Black settlement established in 1868 within a section of Oxford, Alabama. In 1890, a pivotal moment occurred when a Black man ran for Justice of the Peace in Oxford.  Mayor Whitehead threatened that if the Black candidate won, he would redraw the town’s boundary lines to exclude Mooree Quarters. When the Black man won the election, the threat was carried out, and in 1896, Mooree Quarters was officially removed from Oxford’s town limits.

Under the 1899 Alabama Constitution, voting eligibility was restricted by stringent requirements, including being a male over 21, owning at least 40 acres of land, paying taxes, holding a steady job for 12 months, and being able to read and understand the Constitution. Despite these barriers, some Black property owners met the criteria and were permitted to vote in local elections. Twenty such men, who qualified under these terms, played a key role in the incorporation of the town.

For nearly three years, Mooree Quarters existed as an unincorporated settlement within the county. Determined to take control of their future, a committee of residents sought the advice of attorney Ross Black in Anniston, Alabama. At the time, Black attorneys were barred from practicing law in the state. Ross Black recommended that the community incorporate their territory into an independent municipality. On July 20, 1899, approximately 125 Black residents of Mooree Quarters submitted a petition to Calhoun County Probate Judge E. F. Cook, requesting to establish their own distinct town. After completing the necessary legal steps, the town was officially incorporated on August 16, 1899, becoming the first city in Alabama founded solely by and for Black citizens. S. L. Davis was elected as Hobson City’s first mayor. The town was named in honor of Richard P. Hobson, a white naval hero of the Spanish-American War and a member of the Alabama Legislature.

The town was incorporated on August 16, 1899. Records from a contemporary Alabama newspaper, &quot;The Peoples&#x27; Journal&quot;, described the municipality as &quot;the only municipality controlled and governed entirely by colored people anywhere in the United States.&quot; The newspaper further commented, &quot;The whole country will doubtless be interested in the result of this experiment.&quot; Under the leadership of the first mayor, S. L. Davis, and the first police chief, James Duran, police protection was restored to the area. The town was named after Richmond P. Hobson, a white naval hero in the then-recent Spanish-American War and member of Congress. Newman O&#x27;Neal was the mayor in 1919 until he faced death threats and was assaulted by the Ku Klux Klan forcing him to flee the city.

The mayor in 1970, J. R. Striplin, was its thirteenth black mayor in succession. The town has buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Jacksonville is a city in Calhoun County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2020 census the population was 14,385, which is a 14.6% increase since 2010 and a 71.2% increase since 2000. It is included in the Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is home to Jacksonville State University, which is a center of commerce and one of the largest employers in the area.

==History==
Jacksonville was founded in July 20, 1833, on land purchased from Creek Indian Chief &quot;Du-Hoag&quot; Ladiga. First called Drayton, the town was renamed to honor President Andrew Jackson in 1834. There are several Civil War monuments in town, including a statue of Major John Pelham in the city cemetery and a statue of a Confederate soldier in the middle of the square. Jacksonville served as the county seat for Calhoun County until the 20th century when the county seat moved to Anniston. Jacksonville State University was founded in the city in 1883.

An EF3 tornado hit Jacksonville on March 19, 2018, causing extensive damage to the city and the university of almost $42 million. The relatively low number of casualties – just four injuries – was attributed by some to the fact that the university was on spring break at the time. More than 1,000 volunteers assisted in the immediate tornado relief. Caleb Howard, then a senior at Jacksonville State University, said that &quot;[i]t&#x27;s been amazing to see the university and the community come together.&quot; Classes resumed at the university the following month. Although the university&#x27;s usual site for graduation, Pete Mathews Coliseum, was damaged in the tornado along with over 20 other buildings, the first spring graduation since the tornado proceeded as scheduled on May 4 outside the football stadium. Dr. John Beeler, the university&#x27;s president, said &quot;It&#x27;s a joyous event generally because you&#x27;re celebrating the accomplishments of all your graduates, but it&#x27;s an even more joyous event because to me it&#x27;s a celebration of how far we&#x27;ve come in a short time in recovering from these tornadoes.&quot;

<text>Ohatchee (inc. 1956) is a town in Calhoun County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 1,157. It is included in the Anniston–Oxford, Alabama Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Andrew Jackson used the area around present-day Ohatchee to prepare for the Battle of Talladega. Lyncoya Jackson was orphaned by the Battle of Tallushatchee in November 1813 and later sent to Jackson&#x27;s Hermitage in Tennessee where he was raised. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis in 1828.

The site of the battle is marked with a large stone marker along Alabama Highway 144 between Alexandria and Ohatchee, near Tallaseehatchee Creek.

Between 1863 and 1864, Alfred A. Janney built a furnace, now named Janney Furnace, to produce pig iron for the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. The furnace never went into production, but locals often speak of the quality of the construction because the structure was supposedly built by slaves. The site is now a part of the Calhoun County Park System and features a Civil War memorial alongside a Civil War and Native American museum. The site hosts a town festival every year that includes vendors, children&#x27;s activities, music, and a Civil War reenactment.

Ohatchee became an incorporated town in 1956. On March 25, 2021, an EF3 tornado struck the town, killing six residents.

<text>Oxford is a city in Calhoun, Talladega, and Cleburne counties in the State of Alabama, United States. The population was 22,069 at the 2020 census. Oxford is one of two principal cities of and included in the Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan Statistical Area, and it is the largest city in Calhoun County by population.

==History==
Founded in the early 1850s, Oxford was the first city in Calhoun County to be incorporated, in 1852. The name &quot;Oxford&quot; was due to the presence of a narrow crossing of Chocolocco Creek that allowed farmers to ford cattle from one side of the creek to the other. Since 1970, Oxford has annexed large amounts of land to the south and west, including the communities of Coldwater and Bynum. In 1970, it was all in Calhoun County, but today it includes areas in Talladega County and Cleburne County.

A smaller municipality, Hobson City, was once a part of Oxford. The area, then known as the Mooree Quarter, is one square mile, and is located north and west of Oxford, and south and west of Anniston. The new town became incorporated on August 16, 1899, as Hobson City, taking the name of a naval hero of the Spanish–American War. Another result was the creation of only the second town in the United States (after Eatonville, Florida) with 100% black government, and an almost 100% black population (at least at first).

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.07%, is water.

Oxford lies among the foothills at the southern end of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Nearby Cheaha Mountain is Alabama&#x27;s highest point and offers expansive views of the surrounding wilderness and the city below. Much of the city&#x27;s southern border is shared with the Talladega National Forest.

== History ==

=== Founding and early growth ===
The area now known as Piedmont is a community that began in the early 1840s, located at the crossroads of two early post roads. Major Jacob Forney Dailey of North Carolina came to Alabama in 1848 and bought land in present-day Piedmont. Major Dailey named the area Cross Plains, and an official post office with that name was established on September 22, 1851.

The Standard Coosa-Thatcher Cotton Mill was established in Piedmont in the late 1800s and was the main source of employment in and around the city for nearly a century. After being named &quot;Hollow Stump&quot; and &quot;Cross Plains&quot; local residents settled for the name Piedmont in 1888. The word Piedmont means &quot;Foot of the mountains&quot; which was more appealing to local residents since the city is surrounded by mountainous scenery.

=== Recent history ===
The Standard Coosa-Thatcher Company was a textile corporation founded in Piedmont in 1891. It was publicly traded beginning in 1922. The firm is important because of its endurance for nearly a century and its expansion throughout the southeast United States and into the western United States. Also known in Piedmont as the &quot;Cotton Mill&quot;, it began operating in 1892 and closed in 1995. In 2016, demolition of the building began. Over the next two years or so, workers tore down the mill and reclaimed more than 100-year-old lumber and other material for resale.

== Geography ==
Piedmont is located at According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.67%, is water. The city is located less than an hour and forty five minutes from large cities such as Atlanta Georgia, Birmingham Alabama, Chattanooga Tennessee and Huntsville Alabama. Piedmont lies on the eastern border of the state of Alabama, near the border of Georgia. Piedmont is located between Gadsden Alabama and Cedartown Georgia via US highway 278 (West/East) and between Centre Alabama and Jacksonville Alabama/Jacksonville State University via Alabama highway 21 and Alabama highway 9 (North/South). The nearest interstates are I-59 via US highway 278 (Gadsden) and I-20 via Alabama highway 21 or Alabama highway 9 (Anniston/Oxford).

== Attractions ==

=== Chief Ladiga Trail ===
Piedmont is home to the Chief Ladiga Trail. The Seaboard/CSX Railroad was converted into a recreational bike and walking trail as a non-motorized way to travel, exercise, and relax while enjoying the outdoors. The Chief Ladiga Trail and the Silver Comet Trail stretch nearly from Anniston to Atlanta, making it the second-longest paved trail in the United States (the longest being the Paul Bunyan in Minnesota)..

Duggar Mountain Wilderness

Dugger Mountain, the second highest peak in Alabama with an elevation of 2,140 feet (650 m), is located just outside the city limits of Piedmont, which is the closest city to the peak and wilderness area.

The wilderness encompasses some of the most rugged and mountainous terrain in Alabama, as well as numerous endangered and threatened plant communities. It is one of the last intact roadless areas in Alabama&#x27;s National Forests. Most of the mountain&#x27;s 16,000 acres (6,500 ha) were too steep to profitably timber harvest. The Pinhoti National Recreation Trail winds through the wilderness area.

Duggar Mountain

Standing at 2,140 feet, Duggar Mountain is Alabama&#x27;s second highest point, only trailing nearby Mt. Cheaha. Duggar Mountain is known for its hiking trails and scenery. Piedmont lies at the foot of Duggar Mountain, making it visible from most points in and around the city.

Terrapin Creek

There are several canoe and kayak rental services near Terrapin Creek, as well as areas to camp and fish. Thousands of people access this area annually to &quot;float the creek&quot; and enjoy the natural environment of the area.

=== Cheaha Challenge ===
Hundreds of cyclists from more than 20 states participate in the Cheaha Challenge every year. The &quot;Toughest Ride in the South&quot; is a recreational bicycle ride that has been moved to Anniston, AL from Piedmont&#x27;s Civic Center. The ride follows the Appalachian Highlands Scenic Byway then ends at the top of Cheaha Mountain, Alabama&#x27;s highest point. The Cheaha Challenge was selected as a Top 10 Event in the State of Alabama by the Alabama Bureau of Tourism &amp; Travel.

====Night in the Museum Hotel====

This historic home has been relocated from its original location in Piedmont to a location downtown, near the Old Railroad Depot and Museum. Constructed in the late 1800s, this home is believed to be one of the first homes constructed in the Piedmont area. This home is utilized as a two bedroom hotel, as well as a museum. Bedrooms are for rent in the historic Roberts House and include a tour of the museum. The new location of the home is ideal since it is near Piedmont&#x27;s downtown business district that includes dining, coffee shops, a bar and a variety of stores. The Night in the Museum Hotel is just two blocks from the Chief Ladiga Trail. This exhibit is new to the area and the Roberts House was recently renovated by the city. The Piedmont Historical Society, an IRS qualified 501(c)3 non-profit educational organization that operates the Southern Train Depot Museum, began a preservation project by raising funds and support to first relocate the home to its present site (75 Southern Boulevard) with the purchase of old railroad bed land from Norfolk Southern Railroad Company and second to renovate the home to its original Victorian state, as a safe public museum facility to display artifacts of Piedmont’s history and as a unique “Night In the Museum” Hotel for bikers and hikers of the Chief Ladiga Trail and visitors traveling through the Appalachian Mountains.

<doc id="103754" wikidata="Q1133919" url="?curid=103754" title="Sparky Anderson">
<text>George Lee &quot;Sparky&quot; Anderson (February 22, 1934 – November 4, 2010) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) player, coach, and manager. He managed the National League&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds to the 1975 and 1976 championships, then added a third title in 1984 with the Detroit Tigers of the American League. Anderson was the first manager to win the World Series in both leagues. His 2,194 career wins are the sixth-most for a manager in Major League history. His 1,331 wins with the Tigers are the most for any manager in team history. Anderson was named American League Manager of the Year in and . He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Bridgewater, South Dakota, on February 22, 1934. He moved to Los Angeles, California, at the age of eight. He was a batboy for the USC Trojans. He attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School in Los Angeles. Upon graduating, he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent in .

Anderson&#x27;s American Legion team won the 1951 national championship, which was played in Briggs Stadium (Tiger Stadium) in Detroit.

Anderson married Carol Valle on October 3, 1953. They had first met when each was in the fifth grade.

==Playing career==
Anderson began his playing career with the Santa Barbara Dodgers of the Class-C California League, where he was primarily used as a shortstop. In , he was moved up to the class-A Pueblo Dodgers of the Western League and was moved to second base, where he played the rest of his career.

In , Anderson was moved another step up the minor league ladder, playing for the Double-A Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League. A radio announcer gave him the nickname &quot;Sparky&quot; in 1955 for his feisty play. In , he moved up once more, this time to the Triple-A Montreal Royals of the International League. In , he was assigned to the Los Angeles Angels of the open-classification Pacific Coast League. The next season, after the Dodgers&#x27; move to Los Angeles, he returned to Montreal.

After five minor league seasons without appearing in a Dodger uniform at the MLB level, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on December 23, 1958, for three players, including outfielder Rip Repulski. The Phillies gave Anderson their starting second base job, and he spent what would be his one full season in the major leagues in 1959. However, he batted only .218 in 152 games, with no home runs and 34 runs batted in, and returned to the minor leagues for the remainder of his playing career.

He played the next four seasons with the Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League. After watching several practices, Leafs owner Jack Kent Cooke observed Anderson&#x27;s leadership qualities and ability to teach younger players from all backgrounds. Cooke immediately encouraged him to pursue a career in managing, offering Anderson the post for the Leafs.

==Managerial career==

===Minor leagues===
In 1964, at the age of 30, Anderson accepted Cooke&#x27;s offer to manage the Leafs. He later handled minor league clubs at the Class-A and Double-A levels, including a season (1968) in the Reds&#x27; minor league system.

During this period, he managed four pennant winners in four consecutive seasons: 1965 with the Rock Hill Cardinals of the Western Carolinas League, 1966 with the St. Petersburg Cardinals of the Florida State League, 1967 with the Modesto Reds of the California League, and 1968 with the Asheville Tourists of the Double-A Southern League. It was during the 1966 season that Anderson&#x27;s club lost to Miami 4–3 in 29 innings, which remains the longest pro game played (by innings) without interruption.

He made his way back to the majors in 1969 as the third-base coach of the San Diego Padres during their maiden season in the National League.

===Cincinnati Reds===
Just after the 1969 season ended, California Angels manager Lefty Phillips, who as a Dodger scout had signed the teenager Anderson to his first professional contract, named Anderson to his 1970 coaching staff.
Within a day of being hired in Anaheim, he was offered the opportunity to succeed Dave Bristol as manager of the Cincinnati Reds. His appointment reunited Anderson with Reds&#x27; general manager Bob Howsam, who had hired him as a minor-league skipper in the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati organizations. Anderson was named the Reds manager on October 8, 1969. Since he was a relative unknown in the sports world, headlines on the day after his hiring read &quot;Sparky Who?&quot; At the time of his hiring, Anderson was, at 35, the youngest skipper in baseball. Nonetheless, Anderson would become the third manager to lead a team to 100 wins as a rookie manager, doing so by leading the Reds to 102 wins and the National League pennant in , where they lost the 1970 World Series in five games to the Baltimore Orioles. During this season, the Reds came to be widely known as the Big Red Machine, a nickname they carried throughout Anderson&#x27;s tenure.

After an injury-plagued 1971 season in which the team finished fourth, the Reds came back and won another pennant under Anderson in 1972, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates in five games in the NLCS, but losing to the Oakland Athletics in seven games in the World Series. They took the National League West division title again in , but lost to the New York Mets in the NLCS, a hard-fought series that went the full five games.

After finishing a close second to the Los Angeles Dodgers in , in the Reds blew the division open by winning 108 games. They swept the National League Championship Series and then edged the Boston Red Sox in a drama-filled, seven-game World Series. They repeated in by winning 102 games, sweeping the Phillies in three games in the National League Championship Series, then going on to sweep the New York Yankees in the Series; the only time that a team swept the League Championship Series and World Series since the start of division play. Over the course of these two seasons, Anderson&#x27;s Reds compiled an astounding 14–3 record in postseason play against the Pirates, Phillies, Red Sox and Yankees, winning their last eight in a row in the postseason after beating the Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series, and then winning seven straight games in the 1976 postseason. They remain the only team to sweep the entire post-season since the inception of the league championship series in 1969.

During this time, Anderson became known as &quot;Captain Hook&quot; for his penchant for taking out a starting pitcher at the first sign of weakness and going to his bullpen, relying heavily on closers Will McEnaney and Rawly Eastwick.

When the aging Reds finished second to the Dodgers in each of the next two seasons, Anderson was fired on November 27, 1978 by general manager Dick Wagner, who had taken over for Howsam a year earlier. Wagner wanted to &quot;shake up&quot; the Reds&#x27; coaching staff, to which Anderson objected, leading to his dismissal.

Under new manager John McNamara, the Reds won the division title again in , but lost three straight games to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the League Championship Series. They would not make the playoffs again until they won the World Series in by sweeping the heavily favored Oakland Athletics.

===Detroit Tigers===
The Detroit Tigers hired Anderson as their new manager on June 14, . Upon seeing the team&#x27;s young talent, he boldly proclaimed to the press that his team would be a pennant winner within five years. The Tigers became a winning club almost immediately, finishing above .500 in each of Anderson&#x27;s first three full seasons, but did not get into contention until , when they won 92 games and finished second to the Baltimore Orioles in the American League East.

In , Detroit opened the season 9–0, was 35–5 after 40 games (a major league record), and breezed to a 104–58 record (a franchise record for wins). On September 23, Anderson became the first manager to win 100 games in a season with two different teams. They swept the Kansas City Royals in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) and then beat the San Diego Padres in five games in the World Series for Anderson&#x27;s third world title. The 1984 Tigers became the first team since the 1927 New York Yankees to lead a league wire-to-wire, from opening day to the end of the World Series. After the season, Anderson won the first of his two Manager of the Year Awards with the Tigers.

After the Tigers clinched the AL East division title in 1984, Anderson wrote in his journal: &quot;I have to be honest. I’ve waited for this day since they fired me in Cincinnati. I think they made a big mistake when they did that. Now no one will ever question me again.&quot;

Anderson&#x27;s Tigers finished in third place in both 1985 and 1986. With a 9–5 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on July 29, 1986, Anderson became the first to achieve 600 career wins as a manager in both the American and National Leagues.

Anderson led the Tigers to the Major Leagues&#x27; best record in 1987, but the team was upset in the ALCS by the Minnesota Twins. He won his second Manager of the Year Award that year. After contending again in 1988 (finishing second to Boston by one game in the AL East), the team collapsed a year later, losing a startling 103 games. During that 1989 season, Anderson took a month-long leave of absence from the team as the stress of losing wore on him. First base coach Dick Tracewski managed the team in the interim.

In 1991, the Tigers finished last in batting average, first in batting strikeouts and near the bottom of the league in most pitching categories, but still led their division in late August before settling for a second-place finish behind the rival Toronto Blue Jays.

On September 27, 1992, the Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 13–3 for Anderson&#x27;s 1,132nd win with the team, passing Hughie Jennings as the all-time leader in wins by a Tiger manager. Anderson continues to hold this distinction with 1,331 victories with the Tigers. On April 15, 1993, he won his 2,000th game as manager with a 3–2 victory over the Oakland Athletics, becoming the seventh manager to do so.

During his managerial career, Anderson was known to heap lavish praise on his ballplayers when talking to the media. He declared Kirk Gibson &quot;the next Mickey Mantle,&quot; which he later acknowledged may have put too much pressure on Gibson early in his career. He said Mike Laga, who played for him in 1984, would &quot;make us forget every power hitter who ever lived.&quot; He also said Johnny Bench (who played for him in Cincinnati) &quot;will never throw a baseball as hard as Mike Heath&quot; (a catcher who played for him in Detroit).

Anderson is the last American League manager to date to win a game by forfeit. This came a month after being hired in Detroit when, as a result of Disco Demolition Night in Chicago, the second half of a doubleheader with the Chicago White Sox had to be called off after an anti-disco demonstration went awry and severely damaged the playing surface at Comiskey Park. Even after White Sox groundskeepers removed debris from the field, Anderson refused to let the Tigers take the field. He was not only concerned for the safety of his players, but believed the field was unplayable. When American League officials initially made plans to postpone the game until the next afternoon, Anderson demanded that the game be forfeited to the Tigers. He argued that the White Sox, as the home team, were obligated to provide acceptable playing conditions. The next day, American League President Lee MacPhail largely upheld Anderson&#x27;s argument and forfeited the second game to the Tigers, 9–0.

===Managerial record===

==Retirement==
Anderson retired from managing on October 2, 1995, reportedly disillusioned with the state of the league following the 1994 strike that had also delayed the start of the 1995 season. It is widely believed that Anderson was pushed into retirement by the Tigers, who were unhappy that Anderson refused to manage replacement players during spring training in 1995. In an interview on Detroit&#x27;s WJR radio after his retirement, Anderson said he had told his wife that season, &quot;If this is what the game has become, it don&#x27;t need me no more.&quot;

He finished with a lifetime record of 2,194–1,834, for a .545 percentage and the third-most wins for a Major League manager at the time (behind only Connie Mack and John McGraw). His win total has since been surpassed by Tony La Russa, Bobby Cox, and Joe Torre, placing him sixth on the all-time list. Anderson spent the largest portion of his career managing the Tigers (1970–78 with the Reds, 1979–95 with the Tigers), winning the World Series twice with Cincinnati and once with Detroit.

===Post-managerial work===
Both during his tenure with the Tigers, and for a time afterward, Anderson did some television work as a baseball commentator and analyst. From 1979 to 1986 (with the exception of 1984), Anderson was often paired with Vin Scully and later Jack Buck on CBS Radio&#x27;s coverage of the World Series. From 1996 to 1998, he became a color analyst for the Anaheim Angels&#x27; cable television broadcasts.

While still in Detroit, Anderson founded the charitable organization CATCH (Caring Athletes Teamed for Children&#x27;s and Henry Ford hospitals) in 1987, which helped to provide care for seriously ill children whose parents do not have health insurance or the means to otherwise pay for the care. He continued to support and participate in the charity well into his retirement. When interviewed in 2008, Anderson said that CATCH was &quot;the single best thing I ever did in Detroit.&quot;

===Honors===
Anderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 2000. Although he managed 17 seasons in Detroit and just 9 seasons in Cincinnati, his Hall of Fame plaque has him wearing a Cincinnati Reds uniform. He chose to wear the Reds cap at his induction in honor of former GM Bob Howsam, who gave Anderson his first chance at a major-league managing job. Before his induction, Anderson had refused to go inside the Hall because he felt unworthy, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t ever want to go into the most precious place in the world unless I belonged.&quot; In his acceptance speech he gave a lot of credit to his players, saying there were two kinds of managers, &quot;One, it ain&#x27;t very smart. He gets bad players, loses games and gets fired. There was somebody like me that was a genius. I got good players, stayed out of the way, let &#x27;em win a lot, and then just hung around for 26 years.&quot; He was very proud of his Hall induction, &quot;I never wore a World Series ring ... I will wear this ring until I die.&quot;

Anderson was also inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame the same year. On May 28, 2005, during pre-game ceremonies in Cincinnati, Anderson&#x27;s jersey number, #10, was retired by the Reds. A day in Anderson&#x27;s honor was also held at Detroit&#x27;s Comerica Park during the 2000 season.

On June 17, 2006, Anderson&#x27;s number was retired by the Fort Worth Cats, for whom Anderson had played in 1955. In 2007, Anderson was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

Throughout the 2011 season, the Tigers honored Anderson with a patch on their right sleeves. They officially retired his No. 11 on the brick wall at Comerica Park on June 26, 2011.

==Death and legacy==
Anderson was the first manager to win a World Series for both a National League and American League team. Either manager in the 1984 Series would have been the first to win in both leagues, since San Diego Padres (NL) manager Dick Williams had won the series with the Oakland Athletics (AL) in 1972 and 1973. Williams&#x27; 1972 club had defeated Anderson&#x27;s Reds club.

Anderson&#x27;s accomplishment was equaled in the 2006 World Series, when St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russawho had previously won the World Series with the Oakland Athletics in 1989, and who considers Anderson his mentorled his team to the title over the Detroit Tigers. Coincidentally, having won a championship while managing the Florida Marlins in 1997, Tigers manager Jim Leyland could have achieved this same feat had the Tigers defeated La Russa&#x27;s Cardinals in the 2006 World Series. During that series, Anderson threw out the ceremonial first pitch of Game 2 at Comerica Park, the Tigers&#x27; home park.

In 2006, construction was completed on the &quot;Sparky Anderson Baseball Field&quot; at California Lutheran University&#x27;s new athletic complex. Anderson had used his influence to attract notable players to the university baseball team, and he was also awarded the Laundry Medal by the university for being &quot;an inspiration to youth.&quot;

On November 3, 2010, it was announced that Anderson had been placed in hospice care at his Thousand Oaks home because of his deteriorating dementia condition. Anderson died the next day at the age of 76 in Thousand Oaks. He was survived by his wife of 57 years, Carol, sons Lee and Albert, daughter Shirlee Engelbrecht, and eight grandchildren. Carol died at age 79 on May 7, 2013, at home in Thousand Oaks.

On June 26, 2011, the Detroit Tigers honored Anderson by retiring his number 11 from future use and placing his name and number on the outfield wall with the other past honorees and members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Tiger players also wore commemorative patches on their uniform sleeves all season.

==Media appearances==
* In 1979, Anderson guest-starred as himself on an episode of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. The episode (titled &quot;Sparky&quot;), features Anderson as a talk-show host on the fictional station. Eventually Anderson is let go, prompting him to say, &quot;I must be nuts. Every time I come into this town, I get fired!&quot;
* Anderson appeared as himself in &quot;The White Shadow&quot; season 3 episode &quot;If Your Number&#x27;s Up, Get it Down&quot; in 1980. Falahey introduces him to Coolidge, but Coolidge replies with &quot;Sorry you lost, but I voted for you.&quot; Coolidge mistakenly thought he was 1980 independent presidential candidate John Anderson.
* Anderson appeared as himself in the 1983 Disney Channel movie &quot;Tiger Town&quot;.

<text>Scouting in [[New Hampshire]] has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

== Early history (1910-1950) ==
In 1912, two years after the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) was founded in the United States, the Manchester Council (#330), a volunteer-led council, was organized. Initially, only two troops were chartered by the YMCA. As Scouting grew in popularity, three more makeshift and unrecognized councils sprang up in Dover, Claremont, and Portsmouth. The council grew steadily and added a Scout Executive to its staff in 1919.

On January 9, 1920, the Manchester Council was granted an official charter with the Boy Scouts of America. At that time, the council represented ten troops and 256 Scouts within Manchester, and 87 troops with 1,621 Scouts in New Hampshire. In 1925, the Manchester Council acquired Camp Manning in Gilmanton as a summer camp. While the Manchester Council grew rapidly, the rest of New Hampshire&#x27;s Scouting program saw limited growth.

On May 25, 1929, the Manchester Council was renamed the Daniel Webster Council (#330) and expanded to cover Scouting for the entire state. The new name was derived from New Hampshire statesman Daniel Webster.

== Recent history (1950-present) ==
The Daniel Webster Council initially operated Camp Manning in Gilmanton and Camp Carpenter in Manchester. In 1945, Camp Carpenter became the official Scout camp for the Daniel Webster Council. In 1969, under the leadership of Max I. Silber, the council established the Lawrence L. Lee Scout Museum at Camp Carpenter to recognize the council&#x27;s longtime Scout Executive. In 1971, the Daniel Webster Council acquired Hidden Valley Scout Reservation from the Norumbega Council in Massachusetts. Hidden Valley is near Gilmanton Iron Works, New Hampshire. In the late 1980s, Camp Carpenter became a Cub Scouts camp during the summer months. In the early 2000s, Hidden Valley was renamed the Griswold Scout Reservation. It was divided into two camps: Hidden Valley and the new Camp Bell.

Hidden Valley and Camp Carpenter are traditional Scout camps with full dining facilities and various program areas and activities. Camp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the Patrol Method. Campers cook at their sites and participate in day-long activities as patrols. Camp Bell has a different variety of activities from Hidden Valley, including their &quot;living history areas, &quot; and a different set of merit badges are available.

Together, Hidden Valley and Camp Bell make up the Griswold Scout Reservation, which covers over including several lakes, ponds, and mountains. The land currently used primarily by Camp Bell has been used as the homes of many other camps, most recently Camp Manning, which, after being sold by the Daniel Webster Council to private owners, changed ownership several times and had previously existed as a camp run by various organization such as the YMCA who called it Camp Leo. Camp Bell was named for an attorney member of the Council&#x27;s Executive Board who was instrumental in reacquiring the property for the Daniel Webster Council.

The Council also operates three additional facilities—Pierre Hoge in Walpole, Camp Whipporwill in Merrimack, and the Unity Program Center in Unity.

=== Spirit of Adventure Council ===
With the Boston Minuteman Council and Yankee Clipper Council merging to form the Spirit of Adventure Council, the units of Yankee Clipper Council in New Hampshire have been transferred into the Daniel Webster Council, effective April 1, 2015.

On January 1, 1993, the North Essex Council, the North Bay Council, and the Lone Tree Council were merged to form the Yankee Clipper Council. In December 1999, the Greater Lowell Council was merged into the Yankee Clipper Council. Today, the council has five districts, serving a large corner of northern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. With eight towns (Atkinson, East Kingston, Hampstead, Kingston, Newton, Plaistow, Seabrook and South Hampton) located in the Lone Tree District, Yankee Clipper Council is the smaller of the two councils in the Granite State. Until 2007, Yankee Clipper Council operated Camp Onway in Raymond, New Hampshire.

==Girl Scouting in New Hampshire==
In January 2009, the Girl Scouts of Swift Water Council, which served New Hampshire and 60 towns in southeastern Vermont, merged with the Girl Scout Council of Vermont.

Girl Scouts of the Green and White Mountains serves 14,500 girls in New Hampshire and Vermont. It is one of 112 councils chartered by Girl Scouts of the USA.

==Scouting museums in New Hampshire==

In 1967, prominent Scouter Max I. Silber sought to display several articles he had acquired from his many Scout trips worldwide. Amongst other artifacts, Max had been given many personal effects of Scouting founder Robert Baden-Powell from his widow, Lady Olave Baden-Powell, including original drawings and writings from the founder. Max and his good friend Council Executive Lawrence L. &quot;Larry&quot; Lee discussed the idea of displaying the collection, and they decided to build a small museum at Camp Carpenter in Manchester. . Larry died before the museum was finished, and it was decided that it was only fitting to name the museum after him. The Lawrence L. Lee Scouting Museum opened its doors in 1969.

In 1978, the museum needed to expand, and it was decided also to build a library where the large collection of Scout books could be displayed and used to learn about Scouting&#x27;s vast history. The Museum Committee elected to name the library after Max, who on top of his great dedication and service to Scouting around the world was the catalyst for the museum&#x27;s founding.

The Lawrence L. Lee Scouting Museum and Max I. Silber Library are run by volunteer staff and a committee that keeps the museum open every Wednesday 10-4, Select Saturdays 10-3 and select days during Cub Scout Summer Camp in July and August. They never have had to charge for admission. (jb 12/24)

==Scouting events in New Hampshire==
The Daniel Webster Council sponsors a statewide Scouts BSA Jamboree every four years, a three-day program that gathers up to 5,000 Scouts and guests from New Hampshire and the surrounding areas. The most recent New Hampshire Jamboree was named &quot;NHXperience&quot; and was held May 4-6, 2018, at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon.

<text>Carriacou and Petite Martinique, also known as the Southern Grenadines, is a dependency (part) of Grenada, lying north of Grenada island and south of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the Lesser Antilles.

[[Carriacou]] Island is the largest island of the Grenadines, an archipelago in the Windward Islands chain. The island is with a population of 9,595 (2019 census). The main settlements on the island are Hillsborough, L&#x27;Esterre, Harvey Vale, and Windward.

The neighbouring island of [[Petite Martinique]] is away from Carriacou, and also a part of Grenada. With its and population of 900, it is smaller than Carriacou. Carriacou and Petite Martinique are known for its Regatta and Village Maroon.

==Colonial history==
On 27 September 1650, Jacques du Parquet bought Grenada from the Compagnie des Iles de l&#x27;Amerique, which was dissolved, for the equivalent of £1160. In 1657, Jacques du Parquet sold Grenada to Jean de Faudoas, Comte de Sérillac, for the equivalent of £1890. In 1664, King Louis XIV bought out the independent island owners and established the French West India Company. In 1674, the French West India Company was dissolved. Proprietary rule ended in Grenada, which became a French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.

Carriacou and Petite Martinique was part of the French colony in 1762. It was part of the British Grenada colony from 1763 to 1779 and 1783–1974. It was part of the French Grenada colony from 1779 to 1783. During this turbulent period, most of the land on Carriacou and all of the property on Petite Martinique was owned by a free black woman, Judith Philip, and her family members. It has been a dependency of Grenada since 1974.

==Geography==
Carriacou is the largest of the Grenadines and is characterized by hilly terrain sloping to white sand beaches. The island stretches from Pegus Point in the south to Gun Point in the north and it is about long.

The island has several natural harbors and many coral reefs and small offshore islets.

The highest point on the island is High Point North at above sea level. Carriacou has no rivers. Residents rely on rainfall for their water.

===Islands===
===Climate===
There are two seasons, wet and dry. The dry season is between January and June when the trade winds dominate the climate; the rainy season is from July to December. The climate is tropical. Temperatures range from on land, with water temps.

==Politics==
Carriacou and Petite Martinique is a Grenadian Constituency. Tevin Andrews, NDC, is the representative for Carriacou and Petite Martinique Constituency and also the Minister of Carriacou and Petite Martinique Affairs. The Grenadian constitution of 1974 guarantees a right to autonomy and local government for Carriacou and Petite Martinique, but this has never been implemented. In 2022, the government of Dickon Mitchell introduced a bill to parliament to establish a local Council for Carriacou and Petite Martinique. 

==Festivals==
There are four major cultural festivals held on Carriacou and one on Petite Martinique. Carriacou Carnival, called &quot;Kayak Mas&quot;, is held during the days leading up to Lent in late February or early March. The Carriacou Regatta, held on the first weekend in August, is a racing event for locally built boats. The Regatta began in 1965, making it the longest running regatta in the Caribbean. The Parang, on the weekend prior to Christmas, celebrates the island&#x27;s traditional Christmas music and culture. Village Maroons take place year round, and involve villagers partaking in cooking traditional foods and the &quot;Big Drum Dance&quot;. The Carriacou Maroon &amp; String Band Music Festival is held in the last weekend of April of the year. Petite Martinique&#x27;s Whitsuntide Regatta Festival takes place annually on Whitsuntide weekend, and consists of boat races, performances, and other activities.

==Transport==
Carriacou and Petite Martinique&#x27;s main transport system includes roads and ferries. The people of Carriacou travel mainly by privately run 15 seater buses. Rental cars and taxis are also available and boats are commonplace. Lauriston Airport, located in Lauriston, Carriacou, is the island&#x27;s major airport, and a small ferry boat known as the &quot;Osprey&quot; runs between Carriacou, Grenada, and Petite Martinique. The short distances between the Grenadines also enable travel between them by small boats.

<text>Hermann von Siemens (9 August 1885 in Berlin – 13 October 1986 in Munich) was a German industrialist of the Siemens family.

== Life==
He was the eldest son of Arnold von Siemens who himself was the eldest son of Werner von Siemens, the famous inventor and founder of &quot;Siemens &amp; Halske&quot;, later to become the present-day Siemens AG. Hermann&#x27;s mother Ellen, née von Helmholtz, was a daughter of Werner&#x27;s close friend Hermann von Helmholtz, after whom his grandson was named. He was the eldest of five children.

After studying physical chemistry at Heidelberg University and becoming PhD, Hermann von Siemens started his career as an employee of the physical-chemical laboratory of Siemens &amp; Halske, Berlin. In Heidelberg Siemens joined the student fraternity Leonensia. In 1928 he became a member of the management board of Siemens &amp; Halske. In 1929 he took over responsibility for the central laboratory of the company. He significantly contributed to the development of teleprinters. In 1935 he became member of the management board of a sister company, Siemens-Schuckertwerke AG. He also became a member of the supervisory boards of Vereinigte Stahlwerke, Mannesmann, Krupp and Deutsche Bank.

Before 1933 he was a member of the German National People&#x27;s Party, a rival and opponent of Hitler&#x27;s National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party. From 1941 until 1946 he succeeded his uncle Carl Friedrich von Siemens as chairman of the Supervisory Boards of Siemens &amp; Halske AG and Siemens-Schuckertwerke AG and thus became head of the German electrical and electronics company. As head of a company important for the production of war materials, the German government enqueued him among the &quot;Wehrwirtschaftsführer&quot;. Siemens-Schuckert had to employ some skilled labor among deported people inside and outside of concentration camps. During the final years of World War II, numerous plants and factories in Berlin and other major cities were destroyed by Allied air raids. To prevent further losses, manufacturing was moved to alternative places and regions not affected by the air war. The goal was to secure continued production of important war-related and everyday goods. According to records, Siemens was operating almost 400 alternative or relocated manufacturing plants at the end of 1944 and in early 1945.

Arrested on 5 December 1945 by Allied Forces, he temporarily ceded the chairmanships to his father&#x27;s first cousin Friedrich Carl Siemens (1877–1952). He was brought to the Nuremberg trials as a prisoner to deal with war crime charges, but finally no prosecution was filed, as there were no personal misdeeds traceable. The charges were dropped, so he could return as head of company in 1948.
He again served as chairman of the supervisory boards of &quot;Siemens &amp; Halske AG&quot; and &quot;Siemens-Schuckertwerke AG&quot; until his retirement in 1956. All factories in the Soviet occupation zone as well as most factories abroad were lost and had to be replaced. During this period of time, his first cousin Ernst von Siemens was CEO of Siemens &amp; Halske AG from 1949 until 1956 and eventually succeeded Hermann as chairman of both companies in 1956. Because of the Berlin Blockade, Hermann and Ernst shifted the headquarters of Siemens from sieged Berlin to Erlangen, the production site of Siemens-Schuckert, in 1947 and to Munich in 1949. There they rented the Palais Ludwig Ferdinand from the former Bavarian Royal Family and eventually bought it in 1957. The palace still today continues to house the Siemens headquarters. In 1950, Hermann von Siemens donated his parents&#x27; sumptuous residence at Wannsee in Berlin to the Baptist Church which converted it to a hospital.

Hermann von Siemens significantly contributed to the company&#x27;s reconstruction and development after World War II. Himself rather a silent, introverted and technical-oriented person, he took special interest in all matters of scientific research and enhanced it in many ways. In the 1950s and from their new base in Bavaria, S&amp;H started to manufacture computers, semiconductor devices, washing machines, and pacemakers. From 1955 until 1964 Hermann von Siemens also served as president of the scientific Fraunhofer Society. After Ernst von Siemens merged the three &quot;parent companies&quot; Siemens &amp; Halske, Siemens-Schuckert and Siemens-Reiniger to form the present-day Siemens AG in 1966, Hermann continued to be an ordinary member, later an honorary member of the supervisory board until his death in 1986 at the age of 101.

In 1917, he married Charlotte von Maltzan, Baroness zu Wartenberg und Penzlin; they had six children and 12 grandchildren, among them the granddaughter Nathalie von Siemens (b. 1971), formerly chairperson of the Siemens Foundation and since 2015 a member of the supervisory board of Siemens AG.

<text>Scouting in Vermont has a long history, from the 1907 to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1907–1950)==
===Boy Scouts of America===
In 1910, the Burlington Council (#592) was formed, changing its name to the Champlain Council (#592) in 1926. The council closed in 1926.

In 1916, the Brattleboro Council was formed, closing in 1921.

In 1920, the Rutland Council was formed. The Rutland County Council (#593) became the Green Mountain Council (#593) in 1929. It became the Ethan Allen Council (#593) in 1965. It became the Green Mountain Council (#592) in 1972.

In 1926, the Owl Council (#762) was formed. It merged with the Green Mountain Council (#593) in 1930.

In 1926, the Windham-Windsor Council (#747) was formed. It changed its name to the Calvin Coolidge Council (#747) in 1936. It merged with the Ethan Allen Council (#593) in 1965.

In 1933, the Long Trail Council (#592) was formed. It merged with the Green Mountain Council (#592) in 1972.

===1910 Camp Iliam, Pownal===
On September 10, 1910, S. F. Lester of Troy, New York, became the first person to hold the Scouting leadership position of Scoutmaster (approved by the BSA). He received his certification from the BSA headquarters in New York City. In 1910 he led a group of 30 scouts at Camp Ilium, in Pownal, Vermont. Camp Ilium was the starting point of the Boy Scout Movement for Troy, and Pownal. Pownal is only away from Troy.

===Junior Boy Scouts===
Junior Scouts existed in the British Boy Scouts (BBS) in 1909 and in Barre, Vermont for boys under age 11. This junior scout concept was later mirrored in Baden Powell&#x27;s organization as Wolf Cubs or Cubs in 1916. The BSA started Cub Scouting in 1930. There is a complete Vermont Junior Scout uniform which dates to this 1909-1910 period. It is all hand stitched with a hand embroidered patch which reads &quot;Junior Scout&quot;. It is probably the oldest American Boy Scout uniform that exists.

===Camp Fire Girls of America===
Founded on March 17, 1910, in Thetford, Vermont, by Dr. Luther Gulick and his wife Charlotte Vedder Gulick. Camp Fire Girls, as it was known at the time, was created as the sister organization to the Boy Scouts of America. The First Baptist Church of Barre also had a very early Camp Fire Girls organization around the same time the Thetford organization started.

===Girl Scouts of the USA===
The first known troop in Vermont was in Wilder in 1918.

The 50th anniversary of Girl Scouting was celebrated at a Senior Girl Scout Roundup held at Button Bay in Vergennes, Vermont in 1962. The U.S. Postal Service set up a temporary post office with a special postal stamp and cancellation for the occasion. Thousands of Girl Scouts came to the international Roundup. A reunion was held for the centennial of Girl Scouting in September 2012 in Vergennes. The Girl Scout council that now encompasses all of Vermont and all of New Hampshire was established in 2009 and is called Girl Scouts of the Green and White Mountains.

===Norman Rockwell===
Norman Rockwell moved here and created his most important artwork in Arlington from 1939 through 1953.

==Recent history (1950–2010)==
International Girl Scout gatherings named Senior Roundups were held every three years from 1956 until 1965. The third one was held at Button Bay, Vermont from July 27 to August 3, 1962, with 9,000 girls in attendance.

On May 16, 2000, Gordon Lew, the scouting program director announced that the Long Trail Indian Camp was cancelled for the entire 2000 season due to concerns raised by Charles Yow, an attorney representing the American Indian Movement in New England. Yow expressed concerns about many activities at the camp, though his primary concern was the use of a sweat lodge by children - not only because of the spiritual significance of the lodge, there were concerns of the potential dangers the children would be exposed to from the intense heat. While Jerry Lupien, the executive director of the Green Mountain Council, claimed that Native Americans assisted in authenticating the camp&#x27;s activities, Hal Grosser, the camp&#x27;s program founder, would not name a single Native person that had consulted with the camp that summer. Additionally, Chief April St. Francis of the Vermont Abenaki stated that her band had never been contacted by camp employees for consultation.

In January 2009 Girl Scouts of Swift Water Council which served New Hampshire and also southeastern Vermont for 50 years merged with the 48-year-old Girl Scout Council of Vermont.

==Current Boy Scouts of America in Vermont==
:Green Mountain Council
In the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), all of the state of Vermont is located in the Green Mountain Council. The Green Mountain Council is divided into four districts based upon geographical area. These four districts provide the program for the thousands of Scouts and Units served throughout the Council.

===Organization===

The council is divided into the following districts:

*Ethan Allen District
*Calvin Coolidge District
*Long Trail District
*Three Rivers District

In 2007 there were five districts in the Green Mountain Council. The Three Rivers District has replaced the Land of Champs and the Maple Leaf Districts.

===Camps===

Its Scout Camp is the Mount Norris Scout Reservation in Eden, Vermont and Cub Scout Camp is Camp Sunrise in Benson, Vermont.

===Order of the Arrow===

*Order of the Arrow – Ajapeu Lodge #351

==Girl Scouting in Vermont==

In January 2009 Girl Scouts of Swift Water Council which served New Hampshire and 60 towns in southeastern Vermont merged with the Girl Scout Council of Vermont to form the Girl Scouts of the Green and White Mountains. The council serves 14,500 girls across New Hampshire and Vermont.

===Vermont service center===
*Waterbury

===Vermont Girl Scout camps===
*Camp Farnsworth is over near Thetford. It surrounds Lake Abenaki. It was started as a girls&#x27; camp in 1909 and became a Girl Scout camp in 1959. In 2009 its 100th anniversary was celebrated.

==George W. Magee Memorial Trust Fund==

The George W. Magee Memorial Trust Fund is a Massachusetts-based trust whose proceeds are used to support the purchase and improvement of the camps operated by BSA Councils in Massachusetts.

===History===
George W. P. Magee was a theatrical agent and manager who most notably managed Boston&#x27;s Grand Opera House from the 1890s through 1916. Being very involved in the community, he saw Scouting as a program making significant positive impact on the lives of young men. He turned this belief into a permanent commitment to Scouting, by establishing a trust upon his death.

George Magee died in 1939, with France Cornell and Frederick W. Cook becoming the original Trustees of the fund. It took nearly 5 years, until 1944, for the fund to reach the minimum level for income to be distributed ($500,000). In 1944, the fund distributed $11,000. Upon the death of Mr. Cornell in 1961, the Old Colony Trust Company became the sole corporate trustee of the fund.

===Today===

As of 2004, the fund had a market value of approximately $7.3 million, with an annual distribution of $210,000. Over its lifetime, the fund has contributed over $6.2 million to hundreds of projects, impacting over a million youth, at various Boy Scout camps. Funds are held by the Private Bank at Bank of America, the current successor of the Old Colony Trust Company, and they are advised by a committee composed of local Scouting professionals and volunteers. Many Massachusetts camps conduct a &quot;Magee Night&quot; competition or other similar event to celebrate Mr. Magee&#x27;s contribution, and it is quite easy to find buildings named after Mr. Magee or with plaques bearing his name.

Councils requesting money typically make proposals to the advisory committee, stating the purpose of the project, the amount being requested, and any moneys being provided through other sources. Only Councils located in Massachusetts are eligible, although as the will reads the camps that benefit may be located elsewhere in New England.

==Girl Scout Councils in Massachusetts==
There are three Girl Scout councils serving Massachusetts, one of which is headquartered in Rhode Island.

===Girl Scouts of Central and Western Massachusetts===

Girl Scouts of Central and Western Massachusetts serves 15,000 girls in 186 communities. It was formed by a merger in early 2008 of three councils: Girl Scouts of Montachusett Council, Girl Scouts of Pioneer Valley, Girl Scouts of Western Massachusetts.

<text>Scouting in Connecticut has experienced many organizational changes since 1910. With only eight counties, Connecticut has had 40 Boy Scout Councils since the Scouting movement began in 1910. In 1922, 17 Boy Scout Councils existed in Connecticut, but currently only four exist. The Girl Scouts of the USA has had at least 53 Girl Scout Councils in Connecticut since their program began in 1912. Today there is one, Girl Scouts of Connecticut, which assumed operation on October 1, 2007.

==Boy Scouts of America==

===Current councils===

Connecticut has had as many as forty Boy Scouts of America councils since 1910. Currently five councils exist in Connecticut. Four Councils (Connecticut Rivers, Connecticut Yankee, Greenwich and Housatonic) are located within the state of Connecticut. The fifth, Narragansett Council in Rhode Island, serves the youth in the community of Pawcatuck, Connecticut.

All in all, these Councils serve more than 61,700 boys, young men and women in all facets of the Scouting program. They are led by a volunteer group numbering well over 15,000 men and women. 627 young men were awarded their Eagle Badge in 2005.

In 2005, Scouts gave the citizens of Connecticut well over 750,000 community service hours, ranging from Eagle Scout projects and Scouting for Food to participating in the National Good Turn for America initiative.

The four Connecticut councils operate over of camp grounds which served over 8,700 boys and girls in Scouting, as well as several more thousands of non-Scouts that use Scout camps throughout the year.

====Connecticut Rivers Council====

Connecticut Rivers Council is the largest of the four Connecticut-based Councils. It serves the youth in 127 communities, covering six and a half of the eight counties in Connecticut and Fishers Island, New York.

====Connecticut Yankee Council====

Connecticut Yankee Council serves 37 communities which covers half of New Haven county and most of Fairfield counties.

====Greenwich Council====
Greenwich Council serves one Connecticut community, the town of Greenwich.

====Housatonic Council====

Housatonic Council serves 5 communities in the Naugatuck Valley region.

====Narragansett Council====

The Narragansett Council&#x27;s insignia and shoulder patch list &quot;RI MA CT&quot; as the states in which it operates. The council serves all of Rhode Island and several entire counties in Massachusetts. However, the &quot;CT&quot; portion is limited to the village of Pawcatuck, along the Pawcatuck River that separates Connecticut from Rhode Island. Pawcatuck is in the town of Stonington, whose other units are part of the Connecticut Rivers Council.

===Defunct councils===

====Alfred W. Dater Council====
The Alfred W. Dater Council #078, headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, came about from a name change of Stamford Council in 1938. Alfred W. Dater had served as the first president of the Stamford Council until his death in February 1938. On December 2, 1938, in honor of his 22 years of service to Stamford Council, the council was renamed in his honor.

The council grew through the 1940s and in 1947 John Sherman Hoyt donated of land in Norwalk, Connecticut for use for short-term camping. After that the camp was named Five Mile River Camp.

As Scouting celebrated its 40th anniversary in February 1950, the Council joined in by paying its last mortgage payment on Camp Toquam. The Council reported that it was serving 3,269 boys and adults and plans to build their own Scout headquarters in Glenbrook section of Stamford, Connecticut. The building was sponsored by the Union Memorial Church and financed by donations from the Lions Club and by selling a portion of the Five Mile River Camp.

The purchase of the Williams Training Center in the late 1950s was made possible by selling the remaining portion of Five Mile River Camp. The Ponus Lodge #521 of the Order of the Arrow was established in 1956.

The Council celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1967 with 2,620 registered Scouts. In 1971, the Council reported 3,000 registered Scouts. The following year, the Boy Scout Councils of Alfred W. Dater, Mauwehu and Pomperaug voted to consolidate their operations into a new Council. In 1972 the Council ceased operations and the new one, Fairfield County Council, began its history.

=====Ponus Lodge=====
Ponus Lodge #521 was the OA lodge for the Alfred W. Dater Council. Their name comes from the chief of the Rippowam Tribe. Their lodge totem is a &quot;false face&quot; Iroquois mask in the image of &quot;Hoba Mako&quot; (rough spelling). Founded in 1956, the lodge ceased its operations when it merged with Chief Pomperaug #408 and Mauwehu #389 to form Tankiteke Lodge #313 in 1972.

====Bridgeport Council====
Bridgeport Council #065 was headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Founded in 1915, it changed its name to Pomperaug Council in 1936.

====Bristol Area Council====
Bristol Area Council #066 was headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut. It was founded in 1918 and operated until it merged with Keemosabee Council to form Nathan Hale Council in 1967.

=====Woapalane Lodge=====
Woapalane Lodge #471 was the OA lodge for Bristol Council. Their name translates to &quot;bald eagle&quot; which is also their lodge totem. The lodge was founded in 1952 and ceased operations in 1967 when it merged with Keemosahbee #234 to form Wihungen #234.

=====Camp Cochipianee=====
The camp was founded in 1928 by the Bristol Area Council. It was sold after the New Britain Area Council and the Bristol Area Councils were merged into what was then called Nathan Hale Council in 1972. The new Council changed the name of New Britain&#x27;s Camp Keemosabee into Camp Nahaco.

In 1980, a program pavilion at Camp Nahaco was enclosed and insulated. This winter shelter was dedicated in the name of Camp Cochipianee. It shares the parade field with another winter shelter named after the former Camp Keemosabee.

====Central Connecticut Council====
Central Connecticut Council #071 had its headquarters in Meriden, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Meriden Council in 1929. The Council encompassed the towns of Meriden, Wallingford, and Southington. It ceased to operate in 1978, when it was absorbed by Quinnipiac Council. It owned Camp Terramuggus. The council also owned Deer Lake Scout Reservation, later operated by the Quinnipiac Council and then the Connecticut Yankee Council until it was sold in 2022 to another organization which will continue to use it as a camp property.

=====Wangunks Lodge=====
Wangunks Lodge #274 was the OA lodge for the Central Connecticut Council. Their name translates to &quot;bend in the river&quot; in the Algonquian language. Their lodge totem is an American eagle. The lodge was absorbed into Arcoon Lodge #369 in 1978.

====Central Fairfield Council====
Central Fairfield Council #075 was headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Norwalk Council in 1933.

====Charter Oak Council====
Charter Oak Council #070, was headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Hartford Council in 1933. In 1972, the Council ceased to exist when it merged with Mattatuck, Middlesex County, Nathan Hale and Tunxis to form Long Rivers Council.

Wipunquoak Lodge #558 was the OA lodge for the Charter Oak Council. Their name translates to &quot;white oak&quot; (Lenape). Their lodge totem is the Charter Oak. The lodge was founded in 1964 and ceased operation when it merged with Kiethan #59, Mattatuck #217, Wihungen #234 and Tunxis #491 to form Eluwak #59 in 1973.

===== Lake of Isles Scout Reservation =====
The Lake of Isles Scout Reservation (LOISR) was developed by the Charter Oak Council and had its first summer camp season in 1960, the Jubilee Year of the Boy Scouts of America. The plan was to develop four camps on the more than that surrounded Lake of Isles, located in North Stonington, Ledyard and Preston townships of rural southeastern Connecticut. For 1960, Camps Pequot and Apache had been the only ones built. A third camp, Camp Cherokee, opened in 1970. This camp was designated an &quot;Explorer Base&quot; (although the Boy Scouting program was the only program that really used the camp as the Exploring program underwent drastic changes by the early 1970s) and featured patrol cooking with a central commissary. The fourth camp never got beyond the planning stage.

The Charter Oak Council merged with four other Councils in 1972 to form Long Rivers Council. By the mid-1970s, with a declining Boy Scout-age demographic nationally and declining Boy Scout membership in general due to the expanding list of organizations for adolescent boys, Long Rivers Council was faced with shutting down a number of their camps to the summer camping experience. For instance, Camp Nahaco closed to regular summer camping after 1977 (although it would occasionally re-open for long-term camping with specialty themes such as &quot;Enviro-Camp&quot;). Camp Tadma was closed in 1977, but a couple of years later opened again as a long-term Webelos Camp.

The plan for LOISR was to close Camp Pequot for two years and run Camp Apache for two years, then switch the status of the camps for the following two years. They expected this to reduce the impact of a summer camp season on the land by spreading out the wear and tear. So in 1975 and 1976, Camp Pequot was placed in &quot;conservation status&quot;, and Camps Apache and Cherokee ran during those two summers. In 1977, Camp Apache was placed in conservation status and Camp Pequot was re-opened. However, for 1979, Long Rivers Council management changed its plan and decided to keep Camps Pequot and Cherokee open permanently. For 1981, Camp Cherokee&#x27;s patrol cooking operation was moved to Camp Pequot, as an option for troops who preferred this. Thus, while still a reservation of multiple camps, by the 22nd year of operation of LOISR, only Camp Pequot remained as a summer camp.

The summer camp season also shortened as time went on. In the 1960s, both Pequot and Apache opened for eight weeks of summer camp use. By the mid-1970s, this was down to six weeks for Camp Apache. By the late seventies, Camp Pequot was only open for summer camping three weeks out of the summer. With the closure of Camp Cherokee after the 1980 season, Camp Pequot&#x27;s season expanded back to five weeks.

With the construction of the Mashantucket Pequot Casino in 1991–1992, the natural beauty and surroundings had been damaged enough to make Long Rivers Council consider selling the property to the Native American tribe and this was done in 1992. The Mashantucket nation has since converted the land into a golf course.

======Camp Apache – Lake of Isles Scout Reservation======
Camp Apache had the largest capacity of the three camps, serving as many as 400 Scouts a week at its height in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It had a large dining hall and a huge reservation chapel. It also was closest to the reservation entrance on the western shores of Lake of Isles. The Reservation Family Housing (on &quot;Knob Hill&quot;) and the Reservation Health Lodge were also located in Camp Apache.

In 1975 and 1976, Camp Apache ran for the last time during two summer seasons. In 1977, it was placed in conservation status and was never opened again as a Boy Scout Camp. Occasionally, it was rented by other groups and Scouts would continue to use Camp Apache for short-term Camporees and other district events. However, the reservation itself was not within the geographic boundary of Long Rivers Council, making other Council camps closer to the Council membership. Thus, Camp Apache was never used as much as it could have been.

======Camp Pequot – Lake of Isles Scout Reservation======
Camp Pequot was the southernmost camp on the reservation. It was mainly flat along the shoreline with a rapid rise of hills on the western side of the camp. It had a dining hall which served as many as 350 Scouts a week during the camp&#x27;s heyday in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was only slightly smaller than Camp Apache. The camp had an outdoor basketball court, which was rather unusual for most camps. Originally, the camp had eight summer campsites. Down on the flat, it included Buccaneers, Aquanauts, Mohegan, Woodsmen and Rocky Trails. The &quot;higher elevation&quot; campsites included Stockade, Bailey Hill and Hickory Hill. Later, Blueberry Hill was developed. Even later, the staff&#x27;s central campsite, near the dining hall, was converted to a campsite called Braves, with the staff lodging being dispersed so that they lived near their program areas. The Braves campsite was mainly used for boys who wanted to come to camp, but no adult leader from their troop could. The camp staff would &quot;provide&quot; the adult leadership and thus the campsite was for what was known as the &quot;provisional&quot; troop.

In the mid-1970s, the plan for LOISR was to close Camp Pequot for two years and run Camp Apache for two years, then switch the status of the camps for the following two years. So in 1975 and 1976, Camp Pequot was placed in &quot;conservation status&quot; and Camps Apache and Cherokee ran during those two summers. In 1977, Camp Apache was placed in conservation status, and Camp Pequot was re-opened. However, for 1979, Long Rivers Council management changed its plan and decided to keep Camps Pequot and Cherokee open permanently. By 1981, Camp Cherokee&#x27;s patrol cooking operation was moved to Camp Pequot, as an option for troops who preferred this. Thus, while still a reservation of multiple camps, only Camp Pequot remained as a summer camp.

The summer camp season also shortened as time went on. In the 1960s, Pequot opened for eight weeks of summer camp use, which was reduced by the end of the 1970s to only three weeks. However, with the closure of Camp Cherokee after the 1980 season, Camp Pequot&#x27;s season expanded back to five weeks.

======Camp Cherokee – Lake of Isles Scout Reservation======
Camp Cherokee opened in 1970. This camp was designated an &quot;Explorer Base&quot; at first and featured patrol cooking with a central commissary. However, the designation as an Explorer Base quickly disappeared, as Exploring became more vocationally oriented in the early 1970s, especially in Connecticut with its Police Explorer Posts. Camp Cherokee was the only camp opened on the eastern shores of Lake of Isles, which had been formed by damming a small stream. The original channel ran through the Camp Cherokee waterfront, making the drop-off between the non-swimmers&#x27; area and the beginners&#x27; area huge.

At Camp Cherokee, campsites were further subdivided into patrol sites. Each patrol site had a sheepherders stove and wall tents on wooden platforms with bunks and mattresses provided. Scouts would have to make the trek to the commissary three times a day to pick up food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and then cook it themselves. This was the logical camp in the council to hold Youth Leader Training, whether it was called JLTC, TLD or TLTC, as it had the patrol cooking arrangements. There were six troop sites throughout Camp Cherokee&#x27;s history: Sassafrass Hill, Timbertrails, Haven, Wilderness, Tunxis and Pyquag.

Camp Cherokee had all the usual program features for Scouting: a nature area, a waterfront, a place to practice scoutcraft, a rifle range and an archery range. The lower part of the camp, along the Lake of Isles shoreline, included the campsite Tunxis, the nature area and the waterfront. It was a steep climb up to the rest of the camp, which included the trading post/camp office and commissary and the other five campsites. Some needed amenities were provided at the Reservation level, such as a health lodge and lodging for families of married staff.

From 1970 until 1978, Camp Cherokee was open the same weeks as the other camps, which allowed some friendly competition between camps on opposite sides of the lake, reaching from softball games to a tug of war. Most popular was a battle between &quot;war canoes&quot;, where two 12-plus person canoes, representing each camp, headed out on the lake, determined to swamp each other by splashing water into the opponents&#x27; canoe. Another favorite activity was to out-shout the other camp during campwide campfires on Sunday evening and Friday evening.

In 1979 and 1980, with continuing declining attendance, Camp Cherokee was open for only three weeks, followed by Camp Pequot for the next three weeks. This allowed the same staff to be hired for both camps. By 1981, Camp Cherokee&#x27;s patrol cooking operation was moved to Camp Pequot. Thus, despite being the most modern facility on the Reservation, Camp Cherokee was closed for good as a Boy Scout summer camp.

====Derby Council====

In July 1972 the acting Area Chief, Jim Wardwell, brought the four lodges whose councils were to be merged in order to discuss how to merger the vibrant lodges into one (Achewon Netopalis Lodge #427 withdrew when its council decided not to be part of the merger). After several months of discussion, the three lodges held a tri-lodge dinner in December 1972. The membership voted on a new name, new lodge totem, new lodge constitution, new lodge by-laws and its first set of lodge officers. The new lodge was chartered in January 1973.

There were originally five chapters, corresponding to the six council districts: Owenoke (Stamford district), Pequot (Nutmeg District), Saganaw (Sachem and Oronoque districts), Sasqua (Sasqua district) and Scatacook (Scatacook district). In 1980, Sasqua and Owenoke chapters were merged to form Powahay chapter.

A dance team was formed in the Owenoke chapter and performed for local Scouting units, local lodges and appeared on local television report. The group won several competitions at annual section conclaves.

The lodge was also very active in section leadership, having been home to the first NE-1E Conclave Chief in 1974, and to the 1985 NE-1E Section Chief, Steve Burns of Danbury, who was elected after Steve Mimnaugh of Eluwak 59 was elected the 1985 National Chief. In one era in particular the lodge was home to several Section Chiefs in sequence, beginning in 1988 with Dave Turechek of Trumbull, who resigned partway through his term. Vice Chief George Oldroyd of Bridgeport, served as Acting Section Chief through the remainder of that term and was elected Section Chief at the conclave in 1989, serving through 1990. Sean Oldroyd, also of Bridgeport, served as his brother&#x27;s Section Secretary, and was elected Section Chief when his aged out. He was elected two years in succession before being elected Northeast Region Chief, Then Pat Sullivan of Trumbull was elected and multiple terms.

(The Oldroyd brothers were thought to have been the first brothers to serve back-to-back terms as Section Chief in the Order&#x27;s history, and it is noteworthy that the Pinnavaia brothers of Shu-Shu-Gah Lodge 24, who also served as Section Chiefs several years later, belonged to the same section, NE-3A.)

Sean Oldroyd was elected Northeast Region Chief in 1991. To commemorate this milestone, Tankiteke Lodge produced a special two-per-life lodge flap bearing the legend &quot;HOME OF THE NORTHEAST REGION CHIEF&quot;. In 1994, Oldroyd became the lodge&#x27;s first recipient of the Distinguished Service Award. Oldroyd was presented the DSA by Tom Reddin, his former Region Chairman.

It operated under the Keemosahbee name until it was renamed Nahaco to reflect the new Council (Nathan Hale Council).

The three combinations of the camp&#x27;s name and Council are represented in the main dining hall as enlarged wooden versions of the camp patches. Other amenities, such as the camp&#x27;s chapel and one of three winter shelters, reflect its original Keemosabee name. The camp distinguishes itself from others in Connecticut by using permanent Klondike-style shelters in lieu of the more common canvas platform tents.

After a series of Council mergers, the camp came into the ownership of the Connecticut Rivers Council, which hosted a Junior Leader Training Camp and a water sports merit badge camp at the site until it was sold in 2003 to the towns of Eastford and Woodstock. The towns have permanently preserved of the camp&#x27;s sparsely developed woodlands for hiking and camping, while maintaining the remaining land along Crystal Lake (including the camp center, sports field, dining hall and other camp buildings) for rental, picnicking and sports use. The Camp Nahaco Commission, which operates the camp on behalf of the two towns, also hosts a day camp program for area children.

According to the town of Eastford website, the commission is dedicated to maintaining Camp &quot;Nahaco and its facilities&quot; and &quot;preserving the natural beauty [that] Camp Nahaco affords&quot;.

=====Camp Tadma / Mark Greer Scout Reservation=====
After World War II, the Council looked to build a permanent camp for its troops. Land surrounding Tadma pond was for sale, and was purchased. The camp was developed enough to have a summer season in 1947. With five camp sites, a small dining hall, waterfront, health lodge, chapel, shower house and rifle range, it had all the amenities of a typical Scout camp of the time.

=====Camp Nahaco=====
The camp was founded in 1916 as Camp Keemosabee by the New Britain Area Council. Located on Weeks Road on the banks of Crystal Pond, in both Eastford and Woodstock, Connecticut, the camp was the Scout camp for four different Councils over its long history: originally New Britain Area Council, then Nathan Hale Council, Long Rivers Council and finally Connecticut Rivers Council. A feature most remembered of the camp is its lagoon, separated from the rest of Crystal Pond by the Causeway (bridge) and the points of the Scout Law painted on the steps at the beach that lead to the swimming area.

The merge of two former councils (the New Britain Area Council and the Bristol Area Council) into the Nathan Hale Council in 1968 come up with the amalgam of Camp NAthan HAle COuncil — NA-HA-CO : NAHACO. The entrance gate truss pattern spells out NAHACO. By 1972, the Nathan Hale Council became Nathan Hale District, but the camp still enjoyed keeping the name Nahaco in the newly formed Long Rivers Council.

A program pavilion was soon converted to a winter shelter that bears the name of Keemosabee. In 1981, another program pavilion that shares the parade field with the Keemosabee Shelter, was converted to a winter shelter and named in honor of Camp Cochipianee, which had been sold by the new Long Rivers Council. In the 1990s, the Highland District&#x27;s fundraising put a lot of time and money into Nahaco, with improvements of updating the Dining Hall kitchen with all new stainless steel. It was then when the third and final program activity pavilion was converted into a winter shelter, then named the Highland Shelter. The deteriorated camp office was razed at that time as well.

Nahaco saw its last year as a full summer camp facility in 1977. Although several Specialty Camp weeks have been run at the camp since 1977, it never regained its full-time summer camp use. It always was a favorite place for winter camping up until the mid-2000s.

A referendum vote was held by the towns of Woodstock and Eastford about the purchase of Camp Nahaco from Connecticut Rivers Council. The referendum, held on October 16, 2002, approved the plan and on March 3, 2003, the camp became town property. The two towns shared the $560,000.00 purchase price. Today, are now permanently protected from development and Boy Scouts of America is still allowed to use the property.

=====Camp Wakenah=====
Camp Wakenah is the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s second oldest camp (however, the source of this claim is questioned). It was founded in around 1917 on Gardner Lake in Salem, Connecticut. The property was sold in the 1930s to buy the second Camp Wakenah at a different location on Gardner Lake which consisted of .

In 1971, the Pequot Council (New London) merged with the Eastern Connecticut Council (Norwich) into the Indian Trails Council which had its office in New London. 1972 was the last resident camp season for Camp Wakenah. Despite the loss of the resident program, Wakenah was still used by troops for weekend camping and district events. The location was also used for a four-week Cub Scout day camp program.

Connecticut Rivers Council sold the property in 2004. Some in the area resented the sale for private use after the council had originally planned to sell the property to the town of Salem for $500,000.00. A bidding war resulted in the final $1,000,000.00 selling price.

The day camp program was moved to Camp Wakenah&#x27;s new site in the Mark Greer Scout Reservation in Bozrah. The new site was located west of Camp Tadma on the common property, separated by the parking lot. Its parade field was near the top of the pine covered hill to the right of the property&#x27;s main entrance. The parade field sat in a clearing that was originally made as a campsite. It was expanded to make room for a BB and Archery range for the day camp. Camp Wakenah &quot;III&quot; also made use of a newly constructed modular home that served as its administrative building and the existing Tadma Fort.

In 2009, Camp Wakenah expanded to encompass several other aspects of Camp Tadma, such as use of the newly constructed parade field, the dining hall for lunch, and the new Sherwood Forest area—in what had been the day camp parade field. In 2010, Camp Tadma and Camp Wakenah operate simultaneously, and use the same facilities, although programs are developed to maintain age-appropriateness.

====Pomperaug Council====
Pomperaug Council #065, was headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The Council came about from a name change of Bridgeport Council in 1936. In 1972 the Boy Scout Councils of Alfred W.

====Quinnipiac Council====

Quinnipiac Council #074, was headquartered in New Haven until 1961, when it moved to Hamden, CT. The Council came about from a name change of Southern New Haven County Council in 1935. The name Quinnipiac comes from the Native American tribe which occupied the area.

Originally formed in 1912 as the New Haven Council of the Boy Scouts of America, its headquarters was located in New Haven. After years of growth and expanding outside the boundaries of New Haven, the Council name was changed to Southern New Haven County Council in 1929. In 1935, the Council name was changed again to Quinnipiac Council. The Council absorbed the Central Connecticut Council in 1978. In 1997, the Council voted to merge with Fairfield County Council. After 85 years in existence, the Council ceased its operation on January 1, 1998, and became part of the Connecticut Yankee Council.

The council is most notable for its operation, which was a model for the rest of country. In 1943, Elbert K. Fretwell, Chief Scout Executive of the BSA, described Quinnipiac Council as an example to councils all over America for the high quality of the Scouting program being provided. Camp Sequassen was rated a double-A camp. In 1962, the Council hosted the first of many successful International Camporees. On July 4, 1962, Scouts from 14 countries assembled at Camp Sequassen.

During its existence, the Quinnipiac Council owned the follow camps: Camp Sequassen, New Hartford, Connecticut, Deer Lake Scout Reservation, Killingworth, Connecticut, Old Settlers Scout Reservation, Milford, Connecticut, and Wah Wah Tayysee Scout Reservation, Hamden, Connecticut.

=====Chi Sigma Lodge=====
Chi Sigma Lodge #369 was the original OA lodge for Quinnipiac Council. Chi Sigma started in the Quinnipiac Council in 1934 as a Scout Camp Honor Society. There was never a totem developed for the lodge. When the Boy Scouts of America began encouraging local councils to switch from their honor societies to the Order of the Arrow, the membership voted to organize Chi Sigma Lodge in 1947. The lodge was assigned the number 369 on November 19, 1947. On Monday evening, December 29, a formal installation of the lodge was held at the Council offices. The name Chi Sigma was retained rather than a Native American name in honor of Sam Bogan, founder of the earlier organization. However, in 1951, the lodge changed its name to Arcoon.

=====Arcoon Lodge=====

Arcoon Lodge #369 was the OA lodge for Quinnipiac Council. The lodge was formerly known as Chi Sigma, when it changed its name in 1953. The name Arcoon means to &quot;raccoon&quot; in Algonquin. Their totem was a raccoon with a feather.

Eager to learn more about what the Order of the Arrow was and how it could better serve the Scouts of the council, lodge leadership attended an area meeting at Camp Collier in New Hampshire in 1951. Brothers from area lodges were exchanging patches with their lodge totems on them. A committee was formed in 1951 to look for an appropriate symbol for the new lodge. Many animals of the north eastern woods were considered for a totem. A selection committee finally came up with the suggestion that the raccoon be used. All agreed as the pesky raccoon was a friend to all campers at Camp Sequassen, being a frequent visitor to camp sites and food boxes. Having chosen an appropriate animal as a totem for the lodge, the committee turned to finding a new name, which was supposed to be symbolic of the Native American background of the Order of the Arrow. After careful research the word &quot;Arcoon&quot; was recommended. The committee voted to accept both new name for the lodge and the raccoon as its totem. A contest was set up for a patch design that would best represent the new totem. With the lodge having a new name and totem, application was made to the National Order of the Arrow Secretary for a name change. Final approval was received in late 1951. Chi Sigma Lodge was officially renamed Arcoon Lodge #369.

In 1977, Quinnipiac Council absorbed the operations of Central Connecticut Council. Their lodge, Wangunks Lodge #274 was also absorbed in the operations of Arcoon Lodge #369 and became a chapter.

Arcoon Lodge received numerous awards and recognition for its dance team during its history. The lodge received National Standard Lodge status numerous times, as well as garnering the E. Urner Goodman Camping Award in 1978. Many Lodge Offices went on to serve on Section Committees and Section Offices.

In 1998, Quinnipiac Council and Fairfield County Council voted to merge the two Councils to create the Connecticut Yankee Council. Arcoon Lodge #369 was merged with Tankiteke Lodge #313 to form Owaneco Lodge #313 of the Connecticut Yankee Council in 1999.

=====Old Settlers Scout Reservation=====
In 1955, Mrs. Garland sold of land in Milford, Connecticut, to the Quinnipiac Council. The camp was used for short-term camping and Cub Scout day camp. The Boy Scouts sold the property in the 1980s to be developed for business. The sale was mainly due to the local Council needing cash to maintain other camps that were in disrepair.

<text>Lotus Software (called Lotus Development Corporation before its acquisition by IBM) was an American software company based in Massachusetts; it was sold to India&#x27;s HCL Technologies in 2018.

Lotus is most commonly known for the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application, the first feature-heavy, user-friendly, reliable, and WYSIWYG-enabled product to become widely available in the early days of the IBM PC, when there was no graphical user interface. Much later, in conjunction with Ray Ozzie&#x27;s Iris Associates, Lotus also released a groupware and email system, Lotus Notes. IBM purchased the company in 1995 for US$3.5 billion, primarily to acquire Lotus Notes and to establish a presence in the increasingly important client–server computing segment, which was rapidly making host-based products such as IBM&#x27;s OfficeVision obsolete.

On December 6, 2018, IBM announced the sale of Lotus Software/Domino to HCL for $1.8 billion.

== History ==

Lotus was founded in 1982 by partners Mitch Kapor and Jonathan Sachs with backing from Ben Rosen. By the end of that year the company offered Executive Briefing System, presentation software for the Apple II. Kapor founded Lotus after leaving his post as head of development at VisiCorp, the distributors of the VisiCalc spreadsheet, and selling all his rights to VisiPlot and VisiTrend to VisiCorp.

Shortly after Kapor left VisiCorp, he and Sachs produced an integrated spreadsheet and graphics program. Even though IBM and VisiCorp had a collaboration agreement whereby VisiCalc was being shipped simultaneously with the PC, Lotus had a superior product. Lotus released Lotus 1-2-3 on January 26, 1983. The name referred to the three ways the product could be used, as a spreadsheet, graphing tool, and database manager. The last two functions were less often used in practice, but 1-2-3 was the most powerful spreadsheet program available.

Lotus was almost immediately successful, becoming the world&#x27;s third largest microcomputer software company in 1983 with $53 million in sales in its first year, compared to its business plan forecast of $1 million in sales. In 1982, Jim Manzi — a graduate of Colgate University and The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy — came to Lotus as a management consultant with McKinsey &amp; Company and became an employee four months later. In October 1984, he was named president, and in April 1986, he was appointed CEO, succeeding Kapor. In July of that same year, he also became chairman of the board. Manzi remained at the head of Lotus until 1995.

===Dominance===

As the popularity of the personal computer grew, Lotus quickly came to dominate the spreadsheet market. Lotus introduced other office products such as Ray Ozzie&#x27;s Symphony in 1984 and the Jazz office suite for the Apple Macintosh computer in 1985. Jazz did very poorly in the market (in Guy Kawasaki&#x27;s book &quot;The Macintosh Way,&quot; Lotus Jazz was described as being so bad, &quot;even the people who pirated it returned it&quot;). Also in 1985, Lotus bought Software Arts and discontinued its VisiCalc program.

In the late 1980s, Lotus developed Lotus Magellan, a file management and indexing utility. In this period, Manuscript, a word processor, Lotus Agenda, an innovative personal information manager (PIM) which flopped, and Improv, a ground-breaking modeling package (and spreadsheet) for the NeXT platform, were released. Improv also flopped, and none of these products significantly impacted the market.

===&quot;Look and feel&quot; lawsuits===

Lotus was involved in several lawsuits, of which the most significant was the &quot;look and feel&quot; cases which started in 1987. Lotus sued Paperback Software and Mosaic for copyright infringement, false and misleading advertising, and unfair competition over their low-cost clones of 1-2-3, VP Planner and Twin, and sued Borland over its Quattro spreadsheet. This led Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, to found the League for Programming Freedom (LPF) and hold protests outside Lotus Development offices. Paperback and Mosaic lost and went out of business; Borland won and survived. The LPF filed an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief in the Borland case.

===Diversification and acquisition by IBM===
In the 1990s, to compete with Microsoft&#x27;s Windows applications, Lotus had to buy in products such as Ami Pro (word processor), Approach (database), and Threadz, which became Lotus Organizer. Several applications (1-2-3, Freelance Graphics, Ami Pro, Approach, and Lotus Organizer) were bundled together under the name Lotus SmartSuite. Although SmartSuite was bundled cheaply with many PCs and may initially have been more popular than Microsoft Office, Lotus quickly lost its dominance in the desktop applications market with the transition from 16- to 32-bit applications running on Windows 95. In large part due to its focusing much of its development resources on a suite of applications for IBM&#x27;s new (and eventually commercially unsuccessful) OS/2 operating system, Lotus was late in delivering its suite of 32-bit products and failed to capitalize on the transition to the new version of Windows. The last significant new release was the SmartSuite Millennium Edition, released in 1999.

All new development of the suite was ended in 2000, with ongoing maintenance being moved overseas. The last update release was in 2014.

Lotus began its diversification from the desktop software business with its 1984 strategic founding investment in Ray Ozzie&#x27;s Iris Associates, the creator of its Lotus Notes groupware platform. As a result of this early speculative move, Lotus gained significant experience in network-based communications years before other competitors in the PC world had even started thinking about networked computing or the Internet. Lotus initially brought Lotus Notes to market in 1989 and later reinforced its market presence by acquiring in 1991. In 1994, Lotus acquired Iris Associates. Lotus&#x27;s dominant groupware position attracted IBM, which needed to make a strategic move away from host-based messaging products and to establish a stronger presence in client-server computing, but it also soon attracted stiff competition from Microsoft Exchange Server.

In the second quarter of 1995, IBM launched a hostile bid for Lotus with a $60-per-share tender offer when Lotus&#x27; stock was only trading at $32. Jim Manzi looked for potential white knights and forced IBM to increase its bid to $64.50 per share for a $3.5 billion buyout of Lotus in July 1995. On October 11, 1995, Manzi announced his resignation from what had become the Lotus Development division of IBM; he left with stock worth $78 million.

===Assimilation of name, website, and branding===
While IBM allowed Lotus to develop, market, and sell its products under its own brand name, a restructuring in January 2001 brought it more in line with its parent company, IBM. Also, IBM moved vital marketing and management functions from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to IBM&#x27;s New York office.

Gradually, the Lotus.com website changed its &quot;About us&quot; section to eliminate references to &quot;Lotus Development Corporation&quot;. The Lotus.com web page in 2001 clearly showed the company as &quot;Lotus Development Corporation&quot; with &quot;a word from its CEO&quot; by 2002, the &quot;About us&quot; section was removed from its site menu, and the Lotus logo was replaced with the IBM logo. By 2003 an &quot;About Lotus&quot; link returned to the Lotus.com page on its sidebar, but this time identifying the company as &quot;Lotus software from IBM&quot; and showing in its contact information &quot;Lotus Software, IBM Software Group&quot;. By 2008 the Lotus.com domain name stopped showing a standalone site, instead redirecting to www.ibm.com/software/lotus, and in 2012 the site discontinued all reference to Lotus Software in favor of IBM Collaboration Solutions.

IBM discontinued development of IBM Lotus Symphony in 2012 with the final release of version 3.0.1, moving future development effort to Apache OpenOffice, and donating the source code to the Apache Software Foundation. Later that year, IBM announced it was discontinuing the Lotus brand and on March 13, 2013, IBM announced the availability of IBM Notes and Domino 9.0 Social Edition, replacing prior versions of IBM Lotus Notes and IBM Lotus Domino and marking the end of Lotus as an active brand.

On December 6, 2018, IBM announced the selling of Lotus Software/Domino to HCL for $1.8 billion.

==Corporate culture==

Lotus&#x27;s first employee was Janet Axelrod, who created the Human Resources organization and was the central figure in creating the Lotus culture. As she continued to build her organization and play a central role with senior management, she eventually hired Freada Klein as the first director of employee relations.

In 1995 Lotus had over 4,000 employees worldwide; IBM&#x27;s acquisition of Lotus was greeted with apprehension by many Lotus employees, who feared that the corporate culture of &quot;Big Blue&quot; would smother their creativity. To the surprise of many employees and journalists, IBM initially adopted a very hands-off, laissez-faire attitude toward its new acquisition.

However, by 2000 the assimilation of Lotus was well underway. While the mass employee defections that IBM feared did not materialize, many long-time Lotus employees did complain about the transition to IBM&#x27;s culture—IBM&#x27;s employee benefits programs, in particular, were singled out as inferior to Lotus&#x27;s very progressive programs.

Lotus&#x27;s headquarters in Cambridge were initially divided into two buildings, the Lotus Development Building (LDB) on the banks of the Charles River and the Rogers Street building, adjacent to the CambridgeSide Galleria. However, in 2001, President and General Manager Al Zollar decided to keep the lease of LDB. The subsequent migration of employees across the street (and into home offices) generally coincided with the final departure of employees from the company. Later, IBM&#x27;s offices at 1 Rogers St supported mobile employees, the Watson Research Center on User interface, and IBM DataPower.

IBM sponsored the &quot;Lotus Greenhouse&quot;, a community web site featuring software from IBM and its business partners.

<text>The Kingdom of Tavolara is a purported micronation on Tavolara Island, off the northeast coast of Sardinia. Set up by the Bertoleoni family, allegedly sanctioned by Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, it claims to be one of the smallest kingdoms in the world.

The island was known in ancient times as Hermea. According to tradition, [[Pope Pontian]] died in Tavolara following his abdication and exile in 235. It is probably the island previously called Tolar, which was used by some Arab ships in 848–849 as a base to attack nearby coasts.

Joachim Murat visited Tavolara in 1815 during his attempt to regain the Kingdom of Naples. At that time the island was uninhabited.

Giuseppe Bertoleoni claimed to be its monarch. When he died in the 1840s, his eldest son became King Paolo I.
During his reign, in 1861 the Italian government paid 12,000 Italian lire for land at the northeast end of the island to build a lighthouse, which began operating in 1868.
After Paolo&#x27;s death in 1886, a number of newspapers published the report that according to his will, the island had become a republic. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described a government (supposedly recognized by Italy in 1887) with a president and council of six elected every six years by a vote of the people, regardless of gender. Others reported on Tavolara&#x27;s alleged third presidential election in 1896. These reports, however, did not end the Bertoleoni kingdom.
The third king of Tavolara was Carlo I, who was succeeded upon his death in 1928 by his son King Paolo II. Paolo went abroad, however, and left Carlo&#x27;s sister Mariangela as regent in his absence. Mariangela died in 1934, leaving the kingdom to Italy.
Her nephew Paolo II still claimed the kingdom until he died in 1962, a year that marked the installation of a NATO station on the island.

The present head of the Bertoleoni family is Tonino Bertoleoni, who runs &quot;Da Tonino&quot;, a restaurant on the island. Politically, the interests of the micronation are represented in its external dealings by Ernesto Geremia of La Spezia, Liguria, Italy, who has written a history of the island.

The tomb of Paolo I is in the graveyard on the island, surmounted by a crown.

<text>Scouting in New Jersey has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

Camp Glen Gray, located in Bergen County, New Jersey (Northern New Jersey Council) has been continually active since 1917, and was originally located in a valley in the Ramapo Mountains in New Jersey. Camp Glen Gray is named after Frank Fellows Gray, (1869–1935) a well known early professional Scouter of that area. It was selected and developed by Gray to give a permanent summer camp for Scouts, and the camp is the first purpose-built Scout camp in New Jersey. Prior Scout summer camping experiments were typically temporary affairs at farm fields or church camps. Frank Gray was one of America&#x27;s earliest Scoutmasters, having started Troop 4 in Montclair, New Jersey, known as the &quot;Lord Baden-Powell Troop&quot; in March 1909. He also created an honor program that was used in New Jersey and in the Brooklyn Council called &quot;Senior Division&quot;. The camp ultimately reached a size of about and was operated by Eagle Rock Council, then Essex Council, and finally Northern New Jersey Council. In 2003, the camp was sold to the Bergen County Parks Commission and operated through a management agreement by the non-profit group Friends of Glen Gray, and is supported by a group of volunteers known as the &quot;Old Guard&quot;. While no longer an &quot;official&quot; Boy Scout Camp, it does continue to host a large number of Scouting groups and activities throughout the year, as well as hosting a summer day camp for an area special-needs school.

Notable Scout Walter Marty Schirra, Jr. (March 12, 1923 – May 3, 2007) earned the rank of First Class in Troop 36 in Oradell, New Jersey. He was one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts. He was also the only person to fly in all of America&#x27;s first three space programs (Mercury, Gemini and Apollo).

Cub Scouting Origins – To begin including younger boys to Scouting, James E. West approved the formation of the Boy Rangers of America, a separate organization for boys eight through twelve based on an American Indian theme. The Boy Rangers used the Scout Law and Chief Guide Emerson Brooks was a Boy Scout commissioner in Montclair, New Jersey. The BSA finally began some experimental Cubbing units in 1928 and in 1930 the BSA began registering the first Cubbing packs, and the Boy Rangers were absorbed. The Cub Scouting program used elements of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Jungle Book series, with the Cubmaster taking the role of Akela and the assistant Cubmaster the role of Baloo. The American program also syncretized American Indian elements, with all Cub Scouts belonging to the Webelos tribe, symbolized by the Arrow of Light and led by Akela. Webelos was also an acronym meaning Wolf, Bear, Lion, Scout. The initial rank structure was Wolf, Bear and Lion, with ages of 9, 10 and 11. Dens of six to eight Cubs were entirely led by a Boy Scout holding the position of den chief.

Mortimer L. Schiff – After a long tenure as vice-president of the BSA beginning in 1910, during which he also appeared on the cover of Time magazine on February 14, 1927, Mortimer L. Schiff was elected as president in 1931, but died after serving one month and Walter Head returned until 1946. Schiff&#x27;s mother purchased and donated of land in New Jersey and donated it to the BSA, thus creating Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation as a national training center. Both Mortimer and his son, John M. Schiff, received the Silver Buffalo Award from the BSA.

William &quot;Green Bar Bill&quot; Hillcourt – William Hillcourt was one of the BSA&#x27;s most prolific writers. He wrote numerous articles for Boys&#x27; Life and Scouting magazines, including a column aimed at patrol leaders under the by-line of &quot;Patrol Leader Green Bar Bill&quot;. At least 12,610,000 copies of his three editions of the Boy Scout Handbook were printed. Hillcourt died in Europe while on a Scouting tour in 1992. He is buried with his wife Grace in St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery in Mendham, New Jersey at Row 8, Block I, to be near Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation as he had lived for so many years. His legacy in Scouting and his influence continue in the programs and training of Scouting. Consequently, his writings are still used within the Scouting movement and his material continues to be reprinted in Scouting magazine.[21] The Hiawatha Seaway Council operates the William Hillcourt Scout Museum at Camp Woodland in New York to &quot;keep the traditions of Scouting alive&quot; through the preservation of the history that is a foundation for today&#x27;s Scouting movement

Order of the Arrow – The first Order of the Arrow ceremony for the Vigil Honor was held in New Jersey by E. Urner Goodman using Scouts from the Treasure Island Scout Reservation. The 1925 and 1936 National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meetings were held at Treasure Island, New Jersey.

==Recent history (1950–2010)==
In 1954, the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America moved its National Headquarters from New York City to a new site at the southwest corner of U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 130 in North Brunswick, New Jersey, although the location appeared in BSA publications as &quot;New Brunswick&quot;. The Johnston Historical Museum and a conservation education trail were also located there. The national headquarters moved to Irving, Texas in 1979.

In 1968, the Hudson and Alexander Hamilton councils merged to become the Hudson-Hamilton Council (#348). In 1993, the Bayonne (#332) and Hudson-Hamilton (#348) councils merged to become the Hudson Liberty Council (#348). In 1969, the North Bergen County Council (#350) changed its name to the Bergen Council (#350) in 1969. The Ridgewood-Glen Rock Council (#359) merged with the Bergen Council (#350) in 1997.

In 1972, the Aheka (#354) and Alhtaha (#355) councils merged to become the Passaic Valley Council (#353). In 1986 Tamarack Council dissolved, splitting into both the Essex (#336) and Bergen (#338) councils. In 1976, the Orange Mountain (#337), Eagle Rock (#346), and Robert Treat (#349) councils merged to become the Essex Council (#336).

On January 1, 1999, the Essex (#336), Hudson Liberty (#338), Bergen (#350), and Passaic Valley councils merged to become the Northern New Jersey Council (#333).

<doc id="103782" wikidata="Q7438574" url="?curid=103782" title="Scouting in New York">
<text>Scouting in New York has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. The first National Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Headquarters was in New York City, and the Girl Scouts of the USA National Headquarters is currently located at 420 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

==Early history (1910-1950)==
On September 10, 1910, S. F. Lester of Troy, New York, became the first person to hold the Scouting leadership position of Scoutmaster (approved by the BSA). He received his certification from the BSA headquarters in New York City. In 1910 he led a group of 30 scouts at Camp Ilium, in Pownal, Vermont. Camp Ilium was the starting point of the Boy Scout Movement for Troy, and Pownal. Pownal is only away from Troy.

Following the lead of the State of Michigan, the State of New York formed its own Forest Scouts. This group was formed in response to a number of late 19th century and early 20th century forest fires and were effectively &quot;auxiliary fire wardens&quot;.

The 1924 National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meeting was held at Kanohwanke Scout Camp near Tuxedo, New York and the 1929 National Lodge Meeting was held at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The Boy Scouts of America National Headquarters were established in 1910 in New York City and opened in January 1911.

==Recent history (1950-present)==
In the 1970s and again in the 1990s, upstate New York went through a huge consolidation of small, historic councils.

==Scouting today==

======Rotary Scout Reservation======
RSR&#x27;s totem is the Thunderbird.

Rotary Scout Reservation is a camp of the Twin Rivers Council, located in Poestenkill, New York. The original part of the camp was donated by the Troy Rotary Club in 1922. Summer camp program areas include the Trail to First Class Program, where young Scouts can work on requirements needed to earn Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class ranks. As of the 2019 season RSR offers 45 merit badges in 9 program areas. In addition to the merit badge options, RSR offers an open schedule which allows Scouts to plan their day with a variety of outdoor experiences. The camp also offers several additional program areas designed to appeal to older Scouts, which include COPE, Mountain Biking, and Chillicothe.

The Chillicothe program at RSR offers Scouts and Leaders a look at American pioneer life in the 19th century. Scouts are encouraged to try their hand at activities such as candle making, flint and steel fire starting, blacksmithing, woodsman tools, tin-smithing, blacksmithing and more. Chillicothe is a program unique to RSR, and it is an often underutilized program. It was designed to encourage the return of older Scouts who had earned most of the merit badges offered by the camp. Prior to the 2019 Camp season it was decided that the Chillicothe program area was in need of some repair, so the area itself is currently closed and the badges that were offered have been moved to other program areas. This temporary closure is expected to be only until the New Nature Science Center Pavilion is opened, at which point any new additional donations and funding will go into the rebuilding of the Chillicothe Program area.

In 2012, RSR introduced Venturing Week, a week of resident camp for youth in the Venturing Program. In addition to various open programming opportunities, offerings included a full-week half-day COPE course, American Red Cross Wilderness First Aid, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Hunter Education course, and more. Since the venture program started gaining popularity in Twin Rivers Council in 2015, the venture week itself has been canceled and venture crews have been welcomed into the normal week to week program.

During the 2014 Year the camp decided to experiment with a STEM program dedicated to the last week of the season. Keeping with the style of the camp to try and only offer badges that scouts can&#x27;t typically earn in a normal troop setting, the same has gone for STEM week. Past offerings have been the Robotics, Space Exploration, and Nuclear Sciences meritbadges. Each year the camp might have a different selection of &quot;Supernova&quot; Badges depending on available Volunteers or available skill sets of current staff members. In addition to adding merit badges during the week the camp has also offered sessions to for scouts to try and earn select BSA NOVA Awards. The Camp has also offered a few session in the past for STEM themed hobbies as well, most notable the ability for scouts to earn their Technician Ham Radio License.

The totem of the camp is the &quot;Toonerville Trolley,&quot; based on the trolley line that ran across the creek from the camp.

Each summer, the camp ran Cub Scout and Webelos resident and day camps. The camp program and facilities are specially designed for Cub Scouts, Webelos scouts, and their families. Lean-to cabins and indoor plumbing make the transition to overnight camping easier for Cub Scouts and Webelos Scouts. An archery range, BB gun range, vertical climbing wall, water slide, and movie night are all provided to appeal to younger Scouts who are spending their first nights away from home. As of 2017, summer camp programs are no longer being held and the camp is in the process of being sold.

<text>The Aventine Hill (; ; ) is one of the Seven Hills on which ancient Rome was built. It belongs to Ripa, the modern twelfth &quot;rione&quot;, or ward, of Rome.

==Location and boundaries==
The Aventine Hill is the southernmost of Rome&#x27;s seven hills. It has two distinct heights, one greater to the northwest (&quot;Aventinus Major&quot;) and one lesser to the southeast (&quot;Aventinus Minor&quot;), divided by a steep cleft that provides the base for an ancient roadway between the heights. During the Republican era, the two hills may have been recognized as a single entity.

The Augustan reforms of Rome&#x27;s urban neighbourhoods (&quot;vici&quot;) recognised the ancient road between the two heights (the modern Viale Aventino) as a common boundary between the new Regio XIII, which absorbed Aventinus Maior, and the part of Regio XII known as Aventinus Minor.

==Etymology and mythology==
Most Roman sources trace the name of the hill to a legendary king Aventinus. Servius identifies two kings of that name, one ancient Italic, and one Alban, both said to have been buried on the hill in remote antiquity. Servius believes that the hill was named after the ancient Italic king &quot;Aventinus&quot;. He rejects Varro&#x27;s proposition that the Sabines named the hill after the nearby Avens river (modern-day Velino); likewise, he believes that the Aventinus who was fathered by Hercules on Rhea Silvia was likely named after the Aventine Hill.

The Aventine was a significant site in Roman mythology. In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, a cave on the Aventine&#x27;s rocky slope next the river is home to the monstrous Cacus, killed by Hercules for stealing Geryon&#x27;s cattle. In Rome&#x27;s founding myth, the divinely fathered twins Romulus and Remus hold a contest of augury, whose outcome determines the right to found, name and lead a new city, and to determine its site. In most versions of the story, Remus sets up his augural tent on the Aventine; Romulus sets his up on the Palatine.

Each sees a number of auspicious birds (&quot;aves&quot;) that signify divine approval but Remus sees fewer than Romulus. Romulus goes on to found the city of Rome at the site of his successful augury. An earlier variant, found in Ennius and some later sources, has Romulus perform his augury on one of the Aventine Hills. Remus performs his elsewhere, perhaps on the southeastern height, the lesser of the Aventine&#x27;s two hills, which has been tentatively identified with Ennius&#x27; &quot;Mons Murcus&quot;.

Skutsch (1961) regards Ennius&#x27; variant as the most likely, with Romulus&#x27;s Palatine augury as a later development, after common usage had extended the Aventine&#x27;s name – formerly used for only the greater, northeastern height – to include its lesser neighbour. Augural rules and the mythos itself required that each twin take his auspices at a different place; therefore Romulus, who won the contest and founded the city, was repositioned to the more fortunate Palatine, the traditional site of Rome&#x27;s foundation. The less fortunate Remus, who lost not only the contest but later, his life, remained on the Aventine: Servius notes the Aventine&#x27;s reputation as a haunt of &quot;inauspicious birds&quot;.

==History==

===Roman===
According to Roman tradition, the Aventine was not included within Rome&#x27;s original foundation, and lay outside the city&#x27;s ancient sacred boundary (pomerium). The Roman historian Livy reports that Ancus Marcius, Rome&#x27;s fourth king, defeated the Latins of Politorium, and resettled them on the Aventine. The Roman geographer Strabo credits Ancus with the building of a city wall to incorporate the Aventine. Others credit the same wall to Rome&#x27;s sixth king, Servius Tullius. The remains known as the Servian Wall used stone quarried at Veii, which was not conquered by Rome until c.393 BC, so the Aventine might have been part-walled, or an extramural suburb.

The Aventine appears to have functioned as some kind of staging post for the legitimate ingress
of foreign peoples and foreign cults into Rome. During the late regal era, Servius Tullius built a temple to Diana on the Aventine, as a Roman focus for the new-founded Latin League. At some time around 493 BC, soon after the expulsion of Rome&#x27;s last King and the establishment of the Roman Republic, the Roman Senate provided a temple for the so-called Aventine Triad of Ceres, Liber and Libera, patron deities of the Roman commoners or plebs; the dedication followed one of the first in a long series of threatened or actual plebeian secessions. The temple overlooked the Circus Maximus and the Temple of Vesta, and faced the Palatine Hill. It became an important repository for plebeian and senatorial records. The Aventine&#x27;s outlying position, its longstanding association with Latins and plebeians and its extra-pomerial position reflect its early marginal status.

It is presumed that the Aventine was public land, owned by the state on behalf of the Roman people. In c.456 BC a &quot;Lex Icilia&quot; allowed or granted the plebs property rights there. By c.391 BC, the city&#x27;s overspill had overtaken the Aventine and the Campus Martius, and left the city vulnerable to attack; around that year, the Gauls overran and temporarily held the city. After this, the walls were rebuilt or extended to properly incorporate the Aventine; this is more or less coincident with the increasing power and influence of the Aventine-based plebeian aediles and tribunes in Roman public affairs, and the rise of a plebeian nobility.

Rome absorbed many more foreign deities via the Aventine: &quot;No other location approaches [its] concentration of foreign cults&quot;. In 392 BC, Camillus established a Temple of Juno Regina. Later introductions include Summanus, c. 278, Vortumnus c. 264, and at some time before the end of the 3rd century, Minerva. 

====Imperial era====
In the imperial era the character of the hill changed and it became the seat of numerous aristocratic residences, including the private houses of Trajan and Hadrian before they became emperors and of Lucius Licinius Sura, friend of Trajan who built the private Baths of Licinius Sura. The emperor Vitellius and the &quot;Praefectus urbi&quot; Lucius Fabius Cilo also lived there at the time of Septimius Severus. The Aventine was also the site of the Baths of Decius, built in 252.

This new character of an aristocratic neighbourhood was probably the cause of its total destruction during the sack of Rome by Alaric I in 410. 

The poorer population had meanwhile moved further south, to the plain near the port (&quot;Emporium&quot;) and to the other bank of the Tiber.

===Modern period===

During the Fascist period, many deputies of the opposition retired on this hill after the murder of Giacomo Matteotti, here ending—by the so-called &quot;Aventine Secession&quot;—their presence at the Parliament and, as a consequence, their political activity.

The hill is now an elegant residential part of Rome with a wealth of architectural interest, including palaces, churches, and gardens, for example, the basilica of Santa Sabina, Santi Bonifacio ed Alessio and the Rome Rose Garden.

==Cultural references==
The Aventine Hill is portrayed as a rough working-class area of ancient Rome in the popular &quot;Falco&quot; series of historical novels written by Lindsey Davis about Marcus Didius Falco, a &#x27;private informer&#x27; who occasionally works for the Emperor Vespasian and lives in the Aventine.

The same image is portrayed in much of the series &quot;Rome&quot;, in which the Aventine is the home of Lucius Vorenus. In season two, Vorenus and his friend legionary Titus Pullo seek to maintain order over the various collegia competing there for power.

The &quot;Vesta&quot;-class of starships in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels are named for Rome&#x27;s seven hills. The most featured ship is the U.S.S. &quot;Aventine&quot; under Captain Ezri Dax.

In the British television series, &quot;Plebs&quot;, the neighbourhood in which the three main plebs live is depicted as the Aventine.

<text>The Power Mac G4 Cube is a Mac personal computer sold by Apple Computer, Inc. between July 2000 and 2001. The Cube was conceived as a miniaturized but powerful computer by Apple chief executive officer (CEO) Steve Jobs and designed by Jony Ive. Apple developed new technologies and manufacturing methods for the product—a cubic computer housed in clear acrylic glass. Apple positioned it in the middle of its product range, between the consumer iMac G3 and the professional Power Mac G4. The Cube was announced at the Macworld Expo on July 19, 2000.

The Cube won awards and plaudits for its design upon release, but reviews noted its high cost compared to its power, its limited expandability, and cosmetic defects. The product was an immediate commercial failure, with only 150,000 units sold before production was suspended within one year of its announcement. The Cube is one of the rare failures for the company under Jobs, after having avoided bankruptcy. However, it influenced future Apple products, from the iPod to the Mac Mini. The Museum of Modern Art and other museums hold Cubes in their collections.

==Overview==

The Power Mac G4 Cube is a small cubic computer, suspended in a acrylic glass enclosure. The transparent plastic is intended to give the impression that the computer is floating. The enclosure houses the computer&#x27;s vital functions, including a slot-loading optical disc drive. The Cube requires a separate monitor with either an Apple Display Connector (ADC) or a Video Graphics Array (VGA) connection. The machine has no fan to move air and heat through the case. Instead, it is passively cooled, with heat dissipated via a grille at the top of the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macworld-10/2000&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The base model shipped with a 450 MHz PowerPC G4 processor, 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), 20 GB hard drive, and an ATI Rage 128 Pro video card. A higher-end model with a 500 MHz processor, double the RAM, and a 30 GB hard drive was sold only through Apple&#x27;s online store.

The Cube&#x27;s small size does not feature expansion slots; it has a video card in a standard Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) slot, but cannot fit a full-length card. The power supply is located externally to save space, and the Cube features no audio jacks. Instead, the Cube shipped with round Harman Kardon speakers and digital amplifier, attached via Universal Serial Bus (USB). Despite its size, the Cube fits three RAM slots, two FireWire 400 ports, and two USB 1.1 ports for connecting peripherals in its frame. These ports and the power cable are located on the underside of the machine. Access to the machine&#x27;s internal components is accomplished by inverting the unit and using a pop-out handle to slide the entire internal assembly out from the shell.

==Development==

The Cube was an important product to Apple, and especially to Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who said the idea for the product came from his own desires as a computer user for something between the iMac and Power Mac G4, saying, &quot;I wanted the [flat-panel] Cinema Display but I don&#x27;t need the features of the Power Mac&quot;. Jobs&#x27;s minimalist aesthetic influenced the core components of the design, from the lack of a mechanical power button, to the trayless optical drive and quiet fanless operation. The design team at Apple, led by Jonathan Ive, shrunk a powerful desktop form factor, seeing traditional desktop tower computers as lazily designed around what was easiest for engineers. The Cube represented an internal shift in Apple, as the designers held increasing sway over product design. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the Cube &quot;pure [...] industrial design&quot; harkening to Bauhaus concepts.

The Cube represented an effort by Apple to simplify the computer to its barest essentials. Journalist Jason Snell called the machine an example of Jobs and Ive&#x27;s obsession with a &quot;Black Box&quot;—dense, miniaturized computers hidden within a pleasing shell hiding the &quot;magic&quot; of its technology. As the Cube has no fan, the design started with the heat sink. The power button that turned on with a wave or touch was accomplished via the use of capacitive sensing. The proprietary plastics formula for the housing took Apple six months to develop. Effort spent developing the Cube would pioneer new uses and processes for materials at Apple that benefitted later products. Because of the technology included in the Cube, Apple&#x27;s engineers had a tough time keeping the total cost low. Advertising director Ken Segall recalled that Jobs learned of the product&#x27;s price shortly before an ad agency meeting, and was left &quot;visibly shaken&quot; by the news, realizing that the high price might cause the product&#x27;s failure.

==Release and reception==
Rumors of a cube-shaped Apple computer leaked weeks in advance, and some sites posted purported pictures. The G4 Cube was announced at Macworld Expo on July 19, 2000, as an end-of-show &quot;one more thing&quot;. Jobs touted it as combining the power of the Power Mac G4 with a sleek design and miniaturization Apple learned from producing the iMac. Alongside the Cube, Apple introduced a new mouse, keyboard, and displays to complement the machine.

The machine&#x27;s size and looks were immediately divisive, which &quot;Macworld&quot; editor Andrew Gore took as an indication that Apple had succeeded in creating a cutting-edge product. The design was a point of praise and of jokes, compared to a Borg cube, toasters, or a box of Kleenex tissues. Others compared it to the NeXTcube. Ive and the design team were so amused by the comparison to a tissue box that they used spare Cube shells for that purpose in their studio.

Reviews were generally positive. Peter H. Lewis, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the computer the most attractive on the market, and that the machine, combined with Apple&#x27;s displays and peripherals, created &quot;desk sculpture&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine Australia&quot; said that after changing the look of computers with the iMac, the G4 Cube had raised the bar for competitors even further. Gore called the Cube a work of art that felt more like sculpture than a piece of technology, but noted that one had to live with compromises made in the service of art. Walt Mossberg, writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, called it the &quot;most gorgeous personal computer&quot; that he had ever seen.

Critics noted that to get easy access to plug and unplug peripherals, users must tip the entire machine—risking accidental sleep activation or dropping the smooth plastic computer entirely. &quot;Macworld&quot; found the touch-sensitive power button too sensitive and they accidentally activated sleep mode regularly. They reported that the stock 5400-rpm hard drive and 64 MB of RAM on the base model slowed the system considerably.

The Cube won several international design awards on release, and &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s best desktop computer for its Technical Innovation Awards. The G4 Cube and its peripherals were acquired and showcased by The Museum of Modern Art alongside other Apple products, and a Cube is also held in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History and Powerhouse Museum.

===Sales===
The introduction of the Cube did not fit with the focused product lineup Jobs had introduced since his return to Apple, leaving it without a clear audience. It was as expensive as a similarly equipped Power Mac, but without extra room for more storage or PCI slots. It was likewise much more expensive than an upgraded consumer iMac. Jobs imagined that creative professionals and designers would want one, and that the product was so great that it would inform buying patterns.

Sales for the Cube were much lower than expected. Returning from the brink of bankruptcy, Apple had eleven profitable quarters before the Cube&#x27;s announcement, but Apple&#x27;s end-of-year financials for 2000 missed predicted revenues by $180million. Part of the drop in profit was attributed to the Cube, with only one third as many units sold as Apple had expected, creating a $90million shortfall in revenue targets. The Cube counted for 29,000 of the Macs Apple shipped in the quarter, compared to 308,000 iMacs. Retailers had excess product, leaving Apple with a large amount of unsold inventory heading into 2001 it had expected to last until March. The computer appealed to high-end customers who wanted a small and sleek design, but Jobs admitted that audience was smaller than expected. In February 2001, Apple lowered the price on the 500 MHz model and added new memory, hard drive, and graphics options. These updates made little difference, and sales continued to decline. In the first quarter of 2001, only 12,000units were sold, representing just 1.6% of the company&#x27;s total computer sales.

In addition to the product&#x27;s high price, the Cube suffered cosmetic issues. Early buyers noticed cracks caused by the injection-molded plastic process. The idea of a design-focused product having aesthetic flaws turned into a negative public relations story for Apple, and dissuaded potential buyers for whom the design was its main appeal. The Cube&#x27;s radical departure from a conventional personal computer alienated potential buyers, and exacerbated Apple&#x27;s struggles in the market competing with the performance of Windows PCs. &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Benj Edwards wrote that consumers treated the Cube as &quot;an underpowered, over-expensive toy or [...] an emotionally inaccessible, ultra-geometric gray box suspended in an untouchable glass prison&quot;. The lack of internal expansion and reliance on less-common USB and FireWire peripherals also hurt the computer&#x27;s chances of success.

Jobs clearly loved the computer, but was quick to discontinue the underperforming product. On July 3, 2001, an Apple press release made the unusual statement that the computer—rather than being canceled or discontinued—was having its production &quot;suspended indefinitely&quot;, due to low demand. Apple did not rule out an upgraded Cube model in the future, but considered it unlikely. Business journalist Karen Blumenthal called the Cube the first big failure by Jobs since his return to Apple. Jobs&#x27;s ability to quickly move on the mistake left the Cube a &quot;blip&quot; in Apple&#x27;s history, according to Segall—a quickly forgotten failure among other successful innovations.

==Legacy==
Though Apple CEO Tim Cook called the Cube &quot;a spectacular failure&quot; and the product sold only 150,000 units before being discontinued, it became highly popular with a small but enthusiastic group of fans. &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Benj Edwards wrote that the Cube was a product ahead of its time; its appeal to a dedicated group of fans years after it was discontinued was a testament to its vision. After its discontinuation the product fetched high prices from resellers, and a cottage industry developed selling upgrades and modifications to make the machine run faster or cooler. John Gruber wrote 20 years after its introduction that the Cube was a &quot;worthy failure [...] Powerful computers needed to get smaller, quieter, and more attractive. The Cube pushed the state of the art forward.&quot; CNET called the machine &quot;an iconic example of millennium-era design&quot;. Its unconventional and futuristic appearance earned it a spot as a prop in several films and television shows, including &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, Orange County, and &quot;24&quot;. Sixteen Cubes were also used to power the displays of the computer consoles in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.

Although the Cube failed commercially, it influenced future Apple products. The efforts at miniaturizing computer components would benefit future computers like the flatscreen iMac G4, while the efforts Apple spent learning how to precision machine parts of the Cube would be integral to the design of aluminum MacBooks. The Mac mini fit an entire computer in a shell one-fifth the size of the Cube and retained some of the Cube&#x27;s design philosophies. In comparison to the high price of the Cube, the Mini retailed for $499 and became a successful product that remains part of Apple&#x27;s lineup. The translucent cube shape would return with the design for the flagship Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York City. Capacitive touch would reappear in the iPod and iPhone lines, and the Cube&#x27;s vertical thermal design and lattice grille pattern were echoed by the 2013 and 2019 versions of the Mac Pro.

<doc id="103792" wikidata="Q17090271" url="?curid=103792" title="Megahertz (record producer)">
<text>Dorsey Wesley, better known by his stage name Megahertz, is an American record producer, composer and songwriter.

&quot;Vibe Magazine&quot; dubbed Megahertz one of music&#x27;s &quot;10 Most Valuable Producers&quot;, while About.com ranked him on its list of the &quot;Top 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Producers&quot;.

Described by &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; as a &quot;Powerful Producer&quot;, Megahertz has enjoyed commercial success producing music for television, film, video games, mixtapes &amp; songs that have been certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum.

Associated with artists such as P. Diddy, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, R. Kelly, Busta Rhymes, Nas &amp; &quot;Saturday Night Live&#x27;s&quot; Robert Smigel – it has been said that Megahertz &quot;..brings the wattage.&quot;

== Early career ==
Megahertz is a native of Willingboro, New Jersey. He was raised in a &quot;Christian household that didn&#x27;t allow rap music.&quot; Trying to keep his passion hidden, he would get &quot;extra church time&quot; if his mom heard him rapping. Despite his rigid religious upbringing, Megahertz immersed himself in what his mother called &quot;evil music&quot;.

But as Megahertz admitted to &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;, &quot;Not being able to listen to music only made me want to hear it more.&quot; Tired of rapping over other people&#x27;s beats, Megahertz began to purchase his own equipment and secretly keep it at his friend&#x27;s house. Before long, producing music took precedence over rapping.

One of his first breakthrough hits was &quot;Bad Boy for Life&quot;. According to &quot;Vibe Magazine&quot;, &quot;...Megahertz&#x27;s bionic rubber-band beat for &#x27;Bad Boy for Life&#x27; put Diddy back in the winner&#x27;s circle.&quot; Grammy nominated and certified four times platinum, it was the second single from P. Diddy&#x27;s &quot;The Saga Continues&quot;, which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Mainstream Top 40. The &quot;Bad Boy for Life&quot; music video featured cameo&#x27;s by actor Ben Stiller, rock drummer Travis Barker, NBA star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and others.

== Commercial success ==
Described by &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; as a &quot;powerful producer&quot;, Megahertz has enjoyed commercial success producing music for television, film, video games, mixtapes &amp; songs that have been certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum.

Associated with artists such as P. Diddy, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, R. Kelly, Busta Rhymes, Nas &amp; &quot;Saturday Night Live&#x27;s&quot; Robert Smigel – it has been said that Megahertz &quot;..brings the wattage.&quot;

Megahertz made history when he produced &quot;Gotta Make It to Heaven&quot; for the fourth highest selling U.S. rap album of all-time, 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;. With over 12 million copies sold, it is on one of the best selling albums of the decade.

== Production style ==
Music writer Raqiyah Mays wrote, &quot;There&#x27;s power in Megahertz&#x27;s name: a million cycles per second, to be exact. And when you buy his beats it&#x27;s as if that power electrocutes whomever he&#x27;s working with, shocking them into accelerating their skills.&quot;

Megahertz&#x27;s genre-bending production style uses original composition, in combination with the occasional use of sampled sounds or songs, performed over programmed drums.

One such track was the Nas single &quot;Got Ur Self a Gun&quot;, which used &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; – the theme song from HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Referencing the music Megahertz created around that sample, MTV&#x27;s Shaheed Reid wrote, &quot;Megahertz molded pianos and strings that sound like they could&#x27;ve been played at the coronation ceremony for an 18th century king.&quot;

Another example of his knack for reinterpreting popular music occurred when Megahertz created a track for Tony Yayo&#x27;s debut album using a sample made popular by Britney Spears. In the words of one fan, &quot;&#x27;Love My Style&#x27; is probably one of the album&#x27;s craziest tracks as Megahertz flips the same sample used on Britney Spears&#x27;s &#x27;Toxic.&#x27; What was once sugar-sweet pop takes on a menacing and minister tone and Yayo takes full advantage as he attacks the beat with confidence.&quot;

Megahertz&#x27;s diverse production style, opened the door for collaborations with rock groups like P.O.D. &amp; Linkin Park. Attracted to unusual musical pairings, Megahertz told &quot;Source Magazine&quot;, &quot;I like System of a Down and I wouldn&#x27;t mind doing something with them...I&#x27;d work with Limp Bizkit and I&#x27;m a Björk fan. I&#x27;ll do Calypso. I&#x27;ll do some Indian music, whatever, just bring it on. I&#x27;ll do it.&quot;

Resolute that his music continue to evolve, Megahertz said, &quot;I&#x27;m not into repeat joints- I want to be re-discovered for new sounds each time.&quot;

==Performer==
As a performer Megahertz grew up rapping, a talent that blossomed into creating jingles, commercial spots and ultimately led to songwriting &amp; singing. In one such performance, Megahertz drops a cameo on the chorus of &quot;Superstar&quot;, a song that features Ice Cube, WC &amp; Mack 10.

== Controversy ==
One of the most high-profile feuds in American hip hop history was the rivalry between Jay-Z &amp; Nas. &quot;Vibe Magazine&quot; writer Dave Tompkins recounts, &quot;When Jigga&#x27;s (a.k.a. Jay-Z&#x27;s) publicized beef with Nas reached nasty proportions, everyone waited on a response from God&#x27;s Son (a.k.a. Nas). And he came out swinging with the Megahertz produced &quot;Got Ur Self A Gun&quot; – a killer cut laced with a violent harpsichord.&quot;

The track was the second single on Nas&#x27; &quot;Stillmatic&quot; album, and just days after its release, Jay-Z retaliated by putting out &quot;Supa Ugly&quot;, a combative freestyle, performed over &quot;Got Ur Self A Gun&quot; and Dr. Dre&#x27;s song &quot;Bad Intentions.&quot;

==Later years==
At the height of his production career, he suddenly disappeared from the music industry. According to Megahertz, the reason was due to the death of his father around the time of his success.

<text>Scouting in Pennsylvania has a long and rich tradition, from 1908 to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.
==History==

===Early history (1908–1950)===
One of the earliest Scouting groups in Pennsylvania began in 1908 in Pottsville, when a Superintendent with the Pennsylvania State Police, Lynn G. Adams, formed a troop using Baden-Powell&#x27;s handbook, &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;. The troop was made up of two patrols, one sponsored by the Pottsville Mission and the other by the YMCA. Adams became the first Scoutmaster in Pennsylvania in 1910 soon after the BSA was incorporated. The oldest Pennsylvania Scout troop still in existence is &quot;Troop Bala One&quot; in Bala Cynwyd, which was founded in 1908 by Frank H. Sykes.

The first council in Pennsylvania was the Delaware &amp; Montgomery County Council in 1911. This council eventually became the former Valley Forge Council, now part of the Cradle of Liberty Council.
Sixteen councils were chartered in America between 1910 and 1913. The seventeenth was the Warren County Council headquartered in Warren, Pennsylvania. This council later changed its name to Chief Cornplanter Council and is still in operation. It is currently the oldest existing, continuously registered council in America. The other preceding 16 councils either went out of business or merged with another council at some point in their history. The information for this paragraph was provided by the Registration Department of the National Office of the BSA, Irving, Texas, in October 2007.

Also in 1913, the Philadelphia Council opened the first American scout camp, Treasure Island Scout Reservation, near Point Pleasant. Two years later, Dr. E. Urner Goodman and Carrol Edson founded the Order of the Arrow, which inducted its first members on July 16, 1915 at Treasure Island.

In 1914, the Allegheny County Council, forerunner of today&#x27;s Laurel Highlands Council, was chartered. Also in 1914, the Philadelphia Council was chartered.

In 1915 charters were first granted to the councils headquartered in Erie, Wilkes-Barre, and Oil City.

In 1916, councils were chartered in Reading, Lancaster, Harrisburg, and Scranton, among others. The council in Harrisburg is now part of New Birth of Freedom Council.

In 1917 Meadville, State College and Bethlehem were granted charters by the National Office, along with nine other councils.

1919 saw the councils in Williamsport, Altoona and Chester County formed. Like Chief Cornplanter, the Chester County Council is still in operation, one of only a handful of small one-county councils left in America. The other one in Pennsylvania, Bucks County Council, received its first charter in 1927.

By 1920, forty-six councils had been chartered in Pennsylvania. Most of these were small councils no larger than the town they were named after. Some of these were known as &quot;Second Class Councils&quot;.

In the following years, other currently chartered councils were started: Juniata Valley in 1929; Bucktail in 1930; Columbia-Montour and Schuylkill County Area in 1931; and York-Adams in 1932.

1937 saw the formation of the current Westmoreland-Fayette Council in Greensburg.

All other current councils in Pennsylvania are the result of mergers which began to occur in the 1960s through the present day.

1941 saw the creation of Camp Ockanickon in Bucks County Council.

Among the claimants for &quot;First Boy Scout Troop in the United States&quot; is Troop 1 in Bala Cynwyd.

Pennsylvania is home to the oldest annual Scouting event in the nation, the Valley Forge Pilgrimage and Encampment.

In 1928, Eagle Scout (and Erie native) Paul Siple was one of the first Scouts to travel to Antarctica with Admiral Richard Byrd. Byrd had held a national contest to invite worthy Eagle Scouts onto the expedition. Paul Siple later went on to develop what is now known as the &quot;Wind Chill Factor&quot;

The 1921 and 1931 National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meetings were held at Philadelphia, the 1922 and 1927 National Lodge Meetings were held at Reading, and the 1940 National Lodge Meeting was held at Ligonier.

In 1924, the McKean County Council (#499) was formed, changing its name to the McKean-Potter Area Council (#499) in 1926. In 1936, the council changed its name to the McKean-Potter Area Council (#499) in 1936. In 1947, the council changed its name to the Elk Lick Council (#499).

===Recent history (1950–1990)===
The 1950 National Scout Jamboree was held at Valley Forge. That positive experience led to National Jamborees in 1957 and 1964 as well.

Outside of the few small councils mentioned above, the history of Pennsylvania councils over the past 50 years has been one of mergers.

Beginning in 1962, the Mid-Valley Council, headquartered in Peckville, merged with the former Dan Beard Council in Scranton to form the Forest Lakes Council. Meanwhile, in 1970, the former Anthracite Council (Hazleton) merged with the former Wyoming Valley Council (Wilkes-Barre) to form the Penn Mountains Council. In 1984, the area comprising the former Anthracite Council removed itself from the Penn Mountains Council and joined neighboring Minsi Trails Council. Forest Lakes Council and Penn Mountains Council merged in 1990 to form the current Northeastern Pennsylvania Council, in Moosic.

In 1967, the former Nemacolin Trails Council in Washington, Pennsylvania, merged with the Allegheny Council in Pittsburgh to become the Allegheny Trails Council. This council merged again in 1993 with East Valley Council to become the Greater Pittsburgh Council.

In 1969, the Lehigh County Council (Allentown), Bethlehem Area Council and Delaware Valley Area Council (Easton) merged to form the current Minsi Trails Council in Allentown.

In 1970, the former Appalachian Trail Council and Daniel Boone Council merged to form the current Hawk Mountain Council in Reading. 1970 also saw the merger of the Blair-Bedford Area Council (Altoona), William Penn Council (Indiana) and Admiral Robert E. Peary Council (Johnstown) into the Penns Woods Council in Ebensburg.

In 1971, the Lancaster County and Lebanon County councils merged to form the Lancaster-Lebanon Council. This council changed its name in 1995 to the Pennsylvania Dutch Council and is headquartered in Lancaster.

In 1972, the Washington Trail Council (Erie), Colonel Drake Council (Oil City) and Custaloga Council (Sharon) merged to form the current French Creek Council, headquartered in Erie.

1973 saw the merger of the former Lawrence County Council (New Castle) with the former Pioneer Trails Council (Butler), forming the current Moraine Trails Council, host to two National Jamborees (see below).

Also in 1973, the former Elk Lick Council, in Bradford, merged into the Allegheny Highlands Council headquartered in Falconer, New York.

In 1974, the former West Branch Council (Williamsport) and Susquehanna Valley Area Council (Sunbury) merged to form the current Susquehanna Council in Williamsport.

In 1973, the Allegheny Highlands Council (#382) was formed from a merger of the Seneca Council (#750) and the Elk Lick Council (#499).

Other notable happenings in Pennsylvania Scouting at this time include:

The 1950, 1957, and 1964 National Scout Jamborees were held at Valley Forge.

Half of the 1973 National Scout Jamboree (&quot;Jamboree East&quot;) was held at Moraine State Park in Butler County, where the 1977 National Scout Jamboree and Campaganza 2010 were also held.

During 1975 and 1976, Scouts in the Philadelphia area could earn a &quot;Colonial Philadelphia&quot; merit badge. It could only be counted towards palms, not any rank, and came in a green border and a very yellow-green border. This was the only time BSA National approved a regional merit badge for any such use.

==Boy Scouts of America in Pennsylvania Today==

===Bucktail Council===
The Bucktail Council of the Boy Scouts of America serves Cameron, Clearfield, Elk, Jefferson, and the western portions of Centre County. The Council was organized on July 24, 1930, and headquartered in DuBois. The Council adopted its constitution and by-laws on April 28, 1931, thanks to the efforts of John Q. Groves of Dubois. The Council brought under a unified leadership several independent Boy Scout troops in the surrounding areas of Brockway, Brookville, Clearfield, DuBois, Johnsonburg, Mahaffey, Philipsburg, Reynoldsville, Ridgway, and St. Marys.

The first Council President was Lyle G. Hall (1930 – 1938, 1971), the first Council Scout Executive was H. B. Knepper (1930 – 1937), and the first Council Commissioner was H. T. Gray.

The name of the Council references the 13th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment, also known as “Bucktails”, a volunteer infantry regiment that was part of the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War. When the regiment was first forming, one recruit —many of which were woodsmen and lumbermen— ornamented his hat with a tail from a White-tailed deer he had found in a butcher shop. Other men liked this decoration and adopted the practice, causing the regiment to be known as “Bucktails”.

District

Bucktail Council has a single District, PA Eastern Wilds, which covers the following school districts: Cameron County, St. Mary’s, Bald Eagle, Clearfield, Curwensville, Moshannon Valley, West Branch, Philipsburg-Osceola Area, Johnsonburg, Ridgway, Brockway, DuBois, Brookville, Clarion-Limestone, Punxsutawney.

====Camps====
*Camp Mountain Run
In 1931, the Council used Camp Coffman, the Oil City Scout Council&#x27;s Camp (now part of French Creek Council), for their first summer camp program. On May 1, 1932, the Bucktail Council Camp Committee reported two sites had been inspected for the location of the Council’s own camp. One was near East Branch Clarion River in Elk County and the second site near a beaver dam along Mountain Run Stream in Penfield, Clearfield County. The Council approved the leasing of the land on Mountain Run which would be developed into the 380+ acre present-day Camp Mountain Run Scout Camp.

The land was first leased from the Kersey Mining Company and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Later the Shawmut Mining Company, which acquired the Kersey Mining Company’s portion, sold its tract of land to the Council in 1939 for one dollar. In 1962, through the efforts of J. Hall Stackpole (Seventh President, 1957 - 1960), his company, the Stackpole Carbon Company arranged a trade of 614 acres for the 307 acres still owned by the Commonwealth which he deeded to the Council.

The Stackpole Carbon Company’s outstanding generosity continued by building and funding the original swimming pool in 1935 and supplied funding in 1960 for the renovation of its filtration system. In 1970, the Stackpole-Hall Foundation provided a large donation for the expansion and renovation of the Camp’s dining hall. 

====Order of the Arrow====
*Ah&#x27;Tic Lodge #139
In the Spring 1937, the leaders of Bucktail Council wanted to recognize those Scouts and Scouters who were “Honor Campers”, those who best exemplified the ideals of the Scout Oath and Law. The Council did so by organizing a Camp Honor Society. Shortly thereafter, the Council’s Executive Board in January 1938 voted to apply for an Order of the Arrow Lodge Charter. This effort, led by John H. Keller (Second Council Executive, 1937 - 1942), would form the Lodge’s charter membership from those members of the original Honor Camper Society. On June 1, 1938, a ceremonial team from Camp Twin Echo came to Camp Mountain Run to initiate those first members into the Order of the Arrow. The first official meeting of Ah’Tic Lodge was July 27, 1938, the name “Ah’Tic” taken from the Chippewa language meaning “Standing Elk”.

===Chester County Council===

In 1910, members of the community of Warren first explored Scouting activities. In 1913, the Boy Scouts of America gave a charter to an organization known as the Warren County Council. Then in 1954 the council&#x27;s official name was changed to Chief Cornplanter Council to honor the famous Seneca-Iroquois war chief and diplomat. In 2013, the council celebrated its 100th anniversary as the longest-tenured, unmerged Boy Scout Council in America.

<text>Francis Davis Millet (November 3, 1848 – April 15, 1912) was an American academic classical painter, sculptor, and writer who died in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; on April 15, 1912.

==Early life==
Francis Davis Millet was born in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts. Most sources give his date of birth as November 3, 1846, but a diary which he kept during his military service stated that November 3, 1864 was his 16th birthday, suggesting his year of birth was 1848. At age fifteen, Millet entered the 60th Massachusetts Infantry, first as a drummer and then a surgical assistant (helping his father, a surgeon) in the American Civil War.

He repeatedly pointed to his experience working for his father as giving him an appreciation for the vivid blood red that he frequently used in his early paintings. Millet graduated from Harvard with a Master of Arts degree. He worked as a reporter and editor for the &quot;Boston Courier&quot; and then as a correspondent for the &quot;Advertiser&quot; at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.

==Career==
In 1876, Millet returned to Boston to paint murals at Trinity Church in Boston with John LaFarge. He entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Antwerp, Belgium. He was the first student to win a silver medal in his first year; the following year he won a gold medal. In the Russo‐Turkish war of 1877–78, he was engaged as a war correspondent by the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, the London &quot;Daily News&quot;, and the London &quot;Graphic&quot;. He was decorated by Russia and Romania for his bravery under fire and his services to the wounded.

Millet became a member of the Society of American Artists in 1880, and in 1885 was elected as a member of the National Academy of Design, New York and as Vice-Chairman of the Fine Arts Committee. He was made a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and sat on the advisory committee of the National Gallery of Art. He was decorations director for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, with claims he invented the first form of compressed air spraypainting to apply whitewash to the buildings, but the story may be apocryphal as contemporary journals note spraypainting had already been in use since the early 1880s. His career included work on a number of worlds&#x27; fairs, including Vienna, Chicago, Paris, and Tokyo, where he made contributions as a juror, administrator, mural painter/decorator, and adviser.

Millet was among the founders of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and was influential in the early days of the American Federation of Arts. He was instrumental in obtaining the appointment of Emil Otto Grundmann, an old acquaintance from his Antwerp days, as first head of the school. Millet was involved with the American Academy in Rome from its inception and served as secretary from 1904 to 1911. He was a founding member and vice chairman of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, serving from 1910 until his death in 1912. He died aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot; while traveling to New York City on Academy business.

As well as an artist, Millet was a writer and journalist. He translated Tolstoy and also wrote essays and short stories. Among his publications are &quot;Capillary Crime and Other Stories&quot; (1892), &quot;The Danube From the Black Forest to the Black Sea&quot; (1892) and &quot;Expedition to the Philippines&quot; (1899). He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and was an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects.

A noted sculptor and designer, Millet designed the 1907 Civil War Medal at the request of the U.S. Army and United States War Department and the 1908 Spanish Campaign Medal. He executed the ceiling of the Call Room of the US Custom House at Baltimore, Maryland.

==Personal life==

Millet was close friends with Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Mark Twain, both of whom attended his 1879 wedding to Elizabeth (&quot;Lily&quot;) Greely Merrill in Paris, France; Twain was Millet&#x27;s best man. The couple had four children: Kate, Edwin, Laurence, and John.

Millet was acquainted with the famed American portraitist John Singer Sargent, who often used Millet&#x27;s daughter Kate as a model. He was also close to the esteemed Huxley family.

Millet lived with Archibald Butt, who called him &quot;my artist friend who lives with me,&quot; in a large mansion at 2000 G Street NW. They were known for throwing large but spartan parties that were attended by members of Congress, justices of the Supreme Court, and President Taft himself. There is some speculation that Butt and Millet were lovers. Historian Richard Davenport-Hines wrote in 2012:

== Death ==
On April 10, 1912, Millet boarded the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; at Cherbourg, France, bound for New York City. He was traveling with long-time friend Archibald Butt. Millet was last seen helping women and children into lifeboats. His body was recovered after the sinking by the cable boat &quot;Mackay-Bennett&quot; and returned to East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, where he was buried in Central Cemetery.

==Memorials==
In 1913, the Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain was erected in Washington, D.C., in memory of Millet and his long-time friend Archibald W. Butt, with whom he shared a home.

A bronze bust in Harvard University&#x27;s Widener Library also memorializes Millet.

In 2015, his murals were exhibited in Cleveland Ohio.

<doc id="103841" wikidata="Q2888060" url="?curid=103841" title="Iris Chacón">
<text>Iris Belia Chacón Tapia (born March 7, 1950) is a Puerto Rican dancer, singer, actress, and entertainer.

Known as &quot;La Bomba de Puerto Rico&quot; and &quot;La Vedette de América,&quot; Chacón was a prominent figure in Latin America, the United States, Europe, and Japan during the 1970s and early 1980s. She starred in films, telenovelas, and appeared in one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most famous TV commercials.

==Career==
Chacón has been known by various nicknames, such as &quot;La Bomba de Puerto Rico&quot; (The Puerto Rican Bombshell), and &quot;La Vedette de América&quot; (America&#x27;s Showgirl). During her heyday in the 1970s and early 1980s, she toured most of Latin America, the United States, Europe and Japan. She also starred in two movies and many telenovelas, such as &quot;Yo Sé Que Mentía&quot;.

===Amalie Oíl commercial===

In 1982, AMCAR, Inc. hired her for a television commercial about Amalie Oil Company automobile coolant products, which became one of the most famous television commercials in Puerto Rico&#x27;s history. The publicity surrounding the commercial landed her in a front-page article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in June 1983 entitled &quot;A Onetime Choirgirl Rules as Sex Goddess On Puerto Rican TV&quot;. The ad employed a play on words between the English word &quot;coolant&quot; and Spanish &quot;culón&quot;, which means large derrière (buttocks).

===Mid-1980s to present===
From 1984 through the early 1990s, Iris Chacón appeared on such American TV shows as &quot;America Onstage&quot;, &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;Geraldo Rivera Show&quot;, and &quot;David Letterman&quot;. Letterman described her as the Dolly Parton and Loni Anderson of Puerto Rico and joked about proposing to her. Griffin said of her that &quot;she was the answer to &#x27;Where&#x27;s the beef?&#x27;&quot;, a reference to the Wendy&#x27;s commercial of that time period. However, by 1984, Chacón reached her peak, and not being able to reach an &quot;Anglo&quot; market, ended her show in Puerto Rico by mid-1985 at the age of 35. Her show aired in syndication until the end of the 1980s.

Outside of the U.S., Chacón appeared on various Spanish-language programs, including &quot;Anabel&quot;, &quot;Siempre en Domingo,&quot; &quot;Mala Noche No&quot;, and &quot;Al Ritmo de la Noche&quot; which were all Televisa productions.

==Personal life==
Chacón has been married to Puerto Rican musician Junno Faria since 1977. They are the parents of a daughter, Katiria. Chacón divides her time between residences in Orlando and Puerto Rico.

==In popular culture==
George Pérez, co-creator of The New Teen Titans, along with writer Marv Wolfman, has cited Chacón as an inspiration (along with Red Sonja) for the creation of Starfire, as told by George himself during an interview to Vu Nguyen during the 2019 Amazing Las Vegas Comic Con.

In June 2023, Puerto Rican drag queen Jessica Wild impersonated Iris during the &quot;Snatch Game of Love&quot; challenge on the fifth episode of the eight season of the reality competition series RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars.

Iris is the subject of two songs written about her: &quot;Iris Chacon&quot; that appears on Buster Pointdexter&#x27;s (the alter ego of actor/singer David Johansen) 1997 album &quot;Buster&#x27;s Spanish Rocketship&quot; and &quot;Iris Chacon&quot; a Latin trap single released by Puerto Rican rapper Jon Z in 2020.

The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced objects. One of its aims is to use images of &quot;popular&quot; culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists&#x27; use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.

Amongst the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Ray Johnson, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of abstract expressionism, as well as an expansion of those ideas. Due to its utilization of found objects and images, it is similar to Dada. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art, or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.

Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Soup Cans&quot;, by Andy Warhol. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Tomato Juice Box&quot;, 1964 (pictured).

==Origins==

The origins of pop art in North America developed differently from those in Great Britain. In the United States, pop art was a response by artists; it marked a return to hard-edged composition and representational art. They used impersonal, mundane reality, irony, and parody to &quot;defuse&quot; the personal symbolism and &quot;painterly looseness&quot; of abstract expressionism. In the U.S., some artwork by Larry Rivers, Alex Katz and Man Ray anticipated pop art.

By contrast, the origins of pop art in post-war Britain, while employing irony and parody, were more academic. British artists focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American pop culture as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society. Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by American popular culture &quot;when viewed from afar&quot;. Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of Dadaism. While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture. Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and Kurt Schwitters.

===Proto-pop===
Although both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, Marcel Duchamp and others in Europe like Francis Picabia and Man Ray predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American &quot;proto-pop&quot; origins which utilized &quot;as found&quot; cultural objects. During the 1920s, American artists Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy, Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis created paintings that contained pop culture imagery (mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design), almost &quot;prefiguring&quot; the pop art movement.

==United Kingdom: the Independent Group==
The Independent Group (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement. They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging prevailing modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of fine art. Their group discussions centered on pop culture implications from elements such as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology. At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi presented a lecture using a series of collages titled &quot;Bunk!&quot; that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947 and 1949. This material of &quot;found objects&quot; such as advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics mostly represented &quot;American&quot; popular culture. One of the collages in that presentation was Paolozzi&#x27;s &quot;I was a Rich Man&#x27;s Plaything&quot; (1947), which includes the first use of the word &quot;pop&quot;, appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver. Following Paolozzi&#x27;s seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused primarily on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.

According to the son of John McHale, the term &quot;pop art&quot; was first coined by his father in 1954 in conversation with Frank Cordell, although other sources credit its origin to British critic Lawrence Alloway. (Both versions agree that the term was used in Independent Group discussions by mid-1955.)

&quot;Pop art&quot; as a moniker was then used in discussions by IG members in the Second Session of the IG in 1955, and the specific term &quot;pop art&quot; first appeared in published print in the article &quot;But Today We Collect Ads&quot; by IG members Alison and Peter Smithson in Ark magazine in 1956. However, the term is often credited to British art critic/curator Lawrence Alloway for his 1958 essay titled &quot;The Arts and the Mass Media&quot;, even though the precise language he uses is &quot;popular mass culture&quot;. &quot;Furthermore, what I meant by it then is not what it means now. I used the term, and also &#x27;Pop Culture&#x27; to refer to the products of the mass media, not to works of art that draw upon popular culture. In any case, sometime between the winter of 1954–55 and 1957 the phrase acquired currency in conversation...&quot; Nevertheless, Alloway was one of the leading critics to defend the inclusion of the imagery of mass culture in the fine arts. Alloway clarified these terms in 1966, at which time pop art had already transited from art schools and small galleries to a major force in the artworld. But its success had not been in England. Practically simultaneously, and independently, New York City had become the hotbed for pop art.

In London, the annual Royal Society of British Artists (RBA) exhibition of young talent in 1960 first showed American pop influences. In January 1961, the most famous RBA-&quot;Young Contemporaries&quot; of all put David Hockney, the American R B Kitaj, New Zealander Billy Apple, Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Joe Tilson, Patrick Caulfield, Peter Phillips, Pauline Boty and Peter Blake on the map; Apple designed the posters and invitations for both the 1961 and 1962 Young Contemporaries exhibitions. Hockney, Kitaj and Blake went on to win prizes at the John-Moores-Exhibition in Liverpool in the same year. Apple and Hockney traveled together to New York during the Royal College&#x27;s 1961 summer break, which is when Apple first made contact with Andy Warhol – both later moved to the United States and Apple became involved with the New York pop art scene.

==United States==
Although pop art began in the early 1950s, in America it was given its greatest impetus during the 1960s. The term &quot;pop art&quot; was officially introduced in December 1962; the occasion was a &quot;Symposium on Pop Art&quot; organized by the Museum of Modern Art. By this time, American advertising had adopted many elements of modern art and functioned at a very sophisticated level. Consequently, American artists had to search deeper for dramatic styles that would distance art from the well-designed and clever commercial materials. As the British viewed American popular culture imagery from a somewhat removed perspective, their views were often instilled with romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones. By contrast, American artists, bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, produced work that was generally more bold and aggressive.
According to historian, curator and critic Henry Geldzahler, &quot;Ray Johnson&#x27;s collages &quot;Elvis Presley No. 1&quot; and &quot;James Dean&quot; stand as the Plymouth Rock of the Pop movement.&quot; Author Lucy Lippard wrote that &quot;The Elvis ... and Marilyn Monroe [collages] ... heralded Warholian Pop.&quot; Johnson worked as a graphic designer, met Andy Warhol by 1956 and both designed several book covers for New Directions and other publishers. Johnson began mailing out whimsical flyers advertising his design services printed via offset lithography. He later became known as the father of mail art as the founder of his &quot;New York Correspondence School,&quot; working small by stuffing clippings and drawings into envelopes rather than working larger like his contemporaries. A note about the cover image in January 1958&#x27;s &quot;Art News&quot; pointed out that &quot;[Jasper] Johns&#x27; first one-man show ... places him with such better-known colleagues as Rauschenberg, Twombly, Kaprow and Ray Johnson&quot;.

Indeed, two other important artists in the establishment of America&#x27;s pop art vocabulary were the painters Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg, who like Ray Johnson attended Black Mountain College in North Carolina after World War II, was influenced by the earlier work of Kurt Schwitters and other Dada artists, and his belief that &quot;painting relates to both art and life&quot; challenged the dominant modernist perspective of his time. His use of discarded readymade objects (in his Combines) and pop culture imagery (in his silkscreen paintings) connected his works to topical events in everyday America. The silkscreen paintings of 1962–64 combined expressive brushwork with silkscreened magazine clippings from &quot;Life, Newsweek,&quot; and &quot;National Geographic.&quot; Johns&#x27; paintings of flags, targets, numbers, and maps of the U.S. as well three-dimensional depictions of ale cans drew attention to questions of representation in art. Johns&#x27; and Rauschenberg&#x27;s work of the 1950s is frequently referred to as Neo-Dada, and is visually distinct from the prototypical American pop art which exploded in the early 1960s.

Roy Lichtenstein is of equal importance to American pop art. His work, and its use of parody, probably defines the basic premise of pop art better than any other. Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint in his best known works, such as &quot;Drowning Girl&quot; (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Secret Hearts&quot; #83. (&quot;Drowning Girl&quot; is part of the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.) His work features thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein said, &quot;[abstract expressionists] put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don&#x27;t come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock&#x27;s or Kline&#x27;s.&quot; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery/content into the mix.

The paintings of Lichtenstein, like those of Andy Warhol, Tom Wesselmann and others, share a direct attachment to the commonplace image of American popular culture, but also treat the subject in an impersonal manner clearly illustrating the idealization of mass production.

Andy Warhol is probably the most famous figure in pop art. In fact, art critic Arthur Danto once called Warhol &quot;the nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced&quot;. Warhol attempted to take pop beyond an artistic style to a life style, and his work often displays a lack of human affectation that dispenses with the irony and parody of many of his peers.

===Early U.S. exhibitions===

Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine and Tom Wesselmann had their first shows in the Judson Gallery in 1959 and 1960 and later in 1960 through 1964 along with James Rosenquist, George Segal and others at the Green Gallery on 57th Street in Manhattan. In 1960, Martha Jackson showed installations and assemblages, &quot;New Media – New Forms&quot; featured Hans Arp, Kurt Schwitters, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Jim Dine and May Wilson. 1961 was the year of Martha Jackson&#x27;s spring show, &quot;Environments, Situations, Spaces&quot;. Andy Warhol held his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in July 1962 at Irving Blum&#x27;s Ferus Gallery, where he showed 32 paintings of Campell&#x27;s soup cans, one for every flavor. Warhol sold the set of paintings to Blum for $1,000; in 1996, when the Museum of Modern Art acquired it, the set was valued at $15 million.

Donald Factor, the son of Max Factor Jr., and an art collector and co-editor of avant-garde literary magazine &quot;Nomad&quot;, wrote an essay in the magazine&#x27;s last issue, &quot;Nomad/New York&quot;. The essay was one of the first on what would become known as pop art, though Factor did not use the term. The essay, &quot;Four Artists&quot;, focused on Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg.

In the 1960s, Oldenburg, who became associated with the pop art movement, created many &quot;happenings&quot;, which were performance art-related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was &quot;Ray Gun Theater&quot;. The cast of colleagues in his performances included: artists Lucas Samaras, Tom Wesselmann, Carolee Schneemann, Öyvind Fahlström and Richard Artschwager; dealer Annina Nosei; art critic Barbara Rose; and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer. His first wife, Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with &quot;profound&quot; expressions or ideas. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side to house &quot;The Store&quot;, a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods.

Opening in 1962, Willem de Kooning&#x27;s New York art dealer, the Sidney Janis Gallery, organized the groundbreaking &quot;International Exhibition of the New Realists&quot;, a survey of new-to-the-scene American, French, Swiss, Italian &quot;New Realism&quot;, and British pop art. The fifty-four artists shown included Richard Lindner, Wayne Thiebaud, Roy Lichtenstein (and his painting Blam), Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, Tom Wesselmann, George Segal, Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (&quot;The Love Wall&quot; from 1961), Öyvind Fahlström, Yves Klein, Arman, Daniel Spoerri, Christo and Mimmo Rotella. The show was seen by Europeans Martial Raysse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely in New York, who were stunned by the size and look of the American artwork. Also shown were Marisol, Mario Schifano, Enrico Baj and Öyvind Fahlström. Janis lost some of his abstract expressionist artists when Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and Philip Guston quit the gallery, but gained Dine, Oldenburg, Segal and Wesselmann. At an opening-night soiree thrown by collector Burton Tremaine, Willem de Kooning appeared and was turned away by Tremaine, who ironically owned a number of de Kooning&#x27;s works. Rosenquist recalled: &quot;at that moment I thought, something in the art world has definitely changed&quot;. Turning away a respected abstract artist proved that, as early as 1962, the pop art movement had begun to dominate art culture in New York.

A bit earlier, on the West Coast, Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine and Andy Warhol from New York City; Phillip Hefferton and Robert Dowd from Detroit; Edward Ruscha and Joe Goode from Oklahoma City; and Wayne Thiebaud from California were included in the &quot;New Painting of Common Objects&quot; show. This first pop art museum exhibition in America was curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum. Pop art was ready to change the art world. New York followed Pasadena in 1963, when the Guggenheim Museum exhibited &quot;Six Painters and the Object&quot;, curated by Lawrence Alloway. The artists were Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol. Another pivotal early exhibition was &quot;The American Supermarket&quot; organised by the Bianchini Gallery in 1964. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, including Apple, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Oldenburg, and Johns. This project was recreated in 2002 as part of the Tate Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture&quot;.

By 1962, pop artists started exhibiting in commercial galleries in New York and Los Angeles; for some, it was their first commercial one-man show. The Ferus Gallery presented Andy Warhol in Los Angeles (and Ed Ruscha in 1963). In New York, the Green Gallery showed Rosenquist, Segal, Oldenburg, and Wesselmann. The Stable Gallery showed R. Indiana and Warhol (in his first New York show). The Leo Castelli Gallery presented Rauschenberg, Johns, and Lichtenstein. Martha Jackson showed Jim Dine and Allen Stone showed Wayne Thiebaud. By 1966, after the Green Gallery and the Ferus Gallery closed, the Leo Castelli Gallery represented Rosenquist, Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and Ruscha. The Sidney Janis Gallery represented Oldenburg, Segal, Dine, Wesselmann and Marisol, while Allen Stone continued to represent Thiebaud, and Martha Jackson continued representing Robert Indiana.

In 1968, the &quot;São Paulo 9 Exhibition – Environment U.S.A.: 1957–1967&quot; featured the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; of pop art. Considered as a summation of the &quot;classical phase&quot; of the American pop art period, the exhibit was curated by William Seitz. The artists were Edward Hopper, James Gill, Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol and Tom Wesselmann.

==France==

&quot;Nouveau réalisme&quot; refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic Pierre Restany and the artist Yves Klein during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the &quot;Constitutive Declaration of New Realism,&quot; in April 1960, proclaiming, &quot;Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real.&quot; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein&#x27;s workshop, by nine people: Yves Klein, Arman, Martial Raysse, Pierre Restany, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and the Ultra-Lettrists, Francois Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Jacques de la Villeglé; in 1961 these were joined by César, Mimmo Rotella, then Niki de Saint Phalle and Gérard Deschamps. The artist Christo showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.

Contemporary of American pop art—often conceived as its transposition in France—new realism was along with Fluxus and other groups one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose Nice, on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the movement. In spite of the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct appropriation of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Restany; to a &quot;poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality&quot;.

==Spain==
In Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the &quot;new figurative&quot;, which arose from the roots of the crisis of informalism. Eduardo Arroyo could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both mass media communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of &quot;pop&quot; art is Alfredo Alcaín, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions.

Also in the category of Spanish pop art is the &quot;Chronicle Team&quot; (&quot;El Equipo Crónica&quot;), which existed in Valencia between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists Manolo Valdés and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as &quot;pop&quot; because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. Filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar emerged from Madrid&#x27;s &quot;La Movida&quot; subculture of the 1970s making low budget super 8 pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book &quot;Almodovar on Almodovar&quot;, he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film &quot;Funny Face&quot; was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar&#x27;s films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene.

== New Zealand ==

In New Zealand, pop art has predominately flourished since the 1990s, and is often connected to Kiwiana. Kiwiana is a pop-centered, idealised representation of classically Kiwi icons, such as meat pies, kiwifruit, tractors, jandals, Four Square supermarkets; the inherent campness of this is often subverted to signify cultural messages. Dick Frizzell is a famous New Zealand pop artist, known for using older Kiwiana symbols in ways that parody modern culture. For example, Frizzell enjoys imitating the work of foreign artists, giving their works a unique New Zealand view or influence. This is done to show New Zealand&#x27;s historically subdued impact on the world; naive art is connected to Aotearoan pop art this way.

This can be also done in an abrasive and deadpan way, as with Michel Tuffrey&#x27;s famous work &quot;Pisupo Lua Afe (Corned Beef 2000).&quot; Of Samoan ancestry, Tuffery constructed the work, which represents a bull, out of processed food cans known as &quot;pisupo&quot;. It is a unique work of western pop art because Tuffrey includes themes of neocolonialism and racism against non-western cultures (signified by the food cans the work is made of, which represent economic dependence brought on Samoans by the west). The undeniable indigenous viewpoint makes it stand out against more common non-indigenous works of pop art.

One of New Zealand&#x27;s earliest and famous pop artists is Billy Apple, one of the few non-British members of the Royal Society of British Artists. Featured among the likes of David Hockney, American R.B. Kitaj and Peter Blake in the January 1961 RBA exhibition &quot;Young Contemporaries&quot;, Apple quickly became an iconic international artist of the 1960s. This was before he conceived his moniker of &quot;Billy Apple&quot;, and his work was displayed under his birth name of Barrie Bates. He sought to distinguish himself by appearance as well as name, so bleached his hair and eyebrows with Lady Clairol Instant Creme Whip. Later, Apple was associated with the 1970s Conceptual Art movement.

==Japan==
In Japan, pop art evolved from the nation&#x27;s prominent avant-garde scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by Harue Koga in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art. The Japanese Gutai movement led to a 1958 Gutai exhibition at Martha Jackson&#x27;s New York gallery that preceded by two years her famous New Forms New Media show that put pop art on the map. The work of Yayoi Kusama contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol. In the mid-1960s, graphic designer Tadanori Yokoo became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from The Beatles, Marilyn Monroe, and Elizabeth Taylor, among others. Another leading pop artist at that time was Keiichi Tanaami. Iconic characters from Japanese manga and anime have also become symbols for pop art, such as Speed Racer and Astro Boy. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as Takashi Murakami and his superflat movement.

==Italy==

In Italy, by 1964 pop art was known and took different forms, such as the &quot;Scuola di Piazza del Popolo&quot; in Rome, with pop artists such as Mario Schifano, Franco Angeli, Giosetta Fioroni, Tano Festa, Claudio Cintoli, and some artworks by Piero Manzoni, Lucio Del Pezzo, Mimmo Rotella and Valerio Adami.

Italian pop art originated in 1950s culture – the works of the artists Enrico Baj and Mimmo Rotella to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958–1959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a &quot;non-representational genre&quot;, despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella&#x27;s torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj&#x27;s compositions were steeped in contemporary &quot;kitsch&quot;, which turned out to be a &quot;gold mine&quot; of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists.

The novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside &quot;domestic walls&quot; and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the &quot;new world&quot;, everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including Gianni Ruffi, Roberto Barni, Silvio Pasotti, Umberto Bignardi, and Claudio Cintoli, who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of &quot;let me have fun&quot; à la Aldo Palazzeschi.
==Belgium==
In Belgium, pop art was represented to some extent by Paul Van Hoeydonck, whose sculpture &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; was left on the Moon during one of the Apollo missions, as well as by other notable pop artists. Internationally recognized artists such as Marcel Broodthaers (&quot; &#x27;vous êtes doll? &quot;&quot;), Evelyne Axell and Panamarenko are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers&#x27;s great influence was George Segal. Another well-known artist, Roger Raveel, mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of some of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the Vietnam War&#x27;s increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day. Evelyne Axell from Namur was a prolific pop-artist in the 1964–1972 period. Axell was one of the first female pop artists, had been mentored by Magritte and her best-known painting is &quot;Ice Cream&quot;.

==Netherlands==
While there was no formal pop art movement in the Netherlands, there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include Daan van Golden, Gustave Asselbergs, Jacques Frenken, Jan Cremer, Wim T. Schippers, and Woody van Amen. They opposed the Dutch petit bourgeois mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include &quot;Sex O&#x27;Clock,&quot; by Woody van Amen, and &quot;Crucifix / Target&quot;, by Jacques Frenken.

==Russia==

Russia was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s, when Russia was a communist country and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia&#x27;s own version of pop art was Soviet-themed and was referred to as &quot;Sots Art&quot;. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power, and with it came a freedom to express. Pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by Dmitri Vrubel with his painting titled &quot;My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love&quot; in 1990. It might be argued that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.

<doc id="103899" wikidata="Q20858466" url="?curid=103899" title="Father Ted Crilly">
<text>Father Ted Crilly is the eponymous main character of the British Channel 4 situation comedy &quot;Father Ted&quot;. Created by Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews, Ted was portrayed by comedian Dermot Morgan for the programme&#x27;s three series. The character is a morally dubious Roman Catholic priest exiled to Craggy Island, a small island off the coast of Galway in Ireland.

The character was originally created by Mathews for a short-lived stand-up routine in the late 1980s. In 1994, Linehan and Mathews cast Morgan in the role for the television series, developing the character to match his abilities. Morgan&#x27;s performance was acclaimed; after his untimely death on 28 February 1998 from a heart attack, he was awarded a posthumous BAFTA for his work in the third series.

==Concept and creation==
Arthur Mathews had a lifelong fascination with priests, and developed the character of Father Ted while working at &quot;Hot Press&quot; with Graham Linehan and Paul Woodfull in 1987–89. After considering several surnames, Linehan suggested Crilly, which stuck. Mathews has described his version of Ted as a generic priest, but Woodfull saw the character as more camp, and later said that he felt Mathews had preempted the camp/gay priest stereotype in Irish comedy.

During production weekends, Mathews and Woodfull had the idea for The Joshua Trio, a comedic U2 tribute band. The band performed various warm-up sketches written by Mathews, Woodfull and Linehan, who joined in a non-musical capacity. This led to a side-project, a short-lived sketch troupe called The Fun Bunch. Deciding to base a sketch around Mathews&#x27;s Father Ted character, the group brainstormed for a surname in Linehan&#x27;s Castleknock kitchen; Linehan suggested Crilly, which stuck immediately. Mathews debuted his character on-stage at a comedy night in the Project Arts Centre. The character was received better than Woodfull&#x27;s own working-class Dublin priest, and Mathews later appeared as Father Ted in warm-up sketches for The Joshua Trio and Woodfull&#x27;s other musical act, Tony St James and The Las Vegas Sound. As Ted, Mathews sometimes read from a book, &quot;Notes from Africa&quot;, purportedly written by Father Dougal McGuire, a missionary friend who described his experiences of being attacked and chased by natives. In one sketch, Ted discussed his concern for Dougal, who had been voted Most Unpopular Priest in Africa for two years running and was spending Christmas up a tree in the grounds of The Bob Geldof Centre. During one Tony St James Olympia gig, audience members shouted &quot;Not a fucking priest!&quot;, but were pleased when Ted produced a portable confessional and proceeded to talk about it. On one occasion at The Purty Loft in Dún Laoghaire, he sang &quot;We Don&#x27;t Have to Take Our Clothes Off&quot;.

Later, Mathews and Woodfull included the character in &quot;The Starship Róisín&quot;, a short-lived science fiction comedy radio series they wrote for &quot;The Ian Dempsey Show&quot; on RTÉ Radio. An Irish parody of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, it followed the adventures of Captain Bono (played by Woodfull, based on the singer Bono) and his Vulcan sidekick Stephen &quot;Spock&quot; Roche (played by Mathews, based on cyclist Stephen Roche, with a &quot;cold, cycling brain&quot;. Storylines involved &quot;space bicycles&quot;, the ship chef Darina Alien (based on Darina Allen), emcee Tony St James (Woodfull), Johnny Guitar (a &quot;little fella&quot; who made guitar sounds), and ship chaplain Father Ted (Mathews). Woodfull later said that the show was &quot;probably a bit too weird for [its] slot&quot;, and that, when the station suggested they take two of the characters and launch a spin-off called &quot;Tea and Toast with Tony and Ted&quot;, Mathews opted out.

In 1989, Ted (played by Mathews) performed with The Joshua Trio in an episode of the Irish music anthology series &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, marking the character&#x27;s first televised appearance.

In 1990, Linehan and Mathews began writing &quot;Irish Lives&quot;, a six-part comedy television series. The show would have taken the form of a mockumentary, with each episode focusing on interviewing a different character; one of the six characters was Father Ted Crilly. The script, delivered in 1990, described Ted as &quot;a perpetually jolly and rather sad man who, through some terrible accident of faith, has found himself in the priesthood.&quot; The story involved Ted returning to his seminary to catch up with his old friends, including Father Jack, whom he fails to realise has recently died. Producer Geoffrey Perkins asked Linehan and Mathews to discard the mockumentary format and expand the Father Ted episode to a traditional sitcom.

Linehan found the character of Ted easier to write if he imagined Mathews&#x27;s version delivering the lines. &quot;Every time I wrote Ted in the early days, I&#x27;d hear Arthur&#x27;s voice... Ted was this very bland character who&#x27;d never curse except for saying a very quiet &#x27;feck&#x27; to himself. That panic and turmoil under the surface defined Ted before we even started writing him. Years later, when we did, it was just like pressing &#x27;play&#x27; on a tape recorder.&quot;

One of the writers&#x27; key influences was Charles Grodin&#x27;s character in the 1972 film &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;.

==Casting==
Actor Maurice O&#x27;Donoghue auditioned for the role, and Linehan felt that he was the right appearance, age and &quot;lightness&quot; for the character. Mathews wanted to cast comedian Dermot Morgan from an early stage, but Linehan was reluctant; he worried that audiences would confuse Ted with Father Trendy, a character Morgan had previously created for &quot;The Live Mike&quot;. Trendy parodied a class of priests including Brian D&#x27;Arcy, perceived in the 1970s as wanting to be considered liberal and &quot;cool&quot;, whereas Ted was written as a more conservative, traditional priest. Morgan lobbied hard for the role, eventually persuading Linehan. The writers considered O&#x27;Donoghue a back-up to use should Morgan become unavailable, and later created Father Dick Byrne, Ted&#x27;s recurring rival, specifically for O&#x27;Donoghue to play.

Aspects such as Ted&#x27;s obsession with money and fantasy of going to Las Vegas emerged while writing for Morgan, and the writers began to feel for Ted in a way they did not for the other characters.

After the second series aired, Linehan said he still believed that Mathews could easily have played Ted in the show.

There have been several attempts to remake the show for American audiences. In 2004, Steve Martin was reported to have signed on to play Ted in a new version. In 2007, John Michael Higgins was cast in the part.

==Fictional character biography==
Considered his family&#x27;s &quot;idiot brother&quot;, Ted was sent off to the priesthood while his brother, the favourite son, became a doctor, as was the custom at the time. Ted attended Saint Colm&#x27;s seminary, and was bullied by the other novices, who nicknamed him Father Fluffybottom after seeing his backside in the showers. Some time after being ordained, he was stationed in a Wexford parish, where he was investigated under suspicion of stealing the money for a child&#x27;s pilgrimage to Lourdes to fund his own trip to Las Vegas. Despite escaping formal charges and his insistence the money was &quot;just resting in his account&quot;, Bishop Brennan still banished Ted to the remote, cold, rainy Craggy Island, telling him that he would stay there until all of the money was accounted for. Ted was unsuccessful in this regard, as in the first series he mentions having lived on the island for over six years. He was eventually promoted and managed to move to a comfortable parish in Dublin, though his stay there was abruptly ended after irregularities in his expenses claims were discovered, and he was promptly sent straight back to Craggy Island.

For the duration of the show, Ted lives in the Craggy Island Parochial House with the childlike and dimwitted Father Dougal McGuire, the senile, aggressive and alcoholic Father Jack Hackett, and their neurotic housekeeper, Mrs Doyle (whom Linehan states Ted first met when she won the local Lovely Girls competition). He has a bitter rivalry with Father Dick Byrne, a priest living on the nearby Rugged Island. Ted&#x27;s experiences throughout the show range from the mundane (having to protest against a blasphemous film in &quot;The Passion of Saint Tibulus&quot; and rigging a raffle to repair the roof in &quot;Think Fast, Father Ted&quot;), to the surreal (becoming Ireland&#x27;s entry for Eurosong 1996 in &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;, and climbing out of a flying plane to fix the fuel line in &quot;Flight Into Terror&quot;). In &quot;A Christmassy Ted&quot;, Ted prevents a national scandal by helping seven other priests find their way out of Ireland&#x27;s largest department store lingerie section. The Church honours him with the Golden Cleric award.

Fathers Ted and Dougal then host the 1997 Comic Relief telethon (with Morgan and O&#x27;Hanlon in character for the duration of the event); when Ted wonders why he has been selected, Dougal suggests that God has planned it to allow Ted a chance to earn forgiveness for his sins by raising money for the charity.

In the next episode, the first of series three, &quot;Are You Right There Father Ted?&quot;, Ted has been transferred to an idyllic parish in Castlelawn, Dublin, but is soon sent back to Craggy Island when irregularities are discovered in his expenses. He later discovers the hard way that there is a Chinatown on Craggy Island and then has to go to great lengths to disprove rumours that he is a racist.

In the final episode, &quot;Going to America&quot;, Ted persuades the suicidal Father Kevin not to jump off a ledge at the &quot;It&#x27;s Great Being a Priest! &#x27;98&quot; conference. Impressed, an American priest offers Ted a place at his Los Angeles parish. Ted, unable to tell the others that they cannot come with him, is wracked with guilt; he cancels the move at the last minute after discovering Los Angeles&#x27; gang problem, then tells them that he has realised he belongs on Craggy Island. Dougal says that they will live together on the island forever, and a montage of clips from all previous episodes is shown before the episode ends.

The episode originally ended by flashing forward a year to the next conference. Ted sees Father Kevin standing on the ledge again; instead of helping, he joins him on the ledge, preparing to jump himself. The scene was cut and replaced with the montage following Morgan&#x27;s death and poor reaction from audiences. Mathews later noted that the original ending still left Ted&#x27;s fate ambiguous, and would have suggested the possibility of future episodes. Linehan stated: &quot;It&#x27;s nice to think of them all in the house having adventures, but when you think about it, it&#x27;s really cruel to Ted. It&#x27;s just an awful future for him... he&#x27;s not watching a sitcom, he&#x27;s living this awful life.&quot;

==Personality==
&quot;The Independent&quot; characterised Ted as &quot;by turns devious, cunning and disingenuous&quot;, noting a running joke about parish funds being traced to Ted&#x27;s personal account. Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon, who played Father Dougal, said that Ted was the show&#x27;s only rounded, fully formed character, and that the rest of the cast were essentially playing caricatures. Ted is frequently portrayed as a natural leader, albeit within the context of the priesthood.

In a 1997 interview, Morgan attributed the show&#x27;s success to the appealing double-act formed by Dougal, &quot;an idiot who knows nothing&quot;, and Ted, &quot;an idiot who thinks he knows something but actually knows nothing.&quot; The actor identified Ted as &quot;an Everyman guy, bumbling through life with a half-wit&quot;.

Linehan and Mathews have described Ted as a decent man, albeit one with &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;earthly&quot; ambitions; they note that he would hate to become a bishop or cardinal. Ted does not want to be seen as a priest, but is still willing to flash his collar and ask for free entry at the cinema. The writers also agree that Ted is the character most like them. Mathews grew up surrounded by priests (including his own uncle), and it was from these priests that Mathews drew Ted&#x27;s &quot;voice&quot;. Linehan is often asked about potential &quot;Father Ted&quot; spin-offs, but believes that Ted himself is the only character complex enough to survive outside the &quot;Father Ted&quot; environment. Mathews has suggested that Ted could even have worked well in a spin-off drama series.

The writers agree that Ted should be married to Polly Clarke (played by Gemma Craven), the novelist he becomes infatuated with in &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;, and consider the impossibility of their relationship &quot;terribly sad&quot;.

==Appearance==
Ted is a middle-aged man with a distinctive head of silver-grey hair (often imitated through wigs by cosplaying fans). He wears two badges: one is a pin signifying membership of the Pioneers, an Irish Catholic teetotalers organisation, and the other is a Fáinne, which indicates the wearer&#x27;s fluency in the Irish language.

==Reception and legacy==
In 1996, Morgan was named the Best TV Comedy Actor at the British Comedy Awards for his performance in the second series. He died in February 1998, one day after the third series of &quot;Father Ted&quot; completed recording, and was posthumously given the Award for Best Comedy Performance at the British Academy Television Awards 1999.

In November 2014, the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; named Ted the greatest Irish TV character, calling him &quot;a rare example of a straight man providing almost as many chuckles as his compatriots&quot; and praising his characterisation as an &quot;upstanding-yet-oh-so-faintly-slippery man of the cloth&quot; as true to life for many rural Irish viewers.

<text>An emergency position-indicating radiobeacon (EPIRB) is a type of emergency locator beacon for commercial and recreational boats, a portable, battery-powered radio transmitter used in emergencies to locate boaters in distress and in need of immediate rescue. In the event of an emergency, such as a ship sinking or medical emergency onboard, the transmitter is activated and begins transmitting a continuous 406 MHz distress radio signal, which is used by search-and-rescue teams to quickly locate the emergency and render aid. The signal is detected by satellites operated by an international consortium of rescue services, COSPAS-SARSAT, which can detect emergency beacons anywhere on Earth transmitting on the distress frequency of 406 MHz. The satellites calculate the position or utilize the GPS coordinates of the beacon and quickly passes the information to the appropriate local first responder organization, which performs the search and rescue. As Search and Rescue approach the search areas, they use Direction Finding (DF) equipment to locate the beacon using the 121.5 MHz homing signal, or in newer EPIRBs, the AIS location signal. The basic purpose of this system is to help rescuers find survivors within the so-called &quot;golden day&quot; (the first 24 hours following a traumatic event) during which the majority of survivors can usually be saved. The feature distinguishing a modern EPIRB, often called GPIRB, from other types of emergency beacon is that it contains a GPS receiver and broadcasts its position, usually accurate within , to facilitate location. Previous emergency beacons without a GPS can only be localized to within by the COSPAS satellites and relied heavily upon the 121.5 MHz homing signal to pin-point the beacons location as they arrived on scene.

The standard frequency of a modern EPIRB is 406 MHz. It is an internationally regulated mobile radiocommunication service that aids search-and-rescue operations to detect and locate distressed watercraft, aircraft, and people.

The first form of these beacons was the 121.5 MHz ELT, which was designed as an automatic locator beacon for crashed military aircraft. These beacons were first used in the 1950s by the U.S. military, and were mandated for use on many types of commercial and general-aviation aircraft beginning in the early 1970s. The frequency and signal format used by the ELT beacons was not designed for satellite detection, which resulted in a system with poor location detection abilities and long delays in detection of activated beacons. The satellite detection network was built after the ELT beacons were already in general use, with the first satellite not being launched until 1982, and even then, the satellites only provided detection, with location accuracy being roughly . The technology was later expanded to cover use on vessels at sea (EPIRB), individual persons (PLB), and starting in 2016, maritime survivor locating devices (MSLD). All have migrated from using 121.500 MHz as their primary frequency to using 406 MHz, which was designed for satellite detection and location, however most models still broadcast a secondary signal on 121.5 MHz as well, as this helps rescue teams pinpoint the location of survivors once in their vicinity with more accuracy (within 2km) than the 406 MHz frequency allows on its own.

Since the inception of Cospas-Sarsat in 1982, distress radio beacons have assisted in the rescue of over 50,000 people in more than 7,000 distress situations. In 2010 alone, the system provided information used to rescue 2,388 persons in 641 distress situations.

The several types of emergency locator beacons are distinguished by the environment for which they were designed to be used:
* ELT (emergency locator transmitters) are carried on aircraft and are activated in the event of a crash.
** Activated by G-switch (crash sensor) or manually by cockpit remote switch or ON switch on ELT.
* EPIRB (emergency position-indicating radio beacons) are carried on ships and boats, and signal maritime distress.
** Activated by water when the beacon is out of the bracket or manually by the ON switch on the EPIRB.
* SEPIRB (submarine emergency position-indicating radio beacons) are EPIRBs designed only for use on submarines.
* SSAS (ship security alert systems) are used to indicate possible piracy or terrorism attacks discreetly on sea-going vessels.
** Activated by discreet switch/button in the ship&#x27;s bridge or cabin, or manually on the SSAS.
* PLB (personal locator beacons) are carried by individuals and intended to indicate a person in distress who is away from normal emergency services; e.g., 9-1-1. They are also used for crew-saving applications in shipping and lifeboats at terrestrial systems. In New South Wales, some police stations and the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service provide personal locator beacons to hikers for no charge.
** Activated manually by deploying antenna and pressing the ON button/switch.
Distress alerts transmitted from ELTs, EPIRBs, SSAS, and PLBs are received and processed by the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, the international satellite system for search and rescue (SAR). These beacons transmit a 406 MHz distress signal every 50 seconds, varying over a span of 2.5 seconds to avoid multiple beacons always transmitting at the same time.

When manually activated, or automatically activated upon immersion or impact, such beacons send out a distress signal. The signals are monitored worldwide and the location of the distress is detected by non-geostationary satellites using the Doppler effect for trilateration, and in more recent EPIRBs, also by GPS.

Loosely related devices, including search and rescue transponders (SART), AIS-SART, avalanche transceivers, and RECCO do not operate on 406 MHz, thus are covered in separate articles.

== International COSPAS-SARSAT Programme ==
Cospas-Sarsat is an international organization that has been a model of international cooperation, even during the Cold War. SARSAT means search-and-rescue satellite-aided tracking. COSPAS (&quot;КОСПАС&quot;) is an acronym for the Russian words &quot;&quot;COsmicheskaya&quot; &quot;Sistema Poiska Avariynyh Sudov&quot;&quot; (Космическая Система Поиска Аварийных Судов), which translates to &quot;space system for the search of vessels in distress&quot;. A consortium of USSR, the U.S., Canada, and France formed the organization in 1982. Since then, 29 other countries have joined.

The satellites used in the system include:
* LEOSAR or Low Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue Satellites
** The LEOSAR system calculates the location of distress events using Doppler processing techniques. Doppler processing is based upon the principle that the frequency of the distress beacon, as &quot;heard&quot; by the satellite instrument, is affected by the relative velocity of the satellite with respect to the beacon. By monitoring the change of the beacon frequency of the received beacon signal and knowing the exact position of the satellite, the LUT is able to calculate the location of the beacon.
* GEOSAR or Geosynchronous Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue Satellites
** As a GEOSAR satellite remains fixed relative to the Earth rotating with the earth around the equator, GEOSAR satellites utilize the GPS provided by the EPIRB, PLB, or ELT to provide rescuers with beacon position information.
* MEOSAR or Mid-Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue Satellites
** The newest of the Cospas Sarsat satellites, detect EPIRB, PLB, and ELT distress signals in almost real-time (i.e within 5 minutes) including the beacons location with or without GPS.
** The new MEOSAR system also provides the framework along with the Galileo Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for EPIRBs, PLBs, and EPIRBs to utilize the new Return Link Service or RLS that provides a confirmation message from Search and Rescue back to the beacon to let the survivors know their distress message was confirmed.

Cospas-Sarsat defines standards for beacons, auxiliary equipment to be mounted on conforming weather and communication satellites, ground stations, and communications methods. The satellites communicate the beacon data to their ground stations, which forward it to main control centers of each nation that can initiate a rescue effort.

Cospas Sarsat Monitoring include:

* Local User Terminals (LUTs)
* Mission Control Centers (MCC)
* Rescue Coordination Center (RCC)

== Detection and location ==

A transmission is typically detected and processed in this manner:
# The transmitter is activated, either automatically in a crash or after sinking, or manually by survivors of an emergency situation.
# At least one satellite picks up the beacon&#x27;s transmission.
# The satellites transfer the beacon&#x27;s signal to their respective ground control stations.
# The ground stations process the signals and forward the data, including approximate location, to a national authority.
# The national authority forwards the data to a rescue authority
# The rescue authority uses its own receiving equipment afterwards to locate the beacon and commence its own rescue or recovery operations.

Once the satellite data is received, less than a minute is needed to forward them to any signatory nation. The primary means of detection and location is by the COSPAS-SARSAT satellites. However, additional means of location are frequently used. For example, the FAA requires that all pilots monitor 121.500 MHz whenever possible, and the USCG has a network of direction finder sites along the coastlines. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintains a near-real-time map that shows SARSAT U.S. Rescues.

Several systems are in use, with beacons of varying expense, different types of satellites, and varying performance. Carrying even the oldest systems provides an immense improvement in safety over carrying none.

The types of satellites in the network are:
* LEOSAR
** Support Doppler detection and reception of encoded position
** Receivers are payloads on various Low Earth Orbit satellites
* MEOSAR
** Medium Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue
** Receivers are payloads on the U.S. GPS satellites, on the Russian GLONASS satellites, and on the European GALILEO satellites.
* GEOSAR
** Supports only reception of encoded position
** Receivers are payloads on various geosynchronous satellites, including some of the U.S. GOES weather satellites (including GOES-16).
When one of the COSPAS-SARSAT satellites detects a beacon, the detection is passed to one of the program&#x27;s roughly 30 Mission Control Centers, such as USMCC (in Suitland, Maryland), where the detected location and beacon details are used to determine to which rescue coordination centre (for example, the U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s PACAREA RCC, in Alameda, California) to pass the alert.

===Beacon operation===
====GPS-based, registered====
The 406-MHz beacons with GPS track with a precision of 100 m in the 70% of the world closest to the equator, and send a serial number so the responsible authority can look up phone numbers to notify the registrant (e.g., next-of-kin) in four minutes.

The GPS system permits stationary, wide-view geosynchronous communications satellites to enhance the Doppler position received by low Earth orbit satellites. EPIRB beacons with built-in GPS are usually called GPIRBs, for GPS position-indicating radio beacon or global position-indicating radio beacon.

However, rescue cannot begin until a Doppler track is available. The COSPAS-SARSAT specifications say that a beacon location is not considered &quot;resolved&quot; unless at least two Doppler tracks match or a Doppler track confirms an encoded (GPS) track. One or more GPS tracks are not sufficient.

====High-precision registered====
An intermediate technology 406-MHz beacon (now mostly obsolete in favor of GPS-enabled units) has worldwide coverage, locates within 2 km (12.5 km2 search area), notifies kin and rescuers in 2 hours maximum (46 min average), and has a serial number to look up phone numbers, etc. This can take up to two hours because it has to use moving weather satellites to locate the beacon. To help locate the beacon, the beacon&#x27;s frequency is controlled to 2 parts per billion, and its power is five watts.

Both of the above types of beacons usually include an auxiliary 25-milliwatt beacon at 121.5 MHz to guide rescue aircraft.

====Traditional ELT, unregistered====
The oldest, cheapest beacons are aircraft ELTs that send an anonymous warble on the aviation band distress frequency at 121.5 MHz. The frequency is often routinely monitored by commercial aircraft, but has not been monitored by satellite since Feb. 1, 2009.

These distress signals could be detected by satellite over only 60% of the earth, required up to 6 hours for notification, located within (search area of 1200 km2), were anonymous, and could not be located well because their frequency is only accurate to 50 parts per million and the signals were broadcast using only 75–100 milliwatts of power. Coverage was partial because the satellite had to be in view of both the beacon and a ground station at the same time; the satellites did not store and forward the beacon&#x27;s position. Coverage in polar and Southern Hemisphere areas was poor.

False alarms were common, as the beacon transmitted on the aviation emergency frequency, with interference from other electronic and electrical systems. To reduce false alarms, a beacon was confirmed by a second satellite pass, which could easily slow confirmation of a &#x27;case&#x27; of distress to as much as 4 hours (although in rare circumstances, the satellites could be positioned such that immediate detection becomes possible.)

====Location by Doppler (without GPS)====
The Cospas-Sarsat system was made possible by Doppler processing. Local-user terminals (LUTs) detecting nongeostationary satellites interpret the Doppler frequency shift heard by LEOSAR and MEOSAR satellites as they pass over a beacon transmitting at a fixed frequency. The interpretation determines both bearing and range. The range and bearing are measured from the rate of change of the heard frequency, which varies both according to the path of the satellite in space and the rotation of the earth. This triangulates the position of the beacon. A faster change in the Doppler indicates that the beacon is closer to the satellite&#x27;s orbit. If the beacon is moving toward or away from the satellite track due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation, it is on one side or other of the satellite&#x27;s path. Doppler shift is zero at the closest point of approach between the beacon and the orbit.

If the beacon&#x27;s frequency is more precise, it can be located more precisely, saving search time, so modern 406-MHz beacons are accurate to 2 parts per billion, giving a search area of only 2 km2, compared to the older beacons accurate to 50 parts per million that had 200 km2 of search area.

To increase the useful power, and handle multiple simultaneous beacons, modern 406-MHz beacons transmit in bursts, and remain silent for about 50 seconds.

Russia developed the original system, and its success drove the desire to develop the improved 406-MHz system. The original system was a brilliant adaptation to the low-quality beacons, originally designed to aid air searches. It used just a simple, lightweight transponder on the satellite, with no digital recorders or other complexities. Ground stations listened to each satellite as long as it was above the horizon. Doppler shift was used to locate the beacon(s). Multiple beacons were separated when a computer program analysed the signals with a fast Fourier transform. Also, two satellite passes per beacon were used. This eliminated false alarms by using two measurements to verify the beacon&#x27;s location from two different bearings. This prevented false alarms from VHF channels that affected a single satellite. Regrettably, the second satellite pass almost doubled the average time before notification of the rescuing authority. However, the notification time was much less than a day.

===Satellites===
Receivers are auxiliary systems mounted on several types of satellites. This substantially reduces the program&#x27;s cost. The weather satellites that carry the SARSAT receivers are in &quot;ball of yarn&quot; orbits, inclined at 99 degrees. The longest period that all satellites can be out of line-of-sight of a beacon is about two hours. The first satellite constellation was launched in the early 1970s by the Soviet Union, Canada, France and the United States.

Some geosynchronous satellites have beacon receivers. Since the end of 2003, there are four such geostationary satellites (GEOSAR) that cover more than 80% of the surface of the earth. As with all geosynchronous satellites, they are located above the equator. The GEOSAR satellites do not cover the polar caps. Since they see the Earth as a whole, they see the beacon immediately, but have no motion, and thus no Doppler frequency shift to locate it. However, if the beacon transmits GPS data, the geosynchronous satellites give nearly instantaneous response.

==Search-and-rescue response==
Emergency beacons operating on 406 MHz transmit a unique 15-, 22-, or 30-character serial number called a hex code. When the beacon is purchased, the hex code should be registered with the relevant national (or international) authority. After one of the mission control centers has detected the signal, this registration information is passed to the rescue coordination center, which then provides the appropriate search-and-rescue agency with crucial information, such as:
* phone numbers to call
* a description of the vessel, aircraft, vehicle, or person (in the case of a PLB)
* the home port of a vessel or aircraft
* any additional information that may be useful to SAR agencies

Registration information allows SAR agencies to start a rescue more quickly. For example, if a shipboard telephone number listed in the registration is unreachable, it could be assumed that a real distress event is occurring. Conversely, the information provides a quick and easy way for the SAR agencies to check and eliminate false alarms (potentially sparing the beacon&#x27;s owner from significant false alert fines).

An unregistered 406-MHz beacon still carries some information, such as the manufacturer and serial number of the beacon, and in some cases, an MMSI or aircraft tail number/ICAO 24-bit address. Despite the clear benefits of registration, an unregistered 406-MHz beacon is very substantially better than a 121.5-MHz beacon, because the hex code received from a 406-MHz beacon confirms the authenticity of the signal as a real distress signal.

Beacons operating on 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz only simply transmit an anonymous siren tone, thus carry no position or identity information to SAR agencies. Such beacons now rely solely on the terrestrial or aeronautical monitoring of the frequency.

===Responsible agencies===
RCCs are responsible for a geographic area, known as a &quot;search-and-rescue region of responsibility&quot; (SRR). SRRs are designated by the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. RCCs are operated unilaterally by personnel of a single military service (e.g. an air force, or a navy) or a single civilian service (e.g. a national police force, or a coast guard).

==== Americas ====
These international search-and-rescue points of contact receive SAR alerts from the USMCC.
===== United States =====
The U.S. NOAA operates the U.S. Mission Control Center (USMCC) in Suitland, Maryland.
It distributes beacon signal reports to one or more of these RCCs:
The US Coast Guard web page for EPIRBs states: &quot;You may be fined for false activation of an unregistered EPIRB. The US Coast Guard routinely refers cases involving the nondistress activation of an EPIRB (e.g., as a hoax, through gross negligence, carelessness, or improper storage and handling) to the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC will prosecute cases based upon evidence provided by the Coast Guard, and will issue warning letters or notices of apparent liability for fines up to $10,000.&quot;

===== Canada =====
The Canadian Mission Control Centre receives and distributes distress alerts.

In Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Forces Search and Rescue (Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Navy) are partners in Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centres; CCG operates Maritime Rescue Subcentres to offload work from JRCC.
==== Europe ====
===== United Kingdom =====
The United Kingdom, the Department for Transport, Maritime and Coastguard Agency operates the Mission Control Centre (UKMCC), which receives and distributes distress alerts.

In the UK, the Distress and Diversion Cell of the Royal Air Force provides continuous monitoring of 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz, with autotriangulation from a network of terrestrial receivers on both frequencies.

== Phase-out of 121.5 MHz satellite alerting service ==
Because of the extremely high numbers of false alerts on the 121.500 MHz frequency (over 98% of all COSPAS-SARSAT alerts), the IMO eventually requested a termination of COSPAS-SARSAT processing of 121.5 MHz signals. The ICAO Council also agreed to this phase-out request, and the COSPAS-SARSAT Council decided that future satellites would no longer carry the 121.5 MHz search and rescue repeater (SARR). Since 1 February 2009, only 406 MHz beacons are detected by the international Cospas-Sarsat SAR satellite system. This affects all maritime beacons (EPIRBs), all aviation beacons (ELTs) and all personal beacons (PLBs). In other words, Cospas-Sarsat has ceased satellite detection and processing of 121.5/243 MHz beacons. These older beacons are now only detectable by ground-based receivers and aircraft.

EPIRBs that do not transmit on 406 MHz are banned on boats in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. More information about the switch to 406 MHz is available on Cospas-Sarsat&#x27;s 121.5/243 Phase-Out page.

Despite the switch to 406 MHz, pilots and ground stations are encouraged to continue to monitor for transmissions on the emergency frequencies, as most 406 MHz beacons are required to be equipped with 121.5 &quot;homers.&quot; Furthermore, the 121.5 MHz frequency remains the official global VHF aircraft voice distress frequency.

===FAA transition status===
In a Safety Recommendation released September 2007, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board once again recommended that the U.S. FAA require all aircraft have 406 MHz ELTs. They first recommended this back in 2000 and after vigorous opposition by AOPA, the FAA declined to do so. Citing two recent accidents, one with a 121.5 MHz ELT and one with a 406 MHz ELT, the NTSB concludes that switching all ELTs to 406 MHz is a necessary goal to work towards.

NASA has conducted crash tests with small airplanes to investigate how ELTs perform.

== Emergency Locator Transmitters ==

Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) are expensive devices (average cost for aviation use is $1500–3000). In commercial aircraft, a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder must contain an underwater locator beacon. In the US, ELTs are required to be permanently installed in most general aviation aircraft, depending upon the type or location of operation.

The specifications for the design of ELTs are published by the RTCA, and in the specification the alarm signal is defined as an AM signal (A3X and/or N0N emissions), containing a swept tone ranging from 1600 Hz to 300 Hz (downwards), with 2-4 sweeps per second. When activated, 406 MHz units transmit a 0.5 second, 5-watt digital burst every 50 seconds, varying within a span of ±2.5 seconds somewhat randomly, so as to avoid multiple ELTs always having their beacons synchronized.

As per 14 CFR 91.207.a.1, ELTs built according to TSO-C91 (of the type described below as &quot;Traditional ELT, unregistered&quot;) have not been permitted for new installations since June 21, 1995; the replacing standard was TSO-C91a. Furthermore, TSO-C91/91a ELTs are being replaced / supplemented by the TSO C126 406 MHz ELT, a far superior unit.

ELTs are unique among distress radiobeacons in that they have impact monitors and are activated by g-force.

Although monitoring of 121.5 and 243 MHz (Class B) distress signals by satellite ceased in February 2009, the FAA has not mandated an upgrade of older ELT units to 406 MHz in United States aircraft. Transport Canada has put forward a proposed regulatory requirement that requires upgrade to Canadian registered aircraft to either a 406 MHz ELT or an alternate means system; however, elected officials have overruled the recommendation of Transport Canada for the regulation and have asked for a looser regulation to be drafted by Transport Canada. Recent information indicates Transport Canada may permit private, general aviation flight with only an existing 121.5 MHz ELT if there is a placard visible to all passengers stating to the effect that the aircraft does not comply with international recommendations for the carriage of the 406 MHz emergency alerting device and is not detectable by satellites in the event of a crash.

In the case of 121.5 MHz beacons, the frequency is known in aviation as the &quot;VHF Guard&quot; emergency frequency, and all U.S. civilian pilots (private and commercial) are required, by FAA policy, to monitor this frequency when it is possible to do so. The frequency can be used by Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) radionavigation equipment, which is being phased out in favor of VOR and GPS but is still found on many aircraft. ELTs are relatively large, and would fit in a cube about on a side, and weigh .

ELTs were first mandated in 1973 by FAA technical standard order (TSO-C91). The original TSO-C91, and updated TSO-C91A were officially deprecated as of February 2, 2009, when reception of the 121.5 MHz signal was deactivated on all of the SAR satellite, in favor of the C126 ELT models, with their 406 MHz Cospas-Sarsat beacons. However, the 121.5 MHz signal is still used for close-in direction finding of a downed aircraft.

=== ELT activation ===
Automatic ELTs have impact monitors activated by g-force. Numerous activities, such as aerobatics, hard landings, movement by ground crews and aircraft maintenances, can generate false alarms, which can interfere with and cannot be distinguished from genuine emergency transmissions.

===ELT sub-classification===
Emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) for aircraft may be classed as follows:
* A: automatically ejected
* AD: automatic deployable
* F: Fixed
* AF: automatic fixed
* AP: automatic portable
* W: water activated
* S: survival

Within these classes, an ELT may be either a digital 406 MHz beacon, or an analog beacon (see below).

====Obsolete ELTs====
* Any ELT that is not a 406 MHz ELT with a Hex Code became obsolete February 1, 2009.

According to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, ground testing of A-, B-, and S-type ELTs is to be done within the first 5 minutes of each hour. Testing is restricted to three audio sweeps. Type I and II devices (those transmitting at 406 MHz) have a self test function and must not be activated except in an actual emergency.

=== Timeline of ELT development ===
* Automatic SOS radios were developed as early as the 1930s.
* The United States Air Force institutes development of a &quot;Crash-Locator Beacon&quot; and a &quot;Crash-Locator Bearing Recorder&quot; in the early 1950s.
* In the UK, by 1959 the first automatic beacon for liferafts had been produced by Ultra Electronics, and at the same time Burndept produced the TALBE (Talk and Listen Beacon Equipment) - VHF, and SARBE - Search-And-Rescue-Beacon Equipment (UHF) range of beacons which were used by the Fleet Air Arm and later, Royal Air Force. Later, SARBE beacons included a radio for voice communication by the survivor with the rescuing personnel.
* Jan 9 1964: FAA Advisory Circular 170-4 investigated ELTs
* Mar 17 1969: FAA Advisory Circular 91-19 advised pilots to install ELTs
* A Saturday Evening Post article covered the death of 16-year-old Carla Corbus, who survived, though badly injured, along with her mother, for 54 days after the plane her step-dad was flying crashed in the Trinity Alps of California in March 1967. He was lost and died in the woods looking for rescue.
* The winter 1969 search for the Hawthorne Nevada Airlines Flight 708 &quot;Gamblers&#x27; Special&quot; DC-3 that crashed on February 18, 1969 in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Five aircraft crashed and five searchers were killed while trying to find Flight 708.
* Carriage requirements for emergency locator beacons on most US non-jet powered fixed-wing civil aircraft became law on December 29, 1970, with the signing of Senate bill S.2193, &quot;The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,&quot; Public Law 91-596. as a last-minute rider to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Senator Peter Dominick (R-Colorado) added the unrelated beacon language as a rider to the bill, which became section 31 of the law. (Earlier in the session he tried to add the requirements as an amendment to House bill H.R. 14465, the &quot;Airport and Airways Development Act of 1969,&quot; but was unsuccessful.) It required most general aviation aircraft to install ELTs by Dec. 30, 1973, and it preempted all the state ELT laws. The federal ELT law left the matter of alerting vague, although the initial idea was alerting by over flying aircraft which could receive an ELT&#x27;s 75-milliwatt signal from 50 nautical miles away. The law set the compliance dates as one year after passage for newly manufactured or imported aircraft (December 30, 1971), and three years for existing aircraft (December 30, 1973). In response to the law, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published on March 13, 1971, Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) 71–7 with the proposed amendments to the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). After public comment, the final rules were published in the Federal Register on September 21, 1971.
* The disappearance of U.S. Congressmen Hale Boggs and Nick Begich in a general aviation aircraft on October 16, 1972 sparked the then largest ever search and rescue effort, which proved fruitless. This high-profile event further hastened the mandating of ELTs aboard aircraft.
* The RTCA published DO-145, DO-146, and DO-147, which the FAA then adopted the three DO documents as Technical Standard Order TSO C91.
* After problems with the C-91 ELTs, The FAA responded to the defective early ELTs by outlawing the installation of C-91 ELTs and certifying C91a ELTs with an improved gravity switch, improved crash and fire-worthy casing, and batteries that work in colder temperatures.
* March 16, 1973: AC 20–85, Emergency Locator Transmitters and Receivers
* Dec 23, 1992: TSO-C126, 406 MHz Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) defines the 406 MHz ELT

== Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon ==
Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) are a development of the ELT designed specifically for use on boats and ships, and basic models tend to be less expensive than ELTs (average cost is $800). As such, instead of using an impact sensor to activate the beacon, they typically use a water-sensing device or a submerged-sensing device that activates and releases a floating beacon after it has been submerged in between 1 and 4 meters of water. In addition to the 406 MHz signal mandated by C/S T.001, the IMO and ICAO require an auxiliary 121.5 MHz at another frequency in order to support the large installed base of 121.5 MHz direction finding equipment.

The RTCM (Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services) maintains specifications specific to EPIRB devices. The alarm signal is defined as an AM signal (A3X and/or N0N emissions), containing a swept tone ranging from 1600 Hz to 300 Hz (either upwards or downwards), with 2-4 sweeps per second.

EPIRBs with an AIS transmitter are allocated MMSI numbers in the range 974yyzzzz.
===EPIRB sub-classification===
Emergency position-indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs) are sub-classified as follows:

Recognized categories:
* Category I – 406/121.5 MHz. Float-free, automatically activated EPIRB. Detectable by satellite anywhere in the world. Recognized by GMDSS.
* Category II – 406/121.5 MHz. Similar to Category I, except is manually activated. Some models are also water activated.

Obsolete classes:
* Class A – 121.5/243 MHz. Float-free, automatically activating. Due to limited signal coverage and possible lengthy delays in signal recognition, the U.S. Coast Guard no longer recommends use of this type. These devices have been phased out by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and &quot;are no longer recognized&quot;.
* Class B – 121.5/243 MHz. Manually activated version of Class A. These devices have been phased out by the FCC and &quot;are no longer recognized&quot;.
* Class S – 121.5/243 MHz. Similar to Class B, except it floats, or is an integral part of a survival craft (lifeboat) or survival suit. These devices have been phased out by the FCC and &quot;are no longer recognized&quot;. Their use is no longer recommended by the U.S. Coast Guard.
* Class C – Marine VHF ch15/16. Manually activated, these beacons operate on maritime channels only, and therefore are not detectable by satellite or normal aircraft. Designed for small crafts operating close to shore, this type was only recognized in the United States. Use of these units was phased out in 1999. These devices have been phased out by the FCC and &quot;are no longer recognized&quot;.
* Inmarsat-E – This entered service in 1997 and service ended 1 December 2006; all former users have switched to Category I or II 406 MHz EPIRBs. These beacons were float-free, automatically activated EPIRBs operated on 1646 MHz and were detectable by the Inmarsat geostationary satellite system, and were recognized by GMDSS, but not by the United States. In September 2004, Inmarsat announced that it was terminating its &quot;Inmarsat E&quot; EPIRB service as of December 2006 due to a lack of interest in the maritime community.
* Furthermore, the U.S. Coast Guard recommend that no EPIRB of any type manufactured before 1989 be used.
EPIRBs are a component of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). Most commercial off-shore working vessels with passengers are required to carry a self-deploying EPIRB, while most in-shore and fresh-water craft are not.

As part of the United States efforts to prepare beacon users for the end of 121.5 MHz frequency processing by satellites, the FCC has prohibited the use of 121.5 MHz EPIRBs as of January 1, 2007 (47 CFR 80.1051). See NOAA&#x27;s statement on the 121.5/243 phaseout .

=== EPIRB activation ===
Automatic EPIRBs are water activated. Some EPIRBs also &quot;deploy&quot;; this means that they physically depart from their mounting bracket on the exterior of the vessel (usually by going into the water.)

For a marine EPIRB to begin transmitting a signal (or &quot;activate&quot;) it first needs to come out of its bracket (or &quot;deploy&quot;). Deployment can happen either manually where someone must physically remove it from its bracket or automatically where water pressure will cause a hydrostatic release unit to separate the EPIRB from its bracket. If it does not come out of the bracket it will not activate. There is a magnet in the bracket which operates a reed safety switch in the EPIRB. This prevents accidental activation if the unit gets wet from rain or shipped seas.

Once deployed, EPIRBs can be activated, depending on the circumstances, either manually (crewman flicks a switch) or automatically (when water contacts the unit&#x27;s &quot;sea-switch&quot;.) All modern EPIRBs provide both methods of activation and deployment, and thus are labelled &quot;Manual and Automatic Deployment and Activation.&quot;

==== Automatic hydrostatic release unit ====
A hydrostatic release unit is designed to deploy automatically when submerged to a prescribed depth; the pressure of the water activates a mechanism which releases the EPIRB.
== Submarine Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio Beacon ==
A Submarine Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio Beacon (SEPIRB) is an EPIRB that is approved for use on submarines. Two are carried on board and can be fired from the submerged signal ejectors.

== Ship Security Alert System ==

A Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) is a special variety of an EPIRB designed to alert the ship&#x27;s owner(s) of a possible piracy or terrorist attack. They thus have several distinguishing operational differences:
* They are manually activated by hidden buttons or switches, much like the alarms bank tellers use.
* They are prohibited from emitting a homing signal on 121.5 MHz so as to make transmissions more covert.
* The COSPAS-SARSAT system sends the distress message to the vessel&#x27;s country of origin, regardless of the location of the vessel.
As with EPIRBs, the RTCM maintains specifications for SSAS devices.

== Personal Locator Beacon ==

Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) are designed for use by individuals who are hiking, kayaking, or conducting other activities on land or water where they are not in or associated with an aircraft or vessel that is equipped with its own ELT or EPIRB. As with EPIRBs, the RTCM maintains specifications for PLB devices.

PLBs vary in size from cigarette-packet to paperback book and weigh 200 g to 1 kg ( to 2 lb). They can be purchased from marine suppliers, aircraft refitters, and (in Australia and the United States) hiking supply stores. The units have a useful life of 10 years, operate across a range of conditions , and transmit for 24 to 48 hours. The alarm signal is defined as an AM signal (A3X and/or N0N emissions), containing a swept tone ranging from 300 Hz to 1600 Hz (upwards), with 2–4 sweeps per second. PLBs shall sweep upward.

PLB alerts are passed to State and Local agencies.

They must be registered to a specific person (with NOAA in the U.S.).

PLB equipment is required to include 406 MHz plus a homing frequency on 121.5 MHz.

As of 2017, PLBs must have an internal GPS.

===PLB sub-classification===
There are two kinds of personal locator beacon (PLB):
* PLB with GPS data (internally or externally provided)
* PLB with no GPS data

All PLBs transmit in digital mode on 406 MHz. There are AIS PLBs that transmit on VHF 70.

Personal locator beacons operating on 406 MHz must be registered. PLBs should not be used in cases where normal emergency response (such as 9-1-1) exists.

====Obsolete PLBs====
* U.S. Military forces at one time used 121.5/243.0 MHz beacons such as the &quot;PRC-106,&quot; which had a built-in VHF radio. The military is replacing them with modern 406 MHz PLBs.

==Beacon content==
The most important aspect of a beacon in classification is the mode of transmission. There are two valid transmission modes: digital and analog. Where digital usually has a longer range, analog is more reliable. Analog beacons are useful to search parties and SAR aircraft, though they are no longer monitored by satellite.

===Analog 121.500 MHz homing signal===
All ELTs, all PLBs, and most EPIRBs are required to have a low-power homing signal, that is identical to the original 121.500 MHz VHF beacon signal. However, due to the extremely large number of false alarms that the old beacons generated, the transmit power was greatly reduced, and because the VHF transmitter typically uses the same antenna as the UHF beacon, the radiated signal is further reduced by the inherent inefficiencies of transmitting with an antenna not tuned to the transmitted signal.

===Digital 406 MHz beacons===
406 MHz UHF beacons transmit bursts of digital information to orbiting satellites, and may also contain a low-power integrated analog (121.500 MHz) homing beacon. They can be uniquely identified (via GEOSAR). Advanced beacons encode a GPS or GLONASS position into the signal. All beacons are located by Doppler triangulation to confirm the location. The digital data identifies the registered user. A phone call by authorities to the registered phone number often eliminates false alarms (false alarms are the typical case). If there is a problem, the beacon location data guides search and rescue efforts. No beacon is ignored. Anonymous beacons are confirmed by two Doppler tracks before beginning beacon location efforts.

The distress message transmitted by a 406 beacon contains the information such as:
* Which country the beacon originates from.
* A unique 15-digit hexadecimal beacon identification code (a &quot;15-hex ID&quot;).
* The encoded identification of the vessel or aircraft in distress, either as an MMSI value, or as, in the case of an ELT, either the aircraft&#x27;s registration or its ICAO 24-bit address (from its Mode-S transponder)&quot;.&quot;
* When equipped, a GPS position.
* Whether or not the beacon contains a 121.5 MHz homing transmitter.

The digital distress message generated by the beacon varies according to the above factors and is encoded in 30 hexadecimal characters. The unique 15-character digital identity (the 15-hex ID) is hard-coded in the firmware of the beacon. The 406.025 MHz carrier signal is modulated plus or minus 1.1 radians with the data encoded using Manchester encoding, which ensures a net zero phase shift aiding Doppler location

====406 MHz beacon facts and transmission schedule====
* 406 MHz beacons transmit for a quarter of a second immediately when turned on, and then transmit a digital burst once every 50 seconds thereafter. Both GEOSAR and LEOSAR satellites monitor these signals.
* The repetition period shall not be so stable that any two transmitters appear to be synchronized closer than a few seconds over a 5-minute period. The intent is that no two beacons will have all of their bursts coincident. The period shall be randomised around a mean value of 50 seconds, so that time intervals between transmission are randomly distributed on the interval 47.5 to 52.5 seconds. (specification for first-generation beacons)
* Preliminary specification for second-generation beacons. From beacon activation a total of [6] initial transmissions shall be made separated by fixed [5s ± 0.1s] intervals. The first transmission shall commence within [3] seconds of beacon activation. Transmissions shall then occur at nominally [30] second intervals until [30 ± 1] minutes after beacon activation. The repetition period between the start of two successive transmissions shall be randomised around the stated nominal value, so that intervals between successive transmissions are randomly distributed over ± [5] seconds. Subsequent transmissions [TBD].
* 406 MHz beacons will be the only beacons compatible with the MEOSAR (DASS) system.
* 406 MHz beacons must be registered (see below).

====Hex codes====
Example hex codes look like the following: 90127B92922BC022FF103504422535
* A bit telling whether the message is short (15 hex digits) or long (30 hex digits) format.
* A country code, which lets the worldwide COSPAS/SARSAT central authority identify the national authority responsible for the beacon.
* Embedded 15-Hex ID or 15-hex transmitted distress message, for example, 2024F72524FFBFF The hex ID is printed or stamped on the outside of the beacon and is hard-coded into its firmware. The 15-hex ID can only be reprogrammed by certified distress radiobeacon technicians. The national authority uses this number to look up phone numbers and other contact information for the beacon. This is crucial to handle the large number of false alarms generated by beacons.
* A location protocol number, and type of location protocol: EPIRB or MMSI, as well as all the data fields of that location protocol. If the beacon is equipped with GPS or GLONASS, a rough (rounded) latitude and longitude giving the beacon&#x27;s current position. In some aircraft beacons, this data is taken from the aircraft&#x27;s navigation system.
* When a beacon is sold to another country, the purchaser is responsible for having the beacon reprogrammed with a new country code and to register it with their nation&#x27;s beacon registry, and the seller is responsible to de-register the deprecated beacon ID with their national beacon registry.
* One can use the beacon decoder web page at Cospas-Sarsat to extract the 15-hex ID from the 30-hex distress message.

==Frequencies==
Distress beacons transmit distress signals on the following key frequencies; the frequency used distinguishes the capabilities of the beacon. A &quot;recognized&quot; beacon can operate on one of the three (currently) Cospas-Sarsat satellite-compatible frequencies. In the past, other frequencies were also used as a part of the search and rescue system.

===Cospas-Sarsat (satellite) compatible beacon frequencies===

==License and registration requirements==
=== License ===
In North America and Australasia (and most jurisdictions in Europe) no special license is required to operate an EPIRB. In some countries (for example the Netherlands) a marine radio operators license is required. The following paragraphs define other requirements relating to EPIRBs, ELTs, and PLBs.

===Registration===
All distress alerting beacons operating on 406 MHz should be registered; all vessels and aircraft operating under International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations must register their beacons. Some national administrations (including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the UK) also require registration of 406 MHz beacons.
* There is no charge to register 406 MHz beacons.
* The U.S. Coast Guard warns that a user&#x27;s &quot;life may be saved as a result of registered emergency information&quot; because it can respond more quickly to signals from registered beacons.
* Unless the national registry authority advises otherwise, personal information contained in a beacon is used exclusively for SAR distress alert resolution purposes.

The Cospas-Sarsat Handbook of Beacon Regulations provides the status of 406 MHz beacon regulations in specific countries and extracts of some international regulations pertaining to 406 MHz beacons.

The following list shows the agencies accepting 406 beacon registrations by country:
* United States – National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
* Canada – Canadian Beacon Registry, CFB Trenton for civil beacons, CMCC for military beacons
* Australia – Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)
* United Kingdom – United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA)

==Alternative technologies==
There are also other personal devices in the marketplace which do not meet the standard for 406 MHz devices.

=== Maritime Survivor Locator Device ===
A Maritime Survivor Locator Device (MSLD) is a man-overboard locator beacon. In the U.S., rules were established in 2016 in 47 C.F.R. Part 95

MOB devices with DSC or AIS are allocated MMSI numbers in the range 972yyzzzz.

A MSLD may transmit on 121.500 MHz, or one of these: 156.525 MHz, 156.750 MHz, 156.800 MHz, 156.850 MHz, 161.975 MHz, 162.025 MHz (bold are Canadian-required frequencies). Although sometimes defined in the same standards as the COSPAS-SARSAT beacons, MSLDs can not be detected by that satellite network, and are instead intended only for short-range Direction finding equipment mounted on the vessel on which the survivor was traveling.

=== AIS SART ===

These devices are distinct from traditional SAR radar transponders (SART), as they transmit AIS messages containing accurate GPS position information and include a GPS receiver and a transmitter on VHF AIS channels, so they show up on ship AIS receivers. They are lightweight and can be used to equip inflatable liferafts.

AIS-SART devices are allocated MMSI numbers in the range 970YYxxxx.

=== SEND—Satellite Emergency Notification Device ===

These devices are commonly referred to as SEND (Satellite Emergency Notification Device), and examples include SPOT and inReach.

===APRS===

APRS is used by amateur radio operators to track positions and send short messages. Most APRS packets contain a GPS latitude and longitude, so they can be used for both normal and emergency tracking. They also are routed to the Internet, where they are archived for some period of time, and viewable by others. There are several emergency packet types that can indicate distress. Since it is part of the amateur radio service, it costs nothing to transmit on and uses the extensive network, however, one must be a licensed amateur radio operator. There is also no guarantee that an APRS distress packet report would be seen or handled by emergency responders. It would have to be seen by an amateur radio operator and forwarded on.

<text>Elm is a text-based email client commonly found on Unix systems. First released in 1986, it became popular as one of the first email clients to use a text user interface, and as a utility with freely available source code. The name &quot;elm&quot; originated from the phrase &quot;ELectronic Mail&quot;.

Dave Taylor (currently with Intuitive Systems) developed elm while working for Hewlett-Packard. Development later passed to a team of volunteers. The latest () public release was version 2.5.8 in August 2005.

Other popular text-based email readers which followed elm and took it as an inspiration include Pine (1989) and Mutt (1995). From about 1995 elm slipped in popularity and functionality, and it now sees relatively little use.

Bill Pemberton of the University of Virginia currently maintains elm. A former Elm Coordinator was Sydney Weinstein from the Myxa Corporation.

==Release history==
To get an idea of the period when elm was used and developed, this is a list of major.minor releases, included the last patch level.

* 1986-11-30 first release?
* 1987-03-08 elm2
* 1989-04-12 elm2.2

==Unofficial versions==
Volunteer developers have forked the Elm code several times, producing modern versions of Elm with fixes and enhancements not in the official development branch. Among the more popular of these distributions are Kari Hurtta&#x27;s &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; Elm 2.4 ME+ and Elm ME+ 2.5, both of which build upon Michael Elkins&#x27; extensions of Elm 2.4.24.

<text>In biology, tissue is an assembly of similar cells and their extracellular matrix from the same embryonic origin that together carry out a specific function. Tissues occupy a biological organizational level between cells and a complete organ. Accordingly, organs are formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues.

The English word &quot;tissue&quot; derives from the French word &quot;&quot;, the past participle of the verb tisser, &quot;to weave&quot;.

The study of tissues is known as histology or, in connection with disease, as histopathology. Xavier Bichat is considered as the &quot;Father of Histology&quot;. Plant histology is studied in both plant anatomy and physiology. The classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the histological stain, and the optical microscope. Developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue-sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling considerable refinement of medical diagnosis and prognosis.

== Plant tissue ==

In plant anatomy, tissues are categorized broadly into three tissue systems: the epidermis, the ground tissue, and the vascular tissue.
* Epidermis – Cells forming the outer surface of the leaves and of the young plant body.
* Vascular tissue – The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These transport fluids and nutrients internally.
* Ground tissue – Ground tissue is less differentiated than other tissues. Ground tissue manufactures nutrients by photosynthesis and stores reserve nutrients.

Plant tissues can also be divided differently into two types:

# Meristematic tissues
# Permanent tissues.

=== Meristematic tissue ===
Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells and leads to increase in length and thickness of the plant. The primary growth of a plant occurs only in certain specific regions, such as in the tips of stems or roots. It is in these regions that meristematic tissue is present. Cells of this type of tissue are roughly spherical or polyhedral to rectangular in shape, with thin cell walls. New cells produced by meristem are initially those of meristem itself, but as the new cells grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of meristematic tissue, being classified as:

1.Primary meristem.
* Apical meristem : Present at the growing tips of stems and roots, they increase the length of the stem and root. They form growing parts at the of roots and stems and are responsible for the increase in length, also called primary growth. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ.
2.Secondary meristem.

* Lateral meristem: Cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and girth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree as cork cambium and in vascular bundles of dicotyledons as vascular cambium. The activity of this cambium forms secondary growth.
* Intercalary meristem: Located between permanent tissues, it is usually present at the base of the node, internode, and on leaf base. They are responsible for growth in length of the plant and increasing the size of the internode. They result in branch formation and growth.

The cells of meristematic tissue are similar in structure and have a thin and elastic primary cell wall made of cellulose. They are compactly arranged without inter-cellular spaces between them. Each cell contains a dense cytoplasm and a prominent cell nucleus. The dense protoplasm of meristematic cells contains very few vacuoles. Normally the meristematic cells are oval, polygonal, or rectangular in shape.

Meristematic tissue cells have a large nucleus with small or no vacuoles because they have no need to store anything. Their basic function is to multiply and increase the girth and length of the plant, with no intercellular spaces.

=== Permanent tissues ===
Permanent tissues may be defined as a group of living or dead cells formed by meristematic tissue and have lost their ability to divide and have permanently placed at fixed positions in the plant body. Meristematic tissues that take up a specific role lose the ability to divide. This process of taking up a permanent shape, size and a function is called cellular differentiation. Cells of meristematic tissue differentiate to form different types of permanent tissues. There are 2 types of permanent tissues:
# simple permanent tissues
# complex permanent tissues

==== Simple permanent tissue ====
Simple permanent tissue is a group of cells which are similar in origin, structure, and function. They are of three types:
# Parenchyma
# Collenchyma
# Sclerenchyma

===== Parenchyma =====
Parenchyma (Greek, &quot;para&quot; – &#x27;beside&#x27;; enchyma– &quot;infusion&quot; – &#x27;tissue&#x27;) is the bulk of a substance. In plants, it consists of relatively unspecialized living cells with thin cell walls that are usually loosely packed so that intercellular spaces are found between cells of this tissue. These are generally isodiametric, in shape. They contain small number of vacuoles or sometimes they even may not contain any vacuole. Even if they do so the vacuole is of much smaller size than of normal animal cells. This tissue provides support to plants and also stores food. Chlorenchyma is a special type of parenchyma that contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis. In aquatic plants, aerenchyma tissues, or large air cavities, give support to float on water by making them buoyant. Parenchyma cells called idioblasts have metabolic waste. Spindle shaped fibers are also present in this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma, succulent parenchyma also noted. In xerophytes, parenchyma tissues store water.

=====Collenchyma=====
Collenchyma (Greek, &#x27;Colla&#x27; means gum and &#x27;enchyma&#x27; means infusion) is a living tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. Cells are thin-walled but possess thickening of cellulose, water and pectin substances (pectocellulose) at the corners where a number of cells join. This tissue gives tensile strength to the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little inter-cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. It is absent in monocots and in roots.

Collenchymatous tissue acts as a supporting tissue in stems of young plants. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the plant body. It helps in manufacturing sugar and storing it as starch. It is present in the margin of leaves and resists tearing effect of the wind.

===== Sclerenchyma =====
Sclerenchyma (Greek, &quot;Sclerous&quot; means hard and &quot;enchyma&quot; means infusion) consists of thick-walled, dead cells and protoplasm is negligible. These cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due to uniform distribution and high secretion of lignin and have a function of providing mechanical support. They do not have inter-cellular spaces between them. Lignin deposition is so thick that the cell walls become stronger, rigid and impermeable to water, which are also known as a stone cells or sclereids. These tissues are mainly of two types: sclerenchyma fiber and sclereids.
Sclerenchyma fiber cells have a narrow lumen and are long, narrow and unicellular. Fibers are elongated cells that are strong and flexible, often used in ropes. Sclereids have extremely thick cell walls and are brittle, and are found in nutshells and legumes.

===== Epidermis =====
The entire surface of the plant consists of a single layer of cells called epidermis or surface tissue. The entire surface of the plant has this outer layer of the epidermis. Hence it is also called surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. The cells form a continuous sheet without intercellular spaces. It protects all parts of the plant. The outer epidermis is coated with a waxy thick layer called cutin which prevents loss of water. The epidermis also consists of stomata (singular:stoma) which helps in transpiration.

==== Complex permanent tissue ====
The complex permanent tissue consists of more than one type of cells having a common origin which work together as a unit. Complex tissues are mainly concerned with the transportation of mineral nutrients, organic solutes (food materials), and water. That&#x27;s why it is also known as conducting and vascular tissue. The common types of complex permanent tissue are:
* Xylem (or wood)
* Phloem (or bast).

Xylem and phloem together form vascular bundles.

===== Xylem =====

Xylem (Greek, &quot;xylos&quot; = wood) serves as a chief conducting tissue of vascular plants. It is responsible for the conduction of water and inorganic solutes. Xylem consists of four kinds of cells:
* Tracheids
* Vessels (or tracheae)
* Xylem fibers or Xylem sclerenchyma
* Xylem parenchyma

Xylem tissue is organised in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cellssels tracheids, while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The end overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. The pit pairs allow water to pass from cell to cell.

Though most conduction in xylem tissue is vertical, lateral conduction along the diameter of a stem is facilitated via rays. Rays are horizontal rows of long-living parenchyma cells that arise out of the vascular cambium.

===== Phloem =====
Phloem consists of:
* Sieve tube
* Companion cell
* Phloem fiber
* Phloem parenchyma.

Phloem is an equally important plant tissue as it also is part of the &#x27;plumbing system&#x27; of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve-tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve-tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike vessel members in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous connections are called sieve plates. In spite of the fact that their cytoplasm is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do not have nuclei at maturity. It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called callose, a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the sieve plate. Callose stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure. Phloem transports food and materials in plants upwards and downwards as required.

==Animal tissue==
Animal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Collections of tissues joined in units to serve a common function compose organs. While most animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals. Tissue appeared for the first time in the diploblasts, but modern forms only appeared in triploblasts.

The epithelium in all animals is derived from the ectoderm and endoderm (or their precursor in sponges), with a small contribution from the mesoderm, forming the endothelium, a specialized type of epithelium that composes the vasculature. By contrast, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions, to create a selectively permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come in contact with the external environment such as the skin, the airways, and the digestive tract. It serves functions of protection, secretion, and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a basal lamina.

The connective tissue and the muscular are derived from the mesoderm. The nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm.

===Epithelial tissues===
The epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces, such as the surface of skin, the airways, surfaces of soft organs, the reproductive tract, and the inner lining of the digestive tract. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue may also be specialized to function in secretion, excretion and absorption. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss.

Functions of epithelial tissue:
* The principle function of epithelial tissues are covering and lining of free surface
* The cells of the body&#x27;s surface form the outer layer of skin.
* Inside the body, epithelial cells form the lining of the mouth and alimentary canal and protect these organs.
* Epithelial tissues help in the elimination of waste.
* Epithelial tissues secrete enzymes and/or hormones in the form of glands.
* Some epithelial tissue perform secretory functions. They secrete a variety of substances including sweat, saliva, mucus, enzymes.

There are many kinds of epithelium, and nomenclature is somewhat variable. Most classification schemes combine a description of the cell-shape in the upper layer of the epithelium with a word denoting the number of layers: either simple (one layer of cells) or stratified (multiple layers of cells). However, other cellular features such as cilia may also be described in the classification system. Some common kinds of epithelium are listed below:
* Simple squamous (pavement) epithelium
* Simple cuboidal epithelium
* Simple Columnar epithelium
* Simple ciliated (pseudostratified) columnar epithelium
* Simple glandular columnar epithelium
* Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium
* Stratified keratinized epithelium
* Stratified transitional epithelium

===Connective tissue===
Connective tissues are made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone&#x27;s matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose, and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue.

===Muscle tissue===

Muscle cells (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood through the body.

===Nervous tissue===
Cells comprising the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system are classified as nervous (or neural) tissue. In the central nervous system, neural tissues form the brain and spinal cord. In the peripheral nervous system, neural tissues form the cranial nerves and spinal nerves, inclusive of the motor neurons.

=== Mineralized tissues ===
Mineralized tissues are biological tissues that incorporate minerals into soft matrices. Such tissues may be found in both plants and animals.

== History ==

Xavier Bichat introduced the word &quot;tissue&quot; into the study of anatomy by 1801. He was &quot;the first to propose that tissue is a central element in human anatomy, and he considered organs as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves&quot;. Although he worked without a microscope, Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed, a number later reduced by other authors.

<text>The British Wool Marketing Board (also now known as British Wool) operates the central marketing system for UK fleece wool. A farmer-run organisation, British Wool was established in 1950 with the aim of achieving the best possible net return for producers. It is the only organisation in the world that collects, grades, sells and promotes fleece wool and is the only remaining agricultural commodity board in the UK. 

Receiving no financial support, although operating commercially. British Wool is a non-profit-making organisation, returning to producers the market price for their wool, with its own costs deducted.

== Organisational structure ==
British Wool is required to register all producers with four or more sheep with the exception of producers in Shetland, which has its own arrangement by selling through a cooperative. This system was developed after the Second World War, when farmers were trying to sell their wool on an open market. The system was described as being &quot;chaotic and discriminatory&quot;. According to British Wool, there were between 40,000 and 46,000 registered producers in 2015. The number of producers has been falling; in 1995 it was 91,000, by 2012 it was 75,000. This has also been in line with the number of sheep available; in 1990 there were 65 million sheep for wool farming, by 2012 this had fallen to 40 million.

British Wool collects, grades and auctions all types of British sheep wool on behalf of British sheep farmers.

The board of nine elected producer members, representing nine different areas of the UK, and two government appointees, meet eight times a year and report back to nine regionally elected committees.

Day-to-day operations are run from British Wool&#x27;s headquarters in Bradford, West Yorkshire with smaller offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Wool fleeces are graded at one of the eight grading centres that they operate before being sent to auctions which are held approx. 18 times per year.

== Industry in Decline, further impaired by Covid-19 ==
The growth in use of synthetic fibres, coupled with the introduction of US imports and fewer players in the wool industry’s supply chain have led to the regression, since the 1950s, of the British wool industry and its products popularity. The global wool market was forced to shut in February 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which made it impossible to sell all of the years produced crop. As a result, extensive amounts of unsold wool are stored in depots, causing prices of wool to plummet. A 14 million kg backlog is waiting to be cleared by the board, while the average price per kg has virtually halved from the previous year’s 60p to 32p. Further reasons for current decline in wool prices are Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war.

The situation had dramatic effects for sheep farmers across the UK. Farmers lost money through selling their product, as the costs that came with shearing and selling the wool outweighed any profits. Particularly for remote farms, where the asking price for wool was worth less than transportation and fuel costs to the given British Wool depots. Many farmers were forced to discard their wool by storing it away, composting, or through more dramatic methods such as burning. This left farmers only having to cover shearing expenses, as it is still necessary to sheer the sheep for their health and well-being (so they do not suffer from blowfly strike, which causes maggots). The wool predicament leads to the farmers growing concern about the British Wool Board policy. Some farmers feeling the organisation has been too focused on the Chinese market and missed out on establishing connections with substitute markets, alternative supply chains and creating more consumer demand.

<text>British Waterways, often shortened to BW, was a statutory corporation wholly owned by the government of the United Kingdom. It served as the navigation authority for the majority of canals and a number of rivers and docks in England, Scotland and Wales.

On 2 July 2012, all of British Waterways&#x27; assets and responsibilities in England and Wales were transferred to the newly founded charity the Canal &amp; River Trust. In Scotland, British Waterways continues to operate as a standalone public corporation under the trading name Scottish Canals.

The British Waterways Board was initially established as a result of the Transport Act 1962 and took control of the inland waterways assets of the British Transport Commission in 1963. By the final years of its existence, British Waterways was sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in England and Wales, and by the Scottish Government in Scotland.

British Waterways managed and maintained of canals, rivers and docks within the United Kingdom including the buildings, structures and landscapes alongside these waterways. Half of the United Kingdom population lives within five miles of a canal or river once managed by British Waterways. In addition to the watercourses, British Waterways also cared for and owned 2,555 listed structures including seventy scheduled monuments. A further 800 areas have special designation and a further hundred are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).

Through its charitable arm The Waterways Trust, British Waterways maintained a museum of its history at the National Waterways Museum&#x27;s three sites at Gloucester Docks, Stoke Bruerne and Ellesmere Port. Since the transfer of the assets and responsibilities of British Waterways to the Canal &amp; River Trust, The Waterways Trust in England and Wales has merged with the Canal &amp; River Trust. It continues, however, as an independent charity in Scotland.

==History==


===Formation===
During the early 20th century, the canal network was in decline because of increasing competition from the railways and road transport. Until the 1950s, freight and other cargo was still carried on the canals, by then owned by the railway companies. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, the canals they owned were also incorporated into the new British Transport Commission. The Commission focused on encouraging commercial traffic to the waterways, but with the construction of motorways in the 1950s, and legislation such as the Clean Air Act 1956 affecting the coal carriers using the waterways, that policy could not be sustained. The last regular coal long-distance narrow-boat-carrying contract, from Atherstone to the Kearley and Tonge jam factory at Southall near London, ended in October 1970, although lime juice continued to be carried by narrow boat from Brentford to Boxmoor until 1981, and aggregate from Thurmaston to Syston from 1976 until 1988.

Under the Transport Act 1962, the British Transport Commission was split into several new organisations, including the British Railways Board and the London Transport Board, with the inland waterways of Britain becoming part of the new British Waterways Board (BWB).

In the same year, a remarkably harsh winter saw many boats frozen into their moorings, unable to move for weeks at a time. That was one of the reasons given for the decision by the BWB to formally cease most of its commercial narrow boat traffic on the canals. By that time, the canal network had shrunk to just , half the size it was at its peak in the early 19th century. However, the basic network was still intact, with many of the closures affecting duplicate routes or branches.

===Transport Act 1968 ===
The Transport Act 1968 classified the nationalised waterways into three distinct categories as specified by BWB:

* Commercial – Waterways that could still support commercial traffic; these were mainly located in the North East of England
* Cruising – Waterways that had a potential for leisure use, such as cruising, fishing and recreational use
* Remainder – Waterways for which no potential commercial or leisure use could be seen.

British Waterways Board was required under the Act to keep commercial and cruising waterways fit for their respective traffic and use. However, these obligations were subject to the caveat of being by the most economical means and BWB had no requirement to maintain remainder waterways or keep them in a navigable condition. As a result, many remainder waterways could face abandonment or transference to the local authority who would contribute to the waterway&#x27;s upkeep as part of the act. Additionally, many of these remainder waterways were crossed by new roads and motorways without provision for boat navigation.

===Late 20th century===
As the century progressed, leisure boating on the canals began to expand, with numbers reaching 20,000 by the early 1980s. Additionally, the work of voluntary restoration groups succeeded in restoring some waterways to their former condition. However, despite this steady progress throughout the 1970s and 1980s, organisations such as English Heritage criticised the newly named British Waterways for failing to provide &quot;adequate training or access to professional advice [for British Waterways officers] on the conservation of historic structures&quot;.

However, by the late 1990s the canal network and British Waterways were flourishing; revenues generated for canal maintenance reached £100 million for the first time in 1998, large grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund allowed the canal network to expand again by restoring former canals and additional funding was announced for British Waterways in 1999 by the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. By the early 2000s, boating numbers had overtaken the previous industrial revolution high and the canal network was officially classed as &#x27;safe&#x27; following the completion of all outstanding safety works.

===Abolition===
By 2009, British Waterways was looking for a means of gaining a larger and more secure supply of funding in order to plug a £30m shortfall in its budget, while utilising the potential for volunteers on the waterways, allowing the waterways community to play a greater role. Its plans involved moving to become a charitable trust, in charge of the current canal systems in addition to acquiring other waterways, such as those operated by the Environment Agency.

In March 2010, the plans were given a boost when the government announced in the Budget that it intended to turn BW into a mutual organisation, but no further details were released. BW welcomed the announcement, with the chairman Tony Hales stating that the plan would preserve the canals and their associated infrastructure, and &quot;safeguard against a return to the decline and dereliction which they faced in the last century&quot;. It would also &quot;unlock the enormous public support that there is for them.&quot;

By September of the same year, the proposals seemed likely to be enacted; a leaked list of quangos that were due to be abolished was acquired by the BBC, including British Waterways, with the note: &quot;Abolish as a non-departmental public body and mutualise&quot;. The following month saw an official announcement from British Waterways confirming the leaked list, and that a new charity would be established to tend the of canals and rivers in England and Wales cared for by British Waterways.

The new name, the Canal &amp; River Trust, and logo were revealed in October 2011, and the trust was granted charitable status on 5 April 2012. On 2 July 2012 all of British Waterways&#x27; responsibilities for waterways in England and Wales were transferred to the Canal &amp; River Trust. The Scottish Government, however, decided that the waterways in Scotland would not be part of the new charity, and that British Waterways Scotland would remain a state-owned entity, operating as Scottish Canals.

==Organisation==

British Waterways operated from headquarters in Watford, with additional administrative offices in Leeds and thirteen regional waterway offices.

At the strategic level, there were ten non-executive board members, who were led by the chairman (in the final phase of operations, Tony Hales), and appointed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Scottish Government (eight by the former and two by the latter). In addition, there were nine executive directors led by Robin Evans, the Chief Executive.

At a regional level, British Waterways was divided into thirteen regional waterways; each appointed a waterways manager. These regions were: 
*Scotland (Highlands)
*Scotland (Lowlands)
*North West Waterways
*North East Waterways
*Manchester and Pennine Waterways
*North Wales and Borders Waterways
*West Midlands Waterways
*Central Shires Waterways
*East Midlands Waterways
*South Wales and Severn Waterways
*South East Waterways
*Kennet and Avon Waterways
*London Waterways

==Finance==
British Waterways was funded through a mixture of commercial activities, government grants and grants and donations from charitable bodies. In 2010/11, BW raised over £103.6 million from their commercial activities, including waterways licensing, received £58.9 million from a government grant, issued via the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and gained a further £14 million through third party contributions. However, operating revenue for the company was at a deficit of £3.7 million, a result of a large cut of 16 per cent in the government grant given to BW, and through the continuing programme of renovation and works costing £92.1 million.

British Waterways owned a large canalside property portfolio which made a considerable contribution to the funding of the waterway network. This amounted to £130m in the five years prior to 2008. As of 2008, a HM Treasury team was reviewing the management of this portfolio in terms of public sector savings and efficiencies. Another source of revenue contemplated by BW in October 2008 was the installation of 50 wind turbines on waterside land, generating around 100 megawatts.

==Waterscape==
As part of British Waterways&#x27; commitment to promote the canals to users other than boaters, BW set up the Waterscape website in 2003 to be an official information and leisure resource for UK inland waterways. The website worked alongside the Environment Agency and the Broads Authority and covered all canals, rivers and waterways in England, Scotland and Wales.

The Waterscape website was taken down on 3 July 2012 and was replaced by the new website of the Canal &amp; River Trust.

<text>Punky Brewster is an American sitcom television series about a young girl (Soleil Moon Frye) being raised by a foster parent (George Gaynes) in Chicago. The show ran on NBC from September 16, 1984, to March 9, 1986, and again in syndication from October 30, 1987, to May 27, 1988.

&quot;Punky Brewster&quot; spawned an animated spin-off, &quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot;. The series featured the original cast voicing their respective characters. The cartoon was produced by Ruby-Spears, and aired on NBC from September 14, 1985, to December 6, 1986.

In 2020, NBC confirmed a 10-episode revival to air on its Peacock streaming service. Frye returned, as did original cast member Cherie Johnson. The revival premiered on February 25, 2021.

==Synopsis==
Penelope &quot;Punky&quot; Brewster (Soleil Moon Frye) is a warm, funny, and bright child. Her father walked out on her family, then her mother abandoned her at a Chicago shopping center when they were shopping for groceries, leaving Punky alone with her dog, Brandon. Afterwards, Punky discovers a vacant apartment in a local building.

The building is managed by 60-year-old Henry Warnimont (George Gaynes), a widowed photographer with a grouchy streak who finds Punky in the abandoned apartment. Punky hits it off with young Cherie Johnson (played by Cherie Johnson), who lives in Henry&#x27;s building with her grandmother, Betty (Susie Garrett). Betty works as a registered nurse at Cook County Hospital. Henry discovers Punky in the empty apartment across from his. Punky explains things to him and he decides to take Punky in.

The relationship between the two blossoms, despite red tape from social worker Randi Mitchell (Talia Balsam), who ultimately rallies to Henry&#x27;s side. The state forces Punky to stay at Fenster Hall, an emergency shelter for orphaned and abandoned children, until their day in court. The court approves Henry&#x27;s wish to become Punky&#x27;s foster father. Henry legally adopts her in the second season.

Punky&#x27;s other friends are geeky Allen Anderson (Casey Ellison) and spoiled rich girl Margaux Kramer (Ami Foster). During the NBC run, Punky&#x27;s teachers were regularly seen, in the first season, cheerful Mrs. Morton (Dody Goodman) and in the second season, hip Mike Fulton (T. K. Carter). Mike formed a close relationship with Punky and her friends, and was also portrayed as a social crusader of sorts.

===Season 1 (1984–1985)===
During the first season, Margaux&#x27;s socialite mother (Loyita Chapel) appeared on a recurring basis, as did kooky maintenance man Eddie Malvin (Eddie Deezen). Eddie disappeared after the first several episodes.

Beginning in 1984, NBC aired the sitcom on Sundays. Because the show had many young viewers and was scheduled after football games (which tended to run long), six fifteen-minute episodes were produced. This was done rather than joining a full-length episode in progress, so as not to disappoint children watching the program.

===Season 2 (1985–1986)===
The second season&#x27;s February 2, 1986, episode introduced the first installment of a five-part storyline. In the five-part episode &quot;Changes&quot;, Henry&#x27;s downtown photography studio was destroyed in a fire, and for a time, he seemingly would not be able to recover from the aftermath and resume his career. As a result of his stress, Henry ended up hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer.

During that time, Betty and Cherie made arrangements for Punky to stay with them until Henry recovered. Everyone&#x27;s stability was halted when bureaucratic social worker Simon P. Chillings (guest star Timothy Stack) showed up, found out about Henry&#x27;s condition, and deemed the worst; he found Betty unsuitable to care for Punky because Punky would not have her own room. Chillings also felt that Henry was unfit to be Punky&#x27;s legal guardian in the long term due to his health, age, and uncertain financial future. Chillings made Punky a ward of the state yet again, and she returned to Fenster Hall.

Punky&#x27;s efforts to escape from Fenster included a trick pulled by Margaux, in which she dressed up and pretended to be Punky. Despite advocacy from Mike Fulton, Chillings placed Punky with a new foster family, the fabulously wealthy Jules and Tiffany Buckworth (Robert Casper and Joan Welles), the latter of whom did not take kindly at all to Punky&#x27;s working-class playfulness. Things gradually returned to normal. Henry, back on his feet following surgery, opened up a glitzy new studio at the local mall; in the process, he reunited with Punky. At the conclusion of the story arc, Henry officially adopted Punky.

The final episode of the second season was notable for centering on the very recent, real-life Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. Punky and her classmates watched the live coverage of the shuttle launch in Mike Fulton&#x27;s class. After the accident occurred, Punky is traumatized; her dreams of becoming an astronaut are crushed. Her teacher Mike then brings over former NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin to visit Punky. NBC cancelled the show soon after.

===Syndication (1987–1988)===
After two seasons, NBC saw that &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; and its principal Sunday night stablemate, the four-year-old &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, could not compete as strongly as they hoped against CBS&#x27; juggernaut &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, and cancelled both programs. Like many cult-favorite sitcoms of the time, &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; was revived for syndication (as was &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;). Production on &quot;Punky&quot; went undelayed, and its third season began shooting on schedule. While the show was in production throughout the 1986–87 season, it did not return to the air via syndication until October 30, 1987. Beginning on that premiere date, &quot;Punky&quot; was packaged such that new episodes would air every weekday (usually late in the afternoon on independent stations). The entire third season (1986–87) aired in the five-days-a-week format through December 8, 1987.

By the syndicated run, the storylines had clearly started to mature. Many more of Punky and Cherie&#x27;s friends were seen (although most only made a handful of guest appearances each), with Margaux becoming their comic foil and source of friction. Early in the third season, Allen moved away to Kansas with his mother, following his parents&#x27; divorce. As Punky herself neared junior high, her avant-garde day-glo and multicolored attire, along with her pigtails, segued into more traditional teenaged styles, and her declaration of, and reliance on &quot;Punky Power!&quot; gave way to the realization that intelligence, common sense, and a strong will, can get one out of any problem. More of her dalliances with boys entered the stories, with the ones she chased and those that tried to pursue her. Punky&#x27;s spunk and vivacious attitude toward life did remain, though, thanks in part to the sunshine brought in by the most important man in her life, her adoptive dad.

Henry&#x27;s photography studio at the mall continued to see much success, so much that by the end of the third season, he received an offer from the magnate of Glossy&#x27;s, a photo-studio franchise, for a $100,000 buyout of Warnimont&#x27;s, which also included the offer of Henry becoming manager of the Glossy&#x27;s location. Henry accepted, but soon found that his creativity and business style were not being appreciated by his new employers. He quit Glossy&#x27;s, but then decided to give into Punky and Cherie&#x27;s dream to run their own teen hangout/burger establishment, and invested into another mall property, which ended up being splashed with as much color and originality as Punky&#x27;s bedroom. All involved, which even included Betty and Margaux, unanimously decided on christening it &quot;Punky&#x27;s Place&quot;. Into season four, much of the action continued to take place at the mall, with Henry, Punky, and her friends&#x27; efforts to keep their new restaurant afloat and the many teenage misadventures which passed through at Punky&#x27;s Place.

From December 10, 1987 to April 26, 1988, reruns from the third season were added to the &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; syndication package. On April 27, 1988, new episodes resumed for the fourth season, and ran every weekday for a month until the series finale aired on May 27, 1988.

The final episode, &quot;Wedding Bells for Brandon&quot;, features Brandon falling in love with Brenda, a golden retriever that belonged to one of Henry and Punky&#x27;s neighbors. Their whirlwind romance culminated in a wedding ceremony in the courtyard, which was attended mostly by other neighborhood canines.

According to Cherie Johnson, &quot;Wedding Bells for Brandon&quot; was not intended to be the series finale; that particular episode came along in the midst of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.

===Revival (2021)===
In June 2019, UCP announced plans for a new &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; series starring Soleil Moon Frye. The series revisits Punky as a single mother of three “trying to get her life back on track when she meets a young girl who reminds her a lot of her younger self.” The series also features Cherie Johnson, returning to the role named after her, as well as Freddie Prinze Jr. as Punky&#x27;s ex-husband. In early 2020, NBC confirmed the revival consisting of a ten-episode first season that will air on its new streaming Peacock network. The revival premiered on February 25, 2021. In August 2021, the series was canceled after one season.

==Production notes==
The show was produced by Lightkeeper Productions, and NBC Productions during the network run. NBC was not allowed to co-produce the series when it moved into syndication, due to then-existing FCC regulations regarding network involvement in syndicated TV programming. Thus, they made a syndication deal with Coca-Cola Telecommunications to co-produce two more seasons of episodes, plus U.S. syndication rights to the NBC-era episodes. Thus, Sony Pictures Television holds the domestic television rights, while NBCUniversal Syndication Studios holds international television and worldwide home video &amp; streaming rights. Additionally, MGM Television also holds international television broadcast rights with NBCUniversal, part of the pre-2004 NBC Studios library.

Reruns of the series were broadcast in the United States on The Family Channel from October 3, 1993, to September 20, 1996.

===Theme song===
The theme song for &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; is &quot;Every Time I Turn Around,&quot; written by Gary Portnoy and Judy Hart Angelo and sung by Portnoy.

===Origin of the name===
NBC programming chief Brandon Tartikoff named the series after a girl he had a crush on in his own childhood: an older tomboy named Peyton &quot;Punky&quot; Brewster. Before the series aired, NBC tracked her down (by this time, she was married and named Peyton Rutledge) and secured her permission to use her name for the lead character. Rutledge was even hired to do a cameo in one episode as a teacher at Punky&#x27;s school (in the opening scene of the episode titled &quot;The Search&quot;, aired November 10, 1985) so that both the real and fictional Punky Brewster could be on-screen at the same time (the teacher even comments &quot;Punky Brewster? Strange name!&quot;). She is credited at the end of the episode as Peyton B. Rutledge.

Punky&#x27;s dog is named Brandon, after Tartikoff himself. The dog&#x27;s real name was Sandy. Sandy originally shared the role with his brother, but Tartikoff decided that Sandy was better for the role.

==Home media==
All four seasons have been released on DVD in Region 1 by Shout! Factory, as well as separate discs that consist of six to eight episodes of the series. All season releases also contain episodes of the spin-off cartoon, &quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot;.

Mill Creek Entertainment also released three &quot;Best-of&quot; collections of the series.

In Region 4, Umbrella Entertainment has released the first two seasons on DVD in Australia. These releases do not contain episodes of the animated &quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot;.

==Spin-offs==

===&quot;Fenster Hall&quot;===
The final episode in Season 1, titled &quot;Fenster Hall&quot; (aired March 31, 1985), was a failed attempt to create a spin-off of &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;. It was a one-hour episode, but was cut into two shows for syndication. This crossover episode marked the debut of Mike Fulton; T. K. Carter was the intended star of the &quot;Fenster Hall&quot; spin-off. Mike&#x27;s history as a longtime resident of Fenster was explained, since he had been an orphan from birth and had been shuffled around to many foster homes before permanently staying at Fenster from the time he was seven. Now as the chief boys&#x27; counselor, Mike was saddled with helping new, tough street kid T.C. Finestra (Billy Lombardo) fit in with his group of regular charges, after an incident in which T.C. broke into and stole from the bedroom of Punky Brewster. Punky had a confrontation with T.C. after following him to a shady lair kept by street thug Blade (James LeGros), who had taken T.C. under his wing and was teaching him how to rob. It was there in which Punky learned of T.C.&#x27;s situation, and brought him home to Henry before it was decided that he would be better off at Fenster.

The primary focus of the episode was on Mike and T.C.&#x27;s learning to trust and look out for each other, while many other denizens of Fenster were introduced who would have also comprised the cast of the spin-off. Mike&#x27;s boss was Rita J. Sanchez (Rosanna DeSoto), and his other boys, who he treated as if they were his own sons, were aspiring heavyweight boxer Lester &quot;Sugar&quot; Thompson (Martin Davis), sweet little Dash (Benji Gregory), nerdy intellectual Lyle (Gabriel Damon), who supposedly did Mike&#x27;s tax forms for him; and huge, hulking Conan (B.J. Barie). When &quot;Fenster Hall&quot; did not transpire as a regular series by the time of NBC&#x27;s 1985–86 upfronts, T.K. Carter then continued his role as Mike Fulton on &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; the following season, now serving as Punky&#x27;s fourth grade teacher.

===&quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot;===
&quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster!&quot;, an animated spin-off with the original cast, appeared on NBC on Saturday mornings. The cartoon was produced by Ruby-Spears. It ran from September 14, 1985, to December 6, 1986, for a total of 26 episodes. However, through reruns, it remained in the regular Saturday-morning lineup through the 1988–89 season. The series was later syndicated by Claster Television as part of a package featuring the DIC series &quot;Maxie&#x27;s World&quot; (the &quot;lead&quot; program), and &quot;Beverly Hills Teens&quot;.

<text>WWT Caerlaverock is wetland nature reserve in southwest Scotland, one of ten reserves in Britain operated by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust founded by Sir Peter Scott.

It covers a site at Eastpark Farm, on the north shore of the Solway Firth to the south of Dumfries. It is a wild nature reserve with a network of screened approaches and several observation towers. There is a visitor centre. The site received 16,105 visitors in 2019.

Caerlaverock is home to one of only two UK populations of the &quot;living fossil&quot; &quot;Triops cancriformis&quot;, the horseshoe shrimp. It is also home to the UK&#x27;s most northerly population of the natterjack toad.

Almost the entire Svalbard population of barnacle goose overwinters in the Solway Firth area, with many of the birds often at Caerlaverock for part or all of the winter; their protection by the reserve has enabled the population to recover from just 500 birds in the 1940s, to over 25,000 now.
 In 2016 the peak count on the reserve was 15,980 in October. Other high counts of wildfowl that year included 221 whooper swan, 2,457 Northern pintail, 3,000 Eurasian teal, 1,230 Eurasian wigeon and 150 greater scaup. These numbers attract raptors such as peregrine falcon, common buzzard and hen harrier. Vagrant birds recorded on the reserve include common crane, long-billed dowitcher, red-breasted goose, snow goose, ring-necked duck and white-tailed plover.

In January 2002, a new education centre was officially opened by King Harald V of Norway.

A pair of ospreys have nested on the reserve since 2005. Their nest can be observed by webcam through the reserve&#x27;s web-site during the day in the nesting season (April–August). At other times the webcam shows the whooper pond or a barn owl nest.

<doc id="103930" wikidata="Q287805" url="?curid=103930" title="Soleil Moon Frye">
<text>Soleil Moon Frye (; born August 6, 1976) is an American actress, director, producer, and screenwriter. She began her career as a child actress at the age of two. When she was seven, Frye won the role of Penelope &quot;Punky&quot; Brewster in the NBC sitcom &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;. The series debuted in September 1984 and earned consistently low ratings, but the Punky character was a hit with young children. After NBC cancelled the series, it was picked up for the syndication market where it aired for an additional two seasons before ending in 1988. Frye reprised the role in a 2021 revival of the series, which was cancelled after one season.

After the original Punky Brewster series ended, Frye continued her career in guest spots on television and supporting roles in films. She attended The New School during the late 1990s and directed her first film, &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, in 1998. In 2000, she joined the cast in The WB sitcom &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; as Roxie King, Sabrina Spellman&#x27;s roommate and close friend. Frye remained with the series until its end in April 2003. She has since continued her acting career working mainly as a voice actor where she is best known for voicing Zoey Howzer in the Proud Family franchise.

In 1998, Frye married producer Jason Goldberg with whom she has four children. She has since opened an eco-friendly specialty clothing boutique for children, The Little Seed, in Los Angeles. She also hosts a blog and web series that focus on child rearing and women&#x27;s issues. In 2011, Frye released her first book, &quot;Happy Chaos: From Punky to Parenting and My Perfectly Imperfect Adventures in Between&quot;.
Frye was host of the &quot;Home Made Simple&quot; show on the Oprah Winfrey Network from 2013 to 2014.

==Early life==
Frye was born in Glendora, California. Her father was actor Virgil Frye (1930–2012), and her mother is talent agent and caterer Sondra Peluce (née Londy). She has two half-brothers, Sean Frye and Meeno Peluce, both former child actors. Frye&#x27;s parents divorced when she was two. She was raised in her mother&#x27;s Jewish faith.

Frye was educated at a private school in Los Feliz and attended San Fernando Valley Professional School in Burbank.

==Career==

===Acting===
Frye made her acting debut in the 1982 television movie &quot;Missing Children: A Mother&#x27;s Story&quot;. In 1983, she had a supporting role in &quot;Who Will Love My Children?&quot;, another television movie starring Ann-Margret. The following year, she portrayed Elizabeth (Bette) Kovacs in the biographical television movie &quot;Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter&quot;, and appeared in another television movie, &quot;Invitation to Hell&quot;, directed by Wes Craven.

At an audition in 1984, Frye beat out over 3,000 girls (including her future &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; co-star Melissa Joan Hart) to win the titular role on the NBC sitcom &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;. The series, which was conceived by NBC&#x27;s then-head of programming Brandon Tartikoff, premiered in September 1984. Scheduled opposite CBS&#x27;s highly rated &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, the series struggled in the ratings, but the character of Punky was popular among children. Frye routinely appeared at parades, participated in an anti-drug walks with then-First Lady Nancy Reagan, and was the honorary chairman for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Frye also voiced and reprised the role in the animated series &quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot;, which began airing during Punky Brewster&#x27;s first season. Despite the series&#x27; low ratings, Brandon Tartikoff decided to renew the show for a second season because it was the highest rated show watched by children 2 to 11 years old. &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;&#x27;s second season, which dealt with more serious subject matters such as CPR and first-aid training, drug use and the Just Say No campaign, and the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, did not improve ratings, and NBC cancelled the series in April 1986. The series was quickly picked up by Columbia Pictures Television and began airing in first-run syndication. &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; aired for an additional two seasons, ending on May 27, 1988.

Immediately upon &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;&#x27;s end, Frye landed the lead role in the ABC sitcom pilot &quot;Cadets&quot;, which aired as a summer special on September 25, 1988. The pilot, however, was not picked up. In 1989, Frye hosted the syndicated weekly talk/variety show &quot;Girl Talk&quot;. Based on the board game of the same name, Frye shared hosting duties with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Rod Brogan. The series was cancelled after one season. In 1990, she appeared in the Rodney Dangerfield sitcom pilot &quot;...Where&#x27;s Rodney?&quot;, but this was not picked up as a series, either.

During the 1990s, Frye guest-starred on several television series, including &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, and &quot;Friends&quot;, and voiced characters for the animated series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, and &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; (namely, the &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; pilot episode). In addition to her television work, Frye has appeared in the films &quot;The Liars&#x27; Club&quot; (1993) and &quot;Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings&quot; (1995) and in stage productions of &quot;Orestes, I Murdered My Mother&quot; and &quot;The Housekeeper&quot;.

From 2000 to 2003, Frye played the character of Roxie King in the last few seasons of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;, with her longtime friend and series producer Melissa Joan Hart. During the run of &quot;Sabrina&quot;, she voiced Zoey Howzer in the Disney Channel series &quot;The Proud Family&quot; and the series&#x27; 2005 television movie. She reprised the role in the revival series &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot;.

In 2005, she voiced Jade, a Bratz character in the direct-to-video release &quot;Bratz Rock Angelz&quot;. She also voiced the character for the television series, and the video games &quot;Bratz Rock Angelz&quot; (2005), &quot;Bratz: Forever Diamondz&quot; (2006), and Bratz: The Movie (2007) and the follow-up movies until &quot;Bratz: Fashion 4 Passion - Diamondz&quot;. From 2010 to February 2013, Frye voiced Aseefa in the animated series &quot;Planet Sheen&quot;.

She appears in the &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; reboot that began airing on Peacock on February 25, 2021.

===Directing===
In 1996, Frye moved to New York to attend The New School and later directed her first film, &quot;Wild Horses&quot; (1998).

Frye directed her second film, &quot;Sonny Boy&quot;, in 2004. The documentary chronicles a two-week trip Frye took with her father, Virgil, who had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; was an official selection at the 27th Starz Denver International Film Festival and won Best Documentary at the San Diego Film Festival.

In 2021, Frye directed &quot;Kid 90&quot;, a documentary film using an archive of footage she shot in the 1990s, for which Leonardo DiCaprio was executive producer. The film was released on March 12, 2021, by Hulu.

===Other ventures===
In 2007, Frye, along with two friends, opened The Little Seed, an eco-friendly children&#x27;s specialty boutique in Los Angeles. The boutique closed in August 2012, and is now an Internet-based business.

In March 2010, Frye and her friend and former co-star Melissa Joan Hart launched the &quot;Better Together&quot; campaign for Gain.

In September 2011, Frye released her first book, &quot;Happy Chaos: From Punky to Parenting and My Perfectly Imperfect Adventures in Between&quot;. In October 2013, she released a party-planning book, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get This Party Started&quot;. She also hosted a web series, &quot;Her Say&quot;, from 2011 to 2012, and currently hosts a blog on her official website, moonfrye.com, both of which deal with women&#x27;s issues and parenting.

In 2014, Frye co-founded P.S. XO, a company that sells party decoration kits. The name was then changed to MoonFrye, and expanded to include DIY kits for families and an app of the same name. They later merged with the company Seedling, which specializes in &quot;activity kits&quot;.

==Personal life==
As a teen, Frye suffered from gigantomastia. She underwent a breast reduction three months before her 16th birthday.

In the 1990s, Frye was romantically involved with hip-hop artist Danny Boy O&#x27;Connor, with whom she remains friends.

On October 25, 1998, Frye married television producer Jason Goldberg in a Jewish ceremony (Frye&#x27;s mother is Jewish, as is Goldberg). Frye and Goldberg have four children: daughters born in August 2005 and March 2008 and sons born in February 2014 and May 2016. Goldberg and Frye renewed their marriage vows in a ceremony in 2008. However, in 2020, after 22 years of marriage, the couple separated. In December 2020, Frye filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized in April 2022.

In 2022, Frye was dating childhood friend Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town.

<doc id="103938" wikidata="Q762439" url="?curid=103938" title="William Cavendish (courtier)">
<text>Sir William Cavendish MP (c. 150525 October 1557) was an English politician, knight and courtier. Cavendish held public office and accumulated a considerable fortune, and became one of Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s &quot;visitors of the monasteries&quot; during the dissolution of the monasteries. He was MP for Thirsk in 1547. In 1547 he married Bess of Hardwick, and the couple began the construction of Chatsworth House in 1552, a project which would not be completed until after his death. His second son William Cavendish (1552–1626) became the first Earl of Devonshire, purchasing his title from the impecunious King James I.

==Early life==
He was the younger son of Thomas Cavendish (1472–1524), who was a senior financial official, the &quot;Clerk of the Pipe,&quot; in the Court of Exchequer, and his wife, Alice Smith of Padbrook Hall. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Sir John Cavendish from whom the Dukes of Devonshire and the Dukes of Newcastle inherited the family name of Cavendish.

==Career==
Cavendish became one of Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s &quot;visitors of the monasteries&quot; when King Henry VIII annexed the property of the Catholic Church at the end of the 1530s, in the dissolution of the monasteries. This followed from his successful career as a financial expert holding public office in the Exchequer, which led to his wealth. He was accused of accumulating extra riches unfairly during the dissolution. After Cromwell&#x27;s fall, he was sent to Ireland to survey and value lands which had fallen to the English during the FitzGerald Rebellion.

He was connected to the Seymour brothers Edward and Thomas, and via them to the family of Jane Grey, but he also took care to send tokens of goodwill to the Lady Mary. He was appointed Treasurer of the Chamber from 1546 to 1553 but, after an audit, was accused of embezzling a significant amount of money. Only his death saved the family from disgrace.

During the reign of Mary I, a favourable biography of Thomas Wolsey was first published, written from the perspective of one of his closest aides, the one who had taken King Henry news of Wolsey&#x27;s death. Although for centuries Sir William was said to be its author, historians now attribute it to his older brother George Cavendish (1494–1562).

==Family==
William Cavendish had a total of 16 children by three different wives. His first wife was Margaret Bostock; they had five children, but only three daughters survived:
* Catherine, who married Thomas Brooke, son of Lord Cobham
* Mary (died after 1547) 
* Ann, who married Sir Henry Boynton in 1561, the son of Edward Bayntun and Isabel Leigh, Lady Bayntun, the half-sister of Queen Katherine Howard
* Margaret, died in 1540

In 1542, he was married to Elizabeth Parker; she had three children, none of whom survived. She died after giving birth to a stillborn daughter in 1546.

In 1547, he married Bess of Hardwick. He sold his property in Suffolk and moved to Bess&#x27;s native county of Derbyshire. He purchased the Chatsworth estate in 1549 and the couple began to build Chatsworth House in 1552.

In the ten years before he died, they had eight children, six of whom survived infancy: 
* Frances Cavendish (1548–1632), married Henry Pierrepont
* Henry Cavendish (1550–1616), eldest son, Knight of the Shire and MP for Derbyshire for over 20 years, eventually disinherited by his mother in favour of his younger brother William (ancestor of the branch of the family holding the title of Baron Waterpark)
* William Cavendish (1552–1626), the first Earl of Devonshire
* Charles Cavendish (1553–1617), father of William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle
* Elizabeth Cavendish (1555–1582), later entered into a controversial marriage with Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox, by whom she was the mother of Arbella Stuart, claimant to the English throne
* Mary Cavendish (1556–1632), married Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. Their daughter Alethea Talbot Howard is an ancestor of the 5th and later Dukes of Norfolk.

<doc id="103939" wikidata="Q157321" url="?curid=103939" title="Francis Picabia">
<text>Francis Picabia (: born Francis-Marie Martinez de Picabia; 22January 1879 – 30November 1953) was a French avant-garde painter, writer, filmmaker, magazine publisher, poet, and typographist closely associated with Dada.

When considering the many styles that Picabia painted in, observers have described his career as &quot;shape-shifting&quot; or &quot;kaleidoscopic&quot;. After experimenting with Impressionism and Pointillism, Picabia became associated with Cubism. His highly abstract planar compositions were colourful and rich in contrasts. He was one of the early major figures of the Dada movement in the United States and in France before denouncing it in 1921. He was later briefly associated with Surrealism, but would soon turn his back on the art establishment. 

==Early life==

Francis Picabia was born in Paris of a French mother and a Cuban father of Spanish descent. Some sources would have his father as of aristocratic Spanish descent, whereas others consider him of non-aristocratic Spanish descent, from the region of Galicia. His birth year of 1879 coincided with the Spanish-Cuban Little War; and though Picabia was born in Paris, his father was involved in Cuban-French relations and would later serve as attaché at the Cuban legation in Paris (see the Treaty of 1898). The family ties to Cuba would be important in Picabia&#x27;s life later on.

The family was affluent, and both parents encouraged Picabia to pursue an art career. Picabia&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis when he was five, and he was raised by his father.

Picabia&#x27;s artistic ability was apparent from his youth. In 1894, he copied a collection of Spanish paintings that belonged to his grandfather, switching the copies for the originals and selling the originals to finance his stamp collection. A lifelong philanderer, Picabia eloped to Switzerland in 1897 with one of his mistresses, causing his father to briefly cut off contact with him.

==Art career==

During the late 1890s, Picabia began to study art under Fernand Cormon and others at École des Arts Decoratifs, Cormon&#x27;s academy at 104 boulevard de Clichy, where Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec had also studied. He studied under Fernand Cormon, Ferdinand Humbert, and Albert Charles Wallet for two years. From the age of twenty, Picabia lived by painting. Subsequently, he inherited money from his mother, leaving him far wealthier than most of his contemporaries in the art world. He began buying at least one new sports car each year, and ultimately owned 127 over the course of his life.

Early in his career, from 1903 to 1908, Picabia was influenced by the Impressionist paintings of Alfred Sisley. His subject matter included small churches, lanes, roofs of Paris, riverbanks, wash houses, and barges. This led critics to question his originality, saying that he copied Sisley, that his cathedrals looked like Monet cathedrals, or that he painted like Signac. He soon came to feel he was working in an outdated style and began to look for a new approach.

From 1909, his style changed as he came under the influence of a group of artists soon to be called Cubists. These artists would later form the Golden Section (Section d&#x27;Or). The same year, Picabia married Gabrielle Buffet. (They would divorce in 1930.)

Around 1911 Picabia joined the Puteaux Group, whose members he had met at the studio of Jacques Villon in Puteaux, a commune in the western suburbs of Paris. There he became friends with artist Marcel Duchamp and close friends with Guillaume Apollinaire. Other group members included Albert Gleizes, Roger de La Fresnaye, Fernand Léger and Jean Metzinger.

===Proto-Dada===
In 1913, the Association of American Painters and Sculptors held the first major show of modernist art in New York City, which would become known as the Armory Show. The wealthy Picabia was the only member of the Cubist group to personally attend the Armory Show, as the others could not afford to do so, and he also contributed four paintings. The American press was largely hostile to the show, describing it as bizarre or deviant, but Picabia was widely interviewed and discussed as the only representative of the movement available. He immediately became a major name in New York&#x27;s artistic circles. 

Avant-garde art dealer Alfred Stieglitz also gave Picabia a solo show, &quot;Exhibition of New York studies by Francis Picabia&quot;, at his gallery 291 (formerly &quot;Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession&quot;), 17 March – 5 April 1913. There, Picabia displayed work that he had created in the past few months in New York. Influenced by abstract art from the Armory Show such as that of Wassily Kandinsky, he was now creating abstract works of his own. When he returned to Paris in April 1913, he formally broke with the Cubists.

From 1913 to 1915 Picabia traveled to New York City several times. During that same era, France became embroiled in war. In 1915, Picabia again traveled to the United States en route to Cuba to buy molasses for a friend of his—the director of a sugar refinery. He landed in NewYork in June 1915. Though the stopover was ostensibly meant to be a simple port of call, he decided to remain there for a while to continue working on his art. He did not return to France until the war&#x27;s conclusion.

The following years can be characterized as Picabia&#x27;s proto-Dada or &quot;machinist&quot; period, consisting mainly of his &quot;portraits mécaniques&quot;. Picabia was first impressed by mechanical advances on his initial, 1913 visit to New York, and on returning to Europe, he was impressed by futurist painters such as Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov. Picabia was particularly influenced by the &quot;machine style&quot; of Marcel Duchamp, in which the artist used materials such as metal and glass as well as mechanical drawing implements. In 1915, Picabia began to create and exhibit his own drawings and prints of mysterious machines and apparatuses to reflect the coming of &quot;the age of machines&quot;. He continued in this style for almost a decade, exhibiting a large solo show of his machinist work in 1922. In 1923, he abruptly discontinued his work in the style, as he had with several previous styles. 

In this period, the magazine &quot;291&quot; devoted an entire issue to him, he met Man Ray, Gabrielle and Duchamp joined him, drugs and alcohol became a problem and his health declined. He suffered from dropsy and tachycardia.

===Manifesto===

Later, in 1916, while in Barcelona and within a small circle of refugee artists that included Albert Gleizes and his wife Juliette Roche, Marie Laurencin, Olga Sacharoff, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, he started his Dada periodical &quot;391&quot; (published by Galeries Dalmau), modeled on Stieglitz&#x27;s own periodical. He continued the periodical with the help of Marcel Duchamp in the United States. In Zürich, seeking treatment for depression and suicidal impulses, he had met Tristan Tzara, whose radical ideas thrilled Picabia. Back in Paris, and now with his mistress Germaine Everling, he was in the city of &quot;les assises dada&quot; where André Breton, Paul Éluard, Philippe Soupault and Louis Aragon met at Certa, a Basque bar in the Passage de l&#x27;Opera. Picabia, the provocateur, was back home.
Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. (See &quot;Cannibale&quot;, 1921.) He denounced Dada in 1921, and issued a personal attack against Breton in the final issue of &quot;391&quot;, in 1924. The same year, he appeared briefly in the René Clair short film &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot;, which would become one of the most famous surrealist films of the decade.

===Later years===
Reflecting on his break with Dada, Picabia wrote, &quot;If you want to have clean ideas, change them like shirts.&quot; His career would later be remembered in part for his wide range of artistic styles. In 1922, André Breton relaunched &quot;Littérature&quot; magazine with cover images by Picabia, to whom he gave carte blanche for each issue. Picabia drew on religious imagery, erotic iconography, and the iconography of games of chance.

In 1925, Picabia returned to figurative painting, producing a series of dense, garish paintings known as his &quot;Monster&quot; period. These would later be an important influence on German painter Sigmar Polke. From 1927 to 1930, Picabia produced his &quot;Transparencies&quot; series, paintings that combined images from High Renaissance art with figures from contemporary popular culture.

During the 1930s became a close friend of and received encouragement from the modernist novelist Gertrude Stein, painting a portrait of her in 1933. In 1940, he married Olga Mohler on 14 June, the same day that the Nazis seized Paris. Shortly after, he moved to the South of France, where his work took a surprising turn: he produced a series of paintings based on the nude glamour photos in French &quot;girlie&quot; magazines like &quot;Paris Sex-Appeal&quot;, in a garish style which appears to subvert traditional, academic nude painting. Some of these went to an Algerian merchant who sold them, and so it passed that Picabia came to decorate brothels across North Africa under the Occupation.

Before the end of World War II, he returned to Paris, where he resumed abstract painting and writing poetry. A large retrospective of his work was held at the Galerie René Drouin in Paris in the spring of 1949. Picabia died in Paris in 1953 and was interred in the Cimetière de Montmartre.

==Personal life==
He was married in 1909 to Gabrièle Buffet-Picabia, a French art critic and writer affiliated with Dadaism and later an organizer of the French resistance. They had four children. They divorced in 1930. Their tumultuous union is re-imagined by great-granddaughter Anne Berest in &quot;The Postcard&quot;, a semi-autobiographical French novel published in 2021.

==Legacy==
Public collections holding works by Picabia include the Museum of Modern Art and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Tate Gallery, London and the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne, Paris.

In the mid-1980s two of Picabia&#x27;s Dada writings, &quot;Who Knows&quot; and &quot;Yes No&quot; were published in English by Hanuman Books and in 2007 MIT Press published a large book of his poetry and other writings in English called &quot;I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation&quot; that was translated by Marc Lowenthal.

A major retrospective of Picabia&#x27;s work in the United States was held in 2016 at Kunsthaus Zürich and then from 2016 to 2017 at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The retrospective was widely discussed by international art critics such as Philippe Dagen from &quot;Le Monde&quot;.

Among the artists influenced by Picabia&#x27;s work are the American artists David Salle and Julian Schnabel, the German artist Sigmar Polke, and the Italian artist Francesco Clemente. In 1996, French artist Jean-Jacques Lebel initiated and co-curated the exhibition &quot;Picabia, Dalmau 1922&quot; (with reference to Picabia&#x27;s solo exhibition at Galeries Dalmau in 1922) shown at Fundació Antoni Tàpies in Barcelona and the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou. In 2002, the artists Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss installed Suzanne Pagé&#x27;s retrospective devoted to Picabia at the musée d&#x27;art moderne de la ville de Paris (MAMVP). 

In 2003, a Picabia painting once owned by André Breton sold for US$1.6million. Picabia&#x27;s &quot;Volucelle II&quot; () sold for
US$8,789,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2013, then the highest price for one of the artist&#x27;s works. A new record was set in 2022 with the sale of &quot;Pavonia&quot; at Sotheby&#x27;s for US$11million.
