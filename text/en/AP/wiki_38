<text>Abdullah Öcalan ( ; ; born 4 April 1948 or 1949), also known as Apo (short for Abdullah in Turkish; Kurdish for &quot;uncle&quot;), is a founding member of the militant Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK).

Öcalan was based in Syria from 1979 to 1998. He helped found the PKK in 1978, and led it into the Kurdish–Turkish conflict in 1984. For most of his leadership, he was based in Syria, which provided sanctuary to the PKK until the late 1990s.

After being forced to leave Syria, Öcalan was abducted by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) in Nairobi, Kenya in February 1999 and imprisoned on İmralı island in Turkey, where after a trial he was sentenced to death under Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, which concerns the formation of armed organizations. The sentence was commuted to aggravated life imprisonment when Turkey abolished the death penalty. From 1999 until 2009, he was the sole prisoner in İmralı prison in the Sea of Marmara, where he is still held.

Öcalan has advocated a political solution to the conflict since the 1993 Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party ceasefire. Öcalan&#x27;s prison regime has oscillated between long periods of isolation during which he is allowed no contact with the outside world, and periods when he is permitted visits. He was also involved in negotiations with the Turkish government that led to a temporary Kurdish–Turkish peace process in 2013.

From prison, Öcalan has published several books. Jineology, also known as the science of women, is a form of feminism advocated by Öcalan and subsequently a fundamental tenet of the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK). Öcalan&#x27;s philosophy of democratic confederalism is applied in the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (DAANES), an autonomous polity formed in Syria in 2012.

== Early life and education ==
Öcalan was born in Ömerli, a village in Halfeti, Şanlıurfa Province in eastern Turkey. While some sources report his date of birth as 4 April 1949, no official birth records exist. He has claimed not to know exactly when he was born, estimating the year to be 1946 or 1947. He is the oldest of seven children. He attended elementary school in a neighboring village and wanted to join the Turkish army. He applied to the military high school but failed in the admission exam. In 1966 he began to study at a vocational high school in Ankara () and attended meetings of anti-communists but also of circles active in left wing politics interested in improving Kurdish rights. He was also a very conservative Muslim in his youth and he admired Necip Fazıl Kısakürek. After graduating in 1969, Öcalan began working at the Title Deeds Office of Diyarbakır. It was at this time his political affiliation began to reform. He was relocated one year later to Istanbul where he participated in the meetings of the Revolutionary Cultural Eastern Hearths (DDKO). Later, he entered the Istanbul Law Faculty but after the first year transferred to Ankara University to study political science.

His return to Ankara was facilitated by the state in order to divide the &quot;Dev-Genç&quot; (Revolutionary Youth Federation of Turkey), of which Öcalan was a member. President Süleyman Demirel later regretted this decision, since the PKK was to become a much greater threat to the state than &quot;Dev-Genç&quot;.

Öcalan was not able to graduate from Ankara University, as on 7 April 1972 he was arrested after participating in a rally against the killing of Mahir Çayan. He was charged with distributing the left-wing political magazine &quot;Şafak&quot; (published by Doğu Perinçek) and was held for seven months at the Mamak Prison. In November 1973, the Ankara Democratic Association of Higher Education, (&quot;Ankara Demokratik Yüksek Öğrenim Demeği,&quot; ) was founded and shortly after he was elected to join its board. In the ADYÖD several students close to the political views of Hikmet Kıvılcımlı were active. In December 1974, &quot;ADYÖD&quot; was closed down. In 1975, together with Mazlum Doğan and , he published a political booklet which described the main aims for a &quot;Revolution in Kurdistan&quot;. During meetings in Ankara between 1974 and 1975, Öcalan and others came to the conclusion that Kurdistan was a colony and preparations ought to be made for a revolution. The group decided to disperse into the different towns in Turkish Kurdistan in order to set up a base of supporters for an armed revolution. At the beginning, this idea had only a few supporters, but following a journey Öcalan made through the cities of Ağrı, Batman, Diyarbakır, Bingöl, Kars and Urfa in 1977, the group counted over 300 adherents and had organised about thirty armed militants.

== The Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party ==
In 1978, in the midst of the right- and left-wing conflicts which culminated in the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état, Öcalan founded the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK). In July 1979 he fled to Syria.

Since its foundation, the party focused on ideological training. Marxism-Leninism, the history and estate of Kurdistan had a central role in the party. Öcalan elaborated on the importance of ideology to the extent to where he condemned &quot;ideologylessness&quot; and equated ideology with religion which according to him had replaced the latter. &quot;If you break the link between yourself and ideology you will beastialize&quot;. With the support of the Syrian Government, he established two training camps for the PKK in Lebanon where the Kurdish guerrillas should receive political and military training.

In 1984, the PKK initiated a campaign of armed conflict by attacking government forces in order to create an independent Kurdish state. Öcalan attempted to unite the Kurdish liberation movements of the PKK and the one active against Saddam Hussein in Iraq. In negotiations between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the PKK, it was agreed that the latter was able to move freely in Iraqi Kurdistan. He also met twice with Masoud Barzani, the leader of the KDP in Damascus, to resolve some minor issues they had once in 1984 and another time in 1985. But due to pressure from Turkey the cooperation remained timid. During an interview he gave to the Turkish Milliyet in 1988, he mentioned the goal wasn&#x27;t to gain independence from Turkey at all costs, but remained firm on the issue of the Kurdish rights, and suggested that negotiations should take place for a federation to be established in Turkey. In 1988, he also met with Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in Damascus, with which he signed an agreement and after some differences after the foundation of a Kurdish Government in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1992 he later had a better relationship.

In the early 1990s, interviews given to both Doğu Perinçek and Hasan Bildirici he mentioned his willingness to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict. In another given to Oral Çalışlar, he emphasized the difference between independence and separatism. He articulated the view that different nations were able to live in independence within the same state if they had equal rights. Then in 1993, upon request of Turkish president Turgut Özal, Öcalan met with Jalal Talabani for negotiations following which Öcalan declared a unilateral cease fire which had a duration from 20 March to 15 April. Later he prolonged it in order to enable negotiations with the Turkish government. Soon after Özal died on 17 April 1993, the initiative was halted by Turkey on the grounds that Turkey did not negotiate with terrorists. During an International Kurdish Conference in Brussels in March 1994, his initiative for equal rights for Kurds and Turks within Turkey was discussed. It is reported by Gottfried Stein, that at least during the first half of the 1990s, he used to live mainly in a protected neighborhood in Damascus. On 7 May 1996, in the midst of another unilateral cease-fire declared by the PKK, an attempt to assassinate him in a house in Damascus, was unsuccessful.

Following the protests which arose against the prohibition of the PKK in Germany, Öcalan had several meetings with politicians from Germany who came to hold talks with him. In the summer of 1995 the president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Verfassungsschutz) Klaus Grünewald came to visit him, And with the German MP Heinrich Lummer of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) he held meetings in October 1995 in Damascus and March 1996, during which they discussed the PKK&#x27;s activities in Germany. Öcalan assured him that the PKK would support a peaceful solution for the conflict. Back in Germany, Lummer made a statement in support for further negotiations with Öcalan. With time, the United States (1997), European Union, Syria, Turkey, and other countries have included the PKK on their lists of terrorist organizations. A Greek parliamentary delegation from the PASOK came to visit him in the Beqaa valley on 17 October 1996. During his stay in Syria he has published several books concerning the Kurdish revolution. On at least one occasion, in 1993, he was detained and held by Syria&#x27;s General Intelligence Directorate, but later released. Until 1998, Öcalan was based in Syria. As the situation deteriorated in Turkey, the Turkish government openly threatened Syria over its support for the PKK. As a result, the Syrian government forced Öcalan to leave the country but still refused turning him over to the Turkish authorities. In October 1998, Öcalan prepared for his departure from Syria and during a meeting in Kobane, he unsuccessfully attempted to lay the foundations for a new party which failed due to Syrian intelligence&#x27;s obstruction.

== Exile in Europe ==
Öcalan left Syria on 9 October 1998 and for the next four months, he toured several European countries advocating for a solution of the Kurdish-Turkish conflict. Öcalan first went to Russia where the Russian parliament voted on 4 November 1998 to grant him asylum. On 6 November 109 Greek parliamentarians invited Öcalan to stay in Greece, a move which was repeated by , the deputy speaker of the Greek Parliament at the time. Öcalan then chose to travel to Italy, where he landed on 12 November 1998 at the airport in Rome.

In 1998 the Turkish government requested the extradition of Öcalan from Italy, where he applied for political asylum upon his arrival. He was detained by the Italian authorities due to an arrest warrant issued by Germany. But Italy did not extradite him to Germany, who refused to hold a trial on Öcalan in its country. The German chancellor Gerhard Schröder as well as the Minister of the Interior Otto Schily preferred that Öcalan would be tried by an unspecified &quot;European Court&quot;. Italy also didn&#x27;t extradite him to Turkey. The Italian prime minister Massimo D&#x27;Alema announced it was contrary to Italian law to extradite someone to a country where the defendant is threatened with a capital punishment. But Italy also didn&#x27;t want Öcalan to stay, and pulled several diplomatic strings to compel him to leave the country, which was accomplished on 16 January when he departed to Nizhny Novgorod in hope to find a safe haven in Russia. But in Russia he was not as much welcomed as in October, and he had to wait for a week at the airport of Strigino International Airport in Nizhny Novgorod. From Russia, he took an airplane from Saint Petersburg to Greece where he arrived in Athens upon the invitation of Nikolas Naxakis, a retired Admiral on 29 January 1999. He spent the night as a guest of the popular Greek author Voula Damianakou in Nea Makri.

Following this, Öcalan attempted to travel to The Hague, to pursue a settlement of his legal situation at the International Criminal Court, but the Netherlands would not let his plane land and sent him back to Greece where he landed on the island Corfu in the Ionean Sea. Öcalan then decided to fly to Nairobi at the invitation of Greek diplomats. At that time he was defended by Britta Böhler, a high-profile German attorney who argued that the crimes he was accused of would have to be proven in court and attempted to reach that the International Court in The Hague would assume the case.

== Abduction, trial, and imprisonment ==

Öcalan was abducted in Kenya on 15 February 1999, while on his way from the Greek embassy to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, in an operation by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization ( &quot;,&quot; MIT) with the help of the CIA. According to the Turkish newspaper &quot;Vatan&quot;, the Americans transferred him to the Turkish authorities, who flew him back to Turkey for trial.

Following his capture, the Greek Government was in turmoil and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, Interior Minister Alekos Papadopoulos and the Minister of Public Order Philipos Petsalnikos resigned from their posts. Costoulas, the Greek ambassador who protected him, said that his own life was in danger after the operation. According to Nucan Derya, Öcalan&#x27;s interpreter in Kenya, the Kenyans had warned the Greek ambassador that &quot;something&quot; might happen if he didn&#x27;t leave four days prior and that they were given the assurance by Pangalos that Öcalan would have safe passage to Europe. Öcalan was determined to travel to Amsterdam and face the accusations of terrorism. Öcalan&#x27;s capture led thousands of Kurds to hold worldwide protests condemning his capture at Greek and Israeli embassies. Kurds living in Germany were threatened with deportation if they continued to hold demonstrations in support of Öcalan. The warning came after three Kurds were killed and 16 injured during the 1999 attack on the Israeli consulate in Berlin. A group named the &quot;Revenge Hawks of Apo&quot; set fire to a department store in Kadıköy Istanbul, causing the death of 13 people. In several European capitals and larger cities as well as in Iraq, Iran and also Turkey protests were organized against his capture.

=== Trial ===

He was brought to İmralı island, where he was interrogated for a period of 10 days without being allowed to see or speak to his lawyers. A state security court consisting of one military and two civilian judges was established on İmralı island to try Öcalan. A delegation of three Dutch lawyers who intended to defend him were not allowed to meet with their client and detained for questioning at the airport on the grounds that they acted as &quot;PKK militants&quot; and not lawyers; they were sent back to the Netherlands. On the seventh day a judge took part in the interrogations, and prepared a transcript of it. The trial began on 31 May 1999 on the İmralı island in the Sea of Marmara, and was organized by the Ankara State Security Court. During the trial, he was represented by the Asrın Law Office. His lawyers had difficulty in representing him adequately as they were allowed only two interviews per week of initially a duration of 20 minutes, and later 1 hour, of which several were cancelled due to &quot;bad weather&quot; or because the authorities didn&#x27;t give the permission needed for them. Also his lawyers were unaware of what the charges might be, and received the formal indictment only after excerpts of it were already presented to the press. The trial was accompanied by arrests of scores of Kurdish politicians from the People&#x27;s Democracy Party (HADEP). In mid-June 1999, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey approved the removal of military judges from the State Security Courts, in an attempt to address criticism from the European Court of Human Rights and a civilian judge assumed the post of the military judge. Shortly before the verdict was read out by Judge Turgut Okyay, when asked about his final remarks, he again offered to play a role in the peace finding process. Öcalan was charged with treason and separatism and sentenced to death on 29 June 1999. He was also banned from holding public office for life.

On the same day, Amnesty International (AI) demanded a re-trial and Human Rights Watch (HRW) questioned the fact that witnesses brought by the defense were not heard in the trial. In 1999 the Turkish Parliament discussed a so-called Repentance Bill which would commute Öcalans death sentence to 20 years imprisonment and allow PKK militants to surrender with a limited amnesty, but it didn&#x27;t pass due to resistance from the far-right around the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). In January 2000 the Turkish government declared the death sentence was delayed until the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) reviewed the verdict. Upon the abolition of the death penalty in Turkey in August 2002, in October of that year, the security court commuted his sentence to life imprisonment.

In an attempt to reach a verdict which was more favorable to Öcalan, he appealed at the ECHR at Strasbourg, which accepted the case in June 2004. In 2005, the ECHR ruled that Turkey had violated articles 3, 5, and 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights by refusing to allow Öcalan to appeal his arrest and by sentencing him to death without a fair trial. Öcalan&#x27;s request for a retrial was refused by Turkish courts.

=== Detention conditions ===
After his capture, Öcalan was held in solitary confinement as the only prisoner on İmralı island in the Sea of Marmara. Following the commutation of the death sentence to a life sentence in 2002, Öcalan remained imprisoned on İmralı, and was the sole inmate there. Although former prisoners at İmralı were transferred to other prisons, more than 1,000 Turkish military personnel were stationed on the island to guard him. In November 2009, Turkish authorities announced that they were ending his solitary confinement by transferring several other prisoners to İmralı. They said that Öcalan would be allowed to see them for ten hours a week. The new prison was built after the Council of Europe&#x27;s Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited the island and objected to the conditions in which he was being held. From 27 July 2011 until 2 May 2019 his lawyers have not been allowed to see Abdullah Öcalan. From July 2011 until December 2017 his lawyers filed more than 700 appeals for visits, but all were rejected.

There have been held regular demonstrations by the Kurdish community to raise awareness of the isolation of Öcalan. In October 2012 several hundred Kurdish political prisoners went on hunger strike for better detention conditions for Öcalan and the right to use the Kurdish language in education and jurisprudence. The hunger strike lasted 68 days until Öcalan demanded its end. Öcalan was banned from receiving visits almost two years from 6 October 2014 until 11 September 2016, when his brother Mehmet Öcalan visited him for Eid al-Adha. In 2014 the ECHR ruled in that there was a violation of article 3 in regards of him being to only prisoner on İmarli island until 17 November 2009, as well as the impossibility to appeal his verdict. On 6 September 2018 visits from lawyers were banned for six months due to former punishments he received in the years 2005–2009, the fact that the lawyers made their conversations with Ocalan public, and the impression that Öcalan was leading the PKK through communications with his lawyers. He was again banned from receiving visits until 12 January 2019 when his brother was permitted to visit him a second time. His brother said his health was good. The ban on the visitation of his lawyers was lifted in April 2019, and Öcalan saw his lawyers on 2 May 2019.

On 27 February 2025, Öcalan issued a message from prison calling for the PKK to hold a congress dissolving itself and lay down its weapons. In response, the PKK announced that it had begun a ceasefire on 1 March.

== Legal prosecution of sympathizers of Abdullah Öcalan ==

In 2008, the Justice Minister of Turkey, Mehmet Ali Şahin, said that between 2006 and 2007, 949 people were convicted and more than 7,000 people prosecuted for calling Öcalan &quot;esteemed&quot; (&quot;Sayın&quot;).

==The Kurdish people==

=== Involvement in peace initiatives ===

In November 1998, Öcalan elaborated on a 7-point peace plan according to which the Turkish attacks on Kurdish villages should stop, the refugees would be allowed to return, the Kurdish people would be granted autonomy within Turkey, the Kurds would receive the equal democratic rights as the Turks and the Turkish government supported village guards system shall come to an end and the Kurdish language and culture was to be officially recognized. In January 1999 during his stay in Europe, Öcalan saw the parties liberation struggle focus to have developed from guerrilla warfare to dialogue and negotiations. After his capture Öcalan called for a halt in PKK attacks, and advocated for a peaceful solution for the Kurdish conflict inside the borders of Turkey. In October 1999, eight PKK militants around the former European PKK spokesman Ali Sapan turned themselves in to Turkey on request of Öcalan. Depending on their treatment, the other PKK militants would turn themselves in as well, his attorney announced. But the eight, as well as another group which surrendered a few weeks later in Istanbul, were imprisoned and the peace initiative was dismissed by the Turkish Government. Öcalan called for the foundation of a &quot;Truth and Justice Commission&quot; by Kurdish institutions in order to investigate war crimes committed by both the PKK and Turkish security forces. A similar structure began functioning in May 2006. In March 2005, Öcalan issued the &quot;Declaration of Democratic confederalism in Kurdistan&quot; calling for a border-free confederation between the Kurdish regions of Southeastern Turkey (called &quot;Northern Kurdistan&quot; by Kurds), Northeast Syria (&quot;Western Kurdistan&quot;), Northern Iraq (&quot;South Kurdistan&quot;), and Northwestern Iran (&quot;East Kurdistan&quot;). In this zone, three bodies of law would be implemented: EU law, Turkish/Syrian/Iraqi/Iranian law and Kurdish law. This proposal was adopted by the PKK programme following the &quot;Refoundation Congress&quot; in April 2005.

Öcalan had his lawyer Ibrahim Bilmez release a statement on 28 September 2006 calling on the PKK to declare a ceasefire and seek peace with Turkey. Öcalan&#x27;s statement said, &quot;The PKK should not use weapons unless it is attacked with the aim of annihilation,&quot; and &quot;it is very important to build a democratic union between Turks and Kurds. With this process, the way to democratic dialogue will be also opened&quot;. He worked on a solution for the Kurdish–Turkish conflict, which would include a decentralization and democratization of Turkey within the frame of the European Charter of local Self-Government, which was also signed by Turkey, but his 160-page proposal on the subject was confiscated by the Turkish authorities in August 2009.

On 31 May 2010, Öcalan said he was abandoning the ongoing dialogue with Turkey, as &quot;this process is no longer meaningful or useful&quot;. Öcalan stated that Turkey had ignored his three protocols for negotiation: (a) his terms of health and security, (b) his release, and (c) a peaceful resolution to the Kurdish issue in Turkey. Though the Turkish government had received Öcalan&#x27;s protocols, they were never released to the public. Öcalan said he would leave the top PKK commanders in charge of the conflict, but that this should not be misinterpreted as a call for the PKK to intensify its armed conflict with Turkey.

In January 2013, peace negotiations between the PKK and the Turkish Government were initiated and from between January and March he met several times with politicians of Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) on Imralı Island. On 21 March, Öcalan declared a ceasefire between the PKK and the Turkish state. Öcalan&#x27;s statement was read to hundreds of thousands of Kurds in Diyarbakır who had gathered to celebrate the Kurdish New Year (&quot;Newroz&quot;). The statement said in part, &quot;Let guns be silenced and politics dominate... a new door is being opened from the process of armed conflict to democratization and democratic politics. It&#x27;s not the end. It&#x27;s the start of a new era.&quot; Soon after Öcalan&#x27;s declaration, the functional head of the PKK, Murat Karayılan responded by promising to implement a ceasefire. During the peace process, the pro-Kurdish Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party (HDP) entered parliament during the parliamentarian election of June 2015. The ceasefire ended after in July 2015 two Turkish police officers were killed in Ceylanpinar.

=== Political ideological shift ===
Since his incarceration, Öcalan has significantly changed his ideology through exposure to Western social theorists such as Murray Bookchin, Immanuel Wallerstein and Hannah Arendt. Abandoning his old Marxism-Leninist and Stalinist beliefs, Öcalan fashioned his ideal society called democratic confederalism. In early 2004, Öcalan attempted to arrange a meeting with Murray Bookchin through Öcalan&#x27;s lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin&#x27;s &quot;student&quot; eager to adapt Bookchin&#x27;s thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to meet with Öcalan.

=== Democratic confederalism ===

Democratic confederalism is a &quot;system of popularly elected administrative councils, allowing local communities to exercise autonomous control over their assets, while linking to other communities via a network of confederal councils.&quot; Decisions are made by communes in each neighborhood, village, or city. All are welcome to partake in the communal councils, but political participation is not mandated. There is no private property, but rather &quot;ownership by use, which grants individuals usage rights to the buildings, land, and infrastructure, but not the right to sell and buy on the market or convert them to private enterprises&quot;. The economy is in the hands of the communal councils, and is thus (in the words of Bookchin) &#x27;neither collectivised nor privatised - it is common.&#x27; Feminism, ecology, and direct democracy are essential in democratic confederalism.

With his 2005 &quot;Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan&quot;, Öcalan advocated for a Kurdish implementation of Bookchin&#x27;s &quot;The Ecology of Freedom&quot; via municipal assemblies as a democratic confederation of Kurdish communities beyond the state borders of Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. Öcalan promoted a platform of shared values: environmentalism, self-defense, gender equality, and a pluralistic tolerance for religion, politics, and culture. While some of his followers questioned Öcalan&#x27;s conversion from Marxism-Leninism to social ecology, the PKK adopted Öcalan&#x27;s proposal and began to form assemblies. It became also the ideology of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and is applied in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES).

=== On women&#x27;s rights ===
Öcalan is a supporter of the liberation of the women, he writes in his Freedom Manifesto for Women that all slavery is based on the housewifization of women. He deems the woman often as being trapped in a situation where she accepts traditional gender roles and a disadvantaged relationship with a man.

== Personal life ==
According to his own account, while his father is Kurdish, his mother is Turkmen. According to some sources, Öcalan&#x27;s grandmother was an ethnic Turk. Öcalan&#x27;s mother, Esma Öcalan (Uveys) was rather dominant and criticised his father, blaming him for their dire economic situation. He later explained in an interview that it was in his childhood he learned to defend himself from injustice. Like many Kurds in Turkey, Öcalan was raised speaking Turkish; according to Amikam Nachmani, lecturer at the Bar-Ilan University in Israel, Öcalan did not know Kurdish when he met him in 1991. Nachmani: &quot;He [Öcalan] told me that he speaks Turkish, gives orders in Turkish, and thinks in Turkish.&quot; In 1978 Öcalan married Kesire Yildirim, who he had met at the Ankara University and was of a better household than the regular revolutionaries around Öcalan. They had a difficult marriage with reportedly many disputes and discussions. In 1988, while representing the PKK in Athens, Greece, his wife unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow Öcalan, following which Yildirim went underground.

After his sister Havva was married to a man from another village in an arranged marriage, he felt regret. This event led Öcalan to his policies towards the liberation of women from the traditional suppressed female role. Öcalan&#x27;s brother Osman became a PKK commander until he defected from the PKK with several others to establish the Patriotic and Democratic Party of Kurdistan. His other brother, Mehmet Öcalan, is a member of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). Fatma Öcalan is the sister of Abdullah Öcalan and Dilek Öcalan, a former parliamentarian of the HDP, is his niece. Ömer Öcalan, a current member of parliament for the HDP, is his nephew.

== Honorary citizenships ==
Several localities have awarded him with an honorary citizenship:

== Publications ==

Öcalan is the author of more than 40 books, four of which were written in prison. Many of the notes taken from his weekly meetings with his lawyers have been edited and published. He has also written articles for the newspaper Özgür Gündem which is a newspaper that reported on the Kurdish-Turkish conflict, under the pseudonym of Ali Firat.

<text>Sia or Saa, an ancient Egyptian god, was the deification of perception in the Heliopolitan Ennead cosmogony and is probably equivalent to the &quot;intellectual energies of the heart of Ptah in the Memphite theology.&quot; He also had a connection with writing and was often shown in anthropomorphic form holding a papyrus scroll. This papyrus was thought to embody intellectual achievements.

The god personifies the perceptive mind. In ancient Egyptian mythology, Sia was believed to have been created from blood that dripped from the phallus of Ra. In the Old Kingdom, Sia was often depicted on the right side of Ra, holding his sacred papyrus.

In the New Kingdom, Sia is depicted in the solar barque in the underworld texts and tomb decorations, together with Hu, the &quot;creative utterance,&quot; and Heka, the god of magic. These gods were seen as special powers helping the creator, and although Heka had his own cult Sia did not.

==Hieroglyph: Sia==
The Sia (hieroglyph) was also used to represent &quot;to perceive&quot;, &quot;to know&quot; or &quot;to be cognizant&quot;.

<text>Sun Records is an American independent record label founded by producer Sam Phillips in Memphis, Tennessee on February 1, 1952. Sun was the first label to record Elvis Presley, Charlie Rich, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash. Prior to that, Sun had concentrated mainly on African-American musicians because Phillips loved rhythm and blues and wanted to bring it to a white audience.

On January 28, 2021, Sun Records was acquired by Primary Wave for $30 million.

==History==
Sam Phillips opened his Memphis Recording Service studio on January 3, 1950, at 706 Union Avenue in Memphis. It was founded with the financial aid of Jim Bulliet, one of many record executives for whom Phillips had scouted artists before 1952.

In March 1951, Phillips produced &quot;Rocket 88&quot; by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, who were actually Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm. Because of Turner&#x27;s Delta blues connections, he was contracted by Phillips as a talent scout and he was effectively an in-house producer. Turner brought fellow musicians Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, Little Milton, Billy &quot;The Kid&quot; Emerson and Roscoe Gordon to record for Phillips.

The success of &quot;Rocket 88&quot; helped fund the creation of Sun Records which Phillips founded in February 1952. Before creating Sun, Phillips licensed recordings to Chess Records for release. But by 1952, his relationship with the Chess brothers was strained and he had disputes with the Bihari brothers at Modern Records. Initially, Phillips didn&#x27;t want to create a record label. He said, &quot;I was forced into it by those labels either coming to Memphis to record or taking my artists elsewhere.&quot;

The original Sun Records logo was designed by John Gale Parker Jr., a resident of Memphis and high school classmate of Phillips. Sun Records shared the same building as Sun Studio (formerly Memphis Recording Service). There, Phillips discovered and first recorded such influential musicians such as Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis. Presley&#x27;s recording contract was eventually sold to RCA Victor for $40,000 (US$ in dollars) in 1955 to relieve Sun&#x27;s financial difficulties. Sun record producer and engineer Jack Clement discovered and recorded Jerry Lee Lewis while Phillips was away on a trip to Florida in 1956.

Some of the other artists who recorded for Sun were Rufus Thomas (who recorded solo and with his daughter Carla Thomas), Tex Weiss, Charlie Rich, Bill Justis, Conway Twitty (who at that time recorded under his real name, Harold Jenkins), Barbara Pittman and the Miller Sisters.

In the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful song &quot;Nashville Cats&quot;, John Sebastian used poetic license when he referred to Sun as the &quot;Yellow Sun Records from Nashville&quot;.

In 1969, Mercury Records label producer Shelby Singleton purchased the Sun label from Phillips. Singleton merged his operations into Sun International Corporation, which re-released and re-packaged compilations of Sun&#x27;s early artists in the early 1970s. It later introduced rockabilly tribute singer Jimmy &quot;Orion&quot; Ellis in 1979, with Orion taking on the persona of Elvis Presley.

The company remains in business as Sun Entertainment Corporation, and currently licenses its brand and classic hit recordings (many of which have appeared in CD boxed sets and other compilations) to independent reissue labels. Sun Entertainment also includes SSS International Records, Plantation Records, Amazon Records, Red Bird Records, Blue Cat Records among other labels the company acquired over the years. Its website sells collectible items and compact discs bearing the original 1950s Sun logo.

Sun Records is located in Nashville, Tennessee. It has been mainly a reissue label since the 1970s but signed country musician Julie Roberts to a recording contract in 2013.

The music of many Sun Records musicians helped lay part of the foundation of late 20th-century rock and roll and influenced many younger musicians, including the Beatles. In 2001, Paul McCartney appeared on a tribute compilation album titled &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight: The Legacy of Sun Records&quot;. The 2008 tribute &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot; is based on the famous photograph of Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis grouped round Elvis Presley at the piano, the night when the four joined in an impromptu jam at Sun Records&#x27; one-room sound studio, the &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot; of December 4, 1956.

A TV series about the label ran for eight episodes on CMT from February to April 2017.

In August 2022, Sun Records issued a 70th Anniversary Compilation album. The album features contributions from ten of the industry&#x27;s top music supervisors and includes tracks from artists from the Sun catalogue including James Cotton, Linda Martell, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, The Dixie Cups, The Imperial Wonders, Rufus Thomas Jr., and Barbara Pittman.

In November 2022, Peter Guralnick and Colin Escott released &quot;The Birth of Rock ‘N’ Roll: The Illustrated Story of Sun Records and the 70 Recordings that Changed the World&quot;, a history of Sun Records illustrated by 70 records.

<doc id="98459" wikidata="Q1195229" url="?curid=98459" title="Sopdu">
<text>Sopdu (also rendered Septu or Sopedu) was a god of the sky and of eastern border regions in the religion of Ancient Egypt.
He was Khensit&#x27;s husband.

As a sky god, Sopdu was connected with the god Sah, the personification of the constellation Orion, and the goddess Sopdet, representing the star Sirius. According to the Pyramid Texts, Horus-Sopdu, a combination of Sopdu and the greater sky god Horus, is the offspring of Osiris-Sah and Isis-Sopdet.

As a god of the east, Sopdu was said to protect Egyptian outposts along the frontiers and to help the pharaoh control those regions&#x27; foreign inhabitants. He was referred to as &quot;Lord of the East&quot;, and had his greatest cult centre at the easternmost nome of Lower Egypt, which was named Per-Sopdu, meaning &quot;place of Sopdu&quot;. He also had shrines at Egyptian settlements in the Sinai Peninsula, such as the turquoise mines at Serabit el-Khadim.

== Name ==
Sopdu&#x27;s name is composed of the hieroglyph for &quot;sharp&quot;, a pointed triangle, and the 3rd person plural suffix (a quail); thus a literal translation of his name is &quot;sharp ones&quot;. He was said, in the Pyramid Texts, to protect the teeth of the deceased pharaoh.

Sopdu was depicted as a falcon sitting on a religious standard, often with a two-feathered crown on his head and a flail over his shoulder. In his border-guarding role he was shown as a Near Eastern warrior, with a &quot;shemset&quot; girdle and an axe or spear.

<doc id="98471" wikidata="Q478490" url="?curid=98471" title="Seshat">
<text>Seshat (, under various spellings) was the ancient Egyptian goddess of writing, wisdom, and knowledge. She was the daughter of Thoth. She was seen as a scribe and record keeper; her name means &quot;female scribe&quot;. She is credited with inventing writing. She also became identified as the goddess of sciences, accounting, architecture, astronomy, astrology, building, mathematics, and surveying.

==Origins==
Seshat is attested from the Second Dynasty, where she assists King Khasekhemwy with the &quot;stretching the cord&quot; ritual.

==Roles==
As the divine measurer and scribe, Seshat was believed to appear to assist the pharaoh in both of these practises. Seshat assisted the pharaoh in the &quot;stretching the cord&quot; ritual. This ritual is related to laying out the foundations of temples and other important structures in order to determine and assure the sacred alignments and the precision of the dimensions. She was also the &quot;mistress of builders&quot;, and laid the plans for the construction and expansion of sacred sites such as temples. Her skills were necessary for surveying the land, to re-establish boundary-lines after the annual floods. The priestess who officiated at these functions in her name also oversaw the staff of others who performed similar duties and were trained in mathematics and the related store of knowledge.

She also was responsible for recording the speeches the pharaoh made during the crowning-ceremony and approving the inventory of foreign captives and goods gained in military campaigns. During the New Kingdom, she was involved in the Sed festival held by the pharaohs, who could celebrate thirty years of reign, recording the regnal years of the king and his jubilees on leaves of the &quot;ished&quot; or persea tree. It was she who recorded, by notching her palm, the time allotted to the pharaoh for his stay on earth.

&quot;Mistress of the House of Books&quot; is another title for Seshat, being the deity whose priests oversaw the library in which scrolls of the most important knowledge were assembled and spells were preserved. One prince of the Fourth Dynasty, Wep-em-nefret, is noted as the &quot;Overseer of the Royal Scribes, Priest of Seshat&quot; on a slab stela. Heliopolis was the location of her principal sanctuary.

Seshat also appeared in funerary contexts, where, along with Nephthys, she restores the limbs of the deceased.

Seshat was closely associated with Thoth (&quot;Djehuty&quot; in ancient Egyptian), the reckoner of time and god of writing who was also venerated as a god of wisdom, with whom he shared some overlapping functions. She was variously considered to be the sister, wife, or daughter of Thoth. Seshat is the inventor of writing and Thoth taught writing to man.

==Iconography==
In ancient Egyptian art, she was depicted as a woman with a seven-pointed emblem above her head. It is unclear what this emblem represents. This emblem is the origin of an alternate name for Seshat, Sefkhet-Abwy, which means &quot;seven-horned&quot;. Usually, she is shown holding a palm stem, bearing notches to denote the recording of the passage of time, especially for keeping track of the allotment of time for the life of the pharaoh. She was also depicted holding other tools and, often, holding the knotted cords that were stretched to survey land and structures. She is frequently shown dressed in a cheetah- or leopard-hide, a symbol of funerary priests. If not shown with the hide over a dress, the pattern of the dress is that of the spotted feline. The pattern on the natural hide was thought to represent the stars, being a symbol of eternity, and to be associated with the night sky.

===Emblem===

The Seshat emblem is a hieroglyph representing the goddess Seshat in ancient Egypt. As the emblem symbolizes this deity, it sits atop her head. The emblem was a long stem with a seven-petal flower on top and surmounted by a pair of horns; the archaic form had seven petals (the vertical shaft as 8), (as a vertical, with two crossed lines-(4), as a &#x27;star&#x27;, and one horizontal, giving 7+ the 1-vertical shaft), and surmounted by two enclosing sickle-shaped signs, two falcon-feathers on top.

Alan Gardiner identified the emblem as a &quot;conventionalized flower (?) surmounted by horns.&quot; Alternatively, the symbol may represent a device similar to a groma.

The famous 24th century BC Palermo Stone has multiple uses of &quot;Seshat&#x27;s emblem&quot;. It occurs on the obverse of the &quot;Palermo Piece&quot; (at Palermo Museum), 1 of the 2 large pieces of the 7—piece Palermo Stone. It is used on the obverse, Row III (of VI rows), and is used twice in King Year Record 34, and 40 of King Den. It is also used elsewhere on the stone for &quot;God Seshu&quot;, the male counterpart of Seshat (Seshait or Sesha-t).

F31:X1.R21 ! U1-S39-Z9:Z9 ! I9:D47:X1-S39-Z9:Z9 !!
The reading is approximately: &quot;YEAR: To create (a) Statue for Seshait, Statue for Mafdet.&quot; (The King Year 34 &quot;register&quot; has the clearer of the two styles of Seshat Emblem, with larger spacing between the two vertical feathers. Note: the Gardiner font reads left-to-right; the Palermo Stone is written opposite: right-to-left. A large renpet (hieroglyph) for YEAR, precedes the register (forms its starting border).)

==Worship==
Seshat barely appears outside of her official role as the recorder of construction and written projects and did not have a temple or cult dedicated to her.

<text>Sopdet is the ancient Egyptian name of the star Sirius and its personification as an Egyptian goddess. Known to the Greeks as Sothis, she was conflated with Isis as a goddess and Anubis as a god. 
==Names==
The exact pronunciation of ancient Egyptian is uncertain, as vowels were not recorded until a very late period. In modern transcription, her name usually appears as Sopdet (, ), after the known Greek and Latin form Sothis ().

==History==

During the early period of Egyptian civilization, the heliacal rising of the bright star preceded the usual annual flooding of the Nile. It was therefore apparently used for the solar civil calendar which largely superseded the original lunar calendar in the 3rdmillenniumBC. Despite the wandering nature of the Egyptian calendar, the erratic timing of the flood from year to year, and the slow procession of Sirius within the solar year, Sopdet continued to remain central to cultural depictions of the year and to celebrations of Wep Renpet (), the Egyptian New Year. She was also venerated as a goddess of the fertility brought to the soil by the flooding.

She was long thought to be represented by the cow on an ivory tablet from the reign of Djer (Dynasty I), but this is no longer supported by most Egyptologists. During the Old Kingdom, she was an important goddess of the annual flood and a psychopomp guiding deceased pharaohs through the Egyptian underworld. During the Middle Kingdom, she was primarily a mother and nurse and, by the Ptolemaic period, she was almost entirely subsumed into Isis.

==Myths==

Sopdet is the consort of Sah, the personified constellation of Orion near Sirius. Their child Venus was the hawk god Sopdu, &quot;Lord of the East&quot;. As the &quot;bringer of the New Year and the Nile flood&quot;, she was associated with Osiris from an early date and by the Ptolemaic period Sah and Sopdet almost solely appeared in forms conflated with Osiris and Isis.

==Representation==
She was depicted as a woman with a five-pointed star upon her head, usually with a horned hedjet similar to Satis. In the Ptolemaic and Roman period, the European notion of the &quot;Dog Star&quot; caused her to sometimes be represented as a large dog or as a woman riding one sidesaddle.

From the Middle Kingdom, Sopdet sometimes appeared as a god who held up part of Nut (the sky or firmament) with Hathor. In Greco-Roman Egypt, the male Sopdet was conflated with the dog-headed Anubis.

<text>Exeter Cathedral, properly known as the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter in Exeter, is an Anglican cathedral, and the seat of the Bishop of Exeter, in the city of Exeter, Devon, in South West England. The present building was complete by about 1400 and has several notable features, including an early set of misericords, an astronomical clock and the longest uninterrupted medieval stone vaulted ceiling in the world.

==History==

The site where Exeter Cathedral was constructed was home to Roman buildings. A legionary fortress was constructed between 50–75 AD. A Roman bathhouse was discovered in 1971.

The founding of the cathedral at Exeter, dedicated to Saint Peter, dates from 1050, when the seat of the bishop of Devon and Cornwall was transferred from Crediton because of a fear of sea-raids. A Saxon minster already existing within the town (and dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Peter) was used by Leofric as his seat.

In 1107 William Warelwast was appointed to the see, and this was the catalyst for the building of a new cathedral in the Norman style. Its official foundation was in 1133, during Warelwast&#x27;s time, but it took many more years to complete. Following the appointment of Walter Bronescombe as bishop in 1258, the building was already recognised as outmoded, and it was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style, following the example of Salisbury. However, much of the Norman building was kept, including the two massive square towers and part of the walls. It was constructed entirely of local stone, including Purbeck Marble. The new cathedral was complete by about 1400, apart from the addition of the chapter house and chantry chapels.

Like most English cathedrals, Exeter suffered during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but not as much as it would have done had it been a monastic foundation. Further damage was done during the Civil War, when the cloisters were destroyed. Following the restoration of Charles II, a new pipe organ was built in the cathedral by John Loosemore. Charles II&#x27;s sister Henrietta Anne of England was baptised here in 1644. In 1650 an independent church was meeting in the cathedral and this small church caused upset when the minister &quot;excommunicated&quot; Susanna Parr.

During the Victorian era, some refurbishment was carried out by George Gilbert Scott. As a boy, the composer Matthew Locke was trained in the choir of Exeter Cathedral, under Edward Gibbons, the brother of Orlando Gibbons. His name can be found scribed into the stone organ screen.

During the Second World War, Exeter was one of the targets of a German air offensive against British cities of cultural and historical importance, which became known as the &quot;Baedeker Blitz&quot;. On 4 May 1942 an early-morning air raid took place over Exeter. The cathedral sustained a direct hit by a large high-explosive bomb on the chapel of St James, completely demolishing it. The muniment room above, three bays of the aisle and two flying buttresses were also destroyed in the blast. The medieval wooden screen opposite the chapel was smashed into many pieces by the blast, but it has been reconstructed and restored. Many of the cathedral&#x27;s most important artefacts, such as the ancient glass (including the great east window), the misericords, the bishop&#x27;s throne, the Exeter Book, the ancient charters (of King Athelstan and Edward the Confessor) and other precious documents from the library had been removed in anticipation of such an attack. The precious effigy of Walter Branscombe had been protected by sand bags.

In July 2023, &quot;The Methodist Recorder&quot; reported that the cathedral chapter signed a sharing agreement between it and Mint Methodist Exeter for shared use of the Lady Chapel.

== Architecture ==

The Norman cathedral construction began in 1112, presumably at the east end and was consecrated in 1133, by which date the choir, transept and first two bays of the nave were probably complete. As detailed above, remains of the Norman building can be seen in the massive transept towers. By 1160 the nave and west front were complete, and a cloister and chapter house were added between 1180 and 1244.

During the 1270s, a new project began to replace the entire east end, starting with the east end chapels. This work is documented by a very extensive series of fabric rolls. Work advanced slowly, with the retrochoir, presbytery and choir being built in the 1290s. The original choir elevation had two storeys, but was later modified to three, presumably after the arrival of Master Roger in 1297. Master Thomas of Witney was engaged in 1316 to design the choir furnishings, then became master mason and stayed at Exeter until 1342. 

By 1328 the church was complete to the first two bays of the nave, where a design change in the vaults is visible. During Master Thomas of Witney&#x27;s time the east cloister walk was begun (1318–25) and the nave, west front and north cloister walk were probably completed (c.1328–42). That the present west front is on the same site as the Norman predecessor is indicated by the narrowing of the nave bays towards the west, squeezed to meet an existing feature.

The image screen across the west facade and the chantry chapel of Bishop Grandisson located within the west front were probably designed by William Joy, who succeeded Witney as master mason in 1342 but seems to have died in 1347, possibly from the Black Death. From 1377 to 1414 the east, south and west cloister walks were finished by Master Robert Lesyngham, who probably also designed the great East Window (1390–92).

The architecture of Exeter Cathedral at first appears remarkably harmonious with the continuous run of tierceron vaults extending from west to east. Although the bays are irregular in size, the plan is throughout based on a division into ninths. There is also a wonderful array of tracery designs in the clerestorey windows. More detailed analysis nevertheless reveals a number of changes, including the decision to adopt a three-storey facade with a triforium more typical of cathedrals than the previous two-storey design. 3-D scanning of the vaults has also revealed numerous changes to the curvatures of the ribs.

==Notable features==
Notable features of the interior include the misericords, the minstrels&#x27; gallery, the astronomical clock and the organ. Notable architectural features of the interior include the multiribbed ceiling and the compound piers in the nave arcade.

The bishop&#x27;s throne in the choir was made from Devon oak between 1312 and 1316; the nearby choir stalls were made by George Gilbert Scott in the 1870s. The Great East Window contains much 14th-century glass, and there are over 400 ceiling bosses, one of which depicts the murder of Thomas Becket. The bosses can be seen at the peak of the vaulted ceiling, joining the ribs together. Because there is no centre tower, Exeter Cathedral has the longest uninterrupted medieval vaulted ceiling in the world, at about .

===Misericords===

The fifty misericords are the earliest complete set in the United Kingdom. They date from two periods: 1220–1230 and 1250–1260. Amongst other things, they depict the earliest known wooden representation of an elephant in the UK. They have supporters.
===Minstrels&#x27; gallery===

The minstrels&#x27; gallery in the nave dates to around 1360 and is unique in English cathedrals. Its front is decorated with 12 carved and painted angels playing medieval musical instruments, including the cittern, bagpipe, hautboy, crwth, harp, trumpet, organ, guitar, tambourine and cymbals, with two others which are uncertain. Since the above list was compiled in 1921, research among musicologists has revised how some of the instruments are called in modern times. Using revised names, the list should now read from left to right gittern, bagpipe, shawm, vielle, harp, jew&#x27;s harp, trumpet, organ, citole, recorder, tambourine, cymbals.

===Astronomical clock===

The Exeter Cathedral Astronomical Clock is one of the group of famous 14th- to 16th-century astronomical clocks to be found in the west of England. Others are at Wells, Ottery St Mary, and Wimborne Minster.

The main, lower, dial is the oldest part of the clock, dating from 1484. The fleur-de-lys-tipped hand indicates the hour (and the position of the sun in the sky) on a 24-hour analogue dial. The numbering consists of two sets of Roman numerals I to XII. The silver ball and inner dial shows both the age of the moon and its phase (using a rotating black shield to indicate the moon&#x27;s phase). The upper dial, added in 1760, shows the minutes.

The Latin phrase &quot;Pereunt et imputantur&quot;, a favourite motto for clocks and sundials, was written by the Latin poet Martial. It is usually translated as &quot;they perish and are reckoned to our account&quot;, referring to the hours that we spend, wisely or not. The original clockwork mechanism, much modified, repaired, and neglected until it was replaced in the early 20th century, can be seen on the floor below. The door below the clock has a round hole near its base. This was cut in the early 17th century to allow entry for the bishop&#x27;s cat to deter vermin that were attracted to the animal fat used to lubricate the clock mechanism.
===Library===

The library began during the episcopate of Leofric (1050–1072) who presented the cathedral with 66 books, only one of which remains in the library: this is the Exeter Book (Exeter Cathedral Library MS 3501) of Anglo-Saxon poetry. 16 others have survived and are in the British Library, the Bodleian Library or Cambridge University Library. A 10th-century manuscript of Hrabanus Maurus&#x27;s &quot;De Computo&quot; and Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;De Natura Rerum&quot; may have belonged to Leofric also but the earliest record of it is in an inventory of 1327. The inventory was compiled by the Sub-Dean, William de Braileghe, and 230 titles were listed. Service books were not included and a note at the end mentions many other books in French, English and Latin which were then considered worthless.

In 1412–13 a new lectrinum was fitted out for the books by two carpenters working for 40 weeks. Those books in need of repair were repaired and some were fitted with chains. A catalogue of the cathedral&#x27;s books made in 1506 shows that the library furnished some 90 years earlier had 11 desks for books and records over 530 titles, of which more than a third are service books.

In 1566 the Dean and Chapter presented to Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, a manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Gospels which had been given by Leofric; in 1602, 81 manuscripts from the library were presented to Sir Thomas Bodley for the Bodleian Library at Oxford. In 1657 under the Commonwealth the cathedral was deprived of several of its ancillary buildings, including the reading room of 1412–13. Some books were lost but a large part of them were saved due to the efforts of Dr Robert Vilvaine, who had them transferred to St John&#x27;s Hospital. At a later date he provided funds to convert the Lady chapel into a library, and the books were brought back.

By 1752 it is thought the collection had grown considerably to some 5,000 volumes, to a large extent by benefactions. In 1761 Charles Lyttelton, Dean of Exeter, describes it as having over 6,000 books and some good manuscripts. He describes the work which has been done to repair and list the contents of the manuscripts. At the same time the muniments and records had been cleaned and moved to a suitable muniment room.

In 1820 the library was moved from the Lady Chapel to the chapter house. In the later 19th century two large collections were received by the cathedral, and it was necessary to construct a new building to accommodate the whole library. The collections of Edward Charles Harington and Frederic Charles Cook were together more than twice the size of the existing library, and John Loughborough Pearson was the architect of the new building on the site of the old cloister. During the 20th century the greater part of the library was transferred to rooms in the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, while the remainder was kept in Pearson&#x27;s cloister library.

Today, there is a good collection of early medical books, part of which came in 1948 from the Exeter Medical Library (founded 1814), and part on permanent loan from the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital (1,300 volumes, 1965). The most decorated manuscript in the library is a psalter (MS 3508) probably written for the Church of St Helen at Worcester in the early 13th century. The earliest printed book now in the library is represented by only a single leaf: this is Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De officiis&quot; (Mainz: Fust and Schoeffer, 1465–66).

===Bells===

Both of the cathedral&#x27;s towers contain bells. The North Tower contains an bourdon bell, called Peter. Peter used to swing but it is now only chimed.

The South Tower contains the second heaviest peal of 12 bells hung for change ringing in the world, with a tenor weighing . They are second only to Liverpool Cathedral in weight. There are also two semitone bells in addition to the peal of 12.

==Legends==

One 19th-century author claimed that an 11th-century missal asserted that King Æthelstan, the previous century, had brought together a great collection of holy relics at Exeter Cathedral; sending out emissaries at great expense to the continent to acquire them. Amongst these items were said to be a little of &quot;the bush in which the Lord spoke to Moses&quot;, and a &quot;bit of the candle which the angel of the Lord lit in Christ&#x27;s tomb&quot;.

According to the semi-legendary tale, the Protestant martyr Agnes Prest, during her brief time of liberty in Exeter before her execution in 1557, met a stonemason repairing the statues at the cathedral. She stated that there was no use repairing their noses, since &quot;within a few days shall all lose their heads&quot;. There is a memorial to her and another Protestant martyr, Thomas Benet, in the Livery Dole area of Exeter. The memorial was designed by Harry Hems and raised by public subscription in 1909.

==Wildlife==
The tube web spider &quot;Segestria florentina&quot;, notable for its iridescent shiny green fangs, can be found within the outer walls. The walls are made of calcareous stone, which decays from acidic pollution, to form cracks and crevices which the spider and other invertebrates inhabit.

==Music==

=== Choir ===

Exeter Cathedral Choir is composed of 38 Choristers (boys and girls) along with Choral Scholars and Lay Vicars. There is also a voluntary choir, the St Peter&#x27;s singers, dating back to 1881.

=== Organists ===

Recorded names of organists at Exeter go back to Matthew Godwin, 1586. Notable organists at Exeter Cathedral include Victorian composer Samuel Sebastian Wesley, grandson of Methodist founder and hymn-writer Charles Wesley, educator Ernest Bullock, and conductor Thomas Armstrong. The current Director of Music, Timothy Noon, was appointed in 2016.

===Organ===

The Cathedral organ stands on the ornate medieval screen, preserving the old classical distinction between quire and nave. The first organ was built by John Loosemore in 1665. There was a radical rebuild by Henry Willis in 1891, and again by Harrison &amp; Harrison in 1931. The largest pipes, the lower octave of the 32′ Contra Violone, stand just inside the south transept. The organ has one of only three trompette militaire stops in the country (the others are in Liverpool Cathedral and London&#x27;s St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral), housed in the minstrels&#x27; gallery, along with a chorus of diapason pipes.

In January 2013 an extensive refurbishment began on the organ, undertaken by Harrison &amp; Harrison. The work consisted of an overhaul and a re-design of the internal layout of the soundboards and ranks of the organ pipes. In October 2014 the work was completed and the organ was reassembled, save for the final voicing and tuning of the new instrument.

<text>Robert Gair was a Scottish printer and paper bag maker who invented the folding carton in 1879.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1839, he emigrated to the United States at age 14. Gair invented the paperboard folding carton by accident when a metal ruler used to crease bags shifted position and cut the bag. Gair found that by cutting and creasing paperboard in one operation, he could make prefabricated cartons. He ultimately entered the corrugated fiberboard shipping container business in the 1900s. His idea was developed and utilized by E. S. &amp; A. Robinson with whom he had long-term business dealings.

Gair founded a paper empire and occupied several buildings in the area of Brooklyn now known as DUMBO, many of which still bear his name.

<doc id="98503" wikidata="Q402645" url="?curid=98503" title="Alfie (1966 film)">
<text>Alfie is a 1966 British comedy-drama film directed by Lewis Gilbert and starring Michael Caine. The Paramount Pictures release was adapted from the 1963 play of the same name by Bill Naughton. Following its premiere at the Plaza Theatre in the West End of London on 24 March 1966, the film became a box office success, enjoying critical acclaim, and influencing British cinema.

The narrative follows a young, womanising man leading a self-centred life, focused on his own enjoyment until events force him to question his uncaring behaviour, his loneliness, and his priorities. Alfie cheats on numerous women, treating them with disrespect, using them for sex and domestic affairs. He frequently breaks the fourth wall, speaking directly to the camera, narrating and justifying his actions, despite broad contradictions.

==Plot==
Alfie Elkins, a handsome, self-centered, narcissistic Cockney chauffeur in London, enjoys the sexual favours of married and single women while avoiding commitment. He is ending an affair with Siddie, a married woman, just as he gets his submissive girlfriend, Gilda, pregnant. Alfie thinks nothing of pilfering fuel and money from his employer and tells Gilda to do the same. Although he refuses to marry her, and despite his constant cheating, Gilda decides to have the child, Malcolm Alfred, and keep him rather than give him up.

Over time, Alfie becomes quite attached to his son, but his unwillingness to marry Gilda causes her to break up with him and marry Humphrey, a kindly bus conductor and neighbour who loves her and is willing to accept Malcolm Alfred as his own. Gilda bars Alfie from any further contact with Malcolm, forcing him to watch from a distance as Humphrey steps into his fatherly role. When a health check reveals Alfie has tubercular shadows on his lungs, the diagnosis and his fear of death, combined with his separation from his son, lead him to have a brief mental breakdown.

Alfie spends time recuperating in a pastoral sanatorium, where he befriends Harry, a fellow patient, a family man devoted to his frumpy wife, Lily. Alfie makes out with one of the nurses, disgusting Harry. When Alfie flippantly suggests that Lily might be cheating on him, Harry angrily confronts Alfie about his attitudes and behaviour.

Released from the convalescent home, Alfie briefly stops working as a chauffeur to take holiday photos of tourists near the Tower of London. He meets Ruby, an older, voluptuous, affluent and promiscuous American who, although accompanied by an older gentleman, gives him her address and telephone number.

Alfie returns to chauffeuring and drives a Rolls-Royce to the sanatorium to visit Harry. He finds Lily finishing a visit with her husband, who asks him to give his wife a ride back to London to save her an exhausting train ride. Neither initially wants to spend time together, but they agree in order to please Harry. Along the way, they stop for tea and then a canoe ride where Alfie seduces Lily.

Later, chauffeuring again, Alfie sees a young red-headed hitchhiker, Annie, who wants a fresh start in London. A lorry driver picks her up just before Alfie gets to her. He follows them to a cafe and steals her away to London. She moves into his bedsit where she proves preoccupied with a love left behind, scrubbing Alfie&#x27;s floor, doing his laundry and preparing his meals to compensate. The lorry driver finds Alfie in a pub and punches him in the face, causing a bar brawl.

Coming home with a black eye, Alfie grows resentful of Annie and drives her out with an angry outburst, immediately regretting it. Around the same time, Lily informs him that she is pregnant from their one encounter, and they plan for her to have an abortion. Lily comes to his flat to meet the abortionist. During the procedure, Alfie leaves Lily and walks around. He catches sight of his son Malcolm outside a church and witnesses the baptism of Gilda and Humphrey&#x27;s new daughter. The abortion traumatizes both Lily and Alfie; he breaks down in tears when seeing the aborted fetus, the first time he confronts the consequences of his actions.

Stressed by the situations with Annie and Lily, Alfie decides to change his non-committal ways and settle down with Ruby. However, visiting her, he finds a younger man in her bed. He comes across Siddie, but she has lost interest in him and returned to her husband. Alfie is left lonely, wondering about his life choices and the meaning of existence. A stray dog approaches him, and he takes it in his care as he walks off into the night.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Director Lewis Gilbert bought the film rights with Leslie Grade. Grade sold his share to James Woolf, who wanted Laurence Harvey to play the role. Gilbert did not think Harvey would be right, but agreed only if Harvey played in the play on Broadway first. Harvey refused, electing to appear in &quot;Camelot&quot; instead.

Gilbert was going to make &quot;No Bail for the Judge&quot; with George Peppard for Paramount, but the film fell over. Since Paramount still paid Gilbert his fee, Gilbert offered to make &quot;Alfie&quot; for them instead at half his usual fee. Terence Stamp read the script and wanted to do it for a reduced fee, which made Paramount happy as Stamp was doing &quot;The Collector&quot; for William Wyler. Gilbert insisted Stamp do the play on Broadway and Stamp agreed; the play flopped. &quot;He really was bad,&quot; said Gilbert of Stamp, &quot;he didn&#x27;t have the experience.&quot; Stamp decided not to do the film. Gilbert says his son suggested Michael Caine who was a friend. Gilbert admired Caine&#x27;s work in &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; and managed to get him approved by Paramount.

===Casting===
Vivien Merchant was a last minute replacement for Rachel Roberts, who had to drop out because her father was ill.

===Filming===
It was shot at Twickenham Studios with scenes shot at several locations in London; including Waterloo Bridge which is seen at the beginning and end of the film where the title character walks into the distance accompanied by a stray dog and Tower Bridge which is the backdrop for the photography scene with Shelley Winters.

===Title sequences===
The film is unusual in that it has no opening credits and the end credits feature photos of the principal actors, as well as of the main technical crew, including director Gilbert and cameraman Otto Heller.

===Music===
The original film soundtrack featured jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins with London musicians including Stan Tracey on piano, who improvised &quot;Little Malcolm Loves His Dad&quot; (although never credited), Rick Laird on bass, Phil Seamen on drums, Ronnie Scott on tenor sax.

The Sonny Rollins album &quot;Alfie&quot;, orchestrated and conducted by Oliver Nelson, was recorded in the United States in January 1966. It features Rollins with J.J. Johnson – trombone (tracks 1 &amp; 2), Jimmy Cleveland – trombone (tracks 3–6), Phil Woods – alto saxophone, Bob Ashton – tenor saxophone, Danny Bank – baritone saxophone, Roger Kellaway – piano, Kenny Burrell – guitar, Walter Booker – bass and Frankie Dunlop – drums

The title song, &quot;Alfie&quot;, written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, was sung by Cher over the film&#x27;s closing credits in the US release reaching #32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It became a hit for British singer Cilla Black (Millicent Martin sang &quot;Alfie&quot; on its British release) and for Madeline Eastman and Dionne Warwick.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 97%, based on reviews from 29 critics, with an average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Anchored by Michael Caine&#x27;s charmingly droll performance, Alfie is an equally raucous and heart-rending portrait of romance in the Swinging &#x27;60s.&quot;

Bosley Crowther, film reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, singled out Vivien Merchant&#x27;s acting for particular praise:
The film was a huge box office hit. Lewis Gilbert says the film&#x27;s success prompted Charles Bluhdorn (who bought Paramount Pictures in 1966) to make &quot;around twenty pictures&quot; without stars around $500,000 &quot;and they all died&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
The 1966 film was followed by &quot;Alfie Darling&quot; (1975), with Alan Price replacing Caine. An updated 2004 remake starred Jude Law in the title role.

<doc id="98506" wikidata="Q1215857" url="?curid=98506" title="The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming">
<text>The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming is a 1966 American comedy film directed and produced by Norman Jewison for United Artists. The satirical story depicts the chaos following the grounding of the Soviet submarine &quot;СпруT&quot; (“SpruT”, pronounced &quot;sproot&quot; and meaning &quot;octopus&quot;) off a small New England island. The film stars Alan Arkin in his first major film role, Carl Reiner, Eva Marie Saint, Brian Keith, Theodore Bikel, Jonathan Winters, John Phillip Law, Tessie O&#x27;Shea, and Paul Ford.

The screenplay is based on the 1961 Nathaniel Benchley novel &quot;The Off-Islanders&quot;, and was adapted for the screen by William Rose. The title alludes to Paul Revere&#x27;s midnight ride, as does the subplot in which the town drunk (Ben Blue) rides his horse to warn people of the &quot;invasion&quot;.

The film premiered on May 25, 1966, and was a widespread critical and commercial success. At the 39th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor for Alan Arkin. It also won two Golden Globes, for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Arkin.

==Plot==
One September morning, the Soviet Navy submarine &quot;Sprut&quot; draws too close to the New England coast when its captain wants to see North America and runs aground on a sandbar near Gloucester Island, off the New England coast, with a population of about 200 people. Rather than radio for help and risk an embarrassing international incident, the captain sends a nine-man landing party, headed by his &quot;zampolit&quot; Lieutenant Yuri Rozanov, to find a motor launch to help free the submarine. The men arrive at the house of Walt Whittaker, a vacationing playwright from New York City. Whittaker is eager to get his wife Elspeth and children, Pete and Annie, off the island now that summer is over.

Pete tells his disbelieving dad that armed Russians are near the house, but Walt is soon met by Rozanov and one of his men, Alexei Kolchin, who identify themselves as strangers on the island and ask if there are any boats available. Walt is skeptical and asks if they are armed Russians. Startled, Rozanov admits that they are and pulls a gun on Walt. Rozanov promises no harm to the Whittakers if they surrender their station wagon. Elspeth provides the car keys, but before the Russians depart, Rozanov orders Alexei to prevent the Whittakers from fleeing.

The station wagon quickly runs out of gasoline, forcing the Russians to walk. They steal an old sedan from Muriel Everett, the postmistress; she calls Alice Foss, the gossipy telephone switchboard operator, and soon, rumors about Russian parachutists and an air assault on the airport throw the island into confusion. Police Chief Link Mattocks and his assistant Norman Jonas try to squelch a citizens&#x27; militia led by Fendall Hawkins.

Meanwhile, Walt, Elspeth and Pete overpower Alexei when Alison Palmer, an 18-year-old neighbor and Annie&#x27;s babysitter, arrives for work, giving them an opening. Alexei flees, but when Walt, Elspeth, and Pete leave to find help, he returns to retrieve his weapon from the house, where only Alison and Annie remain. Despite wanting no fighting, Alexei must obey his superiors in guarding the residence. He promises not to harm anyone and offers to surrender his gun as proof. Alison trusts him and does not want his firearm.

Walt is recaptured by the Russians in the telephone central office. After subduing Mrs. Foss, tying Walt and her together, and disabling the island&#x27;s telephone switchboard, seven Russians appropriate civilian clothes from a dry cleaner&#x27;s, steal a cabin cruiser, and head to the submarine. Back at the Whittaker house, Alexei and Alison talk, kiss, and fall in love. At the phone exchange, Walt and Mrs. Foss hop outside the office. They are eventually discovered by Elspeth and Pete, who untie them. They return to their house, and Walt shoots at and almost kills Rozanov, who reached there ahead of them. With the misunderstandings cleared up, the Whittakers, Rozanov, and Alexei decide to head into town together to explain to everyone what is happening.

As the tide rises, the sub floats off the sandbar and proceeds on the surface to the island&#x27;s main harbor. Chief Mattocks, having investigated and debunked the rumor of an aerial assault, returns to town with the civilian militia. With Rozanov acting as translator, the Russian captain threatens to open fire on the town unless the seven missing sailors are returned to him; his crew faces upwards of a hundred armed townspeople. Two small boys eventually climb up to the church steeple to see better and one slips and falls, but his belt catches on a gutter, leaving him hanging 40 feet in the air. The American islanders and the Russian submariners unite to form a human pyramid and rescue him.

Peace is established between the two parties. However, Hawkins contacted the Air Force by radio. In a joint decision, the submarine leaves the harbor with villagers in boats protecting it. Alexei says goodbye to Alison. The stolen boat with the missing Russians meets the sub, which they board, before two Air Force jets arrive. The jets, however, break off after seeing the escorting flotilla of small craft. The &quot;Sprut&quot; is free to proceed to deep water and safety.

==Cast==

=== The Russians ===
==Production==
Although set on the fictional &quot;Gloucester Island&quot; off the coast of Massachusetts, the movie was filmed on the coast of Northern California, mainly in Mendocino. The harbor scenes were filmed in Noyo Harbor in Fort Bragg, California, about 7 miles (11 km) north of Mendocino. Because of the filming location on the West Coast, the dawn scene at the beginning of the film was actually filmed at dusk through a pink filter.

The submarine used was a fabrication. The United States Navy refused to lend one for the production, so the producers asked the Russian Embassy for a Soviet submarine, which was similarly refused. The Mirisch Company rented a mockup of a submarine that had been used in the 1965 film &quot;Morituri&quot;.

The planes used were actual F-101 Voodoo jets from the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, located at the nearby Hamilton Air Force Base. They were the only Air Force planes that were based near the location of the supposed island.

The title alludes to Paul Revere&#x27;s midnight ride, as does the subplot in which the town drunk (Ben Blue) rides his horse to warn people of the &quot;invasion&quot;.

Pablo Ferro created the main title sequence, using the American flag&#x27;s red, white, and blue colors and the Soviet hammer and sickle as transitional elements, zooming into each to create a montage, which ultimately worked to establish the tone of the film. The music in the sequence alternates between the American &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; march and a combination of the Russian songs &quot;Polyushko Pole&quot; (Полюшко Поле, usually &quot;Meadowlands&quot; in English) and the &quot;Song of the Volga Boatmen&quot;.

Much of the dialog was spoken by the Russian characters, played by American actors at a time when few American actors were adept at Russian accents. Musician and character actor Leon Belasco — who was born in Russia, spoke fluent Russian and specialized in foreign accents during his 60-year career — was the dialog director. Alan Arkin extensively studied Russian in preparation for his role as Lt. Rozanov. As of 2017, he could still remember his Russian lines from the film. Theodore Bikel was able to pronounce Russian so well (he had taken a few classes, but was not at all fluent in the language) that he won the role of the submarine captain. Alex Hassilev, of The Limeliters, also spoke fluent Russian and played the sailor Hrushevsky. John Phillip Law&#x27;s incorrect pronunciation of difficult English phonemes, most notably in Alison Palmer&#x27;s name (&quot;ah-LYEE-sown PAHL-myerr&quot;), was unusually authentic by the standards of the day. Brian Keith, who also spoke fluent Russian, did not do so in the film.

==Musical score and soundtrack==

The film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Johnny Mandel and the soundtrack album was released on the United Artists label in 1966. &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; reviewed Mandel&#x27;s soundtrack in their liner notes for their reissue of the score, noting the presence of Russian folk songs, writing that &quot;These pre-existing melodies mix with original Mandel compositions, including a Russian choral anthem, a humorous march theme for the island residents&#x27; quasi-military response to the Soviet incursion, and a tender love theme...&quot;. &quot;The Shining Sea&quot; was sung on the soundtrack by Irene Kral, although it had featured as an instrumental in the film itself. The lyrics to &quot;The Shining Sea&quot; were written by Peggy Lee, who was contractually bound to Capitol Records, and so unable to appear on the soundtrack album. The line &quot;His hands, his strong brown hands&quot; was believed by Lee&#x27;s friends to be a reference to Quincy Jones with whom she had a brief affair. Lee herself later recorded &quot;The Shining Sea&quot; with her lyrics on May 21, 1966. Mandel had played the music for &quot;The Shining Sea&quot; to Lee, and had asked her to &quot;paint a word picture&quot; of what she had heard. Lee&#x27;s lyrics, by coincidence, exactly matched the action on the screen of the two lovers on the beach, which astonished Mandel, who had not shown her the film.

==Reception==
Robert Alden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a rousingly funny – and perceptive – motion picture about a desperately unfunny world situation.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; declared it &quot;an outstanding cold-war comedy,&quot; adding that Jewison &quot;has made expert use of all types of comedy technique, scripted and acted in excellent fashion by both pros and some talented newcomers to pix.&quot;

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Considering that it is made up of variations on a single theme, the picture is astonishingly inventive. And considering that it was never done as a play on the stage (where laughs can be pre-tested and rough spots ironed out) it racks up a high average indeed, though it has its lapses and some of its points are forced—over-milked, as they say in the trade.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a refreshingly witty topical comedy ... Some exceptionally skilled comics, familiar and unfamiliar, are extremely amusing.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the film &quot;almost falls flat when it indulges in sententious philosophising about the need for Russians and Americans to live peacefully together,&quot; but is &quot;considerably helped by an amiable script (by former Ealing writer William Rose) which often manages to invest the film with the high farce of the best of the Ealing comedies.&quot; Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;an unfunny big farce  ... The heavy-handed producer and director of the picture, Norman Jewison, has permitted nearly every moment of it to become twice as brightly colored, twice as noisy, and twice as frantic as it needed to be; this is all the more a pity, because the cast includes a number of excellent comic actors.&quot;

According to Norman Jewison, the film — released at the height of the Cold War — had considerable impact in both Washington and Moscow. It was one of the few American films of the time to portray the Russians in a positive light. Senator Ernest Gruening mentioned the film in a speech in Congress, and a copy of it was screened in the Kremlin. According to Jewison, when screened at the Soviet film writers&#x27; union, Sergei Bondarchuk was moved to tears. Jewison, in an interview, also stated that not only were the Russians thrilled with the movie, they were a little disappointed they hadn&#x27;t thought of the plot first.

<text>The Sand Pebbles is a 1966 American epic war film directed by Robert Wise in Panavision. It tells the story of an independent, rebellious U.S. Navy machinist&#x27;s mate first class, aboard the fictional river gunboat USS &quot;San Pablo&quot;, on Yangtze Patrol in 1920s China. The production was filmed on location in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The film stars Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, Richard Crenna, and Candice Bergen, and features Marayat Andriane, Mako, and Larry Gates in supporting roles. Robert Anderson adapted the screenplay from the 1962 novel of the same name by Richard McKenna.

&quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; was a critical and commercial success during its general release. It became the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1966, and was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steve McQueen, his only Oscar nomination, and eight Golden Globe Awards, with Attenborough winning the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor.

==Plot==
In 1926 China during its Warlord Era, Navy Machinist&#x27;s Mate First Class Jake Holman transfers to the Yangtze River Patrol gunboat USS &quot;San Pablo&quot; as their new engineer. Almost immediately, he upsets the crew when he will not accept the unofficial Chinese workers they use to do most of their duties. Instead, Holman takes personal responsibility of the engine room. He befriends a seasoned sailor named Frenchy.

After an engine malfunction caused by a problem Holman noticed, but the captain refused to repair, the chief Chinese engine-room worker dies. Lop-eye Shing, leader of all the Chinese workers onboard, blames Holman. The captain tells Holman he must find a Chinese replacement, so he chooses the simple but genial Po-Han.

The sailors on shore leave visit a bar and brothel run by a former sailor. A high-priced virgin named Maily captivates the crew. Frenchy discovers that her price is the debt she must pay to get her freedom.

Holman&#x27;s nemesis Stawski conspires with Shing to get Po-Han kicked off the boat by having a boxing match; if Stawski wins, he gets the money needed for Maily, but if he loses, Po-Han keeps his job. Stawski is almost beaten when the alarm sounds, forcing the crew to rush back to their boat. A Chinese mob has been angered that British warships have fought a battle with Chinese warlords on the Yangtze River.

When the Chinese Civil War begins, the &quot;San Pablo&quot; is ordered to remain neutral, while rescuing stranded Americans up river. Po-han is sent ashore by Shing while the sailors collect Jameson, a missionary, and Shirley Eckert, his schoolteacher assistant. After being caught by a mob, Holman violates the captain&#x27;s orders to stay neutral by shooting Po-Han to end his brutal death on shore.

Back in port, Chinese locals openly show their hatred towards the sailors. Jameson and Eckert head off to a new mission. Frenchy tries to buy Maily&#x27;s freedom, but instead she is put up for auction. Holman tries to help Frenchy pay the higher price, but a fight breaks out. The three of them escape. Frenchy and Maily have an unofficial marriage in an empty church. Holman and Eckert start to meet and fall in love, but he thinks it cannot last, as he will likely be leaving China soon.

As winter comes, the boat becomes stuck as the river level drops. Shore leave is cancelled when the Chinese workers abandon the crew. To see Maily, Frenchy regularly swims the freezing waters, but eventually he catches pneumonia and dies. Antiforeign Chinese forces kill Maily and frame Holman for her murder. They surround the ship and demand his surrender. With tensions rising and the crew also demanding Holman leave, the captain fires a Lewis gun, ending the matter.

The captain decides to rescue Jameson and Eckert from their new mission after hearing of antiforeigner riots in Nanking. However, the &quot;San Pablo&quot; encounters a line of tethered junks blocking their way sparking an armed conflict. Under fire, Holman chops through the rope. He kills a Chinese militiaman only to recognize the young man as one of Jameson&#x27;s and Shirley&#x27;s students.

The gunboat arrives at the mission, but Jameson and Shirley Eckert refuse to leave. While they argue, Nationalist soldiers attack, killing Jameson. The patrol retreats, but when its officer is killed, Holman takes command. Shirley and he affirm their love; Holman promises to follow while covering their escape. He kills several soldiers, but is fatally shot as he is about to rejoin the others. A dying Holman bewilderingly asks, &quot;I was Home ... what happened? What the hell happened?&quot;

Shirley and the remaining sailors reach the boat. The &quot;San Pablo&quot; slowly steams away.

==Cast==
Former child actor and career naval officer Frank Coghlan, Jr., was the film&#x27;s U.S. Navy technical advisor; he made an uncredited appearance as an American businessman.

==Production==
===Development===
For years, Robert Wise had wanted to make &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, but the film companies were reluctant to finance it. &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; was eventually financed by Twentieth Century-Fox, but because its production required extensive location scouting and preproduction work, as well as being affected by a monsoon in Taipei, its producer and director Wise realized that principal photography could not begin for more than a year. At the insistence of Fox, Wise agreed to direct a &quot;fill-in&quot; project, the Academy Award-winning &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

===Preproduction===
Fox spent $250,000 building a replica gunboat named the &quot;San Pablo&quot;, based on the — a former Spanish Navy gunboat that was seized by the U.S. Navy in the Philippine Islands during the Spanish–American War (1898–1899) — but with a greatly reduced draft to allow sailing on the shallow Tam Sui and Keelung Rivers. The replica&#x27;s final design was closer to that of 1928 river gunboats than that of the &quot;Villalobos&quot;. A seaworthy vessel that was actually powered by Cummins diesel engines, the &quot;San Pablo&quot; made the voyage from Hong Kong to Taiwan and back under her own power during shooting of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;. After filming was completed, the &quot;San Pablo&quot; was sold to the DeLong Timber Company and renamed the &quot;Nola D&quot;, then later sold to Seiscom Delta Exploration Co., which used it as a floating base camp with significant modifications, including removal of its engines and the addition of a helipad. The boat was towed to Singapore and broken up in 1975.

Robert Wise&#x27;s cinematographer from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, Ted McCord, had taken a scouting trip to the Asian locations, but he informed Wise that his heart problems made him not capable enough to shoot the film.

===Filming===
&quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; was filmed in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Its filming, which began on November 22, 1965, in Keelung, was scheduled to take about nine weeks, but it ended up taking seven months. The cast and crew took a break for the Christmas holidays in Tamsui, Taipei.

At one point, a 15-foot camera boat capsized on the Keelung River, setting back the schedule because the soundboard was ruined when it sank. When the filming was finally completed in Taiwan, the government of the Republic of China was rumored to have held the passports of several cast members because of unpaid additional taxes. In March 1966, the filming moved to Hong Kong and Shaw Brothers Studio for three months, mainly for scenes in Sai Kung and Tung Chung. In June, production traveled to Hollywood to finish its interior scenes at Fox Studios.

Due to frequent rain and other difficulties in Hong Kong, the filming was halted and nearly abandoned. McQueen had developed an abscessed molar and returned to California because he did not wish to be treated in Hong Kong. By the time he received treatment in Los Angeles, he was very ill and was ordered by his dentist and physician to take an extended period of rest, one that further delayed production for several more weeks.

Some filming took place on the dreadnought-type battleship USS &quot;Texas&quot;, but these scenes were cut from the final film.
After more than 40 years, 20th Century Fox found 14 minutes of footage that had been cut from the film&#x27;s initial roadshow version shown at New York&#x27;s Rivoli Theatre. The restored version has been released on DVD. The sequences are spread throughout the film and add texture to the story, though they do not alter it in any significant way.

==Themes and background==
The military life of the &quot;San Pablo&quot;&#x27;s crew, the titular &quot;Sand Pebbles&quot;, portrays the era&#x27;s culture and colonialism on a small scale through the sailors&#x27; relations with the coolies, who run their gunboat, and the bargirls, who serve them off-duty, as well as, on a large scale, with the West&#x27;s gunboat diplomacy domination of China.

Although the 1962 novel antedated extensive U.S. activity in Vietnam, and was not based on any historic incidents, by the December 1966 release of the film, it was seen as an explicit statement on the U.S.&#x27;s extensive combat involvement in the Vietnam War in reviews published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;.

==Release==
It rained the night of the premiere, December 20, 1966, at the Rivoli Theatre, 750 Seventh Avenue, New York City. Afterward, McQueen did not do any film work for about a year due to exhaustion, saying that whatever sins he had committed in his life had been paid for when he made &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;. He was not seen on film again until two 1968 films, &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; and &quot;Bullitt&quot;.

According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $21,200,000 in rentals to break even, and by December 1970, made $20,600,000. In September 1970, the studio recorded a loss of $895,000 on the movie.

==Reception==
The film was acclaimed by a wide array of critics. The film has an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a beautifully mounted film&quot; with &quot;a curiously turgid and uneven attempt to generate a war romance&quot;. Crowther wrote, &quot;It is not as historical romance that it is likely to grab the audience, but as a weird sort of hint of what has happened and is happening in Vietnam.&quot;

Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; declared it &quot;a handsome production, boasting some excellent characterizations. Steve McQueen delivers an outstanding performance.&quot;

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;adventure on the grand scale, of a kind on which the British have too long enjoyed an exclusive monopoly. &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; earns a place up there beside &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, et al ... Too, the parallel with 1966 and Vietnam could hardly be more timely.&quot;

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a strong story with highly unusual backgrounds, a character perfectly suited to Steve McQueen, and an engrossing drive that falters only because three hours is a bit much.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;History, of course, never really repeats itself in the way script-writers would like it to, and the parallel between China in 1926 and Vietnam today is distinctly dubious. But this striking of attitudes is the film&#x27;s undoing, since it seriously undermines the narrative by presenting the characters as little more than pawns in a didactic chess game. And in any case, the script never decides which side of the political fence it wants to sit on.&quot;

Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that McQueen &quot;works hard and well&quot; in his role, but described Robert Wise&#x27;s direction as &quot;molasses-in-January&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
The performance earned Steve McQueen the only Academy Award nomination of his career.

<text>Efik mythology consists of a collection of myths narrated, sung or written down by the Efik people and passed down from generation to generation. Sources of Efik mythology include bardic poetry, art, songs, oral tradition and proverbs. Stories concerning Efik myths include creation myths, supernatural beings, mythical creatures, and warriors.
Efik myths were initially told by Efik people and narrated under the moonlight. Myths, legends and historical stories are known in Efik as while moonlight plays in Efik are known as .

==Sources==
===Historical literature===
Since the inception of the triangular trade, the Efik people have been in the limelight of historical scholarship. Several works have centred on different aspects of Efik culture and tradition. Although little focus has been made on the subject of Efik mythology, several works have been written on aspects relating to Efik mythology. The earliest Efik dictionary by Rev Hugh Goldie reveals a number of mythical animals and places. Goldie&#x27;s Principle of Efik Grammar is also the goto for the Efik creation story. Works such as Rosalind Hackett&#x27;s religion in Calabar discuss some Efik deities. Percy Talbot&#x27;s &quot;Life in Southern Nigeria&quot; is also useful in the study of Efik and Ibibio mythology.

===Art===
Art is an underemphasized contributor to Efik mythology. Efik beliefs in Ndem and Ekpe were transmitted via engravings on Brass plates (Akpangkpang). Prior to the depiction of myths, events and stories on Brass plates, Efik women mainly engaged in decorating houses with geometric designs of various kinds. Women were regarded as the artisans in Old Calabar society. Mr Ironbar also known as Edem Ndarake is regarded as the father of Brass Art in Efik history. The wives of Ironbar were active members of the Calabash engraving industry at Old Calabar. The women would create beautifully finished products which would then be taken as souvenirs from Old Calabar by English traders. However, these products particularly the calabashes were fragile and several goods did not arrive England safely. Mr Ironbar chose to solve the matter by choosing to transfer the designs to Brass which was more durable. After several negotiations with English traders, iron bars were imported from Europe to aid in the manufacture of brass products such as trays, dishes and basins. Several brass dishes were designed with images of Efik deities. These dishes aid in the description of deities and also depict animals that are symbolic to the deities.

===Songs===
Religious songs used in reverence to Ndem and Ekpe contribute to the understanding of Efik mythology. These songs show praise and reverence for the various Ndem. An example of a song is mentioned below:

The song above mentions the names of several important Efik deities and declares respect and honour for them. Among the list of deities mentioned in the song are , , , , and . References to the mythical tailed pygmies known in the Efik language as Amamaisim can also be deciphered in the 8th and final stanza of the song.

===Efik Literature===

Efik literature is a major source of mythology. A variety of myths can be found within Efik literature ranging from creation myths to tales of mythical places and monsters. Early Efik writers often inserted many mythical tales within their writings. Aspects of Efik literature that contain myths include Uto (bardic poetry), Mbuk (stories), Ase (commemorative poetry) and Nke (folktales, riddles and proverbs).

====Folktales====
Writers such as E.N. Amaku, Esien-Ekpe Edet Okon, E.E. Nkaña and several others capture several myths in their literary works. Myths may also function as sources of stereotypes. For example, the myth of Akpa Uyok is captured in a poem by Mbukpa E. Eyo. Akpa Uyok is believed to have been an Efik chief who lived for so long that the Efik people sought to get rid of him. They get rid of Akpa Uyok by leaving him in a canoe and abandoning him by a river bank with the hope that the tides will take his canoe away. Akpa Uyok is said to have solicited the aid of three Efik deities against his offenders and curses them denying them the benefits of a ripe old age. 
====Bardic poetry====
Bardic poetry is an important aspect of Efik culture and literature. Prior to the inception of the Efik Alphabets, Efik literature was mainly oral. Bardic or Epic poetry was recited in the Efik language by knowledgeable bards who were experts in recounting events that occurred in Efik history. These recollected events often contain myths and legends. According to Aye, &quot;At night, a secret society, Ekpri Akata, with the use of certain mechanisms to disguise their voices, sang or repeated some satirical poetry aimed at holding up people&#x27;s vices or follies to ridicule, or lampooning against certain individuals. There were also songs of lamentation at the death of a dear one. The stock of subjects for the poetry was drawn from the actual present.&quot; Some popular myths recalled during such epic poetry include the death of Akpa Uyok, the disappearance of Otu Asiya, the events of Efik-Portuguese interrelations. Some Efik bards of the early 20th century were Adiaha Etim Anwa Anwa, Atim Etayong, Okpok Ndem Ndem, Nne Eke Mkpananie, Etim Anwa Etim Nsa.

==Classes of Efik Mythology==
===Creation myth===
The creation story of the Efik reveals characters such as Abasi, Atai and the first humans. It is believed that Abasi first created the earth and later created the first humans; a man and a woman. Abasi did not let the first humans live on earth because he wanted no one to contend with him. Abasi&#x27;s wife Atai disagreed with him and insisted that Man and woman should live on earth. Abasi gave the humans permission to live on earth but ordered that the Humans should not cultivate their own food but should dine in the heavens whenever a bell is rung. Abasi also ordered that the man and woman should not procreate. This second instruction was given so that the humans would never forget Abasi. Each day, a bell would be rung and the humans would visit the heavens to dine with Abasi. The law prohibiting the cultivation of crops of Earth was first broken by the woman. The woman cultivated plants and used them to cook food which she served to the man. The man and woman also broke Abasi&#x27;s second command by sleeping together and having intercourse. The next time the bell was rung, the man came alone. Abasi asked the man where his wife was located, the man lied, saying she was unwell. In reality, the man had hidden his wife because she was pregnant. The woman had borne a son and later bore a daughter. Abasi was aware of what had transpired on Earth and told Atai that the humans had broken his laws, had neglected and forgotten him. Atai reassured Abasi that the humans would never forget Abasi and sent death into the world.
Some versions of the story attest that Atai killed the man and his wife while other versions employ a form of poetic language attesting that Atai sent chaos and death into the world. The names of the first humans are not given but Burton attests that the earliest humans may have been known as Esefe and Ọkpọrọ, as there are names which featured often in Efik proverbs.

===Myths on deities===

Abasi is regarded as the supreme being, the all powerful being who created everything. In the creation story of the Efik, Abasi is depicted as a loving father who desires to have a personal relationship with the Humans. When the man lies to Abasi that the woman is unwell to hide her sin, Abasi is already aware that the man and woman have broken the laws. Abasi&#x27;s knowledge of the affairs on earth reveals his trait as all-knowing and all-seeing. Abasi is also depicted as a listening husband who takes into consideration the advice of his wife. The Efik originally believed that Abasi was too high up in the heavens and was unbothered by the affairs of man. Such beliefs may have been used in the past as justification for the worship of Ndem, whom the Efik believed had more connection with the earth. In some Efik myths, there exists a concept of a triune God. is regarded as the father of Abasi who gave birth to two sons and . Burton hypothesises that Abasi Ibom and Inyang Ibom are personifications of Earth and Water.

Atai is regarded as the wife of the supreme being Abasi Ibom. She is featured prominently in the creation story of the Efik as an all-powerful goddess who desires the utmost satisfaction of her husband, Abasi. In the Efik creation story, she suggests to Abasi that man should inhabit the Earth. This part of the story reveals two contradicting views towards the future of man. While Abasi desires that man and woman should live in the heavens, Atai suggests that they reside on earth. The creation story reveals Atai as one whose suggestion is invaluable in the abode of Abasi. Atai is therefore regarded as a decisionmaker in Abasi&#x27;s kingdom. Atai is later saddened when she realises that things did not turn out the way, her husband expected for the humans. She sends death and chaos to the world with aim of ensuring that the humans never forget God and are rejoined with him in the heavens. Atai is also regarded as the messenger of Abasi. She is believed to be represented on earth by the Vulture which is known in the Efik language as Utere and nicknamed &quot;Atai Abasi&quot;. There is no evidence to suggest that the Efik worshipped Atai. This would be unlikely as Atai&#x27;s principal desire is that her husband should be worshipped. However, the Efik determine the presence of a vulture as a sign from Abasi which further affirms the theory that Atai was not just a decision maker but a messenger of Abasi. During sacrifices to Abasi, the presence of the vulture at the end of the sacrifice meant that the sacrifice had been accepted by Abasi. The story of Atai sending death and chaos into the world may also explain why the vulture is nicknamed &quot;Atai Abasi&quot;. Vultures are often found in places where death has taken place. In the traditional kingship of the Efik, the wife of the Edidem is known as Atai Abasi. The reason for the title assigned to the first wife of the Edidem is that the Edidem is regarded as a representative of Abasi on earth. Therefore, his wife is regarded as the voice of Atai, Abasi&#x27;s principal wife.

Eka Abasi is regarded as the goddess of Fertility in Efik mythology. She is greatly revered and equally dreaded. Although the name Eka Abasi literally translates to &quot;Mother of God&quot;, she is not believed to be an actual relative of God but is so-called because she possesses the power of giving children to her followers. Eka Abasi was worshipped by the Efik and the Ibibio but is viewed differently between both ethnic groups. Among the Ibibio, Eka Abasi is regarded as the great mother whom by her own might, gave birth to Obuma, the god of thunder.

====Ndem====
Marine deities also known as Ndem (Singular: Idem) form a principal part of Efik traditional religion. The Ndem are regarded as territorial in character as they are believed to reside in several areas in the lower Cross River. Among the Ndem include Udominyan, Anansa, Atabrinyang, Atakpor Uruan Inyang, Afianwan, Ekpenyong, Ekanem and several others. Although Ndem are regarded as territorial, certain Ndem are believed to be present in several other locations while still headquartered at one site. Among these would include Atakpor Uruan Inyang. This is further confirmed in the Uruan saying: &quot;Ke Ndem Efik Iboku, Atakpọr Ndem Uruan ke Ekụk&quot;, which can be interpreted to mean &quot;Where there is the Efik deity, there is also Atakpor Uruan to share with it.&quot; Many Ndem are described as possessing extremely beautiful features, among them is the deity Udominyang. Udominyang is a symbol of beauty and is believed to reside at the bottom of the river where she possesses a fine mansion. Udominyang is also believed to possess a lot of wealth as she obtains everything that falls into the river from capsized ships and canoes. She is depicted on several brass trays as possessing a fish body with a woman&#x27;s head and upper torso. Another principal deity is Anansa also known as Anansa Ikang Obutong or Anansa Ikot Obutong or Anansa Enwang. Anansa is exalted in many Efik songs, one of the most popular was sung by Chief Inyang Nta Henshaw. She is believed to reside at the head of a spring or river near the Hope Waddell Training Institution. Ekpenyong may be regarded as a national deity in the area formerly known as Eburutu. By the 17th century, the cult of Ekpenyong was quickly spreading from the focal point which was Old Calabar. Ekpenyong or Ekpenyong Abasi is known by several names. At Arochukwu, it was known as Ekpenyong Ibritam; Ibn Ukpabi and Ibitam inokon. The deity was mainly worshipped by riverine communities such as Eniong, Uruan, Ito, Ukwa, Idere and several others. Among the Efik, Ekpenyong is regarded as the custodian of Nsibidi. Although Ekpenyong is regarded as a marine deity, his spirit is believed to reside in a tree known as Ekom. Some Efik communities such as Mbiabo Ikot Offiong believe that his spirit dwells in the cotton tree known in Efik as . At Mbiabo Ikot Offiong, Ekpenyong is believed to have had a son known as Akpan Ekpenyong. Unlike Ekpenyong, Akpan Ekpenyong is believed to reside in the water. Just as Ekpenyong is believed to have bore a son, he is also believed to be married to the deity Ekanem Abasi. The worship of Ekanem was also prominent in the lower Cross River but the cult of Ekanem did not travel as far as the cult of Ekpenyong. In many Efik folktales, Ekpenyong and Ekanem are featured as the supreme god and goddess. Like Ekpenyong, the spirit of Ekanem is also believed to inhabit a cotton tree.

As Ndem are primarily marine deities, most of its emblems are aquatic creatures. Among these creatures include python, alligator and crocodile. The species of Crocodile known in the Efik language as represents Atabrinyang, a deity believed to reside at Effiat. The black kite is regarded as the messenger of Atakpor Uruan. Marriages are also believed to occur among the Ndem. Anansa Ikang Obutong is believed to be the spouse of Anantigha Enwang. Atakpor Uruan is also believed to be the spouse of Atabrinyang. Other unions between Ndem include Obo and Eme; Ebebe and Ukọñ Esụk.
===Myths on the Origin of Ekpe===

The Ekpe society plays a prominent role in Efik society. During the Pre-colonial era, Ekpe was the government of the day at Old Calabar. The society operates via a grading system. Some ekpe grades include Nyamkpe, Okuakama, Okpoho, Mboko and Mboko Mboko. As much as Ekpe acted as the preserver of law and order in Efik society, the society is also grounded in esoteric rituals. Ekpe is the Efik word for &quot;Leopard&quot; and is believed to be a mysterious being or spirit residing in the forest. According to Savage,&quot;...despite the fact that Ekpe is a forest spirit, very often when Ekpe chiefs go to bring it from the forest to the village, town or shrine, they do so by means of a canoe. Thus this forest spirit is convened by water transport to land.&quot; It is also believed that only the initiates of the Ekpe society can see the Ekpe spirit. Several legends surround the founding of Ekpe. One legend as documented by Donald Simmons in 1958 states:
An Efut woman named Ata Iroko observed several supernatural spirits playing in the forest. When they departed they left behind the mbɔkɔ which Ata Iroko found and took home. This is the instrument which produces a sound similar to a leopard roar and knowledge of its mechanism constitutes the greatest secret of the Leopard Sooioty, Ata Iroko took the mbɔkɔ to her husband, who showed it to the town chiefs. They were so captivated they Immediately bribed the husband to kill his wife so that no woman would know of the mechanism. Accordingly, the husband killed Ata Iroko, The Efik subsequently purchased the secrets of the Leopard Society from the Efut,
Donald Simmons also provides another narrative which states that Ata Iroko was shown the secrets of Mbɔkɔ by her father because he loved her so much. On the death of Chief Iroko, Ata and her husband fled with her husband from Usakedet to Calabar. Thereafter, Ata showed Mbɔkɔ to the chiefs who immediately decapitated her and her husband so that no one except the chiefs could dispense the secrets of Mbɔkɔ. Donald Simmons further asserts that when the Efik desire to produce the mbɔkɔ sound, they first make a sound similar which represents the name Ata Iroko. In spite of Simmons assertions, the names mainly called during Ekpe processions include Eyo Ema, Esien Ekpe, Asibong Ekondo, Mutaka and Nkok Ofuta. Another myth narrated in 1964 at the Hart&#x27;s Enquiry by Barrister E. Koofreh states, 
Asibong Ekondo discovered Ekpe floating on the river and he sold it to Esien Ekpe as his personal property. All the people of Usak Edet from where Asibong Ekondo hailed are reputed to be able to live under water and know what transpire there. Their souls normally lived underwater. Until recent times, they performed Ekpe plays under the water. When he sold the Ekpe to the Efiks whose souls do not live under water, Asibong Ekondo showed them how to use it.
Aspects of comparative mythology can be observed in the tale narrated by Koofreh. The Balondo of Cameroon equally narrate a similar tale regarding the origin of Ekpe. The Balondo of Cameroon call Ekpe, &quot;Matamu&quot;. According to Roschenthaler as quoted by Nanji: 
In the Balondo version, the women had been fishing, the women caught the Nyankpe from
fishing in the river, the women caught a giant fish. The head of the fish produced a growling sound. The women made it sing, but the women did not know how to drum it. They tried in vain to control the sound of the fish. Their drumming did not help. The men knew how to drum. Then later they cut the físh, took the head for themselves and gave the tail to the women. Whenever Butamu (Ekpe) escapes into the river or forest, only the women can get it back... The myth does not explain how the men made the society and what it looked like at the beginning. It only says that the men took Nyankpe from the women and made its growling voice the basis of a powerful association.

===Mythical Creatures===
Several mythical creatures can be found in Efik mythology. Such creatures are different from the Efik Ndem which equally have their own separate descriptions in folklore. Some of these creatures include Okukubarakpa (also known as Ukara-akpa), Akaka Obu, Animana, Ikọñwọ, Unanim and several others. Okukubarakpa is regarded as a monstrous serpent that stretches across the river disturbing the waters. The creature can be likened to the Leviathan or the Dragon. Okukubarakpa is described by E. U. Aye as, &quot;a large water serpent said to possess a diamond stone in its head and grows a comb on its head like that of a cock.&quot; The creature can be found in several folk tales of the people of the lower Cross River and certain parts of Cameroon. Talbot narrates a tale told to him regarding Okukubarakpa:

Two towns, which lay on either side of a narrow creek, had long been on unfriendly terms. After a while the inhabitants of one of these crossed over at low tide and attacked the other, thinking to gain an easy victory. Instead of this, after hard fighting, they themselves were driven back to the edge of the water, which had, meanwhile, risen so that they, were cut off from escape. Now, in the creek lived a great python named Kukubarakpa, and no sooner did he see the plight of the invaders than he laid himself bridge-wise across the water—his head on the one bank and his tail upon the other. Over his body fled the van¬ quished, and, when all were safely landed on the farther shore, the bravest of the victors tried to follow. Kukubarakpa waited until these were crossing over his body, then sank suddenly, dragging them down with him, so that all were drowned. In gratitude, none of the people whose ancestors were thus saved kill or eat python to this day.

Another creature, Ikpun kpun kpun Ine also known as Ọkpọñ ọkpọñ ọkpọñ is described as a mammoth-like creature far greater than the elephant but existing only in fables. Unanim is described as, &quot;a terrible prehistoric creature said to be extinct&quot;. Unanim is believed to have been aquatic and may have been an ancestor to a species of shark known as . Ikọñwọ is believed to be related to a species of catfish but was far monstrous. The Efik believed that Two giant crabs () both male and female, guarded the entrance to the Calabar river and protected Old Calabar.

===Mythical Human-like species===
Several mythical human-like species can be discovered in Efik folktales and legends. Among them include Amamaisim, the people of the woods and the undead. In all the legends of the people of the lower Cross River can be found the tale of a group of short pygymies with tails known by the name &quot;Amamaisim&quot;. Amamaisim which translates to &quot;they love their tails&quot; were short stunted pygmies with tails. A study of the various folktales and sparse literature across the lower Cross River define them as intelligent, with great farming, hunting and trading skills. Their most common hunting equipment was the bow and arrow. Several variations of the tale of Amamaisim can be found in almost all the lower Cross River communities which include the Efik (specifically those in Akpabuyo), Eniong, Eki, Ibibio and Oron.

Among the Efik, the Amamaisim were believed to have been first spotted at Akpabuyo. There is no evidence that suggests that the Efik met the Amamaisim at Ikpa ene, Ndodoghi, Uruan or on the Calabar coast. Records of such sitings were narrated to Colonial Anthropologist Jeffreys in the 1930s and attempts to document what was remembered about such sitings were made in the 1970s. Many Ibibio communities also narrate that these pygmies were the earliest inhabitants of the present-day Akwa Ibom. Enwang and Oron folktales talk of the war of the pygmies which scattered many communities. This was known in the Enwang language as &quot;Ekung Amamaisim-isim asuan ofid oduobot&quot; (The war of the pygmies has scattered the whole world). Among the Eniong, legend has it that the Amamaisim were the earliest inhabitants of Akani Obio Eniong. Some myths incorporate these creatures as members of the host of Ndem (Marine spirits). For example, in E.E.E. Okon&#x27;s Nkukunpoyoriyo he writes, &quot;Ofuri esien eki ekpono ndem Eki- Ebe ye ñwan nte Zeus ye Hera. Ebe ye nwan esie edi mme amamaisim; mmọ edu ke mmọñ. Ke mmọñ, mmọ edi owo; edọk obot ekabade Ekpọ itiaba&quot; (translation: All the clans of Eki worship Ndem Eki- Husband and Wife like Zeus and Hera. Husband and Wife are amamaisim; they inhabit the waters. In the water, they are people; they climb up the hill, they turn into Ekpọ itiaba (A demon that is seven times more diabolical i.e. A Hydra).
In the chants of Ndem adherents, references to these mysterious being may be heard, &quot;Ebe itip itip Nwan Itip Itip, itip itip idiaha nkpo utan enyon&quot;. Itipitip is the Efik word for dwarf. Some legends in Cameroon also mention pygmies but it is uncertain if the pygmies in the tales of the Bantu Cameroon actually had tails.

Many Efik folktales mention people who spring out of trees and fruits. The storyline in these folktales often involves a person who seeks a child and is fortunate to find one that emanates from a fruit or a tree. Talbot also narrates a tale of people being brought back to life by the Annang. These people when returned were regarded as having a non-energetic character. There were known in the Efik language as &quot;Owo emeade ke Ude esio&quot;.

===Myth on Bush soul===
Prior to the prominence of Christian beliefs in Efik society, the Efik believed in the soul&#x27;s affinity to animals. It was believed that every individual had a soul in an animal, could transfer their consciousness to the body of the animal and materialise as the animal. Children were taught never to kill a wall gecko (). Whatever occurred to the animal-affinity also occurred to the human. According to Rosalind Hackett who quotes Etubom Ewa Henshaw, &quot;There was a hierarchy of animals, the leopard being the highest followed by wild dogs, crocodiles, boa constrictors and other snakes, wall geckos and so on.&quot; Animals and some species of fish were regarded as potential affinities, but never plants, insects or rocks. The choice of the animal was made before birth and was influenced by Eka Abasi (The Mother God). A person&#x27;s personality and behavioural characteristics were considered to be determined by the animal soul. According to Simmons, A very slow person possessed the python as his animal-affinity while a filthy person had a pig affinity, A strong, healthy individual possessed either a crocodile or spitting cobra and the affinity of one who had many white discolorations on the skin was thought to be a species of lizard called owuri; such people had the ability to draw money to themselves at night when the lizard howled. If an Individual craved oil palm fruits he possessed either a monkey affinity or that of a fish called ɔfɔt. A very powerful Individual has the animal affinity of a chimpanzee.

===Mythical Places===
Several mythical places can be found in the Efik cosmology. The Efik believed that the world was flat as such, the edge of the world was known as Ononkoni ()). The Efik believed in the existence of a realm known as where the spirits of the dead reside. Ọnọsi is said to have been located around the village of Usahadet and was bordered by the realm of the Ndem (Marine deities) known as Obio Ndem. Obio Ndem was believed to be the meeting place of the society known as Ekongeze. Obio Ndem is described by Etinyin Andem Ita stating:

Obio Ndem is like a city on land with the only difference being that it is under water. Like us on land, they have roofed houses, families, markets, etc. The city is ruled by the deity overseeing the region. Sometimes, when people go missing while swimming, fishing or sojourning by water, sacrifices are offered to the deity overseeing the jurisdiction where the person went missing when such sacrifices are accepted, the person resurfaces back on land most times with no recollection of how he/she got there and other times with vague recollection of being held hostage in a city under the sea where people gathered and deliberated on what is to be done to the hostage.

===Myth on Witchcraft===
The Efik word for witchcraft is . The Efik believe that there are two types of i.e. (White witchcraft) and (Black witchcraft). White witchcraft is utilised for protective and positive purposes while black witchcraft is used to cause harm and destruction to others. A person possessing the power of white witchcraft never attempts to kill or hurt someone but protects people by exposing the possessors of black witchcraft. A practitioner of black witchcraft often causes death, sickness or loss of wealth to a person. Practitioners of white witchcraft often admit that they possess such power, while a practitioner of black witchcraft does not admit to possessing such power. Black witches are believed to join to form a society and meet at night to cause people harm. According to Simmons, Under ordinary conditions they are only visible to possessors of white witchcraft, but when they congregate at night they are visible to everyone and reported to be red in color. This is due to the removal of their skin which they leave at home to make people think that they are asleep while they go outside to dance in their raw flesh.
Some nocturnal animals are often associated with practitioners of witchcraft such as owls, bats, cockroaches and moths. Dogs barking at night are believed to have spotted a witch. Witches were believed to use bats and rats as messengers to discover where money was hidden. Witch trials were often common in Old Calabar. The earliest mention of a witch trial can be found in W.F. Daniell&#x27;s 1848 work titled &quot;On the Natives of Old Callebar, West Coast of Africa&quot;. A witch trial often occurs in situations where a person is ill and is unable to discover the source of his illness or a person dies and is suspected to have been killed by witchcraft. If a person believed the cause of his illness was the workings of witchcraft, he would cut his hair and send it to all the Efik towns stating that if he died, they should launch an inquiry regarding his death. A person accused of witchcraft usually demanded that he undergo a witch trial to prove his innocence. The suspect ate eight Calabar beans and drank a mixture of ground Calabar beans and water. If the suspect was a witch his mouth shook and mucus came from his nose. If he was innocent he lifted his right hand and then regurgitated. Should the poison continue to affect the suspect after his innocence had been established, an antidote was administered consisting of either male or female excrement, depending on the suspect&#x27;s sex, mixed with water which had been used to wash a female&#x27;s external genitalia. This mixture was taken as a drink. If the suspect is found to be guilty, however, no antidote is given and he is allowed to die. After his demise his corpse is thrown into the forest.

=== Myths of death and the Afterlife ===
The Efik originally believed in the power of reincarnation. The Efik believed that seven reincarnations were to occur before the final judgement by Abasi. If an infant had a mark on its body which was equally on the body of a previously deceased sibling, the infant was believed to be a reincarnation of the deceased sibling. Belief in reincarnations accounts for the assigning of personal names such as Nyong () which is given to a child whose siblings have died before they were born. The name may also be given to a child who resembles a deceased relative. According to Simmons, One Efik belief postulates the existence of several worlds each separated from the sky above and the earth below. A person who dies in one world becomes reborn in the world below... When an Individual has passed through the entire seven worlds in seven generations he travels on a path which connects world seven with world one. Before he commences another seven-world cycle he renders an account to God of his actions during his sojourn in each of the worlds.
The spot where the individual renders an account to God of his actions was known as Usan Emana (). Spirits about to reincarnate were believed to dwell in Effiatt (formerly known as Tom Shott&#x27;s island). The Efik also believed in the existence of a realm inhabited by the souls of the dead. According to Aye, &quot;It was believed that all the ghosts of persons who die in a year sail in a large canoe at midnight of every 31 December, singing and paddling to their new home in Ọnọsi thus: &quot;Ekpo ke ẹnyọño Ọnọsi-o uwaya&quot;! The ghosts are returning to Onosi-o uwaya.&quot; There was also a belief in a realm deep within the Land of the dead known as mkpọsọk which could be likened to the Greek Tartarus.
==External influence on Efik mythology==
Due to peregrinations of the Efik across the Cross river and their external trade with the Europeans, several foreign influences can be seen in the myths of the Efik. Oral tradition maintains that the earliest Europeans to interact and trade with the Efik were the Portuguese. Later Europeans entrants into the Cross River were the Dutch, British and French. Christianity also played a role in shaping Efik mythology. The earliest Christian missionaries arrived from Jamaica in April 1846.

<doc id="98510" wikidata="Q1247708" url="?curid=98510" title="In the Heat of the Night (TV series)">
<text>In the Heat of the Night is an American police procedural crime drama television series loosely based on 1965 novel of the same title and the 1967 film of the same name. The TV series starred Carroll O&#x27;Connor as police chief Bill Gillespie and Howard Rollins as police detective Virgil Tibbs. The series was broadcast on NBC from March 6, 1988 to May 19, 1992 before moving to CBS, where it aired from October 28, 1992 to May 16, 1995. Its executive producers were O&#x27;Connor, Fred Silverman and Juanita Bartlett. This series marked O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s return to a series for the first time since the &quot;All in the Family&quot; spinoff &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; ended in 1983.

==Premise==
The show is a sequel to the 1967 film, whose events are said to have occurred &quot;a few years ago&quot; despite the show being set in the 1980s-1990s contemporary to its broadcast. 

In the premiere episode, Philadelphia homicide detective and criminal profiler Virgil Tibbs (Rollins) has returned to his hometown of Sparta, Mississippi for his mother&#x27;s funeral. He is persuaded by Mayor James Findlay to remain in Sparta as Chief of Detectives under Bill Gillespie (O&#x27;Connor), the police chief with whom he fostered a relationship during a previous murder investigation in which he assisted. Mayor Findlay himself has an ulterior motive for hiring Tibbs: he wants to have some kind of record on civil rights to run for Congress and hiring Tibbs to integrate the all-white Sparta police department would not only help to overcome the local squad&#x27;s reputation of being racist and underskilled, but also benefits him. Although the team suffers friction over Tibbs&#x27; dissatisfaction with the department&#x27;s limited resources and racial attitudes and Gillespie is annoyed at the detective&#x27;s condescending suspicions about his hometown, the two men prove highly effective in enforcing the law. 

At the beginning of the seventh season, Tibbs takes a leave of absence, moving to Jackson, Mississippi to complete his law degree on a compressed schedule. When he returns to Sparta, he and his wife, Althea (Anne Marie Johnson), have separated and they later divorce. She moves back to Philadelphia with their twins to be near her parents. Through the hard work of Sparta Councilwoman Harriet DeLong (Denise Nicholas), Tibbs is able to retire, although two months shy of the qualifying period, and keep his city pension. He begins practicing law upon accepting a position in Ben Taylor&#x27;s law office. Rollins&#x27; final appearance on the series was February 2, 1994. 

Meanwhile, the Sparta city council dismisses Gillespie as chief of police, selecting Hampton Forbes (Carl Weathers) as his replacement and making him the town&#x27;s first African American to serve in that position. Gillespie finds a new post of equivalent authority as county sheriff. The two senior police officials find that they get along excellently, in both professional and personal spheres.

===Themes===
The show dealt with a variety of issues, including racism, police brutality, interracial relationships, hate crimes, drug trafficking, drug addiction, alcoholism, AIDS, misogyny, incest, child abuse, sexual harassment, euthanasia, anti-Semitism, political corruption, prostitution, domestic violence, mental disorders, dysfunctional families, suicide, capital punishment, poverty and drunk driving.

==Seasons overview==
===1988===
The first season was filmed in Hammond, Louisiana. Hammond was selected by James Lee Barrett to represent the small southern town of Sparta, Mississippi. The producers had difficulty finding usable filming locations, because other, more modern structures were close enough to be picked up in the images. Eight episodes were filmed—the two-hour pilot movie and six regular one-hour episodes. The series premiered on March 6, 1988, with the season finale airing on May 3. Many conflicts arose between Juanita Bartlett and Carroll O&#x27;Connor over the writing of the series. At first, Bartlett allowed O&#x27;Connor to consult on the series per his contract. After the pilot, however, she ordered scripts from her writers. O&#x27;Connor described these as &quot;recycled material from other crime shows&quot;. He was disappointed in the writing, feeling that the writers were taking big-city stories and imposing them on a small town. He believed that the key to this show&#x27;s success was to express its small-town locale and characters through the stories. Scripts would be given to him marked &quot;FINAL: NO REWRITES&quot;, but O&#x27;Connor often rewrote scripts anyway, angering the production staff members, who felt they were burning up fax machines with the changes. O&#x27;Connor described Bartlett as a very arrogant person. If the show was going to be renewed, then O&#x27;Connor was not interested and threatened to quit the show unless Bartlett was replaced as executive producer. The early episodes were gritty, raw and considered groundbreaking for that time. There was an emphasis on grisly murders or other crimes, rather than the lives of the New South-era characters, for which the series later became known.

===1988–1989===
Season two premiered on December 4, 1988 due to a writers&#x27; strike; the season introduced a new look and set of executive producers, Jeri Taylor and her husband David Moessinger, with on-location shooting moved from Hammond, Louisiana to Covington, Georgia, which remained as the primary filming location of the show for the duration of the series. The season premiere was aired as a two-hour TV movie originally entitled &quot;The Voodoo Murders&quot;, now known in syndication as &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;. The plot revolved around a copycat murder of one that Gillespie had investigated 20 years earlier. Also, the Sparta city council was pushing Virgil Tibbs to run as a possible candidate for Chief of Police to replace Gillespie, but Virgil wasn&#x27;t interested in doing so; regardless, a rumor begins that Tibbs is after Gillespie&#x27;s job, causing dissension between the two men. Virgil&#x27;s wife, Althea, who was a stay-at-home wife in the first season, is offered a position as a teacher and guidance counselor at local Sparta High School by city Councilman Ted Marcus (Thom Gossom Jr.). Gone was Christian LeBlanc, who portrayed Officer Junior Abernathy and added were two new regular characters-- Joanne St. John (Lois Nettleton), the chief&#x27;s sometime girlfriend and owner of the local diner, The Magnolia Cafe; and rookie officer Wilson Sweet (Geoffrey Thorne), fresh out of the police academy. The season also introduced the first of several new recurring characters, including county coroner Dr. Frank Robb (Dan Biggers). &quot;The Creek&quot; saw the introduction of the first new police character and the second prominent Georgia performer to claim a regular role on the series, Officer Randy Goode (1988-1993) played by Randall Franks, who was cast following the show&#x27;s move to Covington. &quot;Gunshot&quot;, where Virgil experiences guilt and mental trauma after he shoots and kills a female robbery suspect, introduces a character with a criminal past who later becomes invaluable in supplying Gillespie and the Sparta P.D. with information, Jimmy Dawes (Afemo Omilami). Plots in this season included Gillespie witnessing the execution of a man whom he arrested years ago, an episode that O&#x27;Connor wrote himself under the pseudonym Matt Harris (&quot;A Trip Upstate&quot;). During the filming of the episode &quot;Walkout&quot;, O&#x27;Connor began to experience fatigue. It was later discovered that he needed sextuple heart bypass surgery, due to years of heavy smoking. During the last four episodes of the season, Joe Don Baker was brought in as Tom Dugan, a replacement for Chief Gillespie, who was said to be away at a police training conference at Quantico. The episodes where Gillespie was away were &quot;Fifteen Forever&quot;, &quot;Ladybug, Ladybug&quot;, &quot;The Pig Woman of Sparta&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot;. Dugan was appointed acting chief by Councilwoman White, but he was actually working undercover for the FBI in an attempt to stop the assassination of a civil rights preacher during a visit to the town by a white supremacist group (that is not revealed until the season three episode &quot;Anniversary&quot;).

The season finale &quot;Missing&quot; has the chief being kidnapped upon his return to Sparta by two men in pig masks and the police and the FBI are trying to locate him and those responsible. O&#x27;Connor wanted the chief to undergo heart surgery in the storyline, but the Taylor and Moessinger came up with this storyline instead. It was the final straw in a long line of complaints against Taylor and Moessinger, who were fired at the end of the season, with O&#x27;Connor becoming sole executive producer the rest of the series. When Taylor and Moessinger decided to do the show, Taylor was quoted, &quot;I was one of those in the &#x27;60s that was out marching for civil rights&quot; and &quot;I was one of those who thought the major work had all been done. When we decided to do the show, we took research trips to the South and we saw that there had been an enormous amount of change. We came back with a renewed vigor but also with the realization that there is still a lot more to be done. There is still deeply entrenched racism. And addressing that became a much larger element in our thinking about the show.&quot; Moessinger was quoted, &quot;What makes race relations a constant in our show is the two lead characters-- one is white and one is black. Whether they are angry at each other, whether they&#x27;re happy or sad, we&#x27;re showing the interaction of two men who are trying to do the best in life. If we never put one race issue into it, if we never said one word about it, the message is there because it&#x27;s showing how people ought to interrelate, how they ought to work together, how they ought to get along.&quot;

===1989–1990===
In the third season, O&#x27;Connor took complete control of the show after firing Taylor and Moessinger. From that point on, he brought aboard writers and showrunners who shared his vision of where he wanted the series to go. Althea deals with the effects and aftermath of rape in the explosive season premiere episode titled &quot;Rape&quot;. Upon returning home from the grocery store one afternoon after school, Althea is ambushed and raped in her kitchen by Sparta High School&#x27;s new music teacher, Stephen Ainslee (Ken Marshall), who Althea had an uneasy relationship with from the beginning because he couldn&#x27;t handle her authority and it culminated in the attack. Althea and Virgil are frustrated trying to bring Stephen to justice because new district attorney Gerard Darnelle (Wilbur Fitzgerald) doesn&#x27;t have enough evidence to prosecute him, especially a positive ID (Ainslee blindfolded Althea with her scarf during the attack, so she couldn&#x27;t see his face, but she recognized his voice) and Stephen&#x27;s wife, Linda (Stacy Ray), provides him with an false alibi saying that he was at home with her at the time that Althea was attacked. After Chief Gillespie calls Linda out for her complicity, Linda finally comes forward and implicates Stephen, who invades the Tibbs home during this time and attempts to attack Althea again, but Althea successfully defends herself and Stephen is arrested. The second part of the season two finale, &quot;Missing&quot;, is resumed in &quot;Anniversary&quot;-- a decision made by O&#x27;Connor that displeased NBC because the episodes were not shown in chronological order. The season two cliffhanger depicted Gillespie being kidnapped and Dugan murdered; with the displacement of the episodes, it was as if none of that ever happened. O&#x27;Connor selected &quot;Rape&quot; to kick off season three instead because he thought it was more powerful and would attract higher ratings. The character of Joanne St. John was eliminated to make room for Sparta city Councilwoman Harriet DeLong as Chief Gillespie&#x27;s future love interest, first as a recurring character, then later as a main cast member. An attractive divorcée, Harriet was college-educated (an Alpha Kappa Alpha member), outspoken and brimming with attitude, which was a turn-off to Gillespie at first and the two of them did not get along. In &quot;First Girl&quot;, Gillespie hires Christine Rankin, Sparta&#x27;s first black policewoman, who is later killed her first day on duty in a shootout with a drug dealer and murder suspect, causing Gillespie despair and guilt. As a result, he is temporarily suspended from his duties as chief of police pending an investigation and intent on seeking out Rankin&#x27;s killer. Her replacement was Officer LuAnn Corbin (Crystal R. Fox), who would remain a prominent character throughout the rest of the series, although Fox was listed in the ending credits as a guest star until season seven where she finally appeared in the opening credits. Hiring LuAnn opens the door for more policewomen to join the force; Officer Dee Shepard (Dee Shaw) is hired later in the season. In the two-part season finale, &quot;Citizen Trundel&quot; (written by O&#x27;Connor, Cynthia Deming and William J. Royce), 

Harriet&#x27;s sister, Natalie, is murdered by order of her secret lover and the married father of her nine-year-old son, millionaire businessman V.J. &quot;Vidge&quot; Trundel. The situation causes Harriet anguish, rage and frustration, not only because of Natalie&#x27;s murder but because Chief Gillespie is reluctant to pursue the powerful Trundel as a suspect. These are the first episodes in which we see Bill and Harriet&#x27;s relationship blossom. During this period, he is able to see beyond her hardened exterior and finds a vulnerable and sensitive woman behind it; she discovers his compassionate side. From this point on, a camaraderie is formed between the two. This story arc was of special significance to Nicholas, as her real-life sister had been murdered ten years earlier and the culprit had never been caught. When O&#x27;Connor approached Nicholas about the storyline, it had upset her greatly and she had to write him a note explaining the situation, as he was unaware of the circumstances. He offered to have her not appear in the episode, but she chose to do so to bring closure for her and her family. She was able to channel her unresolved grief into the role. Only O&#x27;Connor and director Leo Penn knew the truth during filming.

====Rollins&#x27; substance abuse problems====
During the back half of season three, Rollins took six weeks off when he entered a drug and alcohol rehab program to battle his addiction issues. He missed five episodes: &quot;King&#x27;s Ransom&quot;, &quot;Triangle&quot;, &quot;Hello In There&quot;, &quot;December Days&quot; and &quot;An Angry Woman&quot;. MGM worked around his rehab schedule. Episodes were not necessarily aired in the order they were filmed, which explains why Tibbs was present one week and not the next. In an attempt to explain Rollins&#x27; absence, Tibbs was said to be in New Orleans working for the FBI. He considered suicide shortly before Christmas 1989, prompting his stay in rehab. O&#x27;Connor threatened to sue a tabloid which published a story saying that MGM and O&#x27;Connor had fired Rollins for being absent from the set due to his problems. Nicholas said &quot;Carroll set the standard for loyalty. If he liked you, he really liked you and would be there for you.&quot;

===1990–1991===
Cynthia Deming and William J. Royce were made main story editors. The season opens with a two-hour movie entitled &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; and the birth of Virgil and Althea&#x27;s twins, William and Sarah. While Althea is waiting to go into labor, Tibbs&#x27; friend and ex-colleague from the Philadelphia P.D. is found dead and it&#x27;s at first labeled as a suicide. Tibbs heads up to the big city to attend his funeral, only to learn his friend&#x27;s death was not by his own hand, but murder. Tibbs soon recognizes there is corruption going on within the police department and his friend was framed for the murder of a drug dealer. In the process of trying to clear his friend&#x27;s name, he first becomes a target, then framed for murder himself. Chief Gillespie travels to Philly to get Virgil out of jail, help him solve the mystery of what happened to his friend and seek justice for him, expose the corrupt officers and make it back home to Sparta in time for the twins&#x27; birth. William and Sarah Tibbs were welcomed into the world on September 18, 1990. Other stories include Bubba going to Los Angeles to extradite a Sparta resident responsible for a fire that killed two people, which was actually the first of two backdoor pilots for a series that featured Alan Autry, but neither were picked up by the network.

===1991–1992===
The fifth season begins with the revelation that Chief Gillespie has a 19-year-old daughter, Lana Farren (Christine Elise, formerly of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;). The chief is now good friends with her mother, Georgia (Stella Stevens). Lana was conceived during a period where her mother was separated from her husband and she and Gillespie had an affair. However, she was never divorced from her husband Ken. In the episode &quot;The More Things Change&quot;, Gillespie and DeLong share their first kiss after he drives her home after attending a party and he finally reveals his affections for her. They both lament the very likely possibility that a relationship between the two of them would not be accepted by most in Sparta. Other storylines include Sweet&#x27;s quest to discover the truth about the murder of his grandfather in 1948 and those responsible for it (a story loosely based on the murder of Medgar Evers, &quot;Sweet, Sweet Blues&quot;) and racists sabotaging a celebration honoring a Sparta civil rights pioneer in &quot;Odessa&quot;, the first of six episodes written by Nicholas, who, despite enjoying her role as Harriet, was bothered by the show&#x27;s lack of black writers and complained about it to O&#x27;Connor, who admitted that she was right. He asked Nicholas to write a script, which she did. When she submitted it, O&#x27;Connor liked it so much that he encouraged her to write others for the series.

In the two-part season finale &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;The Law on Trial&quot;, Sheriff McComb has Gillespie and Tibbs charged with obstruction and harboring a fugitive after an escaped prisoner-- a Salvadoran immigrant seeking asylum-- is given sanctuary in a monastery and the two don&#x27;t arrest him when he refuses to give himself up. The prisoner is later shot and killed in a standoff with the sheriff&#x27;s department. Father DiMarco&#x27;s heartfelt summation to the jury contributes to the case being dismissed (though that is not revealed until the start of season six). Between court appearances, Harriet pays Gillespie an inconspicuous visit and the two share a tender and romantic moment. The conflict between Sheriff McComb and Chief Gillespie lingers throughout the following season, affecting every crossover dealing with subsequent interactions between McComb&#x27;s deputies and Gillespie&#x27;s officers. It isn&#x27;t until the arrival of Chief Hampton Forbes (Weathers) in season seven that we see Sheriff McComb and Chief Gillespie as friends again. The episode and the season end with Gillespie and Tibbs awaiting the verdict in their respective residences on the evening the case is given to the jury. At the end of the original and final broadcast on NBC, it was revealed that the jury couldn&#x27;t reach a verdict, a mistrial is declared and the two men are freed. Bill and Harriet spend the night together for the first time.

===1992–1993===
At the beginning of season six, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; moved from NBC to CBS. It was not publicly known at the time when season five ended whether or not the show would continue. NBC ultimately decided not to renew the series, although the ratings were still respectable and there were still some open-ended plots that hadn&#x27;t been resolved. A deal was made with CBS to keep the show on the air. Originally, CBS opted to pick up the series for only a set of six two-hour movies. However, it was eventually picked up for a full 22-episode order. The first two episodes of the season see the secret romance between Gillespie and DeLong intensify. They frequently meet in a studio apartment that doubles as Harriet&#x27;s art studio. In the midst of all this, Harriet&#x27;s son, Eugene, is a witness to a drive-by shooting involving rival drug gangs. Other highlights from the season include a faded country music singer (Robert Goulet) who ends up committing murder; the reconciliation between Gillespie and his estranged daughter Lana; and a two-part episode directed by Larry Hagman involves a white supremacist politician whose visit to Sparta has a couple of ulterior motives, including aspirations for a presidential run (&quot;The Leftover Man&quot;). Burgess Meredith (in one of his last acting roles) also appears as an eccentric judge overseeing a case (he would return for a brief cameo in season seven). The season ends with Bill and Harriet forced to confront the impending execution of Harriet&#x27;s ex-husband Vic (who was part of a robbery in Season Four where someone was killed and Vic was tried and convicted of first degree murder) and Eugene&#x27;s disapproval of their relationship.

====Howard Rollins&#x27; firing====
Rollins was ultimately dropped from the show for health reasons plus three outstanding warrants in Rockdale County and the city of Covington. He was replaced for season seven by Weathers. Filming began on April 28, 1993. Rollins had not been seen on the set since January 1993, when season six wrapped. Despite numerous attempts by the media to contact Rollins, who was believed to be living in New York City, only O&#x27;Connor was in contact with Rollins during this period with the hope that Rollins would get his legal and personal issues resolved and return to the series, but unfortunately, that was not the case. After season 6, Johnson, Thorne and Rollins left the series. Rollins would return occasionally as a guest star, while Johnson took a starring role on the final season of Fox&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot; and Thorne left to pursue a career as a novelist and screenwriter; the character of Sweet simply vanished from the series without any explanation.

===Seventh season, 1993–1994===
Season 7 opens with Bill Gillespie being forced out of office and former Memphis, Tennessee Police Department Inspector Hampton Forbes (Carl Weathers) is hired as the new police chief by the city council. After nearly three decades on the Sparta police force, Gillespie does not receive a new contract from the council because his romance with Harriet is now out in the open, although other excuses are made for his dismissal. He seems to be accepting of the outcome, while Harriet doesn&#x27;t hesitate to show her fury over the decision. The transition from Gillespie being in charge to Forbes taking over is slightly uneasy at the very start, but soon things smooth out.

However, Gillespie is soon appointed as the acting Sheriff of Newton County when Nathan McComb suffers a heart attack and is too ill to continue his duties. This new appointment for Gillespie angers several on the city council. They want an investigation, which is upsetting and hurtful for Harriet.

Other cases involve a nine-year-old girl being killed because of a drunk driver (Hagman directed), the return of Parker&#x27;s stepfather, Roy Eversole (Pat Hingle, first seen in Season 6) and his lady friend Miss Roda (Anne Meara). Gillespie must once again confront his racist past when a new synagogue moves into Sparta and the rabbi (Jerry Stiller) detests Gillespie, who in the 1960s was serving as an officer on the Sparta Police, for his failure to oppose the then serving anti-Semitic Sparta police chief, and who refused to investigate the burning of the local synagogue back in the 1960s. Christine Elise makes one final appearance as Bill&#x27;s daughter in the episode &quot;A Love Lost&quot;, directed by Larry Hagman, in which Gillespie must protect her from a former boyfriend involved in a gun-running scheme in Sparta.

Virgil Tibbs returns from Jackson with his juris doctor — which explains his absence – in his new capacity as attorney in three episodes (&quot;Virgil Tibbs: Attorney At Law&quot;, &quot;Good Cop, Bad Cop&quot;, &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot;) and assists the Sparta P.D. with several cases after having moved into Ben Taylor&#x27;s law office. Virgil reveals to Gillespie in &quot;Virgil Tibbs: Attorney At Law&quot; that Althea has left him and took their twins back home to Philadelphia to live, fed up with her life in Sparta and traumatized from all that had happened to her while living there. She didn&#x27;t want to make the marriage work and later files for divorce, which a heartbroken Virgil does not contest, although he has difficulty accepting his new status as a divorced man. The episode &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot;, where Virgil suspects that one of his law firm&#x27;s clients orchestrated an &quot;accident&quot; which resulted in his spouse&#x27;s death, marks Howard Rollins&#x27; final appearance on the show (air date February 2, 1994).

In the episode &quot;Ches and the Grand Lady&quot;, Bobby Short reprises his role as Ches Collins, the blues musician from &quot;Sweet, Sweet Blues&quot; in Season 5. The episode also guest stars Jean Simmons as a dying grand dame of Sparta who is Ches&#x27;s old flame and the overbearing great-aunt of Lonnie Jamison. Harriet&#x27;s son Eugene once again finds himself at odds with the police, endangering his parole trying to help a friend. Maybelle Chesboro (played by Elizabeth Ashley), the ex-madam, returns. (The role of Maybelle was initially played by Diane Ladd in Season 3&#x27;s &quot;Home Is Where the Heart Is&quot;.) She has returned to operate a legal phone sex business.

Finally, in &quot;Dangerous Engagement&quot;, Gillespie and DeLong tie the knot at the same sanctuary involved in the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; case from Season 5. Chief Forbes serves as best man.

The season and the TV series wraps up with a two-hour movie of the week, &quot;Give Me Your Life&quot;, starring Peter Fonda as Marcantony Appfel, leader of a religious cult in which the sexual abuse of children is rumored to have occurred. The story (by O&#x27;Connor and written by Cynthia Deming and William J. Royce) is loosely based on the real-life drama in Waco, Texas, in 1993 with the cult leader David Koresh and his followers.

===TV movies and Hugh O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death===
Four made-for-television movies were produced during the 1994–95 season, continuing the series. Once released on DVD, these movies were considered the eighth season of the show. The movies were:
* &quot;A Matter of Justice&quot;
* &quot;Who Was Geli Bendl?&quot; (directed by Larry Hagman)
* &quot;By Duty Bound&quot;
* &quot;Grow Old Along with Me&quot;

Carroll&#x27;s son and series cast member Hugh O&#x27;Connor died by suicide nearly two months before the fourth film aired, having been struggling with a substance abuse issues since his teen years. When the film was broadcast in its original, two-hour format, a black screen was added in between the intro tag and the opening title; it read &quot;In memory of Hugh O&#x27;Connor: 1962–1995&quot;.

==Broadcast history==
The series debuted as a midseason replacement for the NBC series &quot;J.J. Starbuck,&quot; premiering on March 6, 1988. The series ran on the network until May 19, 1992, when it moved to CBS and aired until May 16, 1995.

==Locations==
Like the original movie, the television series also took place in a fictionalized version of Sparta, Mississippi. While there is a real Sparta located in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, the version of Sparta shown on television is very different from the real town. For example, the TV Sparta is situated along Interstate 20 in Newton County, while the real town is nowhere near any interstate. During the first season, Hammond, Louisiana was the site of the show&#x27;s production. In the second season, the show was moved to Georgia, to an area east of Atlanta and it remained there for the rest of its run. The principal area of Sparta was in fact downtown Covington, Georgia. Rural scenes were filmed in a wide surrounding area, in the Georgia counties of Newton (where Covington is located), Rockdale, Walton, Morgan, and Jasper. Decatur in Dekalb County was used as a stand-in for an episode as the Mississippi Capital city of Jackson, and Atlanta itself was used in one episode, in which Bubba worked on a case there. In fact, during the series&#x27; run, many of the cast members had homes in the area and were often spotted in local restaurants and retail stores. The cast members would also go around to local schools to speak to students.

===Broadcast and syndication===
The series also airs in broadcast syndication on Ovation. Ovation airs the show every Monday and Tuesday afternoon for five hours from 2:00 PM ET to 7:00 PM ET back to back. WGN America previously aired the series every weekday morning starting at 11AM ET for 4 hours usually until 3PM ET Monday through Thursday. WGN aired the show Fridays, too, at the same time. Ovation now has moved the show to Monday mornings from 8 AM to 2 PM as part of their &quot;Morning Mysteries&quot; crime and mystery drama block, and Thursdays at 10 PM/9 PM ET/CT (or sometimes 11 PM/10 PM ET/CT.). The show also aired Tuesdays nights at 7PM ET, but was scaled down to just a Thursday airing starting December 7, 2020. MeTV also acquired the rights to the show and it began airing in around either 2018 or 2019, running it every weekday beginning at 11AM ET/10AM CT. MGM&#x27;s ThisTV network, a classic movie-focused network, also airs the show weekdays. The show previously aired on TNT from 1995 to 2005. The show has remained relatively strong in syndication to this day, particularly airing on some local stations. Bounce TV began airing reruns of the series starting September 13, 2021.

==Awards==
Both Carroll O&#x27;Connor and Howard Rollins received prestigious awards for their work on the show in 1989. O&#x27;Connor received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, and Rollins the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series, his second.

&quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Drama Series (formally Outstanding Drama Series, Mini-Series or Television Movie), two years in a row, 1992 and 1993. The 1992 win was specifically for the Season 5 episode, &quot;Sweet, Sweet Blues&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The theme song, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, was originally recorded by Quincy Jones, with Ray Charles on vocals and piano for the movie. It is usually paired with &quot;They Call Me Mr. Tibbs&quot; on albums. Bill Champlin of the band Chicago sang the opening theme song for the television series.

The original song itself is supposed to be from Virgil&#x27;s point of view, being a stranger in a hostile environment. In the case of the TV series, the lyrics refer to both main characters fighting crime in the tiny town of Sparta.

Randall Franks and Alan Autry co-produced the cast CD &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin&quot;&#x27; for Sonlite and MGM/UA, featuring the entire cast and a host of music stars. It was released Christmas 1991 and 1992, and was among the top holiday recordings of those years around the South and Midwest.

<doc id="98511" wikidata="Q5278361" url="?curid=98511" title="Dinka religion">
<text>Dinka spirituality is the traditional religion of the Dinka people (also known as Muonyjang), an ethnic group of South Sudan. They belong to the Nilotic peoples, which is a group of cultures in Southern Sudan and wider Eastern Africa. The Dinka people largely rejected or ignored Islamic and Christian teachings, as Abrahamic religious beliefs were incompatible with their society, culture and traditional beliefs.

== Creation of humans and life ==
The supreme, creator god, Nhialic (pronounced as Nhialich), is the god of the sky and rain, and the ruler of all the other gods and spirits. He is generally seen as distant from humans. Nhialic is also known as Jaak, Juong or Dyokin by other Nilotic groups such as the Nuer and Shilluk. Nhialic created ex-nihilo and rarely involves itself with the affairs of humans.

There are several versions of the Dinka creation myth which mainly concerns itself with the creation of humans. The first humans are Garang and Abuk. In some cases Nhialic created humans by blowing them out of its nose, other accounts say humans originated from the sky and were placed in the river where they came as fully formed adults. Other accounts say that humans were molded as clay figures and placed to mature in pots. Garang and Abuk were made out of the clay of Sudan.

Nhialic told them to multiply and that their children would die but would come back to life within 15 days. Garang protested that if nobody dies permanently then there would not be enough food. Nhialic then introduced permanent death. Nhialic commanded them to only plant one seed of grain a day or gave them one grain to eat a day. Being hungry, everyday Abuk made a paste with the grain to make the food last longer. However, when Abuk disobeyed and planted more Nhialic cut the rope that connected Heaven and Earth.

==Pantheon==
The Dinka have a pantheon of deities, most notable:

* Nhialic, a supreme god
* Du Chie, a creation god, sometimes precursor, other co-creator with Nhialic
* Ayum, goddess of the wind. She is often referred to as a force that prevents rain from falling.
* Alwet, goddess of the rain.
* Aja.
* Nyanngol, also known as Nyanwol or Nyancar, a female goddess.
* Gerrang, also known as Garang. Johnston (1934) described him as a malicious god who often leads humans to commit sins, while Lienhardt (1961) portrays him as a healer deity, though Lienhardt also confirms that the Dinka people tend to attribute misfortunes to Gerrang.
* Ayak, counterpart to Ayum, a female goddess.
* Abum
* Abuk Dit, a mother goddess
* Dengdit or Deng, is the sky god of rain and fertility. Deng&#x27;s mother is Abuk, the patron goddess of gardening and all women, represented by a snake.

The term &quot;Jok&quot; refers to a group of ancestral spirits and patron deities of tribes.

== Invocation of prayers ==
The Dinka address their prayers first to the Supreme Being Nhialic then invoke other deities.

The Dinka offer prayers for receiving mild weather. They also pray for good harvest, protection of people, cattle recovery from illness, and good hunting.

Sacrifices of a bull or ox are offered to Nhialic. The Dinka perform sacrifices along with prayers. The invokes all clan-divinities, free-divinities and ancestral spirits and at times Nhialic. Those who are saying the prayers hold a fishing spear in their hands. Short phrases expressing the need are chanted while the spear is thrust at the animal to be sacrificed. The participants repeat the words of the leader. At times of crisis or an important occasion the Dinka will continue to pray and sacrifice for long periods of time.

Stages of sacrificial prayer.

1. The Leader describes the issue the people are facing.

2. The Leader and all present Acknowledge past sins.

3. Praise is offered singing hymns of honor or ox-songs.

4. Expulsion of the misfortune to the sacrificial animal.

== Animism ==

The Dinka are also animists. They have a Pastoral lifestyle. The Dinka inherit a totem from both their parents. The faithful are expected to make offerings to their totem force and maintain positive relations with members. Eating or hurting your totem animal is a bad omen for those who share a totem. Some totems are believed to endow powers. The owl totem, for example, is believed to give the power of providence. Totems are not exclusively animals, although most are; some Dinka having as their totem a metallic ore or element.

In the Dinka language, a totem is known as a &quot;kuar&quot;. Dinka do not worship their totems but rather speak of being &quot;related&quot; to them.

=== Snakes ===
Some Dinka people respect African puff adders. The most commonly respected snakes are Atemyath, Biar keroor, and Maluang. These snakes are given offerings of locally-made melted cheese to appease them, after which they are released into the forest. Killing snakes is believed to be a bad omen for the community or the individual, with the assumption that spirits may strike the killer.
==Astrology==
As in other cultures, the Dinka practice a form of astrology:

<text>Founded in 1948 as Jungle Aviation and Radio Service by William Cameron Townsend, JAARS is a worldwide, non-profit, mission aviation and support organization with a primary focus on Bible translation support operations. JAARS provides practical support in aviation, land and maritime transportation, information technology and media. Its current president is Steve Russell, as of October 1, 2022.

JAARS marks its 75th anniversary in 2023, with a slight adjustment to its name to incorporate its 75-year heritage—Jungle Aviation and Relay Service.

JAARS is a wholly controlled subsidiary of SIL International, but also partners with many other organizations.

== History ==
William Cameron Townsend co-founded Wycliffe Bible Translators and SIL International in 1934, and as the organization grew, he saw the need for airplanes and radio to reach remote areas around the world and to provide safe access to language groups. JAARS was originally formed as Jungle Aviation and Radio Service in Peru in 1948 and moved to its current location in Waxhaw, North Carolina, in 1961. The 572 acres of land where JAARS is located began as a 200-acre donation by the Belk family. In 1986, as a result of diversifying activities (like information technology and purchasing and shipping), JAARS officially dropped the original meaning behind the acronym and became simply &quot;JAARS Inc.&quot; 

==Operations and activities==

===JAARS Base===
JAARS&#x27; North Carolina headquarters is commonly called the &quot;JAARS Base&quot;. The base is operated by over 500 people on 551 acres, encompassing 68 buildings. While the JAARS Base serves as the home for all the organization&#x27;s core operations (like transportation), it also hosts staff from partner organizations. For example, SIL International has IT and media staff working at the JAARS Base, and Wycliffe Bible Translators USA has a large contingent of human resources personnel with offices at the center. The center&#x27;s airport is registered with the FAA as JAARS-Townsend Airport , a public-use airport. The public-use runway is 3,309&#x27; x 40&#x27; listed as good asphalt. Additionally, three grass runways are used by JAARS for standards training.
===Aviation===
In aviation, JAARS helps its field partners start and run local aviation programs. This help comes from training staff, setting standards, equipping aircraft, research, and more.

These associates in turn offer several transportation services to a range of individuals, including translators, support staff, consultants, trainers, linguists, Christian mission organizations, hospitals, locals, and governments. These services can also include medical evacuations and disaster relief work.

JAARS&#x27; aviation partners fly a variety of aircraft, including:
* Bell Long Ranger helicopter, flown by SIL International in Papua New Guinea
* Robinson R66 helicopter, flown at the JAARS Center and by SIL International in Cameroon
* Cessna 206, flown at the JAARS Center and by partners in Brazil, Cameroon, and Papua New Guinea
* Cessna 207, Soloy Turbine conversion, flown by SIL International in Cameroon
* Cessna 208 Caravan, flown by YAJASI in Indonesia
* Helio Courier, flown at the JAARS Center
* Pilatus PC-12, flown by YAJASI in Indonesia
* Pilatus PC-6, flown at the JAARS Center and by YAJASI in Indonesia
* Quest Kodiak, flown by SIL International in Papua New Guinea

JAARS was one of fifteen organizations that financed the prototyping and development of the Quest Kodiak. JAARS also developed S-Seats, a seat for Bushliner 1850 that enhanced the crashworthiness and adaptability of the aircraft. JAARS also transported tons of supplies in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. 

==Museum==

The Alphabet Museum is located at the JAARS Base in Waxhaw, North Carolina. The museum was established in 1991 by JAARS founder William Cameron Townsend and focuses on the development of the world&#x27;s alphabets and the history of writing systems and written languages. Exhibits include maps, paintings, sculptures, a replica of the Rosetta Stone, a Torah scroll that is over 150 years old and a handmade lyre. The languages covered include Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic and African languages.

The newly reopened Cardenas Building (named for former Mexican president Lázaro Cárdenas) features all new exhibits that tell the story of JAARS.

<text>Carl Lee Perkins (April 9, 1932 – January 19, 1998) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. A rockabilly great and pioneer of rock and roll, he began his recording career at the Sun Studio, in Memphis in 1954. Among his best known songs are &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Matchbox&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot;.

According to fellow musician Charlie Daniels, &quot;Carl Perkins&#x27; songs personified the rockabilly era, and Carl Perkins&#x27; sound personifies the rockabilly sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed.&quot; Perkins&#x27;s songs were recorded by artists (and friends) as influential as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, Ricky Nelson, and Eric Clapton which further cemented his prominent place in the history of popular music.

Nicknamed the &quot;King of Rockabilly&quot;, Perkins was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. His recording of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Carl Lee Perkins was born on April 9, 1932, in Tiptonville, Tennessee, the son of poor sharecroppers Louise and Buck Perkins (misspelled on his birth certificate as &quot;Perkings&quot;). He had two brothers, Jay and Clayton. From the age of six, he worked long hours in the cotton fields with his family whether school was in session or not. The boys grew up hearing Southern gospel music sung by white friends in church and by black field workers and sharecroppers in the cotton fields. On Saturday nights Perkins would listen to the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, broadcast from Nashville on his father&#x27;s radio.

Roy Acuff&#x27;s broadcasts from the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar. Since they could not afford to buy one, his father made one from a cigar box and a broomstick. Eventually, a neighbor sold his father a worn-out Gene Autry guitar. Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke, he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of blue note.

Perkins taught himself parts of Acuff&#x27;s Great Speckled Bird and The Wabash Cannonball having heard them played on the &quot;Opry&quot;. He also has cited Bill Monroe&#x27;s fast playing and vocals as an early influence. Perkins also learned from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties who played blues and gospel music on an old acoustic guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to &quot;Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate.&quot;

In January 1947, the Perkins family moved from Lake County, Tennessee, to Madison County, 70 miles from Memphis, the largest city in West Tennessee and a center of a great variety of music played by both black and white artists. At age fourteen, Perkins wrote a country song called Let Me Take You to the Movie, Magg. Sam Phillips was later persuaded by the quality of that song to sign Perkins to his Sun Records label.

===Beginnings as a performer===
Perkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers during late 1946 at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, Tennessee, starting on Wednesday nights. Perkins was 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an up-tempo country blues shuffle version of Bill Monroe&#x27;s Blue Moon of Kentucky. Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Perkins drank four beers that first night. Within a month, Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern near Jackson&#x27;s western border. Both places were the scene of occasional fights and both of the Perkins brothers gained a reputation as fighters.

During the next couple of years, as they became better known, the Perkins brothers began playing other taverns around Bemis and Jackson, including El Rancho, the Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop. Carl persuaded his brother Clayton to join them and play the upright bass, to complete the sound of the band.

Perkins began performing regularly on WTJS in Jackson during the late 1940s as a sometime member of the Tennessee Ramblers. He appeared on the radio program &quot;Hayloft Frolic&quot; on which he performed two songs. Sometimes, one was Talking Blues as done by Robert Lunn on the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. Perkins and his brothers began appearing on &quot;The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour&quot;. Positive listener response earned them a 15-minute segment sponsored by Mother&#x27;s Best Flour. By the end of the 1940s, the Perkins Brothers were the best known band in the Jackson area. Perkins had day jobs during most of these early years including picking cotton, working at various factories and plants and as a pan greaser for the Colonial Baking Company. His brothers had similar pick up jobs.

In January 1953, Perkins married Valda Crider, whom he had known for a number of years. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part-time, Valda, who had her own job, encouraged Perkins to begin working the taverns full-time. He began playing six nights a week. Later the same year, he added W.S. &quot;Fluke&quot; Holland to the band as a drummer. Holland had no previous experience as a musician but had a good sense of rhythm.

Malcolm Yelvington, who remembered the Perkins Brothers when they played in Covington, Tennessee in 1953, noted that Carl had an unusual blues-like style all his own. By 1955, Perkins had made tapes of his material on a borrowed tape recorder and sent them to record companies such as Columbia and RCA. But he used addresses such as Columbia Records, New York City and seemed dismayed at the lack of response. &quot;I had sent tapes to RCA and Columbia and had never heard a thing from &#x27;em.&quot;

In July 1954, Perkins and his wife heard a new release of &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; by Elvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black on the radio. As the song faded out, Perkins said, &quot;There&#x27;s a man in Memphis who understands what we&#x27;re doing. I need to go see him.&quot; According to another telling of the story, it was Valda who said that he should go to Memphis. Later, Presley told Perkins he had traveled to Jackson and had seen Perkins and his group playing at the El Rancho.

Years later, the rockabilly singer Gene Vincent told an interviewer that, rather than Elvis&#x27;s version of &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; being a &quot;new sound&quot;, &quot;a lot of people were doing it before that, especially Carl Perkins.&quot;

=== Sun Records ===

Perkins successfully auditioned for Sam Phillips at Sun Records in early October 1954. &quot;Movie Magg&quot; and &quot;Turn Around&quot; were released on the Phillips-owned Flip label (151) on March 19, 1955. &quot;Turn Around&quot; became a regional success, and Perkins was booked to appear along with Elvis Presley at theaters in Marianna and West Memphis, Arkansas. Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two were the next Sun musicians to be added to the shows. During the summer of 1955 they had junkets to Little Rock and Forrest City, Arkansas, and to Corinth and Tupelo, Mississippi. Again performing at El Rancho, the Perkins brothers were involved in an automobile accident in Woodside, Delaware. A friend who was driving was pinned by the steering wheel. Perkins dragged him from the burning car. Clayton was thrown from the car but was not seriously injured.

Sun released another Perkins song, &quot;Gone Gone Gone&quot;, in October 1955, which also became a regional success. It was a &quot;bounce blues in flavorsome combined country and R&amp;B idioms&quot;. The A-side was the more traditional country song &quot;Let the Jukebox Keep On Playing&quot;.

Commenting on Perkins&#x27;s playing, Sam Phillips has been quoted as saying

&quot;I knew that Carl could rock and in fact he told me right from the start that he had been playing that music before Elvis came out on record ... I wanted to see whether this was someone who could revolutionize the country end of the business.&quot;

Also in the autumn of 1955, Perkins wrote &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; inspired by seeing a dancer get angry with his date for scuffing up his shoes. Several weeks later, on December 19, 1955, Perkins and his band recorded the song during a session at Sun Studio in Memphis. Phillips suggested changes to the lyrics (&quot;Go, cat, go&quot;), and the band changed the end of the song to a &quot;boogie vamp&quot;.

After Sun records headliner Presley left for RCA in November 1955, Phillips told Perkins, &quot;You&#x27;re my rockabilly cat now.&quot; Sun released &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; on January 1, 1956 and it became a massive chart success. In the United States, it reached number one on Billboard magazine&#x27;s country music chart (the only number one success he would have) and number two on the Billboard Best Sellers popular music chart. On February 11, Presley performed it on CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Stage Show&quot;. On March 17, Perkins became the first country artist to reach number three on the rhythm and blues charts. That night, he performed the song on ABC-TV&#x27;s Ozark Jubilee and Presley reprised his performance on Stage Show.

In the United Kingdom, Perkins&#x27;s song reached number 10 on the British charts. It was the first record by a Sun artist to sell a million copies. The Beatles covered the B side, Honey Don&#x27;t, Wanda Jackson and in the 1970s, T. Rex. John Lennon originally sang the song when the Beatles performed it. Later it was given to Ringo Starr, one of his few leads during his time with the band. Lennon also performed the song on the &quot;Lost Lennon Tapes&quot;.

===Road crash===
After playing a show in Norfolk, Virginia, on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed to New York City for a March 24 appearance on NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Perry Como Show&quot;. Shortly before sunrise on March 22, on Route 13 between Dover and Woodside, Delaware, their vehicle hit the back of a pickup truck and went into a ditch containing about 12 inches of water. Holland had to pull Perkins, unconscious, from the water. Perkins had sustained three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body. Perkins remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver of the pickup truck, Thomas Phillips, a 40-year-old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel. Jay Perkins had a fractured neck and severe internal injuries. Later he developed a malignant brain tumor, and died in 1958.

On March 23, Presley&#x27;s band members Bill Black, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana visited Perkins on their way to New York to appear with Presley. Fontana recalled Perkins saying, &quot;You looked like a bunch of angels coming to see me.&quot; Black told him, &quot;Hey man, Elvis sends his love&quot;, and lit a cigarette for him, even though the patient in the next bed was in an oxygen tent. Presley also telegraphed Perkins his well wishes.

&quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; had sold more than 500,000 copies by March 22, and Sam Philips had planned to celebrate by presenting Perkins with a gold record on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;. While Perkins recuperated from his injuries, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; reached number one on regional pop, R&amp;B, and country charts. It also reached number two on the Billboard pop and country charts, below Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. By mid-April, more than one million copies of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; had sold. On April 3, while still recuperating in Jackson, Perkins watched Presley perform &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; in his first appearance on &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;. This was the third time he performed the song on national television.

===Return to recording and touring===

Perkins returned to live performances on April 21, 1956 beginning with an appearance in Beaumont, Texas, with the Big D Jamboree tour. Before he resumed touring, Sam Phillips arranged a recording session at Sun with Ed Cisco filling in for the still-recuperating Jay. By mid-April, they recorded Dixie Fried, Put Your Cat Clothes On, Wrong Yo-Yo, You Can&#x27;t Make Love to Somebody, Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby, and That Don&#x27;t Move Me. On May 26, Perkins and his band (with Jay Perkins performing wearing a visible neck brace), finally appeared on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; to perform &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;.

Beginning early that summer, Perkins was paid $1,000 to play two songs a night on the extended tour of Top Stars of &#x27;56. Other performers on the tour were Chuck Berry and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. When Perkins and the group entered the stage in Columbia, South Carolina, he was shocked to see a teenager with a bleeding chin pressed against the stage by the massed crowd. During the first guitar intermission of Honey Don&#x27;t, they were waved offstage and into a vacant dressing room behind a double line of police officers. Appalled by what he had seen and felt, Perkins left the tour. Appearing with Gene Vincent and Lillian Briggs in a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll show, he helped attract 39,872 people to the Reading Fair in Pennsylvania on a Tuesday night in late September. Soon after, a full grandstand and one thousand people stood in a heavy rain to hear Perkins and Briggs at the Brockton Fair in Massachusetts.

Sun issued more Perkins songs in 1956: Boppin&#x27; the Blues / All Mama&#x27;s Children (Sun 243), the B side co-written with Johnny Cash; and Dixie Fried / I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;m Not Sorry (Sun 249). Matchbox / Your True Love (Sun 261) came out in February, 1957. Boppin&#x27; the Blues reached number 47 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; pop singles chart, number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country and western chart, and number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart.

Matchbox became a rockabilly classic. It was recorded with Perkins on lead guitar and vocals, and then Sun studio piano player, Jerry Lee Lewis. Later that day, there was an impromptu session with Perkins, Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis informally referred to as the Million Dollar Quartet. Sun released the full recordings from this jam session, a selection of gospel, country, and R&amp;B songs in 1990.

On February 2, 1957, Perkins again appeared on &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;, singing Matchbox and Blue Suede Shoes. He also made at least two appearances on &quot;Town Hall Party&quot; in Compton, California, in 1957, singing both songs. Those performances were included in the &quot;Western Ranch Dance Party&quot; series filmed and distributed by Screen Gems.

He released That&#x27;s Right, co-written with Johnny Cash, backed with the ballad Forever Yours, as Sun single 274 in August, 1957. Neither side made it onto the charts.

The 1957 film &quot;Jamboree&quot; included Perkins performing Glad All Over. The song was written by Aaron Schroeder, Sid Tepper, and Roy C. Bennett, Sun released it in January, 1958.

===Life after Sun===
In 1958, Perkins moved to Columbia Records for which he recorded &quot;Jive After Five&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Record Hop&quot;, &quot;Levi Jacket (And a Long Tail Shirt)&quot;, &quot;Pop, Let Me Have the Car&quot;, &quot;Pink Pedal Pushers&quot;, &quot;Any Way the Wind Blows&quot;, &quot;Hambone&quot;, &quot;Pointed Toe Shoes&quot;, &quot;Sister Twister&quot;, &quot;L-O-V-E-V-I-L-L-E&quot; and other songs.

In 1959, he wrote the country &amp; western song The Ballad of Boot Hill for Johnny Cash who recorded it on an EP for Columbia Records. That same year, Perkins was cast in a Filipino movie produced by People&#x27;s Pictures, &quot;Hawaiian Boy&quot; in which he sang Blue Suede Shoes.

He performed often at the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas in 1962 and 1963. During this time, he toured nine Midwestern states and made a tour in Germany. In 1962, Patsy Cline recorded So Wrong, which Carl wrote with Mel Tillis and Danny Dill, and had a #14 hit on the Country charts.

In May 1964, Perkins toured Britain with Chuck Berry with the popular, young rock group, The Animals backing them. Perkins had been reluctant to undertake the tour, convinced that as forgotten as he had become in America, he would be even more obscure in the U.K. and did not want to be humiliated by drawing meager audiences. Berry assured him that they had remained much more popular in Britain since the 1950s than they had in the United States and that there would be large crowds of fans at every show. On the last night of the tour, Perkins attended a party where he sat on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by the Beatles. Ringo Starr asked if he could record Honey Don&#x27;t. Perkins answered, &quot;Man, go ahead, have at it.&quot; The Beatles later recorded covers of Matchbox, Honey Don&#x27;t and Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby which Perkins adapted from a song originally recorded in 1936 by Rex Griffin which he added new music to. (A song with the same title was recorded by Roy Newman in 1938). Ringo sang the lead on the first two, George Harrison sang a rare lead on the third. The Beatles also recorded two versions of Glad All Over in 1963. Another tour to Germany followed in the autumn.

He released Big Bad Blues backed with Lonely Heart as a single on Brunswick Records with the Nashville Teens in June, 1964.

In 1966, Perkins signed with Dollie Records and released as his first single for them, Country Boy&#x27;s Dream, which reached #22 in the country charts. That same year Bob Luman had a Top 40 Country hit with Carl&#x27;s song Poor Boy Blues.

While on tour with the Johnny Cash show in 1968, Perkins went on a four day drinking binge that ended with him hallucinating floridly and passing out. When he regained consciousness, he went out to the beach with his last bottle of alcohol. In his autobiography, he described falling to his knees and declaring, &quot;Lord, ... I&#x27;m gonna throw this bottle. I&#x27;m gonna show You that I believe in you&quot; before hurling the bottle into the sea and vowing to remain sober. Perkins and Cash, who had his own substance-abuse issues, supported each other in their bids to remain sober.

In 1968, Cash recorded the Perkins-written Daddy Sang Bass which incorporates parts of the gospel standard Will the Circle Be Unbroken. It rose to the top of the country music charts where it stayed for six weeks. It was a Country Music Association nominee for Song of the Year the next year. Perkins also played lead guitar on Cash&#x27;s single A Boy Named Sue, recorded live at San Quentin prison. It went to number one for five weeks on the country chart and number two on the pop chart. (The performance was also filmed by Granada Television for broadcast).

Perkins spent a decade in Cash&#x27;s touring revue, often as an opening act for Cash as at the Folsom and San Quentin prison concerts where he was recorded singing Blue Suede Shoes and Matchbox before Cash took the stage. These performances were not released until the 2000s. He also appeared on the television series &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;. On the television program &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; on April 16, 1969, which Cash hosted, Perkins performed his song Restless.

Perkins and Bob Dylan wrote &quot;Champaign, Illinois&quot; in 1969. Dylan was in Nashville from February 12 to February 21 recording his album &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, a crossover into country. He met Perkins when he appeared on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; on June 7. Dylan had writer&#x27;s block and was unable to complete the song until Perkins contributed the rhythm and some lyrics upon which Dylan said to him, &quot;Your song. Take it. Finish it.&quot; Perkins registered the song as co-authored and recorded it on his 1969 album &quot;On Top&quot;.

Also in 1969, Columbia&#x27;s Murray Krugman placed Perkins with the New Rhythm and Blues Quartet, the NRBQ, a rockabilly group based in New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley. With the group backing him, he recorded two of his staples, &quot;Boppin&#x27; the Blues&quot; and &quot;Turn Around&quot; plus songs they sang separately.

Tommy Cash (brother of Johnny Cash) had a Top Ten country gospel hit in 1970 with the song &quot;Rise and Shine&quot; which Perkins wrote. It reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and number eight on the Canadian country chart. Arlene Harden had a Top 40 country hit in 1971 with the Perkins composition True Love Is Greater Than Friendship, from the film &quot;Little Fauss and Big Halsy&quot; (1971). That same year, Al Martino&#x27;s cover of the song reached number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. Perkins appeared with Cash on the popular TV country series &quot;Hee Haw&quot; on February 16, 1974.

After a long legal struggle with Sam Phillips over royalties, Perkins gained ownership of his songs in the 1970s and, in 2003, his widow, who by then owned the catalog, entered into an administration contract with Paul McCartney&#x27;s MPL Communications.

===Later years===
The rockabilly revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. In 1981, Perkins recorded the song &quot;Get It&quot; with Paul McCartney. According to one source, he fully co-wrote the song with McCartney. This recording was included on the chart-topping album &quot;Tug of War&quot;, released in 1982. During 1985, Perkins re-recorded &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; with Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom of the Stray Cats as part of the soundtrack for the film &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

In October 1985, Perkins performed on stage in London for a television special, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session&quot;, with George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Dave Edmunds, Lee Rocker, Rosanne Cash and Ringo Starr. The show was taped live at the Limehouse Studios. It was broadcast on Channel 4 on January 1, 1986. Perkins sang 16 songs plus two encores, in an extraordinary performance. He and his friends ended the session by singing &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears. The concert special was a highlight of his later career. Fans praised it for Perkins and his guests&#x27; spirited performances. The concert was released for DVD by Snapper Music in 2006.

Perkins was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985. Wider recognition of his contributions to music came with his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. The Hall chose &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; as one of its 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. The song also received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. Perkins was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in recognition of his pioneering contributions to the genre.

Perkins&#x27;s only notable film performance as an actor was in John Landis&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;Into the Night&quot;. The cameo-laden film includes a scene in which characters played by Perkins and David Bowie die by each other&#x27;s hand.

Perkins returned to the Sun Studio in Memphis in 1986, joining Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison on the album &quot;Class of &#x27;55&quot;. The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet jam session involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis in 1956.

In 1989, Perkins co-wrote and played guitar on the Judds&#x27; number-one country hit, &quot;Let Me Tell You About Love&quot;. Also that year, he signed a record deal with Platinum Records for the album &quot;Friends, Family, and Legends&quot; featuring performances by Chet Atkins, Travis Tritt, Steve Wariner, Joan Jett and Charlie Daniels, along with Paul Shaffer and Will Lee. The song Wild Texas Wind became the title track to a made-for-TV movie featuring Dolly Parton and Gary Busey. In 1996, Willie Nelson, who also appeared in that movie, would join Carl in a duet version of the song. During the production of this album, Perkins was diagnosed with throat cancer. 
Dolly Parton had a Top 20 Country hit in 1991 with &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; which she and Perkins co-wrote.

Mark O&#x27;Connor recorded a version of the Perkins classic &quot;Restless&quot; in 1991 and had a #25 Country hit with it in the US, (#19 in Canada).

Perkins again returned to Sun Studio to record with Scotty Moore, Presley&#x27;s first guitar player, for the album &quot;706 ReUNION&quot;, released by Belle Meade Records which also featured D. J. Fontana, Marcus Van Storey and the Jordanaires. In 1993, Perkins performed with the Kentucky Headhunters in a music video remake of his song Dixie Fried filmed in Glasgow, Kentucky. In 1994, he teamed up with Duane Eddy and the Mavericks to contribute Matchbox to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

His last album, &quot;Go Cat Go!&quot;, released by the independent Dinosaur Records label in 1996 showcases Perkins singing duets with Bono, Johnny Cash, John Fogerty, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, Paul Simon, and Ringo Starr.

His last major concert performance was the Music for Montserrat all-star charity concert at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on September 15, 1997, four months before his death.

==Personal life==
A strong advocate for child welfare, Perkins worked with the Jackson Exchange Club to establish the first center in Tennessee for the prevention of child abuse, the fourth in the nation. Proceeds from a concert which he planned were combined with a grant from the National Exchange Club to establish the Prevention of Child Abuse in October 1981. For years, its annual Circle of Hope Telethon generated one quarter of the center&#x27;s annual operating budget.

Perkins had one daughter, Debbie, and three sons, Stan, Greg, and Steve. Stan, Perkins&#x27; firstborn son, is also a recording artist. In 2010, he joined forces with Jerry Naylor to record a duet tribute, &quot;To Carl: Let It Vibrate&quot;. Stan has been inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Greg played bass on stage alongside his father at the 1985 &quot;Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session&quot; concert in London and co-wrote &quot;Birth of Rock and Roll&quot; with his father. In 1983, a jury in Jackson, Tennessee found Greg Perkins &quot;innocent on two felony counts of vehicular homicide, and guilty on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of alcohol.&quot; In 1997, Perkins&#x27; wife Valda was &quot;recovering from a yearlong illness,&quot; and his son Greg collapsed as a result of liver damage that may have resulted in a liver transplant.

Perkins died on January 19, 1998, at the age of 65 at Jackson-Madison County Hospital in Jackson, Tennessee, from complications from several minor strokes the previous month. Among the mourners at his standing room only funeral at Lambuth University were George Harrison, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Wynonna Judd, Sam Phillips, Ricky Skaggs, Brian Setzer, Garth Brooks, and Billy Ray Cyrus. During the service, Cyrus and Skaggs sang and the funeral ended with George Harrison singing an acoustic version of &quot;Your True Love&quot;. Perkins was buried at Ridgecrest Cemetery in Jackson.

Perkins&#x27; widow, Valda deVere Perkins, died on November 15, 2005, in Jackson. Carl and Valda Perkins&#x27; son Greg (born January 15, 1959) died three days later at the age of 46 on November 18, 2005.
==Technique==
As a guitarist, Perkins used finger picking, imitations of the pedal steel guitar, palm muting, arpeggios, open strings, single and double string bending, chromaticism, country and blues licks, and tritone and other tonality clashing licks (short phrases that include notes from other keys and move in logical, often symmetric patterns). A rich vocabulary of chords including sixth and thirteenth chords, ninth and added ninth chords, and suspensions show up in his rhythm parts and solos. Free use of syncopations, chord anticipations (arriving at a chord change before the other players, often by an eighth-note) and crosspicking (repeating a three eighth-note pattern so that an accent falls variously on the upbeat or downbeat) were also in his bag of tricks.

==Legacy==
Perkins wrote his autobiography, &quot;Go, Cat, Go&quot;, published in 1996, in collaboration with music writer David McGee in 1996. Plans for a biographical film were announced by Santa Monica-based production company Fastlane Entertainment; it was slated for release in 2009.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Perkins number 99 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

The National Recording Preservation Board included his version of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; in its National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2006.

The Perkins family still owns his songs.

Ricky Nelson covered Perkins&#x27;s Boppin&#x27; the Blues and Your True Love on his 1957 debut album, &quot;Ricky&quot;.

Many of the Beatles&#x27; live shows had rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll covers of Carl Perkins&#x27;s songs such as Everybody&#x27;s Trying To Be My Baby, Matchbox and Honey Don&#x27;t.

Drive-By Truckers, on their album &quot;The Dirty South&quot;, recorded a song about him, &quot;Carl Perkins&#x27; Cadillac&quot;.
The Carl Perkins Arena in Jackson, Tennessee, is named in his honor.

&quot;George Thorogood and the Destroyers&quot; covered Dixie Fried on their 1985 album &quot;Maverick&quot;. The Kentucky Headhunters also covered the song, as did Keith de Groot on his 1968 album &quot;No Introduction Necessary&quot; with Jimmy Page on lead guitar and John Paul Jones on bass.

Johnny &quot;Kid Memphis&quot; Holiday portrayed Perkins by in the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic &quot;Walk the Line&quot;.

Perkins was honored with the Lifetime Achievement award during the Tennessee Music Awards event in 2018 at the University of Memphis Lambuth in Jackson, Tennessee.

<text>Green anarchism, also known as ecological anarchism or eco-anarchism, is an anarchist school of thought that focuses on ecology and environmental issues. It is an anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian form of radical environmentalism, which emphasises social organization, freedom and self-fulfillment.

Ecological approaches to anarchism were first formulated during the 19th century, as the rise of capitalism and colonialism caused environmental degradation. Drawing from the ecology of Charles Darwin, the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin elaborated a naturalist philosophy that rejected the dualistic separation of humanity from nature. This was developed into an ecological philosophy by Peter Kropotkin and Élisée Reclus, who advocated for the decentralisation and degrowth of industry as a means to advance both social justice and environmental protection.

Green anarchism was first developed into a distinct political theory by sections of the New Left, as a revival in anarchism coincided with the emergence of an environmental movement. From the 1970s onwards, three main tendencies of green anarchism were established: Murray Bookchin elaborated the theory of social ecology, which argues that environmental issues stem directly from social issues; Arne Næss defined the theory of deep ecology, which advocates for biocentrism; and John Zerzan developed the theory of anarcho-primitivism, which calls for the abolition of technology and civilization. In the 21st century, these tendencies were joined by total liberation, which centres animal rights, and green syndicalism, which calls for the workers themselves to manage deindustrialisation.

At its core, green anarchism concerns itself with the identification and abolition of social hierarchies that cause environmental degradation. Opposed to the extractivism and productivism of industrial capitalism, it advocates for the degrowth and deindustrialisation of the economy. It also pushes for greater localisation and decentralisation, proposing forms of municipalism, bioregionalism or a &quot;return to nature&quot; as possible alternatives to the state.

==History==
===Background===
Before the Industrial Revolution, the only occurrences of ecological crisis were small-scale, localised to areas affected by natural disasters, overproduction or war. But as the enclosure of common land increasingly forced dispossessed workers into factories, more wide-reaching ecological damage began to be noticed by radicals of the period.

During the late 19th century, as capitalism and colonialism were reaching their height, political philosophers first began to develop critiques of industrialised society, which had caused a rise in pollution and environmental degradation. In response, these early environmentalists developed a concern for nature and wildlife conservation, soil erosion, deforestation, and natural resource management. Early political approaches to environmentalism were supplemented by the literary naturalism of writers such as Henry David Thoreau, John Muir and Ernest Thompson Seton, whose best-selling works helped to alter the popular perception of nature by rejecting the dualistic &quot;man against nature&quot; conflict. In particular, Thoreau&#x27;s advocacy of anti-consumerism and vegetarianism, as well as his love for the wilderness, has been a direct inspiration for many eco-anarchists.

Ecology in its modern form was developed by Charles Darwin, whose work on evolutionary biology provided a scientific rejection of Christian and Cartesian anthropocentrism, instead emphasising the role of probability and individual agency in the process of evolution. Around the same time, anarchism emerged as a political philosophy that rejected all forms of hierarchy, authority and oppression, and instead advocated for decentralisation and voluntary association. The framework for an ecological anarchism was thus set in place, as a means to reject anthropocentric hierarchies that positioned humans in a dominating position over nature.

===Roots===
The ecological roots of anarchism go back to the classical anarchists, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin, who both conceived of human nature as the basis for anarchism. Drawing from Charles Darwin&#x27;s work, Bakunin considered people to be an intrinsic part of their environment. Bakunin rejected Cartesian dualism, denying its anthropocentric and mechanistic separation of humanity from nature. However, he also saw humans as uniquely capable of self-determination and called for humanity to achieve a mastery of its own natural environment as a means to achieve freedom. Bakunin&#x27;s naturalism was developed into an ecological philosophy by the geographers Peter Kropotkin and Éliseé Reclus, who conceived the relationship between human society and nature as a dialectic. Their environmental ethics, which combined social justice with environmental protection, anticipated the green anarchist philosophies of social ecology and bioregionalism.
Like Bakunin before him, Kropotkin extolled the domestication of nature by humans, but also framed humanity as an intrinsic part of its natural environment and placed great value in the natural world. Kropotkin was among the first environmentalist thinkers to note the connections between industrialisation, environmental degradation and workers&#x27; alienation. In contrast to Marxists, who called for an increase in industrialisation, Kropotkin argued for the localisation of the economy, which he felt would increase people&#x27;s connection with the land and halt environmental damage. In &quot;Fields, Factories and Workshops&quot;, Kropotkin advocated for the satisfaction of human needs through horticulture, and the decentralisation and degrowth of industry. He also criticised the division of labour, both between mental and manual labourers, and between the rural peasantry and urban proletariat. In &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot;, he elaborated on the natural basis for communism, depicting the formation of social organisation among animals through the practice of mutual aid. 

Reclus himself argued that environmental degradation caused by industrialisation, exemplified to him by mass deforestation in the Pacific Northwest, was characteristic of the &quot;barbarity&quot; of modern civilisation, which he felt subordinated both workers and the environment to the goal of capital accumulation. Reclus was also one of the earliest figures to develop the idea of &quot;total liberation&quot;, directly comparing the exploitation of labour with cruelty to animals and thus advocating for both human and animal rights. 

Kropotkin and Reclus&#x27; synthesis of environmental and social justice formed the foundation for eco-socialism, chiefly associated with libertarian socialists who advocated for a &quot;return to nature&quot;, such as Robert Blatchford, William Morris and Henry Salt. Ecological aspects of anarchism were also emphasised by Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who, drawing from the work of Henry David Thoreau, conceived of anarchism as a means to promote unity between humans and the natural world. These early ecological developments in anarchism lay the foundations for the elaboration of green anarchism in the 1960s, when it was first taken up by figures within the New Left.

===Development===
Green anarchism first emerged after the dawn of the Atomic Age, as increasingly centralized governments brought with them a new host of environmental and social issues. During the 1960s, the rise of the environmental movement coincided with a concurrent revival of interest in anarchism, leading to anarchists having a considerable influence on the development of radical environmentalist thought. Principles and practices that already formed the core of anarchist philosophy, from direct action to community organizing, thus became foundational to radical environmentalism. As the threats presented by environmental degradation, industrial agriculture and pollution became more urgent, the first green anarchists turned to decentralisation and diversity as solutions for socio-ecological systems.
Green anarchism as a tendency was first developed by the American social anarchist Murray Bookchin. Bookchin had already began addressing the problem of environmental degradation as far back as the 1950s. In 1962, he published the first major modern work of environmentalism, &quot;Our Synthetic Environment&quot;, which warned of the ecological dangers of pesticide application. Over the subsequent decades, Bookchin developed the first theory of green anarchism, social ecology, which presented social hierarchy as the root of ecological problems.

In 1973, Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss developed another green anarchist tendency, known as deep ecology, which rejected of anthropocentrism in favour of biocentrism. In 1985, this philosophy was developed into a political programme by the American academics Bill Devall and George Sessions, while Australian philosopher Warwick Fox proposed the formation of bioregions as a green anarchist alternative to the nation state. 

Following on from deep ecology, the next major development in green anarchist philosophy was the articulation of anarcho-primitivism, which was critical of agriculture, technology and civilisation. First developed in the pages of the American anarchist magazine &quot;Fifth Estate&quot; during the mid-1980s, anarcho-primitivist theory was developed by Fredy Perlman, David Watson, and particularly John Zerzan. It was later taken up by the American periodical &quot;Green Anarchy&quot; and British periodical &quot;Green Anarchist&quot;, and partly inspired groups such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and Individualists Tending to the Wild (ITS).

===From theory to practice===

By the 1970s, radical environmentalist groups had begun to carry out direct action against nuclear power infrastructure, with mobilisations of the anti-nuclear movement in France, Germany and the United States providing a direct continuity between contemporary environmentalism and the New Left of the 1960s. In the 1980s, green anarchist groups such as Earth First! started taking direct action against deforestation, roadworks and industrial agriculture. They called their sabotage actions &quot;monkey-wrenching&quot;, after Edward Abbey&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;. During the 1990s, the road protest movements in the United Kingdom and Israel were also driven by eco-anarchists, while eco-anarchist action networks such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and Earth Liberation Front (ELF) first rose to prominence. Eco-anarchist actions have included violent attacks, such as those carried out by cells of the Informal Anarchist Federation (IAF) and Individualists Tending to the Wild (ITS) against nuclear scientists and nanotechnology researchers respectively.
As environmental degradation was accelerated by the rise of economic globalisation and neoliberalism, green anarchists broadened their scope of action from a specific environmentalist focus into one that agitated for global justice. Green anarchists were instrumental in the establishment of the anti-globalisation movement (AGM), as well as its transformation into the subsequent global justice movement (GJM). The AGM gained support in both the Global North and Global South, with the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) becoming a key organisation within the movement. It also gained a wide range of support from different sectors of society, not only including activists from left-wing politics or the environmental and peace movements, but also people from trade unions, church groups and the agricultural sector. Trade unionists were the most prominent presence at the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, even outnumbering the environmentalists and anarchists. Drawing from its anarchist roots, the AGM adopted a decentralised and non-hierarchical model of horizontal organisation, embracing new &quot;anarchical&quot; technologies such as the internet as a means to network and communicate. Through the environmental and anti-globalisation movements, contemporary anarchism was ultimately able to achieve a &quot;quasi-renaissance&quot; in anarchist ideas, tendencies and modes of organisation.

=== Contemporary theoretical developments ===
Writers such as Murray Bookchin and Alan Carter have claimed contemporary anarchism to be the only political movement capable of addressing climate change. In his 1996 book &quot;Ecology and Anarchism&quot;, British anthropologist Brian Morris argued that anarchism is intrinsically environmentalist, as it shared the ecologist principles of decentralisation, non-hierarchical social organisation and interdependence.

By the 21st century, green anarchists had begun to move beyond the previous century&#x27;s divisions into social ecologist and anarcho-primitivist camps, establishing a new body of theory that rejected the dualisms of humanity against nature and civilisation against wilderness. Drawing on the biocentric philosophy of deep ecology, in 2006, Mark Somma called for a &quot;revolutionary environmentalism&quot; capable of overthrowing capitalism, reducing consumption and organising the conservation of biodiversity. Somma championed a form of solidarity between humanity and the non-human natural world, in a call that was taken up in 2009 by Steven Best, who called for eco-anarchists to commit themselves to &quot;total liberation&quot; and extend solidarity to animals. To Best, morality ought to be extended to animals due to their sentience and capacity to feel pain; he has called for the abolition of the hierarchy between humans and animals, although he implicitly excludes non-sentient plants from this moral consideration.
Drawing from eco-feminism, pattrice jones called for human solidarity with both plants and animals, neither of which she considered to be lesser than humans, even describing them as &quot;natural anarchists&quot; that do not recognise or obey any government&#x27;s laws.

In 2012, Jeff Shantz developed a theory of &quot;green syndicalism&quot;, which seeks to use of syndicalist models of workplace organisation to link the labour movement with the environmental movement.

==Branches==

===Social ecology===
The green anarchist theory of social ecology is based on an analysis of the relationship between society and nature. Social ecology considers human society to be both the cause of and solution to environmental degradation, envisioning the creation of a rational and ecological society through a process of sociocultural evolution. Social ecologist Murray Bookchin saw society itself as a natural product of evolution, which intrinsically tended toward ever-increasing complexity and diversity. While he saw human society as having the potential to become &quot;nature rendered self-conscious&quot;, in &quot;The Ecology of Freedom&quot;, Bookchin elaborated that the emergence of hierarchy had given way to a disfigured form of society that was both ecologically and socially destructive.

According to social ecology, the oppression of humans by humans directly preceded the exploitation of the environment by hierarchical society, which itself caused a vicious circle of increasing socio-ecological devastation. Considering social hierarchy to go against the natural evolutionary tendencies towards complexity and diversity, social ecology concludes that oppressive hierarchies have to be abolished in order to resolve the ecological crisis. Bookchin thus proposed a decentralised system of direct democracy, centred locally in the municipality, where people themselves could participate in decision making. He envisioned a self-organized system of popular assemblies to replace the state and re-educate individuals into socially and ecologically-minded citizens.
===Deep ecology===
The theory of deep ecology rejects anthropocentrism in favour of biocentrism, which recognizes the intrinsic value of all life, regardless of its utility to humankind. Unlike social ecologists, theorists of deep ecology considered human society to be incapable of reversing environmental degradation and, as a result, proposed a drastic reduction in world population. The solutions to human overpopulation proposed by deep ecologists included bioregionalism, which advocated the replacement of the nation state with bioregions, as well as a widespread return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Some deep ecologists, including members of Earth First!, have even welcomed the mass death caused by disease and famine as a form of population control.
===Anarcho-primitivism===
The theory of anarcho-primitivism aims its critique at the emergence of technology, agriculture and civilisation, which it considers to have been the source of all social problems. According to American primitivist theorist John Zerzan, it was the division of labour in agricultural societies that had first given way to the social inequality and alienation which became characteristic of modernity. As such, Zerzan proposed the abolition of technology and science, in order for society to be broken down and humans to return to a hunter-gather lifestyle. Libertarian socialists such as Noam Chomsky and Michael Albert have been critical of anarcho-primitivism, with the former arguing that it would inevitably result in genocide.
===Green syndicalism===
Green syndicalism, as developed by Graham Purchase and Judi Bari, advocates for the unification of the labour movement with environmental movement and for trade unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) to adopt ecological concerns into their platforms. Seeing workers&#x27; self-management as a means to address environmental degradation, green syndicalism pushes for workers to agitate their colleagues, sabotage environmentally destructive practices in their workplaces, and form workers&#x27; councils. Green syndicalist Jeff Shantz proposed that a free association of producers would be best positioned to dismantle the industrial economy, through the decentralisation and localisation of production. In contrast to Marxism and anarcho-syndicalism, green syndicalism opposes mass production and rejects the idea that the industrial economy has a &quot;liberatory potential&quot;; but it also rejects the radical environmentalist calls for a &quot;complete, immediate break with industrialism&quot;.

==Theory==
Although a diverse body of thought, eco-anarchist theory has a fundamental basis unified by certain shared principles. Eco-anarchism considers there to be a direct connection between the problems of environmental degradation and hierarchy, and maintains an anti-capitalist critique of productivism and industrialism. Emphasising decentralisation and community ownership, it also advocates for the degrowth of the economy and the re-centring of social relations around local communities and bioregions.
===Critique of civilisation===
Green anarchism traces the roots of all forms of oppression to the widespread transition from hunting and gathering to sedentary lifestyles. According to green anarchism, the foundation of civilisation was defined by the extraction and importation of natural resources, which led to the formation of hierarchy through capital accumulation and the division of labour. Green anarchists are therefore critical of civilisation and its manifestations in globalized capitalism, which they consider to be causing a societal and ecological collapse that necessitates a &quot;return to nature&quot;. Green anarchists uphold direct action as a form of resistance against civilisation, which they wish to replace with a way of simple living in harmony with nature. This may involve cultivating self-sustainability, practising survivalism or rewilding.

=== Decentralisation ===
Eco-anarchism considers the rise of states to be the primary cause of environmental degradation, as states promote greater industrial extraction and production as means to remain competitive with other state powers, even at the expense of the environment. Drawing from the ecological principle of &quot;unity in diversity&quot;, eco-anarchism also recognises humans as an intrinsic part of the ecosystem that they live in and how their culture, history and language is shaped by their local environments. Eco-anarchists therefore argue for the abolition of states and their replacement with stateless societies, upholding various forms of localism and bioregionalism.
=== Deindustrialisation ===
Ecological anarchism considers the exploitation of labour under capitalism within a broader ecological context, holding that environmental degradation is intrinsically linked with societal oppression. As such, green anarchism is opposed to industrialism, due to both its social and ecological affects.

<text>Mount Holyoke College is a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college in South Hadley, Massachusetts, United States. It is the oldest member of the historic Seven Sisters colleges, a group of historically women’s colleges in the Northeastern United States. The college was founded in 1837 as the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary by Mary Lyon, a pioneer in education for women. Mount Holyoke is part of the Five College Consortium in Western Massachusetts.

Undergraduate admissions are restricted to female, transgender, and nonbinary students. In 2014, it became the first member of the Seven Sisters (not counting the coeducational Vassar College) to introduce an admissions policy that was inclusive of transgender students. Graduate programs are open to applicants regardless of gender.

The college&#x27;s campus includes the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum, the John Payson Williston Observatory, and a botanic garden. The college awards the Glascock Prize annually.

== History ==


Mount Holyoke was founded in 1837 by Mary Lyon as Mount Holyoke Female Seminary. Lyon developed her ideas on how to educate women when she was assistant principal at Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts. By 1837 she had convinced multiple sponsors to support her ideals and the nation&#x27;s first real college for women. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary opened on November 8, 1837, in South Hadley, Massachusetts. The town had donated the land and main building. Lyon&#x27;s layout of the campus provided a widely imitated model for the higher education of women by providing a physical environment that supported a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum equivalent to that of men&#x27;s colleges. Lyon&#x27;s innovative goals set her Seminary apart from other female seminaries of the period, offering a curriculum equivalent to those at men&#x27;s colleges. All the students worked in one building with little privacy. There was close contact with the all-female faculty, and daily self reports on their personal strengths and weaknesses. The college cut staff to the minimum as the 100 or so students each performed one hour of work a day, handling most of the routine chores like cooking and cleaning and maintaining the grounds. Lyon rejected the goal of the men&#x27;s colleges to promote individualism and independence and instead fostered the collective ideal of a united team of women could match the success of nearby men&#x27;s colleges like Amherst and Williams. The curriculum allowed women to study subjects like geometry, calculus, Latin, Greek, science, philosophy, and history, which were not typically taught at other female seminaries in the 19th century. Lyon&#x27;s efforts in founding an institution of higher education for women, despite the economic challenges of the time, paved the way for more women to have the same opportunities for higher education as their brothers.

Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was one of several Christian institutions of higher education for young women established during the first half of the 19th century. Prior to founding Mount Holyoke, Lyon contributed to the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of &quot;Wheaton Female Seminary&quot; (now Wheaton College) in 1834. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was chartered as a teaching seminary in 1836 and opened its doors to students on November 8, 1837. Both Vassar College and Wellesley College were patterned after Mount Holyoke.

According to historian Amanda Porterfield, Lyon created Mount Holyoke to be &quot;a religious institution that offered a model of Christian society for all to see.&quot; Students &quot;were required to attend church services, chapel talks, prayer meetings, and Bible study groups. Twice a day teachers and students spent time in private devotions. Every dorm room had two large lighted closets to give roommates privacy during their devotions&quot;. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was the sister school to Andover Seminary. By 1859 there were more than 60 missionary alumnae; by 1887 the school&#x27;s alumnae comprised one-fifth of all female American missionaries for the ABCFM; and by the end of the century, 248 of its alumnae had entered the mission field.

=== Collegiate charter ===
Mount Holyoke Female Seminary received its collegiate charter in 1888, becoming Mount Holyoke Seminary and College. The change in admission from Seminary to College included fundraising by the trustees, an overhaul of the entrance requirements, and course catalog. Entrance exams were introduced at this time, scheduled in June or September at the college. In 1889, students traveling from the midwest could take these examinations in Freeport, Illinois, and within a few years, this was expanded to other cities. Many additions were made to the course catalog, and starting in the 1889 academic year, students could choose to pursue degrees of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. Within 4 years, the seminary enrollment dropped from 269 to 8. In 1893, the seminary course was discontinued, and the new title Mount Holyoke College was authorized.

=== Cottage-style living ===
A movement towards what was referred to as cottage-style living started in 1889 by the New York Association after the change to Mount Holyoke Seminary and College. $15,000 was raised, and plans were put in place for Mary Brigham Cottage, with accommodations for the president and thirty students, with priority given to those in the collegiate course. At the time, two South Hadley families agreed to host boarders. President Elizabeth Mead deemed these options unsatisfactory and pushed the trustees to build yet another cottage. Mrs. Mead was ready to relieve the students of a large share of the drudgery of domestic work that had made up a good portion of their studies since Mary Lyon&#x27;s conception of the seminary. From 1895 to 1996 the trustees allotted funds for the employment of four women to wash the dinner dishes that had formerly constituted the task of eight or ten students.

On February 28, 1987, the United States Postal Service&#x27;s Great Americans series issued a postage stamp featuring Mary Lyon, in honor of Mount Holyoke&#x27;s &quot;Sesquicentennial&quot; (Mount Holyoke&#x27;s 150th anniversary).

=== Debate on becoming co-educational ===
In the early 1970s, Mount Holyoke had a long debate under the presidency of David Truman over the issue of coeducation. On November 6, 1971, the board of trustees voted to remain a women&#x27;s college.

=== Admission of transgender students ===
At Convocation on September 2, 2014, President Lynn Pasquerella announced a new policy allowing the admission of transgender individuals of both sexes to the college, as well as the admission of students whose gender identities are non-binary. Of the Seven Sisters that had remained women&#x27;s colleges, Mount Holyoke was the first to implement such policy.

At Convocation on September 3, 2024, the College launched TGNC10 @ MHC, described as &quot;a trans and gender nonconforming (TGNC)-led, student-led project sponsored by Mount Holyoke College (MHC) in commemoration of the 10-year anniversary of MHC’s gender-inclusive admissions policy, which was established as the result of student activism through the &#x27;Open Gates&#x27; initiative.&quot;

== Admissions ==
The 2020 annual ranking by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes Mount Holyoke as &quot;more selective&quot;.

For the Class of 2027 (enrolling fall 2023), Mount Holyoke received 5,030 applications, accepted 1,926 (38.3%), and enrolled 587. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolled students was 1360–1470 for the composite, 690–750 for evidence-based reading and writing, and 660–750 for math, while the middle 50% range for the ACT composite score was 31–33.

== Rankings ==
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2025 rankings ranked Mount Holyoke tied for the 34th-best liberal arts college in the nation, and tied for 35th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;. In 2023, according to a ranking by the Princeton Review which assessed students&#x27; perceptions of their faculty, Mount Holyoke&#x27;s faculty was ranked #9 in the nation. The ranking was based on students&#x27; level of agreement or disagreement with the statement, &quot;Professors are interesting and bring their material to life.&quot; As of 2023, Mount Holyoke was ranked #6 in the Princeton Review&#x27;s ranking of the &quot;Top 20 Best Schools for Making an Impact&quot;.

Mount Holyoke College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

In 2025, the college ranked 205 out of 257 top colleges in a free speech ranking by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and &quot;College Pulse,&quot; after ranking at 155 in 2024 and 159 in 2022/2023.

== Academics ==
=== Undergraduate programs ===
Mount Holyoke offers 50 departmental and interdepartmental majors, including the option to design a special major. The most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
::Experimental Psychology (45)

At least 68 credits must be earned from coursework outside the major department, across the three curricular divisions: humanities, science and mathematics, and social sciences. Study of a foreign language and completion of a multicultural perspectives course is also required.

Mount Holyoke&#x27;s membership in the Five College Consortium allows students to enroll in courses at nearby Amherst College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. They may also complete one of 12 Five College Certificates—among them African studies, Buddhist studies, coastal and marine sciences, cognitive neuroscience, international relations, and Middle Eastern studies—in lieu of a minor.

=== Graduate programs ===

In addition to the BA, Mount Holyoke offers three master&#x27;s degrees: a coed Master of Arts in Teaching, a Master of Arts in mathematics teaching, and a master&#x27;s in psychology. Other programs include dual-degree programs in engineering with the California Institute of Technology, the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; the Frances Perkins Program, for women over the age of 24 who wish to complete the requirements for a Bachelor of Arts degree; and the Postbaccalaureate Studies Program, for students who have already earned an undergraduate degree and wish to complete additional course work in preparation for graduate work in medicine, nursing, veterinary medicine, dentistry, or physical therapy science.

== Academic centers and programs ==
Four academic centers—the Weissman Center for Leadership, the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives, the Miller Worley Center for the Environment, and the Intergroup Dialogue Center—support the academic program through public lectures by visiting scholars, conferences on issues of pressing concern, mentoring and internship opportunities, and hands-on learning experiences. The Weissman Center&#x27;s Speaking, Arguing, and Writing (SAW) Program provides opportunities for developing leadership and communication skills, including the ability to effectively frame, articulate, and advocate positions. The Community-Based Learning Program links students with community-based organizations in courses that combine analysis and action.

=== Study abroad ===
Mount Holyoke has study abroad programs and exchanges for full-year or semester study in France, Senegal, Costa Rica, Chile, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, as well as a summer program in China and January term programs in Georgia and South Africa. The college is also affiliated with more than 150 study abroad programs in more than 50 colleges and students have the opportunity to petition any programs with which the college is not already affiliated. The college also encourages international internships and research for the semester, year, summer, or January terms. Each year more than 200 Mount Holyoke students, representing approximately 40 percent of the junior class, study for a semester or academic year at universities and programs abroad.

=== Twelve College Exchange ===
Through the school&#x27;s membership in the Twelve College Exchange program, Mount Holyoke students can study at one of the following 12 other schools for one semester or a full year:
* Amherst College
* Bowdoin College
* Connecticut College
* Dartmouth College
* National Theatre Institute at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center
* Smith College
* Trinity College
* Vassar College
* Wellesley College

== Faculty ==
A number of faculty are nationally and internationally recognized for their research and writing achievements, including Christopher Benfey (literary scholar), Joseph Ellis (historian), Susan Barry (neurobiologist), Mark McMenamin (geologist and paleontologist) and Becky Wai-Ling Packard (psychologist). Mark McMenamin&#x27;s Hypertopia Option has been called one of only two methods &quot;by which planetary temperature can be stabilized.&quot;

=== Attempted murder of faculty member ===
Mount Holyoke administrator and art professor Rie Hachiyanagi made international headlines when she was charged with the attempted murder of a regular member of the faculty on 23 December 2019. Hachiyanagi used a fire poker, large rock, and a gardening shears to attempt to beat and kill her victim. Hachiyanagi&#x27;s alleged victim survived the attack. Hachiyanagi pled guilty to the charges and on October 20, 2021, was sentenced to a term of 10 to 12 years in prison.

== Campus ==

The campus was designed and landscaped between 1896 and 1922 by the landscape architecture firm of Olmsted and Sons. The campus includes a botanic garden, two lakes, several waterfalls, tennis courts, stables, and woodland riding trails. It is also home to the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum which is part of the Five College Museums/Historic Deerfield and the Museums10. An independent bookstore, The Odyssey Bookshop, is located directly across from the campus in the college-owned Village Commons. Mount Holyoke has instituted &quot;The Big Turn Off&quot; energy conservation campaign. It also focuses on &quot;green&quot; building with five LEED certified buildings on campus. It has reduced its environmental impact by recycling 40% of waste and composting as well as using produce grown in the student-run organic garden in dining halls.

The Seminary Building (1837) contained classrooms, parlors and rooms for students and faculty, the original library, and a periodical reading room. A south wing was added in 1841, a north wing in 1853, and a gymnasium and laundry in 1865. All were destroyed by fire in 1896. Upon the burning of the college building in September 1896, Treasurer Williston announced the pressing need for a new chapel building, a new gymnasium, and a series of cottage dormitories in the modern style. This style of separated buildings allowed for flexibility in fundraising that was attractive to the trustees, while still providing the students with the resources and accommodations they needed. In 1897, Mary Lyon Hall and Mary Lyon Chapel were built, as well as dormitories Brigham, Safford, Porter, and Pearsons. Blanchard Gymnasium was completed in 1899.

John Payson Williston Observatory, completed in 1881, was given in memory of the Willistons&#x27; eldest son and built to be ready for the rare transit of Venus in 1882. It is the oldest academic building on campus.

Mount Holyoke has been recognized for its campus beauty by &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;The Princeton Review,&quot; and &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;. Its oldest building dated back to the school&#x27;s opening in 1837, but it burned down in 1896 and was replaced by buildings that opened the following year. Additional buildings were constructed, remodeled, torn down, and expanded at various points from the 1870s to the 2010s, most recently with a new residence hall in 2008 and the construction of a centralized dining hall in 2018. 
The school owns an 18-hole golf course, The Orchards, which was designed by Donald Ross and which hosted the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open in 2004.

== Library ==

Mount Holyoke&#x27;s library includes more than 740,000 print volumes, 1,600 periodicals, and more than 140,000 electronic resources. Its first librarian was an alumna Mary Nutting. Through the Five College Consortium, students have access to more than 9 million volumes. Computer support is provided. The MEWS (Mediated Educational Work Space) supports collaborative multimedia learning with group project rooms, wall-mounted plasma displays, a digitization center, and a faculty development area. In 2013, &quot;Clear and Gold Tower&quot;, a glass sculpture by Dale Chihuly, was installed in the Williston Library&#x27;s atrium.

== Dormitories ==
The college has 21 residence halls as well as apartments and &quot;annex&quot; spaces in which to house students, and an overwhelming majority of students live on campus (98%). Each residence hall reserves a quarter of its rooms for housing first-year students. Most residence halls house students from all four class years at any given time. In January 2018, Mount Holyoke opened a new centralized dining commons within the previously existing Blanchard Community Center. Previously, six dormitories on campus had dining areas inside of them, but the plan to consolidate these into one dining hall was made so that the college could shift to accept an unlimited meal plan and offer extended hours.

== Memberships ==
Mount Holyoke is a member of the Pioneer Valley&#x27;s Five College Consortium, the Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges, the Annapolis Group, the Oberlin Group, and the Consortium on Financing Higher Education.

== Student demographics ==
In 2023, Mount Holyoke&#x27;s undergraduate student body was 50% white, 22% international, 7% Asian, 9% Hispanic, 5% black, and 5% multiracial.

=== Student groups ===
Mount Holyoke offers a number of student groups and organizations. Themes include Art, Academics, Club Sports, Entertainment &amp; the Performing Arts, Politics &amp; Activism, Governing Organizations and Religious organizations.

Among these student groups is Mount Holyoke News, the college&#x27;s independent, student-run publication which has been in print since 1917. Mount Holyoke News, or MHN, publishes on a biweekly basis throughout the academic year with new issues going out in print form every other Friday. A digital edition of each issue is also made available online through the publishing platform Issuu.

WMHC (91.5 FM) is a radio station licensed to serve South Hadley, Massachusetts. The station is owned by Mount Holyoke College and is one of the oldest stations run by women.

== Traditions ==

=== Mount Holyoke class colors ===
Mount Holyoke classes have been voting on class colors and mascots since the late 1800s, but the colors currently in use were not adopted until 1901. The class of 1901 chose hunter green, and the classes of 1902, 1903, 1904 voted for crimson, golden yellow, and royal blue, respectively. In 1909, the students voted for lion, griffin, sphinx, and pegasus as their class symbols. They also decided that even-year classes would use pegasus and lion and their colors would be red and blue, and odd years would use griffin and sphinx, with green and yellow as their colors. This system has persisted to this day. Each class proudly displays their class color at class-related activities such as Convocation.

=== Events ===
* The Kathryn Irene Glascock Awards grants &quot;The Glascock Prize&quot; to the winner of this annual event (which has been held at Mount Holyoke since 1924).
* The Faculty Show takes place once every four years, around April 1; faculty members create a show which parodies themselves and their students.
* The Junior Show (also known as &quot;J-Show&quot;) refers to a show created by Juniors (and a few professors) who parody life at Mount Holyoke. A common feature is a sketch mocking the president and dean of the college, along with well-known professors.
* Mountain Day begins with the sound of ringing bells from Abbey Chapel on a beautiful autumn morning secretly chosen by the president of the college, all classes are canceled for the day and many students hike to the summit of nearby Mount Holyoke.
*Holiday Vespers is an annual Christmas concert that has been held each year since 1899. In addition to the free performance held on campus in Abbey Chapel, each year the students perform in either Boston or New York City.
*M&amp;Cs, originally called Milk &amp; Crackers, is now referred to as Milk &amp; Cookies. M&amp;Cs are a nightly snack provided by dormitory dining halls, but also refer to a student &quot;a cappella&quot; group, The M&amp;Cs (Milk and Cookies).
*Big/Little Sibling is a reference to the pairing of juniors and &quot;firsties&quot; (or first-years) who are paired up to take part in organized events together. Coordinated by the junior class board.
*Pangy Day, originally called Pangynaskeia, has been a springtime tradition at Mount Holyoke for decades, but its origin is not totally clear. It&#x27;s about celebrating spring after a long winter, and festivities including music, games, face-painting, ice cream, and more take place.
*Elfing is a tradition shared between sophomores and first-years. Secret sophomore &quot;elves&quot; leave presents and treats for their first years throughout the week-long event. On the final day, the first-years get to meet their elves in person at a special M&amp;Cs.
*Founder&#x27;s Day is held on the Sunday closest to 8 November (the date of the opening of Mount Holyoke in 1837). It was begun by Elizabeth Storrs Mead in 1891. The current version of the tradition includes ice cream being served early in the morning near Mary Lyon&#x27;s grave. The current president of the college and select faculty are invited to scoop ice cream for the senior class who dons their gowns.
*Convocation is a spirited celebration of community marking the beginning of the academic year. All students attend wearing their class colors, and seniors wear their graduation gowns to celebrate the start of their final year.
*Canoe Sing is an event that takes place prior to commencement in which canoes are decorated with lanterns and paddled by seniors singing Mount Holyoke songs. They are joined by fellow graduating seniors on shore.
*Baccalaureate is held in Abbey Chapel; the medieval German ode to Academe, &quot;Gaudeamus Igitur&quot;, is sung by berobed Seniors and Faculty during the procession. Following convocation, Faculty line the path to Mary Lyon&#x27;s grave. Seniors walk through this throng, to the grave (to place a wreath). The Baccalaureate Ceremony is a celebration that honors members of the graduating class. This traditional ceremony is for seniors only and holds a deep meaning: students are given a final charge and hear from their selected faculty and classmates. Academic regalia and a cap is worn.
*The Laurel Parade takes place the day before commencement. Graduating seniors wear white and carry laurel garlands, in a parade to Mary Lyon&#x27;s grave. They are escorted by approximately 3,000 alumnae, also in white, who thereby welcome them into the Alumnae Association. Once at Mary Lyon&#x27;s grave, the garland is wound around the cast-iron fence, and the Mimi Fariña song &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; is sung by all in attendance. White is a tribute to those who fought for women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1970 students voted to replace the laurel with signs protesting the Vietnam War.

== Athletics ==
Mount Holyoke offers 13 varsity sports programs and six competitive club sports teams. The college is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III and the New England Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) as well as the New England Rowing Conference (NERC).

== Notable people ==


== In popular culture ==

=== Literature ===

* Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s 1977 play, &quot;Uncommon Women and Others&quot;, is based upon Wasserstein&#x27;s experiences at Mount Holyoke of the early 1970s. The play explores the lives of the fictional characters Carter, Holly, Kate, Leilah, Rita, Muffet, Samantha, and Susie as they gather for lunch five years after graduation and reminisce about their collegiate days. The play was adapted into a television movie starring a then-unknown Meryl Streep.
* In Tayari Jones&#x27;s 2011 novel, &quot;Silver Sparrow&quot;, the two protagonists, Dana and Chaurisse, apply to Mount Holyoke College.

=== Film ===
Several feature films reference Mount Holyoke. Prominent among them are:
*&quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (1987), which is set at a summer resort in the Catskills in the summer of 1963. The protagonist, Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (named after Mount Holyoke graduate Frances Perkins), plans to attend Mount Holyoke in the fall to study the economics of underdeveloped countries and then later to enter the Peace Corps. The film is screened annually for first-year students.
*&quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978), which is set in 1962. It satirizes a common practice up until the mid-1970s when women attending Seven Sister colleges were connected with, or to, students at Ivy League schools. In the film, fraternity brothers from Delta house of the fictional Faber College (based on Dartmouth College) take a road trip to the fictional Emily Dickinson College (Mount Holyoke College).

=== Television ===
An urban legend says that the characters of the hit 1960s cartoon &quot;Scooby Doo Where Are You!&quot; are said to be modeled after the Five College Consortium. Scooby Doo is meant to be University of Massachusetts Amherst, Shaggy is Hampshire, Fred is Amherst, Daphne is Mount Holyoke and Velma is Smith. These characterizations are made under the assumptions of stereotypes of the students from the Five Colleges.

=== Humor ===
* A 1968 article in the Columbia University student newspaper &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; repeated a line from the 1964 movie &quot;Sex and the College Girl&quot;: &quot;Smith to bed, Mount Holyoke to wed&quot;. This referred to the reputation of students from the two Seven Sisters Colleges. In the 1980s, Mount Holyoke students launched a campaign against a dating book and article written by two Princeton graduates that tell men how to pick up female students at women&#x27;s colleges. Under the &quot;Pickup Strategy&quot; category, the article states: &#x27;&quot;Low Key. Recall the Smith saying, &#x27;Holyoke to bed; Smith to wed.&quot;
* The Mount Holyoke song, &quot;We&#x27;re Saving Ourselves For Yale&quot;, alludes to the Ivy League-Seven Sisters relationship, which amusingly relates tales of women who hold onto their virginity long enough to catch a Yale graduate to marry. The song features prominently in Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s &quot;Uncommon Women and Others&quot;.

<text>Mount Holyoke, a traprock mountain, elevation , is the westernmost peak of the Holyoke Range and part of the 100-mile (160 km) Metacomet Ridge. The mountain is located in the Connecticut River Valley of western Massachusetts, and is the namesake of nearby Mount Holyoke College. The mountain is located in the towns of Hadley and South Hadley, Massachusetts. It is known for its historic summit house, auto road, scenic vistas, and biodiversity. The mountain is crossed by the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and numerous shorter trails. Mount Holyoke is the home of J.A. Skinner State Park which is accessible from Route 47 in Hadley, Massachusetts.

==History==
===Origin of name===
The mountain was named after Elizur Holyoke, an early resident of Springfield, Massachusetts and immigrant from Tamworth, England, who was the first European to explore the mountainous region that came to bear his name. The city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, the Holyoke Range, and the &quot;Mount Holyoke Female Seminary&quot; (now Mount Holyoke College) were all named after this mountain, Mount Holyoke, and not directly after Elizur Holyoke. However, Elizur Holyoke&#x27;s name is still invoked in many references to the mountain.

===The Mount Holyoke Summit House===
In 1821, an guest cabin was built on Mount Holyoke by a local committee—one of the first New England summit houses. The property changed hands several times between 1821 and 1851 when it was bought and rebuilt as a two-story, eight-room hotel. Local entrepreneurs John and Frances French were the primary owners; between 1851 and 1900, the hotel and property were subject to a number of upgrades and related construction projects including a covered tramway to the summit of the mountain (first drawn by horse, then mechanized), a railroad from the base of the mountain to a steamboat dock on the Connecticut River, and the construction of a number of outbuildings and trails. With passenger steamship to the connecting summit railway established, the Mount Holyoke &quot;Prospect House&quot; became a popular tourist destination. The steamship would pick up guests at the &quot;Smiths Ferry&quot; railroad station across the Connecticut River in what was then Northampton, ferry them to a tramway leading to the Half Way House. From there guests could take a steep (600 feet long, rising 365 feet) covered inclined tram to the summit (shown in drawing at right). The track for this tram was first laid in 1867 and the system electrified in 1926. Competing establishments were soon built on Mount Tom and Mount Nonotuck across the Connecticut River, and on Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby to the north. The Prospect House property passed hands again in the early 1900s, to chain hotelier Joseph Allen Skinner, who eventually donated the hotel and property to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a state park in 1939 on the condition that the park be named after him (now the J.A. Skinner State Park).

The summit house&#x27;s 1894 annex had suffered from storm damage during the Great Hurricane of 1938 and had been demolished; in 1942 the enclosed tramway to the summit house broke down. A heavy snow storm in 1948 collapsed sections of the roof. Despite proposals to repair the tram it never ran again. The tram was finally demolished in 1965. State funds for maintenance of the summit house during the 1950s and 1960s were never adequate and by the mid-1970s there were proposals to condemn and demolish the summit house. This led to a public outcry and in the mid-1980s the summit house, consisting of the original 1851 structure and the 1861 addition, was restored by the state and through the efforts of local volunteers.

==Geology and ecology==
Mount Holyoke, like much of the Metacomet Ridge, is composed of basalt, also called trap rock, a volcanic rock. The mountain formed near the end of the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the dramatic cliffs and ridges of Mount Holyoke. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Massachusetts. (The Metacomet Ridge article has more information on the geology and ecosystem of Mount Holyoke).

==Recreation==
The summit automobile road is open 
for driving from April through November, and the hiking trails year-round. The Summit House is open weekends and holidays from Memorial Day through Columbus Day. A number of hiking trails also cross the mountain, most notably the 110 mile (180k) Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and the Robert Frost Trail.

Every year in early fall, since 1838, students from nearby Mount Holyoke College participate in &quot;Mountain Day.&quot; On that day, at the sound of ringing bells from Abbey Chapel on a random Autumn morning, all classes are cancelled and students hike to the summit of Mount Holyoke.

The area around the summit house has many picnic tables. Also, there are trailheads and memorials. One notable memorial is that to the men aboard a military plane that crashed into the flank of the mountain. On May 27, 1944, a B-24 Liberator, flying a night training mission out of Westover Air Force Base in Chicopee, Massachusetts, crashed into a cliff on the side of the range, killing all ten crewmen. A memorial plaque on the summit of Mount Holyoke, installed in May 1989, eulogizes the disaster. The crash site itself is away, toward the southwest.

The views from the top of the mountain are some of the best in Massachusetts. They have inspired artists and poets. The nearby Connecticut River Oxbow (now a lake), immortalized by the famous landscape painter Thomas Cole just four years before natural flooding and erosion separated it from the Connecticut River, was composed from sketches the artist made from the summit of Mount Holyoke in 1836. To the south are the cities of Holyoke, Springfield, and Hartford. To the north are the University of Massachusetts in Amherst and mountains in Sunderland. To the east is the Holyoke Range and the town of South Hadley. To the west are the foothills of the Berkshires, the Connecticut River, and Northampton.

==Conservation==
Most of Mount Holyoke is located within the Skinner State Park. The Mount Holyoke Range State Park is a sister park occupying the east side of the Holyoke Range. Its visitor center is located at &quot;the Notch&quot;, where Route 116 crosses the range in Amherst.

In 2000, Mount Holyoke was included in a study by the National Park Service for the designation of a new National Scenic Trail now tentatively called the New England National Scenic Trail, which would include the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail in Massachusetts and the Mattabesett Trail and Metacomet Trail trails in Connecticut.

<text>Robert Edward Czyz ( ; born February 10, 1962) is an American retired boxer and commentator. Czyz was a two-division world titleholder at light heavyweight and cruiserweight.

Czyz was born in Orange, New Jersey. He grew up in Wanaque, New Jersey and attended Lakeland Regional High School. He is three quarters Italian and one quarter Polish. His younger brother is avant-garde fiction writer Vincent Czyz.

Nicknamed &quot;the Matinee Idol&quot;, Czyz was a member of the United States amateur boxing team whose other members died aboard LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007 when it crashed in 1980. Czyz did not make the trip, as he was recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident.

==Amateur career==
As an amateur, Czyz was doing his best to secure his spot at the U.S. Olympic team for the eventually missed 1980 Moscow Olympics. He was one of a few boxers (along with Sal Cenicola, Marvis Frazier and Tony Tucker) who survived the LOT Flight 7 crash by staying at home in the United States. He finished his amateur career having 26 fights under his belt, with a record of 24 wins, 2 losses.

==Professional career==
Czyz had a quick start to his professional boxing career in the early 1980s, and he was soon in line for a shot against world middleweight champion Marvin Hagler. He had to start from scratch, however, after suffering a one-sided, 10-round loss at the hands of veteran Mustafa Hamsho on November 20, 1982 in a bout that was nationally televised.

Czyz went up in weight, put another string of wins together, and in September 1986, he finally found himself in a ring with an undefeated world champion, IBF light heavyweight champion Slobodan Kačar (Olympic Gold medallist of 1980). Czyz beat him in five rounds.

Czyz made three defenses: a one-round defeat of David Sears, a see-saw second-round KO of Willie Edwards, and a fifth-round TKO of Jim McDonald - before taking on &#x27;Prince&#x27; Charles Williams in October 1987. Czyz scored an early knockdown of Williams, yet the challenger not only stayed in the fight, but also hammered shut Czyz&#x27; left eye en route to scoring a TKO victory and thus seizing the title after nine rounds of boxing.

Czyz then lost a decision to Dennis Andries in May 1988, followed by a couple of victories, in turn followed by two cracks at the world title in 1989. Czyz, despite truly good efforts on his part in both challenges, lost both of them - a 12-round decision to Virgil Hill in North Dakota for the WBA version in March, and a 10th-round TKO loss to Williams in an IBF title rematch in June.

Czyz went on to stop then-undefeated Andrew Maynard in seven rounds (the second undefeated Gold medallist he KO&#x27;d) in June 1990, then jumped up to cruiserweight. He challenged Robert Daniels for Daniels&#x27; WBA world cruiserweight championship in March 1991, and won a unanimous decision. Two defenses, against Bash Ali and Donny Lalonde, were made (both by unanimous decision) before Czyz vacated the title.

In 1994, Czyz became a television boxing analyst working alongside Steve Albert and Ferdie Pacheco whilst continuing his boxing career. The trio covered fights in many locations worldwide. In December 1994, he covered the first world title fight ever held in Ecuador as a member of Showtime&#x27;s crew.

In 1996, he stepped up to the heavyweight division, but lost by knockout in five rounds to Evander Holyfield and quickly retired. Czyz fought one last time in 1998, losing by second-round TKO to South African Corrie Sanders. Czyz continued doing color commentary for Showtime, but was let go after pleading guilty to his fourth drunken-driving offense in six years after being caught speeding in Readington Township, New Jersey. Czyz&#x27;s case received a lot of attention as he was a multiple repeat DUI case, and was a driver behind the NJ Assembly revisiting its legislation. Czyz, who was a Raritan Township, New Jersey resident at the time, was given a six-month license suspension for each of his three drunken driving convictions in 1998, 1999 and 2000. It was discovered that he was sentenced improperly as a first-time offender after his fourth arrest, which occurred in February 2003 in Readington Township, where he was caught driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.14 percent. The state limit at that time was 0.10 percent.

==Professional boxing record==

==Outside the ring==
Czyz married actress and photographer Kimberly Ross (October 8, 1959 – December 19, 2006) on October 27, 1992. Their daughter, Mercedes Czyz, was born September 27, 1993. They were divorced by the time Kimberly died, after a long battle with breast cancer, aged 47.

He has since been inducted into the Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.

Czyz is a member of Mensa, the organization for people who have scored in the highest 2% of takers in an IQ test. He even wore a shirt with &quot;MENSA&quot; on it while walking to the ring to fight Evander Holyfield.

<doc id="98531" wikidata="Q128696" url="?curid=98531" title="John Abbott">
<text>Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott (March 12, 1821 – October 30, 1893) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the third prime minister of Canada from 1891 to 1892. He held office as the leader of the Conservative Party.

Abbott was born in what is now Saint-André-d&#x27;Argenteuil, Quebec. He studied law at McGill University and became one of Montreal&#x27;s best-known lawyers, later returning to McGill as a professor of law and earning a Doctor of Civil Law degree. He was perhaps best known for his successful defence of the perpetrators of the St. Albans Raid. Abbott involved himself in politics from a young age, signing the Montreal Annexation Manifesto in 1849which he later regrettedand winning election to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1860. In the lead-up to Confederation he was a prominent advocate for the rights of English-speaking Quebecers.

In the 1867 federal election, Abbott was elected to the new House of Commons of Canada as a member of the Conservative Party. A telegram leaked from his office played a key part in the Pacific Scandal of 1873, which led to the downfall of John A. Macdonald&#x27;s first government. Abbott was appointed to the Senate in 1887, in order to become leader of the Government in the Senate. He became prime minister in June 1891 following Macdonald&#x27;s death in office. He was the first native-born Canadian prime minister, both Macdonald and Alexander Mackenzie having been born in Scotland. Abbott was 70 years old at the time, and served only until November 1892 when he retired due to ill health. He died the following year.

== Early life ==
Abbott was born in St. Andrews, Lower Canada (now Saint-André-d&#x27;Argenteuil, Quebec), to Harriet (née Bradford) and the Rev. Joseph Abbott, an Anglican missionary from Little Strickland, England. In 1849, Abbott married Mary Martha Bethune (1823–1898), a relative of Dr. Norman Bethune, a daughter of Anglican clergyman and McGill acting president John Bethune, and a granddaughter of the Presbyterian minister John Bethune. The couple had four sons and four daughters, many of whom died without descendants. Their eldest surviving son, William Abbott, married the daughter of Colonel John Hamilton Gray, a Father of Confederation and premier of Prince Edward Island. Abbott was also the great-grandfather of Canadian actor Christopher Plummer and the first cousin (once removed) of Maude Abbott, one of Canada&#x27;s earliest female medical graduates and an expert on congenital heart disease.

Abbott was an Orangeman and Freemason.

===Military service===

Abbott had served in the local militia “since boyhood”, being appointed an Ensign in the 2nd Montreal Militia Battalion in 1847. In 1849 he was a signatory to the Montreal Annexation Manifesto, calling for union of the Canadas with the United States, resulting in the withdrawal of his commission in the militia. By 1850 however, he was reinstated and appointed a Captain in the 4th Montreal Militia Battalion.

His recruitment of a battalion of 300 men, known as the 11th Argenteuil Rangers, during the Trent Affair of 1861 may have been designed to atone for what he later described as the “sins of youth” and to enhance his political credentials, as much as to express his concern for his country&#x27;s safety. On March 14, 1862, he was appointed Major in the 11th (Argenteuil Rifles) Volunteer Militia, being promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel on March 21.

He commanded the regiment on the border multiple times throughout the Fenian Raids, on March 8, 1866, they were called out for active service and were stationed in various villages throughout Argenteuil. On June 11, 1866, the Rangers were called out to serve at Cornwall, and then Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and a reporter from Montreal stated: 
Abbott retired from the militia as a Lieutenant Colonel, commanding the 11th Battalion, on June 22, 1883.

Taunted by his political opponents in March 1889 for his “disloyalty” in 1849, he explained that he considered his military service, and his commission as an officer and later commanding officer of the 11th Argenteuil Battalion of militia, to be evidence that his youthful error had been forgiven.

==Legal career==
Abbott graduated as a Bachelor of Civil Law from McGill College (now McGill University) in Montreal in 1847, and in the same year was initiated in the St. Paul&#x27;s Masonic Lodge, No. 374, E.R., in Montreal. In 1867, he graduated as a Doctor of Civil Law (DCL). Most of his legal practice was in corporate law; however, his most celebrated court case was the defence of at first fourteen, then upon release and recapture, four of those fourteen Confederate agents who had raided St. Albans, Vermont, from Canadian soil during the American Civil War. Abbott successfully argued that the Confederates were belligerents rather than criminals and therefore should not be extradited. He began lecturing in commercial and criminal law at McGill in 1853, and in 1855 he became a professor and dean of its Faculty of Law, where Wilfrid Laurier, a future prime minister of Canada, was among his students. He continued in this position until 1880. In 1862, he was made Queen&#x27;s Counsel. Upon his retirement, McGill named him emeritus professor, and in 1881 appointed him to its Board of Governors.

==Politics==
===Early involvement===
In 1849, he signed the Montreal Annexation Manifesto calling for Canada to join the United States, an action which he regretted later as a youthful error. He eventually joined the Loyal Orange Lodge of British North America, well known as a pro-British organization. Abbott first ran for Canada&#x27;s Legislative Assembly in 1857 in the Argenteuil district, northwest of Montreal. Defeated, he challenged the election results on the grounds of voting list irregularities and was eventually awarded the seat in 1860. He served as solicitor general for Lower Canada (Quebec) representing the liberal administration of John Sandfield Macdonald and Louis Sicotte, from 1862 until 1863. He reluctantly supported Canada&#x27;s confederation, fearing the reduction of the political power of Lower Canada&#x27;s English-speaking minority. In 1865, he converted to a conservative. His proposal to protect the electoral borders of 12 English Quebec constituencies was eventually incorporated into the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;.

===National politics===
Abbott was elected to the House of Commons in 1867 as member for Argenteuil. He was removed from his seat by petition in 1874 following his involvement in the Pacific Scandal. He narrowly lost the 1878 election, then won in February 1880, only to have his victory declared void because of bribery allegations. He was, however, subsequently elected in a by-election in August 1881. In 1887, Macdonald appointed him to the Senate. He served as Leader of the Government in the Senate from May 12, 1887, to October 30, 1893 (including his term as prime minister) and as Minister without Portfolio in Macdonald&#x27;s cabinet. He also served two one-year terms as mayor of Montreal from 1887 to 1889.
Abbott was involved in the promotion of several railway projects, including the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) (of which he served as president). He worked to incorporate and arrange financing for the first CPR syndicate. As legal advisor to its main financier, Sir Hugh Allan, Abbott was the recipient of the infamous telegram from Prime Minister Macdonald during the 1872 Canadian federal election campaign which read &quot;I must have another ten thousand; will be the last time of calling; do not fail me; answer today.&quot; This telegram was stolen from Abbott&#x27;s office and published, breaking the 1873 Pacific Scandal which brought down Macdonald&#x27;s government. Abbott was subsequently a key organizer of a second syndicate which eventually completed the construction of Canada&#x27;s first transcontinental railway in 1885, serving as its solicitor from 1880 to 1887 and as a director from 1885 to 1891.

===Prime minister===

When Prime Minister Macdonald died in office, Abbott supported John Thompson to succeed him, but reluctantly accepted the plea of the divided Conservative party that he should lead the government, though he considered himself a caretaker prime minister for his seventeen months in office. He was one of just two Canadian Prime Ministers, the other being Mackenzie Bowell, to have held the office while serving in the Senate rather than the House of Commons.

Soon after Abbott assumed office in 1891, Canada was plunged into an economic recession; later that same year he faced another challenge as the McGreevy-Langevin scandal came to light, revealing that Hector-Louis Langevin, former Minister of Public Works in the Conservative government, had conspired with contractor Thomas McGreevy to defraud the government.

Despite the political toll on his party, Abbott dealt with the backlog of government business awaiting him after Macdonald&#x27;s death, including reform of the civil service and revisions of the criminal code. He attempted in 1892 to negotiate a new treaty of reciprocity with the United States, but failed to reach an agreement.

During his term, there were 52 by-elections, 42 of which were won by the Conservatives, increasing their majority by 13 seats—evidence of Abbott&#x27;s effectiveness as prime minister. One year into his time as prime minister, Abbott attempted to turn the office over to Thompson, but this was rejected due to anti-Catholic sentiment in the Tory caucus.

==Later life==

Suffering from the early stages of cancer of the brain, Abbott&#x27;s health failed in 1892 and he retired to private life, whereupon Sir John Thompson finally became prime minister. Abbott died less than a year later at the age of 72.

Sir John Abbott is buried in the Mount Royal Cemetery, Montreal, Quebec.

==Legacy==

John Abbott College in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, near Abbott&#x27;s country estate (Boisbriant), is named after him.

He was named a Person of National Historic Significance by the Government of Canada in 1938.

His &quot;most memorable&quot; political comment is &quot;I hate politics.&quot; The full quote was &quot;I hate politics and what are considered their appropriate measures. I hate notoriety, public meetings, public speeches, caucuses and everything that I know of which is apparently the necessary incident of politics—except doing public work to the best of my ability.&quot;

In their 1999 look at the Canadian prime ministers through Jean Chrétien, J.L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer included a survey of Canadian historians ranking the prime ministers. Abbott&#x27;s term of service was considered below par and was ranked #17 out of 20 (up to then). When the survey was repeated in 2016, Abbott was ranked 7th out of ten &quot;short-term&quot; prime ministers with a score of 1.8 out of 5.

<doc id="98532" wikidata="Q1021026" url="?curid=98532" title="Rocky Mount, North Carolina">
<text>Rocky Mount is a city in Nash and Edgecombe counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The city&#x27;s population was 54,341 as of the 2020 census, making it the 20th-most populous city in North Carolina. The city is east of Raleigh, the state capital.

It is the principal city of the Rocky Mount metropolitan area—often called the &quot;Twin Counties&quot;—which had an estimated population of 145,383 in 2023. Rocky Mount is also an anchor city of the Rocky Mount-Wilson-Roanoke Rapids, NC Combined Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 288,366 in 2023.

English and Scots traders encountered the indigenous people in this area of the falls of the Tar River beginning in the mid-1700s. Incorporated in 1867, the community continued to develop through the 19th century based on agriculture (cotton and tobacco), manufacturing of textiles (made possible by the water power of the falls), and development of rail transportation to link the town to major markets. 

Since the late 20th century, the economy of Rocky Mount has diversified into biomedical pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and logistics. Rocky Mount has twice received the All-America City Award from the National Civic League: in 1969 and 1999.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The region around the Tar River was continuously inhabited by various cultures of indigenous people for 12,000 years. It had long been home to the historic Tuscarora people, who spoke an Iroquoian language. After English colonists and indigenous allies waged the Tuscarora War in the early 1700s; most survivors migrated to the North. The main party of the Tuscarora settled by 1722 with other Iroquoian peoples of the Five Nations, south of the Great Lakes in what became central and western New York. They became the Sixth Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy.

More English speakers began to settle the area along the Tar River. They settled along the fall line between the Piedmont and coastal plain, below which the rivers were navigable to the coast. The difference in height meant that the downstream waters could power mills.

The Falls of the Tar River Primitive Baptist Church was established in 1757. As the church was the center of community life, its records were the first civil and vital records of the developing village. Its congregation effectively administered law enforcement, with officers issuing citations for crimes.

===19th century===
A post office was established at the falls of the Tar River on March 22, 1816. At this point, the name &quot;Rocky Mount&quot; officially appears in documented history, referring to the rocky mound at the falls of the Tar River. Rocky Mount Mills, the second cotton mill in the state of North Carolina, was built there soon after in 1818. Its proprietors were two entrepreneurs and Joel Battle, grandson of an original colonial settler here. Battle bought out the other proprietors before turning over the enterprise to his cousin James Smith Battle. Until the 1850s, the mill operated with the labor of enslaved African Americans. They also comprised most of the labor on the cotton plantations.

Beginning then, the mill owners hired exclusively white women and girls as mill workers for the rest of the century.

The Battle family was also involved in the construction of the longest continuous railroad in the world up to that time, the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, which ran about east of the mill. It connected the area to major ports in Virginia to the north and the port of Wilmington, North Carolina to the south. The tracks first reached Rocky Mount on Christmas Eve in 1839. In 1840, a train of cars en route to Wilmington stopped in Rocky Mount to import some &quot;Old Nash&quot; for special toasts at opening festivities. The fame of Nash County apple brandy spread from there.

The railroad stimulated development of the town. In 1871, the county line was moved from the Tar River to its present location in the center of the tracks. The Raleigh-Tarboro stage route also passed just south of Rocky Mount (roughly where I-95 and U.S. 64 run today), and for a time was the logical debarking point for railroad travelers wishing to proceed east or west.

During the Civil War, the surrounding region was raided in 1863 by Union troops under the command of Brigadier General Edward E. Potter. They burned down the mill, which supplied Confederate yarn and cloth. After the war ended, the owners rebuilt the mill. On February 19, 1867, the village outside the mill, which was largely devoted to worker housing, was incorporated as a town.

In the latter half of the 19th century, the tobacco industry became established in the state. Adjacent to the sandy coastal plain, Rocky Mount was well situated to take advantage of the rapidly rising demand for brightleaf tobacco that grew best in the sandy soil. Tobacco also shaped the city&#x27;s social life. Warehouses where tobacco was stored and marketed began hosting balls for the community in the 1880s; these became known as &quot;june germans&quot; for the time of year and style of dance. June Germans eventually transformed into all-night dance parties and attracted musicians and socialites from miles around well into the 1900s. By the end of the 19th century, tobacco had surpassed King Cotton as the town&#x27;s primary agricultural product.

===20th century===
At the turn of the 20th century, Rocky Mount became the northern headquarters of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, which located its major repair shops and yard facilities in the town. With it came an influx of railroad workers. In 1900, Rocky Mount&#x27;s population was around 3,000.

On February 28, 1907, with a population around 7,500, Rocky Mount was officially incorporated as a city. A main railroad line, a well-established cotton mill, and productive farmland for brightleaf tobacco were major contributors to the area&#x27;s growth and prosperity over the next decades. A vibrant central business district arose.

As in the rest of the South, North Carolina had imposed legal racial segregation, including restrictions and discrimination in housing. White suburbs developed largely on the west side of town, such as Villa Place and West Haven. Black neighborhoods, such as Crosstown and Around the &quot;Y&quot;, where jazz musician Thelonious Monk was born, were concentrated on the east side of town.

Several notable Civil Rights events occurred in Rocky Mount. In 1946, African-American tobacco warehouse workers voted to organize in Rocky Mount as part of a broader nationwide movement known as Operation Dixie. It included voter registration to fight against the disenfranchisement of blacks and to take other political action against segregation. On November 27, 1962, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech at Booker T. Washington High School; he used his refrain &quot;I have a dream&quot; a year before his better known delivery at the March on Washington, which became famous. 

Sanitation workers went on strike in 1978 when government sanitation workers protested their black co-worker being wrongfully arrested. He was acquitted in court on the charges. In 2018 the city council officially apologized to him for the case.
After WWII, the city continued to grow. In the 1950s and 1960s the city&#x27;s economy diversified to include banking, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and the headquarters of a fast food chain known as Hardee&#x27;s.

New higher education facilities were founded, including North Carolina Wesleyan College in 1956 and Nash Community College and Edgecombe Community College in 1968. In 1970, Rocky Mount received an All-America City Award. In the 1970s the city&#x27;s hospitals were consolidated under Nash General Hospital. That was also the period of completion of Rocky Mount–Wilson Regional Airport.

From the 1980s, the inner city suffered urban decay, as businesses had moved out to suburban highway locations. Rocky Mount&#x27;s downtown deteriorated as new neighborhoods and shopping malls were built, such as Golden East Crossing. The city expanded its boundaries by annexation; for instance, in 1996, annexing the town of Battleboro to the north of the city. In 1999, the city won its second All-America City Award.

In the fall of 1999 two hurricanes made landfall in eastern North Carolina. Both passed over Rocky Mount: Hurricane Dennis as a tropical storm in August with of rain and Hurricane Floyd in September with nearly of rain. Floyd is especially memorable because most localized flooding happened quickly overnight. Many residents were not aware of the flooding until the water came into their homes, and many required rescue. The hurricane resulted in the worst flooding in history of the Tar River, which had become saturated in August. It exceeded 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches, and many homes and businesses were destroyed.

===21st century===
During the first decades of the 21st century, the city has encouraged efforts to revitalize the historic downtown. It has supported projects to renovate buildings such as the train station and Douglas Block, or repurpose them, such as the Imperial Centre for Arts and Sciences.

In 2007, Capitol Broadcasting Company bought Rocky Mount Mills. It is adapting it as a mixed-use campus of breweries, restaurants, residential lofts, and event space. Major new community projects include the sports complex and downtown event center. In 2019, CSX, the successor company of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, broke ground on a new intermodal cargo terminal that is expected to stimulate the local economy in the next decade.

===Neighborhoods===
====Historic Rocky Mount Mills Village====

Situated near the Tar River, the Rocky Mount Mills Village grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a small community of tenants working for the mill. Built between 1885 and 1940, each house in the historic district is recognized by the National Register of Historic Places. 

Changes in industrialization eventually forced the closing of the mill. The workers had to find other housing. However, when the mill closed, the property remained intact. Though the property has been a rental for its entire existence, covenants are placed on the property to assure home ownership and owner occupancy and protect the historical integrity.

<text>Asphyxia or asphyxiation is a condition of deficient supply of oxygen to the body which arises from abnormal breathing. Asphyxia causes generalized hypoxia, which affects all the tissues and organs, some more rapidly than others. There are many circumstances that can induce asphyxia, all of which are characterized by the inability of a person to acquire sufficient oxygen through breathing for an extended period of time. Asphyxia can cause coma or death.
In 2015, about 9.8 million cases of unintentional suffocation occurred which resulted in 35,600 deaths. The word asphyxia is from Ancient Greek &quot;without&quot; and , &quot;squeeze&quot; (throb of heart).

==Causes==
Situations that can cause asphyxia include but are not limited to: airway obstruction, the constriction or obstruction of airways, such as from asthma, laryngospasm, or simple blockage from the presence of foreign materials; from being in environments where oxygen is not readily accessible: such as underwater, in a low oxygen atmosphere, or in a vacuum; environments where sufficiently oxygenated air is present, but cannot be adequately breathed because of air contamination such as excessive smoke.

Other causes of oxygen deficiency include 
but are not limited to:
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Alcohol poisoning
* Carbon monoxide inhalation, such as that from a car exhaust and the smoke produced by a lit cigarette: carbon monoxide has a higher affinity than oxygen to the hemoglobin in the blood&#x27;s red blood corpuscles, bonding with it tenaciously, and, in the process, displacing oxygen and preventing the blood from transporting oxygen around the body
* Contact with certain chemicals, including pulmonary agents (such as phosgene) and blood agents (such as hydrogen cyanide)
* Choking by obstruction of a foreign body in the airway (for example: when eating)
* Cyanide poisoning
* Drowning
* Drug overdose
* Exposure to extreme low pressure or vacuum from spacesuit damage (see space exposure)
* Hanging, whether suspension or short drop hanging
* Self-induced hypocapnia by hyperventilation, as in shallow water or deep water blackout and the choking game
* Inert gas asphyxiation
* Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, or primary alveolar hypoventilation, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system in which a patient must consciously breathe; although it is often said that people with this disease will die if they fall asleep, this is not usually the case.
* Respiratory diseases
* Sleep apnea
* A seizure which stops breathing activity
* An allergic reaction
* Strangling
* Breaking the wind pipe
* Prolonged exposure to chlorine gas

===Smothering===

Smothering is a mechanical obstruction of the flow of air from the environment into the mouth or nostrils, for instance, by covering the mouth and nose with a hand, pillow, or a plastic bag. Smothering can be either partial or complete, where partial indicates that the person being smothered is able to inhale some air, although less than required. In a normal situation, smothering requires at least partial obstruction of both the nasal cavities and the mouth to lead to asphyxia. Smothering with the hands or chest is used in some combat sports to distract the opponent, and create openings for transitions, as the opponent is forced to react to the smothering.

In some cases, when performing certain routines, smothering is combined with simultaneous compressive asphyxia. One example is overlay, in which an adult accidentally rolls over onto an infant during co-sleeping, an accident that often goes unnoticed and is mistakenly thought to be sudden infant death syndrome. 

Other accidents involving a similar mechanism are cave-ins, or when an individual is buried in sand, snow, dirt, or grain.

In homicidal cases, the term burking describes a killing method that involves simultaneous smothering and compression of the torso. The term &quot;burking&quot; comes from the method William Burke and William Hare used to kill their victims during the West Port murders. They killed the usually intoxicated victims by sitting on their chests and suffocating them by putting a hand over their nose and mouth, while using the other hand to push the victim&#x27;s jaw up. The corpses had no visible injuries, and were supplied to medical schools for money.

===Compressive asphyxia===

Compressive asphyxia (also called chest compression) is mechanically limiting expansion of the lungs by compressing the torso, preventing breathing. &quot;Traumatic asphyxia&quot; or &quot;crush asphyxia&quot; usually refers to compressive asphyxia resulting from being crushed or pinned under a large weight or force, or in a crowd crush. An example of traumatic asphyxia is a person who jacks up a car to work on it from below, and is crushed by the vehicle when the jack fails. Constrictor snakes such as boa constrictors kill through slow compressive asphyxia, tightening their coils every time the prey breathes out rather than squeezing forcefully. In cases of an adult co-sleeping with an infant (&quot;overlay&quot;), the heavy sleeping adult may move on top of the infant, causing compression asphyxia.

In fatal crowd disasters, compressive asphyxia from being crushed against the crowd causes all or nearly all deaths, rather than blunt trauma from trampling. This is what occurred at the Ibrox disaster in 1971, where 66 Rangers fans died; the 1979 The Who concert disaster where 11 died; the Luzhniki disaster in 1982, when 66 FC Spartak Moscow fans died; the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool fans were crushed to death in an overcrowded terrace, 95 of the 97 from compressive asphyxia, 93 dying directly from it and 3 others from related complications; the 2021 Meron crowd crush where 45 died; the Astroworld Festival crowd crush in 2021, where 10 died; and the Seoul Halloween crowd crush in 2022, where at least 159 died during Halloween celebrations.

In confined spaces, people are forced to push against each other; evidence from bent steel railings in several fatal crowd accidents has shown horizontal forces over 4500 N (equivalent to a weight of approximately 450 kg or 1000 lbs). In cases where people have stacked up on each other in a human pile, it has been estimated that those at the bottom are subjected to around 380 kg (840 lbs) of compressive weight.

&quot;Positional&quot; or &quot;restraint&quot; asphyxia is when a person is restrained and left alone prone, such as in a police vehicle, and is unable to reposition themself in order to breathe. The death can be in the vehicle, or following loss of consciousness to be followed by death while in a coma, having presented with anoxic brain damage. The asphyxia can be caused by facial compression, neck compression, or chest compression. This occurs mostly during restraint and handcuffing situations by law enforcement, including psychiatric incidents. The weight of the restraint(s) doing the compression may contribute to what is attributed to positional asphyxia. Therefore, passive deaths following custody restraint that are presumed to be the result of positional asphyxia may actually be examples of asphyxia occurring during the restraint process.

Chest compression is a technique used in various grappling combat sports, where it is sometimes called wringing, either to tire the opponent or as complementary or distractive moves in combination with pinning holds, or sometimes even as submission holds. Examples of chest compression include the knee-on-stomach position; or techniques such as leg scissors (also referred to as body scissors and in budō referred to as &quot;do-jime&quot;; 胴絞, &quot;trunk strangle&quot; or &quot;body triangle&quot;) where a participant wraps his or her legs around the opponent&#x27;s midsection and squeezes them together.

Pressing is a form of torture or execution using compressive asphyxia.

===Perinatal asphyxia===
Perinatal asphyxia is the medical condition resulting from deprivation of oxygen (hypoxia) to a newborn infant long enough to cause apparent harm. It results most commonly from a drop in maternal blood pressure or interference during delivery with blood flow to the infant&#x27;s brain. This can occur as a result of inadequate circulation or perfusion, impaired respiratory effort, or inadequate ventilation. There has long been a scientific debate over whether newborn infants with asphyxia should be resuscitated with 100% oxygen or normal air. It has been demonstrated that high concentrations of oxygen lead to generation of oxygen free radicals, which have a role in reperfusion injury after asphyxia. Research by Ola Didrik Saugstad and others led to new international guidelines on newborn resuscitation in 2010, recommending the use of normal air instead of 100% oxygen.

=== Mechanical asphyxia ===

Classifications of different forms of asphyxia vary among literature, with differences in defining the concept of mechanical asphyxia being the most obvious.

In DiMaio and DiMaio&#x27;s 2001 textbook on forensic pathology, mechanical asphyxia is caused by pressure from outside the body restricting respiration. Similar narrow definitions of mechanical asphyxia have occurred in Azmak&#x27;s 2006 literature review of asphyxial deaths and Oehmichen and Auer&#x27;s 2005 book on forensic neuropathology. According to DiMaio and DiMaio, mechanical asphyxia encompasses positional asphyxia, traumatic asphyxia, and &quot;human pile&quot; deaths.

In Shkrum and Ramsay&#x27;s 2007 textbook on forensic pathology, mechanical asphyxia occurs when any mechanical means cause interference with the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body. Similar broad definitions of mechanical asphyxia have occurred in Saukko and Knight&#x27;s 2004 book on asphyxia, and Dolinak and Matshes&#x27; 2005 book on forensic pathology. According to Shkrum and Ramsay, mechanical asphyxia encompasses smothering, choking, positional asphyxia, traumatic asphyxia, wedging, strangulation and drowning.

Sauvageau and Boghossian propose in 2010 that mechanical asphyxia should be officially defined as caused by &quot;restriction of respiratory movements, either by the position of the body or by external chest compression&quot;, thus encompassing only positional asphyxia and traumatic asphyxia.

== First aid ==
If there are symptoms of mechanical asphyxia, it is necessary to call the Emergency Medical Services. In some countries, such as the US, there may also be self-acting groups of voluntary first responders who have been trained in first aid. In case of mechanical asphyxia, first aid can be provided on your own.

=== First aid for choking on food ===

In case of choking on a foreign body:

* Stand behind the affected person and wrap your arms around him/her.
* Push inwards and upwards under the ribs with a sudden movement by your second hand.
* If the performed actions were not effective, repeat them until you free respiratory tract of the affected person from a foreign body.

<doc id="98535" wikidata="Q634923" url="?curid=98535" title="Shotgun formation">
<text>The shotgun formation is a formation used by the offensive team in gridiron football mainly for passing plays, although some teams use it as their base formation. Instead of the quarterback receiving the snap from center at the line of scrimmage, in the shotgun he stands further back, often five to seven yards off the line. Sometimes the quarterback will have a back on one or both sides before the snap, while other times he will be the lone player in the backfield with everyone spread out as receivers. 

The shotgun formation can offer certain advantages. The offensive linemen have more room to maneuver behind the scrimmage line and form a tighter, more cohesive oval “pocket” in which the quarterback is protected from “blitzing” by the defense. The quarterback also has a better view of the defense from the shotgun formation. If the quarterback has speed, mobility or both, he can use this formation to scramble before his pass, or to run to an open field position in the defensive secondary or to the sideline, usually gaining first-down yardage. 

Although some running plays can be run effectively from the shotgun, the formation also has weaknesses. The defense knows a pass is more than likely coming, particularly from an empty set lacking any running backs, and there is a higher risk of a botched snap than in a simple center/quarterback exchange. If the defense is planning a pass rush, this formation gives fast defensive players more open and exposed targets in the offensive backfield, with less cluttered “blitzing” routes to the quarterback and any other halfback in the offensive backfield.

Shotgun combines elements of the short punt and spread formations — &quot;spread&quot; in that it has receivers spread widely instead of close to or behind the interior line players. The origins of the term are thought to be that it is like a &quot;shotgun&quot; in spraying receivers around the field. (The alignment of the players also suggests the shape of an actual shotgun.) Formations similar or identical to the shotgun used decades previously would be called names such as &quot;spread double wing&quot;. Short punt formations (so called because the distance between the snapper and the ostensible punter is shorter than in long punt formation) do not usually have as much emphasis on wide receivers. 

==History==
The shotgun evolved from the single wing and the similar double-wing spread; famed triple threat man Sammy Baugh has claimed that the shotgun was effectively the same as the version of the double-wing he ran at Texas Christian University in the 1930s.

The formation was named by San Francisco 49ers head coach Red Hickey, who systematized the modern shotgun offense in 1960. John Brodie was the first National Football League shotgun quarterback, beating out former starter Y. A. Tittle largely because he was mobile enough to effectively run the formation. 

The New York Jets briefly experimented with the shotgun during the middle of the Joe Namath era to give the bad-kneed and often immobile quarterback more time to set up plays by placing him deeper in the backfield. Three years before Dallas ushered in the modern era of the shotgun to the NFL, Joe Theismann of the Toronto Argonauts regularly employed the formation north of the border in the Canadian Football League. However, the formation was not used on a regular basis in the NFL until the season, and then only by the Dallas Cowboys, who used the shotgun frequently with Roger Staubach at quarterback. The Cowboy shotgun differed from the 49er shotgun as Staubach generally had a back next to him in the backfield (making runs possible), where Brodie was normally alone in the backfield. 

Since no other NFL teams used the formation during this time, some believed it had been invented by head coach Tom Landry. Instead, Landry simply dusted off the old innovation to address a pressing problem: keeping Staubach protected while an unusually young and inexperienced squad (12 rookies made the 1975 Cowboys roster) jelled. Dallas ended up in the Super Bowl that season, in no small part due to its new use of the old formation. The shotgun became a &quot;signature&quot; formation for the Cowboys, especially during third down situations.

The shotgun was adopted by more teams throughout the pass-happy late 1980s, and was part of almost every team&#x27;s offense in the 1990s, eventually becoming a base formation for some teams in the late 2000s.

==Recent use==

In recent years, the shotgun has become vastly prevalent. Many college quarterbacks—such as Tim Tebow, who almost exclusively used the shotgun at Florida—have difficulty adapting to NFL offenses where about a third of snaps are taken under center. However, with the spread offense increasingly used in the NFL, the shotgun is more popular, since the spread allows for more effective running.

The shotgun formation is often run during 2nd-and-long or 3rd-and-long situations to give the quarterback enough time to allow the receivers to run deep routes. However, Peyton Manning, formerly of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos, often audibled to plays that use this formation in order to better read defenses and to take advantage of fast receivers like Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne and gain extended yardage in a single play. In 2007, the New England Patriots used the shotgun with great effectiveness as a base formation for the offense that scored the then-record 587 points in a 16-game season (since broken by the Denver Broncos in 2013); in fact, the 2007 Patriots were the first team in NFL history to use it for the majority of their offensive plays. The Patriots have also used the formation to directly snap the ball away from the quarterback, snapping it instead to a running back (usually Kevin Faulk); the Patriots scored a two-point conversion via such a direct snap to Faulk in Super Bowl XXXVIII and again against the Chargers in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.

Though the shotgun is a pass-dominated formation, a cleverly designed halfback draw play can put defenses off guard and a fast halfback can get good yardage before the defense recovers from their mistake. A further development of the play is a halfback option pass, with the quarterback being one of the eligible receivers. Roger Staubach&#x27;s backup and successor, Danny White, twice caught such a pass for a touchdown. It was noted at the time that he was only eligible because of the shotgun formation (an NFL quarterback who takes a snap from underneath the center was and still is an ineligible receiver, a rule not found in any amateur level of American football). 

The shotgun is also used in college, but running is used more often than in the NFL. Most offenses in college who run in the shotgun have a fast quarterback. They often use a play where the quarterback has an option of handing the ball off to the running back who runs to the side opposite the side he was lined up on. The quarterback can also run the opposite way depending on how the defense reacts. Urban Meyer and the Florida Gators used this effectively from 2006 to 2009 with Tim Tebow.

==Related formations==

The Nevada Wolf Pack under coach Chris Ault employed a formation called the &quot;pistol&quot;, in which the running back, instead of lining up next to the quarterback, lines up behind the quarterback, who in turn has lined up two to three yards behind the center.

Coach Urban Meyer has added elements of the option offense to the shotgun offense he employed as coach at Bowling Green State University, the University of Utah, and University of Florida. This &quot;spread option&quot; offense is also used by the Missouri Tigers, Ohio State Buckeyes and other college teams with quarterbacks who can run as well as throw effectively.

==Use in Canadian football==

At times the formation has been more common in Canadian football, which allows only three downs to move ten yards downfield instead of the American game&#x27;s four. Canadian teams are therefore more likely to find themselves with long yardage to make on the penultimate down, and therefore more likely to line up in the shotgun to increase their opportunities for a large gain. Canadian teams also have the advantage that backs positioned behind the line of scrimmage can run forward and cross the line running as the ball is snapped.

<text>Allen Leonard McCoy (April 26, 1933 – September 21, 2024) was an American sportscaster who was the play-by-play announcer for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association from 1972 to 2023. The 2022–23 NBA season was his 51st and final season. He is the longest-tenured broadcaster in NBA history.

Along with Chick Hearn, Hot Rod Hundley and Kevin Calabro, he was among the last of NBA broadcasters to have been simulcast on both television and radio, before league-officials ended the practice in the mid-2000&#x27;s and McCoy&#x27;s broadcasts became exclusive to radio and online streaming via the Suns Radio Network.

His fast-paced, classical broadcasting style coupled with his colorful use of catchphrase to distinguish plays has proven influential to a generation of sportscasters, such as lead NBA on ABC play-by-play announcer Mike Breen, who remarked of McCoy as &quot;one of my heroes&quot; during live ESPN coverage of the 2021 Western Conference Finals. Steve Albert said &quot;I put him up there with Vin Scully and Ernie Harwell, and all the greats, all the legends.&quot;

McCoy is a Curt Gowdy Media Award winner and a member of the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor. Despite these accolades, The Arizona Republic would later detail the circumstances leading to his forced displacement to the back of the Suns arena upon his final season, after 50 previous seasons on the floor next to the Suns players&#x27; bench in a courtside spot once-named &quot;the best seat in the house&quot; in his own Ring of Honor speech. The Arizona Republic also published a photo gallery showing 90-year-old Al McCoy walking up the long flights of concrete steps to the higher arena location Suns personnel moved him to finish his career.

==Early life==
McCoy was born on April 26, 1933, Williams, Iowa. He grew up on a farm outside the area with no electricity or running water throughout his early childhood. To entertain himself as a boy on the farm, he would often read comic books or listen to his family&#x27;s battery-powered radio.

At an early age, he became enamored with both the local and nationally-syndicated sportscasts picked up through the area&#x27;s AM radio frequencies. The sounds of golden-age broadcasters like Bert Wilson, Don Dunphy, Bill Stern, along with Pat Flanagan, Jack Brickhouse and Harry Caray, would propel his childhood imagination, provide future inspiration and fuel a lifelong passion for sports and broadcasting. As a growing boy, he would sometimes prop himself on the farm&#x27;s fence posts and broadcast fantasy play-by-play for a crowd of the family&#x27;s pigs and cattle, imagining himself at Chicago Stadium, Madison Square Garden or famed Boston Garden.

In 1945, he attended the World Series between the Chicago Cubs and Detroit Tigers. In the fall of 1948, he attended his first National Basketball Association (then-known as the National Basketball League) game as the Waterloo Hawks hosted league-MVP Don Otten&#x27;s Tri-Cities Black Hawks, and would soon witness George Mikan play in-person during another game in Waterloo. He continued to scan the radio dial every night to hear the Joe Louis big boxing fights of the era, Cubs broadcasts, national football, basketball, or any and every other sport he could get tuned through his receiver. Concurrently, as an active youth with a basketball hoop now-propped up in a tree on the farm, he made the starting line-up of his high-school basketball team for three seasons, playing the position of point-guard. His high school Coach Chuck Lovin remembered McCoy as a &quot;good shot&quot; who was &quot;intense&quot; about everything he did in high school, from athletics to school plays.

Around the same span of time, at the age of 14, he began playing jazz piano in a variety of local and touring small-piece and big bands at local area dances in the midwest-territory for extra income, a side-gig he would continue throughout college that would routinely have him home by 2.a.m. for 7 a.m. classes. One memorable night, he played as a sideman to famed jazz trumpeter Roy Eldridge, who remembered and recognized him immediately upon their second meeting many years later, as McCoy attended a concert alongside Al Bianchi &amp; John MacLeod following a Phoenix Suns game.

===Education and early career===

He attended Drake University, majoring in Drama-Speech and minoring in Broadcast Journalism.

Drake University did not formally offer a radio or broadcast major at the time, so McCoy signed up for as many radio classes as he could. During his first year of classes he begged his professor, the head of the radio department and Drake Relays announcer Jim Duncan to let him borrow a university tape recorder so he could demo his play-by-play during a campus basketball game. Assuring McCoy it could wait until his junior or senior year, Professor Duncan relented after weeks of McCoy&#x27;s ongoing persistence. Dropping his recording off early the next morning and eager for his professor&#x27;s critique, he waited another couple weeks until finally being called into Duncan&#x27;s office, who now demanded to know how long McCoy had been calling basketball games. Impressed by the level of detail in his first play-by-play recording, Duncan became McCoy&#x27;s early supporter and mentor from that date forward.

Also during his freshman year his first job in radio was at KJFJ in Webster City, Iowa, and he was soon hired by WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, working the night shift where was subsequently told by the person who hired him that he did not have a future in broadcasting, demoted from &quot;on-air&quot; talent and moved to production staff. 

Shaken by the experience, but undeterred from following his childhood dreams, McCoy left WHO for smaller family-run station KWDM to strengthen his play-by-play for a variety of different sports. Amidst transition, he first encountered Chick Hearn, then-broadcaster for Bradley University, at a Bradley-Drake basketball game. The two would remain friends until Hearn&#x27;s death in 2002, buying each other dinner when either were in Phoenix or Los Angeles for their future respective NBA teams, often reminiscing on their early days broadcasting in the midwest. McCoy would later credit Hearn along with Marty Glickman as “blazing the trial” for basketball broadcasters in his Naismith Hall of Fame speech.

In 1954 McCoy graduated from Drake. Testing his luck out west where some of his relatives had relocated, he spent a summer looking for radio work in Phoenix, Arizona and later Denver, Colorado. In both locations he found could not even land a single job interview and played piano to support himself, before applying for a graduate assistantship at the University of Iowa.

During and following the year of graduate school McCoy ran the gamut of employers, bouncing around more local Iowa stations like KXIC where he kept area connections and was still a frequent guest on &quot;Two Guys Named Jim&quot;—a sports-talk show on WHO. He would eventually move from Iowa City, to WJJD in Chicago, to WHLD in Niagara Falls where he commenced broadcasting a “Steve Allen-type” piano-meets-disc jockey show for Buffalo, New York that was rejected by WHO. Three weeks after moving to Niagara Falls amidst a decade of constant transition and upheaval, he found stability in the form of Georgia Shahinian, born Koharig Shahinian, meeting her at a birthday party for a mutual friend. The two soon found themselves inseparable, and quickly became a daily part of each other&#x27;s lives.

As his radio contract in Buffalo was set to expire, McCoy got a tip from New York Giants play-by-play broadcaster Russ Hodges that the team would be relocating to San Francisco as their Triple-A farm team moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Both men felt McCoy had a good shot of securing the job. With major life decisions to be made quickly, Georgia &amp; Al McCoy were soon wed, hitching their lives on a trailer attached to his &#x27;54 Ford with no air conditioning, headed southwest in the summer of 1958.

===Early Phoenix career===
After getting married, Al &amp; Georgia McCoy moved to Phoenix, AZ in the summer of 1958. He was soon hired by KOOL, scheduled broadcaster for the Phoenix Giants, and he worked as the host of night-time radio shows for the station until the team completed their own move to the west coast.
With the Phoenix Giants, McCoy broadcast the only baseball game in history to be postponed due to grasshoppers, who collectively gathered around all the surrounding sources of light and placed the ball park in a shroud of darkness. McCoy described exiting the ball park grounds as “like driving around in snow. There&#x27;d be a drift of grasshoppers in the street. you&#x27;d start sliding around.” 

McCoy was occasionally visited during Phoenix Giants broadcasts by then-San Francisco Giants owner Horace Stoneham, who often told McCoy he would become the next “Voice of the Giants” in Major League Baseball. When the job was eventually offered, talk of a potential move of the team away from the west coast caused McCoy to decline, believing it to not be the “right fit.” During another period in time when the Giants job was again presented, McCoy briefly contemplated broadcasting both Suns and Giants games, planning to make a decision later, but was ultimately glad he did not. He would eventually one day fill-in as play-by-play for the San Francisco Giants for one single game, during a night the Suns were not playing.

The Triple-A team would also eventually leave Phoenix for Tacoma, WA due to a dispute over construction of a new ball park, while McCoy remained in Phoenix. Once the park was built, the team returned. In the interim five years without the Phoenix Giants, McCoy became &quot;One of the Good Guys&quot;, a DJ on KRUX 1360 AM. While on KRUX in the 1960s he also did play-by-play for ASU Sun Devil&#x27;s football and basketball. On local television stations KTVK and KTAR-TV, he did ring announcing work for boxing fights held at Phoenix Madison Square Garden, and also some professional wrestling commentary for the regional territory.

McCoy parted ways with the Phoenix Giants three years after their return to Phoenix in 1966. He would eventually return to baseball some 32-years later with the Arizona Diamondbacks during the club&#x27;s first season in 1998, paired with Joe Garagiola.
As the Western Hockey League expanded to Arizona in 1967, McCoy also began broadcasting for the Phoenix Roadrunners during the Giants&#x27; off-season. Less experienced with hockey, McCoy served as a color-commentator for two seasons before learning to do play-by-play for the ice on-the-fly after his broadcaster partner Jim Wells fell through a shower door. McCoy found he enjoyed doing hockey play-by-play, and Wells&#x27; agreed that it would be a better fit if they switched roles after his recovery. 

As his ongoing commitments to the Phoenix Giants, the Phoenix Roadrunners and other radio stations transitioned, he began to observe a “buzz” in the city over a potential new NBA expansion team and quickly made inroads to secure a job with the new franchise as it was officially announced in 1968.

==The Voice of the Suns==
Al McCoy served as the play-by-play &quot;Voice of the Phoenix Suns&quot; for 51 consecutive seasons, or every season excluding the first four years of franchise existence. He became a fixture of Phoenix media and local pop-culture as the central broadcaster for the Phoenix Suns on both radio and television until 2003, when Suns TV and Suns radio became separate media. McCoy continued to broadcast on the Suns Radio Network through the 2022-23 NBA season.

For 50 consecutive seasons (barring remote broadcasts during the pandemic) his official arena broadcast location had been stationed courtside, adjacent to the Suns players&#x27; home bench, as recent as May 2022. He stopped broadcasting road games in 2019 due to difficult vantage points at higher locations in other NBA arenas.

On October 2, 2022, his home broadcast location was moved higher up in the Suns arena, just beneath the skyboxes in the Footprint Center.

===The NBA arrives in Phoenix (1966–1972)===
In the fall of 1966 McCoy completed his first NBA broadcast during a preseason game at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum between the St. Louis Hawks and Golden State Warriors. Thrilled by the idea of professional basketball in Phoenix upon announcement of the scheduled game, he phoned the Hawks GM and brokered a deal for his then-employer KOOL-FM to broadcast the game in exchange for free advertising spots, making sure to record his broadcast as a demo for a potential future in basketball.

Two years later in 1968, the city of Phoenix was granted an expansion team that would become the Phoenix Suns. Immediately, prior to the start of the first season, McCoy slipped then-General Manager Jerry Colangelo a recording of that 1966 preseason game. Colangelo was blown away by what he heard and wanted McCoy to handle play-by-play for the team on planned broadcasts on local KTAR-AM and KTAR-TV. Tired of moving around from radio gig to radio gig, and seeking stability for his now-family of a wife and three sons, McCoy suggested Colangelo retain broadcast rights instead of selling them to another station, the routine sportscast policy of the time. McCoy suggested producing everything in-house, which was a new concept for the era. Colangelo liked McCoy&#x27;s pitch, but after inaugural season tickets were underselling, he ultimately decided to sell the rights to KTAR. Believing it was no longer the right move, McCoy declined working out a separate deal with the station.

Following multiple changes in Suns broadcasters over the next four seasons, GM and head coach Jerry Colangelo would eventually agree with McCoy about the Suns organization producing their own broadcasts, realizing he was often competing with the radio and television stations for Suns advertising. With one year left before the broadcast rights reverted to the organization, McCoy agreed to a contract with the Suns as Vice President of Broadcasting.

===The simulcast era (1972-2003)===
On September 27, 1972, McCoy broadcast his first game with the Suns, alongside Hot Rod Hundley, during the NBA preseason hosted by ABA team the Utah Stars. Initially, McCoy would handle production of both the radio and TV broadcasts by himself. He would hire a television crew in each city for road games after arriving in the destination city. He handled his own audio engineering and would, on an occasion or two, have to broadcast games via telephone due to technical difficulties. He helped sell advertising and would meet with any potential clients alongside Jerry Colangelo. McCoy observed &quot;maybe 8 people in the entire front office&quot; when he was hired, first-hand witnessing the Suns organization&#x27;s gradual and eventual growth into a company that now employs hundreds.

The first Triple-Overtime game in NBA Finals history, Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals at Boston Garden, was memorable in many ways to McCoy, who broadcast the game directly beside a group of rowdy, inebriated Celtics&#x27; fans, one of whom passed out on McCoy&#x27;s lap amidst the frenzy as &quot;The Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot; by Gar Heard sent the game into league-history. McCoy deftly pushed the fan off his lap and onto the floor mid-sentence as he continued his broadcast unabated.

He was also courtside, live on the air for the second Triple-Overtime game in NBA Finals History during Game 3 of the 1993 NBA Finals between the Charles Barkley-led Phoenix Suns and Michael Jordan&#x27;s Chicago Bulls.
The NBA&#x27;s adoption of the Three-point field goal in 1979 would prove as influential to McCoy&#x27;s career as it would to modern basketball itself. Upon its integration into the league, McCoy viewed the shot as the equivalent of a home-run in baseball. Noting that every baseball announcer has their own &quot;signature call&quot; for home-runs, he questioned what his NBA call could be. Thinking back to his childhood on the farm, his favorite comic book Captain Marvel and the moment mild-mannered Billy Batson transformed into the mighty Captain Marvel by shouting the word &quot;SHAZAM!&quot; to a flurry of thunder and lightning, McCoy believed this phrase - an acronym for the first initials of Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury - would convey the proper level of enormity and distinction he felt the shot deserved.

In July 2003, after 31 years of being simulcast on both television and radio, the Suns organization relented to growing NBA pressure to end the simulcast format after then Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo felt a younger presence would be better suited to TV. McCoy agreed to move to radio-only broadcasts on the previously established Suns Radio Network and was replaced on television play-by-play with Tom Leander, continuing with McCoy&#x27;s then-color-commentator and broadcast partner Eddie &quot;EJ&quot; Johnson.

===Radio days and industry recognition (2003–2022)===
Al McCoy continued to broadcast on radio and online web streaming exclusively, paired with former Sun Tim Kempton (&quot;See Suns Radio Network&quot;).

On the December 30, 2005, game against the Chicago Bulls, McCoy&#x27;s consecutive broadcasting streak officially ended due to illness when he woke up in Chicago with a hoarse throat. After finishing his pregame show, it was decided to run mostly audio of the TV broadcast with McCoy adding commentary for small moments, fully returning to the airwaves by the next game.

He was honored by the Naismith Hall of Fame on September 5, 2007, when he became the 17th recipient of the Curt Gowdy Media Award for broadcasters at a ceremony in Springfield, Massachusetts. He thanked his college professor, his high school basketball coach and Jerry Colangelo in his induction speech, and also highlighted the work of fellow basketball broadcasters Marty Glickman and Chick Hearn.

The next month, on October 5, 2007, then-team president Rick Welts and Suns managing partner Robert Sarver unveiled the Al McCoy Media Center, its walls and pillars adorned with photos, history, play-by-play quotes, and words of encouragement and respect from fellow NBA broadcasters honoring the life and career of Al McCoy, in the newly renamed arena pressroom.

McCoy returned to television play-by-play for one night on August 22, 2014, broadcasting the WNBA playoff opening game between the Phoenix Mercury hosting the Los Angeles Sparks for NBATV.

On October 26, 2016, during a Suns home game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, he officially became the longest-tenured broadcaster in NBA History, surpassing Chick Hearn of the Los Angeles Lakers previous broadcasting record. At halftime of the record-setting game, the arena ran a video montage before Suns managing partner Robert Sarver announced that McCoy would become the 15th member of the Suns Ring of Honor, as McCoy wiped a tear from his eye.

He was inducted into the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor on March 3, 2017, the Suns dedicated their game-winning performance to McCoy, a night which included special messages to McCoy from former Suns Steve Nash and Jason Kidd during timeouts, and a halftime honor from the vast majority of fellow Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor members. In his induction speech, McCoy thanked the organization, the fans and emphasized that &quot;every player that has ever put on a Suns uniform... is special to me, always will be,&quot; adding that he still very much feels the thrill of the game when the ball goes in the air, concluding,

On March 2, 2022, he was again honored by the Suns with &quot;Al McCoy Night&quot; in celebration of his 50th Season with the franchise, during a home game against the Portland Trail Blazers. Video tributes played in the arena, on Suns television and posted on social media featured messages from NBA commissioner Adam Silver, the Inside the NBA crew, and Steve Nash along with former and current Suns players. Longtime Suns TV color-commentator Eddie Johnson shared memories of working together with McCoy in his first years on the job, during the last years of the simulcast. And for one brief moment of a segment, the simulcast was brought back to television for the first time in 19-years as Suns TV ran audio of the live radio broadcast accompanied by live video of McCoy at courtside describing the action. Not interrupting his radio broadcast and during an untelevised timeout, McCoy was given a standing ovation by screaming fans at the Footprint Center as Suns P.A. announced his name to the sold-out arena.

The next month, immediately after the Suns set a new franchise record for the regular season on April 5, 2022, Suns player Devin Booker went to the side, signed his game jersey (writing &quot;To Al, the legend. Franchise record!&quot;) and presented it to Al McCoy at his longtime courtside broadcast position (which would end upon his removal from courtside on October 4, 2022), as he shook both of McCoy&#x27;s hands and congratulated him, saying &quot;50th season, baby! Franchise record. Love you, man. Appreciate you, for real.&quot;

Five days later on April 10, 2022, Mayor of Phoenix Kate Gallego issued an official proclamation declaring the date as &quot;Al McCoy Day&quot; in the city of Phoenix, in honor of his 50th season and &quot;to say thank you for guiding us through so many Suns victories and helping us celebrate with a &#x27;Whammo&#x27; or &#x27;SHAZAM!&#x27; when we needed it the most.&quot;

On December 17, 2022, he served as the Grand Marshal of the 2022 Fiesta Bowl Parade.

===Final seasons and retirement (2022–2023)===
McCoy was vocal in his opposition of NBA teams and NBA arenas increasingly moving the broadcast locations for radio crews away from the floor and placing them in locations high above courtside where portions of the court are partially obscured. McCoy states in many of these arenas as a result it&#x27;s difficult to keep track of the three-point field goal. He often highlights a story of broadcaster Joe Tait telling his listening audience during a live play-by-play call that the three-point shot was good &quot;by a player to be named later,&quot; due to the angle in TD Garden blocking vantage beyond the three point arc.

McCoy wrote in his autobiography that he prefers broadcasting courtside not only for the complete view of the court, but also because it enables him to keep on top of personnel changes, player and coach interactions, clarification of referee calls, and the general flow of the game for the listening audience.

When fellow broadcasting veteran Hot Rod Hundley&#x27;s courtside position for the Utah Jazz was moved higher up in the Vivint Arena following the conclusion of the Utah simulcast in 2005, he retired a mere four-years later by 2009 due to the increased strain on his hips and knees. In an essay included in McCoy&#x27;s autobiography, Hundley described offering fans seated around him his binoculars, writing &quot;It&#x27;s terrible from upstairs. We make mistakes. On the floor you would never miss a beat.&quot;
At the start of the 2010–11 NBA season McCoy began reducing his road games schedule for &quot;select East Coast road trips.&quot; By the 2018-19 NBA season he had decided to retire from broadcasting road games altogether. When asked in an interview with ESPN announcer Dave Pasch why he has elected to stop traveling, McCoy stressed the increasingly poor broadcast locations for radio broadcasters and emphasized,

On October 2, 2022, ahead of the 2022-2023 NBA Season, Al McCoy&#x27;s Suns home game broadcast location since 1972 and as recent as the 2022 NBA Playoffs in May 2022 was moved from its longtime courtside position on the floor to higher up in the arena, many rows up at the back of the 100s sections, closer to the skybox-area of the Footprint Center.

Video confirming McCoy&#x27;s new distant broadcast location was posted to the Arizona Sports official YouTube channel on February 24, 2023, recorded during a post-game interview with Ish Wainright.

==Personal life and death==
McCoy was married to his wife Georgia until her death in 2012, and they have three children. He also had seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

McCoy died on September 21, 2024, at the age of 91.

<doc id="98538" wikidata="Q232453" url="?curid=98538" title="Martha">
<text>Martha (Aramaic: מָרְתָא‎) is a biblical figure described in the Gospels of Luke and John. Together with her siblings Lazarus and Mary of Bethany, she is described as living in the village of Bethany near Jerusalem and witnessing Jesus resurrecting her brother, Lazarus. 
==Etymology of the name==
The name &quot;Martha&quot; is a Latin transliteration of the Koine Greek Μάρθα, itself a transliteration of the Aramaic מָרְתָא‎ &quot;Mârtâ&quot;, &quot;the mistress&quot; or &quot;the lady&quot;, from מרה &quot;mistress&quot;, feminine of מר &quot;master.&quot; The Aramaic form occurs in a Nabatean inscription found at Puteoli, and now in the Naples Museum; it is dated AD 5 (Corpus Inscr. Semit., 158); also in a Palmyrene inscription, where the Greek translation has the form &quot;Marthein&quot;.

==Biblical references==
In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus visits the home of two sisters named Mary and Martha. The two sisters are contrasted: Martha was &quot;encumbered about many things&quot; while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen &quot;the better part&quot;, that of listening to the master&#x27;s discourse. The name of their village is not recorded, nor (unlike in John 11:18) is there any mention of whether Jesus was near Jerusalem. Biblical commentator Heinrich Meyer notes that &quot;Jesus cannot yet be in Bethany, where Martha and Mary dwelt [according to John&#x27;s Gospel]&quot;. But the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges claims that it was &quot;undoubtedly Bethany&quot;.

In the Gospel of John, Martha and Mary appear in connection with two incidents: the raising from the dead of their brother Lazarus (John 11) and the anointing of Jesus in Bethany (John 12:3).

In the account of the raising of Lazarus, when Jesus hears of the death it is noted that &quot;Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus&quot; (John 11:5). Upon arrival, Jesus meets with the sisters in turn: Martha followed by Mary. Martha goes immediately to meet Jesus as he arrives, while Mary waits until she is called. As one commentator notes, &quot;Martha, the more aggressive sister, went to meet Jesus, while quiet and contemplative Mary stayed home. This portrayal of the sisters agrees with that found in Luke 10:38–42.&quot; In speaking with Jesus, both sisters lament that he did not arrive in time to prevent their brother&#x27;s death: &quot;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died&quot;. But where Jesus&#x27; response to Mary is more emotional, his response to Martha is one of teaching, calling her to hope and faith:

As the narrative continues, Martha calls her sister Mary to see Jesus. Jesus has Mary bring him to Lazarus&#x27; tomb where he commands the stone to be removed from its entrance. Martha here objects, &quot;But, Lord, by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days&quot;, to which Jesus replies, &quot;Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?&quot;. They then take away the stone and Jesus prays and calls Lazarus forth alive from the tomb.

Martha appears again in John 12:1–8, where she serves at a meal held in Jesus&#x27; honor at which her brother is also a guest. The narrator only mentions that the meal takes place in Bethany, while the apparently parallel accounts in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark specify that it takes place at the home of one Simon the Leper. As the Catholic Encyclopedia notes, &quot;We are surely justified in arguing that, since Matthew and Mark place the scene in the house of Simon, St. John must be understood to say the same; it remains to be proven that Martha could not &#x27;serve&#x27; in Simon&#x27;s house.&quot; It is at this meal that a woman (Martha&#x27;s sister Mary, according to John) anoints Jesus with expensive perfume.

==Western traditions==
In medieval Western Christianity, Martha&#x27;s sister Mary was often equated with Mary Magdalene. This identification led to additional information being attributed to Martha as well:

Mary, Martha, and Lazarus are represented by St. John as living at Bethania, but St. Luke would seem to imply that they were, at least at one time, living in Galilee; he does not mention the name of the town, but it may have been Magdala, and we should thus, supposing Mary of Bethania and Mary Magdalene to be the same person, understand the appellative &quot;Magdalene&quot;. The words of St. John (11:1) seem to imply a change of residence for the family. It is possible, too, that St. Luke has displaced the incident referred to in Chapter 10. The likeness between the pictures of Martha presented by Luke and John is very remarkable. The familiar intercourse between the Saviour of the world and the humble family which St. Luke depicts is dwelt on by St. John when he tells us that &quot;Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus&quot; (11:5). Again the picture of Martha&#x27;s anxiety (John 11:20–21, 39) accords with the picture of her who was &quot;busy about much serving&quot; (Luke 10:40); so also in John 12:2: &quot;They made him a supper there: and Martha served.&quot; But St. John has given us a glimpse of the other and deeper side of her character when he depicts her growing faith in Christ&#x27;s Divinity (11:20–27), a faith which was the occasion of the words: &quot;I am the resurrection and the life.&quot; The Evangelist has beautifully indicated the change that came over Martha after that interview: &quot;When she had said these things, she went and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The Master is come, and calleth for thee.&quot;

==Eastern Orthodox tradition==
In Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, though not specifically named as such in the gospels, Martha and Mary were among the Myrrh-bearing Women. These faithful followers of Jesus stood at Golgotha during the Crucifixion of Jesus and later came to his tomb early on the morning following Sabbath with myrrh (expensive oil), according to the Jewish tradition, to anoint their Lord&#x27;s body. The Myrrhbearers became the first witnesses to the Resurrection of Jesus, finding the empty tomb and hearing the joyful news from an angel.

Orthodox tradition also relates that Martha&#x27;s brother Lazarus was cast out of Jerusalem in the persecution against the Jerusalem Church following the martyrdom of St. Stephen. His sister Martha fled Judea with him, assisting him in the proclaiming of the Gospel in various lands, while Mary Magdalene remained with John the Apostle and assisted him with the Church of Jerusalem. According to Cyprian tradition, Lazarus and Martha later came to Cyprus, where Lazarus became the first Bishop of Kittim (modern Larnaca). All three died in Cyprus.

==Veneration==
Martha is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, and commemorated by the Lutheran Church and the Anglican Communion.
Through time, as the reverence for St. Martha developed, the images of maturity, strength, common sense, and concern for others predominated.

===Feast days===
====Roman Catholic====
The Latin Church celebrates the feast day of Martha, Mary of Bethany and their brother Lazarus on 29 July. The feast of Martha, classified as a &quot;semi-double&quot; in the Tridentine calendar, became a &quot;simple&quot; one in the General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII, a &quot;third class feast&quot; in the General Roman Calendar of 1960, and a memorial in the present General Roman Calendar.

Until 2021, the liturgical celebration had been solely of Martha, except among the Benedictines. In that year, Pope Francis changed it to commemorate the entire family. He further clarified that, contrary to widespread speculation, this Mary was a separate individual from Mary Magdalene, called the Apostle to the Apostles. 

====Orthodoxy====
The Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches commemorate Martha and her sister Mary on 4 June. They also commemorate them collectively among the Myrrh-bearing Women on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers (the Third Sunday of Pascha – i.e., the second Sunday after Easter Sunday). Martha also figures in the commemorations of Lazarus Saturday (the day before Palm Sunday).

====Lutheran====
Martha is commemorated on 29 July in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church, together with Mary and Lazarus. 

====Anglican====
Martha is also commemorated on 29 July in the Calendar of saints of the Episcopal Church.

Martha is remembered (with Mary and Lazarus) in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 29 July.

The Sisters of Saint Martha are a religious congregation founded in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, in 1894.

==Legends and myths==

===Golden Legend===
According to legend, St. Martha left Judea after Jesus&#x27; resurrection, around AD 48, and went to Provence with her sister Mary (conflated with Mary Magdalene) and her brother Lazarus. With them, Martha first settled in Avignon (now in France). The &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, compiled in the 13th century, records the Provençal tradition:

Saint Martha, hostess of our Lord Jesus Christ, was born of a royal kindred. Her father was named Syro and her mother Encharia. The father of her was duke of Syria and places maritime, and Martha with her sister possessed by the heritage of their mother three places, that was, the castle Magdalen, and Bethany and a part of Jerusalem. It is nowhere read that Martha had ever any husband nor fellowship of man, but she as a noble hostess ministered and served our Lord, and would also that her sister should serve him and help her, for she thought that all the world was not sufficient to serve such a guest.After the ascension of our Lord, when the disciples were departed, she with her brother Lazarus and her sister Mary, also Saint Maximin [actually a 3rd-century figure] which baptized them, and to whom they were committed of the Holy Ghost, and many others, were put into a ship without sail, oars, or rudder governail, of the paynims, which by the conduct of our Lord they came all to Marseille, and after came to the territory of Aquense or Aix, and there converted the people to the faith. Martha was right facound of speech, and courteous and gracious to the sight of the people.

The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; also records the grand lifestyle imagined for Martha and her siblings in its entry on Mary Magdalene:

Mary Magdalene had her surname of Magdala, a castle, and was born of right noble lineage and parents, which were descended of the lineage of kings. And her father was named Cyrus, and her mother Eucharis. She with her brother Lazarus, and her sister Martha, possessed the castle of Magdala, which is two miles from Nazareth, and Bethany, the castle which is nigh to Jerusalem, and also a great part of Jerusalem, which, all these things they departed among them. In such wise that Mary had the castle Magdala, whereof she had her name Magdalene. And Lazarus had the part of the city of Jerusalem, and Martha had to her part Bethany. And when Mary gave herself to all delights of the body, and Lazarus entended all to knighthood, Martha, which was wise, governed nobly her brother&#x27;s part and also her sister&#x27;s, and also her own, and administered to knights, and her servants, and to poor men, such necessities as they needed. Nevertheless, after the ascension of our Lord, they sold all these things.

===St. Martha in Tarascon===
A further legend relates that Martha then went to Tarascon, France, where a monster, the Tarasque, was a constant threat to the population. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; describes it as a beast from Galatia; a great dragon, half beast and half fish, greater than an ox, longer than a horse, having teeth sharp as a sword, and horned on either side, head like a lion, tail like a serpent, that dwelt in a certain wood between Arles and Avignon. Holding a cross in her hand, Martha sprinkled the beast with holy water. Placing her sash around its neck, she led the tamed dragon through the village.
There Martha lived, daily occupied in prayers and in fastings. Martha eventually died in Tarascon, where she was buried. Her tomb is located in the crypt of the local Collegiate Church.

The dedication of the Collegiate Church at Tarascon to St. Martha is believed to date from the 9th century or earlier. Relics found in the church during a reconstruction in 1187 were identified as hers, and reburied in a new shrine at that time. In the Collegiate Church crypt is a late 15th-century cenotaph, also known as the Gothic Tomb of Saint Martha. It is the work of Francesco Laurana, a Croatian sculptor of the Italian School, commissioned by King René. At its base are two openings through which the relics could be touched. It bears three low reliefs separated by fluted pilasters representing: on the left, Saint Martha and the Tarasque; in the center, Saint Mary Magdalene borne aloft by the angels; on the right, Lazarus as Bishop of Marseille with his mitre and staff. There are two figures on either side: on the left, Saint Front, Bishop of Perrigueux, present at the funeral of Saint Martha, and on the right, Saint Marcelle, Martha&#x27;s servant.

===St. Martha and Villajoyosa===
The town of Villajoyosa, Spain, honors St. Martha as its patron saint and celebrates The Festival of Moors and Christians annually in her honor. The 250-year-old festival commemorates the attack on Villajoyosa by Berber pirates led by Zalé-Arraez in 1538, when, according to legend, St. Martha came to the rescue of the townsfolk by causing a flash flood which wiped out the enemy fleet, thus preventing the corsairs from reaching the coast.

===St. Martha and Pateros===

Tradition recounts that in the 1800s, Saint Martha (who legendarily subdued the Tarasque), was invoked by the people of Pateros, a town in Metro Manila, Philippines, to vanquish a crocodile in the Pateros River that ate their ducks. These animals were the main source of the townspeople&#x27;s livelihood as their eggs are the main ingredient of the delicacy, &quot;Balút&quot; (fertilised duck egg), which is what the town is known for.

One evening, under a full moon, an unnamed female &quot;bayani&quot; (hero) went to the river to tame the creature. At the river banks, the crocodile saw a light surrounding the figure, who was actually Saint Martha. At the sight of the glowing figure, the creature disappeared and the local duck industry once again flourished. The people of Pateros attributed this event to Saint Martha and a grand fluvial procession in honor of her has been held yearly since, in remembrance of the event.

==Gnostic tradition==
Martha appears in the sacred gnostic text &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;. She is instructed by the risen Christ on several of the repentances that must be made in order to have salvation. She also makes several prophetic interpretations of different Psalms.

==Depictions in art and literature==

The subject of Martha is mostly found in art from the Counter-Reformation onwards, especially in the 17th century, when the domestic setting is usually given a realistic depiction. Typically, Mary, the elder sister, is preparing or serving food, while Martha is listening to Christ. However, it appears in some Ottonian cycles of the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;.

*&quot;Christ in the House of Martha and Mary&quot; (Velázquez), a 1618 oil-on-canvas painting by the Spanish painter Velázquez.
*&quot;Christ in the House of Martha and Mary&quot; (Vermeer), a 1655 painting by Johannes Vermeer.
*&quot;Martha and Mary Magdalene&quot; (Caravaggio), a 1598-9 painting by the Italian Baroque master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio.

Literary works about Martha include: 
*&quot;Martha and Mary&quot;, a story in Karel Čapek&#x27;s &quot;Apocryphal Tales&quot; (1932)
*&quot;Saint Martha and the Dragon&quot;, a poem by Charles Causley in his collected works.
*&quot;The Sons of Martha&quot; (1907), a poem by Rudyard Kipling.
*In &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the dystopian novel of Margaret Atwood, infertile women forced to be servants for the ruling class are called &quot;Marthas&quot;, as their service is considered imitating Martha.

<doc id="98542" wikidata="Q2000502" url="?curid=98542" title="North Beach, San Francisco">
<text>North Beach is a neighborhood in the northeast of San Francisco adjacent to Chinatown, the Financial District, and Russian Hill. The neighborhood is San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Little Italy&quot; and has historically been home to a large Italian American population, largely from Northern Italy. It still has many Italian restaurants and a sizeable Italian community, though many other ethnic groups currently live in the neighborhood. It was also the historic center of the beatnik subculture and has become one of San Francisco&#x27;s main nightlife districts as well as a residential neighborhood populated by a mix of young urban professionals, families, and Chinese immigrants.

The American Planning Association (APA) has named North Beach as one of ten &quot;Great Neighborhoods in America&quot;.

==Location==
North Beach is bounded by the former Barbary Coast, now Jackson Square, the Financial District south of Broadway, Chinatown to the southwest of Columbus below Green Street, Russian Hill to the west, Telegraph Hill to the east and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf at Bay Street to the north.

Main intersections are Union and Columbus, the southwest corner of Washington Square, Grant Avenue, and Vallejo Street.

The neighborhood consists of modern, mid-century apartments, duplexes, and Victorian homes and multiplexes.

== History ==

Originally, the city&#x27;s northeast shoreline extended only to what is today Taylor and Francisco streets. The area largely known today as North Beach &quot;was&quot; an actual beach, filled in with land fill around the late 19th century. Warehouses, fishing wharves, and docks were then built on the newly formed shoreline. Due to the proximity of the docks, the southern half of the neighborhood south of Broadway was home of the infamous Barbary Coast.

In 1890, Elizabeth Ashe and Alice Griffith founded what would become the Telegraph Hill Neighborhood Center to help fight illness, illiteracy and poor conditions in North Beach and lobbied hard for better recreation opportunities for neighborhood children. In 1907, the city formed its first playground commission with the idea of carving out space for recreation areas specifically for kids. The first playground commission picked two sites, including the North Beach Playground. The plan included an outdoor swimming pool, which was financed by diverting funds from a fire department cistern planned for Powell and Lombard, perhaps the first publicly financed public pool in the city. In 1910, the North Beach playground and pool was constructed. The three youngest of the nine DiMaggio kids, Vince, Joe and Dom, grew up playing baseball there in the 1920s and became professional baseball players.

After the 1906 earthquake reconstruction, a large number of Italian immigrants created the Italian character of the neighborhood that still exists. Prominent Italian Americans that came from the neighborhood include baseball legend Joe DiMaggio who grew up in the neighborhood and briefly returned to live there with his wife Marilyn Monroe during the 1950s, as well as former San Francisco mayor and politician Joseph Alioto plus others from the prominent Alioto family.

North Beach was home to the first lesbian bar in San Francisco, Mona&#x27;s 440 Club. Mona Sargeant and her husband Jimmie opened Mona&#x27;s in 1936 in a North Beach basement as a small underground bar celebrating the end of Prohibition. Once Mona&#x27;s gained enough popularity between the gay community and tourists, the club moved to a much larger location at 440 Broadway Street. The club remained Mona&#x27;s 440 until the mid-1950s.

During the 1950s, many of the neighborhood&#x27;s cafes and bars became the home and epicenter of the Beat Generation and gave rise to the San Francisco Renaissance. The term &quot;beatnik&quot; originated from the scene here and was coined in a derogatory fashion by famed &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Herb Caen. Many of that generation&#x27;s most famous writers and personalities such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Neal Cassady lived in the neighborhood. Another poet from this generation, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, founded the City Lights Bookstore that still exists today on the corner of Broadway and Columbus as an official historic landmark and serves as one of the main focal points of this generation.

During the 1960s a notable night spot was The Committee, an improvisational theater group founded by alumni of The Second City in Chicago. The Committee opened April 10, 1963, at 622 Broadway in a 300-seat cabaret theater.

The Broadway area also created innovations for the strip club industry. The Condor Club, on the corner of Columbus and Broadway, was opened in 1964 as America&#x27;s first topless bar, which it is again today. The Lusty Lady was the first striptease club to be structured as a worker cooperative, which meant that it was managed by the dancers who worked at that peep-show establishment. Broadway strip clubs owe their legacy to the Barbary Coast, which was located just one block south on Pacific Street during the late 19th century.
In the 1970s and 1980s Broadway was the location of many live music clubs, like the Stone, and a punk rock club called Mabuhay Gardens.

After World War II, and accelerated during the Korean War, the Italian American population has been moving out of the Little Italy sections of North Beach, Telegraph Hill, and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf due to suburbanization. Since the 1980s, and much like Manhattan&#x27;s Little Italy, due to a decrease in emigration from Italy and gentrification, the neighborhood has seen its native Italian American population rapidly shrink. The neighborhood has since seen neighboring Chinatown expanding north into the neighborhood south of Broadway and along Stockton Street, causing a major demographic shift to a mix of mostly Chinese and young professional population, with few Italian Americans remaining.

In 2000 after some negotiations, the heirs of Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s estate, two granddaughters and their four children, welcomed the renaming of North Beach playground as the Joe DiMaggio North Beach Playground. In 2015, the first renovation of the playground in more than 50 years was completed.

Paul Kantner of the Jefferson Airplane was living in North Beach in an apartment unit above Al&#x27;s Attire at the corner of Grant Avenue and Vallejo Street at the time of his death in 2016, and was often a patron of nearby Caffe Trieste.

==Attractions and characteristics==

===Events===

* The North Beach Festival street fair on Grant Avenue and Columbus Avenue usually held on Father&#x27;s Day weekend in June is one of the city&#x27;s largest. It is also considered one of the nation&#x27;s oldest street fairs.
* The Italian Heritage Parade, formerly known as the Columbus Day Parade, is the United States&#x27; longest continuously run Italian heritage celebration. The route goes from Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, San Francisco, along Columbus Avenue, to Washington Square, in front of Saints Peter and Paul Church, San Francisco. The event celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2018.

===Population===

The neighborhood still retains an Italian character with many Italian restaurants, cafes, and bakeries that line Columbus Avenue and Washington Square.

===Religious institutions and sites===
* The National Shrine of Saint Francis of Assisi, the city&#x27;s namesake, is located on Vallejo Street.
* Known as &quot;The Italian Cathedral of the West&quot;, Saints Peter and Paul Church is located on the north side of Filbert Street in front of Washington Square. Joe DiMaggio married his first wife there, and came for photos after his marriage to Marilyn Monroe. Saints Peter and Paul is considered a San Francisco landmark and an emblematic tie to the neighborhood&#x27;s Italian American past.

===Secular institutions and sites===
* An alleyway between Columbus and Grant Avenues is named for Beat Generation writer Jack Kerouac, who once lived there and frequented the famous City Lights Bookstore on the corner of Columbus and Broadway as well as the numerous nearby bars and coffee shops.

<doc id="98550" wikidata="Q1153962" url="?curid=98550" title="Oda Nobuhide">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; and magistrate of the Sengoku period known as &quot;Tiger of Owari&quot; and also the father of Oda Nobunaga, the first &quot;Great Unifier&quot; of Japan. Nobuhide was a deputy &quot;shugo&quot; (Shugodai) of lower Owari Province and head of the Oda clan which controlled most of Owari.

==Biography==
Oda Nobuhide was born in 1510 in Owari Province, the eldest son of Oda Nobusada, the head of the Oda clan and a &quot;shugodai&quot; (deputy &quot;shugo&quot;) of the lower Owari area. Nobuhide became head of the Oda clan when Nobusada died in 1538, and became involved in open warfare as he was confronted to the north by Saitō Dōsan, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Mino Province, and to the east by Imagawa Yoshimoto, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Mikawa, Suruga, and Tōtōmi provinces.

At certain year, Nobuhide invaded and besiege Ida castle in Mikawa. Sakai Tadatsugu and Naitō Nobunari were reportedly sallied out fighting Nobuhide&#x27;s army to defend the castle.

In 1540, Nobuhide attacked and took Anjō castle, which was held by the Matsudaira clan. He was assisted by Mizuno Tadamasa, his son, Oda Nobuhiro, was installed as the lord of the castle.

In 1542, he defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto at First Battle of Azukizaka. Nobuhide managed to hold his own against his opponents, but was never able to fully unite Owari due to constant internal struggles within Oda clan, which prevented him from achieving a complete victory.

In 1543, he donated 4000 kan (The currency of Japan at that time) to the Imperial Court in Kyoto for the repair expenses of the Imperial Palace, while Imagawa Yoshimoto&#x27;s donation was 500 kan. With such financial resources, the Oda clan came to possess more power than the Shiba clan (&quot;Shugo&quot; of Owari). Nobuhide&#x27;s economic policies were steadily passed down to his son and heir, Nobunaga.

In 1547, Nobuhide was defeated at the Battle of Kanōguchi by Saitō Dōsan.

In 1548, Imagawa defeated Nobuhide in the Second Battle of Azukizaka and continued to expand his territory until 1560.

In 1549, Nobuhide made peace with Dōsan by arranging a political marriage between his eldest son, Oda Nobunaga, and Saitō Dōsan&#x27;s daughter, Nōhime. Dōsan supported the marriage which allowed Nobuhide to focus on facing Yoshimoto. In one of his moments of glory, Nobuhide managed to capture Matsudaira Hirotada&#x27;s son and heir, Matsudaira Motoyasu (later known as Tokugawa Ieyasu) as a hostage, to en route Yoshimoto and was thus able to gain some footholds into Mikawa.

Nobuhide died unexpectedly in 1551, and his remains are interred in a little-known alley near Osu Kannon temple in Nagoya.

==Succession controversy==
Nobuhide&#x27;s eldest son, Oda Nobuhiro, was illegitimate. Therefore, Nobuhide designated his eldest legitimate son, Nobunaga, to succeed him as the head of the Oda clan and its small domain. Nobunaga, who hardly knew his father and already had a bad reputation as a delinquent in Owari, arrived inappropriately dressed at Nobuhide&#x27;s funeral and threw incense at the altar of the temple as he cursed his fate. Nobunaga&#x27;s behavior and reputation resulted in almost all support that Nobuhide&#x27;s retainers would have given him to disappear. Almost all Oda retainers and Nobunaga&#x27;s mother Tsuchida Gozen favored his younger brother, Oda Nobuyuki, who was considered to be well-behaved and reputable. As a result, Nobunaga was left with support from Hirate Masahide and his father-in-law Saitō Dōsan, whom he had never met before, and a succession crisis. Many of Nobuhide&#x27;s relatives and retainers attempted to usurp his heir, and it would take seven years for Nobunaga to consolidate his power within the Oda clan and finally unite Owari Province. Nobunaga eventually conquered most of Japan, beginning his campaign in Owari, and became known as the first of the three &quot;Great Unifiers&quot; of the Sengoku period.

<doc id="98551" wikidata="Q2721589" url="?curid=98551" title="Fumble">
<text>A fumble in gridiron football occurs when a player who has possession and control of the ball loses it before being downed (tackled), scoring, or going out of bounds. By rule, it is any act other than passing, kicking, punting, or successful handing that results in loss of ball possession by a player. Unlike other events which cause the ball to become loose, such as an incomplete pass, a fumbled ball is considered a live ball, and may be recovered and advanced by any member of either team.

A fumble may be forced by a defensive player who either grabs or punches the ball or butts the ball with their helmet (a move called &quot;tackling the ball&quot;). A fumbled ball may be recovered and advanced by either team (except, in American football, after the two-minute warning in either half/overtime or on 4th down at any point during the game, when the fumbler is the only offensive player allowed to advance the ball, otherwise the ball is ruled dead at the spot of the fumble, except when it is recovered for a loss).

A fumble is one of three events that can cause a turnover (the other two being an interception or a turnover on downs).

Under American rules a fumble may be confused with a muff. A muff occurs where a player drops a ball that he does not have clear possession of, such as while attempting to catch a lateral pass or improperly fielding a kicking play such as a punt (a player cannot &quot;fumble&quot; a loose ball). Ball security is the ability of a player to maintain control over the football during play and thus avoid a fumble. Thus, losing possession of the ball via a fumble includes not only dropping the ball before being downed; but, also having a ball taken away, or “stripped” from the runner&#x27;s possession before being downed.

==Rules==
If the ball is fumbled the defensive team may recover the ball and even advance it to their opponents&#x27; goal. The same is true for the offense, but usually, when the offense recovers the ball they simply try to down it. In American football, the offense cannot advance the ball if it recovers its own fumble on fourth down, or in the last two minutes of a half/overtime unless the fumbler recovers the ball (there are no such restrictions in Canadian football). However, the defense cannot advance the ball either if they fumble the ball back to the offense (unless it is recovered by the defensive fumbler). However, if the offense fumbles the ball, the defense recovers, and then fumbles back to the offense, they would get a new first down since possession had formally changed over the course of the play even though the ball had never been blown dead. In American football, there is no separate signal to indicate a fumble recovery. If the offense recovers its own fumble and down it, the official will indicate the recovery by a hand signal showing the next down. If the defense recovers the fumble, the official will indicate with a &quot;first down&quot; signal in the direction the recovering team is driving the ball. Some officials have erroneously used a &quot;first down&quot; signal when the offense recovers its own fumble and the recovery did not result in a first down.

It is not a fumble when a forward pass is attempted and is not caught. In this latter case, it is simply an incomplete pass. However, if the receiver catches the ball, but then drops it after gaining control of the ball, that is a fumble.

Any number of fumbles can be committed during a play, including fumbles by the team originally on defense. Most famously, Dallas Cowboys defender Leon Lett fumbled during Super Bowl XXVII while celebrating during his own fumble return.

A sometimes controversial maxim is &quot;the ground cannot cause a fumble&quot;. If a player is tackled and loses control of the ball at or after the time he makes contact with the ground, the player is treated as down and the ball is not in play. However, in the NFL and CFL, if a ball carrier falls without an opponent contacting him, the ground can indeed cause a fumble. This is because in those leagues the ball carrier is not &quot;down&quot; unless an opponent first makes contact, or the runner is out of bounds. In most other leagues, as soon as the knee or elbow touches the ground, the ball carrier is considered down. It is also possible for the ground to cause a fumble in college football if the ball hits the ground before any part of the ball carrier&#x27;s body (other than the hand or foot) touches the ground. An example was the fumble by Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner vs. Tennessee in 1998.

When a fumbled ball goes out of bounds before being recovered, the result varies:
* A fumble going out of bounds between the end zones is retained by the last team with possession (in Canadian football, the last team to touch the ball). If the ball was moving backwards with regard to the recovering team, it is spotted where it went out of bounds. If the ball was moving forwards, it is spotted where the fumble occurred (the fumble itself cannot advance the ball).
* If a ball is fumbled in the field of play, goes forward into the opponent&#x27;s end zone, and then goes over the end line or sideline, a touchback is awarded to the defensive team.
* If a team fumbles the ball out of bounds in its own end zone (even if the ball moves forward out of the end zone before going out of bounds), or fumbles in the field of play and the ball then goes into that team&#x27;s end zone and out of bounds, the result depends on which team caused the ball to enter the end zone. If the possessing team possessed or forced the ball into the end zone, it is a safety, subject to the momentum rules that apply to safeties. If the opponent forced the ball into the end zone, it is a touchback.
** However, in the USFL and XFL, a ball fumbled by the offense within the field of play that goes out of bounds in the defensive team&#x27;s end zone is not a touchback. Instead, the ball is spotted at the spot of the fumble, with the offense retaining possession unless the fumble occurred on fourth down before the offense reached the line to gain, in which case the defense receives possession.

A fumbled ball that is touched by an out-of-bounds player is considered an out-of-bounds fumble, even if the ball never leaves the field of play.

In addition, a punted or place-kicked ball that touches any part of a player on the receiving team, whether or not the player ever gains control, is considered to be live and is treated like a fumble. Also, lateral passes that are caught by a member of the opposing team are recorded as fumbles as opposed to interceptions.

==Play during fumbles==

Since footballs tend to bounce in unpredictable ways, particularly on artificial turf, attempting to recover and advance a fumbled ball is risky even for those with good manual coordination. Coaches at lower levels of the game usually therefore prefer that players, particularly those such as interior linemen who do not normally handle the ball in the course of play, simply fall on the ball. Gaining or retaining possession is more important in most situations than attempting to advance the ball and possibly score, and there have been many instances where those attempting to do so have wound up fumbling the ball back to the other team.

Recovering and advancing a fumble is also made difficult, and potentially injurious, by the effect on play. Since neither team is on offense or defense while the ball remains loose, there are no restrictions on the type of contact allowed as long as all players are making legitimate efforts to recover it. A loose ball has been described as the only situation in football where the rules are suspended.

If the ball remains loose, every player on the field will eventually gravitate towards it, increasing the chaos around it. Spectators relish the suspense. Some players, particularly offensive linemen, have a reputation for taking advantage of the situation to do things to opponents that would otherwise draw penalties, since the officials&#x27; attention is necessarily focused on the ball and away from the players trying to get to it. Most commonly, players will &quot;pile on&quot; opponents already down trying to recover the ball. Some NFL players also report that pokes in the eyes, pinches or other abuse is common in post-fumble pileups, conduct which has sometimes led to confrontations, fights or even brawls.

The usual aftermath of a fumble, at every level of play, is a pile of players, many still squirming diligently despite the whistle, surrounded by teammates pointing upfield (the hand signal for a first down) while the officials slowly extricate them in an effort to determine who has won possession. If two different players have hands on the ball, it is often a judgement call on the officials&#x27; part as to which team gets it. In the NFL and CFL this has often been the occasion for coaches to call for a review of the instant replay.

Fumbles recovered for touchdowns in the end zone are often the only way offensive linemen score points.

===Proper fumble recovery===
The most obvious way to recover a loose football would be to fall prone atop it and cradle it between both arms against the abdomen. Amateur players are seen doing this all the time, particularly when playing touch football, and it can even be seen in professional contests.

However, coaches tell players not to do this in game situations if at all possible, since not only is the ball likely to squirt loose again once other players pile on, there is also a possibility of injury, such as a ruptured spleen, from the ball being driven into the soft organs with great force.

Instead, players are taught to fall on their sides and augment their cradling with a thigh and upper body, if possible. This greatly reduces both the chance of losing the ball and the potential for injury (at least from the ball).

Fumbles cannot be recovered with any body part that does not also involve at least one of the recovering player&#x27;s arms.

Coaches are also increasingly encouraging their players to use the &quot;scoop and score&quot; method of picking it up and attempting to return it for a touchdown.

==Intentional fumbling==
A very rarely used trick play known as the &quot;fake fumble&quot; calls for the quarterback to lay the ball on the ground as he backs up after receiving the snap, so that a pulling guard can pick it up and run the ball around the end. Coaches are very leery of calling this, however, as a team must be able to execute it flawlessly in order for it to have a chance of working in a game situation. The guard must also be able to run the ball competently and protect it when being tackled, both not usually part of the skill set for the position.

The &quot;fake fumble&quot; is in fact a real one as far as the rules are concerned, and if the defense manages to get the ball, the coach&#x27;s judgement is likely to be questioned by fans and media alike. While it is a crowd pleaser when done properly, the risk far outweighs the likely reward . For this reason it is most likely to be used in informal touch football games. It was sometimes used in the college game before the NCAA banned it in 1992. It has almost never been used in the NFL or any other professional league.

The best-known fake fumble is probably the Fumblerooski play in the 1984 Orange Bowl (see below).

Fumbling forward, as the Holy Roller play (see below) demonstrated, once was a viable offensive tactic in desperate situations, but the rules have been changed to discourage that.

==Use in place of opening coin toss==
The XFL, a competing pro league which played its sole season in 2001, used a fumble recovery instead of a coin toss to decide which team would get to choose whether to kick off or receive at the opening of the game and before overtime. A player from each team would sprint, alongside the other, toward a loose ball at the middle of the field, and whoever was able to gain possession won the right for their team to decide.

The idea was that such a key element of the game would be decided by a test of playing skill, not chance. Because of a high rate of injury in these events, the idea never caught on in any other level of football, and the coin toss remains the standard.

==Famous fumbles==
Fumbles have sometimes played a role in deciding games. Some of these have been so unique as to not only earn their own distinctive sobriquets, but to change the way the game has been played afterwards.

===College football===
* The Fumblerooski

===NFL===
* The Holy Roller: The Oakland Raiders won a September 10, 1978, contest against divisional rivals the San Diego Chargers through another intentional fumble. With ten seconds left, down 20–14, quarterback Ken Stabler fumbled the ball forward to avoid being sacked at the Chargers&#x27; 15-yard line. Two other players, Pete Banaszak and Dave Casper, attempted to recover it but batted it forward when they could not. Finally it reached the end zone, where Casper fell on it for the tying touchdown, which cleared the way for the extra point that gave the Raiders the win. Officials decided to allow the touchdown on the grounds that the fumbles did not appear to be intentional and thus could not be considered forward passes, but Stabler freely admitted his was. Chargers fans have referred to the play as the Immaculate Deception ever since, and after the 1978 season, the NFL instituted the current rule that a forward fumble in the last two minutes of play (or on fourth down) can only be advanced, if recovered by the fumbling team, by the player who originally fumbled.
* The Miracle at the Meadowlands: Later that season, on November 19, 1978, the New York Giants were closing out an apparent 17–12 victory over the visiting Philadelphia Eagles. With 31 seconds left to play, they had the ball on third down. The Eagles had no timeouts left. All the Giants had to do was snap the ball one more time, and since they had knelt with the ball on the play before, it was expected they would do it and the game would be over. However, the kneel-down play was not universally accepted as an honorable way to win a game at the time, and Giants&#x27; offensive coordinator Bob Gibson ordered quarterback Joe Pisarcik (with whom he had been having a running feud over play-calling authority) to hand the ball off to fullback Larry Csonka for one more run up the middle to end the game. Csonka was reluctant to take the ball, and instead Pisarcik fumbled the handoff, allowing Eagles&#x27; cornerback Herman Edwards to return it for the winning touchdown. The Fumble, as outraged Giants&#x27; fans still call it, spurred the Eagles to the playoffs that season and precipitated a complete overhaul of the Giants&#x27; coaching and management staff, eventually reversing years of decline. Gibson was fired the next day. The following week, kneeling with the ball when possible to run out the clock and preserve a victory became standard operating procedure in the NFL.
* The Fumble: The dubious honor of having committed &quot;The&quot; fumble goes to Earnest Byner of the Cleveland Browns. On January 17, 1988, he lost the ball just short of the Denver Broncos&#x27; goal line with 65 seconds left in the AFC championship game. He appeared to be on his way to a certain touchdown until Jeremiah Castille barely managed to reach out and jar the ball loose from his grip. The touchdown-that-wasn&#x27;t would have tied the game (assuming a made extra point) and kept alive the Browns&#x27; Super Bowl hopes. Instead, the Broncos spotted them a safety and the game ended in a 38-33 Broncos victory. The play has entered Cleveland sports lore as one of several instances in which the city&#x27;s teams were frustrated at the last minute on the way to possible future glory.
* Super Bowl XXVII: Leon Lett&#x27;s loss of the ball on the way to an apparent touchdown late in the game has gone down in football history as one of the most preventable fumbles. The Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle had recovered one of the Bills&#x27; record-setting five lost fumbles in late in the game and had slowed down as he approached the goal line, waving his arms out to his side in celebration. Buffalo Bills wide receiver Don Beebe, who had sprinted down the field unseen by Lett, caught up inside the 5 yard line and was able to knock the ball loose from behind. The ball subsequently rolled out of the end zone for a touchback, giving the ball back to the Bills. Beebe&#x27;s team by that point had no chance to win, but Lett&#x27;s premature showboating prevented the Cowboys from setting a new record for most points scored by one team in a Super Bowl. Despite an otherwise commendable career, that play and Lett&#x27;s later unnecessary attempt to recover a blocked field goal, which cost Dallas the next season&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day game, have led to him being ill-remembered by football fans.
* Romo&#x27;s fumbled hold: In the 2006–07 NFL playoffs Wild Card round versus the Seattle Seahawks, Dallas Cowboys quarterback and kick holder Tony Romo dropped the ball as kicker Martín Gramática was set to kick a go-ahead 19-yard field goal. Romo recovered his fumble and attempted to run the ball in for a touchdown or a first down, but was tackled inches short of the first down marker by Jordan Babineaux, allowing the Seahawks to run the clock out and win the game. Since this game, a common stereotype has been used to paint Romo as a &quot;choker&quot; in big moments by detractors with this particular incident as the most common example.
* The butt fumble: On November 22, 2012, during the primetime Thanksgiving Day game between the New York Jets and New England Patriots, Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez slipped and collided with the backside of his teammate Brandon Moore and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by the Patriots&#x27; Steve Gregory and returned for a touchdown. Adding insult to injury, the Jets&#x27; Joe McKnight fumbled the ensuing kickoff, which Julian Edelman recovered and returned for another Patriots touchdown.

===Professional Canadian football===
* In the fourth quarter of the 42nd Grey Cup game in 1954, Chuck Hunsinger of the Montreal Alouettes lost the ball on the Edmonton Eskimos&#x27; 15-yard line. Edmonton&#x27;s Jackie Parker recovered the bouncing ball on the 20 and ran 90 yards for what would prove to be the game-winning touchdown. Generations of fans, reviewing the film, have disagreed on whether Hunsinger fumbled or attempted a forward pass to an ineligible receiver.
* In the 105th Grey Cup in 2017, the Toronto Argonauts&#x27; Cassius Vaughn capitalized on a Calgary Stampeders fumble by Kamar Jorden at the Toronto nine-yard line and returned the ball for a Grey Cup-record-setting 109 yards for a touchdown. The two-point convert tied the game up 24–24 with under five minutes to play in regulation, and Toronto went on to win 27–24.

==In statistics==
Game box scores commonly record how many fumbles a team made and how many it recovered. A fumble is credited to the last player who handled it from the possessing team, regardless of whether it may have been his fault or not.

<doc id="98553" wikidata="Q2034529" url="?curid=98553" title="Red Skull">
<text>The Red Skull is the alias of several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by France Herron, Jack Kirby, and Joe Simon, the character first appeared in &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1 (March 1941), in which his secret identity is revealed to be George Maxon, but would later be retroactively established as merely a decoy who was working for the real Red Skull, Johann Shmidt. Other individuals, including Albert Malik and Shmidt&#x27;s own daughter [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sinthea]], have also adopted the Red Skull persona.

In his comic book appearances, the Red Skull is depicted as a Nazi agent and protégé of Adolf Hitler during World War II. Although he initially only wears a mask to give his face the appearance of a red skull, Shmidt suffers a horrific disfigurement decades later that causes his face to match his namesake. The Red Skull has endured as the archenemy of the superhero Captain America.

The Red Skull has been adapted in various media incarnations. Scott Paulin portrayed the character in the 1990 direct-to-video film &quot;Captain America&quot;. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hugo Weaving portrayed the Red Skull in &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011), and was then replaced by Ross Marquand in &quot;&quot; (2018) and &quot;&quot; (2019). Peter Cullen, Steve Blum, Liam O&#x27;Brien and others have provided the character&#x27;s voice in media ranging from animation to video games.

==Publication history==
The original Red Skull was introduced in Timely Comics&#x27; &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated March 1941) which was written and drawn by the team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. On separate occasions, both Kirby and Simon claimed to have had the original idea for the character, and at the 1970 San Diego Comic Con, Kirby said the Red Skull was created by France Herron. Simon later credited both Kirby and Herron with having a role in creating Red Skull.

===Golden age===
The Skull made limited appearances in the Golden Age of Captain America. His first story in &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1 follows the Red Skull as he takes out military personnel in attempts to sabotage United States military industry. In the issue, his identity is revealed as George Maxon of Maxon Aircraft, and dies at the end of the issue by rolling onto his own hypodermic needle in apparent suicide.

The Skull returns again in issue #3 of Captain America Comics having survived his own needle. He commandeers bank robberies in an effort to raise money to overthrow the US government, declaring, &quot;Of course you realize the main item in overthrowing the government is money!&quot; The Skull again assumedly dies at the end of the issue when Captain America returns a thrown bomb.

The Red Skull once again thwarts death by returning and planning crimes around music in Captain America Comics #7 (October 1941). Stories published decades later claimed this was the Nazi Johann Shmidt, and that the Red Skull appearing before that point was his pawn George Maxon. Marvel has since revealed Johann Shmidt&#x27;s first appearance was also in Captain America Comics #1, and the two skulls worked together in the Golden Age.

The Red Skull made sporadic appearances in other Timely comic books in the forties. He appeared in &quot;Young Allies&quot; #1 and #4. appearing maskless in both issues, including when getting up from bed in issue #1 and while in a fighter jet with one other ally in #4. He was also to appear in All-Select Comics #2 (December 1943), Captain America Comics #37 (February 1944) and &quot;All Winners Comics&quot; #12 (April 1944) in various plots to overthrow the United States.

In the last issue of Captain America Comics in the forties, which had since been retitled Captain America&#x27;s Weird Tales, Red Skull appears in a dream of Captain America, and they both battle in Hell for the damnation of each other&#x27;s soul. This story was notable for including horror aspects in Captain America stories, as horror comics books became popular during this time period. Timely would end the run of Captain America after this issue to focus on mystery, humor, and horror.

After an absence from comics for five years, both Captain America and the Red Skull were brought back in 1954 in &quot;Young Men Comics&quot; #24, in a story entitled &quot;Back From The Dead&quot;. Here the Red Skull, thinking Captain America was dead, has left politics and started a big criminal enterprise in the United States. In his next appearance, in issue #27, the Red Skull is once again left for dead from a truck crash.

===Silver age===
After an absence for more than a decade, the character of Red Skull returned in new stories starting with &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #65 (May 1965) in a Captain America World War II-period story run. Marvel resorted to retroactive continuity in recreating the identify of the Red Skull for the Silver age, explaining the real George &quot;John&quot; Maxon was killed and replaced with a lookalike who worked for the real Red Skull. In traveling to Germany to seek out the real Red Skull, Captain America finally meets Johann Shmidt face to face.

Red Skull was established as a contemporary villain in Tales of Suspense #79 (July 1966), with the explanation that he had been in suspended animation since World War II. He would continue to appear in this title after Tales of Suspense was renamed Captain America in 1968 with Marvel establishing the character as the archenemy of Captain America for a new age of readers.

===Bronze age===
During Jack Kirby&#x27;s return to Marvel in 1976, the Red Skull would again appear in a run of Captain America during which Kirby both wrote and penciled stories of the characters he helped create. During this run, it is notable Red Skull was the only villain Kirby brought back, having distanced these new Captain America stories from the rest of the Marvel Universe. During this period, the Red Skull would also be used as an antagonist in the &quot;Invaders&quot; comic book series which focused on period stories from the forties.

For decades, the character&#x27;s true face was hidden, but in &quot;Captain America&quot; #297 (September 1984) the Red Skull unmasks in front of Captain America and his face, albeit extremely aged, is fully revealed. In the next issue, the Red Skull retells his story with his face fully visible in his various ages. The Red Skull seemingly dies in issue #300 (December 1984) after a battle with Captain America and would disappear for five years. When the character is revealed to be alive in issue #350 (February 1989), in a story called &quot;Resurrection&quot;, by Mark Gruenwald, the face of Johann Shmidt&#x27;s original body is hidden again, but the Red Skull&#x27;s face is fully visible, albeit in his cloned copy of Captain America&#x27;s body.

The character&#x27;s origin was more fully illustrated in the miniseries &quot;Red Skull: Incarnate&quot;, with Shmidt&#x27;s face fully visible again.

==Fictional character biography==
===Johann Shmidt===
Johann Shmidt was a Nazi general officer and confidant of Adolf Hitler. He has been closely affiliated with HYDRA and is an enemy of S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers, and the interests of the United States and the free world in general. He was physically augmented by having his mind placed into the body of a clone of Captain America, the pinnacle of human perfection. He has been seemingly killed in the past, only to return time and time again to plague the world with schemes of world domination and genocide.

Johann Shmidt was born in a village in Germany to Hermann Shmidt and Martha Shmidt. His mother died in childbirth, and his father blamed Johann for her death. Johann&#x27;s father tried to drown the baby, only to be stopped by the attending doctor; he later committed suicide, leaving Johann an orphan. The doctor took Johann to an orphanage, where the child led a lonely existence. Johann ran away from the orphanage when he was 7 years old and lived on the streets as a beggar and thief. As he grew older, he worked at various menial jobs but spent most of his time in prison for crimes ranging from vagrancy to theft. The Skull&#x27;s real name of Johann Shmidt was not revealed in his Golden Age and Silver Age appearances. As a young man, Shmidt was from time to time employed by a Jewish shopkeeper, whose daughter Esther was the only person who had treated Shmidt kindly up to that point. Seized with passion for Esther, Schmidt tried to force himself upon her, only for her to reject him. In unthinking fury, Shmidt murdered her. Shmidt fled the scene in terror but also felt ecstatic joy in committing his first murder. In killing Esther, he had given vent to the rage at the world that had been building up in him throughout his young life.

According to the official version of the story told by the Red Skull and the Nazis, Shmidt met Hitler while working as a bellhop in a hotel. This occurred during his late teens, around the same time that the Nazi Party gained power in Germany. Shmidt wound up serving Hitler&#x27;s rooms at the hotel. By chance, Shmidt was present by bringing refreshments when the Führer was furiously scolding an officer for letting a spy escape, during which Hitler declared that he could create a better National Socialist out of the bellhop. Looking closely at the youth and sensing his dark inner nature, Hitler decided to act on his words and recruited Shmidt. In the miniseries &quot;Red Skull: Incarnate&quot;, it has been revealed that Shmidt actually engineered his meeting with the Führer with himself disguised as a bellhop, tricking his fellow orphan Dieter into trying to kill Hitler and then taking this opportunity to save Hitler&#x27;s life.

Dissatisfied with the standard drill instruction his subordinates used to train Shmidt, Hitler took over personally, training Shmidt as his right-hand man after Heinrich Himmler. Upon completion, Hitler gave Shmidt a unique uniform with a grotesque red skull mask, and he emerged as the Red Skull (in literal German: &quot;Roter Totenkopf&quot; or &quot;Roter (Toten-)Schädel&quot;) for the first time. His role was the embodiment of Nazi intimidation, while Hitler could remain the popular leader of Germany. To that end, the Red Skull was appointed head of Nazi terrorist activities with an additional large role in external espionage and sabotage. He succeeded, wreaking havoc throughout Europe in the early stages of World War II. The propaganda effect was so great that the United States government decided to counter it by creating their own equivalent using the one recipient of the lost Project Rebirth: Steve Rogers, as the superhero/counterintelligence agent, Captain America.

In Europe during the war, the Red Skull took personal command of many military actions and personally supervised the takeovers and lootings of many cities and towns. The Red Skull also organized a Wolf Pack of U-boats which preyed upon shipping across the world, often under the Red Skull&#x27;s personal command. At first, Hitler took great pride in the successes of his protégé and let the Red Skull have anything he wanted. Hitler thus financed the construction of secret bases for the Red Skull in various locations throughout the world, many of which were equipped with highly advanced experimental weapons and devices developed by Nazi scientists. The Red Skull was particularly interested in procuring technological weapons that could be used for the purposes of subversion and warfare. During the war he stole plans for the nullatron, a device that could control human minds, adapted a space-warping device developed by the cyborg scientist code-named Brain Drain, and commissioned Nazi scientists to develop a projector which could encircle and suspend sections of cities within spheres of energy. But while the Red Skull always admired Hitler for his ideological vision, he was never fully content with being Hitler&#x27;s subordinate. The Red Skull kidnapped and killed many of Hitler&#x27;s closest advisers and eventually rose to become the second-most-powerful man in Nazi Germany. Now Hitler could no longer effectively control the Red Skull and came to fear him, especially since the Red Skull had made no secret of his ambition to supplant Hitler someday. Captain America, often with teenage partner Bucky Barnes, fought and thwarted the Red Skull many times during the war. The heroes also fought the Red Skull when they were members of the Invaders. On one occasion the Red Skull captured, drugged, and brainwashed Captain America. He sent the hero to kill a high-ranking officer, but with Bucky&#x27;s help Captain America broke free. The Red Skull later temporarily brainwashed three of the Invaders into serving him. The Red Skull and Captain America continued to engage in a series of skirmishes throughout the war.

After the renowned military officer Baron Wolfgang von Strucker had a falling-out with Hitler, the Red Skull sent Strucker to Japan to found an organization that would prepare the way for takeovers in the Far East under the Red Skull&#x27;s leadership. In the Far East, Strucker joined a subversive organization that came to be known as HYDRA, severed his ties with the Red Skull, became head of HYDRA and made it into a major threat to world peace.

As World War II raged on, Hitler vowed that if he could not conquer the world, he would destroy it. To achieve this end, the Red Skull proposed the construction of five gigantic war machines, to be called the Sleepers, which would be hidden in various locations while they generated and stored the power they would need, and then be released at a future date, &quot;Der Tag&quot; (&quot;The Day&quot; in German), to destroy the Earth if the Allies won the war. Hitler enthusiastically instructed the Red Skull to construct the Sleepers, unaware that the Red Skull intended to use them to conquer the world himself if Nazi Germany fell. In the closing days of the war in Europe, Allied intelligence received reports of a Nazi doomsday plan, code-named &quot;Der Tag&quot;, to be implemented after Hitler&#x27;s defeat. However, the Allies had no idea what the plan entailed. The Red Skull sent a number of his subordinates who became known as the Exiles, and a large contingent of loyal German soldiers and their wives to a secret island base (&quot;Exile Island&quot;), where they would organize an army for use in the future.

Now that the German defeat was becoming a reality, the Red Skull was more determined than ever to obtain vengeance for his numerous personal defeats by Captain America and Bucky. The Red Skull assigned Baron Heinrich Zemo to go to England, and, under the cover of stealing an experimental Allied drone plane, to capture or kill Captain America and Bucky. However, the Red Skull was unaware that the Allies had just secretly parachuted Captain America into beleaguered Berlin to investigate &quot;Der Tag&quot;. Finally, Captain America tracked the Red Skull down to his hidden bunker. The Red Skull was about to hurl an armed hand grenade at his nemesis when Captain America threw his shield at him. The grenade exploded, but the Red Skull was not killed, due to his body armor. He was, however, seriously hurt and partially buried in debris. Thinking he was dying, the Red Skull defiantly told Captain America that the Sleepers would avenge the Nazis&#x27; defeat. Then, suddenly, an Allied attack on Berlin began. An Allied plane dropped a huge blockbuster bomb on the bunker, causing a cave-in that Captain America barely escaped. Captain America was picked up by the Allies and returned to England only to fall into Zemo&#x27;s trap, which led to Bucky&#x27;s supposed death and Captain America&#x27;s falling into suspended animation for decades. Support pillars that crisscrossed over the Red Skull when the bunker caved in saved him from being struck by tons of rubble when the bomb hit. The cave-in also released an experimental gas from canisters in the bunker which put the Red Skull into suspended animation, during which time his wounds slowly healed.
Johann Shmidt&#x27;s legacy continued to cause trouble by way of the Sleepers which are activated by his agents as scheduled. Captain America neutralizes all the machines in turn.

Johann Shmidt is eventually rescued and revived from suspended animation in modern times by the terrorist organization A.I.M. The Red Skull quickly subverts a cell to his own ambitions of world conquest and the death of Captain America. He steals the Cosmic Cube after taking control of its Keeper&#x27;s mind with a device he planted while shaking hands, and reveals that he ordered Baron Zemo to steal the bomb plane that led to Bucky Barnes&#x27;s death. He had a rivalry with Zemo, and hoped to set his two foes against each other. Captain America learns, from the dying pilot of a plane that had been following the Keeper&#x27;s plane, that the Cosmic Cube had been used to destroy the plane. Shmidt tells another A.I.M. member of his plans after getting a mind control device on him, then causes him to shoot himself. He fights Captain America again for the first time in years after getting the Cosmic Cube on an island. He begins sending Captain America to another dimension when Captain America offers to become his servant. The Red Skull encases himself in a golden suit of armor, and talks of creating a new order of knights. Captain America gets close to him while the Red Skull prepares to knight him. Captain America tries to get the Cosmic Cube, and in the fight the island splits apart from the Cosmic Cube&#x27;s power, and the Red Skull falls off a cliff while trying to get the Cosmic Cube. When Johann reappears, he and Albert Malik start to antagonize each other while both claiming the Red Skull identity. Finally Malik is the victim of an assassination organized by the Red Skull, through a rogue agent of the Scourges of the Underworld.

The Red Skull captures part of Manhattan Island, unleashes the fourth Sleeper, and captures Captain America on Exile Island. The Red Skull then regains the Cosmic Cube and temporarily switches bodies with Captain America. He also uses the Cube to alter the personality of Sam &quot;Snap&quot; Wilson. Some time later in his first appearance outside of a title featuring Captain America, he fights Doctor Doom. The Red Skull then foments racial hatred in New York, and is revealed as the true power behind a Las Vegas-based HYDRA fragment, and clashes with Kingpin.

Some time later, the Red Skull kills Roscoe (another wearer of the Captain America mantle). He also revives the use of his &quot;dust of death&quot;. The Red Skull later fights Doctor Doom on the moon, but is defeated. With Arnim Zola, the Red Skull seeks to transplant Hitler&#x27;s brain into Captain America&#x27;s body. He transforms a number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into his red skull-faced slaves. The Red Skull teams with the Hate-Monger (a clone of Hitler) and traps him in a flawed Cosmic Cube. The Red Skull leads the Nihilist Order for a brief time. Establishing a Nazi colony on a deserted island, the Red Skull fathers a daughter: Synthia Schmidt.

The gas that placed the Red Skull in suspended animation wears off and his body rapidly ages to his actual years. Now physically weak and feeble in his mid-80s, the Red Skull plans a final showdown with his archrival. Kidnapping Captain America&#x27;s closest allies, he forces Captain America to surrender himself to a medical treatment that ages his body to its rightful age. The two men, their bodies now ancient, fight a battle to the death. When Captain America refuses to kill him, the Red Skull dies in Captain America&#x27;s arms, cursing his enemy as his elderly body shuts down.

Nazi geneticist Arnim Zola had obtained DNA samples of Captain America years earlier and arranged for the Red Skull&#x27;s mind to be transplanted into a cloned body of Captain America at the moment of his death. Assuming the identity of &quot;John Smith&quot; (the English equivalent of his natural German name), the Red Skull decides to reinvent himself and his quest for absolute power as a means to celebrate his cheating death. The Red Skull abandons his longstanding beliefs in National Socialism and Hitler, on the belief that the Nazi philosophy made him look like a relic of the past, and turns towards American ideology. The Red Skull sees much potential in the American dream of capitalism and self-determination and sets about establishing his own foothold inside Washington, D.C., culminating in him gaining control over the Commission on Superhuman Activities, a government body in Washington that monitors and regulates superhero activities.

The Red Skull also changes his mode of operations: rather than &quot;living from one grand scheme to the next&quot;, he begins financing a score of evil organizations that report directly to him, such as the militia group the Watchdogs. He also employs one of the Scourges of the Underworld, an organization dedicated to killing supervillains.

The Red Skull has the Commission remove Steve Rogers from the position of Captain America and replace him with jingoist John Walker. Although Walker attempts to live up to his predecessor&#x27;s ideals, the Red Skull arranges for the murders of Walker&#x27;s parents, driving him insane and into a downward spiral of murder as part of his plan to blacken the name of Captain America.

The Red Skull kills his chief pawn in the Commission right in front of Captain America. About to be exposed, the Red Skull tries to manipulate Walker into killing Rogers. When Rogers defeats Walker, the Red Skull appears to gloat at what he had done to Rogers, Walker, and the reputation of Captain America. However, Rogers remains openly dubious of his claims to be his dead archenemy. The Red Skull tries to kill Rogers with a cigarette holding a lethal dose of the dust of death (the Red Skull&#x27;s favorite poison), but Walker hits him from behind with his shield. The Red Skull inhales the dust of death and his face takes on the appearance of a living red skull; his head loses its hair and its skin shrivels, clinging tightly to his skull, and taking on a red discoloration. The Red Skull survives the exposure due to the effects of the Super-Soldier Formula.

After this, the Red Skull masterminds a conflict between the United States and Symkaria. He joins the &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; conspiracy, but is attacked by the mutant terrorist Magneto, a Holocaust survivor who wants to punish him for his involvement in Hitler&#x27;s regime. Magneto buries him alive with enough water to last a few months. The Red Skull remains imprisoned, close to death and beginning to see the error of his ways, until he is rescued by his henchman Crossbones. Feeling ready to die in peace, the Red Skull requests to be taken to his private estate&#x27;s bed, and for Captain America to come see him. Upon seeing his archenemy&#x27;s face, the Red Skull is surprised to feel a sudden burst of hatred that reignites his will to live.

The Red Skull proposes an alliance with the Kingpin to bring a new designer drug to New York, but the Kingpin refuses to ally with the Nazi and the two engage in a drug war. He then defeats the Red Skull in hand-to-hand combat, sparing his life on the condition that he never come near the Kingpin&#x27;s territory again. After the Red Skull&#x27;s agents allow fellow Nazi Baron Wolfgang von Strucker to be reborn, the grateful Strucker allows the Red Skull the use of HYDRA resources.

The Red Skull&#x27;s tenure in Washington comes to an end when he is captured by Hauptmann Deutschland, and taken to Germany to stand trial for crimes against humanity, stemming from his days as a Nazi agent. The Red Skull narrowly escapes and is rescued by Arnim Zola, and forced to fake his death and go into hiding in a Rocky Mountain compound. He recruits the Viper, a move that alienates his minions and is further rocked when his chief henchman Crossbones kidnaps Captain America&#x27;s girlfriend Diamondback, resulting in Captain America finding the Red Skull&#x27;s new lair. The Red Skull fires Crossbones and goes into hiding while the Viper, using funds she plied from the Red Skull as part of a scheme to use televisions across America to blind TV viewers, is defeated by Captain America.

The Red Skull discovers that he is facing the same permanent paralysis that Captain America was facing due to their exposure to the Super-Soldier Formula. When the evil scientist Superia offers Captain America a cure, Captain America refuses it because Superia said that Captain America would owe her. The Red Skull takes the cure and apparently kills Superia, then arranges for Captain America to be kidnapped by his remaining forces (including Sharon Carter, whom he found still alive and recruits), and given a blood transfusion that cures him.

Captain America&#x27;s recovery segues into a reluctant team-up with the Red Skull; a Nazi cult that worshiped Hitler as a god had discovered a Cosmic Cube that contained Hitler&#x27;s soul, put there by the Red Skull himself. The two try to stop the cult from fully powering the Hitler Cosmic Cube, but the Red Skull opts instead to send Captain America (against his will) into the cube to kill Hitler, imprisoning Captain America in the cube while he uses its power to conquer humanity. Captain America escapes and uses his shield to sever one of the Red Skull&#x27;s arms, causing him to drop the Cube. The Cube becomes unstable, destroying the Red Skull.

Trapped in a hellish nightmare dimension and forced to serve as a bellhop to a world of non-European immigrants, the Red Skull&#x27;s will ultimately is so great that he is able to escape his prison. As a result, the Red Skull now possesses limited reality-warping powers that make him a cosmic threat. He is further aided by Korvac, posing as Kang the Conqueror. He is sent to Galactus&#x27;s ship to steal more power (particularly the power of omniscience), which would remove all limits to the Red Skull&#x27;s reality-warping powers. The Red Skull is ambushed by Korvac, who steals his cosmic powers and banishes him back to Earth.

The Red Skull later manipulates his way into the position in the form of US Secretary of Defense Dell Rusk (an anagram of &quot;Red Skull&quot;) to develop a biological weapon called &quot;Project Bloodwash&quot; he tested at Mount Rushmore. He is exposed and defeated by the Avengers, where the Black Panther beats him so badly that he breaks the Red Skull&#x27;s jaw in half.
The Red Skull was assassinated by the mysterious Winter Soldier, under orders from the renegade former Soviet general Aleksander Lukin wanting to possess the new Cosmic Cube the Red Skull had manufactured. When the Red Skull was shot, he attempted to use the Cosmic Cube to switch bodies with Lukin to survive, but as the Cosmic Cube was still weak he only managed to transfer his mind into Lukin&#x27;s body, so that the two enemies are trapped together, waging a constant war for dominance which the Red Skull seems to be progressively winning. During a plot to lure out Captain America, the Red Skull/Lukin recruited several German skinheads and made them the successors to Master Man. He then had these soldiers, dubbed the &quot;Master Race&quot;, launch an attack on London, which was thwarted by Captain America, Spitfire and Union Jack. Then, the Red Skull/Lukin activated a Sleeper, a robot programmed for mass destruction that was presumably created by Doctor Doom. The robot damaged a significant portion of the new London Kronas H.Q., and was ultimately destroyed by Captain America and Bucky. In the aftermath, the Red Skull sent a videotape, announcing to the world his return, followed by Lukin holding a press conference condemning the actions of both the Red Skull and Captain America, and supporting the Superhero Registration Act. Then, in his office, the Red Skull introduced Lukin to his old/new associates Crossbones and Sin.

With America&#x27;s superheroes divided over the act, the Red Skull manipulates events to his own ends, with the aid of Doctor Faustus, Doctor Doom and Arnim Zola. His plans involved the reunion of Captain America and his former lover Sharon Carter being manipulated by Faustus.

In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, the Red Skull puts his plans into action, arranging for Crossbones to shoot Captain America as he enters a courthouse in New York City; in the ensuing chaos, Carter, acting under Faustus&#x27;s mental directive, assassinates Captain America. This is only the first phase of the Red Skull&#x27;s plan. Upon the discovery of his identity as Lukin, the Red Skull fakes his death, and initiates the second phase of his plan: using the Kronas Corporation&#x27;s vast holdings to economically cripple the United States, before having S.H.I.E.L.D. agents brainwashed by Doctor Faustus open fire on crowds of protesters in front of the White House. The Red Skull continues his assault by engineering a riot by placing Kronas security troops and drugged water in a protest on the Lincoln Memorial.

All of this has apparently been to elevate his puppet politician, Gordon Wright, elevated in the public&#x27;s eye with being credited as &quot;resolving&quot; the situations, as well as surviving a (staged) attack by the Serpent Squad. Once elected, Wright will lead the country directly into a police state secretly controlled by the Red Skull. The Red Skull also plans to transfer his consciousness into Sharon&#x27;s unborn child, apparently sired by Steve Rogers himself and potentially having inherited his Project: Rebirth enhancements.

Both schemes fail because of the impatience and incompetence of the Red Skull&#x27;s daughter—her near-fatal attack on Sharon causes her to lose the baby, and she intentionally botches her pseudo-assassination of Wright by attempting to kill him for real. As Faustus has surreptitiously tampered with Sharon&#x27;s programming, she is able to rebel, and before escaping shoots Lukin to death. This is not the end of the Red Skull, since Zola had seconds earlier transferred his mind to one of the spare robotic bodies, but after having his current form damaged by the impostor Captain America, he is unable to return to the Red Skull, trapping him in his robotic form.

It has been revealed that the Red Skull did not kill Steve Rogers, but trapped his body in a fixed position in space and time. He was planning on using Sharon Carter and a machine created by Doctor Doom to return his body back to their time, but since Sharon destroyed the machine, his body is now drifting through time and space. Apparently, it is presumed that the Red Skull intended to transfer his mind into Rogers&#x27; body. Norman Osborn decides to assist in completing his plan, as a figurehead of Captain America leading his team of Avengers would increase popularity with as the Iron Patriot. Sin and Crossbones find him and take him to Latveria to place the Red Skull&#x27;s mind in a living body. The Red Skull, Sin and Crossbones land in Latveria and Doctor Doom confronts them, saying that he would kill them if he was not a man of his word. Doctor Doom and Zola complete the machine and, after Victoria Hand brings Sharon to them, they strap her in. They activate the machine and soon Steve&#x27;s body returns. When Steve opens his eyes, they are shown to be red, signifying that the Red Skull is now in control. Rogers still resides in the body and during the Red Skull&#x27;s invasion of Washington, D.C., he and Steve battle in the mind of Steve&#x27;s body. Steve eventually forces the Red Skull out, placing him back into his robot body. To prevent him from escaping the immediate area, Sharon hits the Red Skull with a shot of Pym particles, making him a massive robot who cannot elude any pursuer&#x27;s attention. While Rogers and the Avengers keep the Red Skull occupied with a team attack, he is destroyed by a missile barrage fired by Sharon on a hijacked A.I.M. battleship.

After Lukin was brought back from the dead by the Power Elite, a side effect has a fragment of the original Red Skull&#x27;s mind also revived.

After he was revived, Red Skull worked to rebuild his empire. This led him into conflict with the Thunderbolts where they find him hiding out in Latveria. Despite an attempt to use American Kaiju on the Thunderbolts, Red Skull was attacked by the Avengers which ended with Red Skull being killed by Doctor Doom.

During the &quot;One World Under Doom&quot; storyline, Doctor Doom confirmed his reason for killing Red Skull and Baron Helmut Zemo because they are associated with the Nazis and that the Nazis used Hydra to do their dirty work.

===Other identity users===
There had been other people who passed themselves off as the Red Skull:

====George John Maxon====

Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, George John Maxon appeared as Red Skull in &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #1 and #3 (March–May 1941). He faces Captain America during two of the latter&#x27;s early missions. Maxon is an American businessman and Nazi agent who leads a ring of spies and saboteurs and serves as a stand-in of Johann Schmidt (the true Red Skull). Maxon is thought killed during the second encounter, though he would reappear for one last encounter with Captain America.

====Albert Malik====
After the disappearance of Johann Schmidt in 1945, the reputation of the Red Skull was still formidable enough to prove useful. In 1953, Soviet Russian KGB agent Albert Malik set up his spy/criminal organization in Algeria and assumed the Red Skull identity (), pretending that he was the original, when he was actually serving Soviet interests, in &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #61. During the 1950s, he faced the then-active version of Captain America, who was also pretending to be the original. While the Captain and Bucky (Jack Monroe) were placed into suspended animation when his flawed replicate of the Super-Soldier Formula seriously affected his and Bucky&#x27;s minds, Malik continued his activities, and over time severed his links to the Soviet Union.

He was also responsible for the deaths of Richard and Mary Parker, the parents of Peter Parker, tipped off by the supercriminal Gustav &quot;the Gentleman&quot; Fiers to their spy status.

Malik was later killed by a Scourge of the Underworld, operating on behalf of the original Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) disguised as a pilot.

====Sinthea Shmidt====

Sinthea &quot;Sin&quot; Shmidt is the daughter of Johann Shmidt who briefly adopts the Red Skull moniker after being scarred like her father.

====Clone of Johann Shmidt====
Following the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, the Red Skull mysteriously returns and assembles a team called the S-Men. The Red Skull&#x27;s S-Men attack Rogue and the Scarlet Witch at Professor X&#x27;s grave and steal the mutant&#x27;s body. In his hideout, the Red Skull is then seen removing Professor X&#x27;s brain in a plot to &quot;eradicate the mutant menace&quot;. This Red Skull is revealed to be a clone of the original created by Arnim Zola in 1942 and held in cryogenic stasis in the event that Germany lost the war. Fusing part of Professor X&#x27;s brain with his own, the Red Skull brainwashes the Scarlet Witch as part of a plot to wipe out the world&#x27;s mutant population. Rogue attacks the Scarlet Witch and they fight until they both discover the lobotomized body of Professor X. The Red Skull arrives and reveals that he has fused his brain with Professor X&#x27;s brain. Using Professor X&#x27;s telepathy, the Red Skull provokes ordinary citizens of New York into a mass assault against even potential mutants, even managing to take control of Thor. However, his telepathy is still erratic, with the Red Skull being unable to completely control Captain America and an attack against him by Wolverine cutting off his right hand and disrupting his powers long enough for Rogue and the Scarlet Witch to break free. The team ultimately force the Red Skull to retreat after Rogue manages to temporarily disrupt his powers, Havok mockingly comparing the Red Skull to the jock who beats up gay kids to conceal his own homosexuality.

During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Magneto finds out that the Red Skull has turned Genosha into a concentration camp for mutants and still has Professor X&#x27;s brain inside him. Magneto attacks the Red Skull, but is quickly stopped by the S-Men. The Red Skull mind-tortures Magneto with visions of those closest to the mutant suffering while being unable to do anything to stop it. After being freed by the Scarlet Witch, Rogue and Havok, he bites down on a vial beneath his skin of Mutant Growth Hormone, giving himself enough power to fight. When the Scarlet Witch, Rogue and Havok want to leave the island and alert the rest of the Avengers and the X-Men of what the Red Skull is doing, Magneto wants to stay and fight. Before they can do anything, the Red Skull appears. The Red Skull now has the group mind-controlled. He plans on using the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s power to shape reality in his image. He tells Magneto to bow if the Scarlet Witch were to remain alive, but Magneto performs a sneak attack enough to break the Red Skull&#x27;s control over the others. After killing the S-Men, Magneto attacks the Red Skull, who then tells Magneto that Professor X&#x27;s greatest fear was leading the X-Men. Magneto kills the Red Skull while the others look on in horror. Magneto believes everything is over, only for the Red Skull to appear as a giant called &quot;Red Onslaught&quot;.

In an attempt to defeat the new Red Onslaught and his army of Stark Sentinels—created from information acquired from Tony Stark during the time of the Superhuman Registration Act—Magneto gathers a team of villains to try to take the Red Skull&#x27;s forces by surprise. The Scarlet Witch attempts to cast a spell that will &#x27;invert&#x27; the Red Skull and bring out the part of Professor X that still exists in his brain. However, the plan backfires when the resulting spell causes the moral inversion of all heroes and villains in the area. With the villains now the only hope to defeat the corrupted heroes, Captain America is forced to protect the Red Skull (now calling himself the White Skull) from the evil Avengers while Spider-Man works with the inverted villains to fight off the various corrupted heroes. Doctor Doom is able to summon the spirit of Brother Voodoo to possess the Scarlet Witch and invert the spell, the Red Skull sacrificing his heroism and freedom to restore the heroes to normal. The Red Skull was later taken away by Doctor Doom.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, it is revealed that the Red Skull is hiding in Avengers Mansion (now a themed hotel as the various Avengers teams have moved on to new bases) in a secret underground room along with Sin (whose original appearance has been restored) ever since he was defeated. He is nearly discovered when Quicksilver and Deadpool investigate the room, but uses a psychic suggestion to convince them that the room is empty, as well as planting a command in Quicksilver&#x27;s subconscious that will be triggered later.

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, the Red Skull infiltrates the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility Pleasant Hill by disguising himself as a priest named Father Patrick. As Patrick, the Red Skull secretly instigates an uprising of the facility&#x27;s brainwashed inmates by manipulating Baron Helmut Zemo and the Fixer into restoring them to normal. In the aftermath of the battle with the villains at Pleasant Hill, the Red Skull founds his own version of HYDRA with Sin and Crossbones.

Their first strike occurs when they use Kobik—a sentient Cosmic Cube that once belonged to the Red Skull, now &#x27;educated&#x27; to perceive HYDRA as a great organization—to manipulate Steve Rogers&#x27;s memories into believing of being a HYDRA sleeper agent since childhood, although the Red Skull is unaware that the HYDRA-converted soldier now intends to stage a coup of the organization for his own ends.

The Red Skull eventually mounts an assault on the Avengers, using previously planted commands to take control of the team, but Deadpool is able to resist him long enough to place Magneto&#x27;s old helmet on Rogue&#x27;s head, rendering Rogue immune to telepathy long enough to knock the Red Skull out and take him to be operated on by Beast. The fragment of Professor X&#x27;s brain is extracted from the Red Skull, but although Rogers attempts to take custody of the fragment for his own ends, Rogue and Johnny Storm fly up and incinerate the brain fragment, leaving the Red Skull to be taken into &#x27;custody&#x27; by Rogers. Although Red Skull is rescued by Sin, she and Crossbones subsequently betray the Red Skull to prove loyalty to Rogers, who kills the clone for good by pushing him over the cliff outside the Red Skull&#x27;s mansion with Rogers revealing never being loyal to the Red Skull from the beginning.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, the disheveled man in a torn World War II uniform that introduced himself as Steve Rogers, alongside people claiming to be &quot;Bucky&quot; and &quot;Sam Wilson&quot;, encounters the Red Skull&#x27;s clone who plans to taken them &quot;home&quot;. As the other Steve Rogers is hanging from a rope tied to a tree, he finds himself next to a rambling man. As the Red Skull&#x27;s clone takes the rambling man away, he tells the other Steve Rogers that his time will come soon. The other Steve Rogers asks the Red Skull&#x27;s clone where he is and the Red Skull&#x27;s clone claims that they are in &quot;Hell&quot;. He also states that they are nothing but ghosts that are remnants fading into death. The Red Skull&#x27;s clone then uses a barbed bat on the other Steve Rogers&#x27; chest, stating that the only path to peace is death. The Red Skull&#x27;s clone is torturing the other Steve Rogers with a burning, thorn-wrapped piece of wood. The Red Skull&#x27;s clone claims he is granting the other Steve Rogers &quot;peace&quot; and is about to deliver the killing blow to the other Steve Rogers. Before he can strike, the other Steve Rogers sees the beautiful blond girl he saw at the beginning of the series who was the same one that was poisoned and that he thought had died. He realizes there is still hope and evades the Red Skull&#x27;s clone&#x27;s attack. The other Steve Rogers then tackles the Red Skull&#x27;s clone and they both plummet off the cliff into the water below. The Red Skull&#x27;s clone calls the other Steve Rogers an idiot for his actions.

==Powers and abilities==
Although he has no superhuman abilities, the Red Skull possesses a high intellect and inventive genius and is a highly gifted subversive strategist and political operative. At one point, the Red Skull&#x27;s mind inhabited a body cloned from Captain America&#x27;s DNA, which possessed the mutagenic alterations induced by the Super-Soldier Formula. He was thus endowed with a body that was in perfect physical condition, with strength, speed, durability, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, balance and physical endurance that exceeded that of an Olympic athlete. Despite the scar tissue covering his face and head, his senses were still above-average. He has been shown as a superb martial artist, though he was never on par with Captain America himself; he was originally trained by German athletes appointed by Hitler. He is heavily trained as a skilled marksman with various forms of handguns and well-versed in the use of firearms and explosives.

While sharing Alexander Lukin&#x27;s body, he lost his superhuman abilities. Since then, he resides in one of the android bodies engineered by Arnim Zola, with enhanced endurance and resilience.

He typically armed himself with a trick cigarette that could fire a fatal poison gas—his trademark &quot;dust of death&quot;—toward his victim. The &quot;dust of death&quot; is a red powder which kills a victim within seconds of skin contact. The powder causes the skin of the victim&#x27;s head to shrivel, tighten and take on a red discoloration, while causing all of his hair to fall out; hence the victim&#x27;s head resembles a &quot;red skull&quot;. He also carries a large arsenal of conventional and advanced firearms and explosives.

After fusing his own brain with that of Charles Xavier, the clone of the Red Skull gains powerful telepathic abilities. After being killed in a fight with Magneto, the Red Skull clone temporarily evolved into a psionic entity similar to Onslaught, vastly increasing his original powers while also giving him new ones, ranging from material astral projection, total control over his psionic state producing tendrils, changing size and such, energy projection in the form of optic blasts, on top of greatly enhanced control over his psychic abilities being able to effect minds the world over to initiate worldwide hate. After reverting to his original form, however, he later expressed frustration with this new power as it makes conquest too easy for him, realizing that he wants people to grovel before him of their own free will, rather than just making people mindlessly submit. The Red Skull eventually loses these abilities when he is captured by Rogue and taken to Beast, who performs surgery on the Red Skull to extract the elements of Xavier&#x27;s brain from his own.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===

The Johann Schmidt incarnation of the Red Skull appears in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU):

* He is introduced in the live-action film &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;, portrayed by Hugo Weaving. This version is the head of HYDRA, which originally served as the Nazis&#x27; deep-science division. Schmidt ordered Dr. Abraham Erskine to use an experimental formula on him, which physically enhanced but permanently disfigured him. As a result, Adolf Hitler nicknamed Schmidt the &quot;Red Skull&quot; and exiled him. While leading an incursion into Norway in 1942, Schmidt recovers the Tesseract and has his chief scientist Arnim Zola develop advanced weapons powered by the object. Disillusioned with the Nazis, Schmidt breaks away from their regime and establishes HYDRA as its own force against the Allies and Axis alike with aspirations of world dominion. However, Steve Rogers leads the Allies&#x27; fight against HYDRA, forcing the group to retreat to their final base in the Alps. In 1945, Schmidt launches his plan to destroy populated cities across the United States, only to be defeated by Rogers and seemingly disintegrated by the Tesseract while attempting to use it.
* Schmidt returns in the live-action film &quot;&quot;, portrayed by Ross Marquand. Following the events of &quot;The First Avenger&quot;, he was transported to the planet Vormir and forced to serve as a &quot;stonekeeper&quot;, guiding those who seek the Soul Stone as punishment for his use of the Tesseract. As the Soul Stone requires the sacrifice of a loved one, of which he had none, he was unable to claim it for himself. In 2018, Thanos and Gamora arrive on Vormir to claim the Soul Stone, which Schmidt directs them to. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo stated that, after Thanos claimed the Soul Stone, Schmidt was freed from his curse and permitted to leave Vormir and pursue his own desires. 
* An alternate timeline version of Schmidt appears in the live-action film &quot;&quot;, portrayed again by Marquand. He guides a time-traveling Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton to the Soul Stone.
* Alternate timeline variants of Schmidt appear in the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;, voiced by Marquand.
** In the episode &quot;What If... Captain Carter Were the First Avenger?&quot;, a variant of Schmidt attempts to achieve world domination via the Tesseract, but faces opposition from Captain Carter. His plans eventually culminate in him using the Tesseract to open a portal and summon an interdimensional creature, only for it to kill him.

<doc id="98555" wikidata="Q488299" url="?curid=98555" title="Oceanus Procellarum">
<text>Oceanus Procellarum ( ; from ) is a vast lunar mare on the western edge of the near side of the Moon. It is the only one of the lunar maria to be called an &quot;Oceanus&quot; (ocean), due to its size: Oceanus Procellarum is the largest of the maria (&quot;seas&quot;), stretching more than across its north–south axis and covering roughly , accounting for 10.5% of the total lunar surface area.

==Characteristics==
Like all lunar maria, Oceanus Procellarum was formed by ancient volcanic eruptions resulting in basaltic floods that covered the region in a thick, nearly flat layer of solidified magma. Basalts in Oceanus Procellarum have been estimated to be as young as one billion years old. Unlike the other lunar maria, however, Oceanus Procellarum may or may not be contained within a single, well-defined impact basin.

Around its edges lie many minor bays and seas, including Sinus Roris to the north, and Mare Nubium, Mare Humorum and to the south. To the northeast, Oceanus Procellarum is separated from Mare Imbrium by the Carpathian Mountains. On its north-west edge lies the 32 km wide Aristarchus ray crater, the brightest feature on the Near side of the Moon. Also, the more-prominent ray-crater Copernicus lies within the eastern edge of the mare, distinct with its bright ray materials sprawling over the darker material.

==Origin==

There are several hypotheses about the origin of Oceanus Procellarum and a related asymmetry between the near and far sides of the Moon. One of the most likely is that Procellarum was a result of an ancient giant impact on the near side of the Moon. The size of the impact basin has been estimated to be more than 3,000 kilometers, which would make it one of the three largest craters in the Solar System. 

The impact likely happened very early in the Moon&#x27;s history: at the time when magma ocean still existed or just ceased to exist. It deposited 5–30 km of crustal material on the far side forming highlands. If this is the case, all impact related structures such as crater rim, central peak etc. have been obliterated by later impacts and volcanism. One piece of evidence in support of this hypothesis is concentration of incompatible elements (KREEP) and low calcium pyroxene around Oceanus Procellarum.

Procellarum may have also been formed by spatially inhomogeneous heating during the Moon&#x27;s formation. The GRAIL mission, which mapped the gravity gradients of the Moon, found square formations resembling rift valleys surrounding the region beneath the lava plains, suggesting the basin was formed by heating and cooling of the lunar surface by internal processes rather than by an impact, which would have left a round crater.

Other hypotheses include a late accretion of a companion Moon on the far side. The latter postulates that in addition to the present Moon, another smaller (about 1,200 km in diameter) moon was formed from debris of the giant impact. After a few tens of millions of years it collided with the Moon and due to a small collisional velocity simply piled up on one side of the Moon forming what is now known as far side highlands.

==Late lunar volcanism==
Relatively recent (less than 2 bya) volcanic activity had been suspected in the Oceanus Procellarum due to the presence of relatively uneroded features. The 2020 Chang&#x27;e-5 sample return mission provided constraints on the age of Oceanus Procellarum, finding it to be 1963 ± 57 million years old – over a billion years younger than any other previously returned lunar sample. Late lunar volcanic activity was considered surprising as the Moon is much smaller than Earth; interior heat necessary for volcanism should have been lost three billion years ago, so volcanic rocks as late as those found in Oceanus Procellarum must require additional heat sources. 

Previous studies suggested that Oceanus Procellarum should have high concentrations of the heat-producing elements such as potassium, thorium, and uranium, but samples returned showed that the concentration of suspected radioactive elements is much lower than necessary to provide prolonged heating.

==Exploration==
The robotic lunar probes Luna 9, Luna 13, Surveyor 1 and Surveyor 3 landed in Oceanus Procellarum. Luna 9 landed southwest of Galilaei crater in 1966. Luna 13 landed southeast of Seleucus crater, later in 1966. Surveyor 1 landed north of Flamsteed crater (within the larger Flamsteed P) in 1966, and Surveyor 3 landed in 1967. The Chinese probe Chang&#x27;e 5 landed at Statio Tianchuan on Mons Rümker in Oceanus Procellarum in December 2020 and collected of lunar rock samples.During the Apollo program, flight operations planners were concerned about having the optimum lighting conditions at the landing site, hence the alternative target sites moved progressively westward, following the terminator. A delay of two days for weather or equipment reasons would have sent Apollo 11 to Sinus Medii (designated ALS3) instead of ALS2—Mare Tranquillitatis; another two-day delay would have resulted in ALS5, a site in Oceanus Procellarum, being targeted.

During the November 1969 Apollo 12 mission, astronauts (Charles) Pete Conrad and Alan Bean landed the Lunar Module (LM) &quot;Intrepid&quot; nearly 165 meters from Surveyor 3 in Oceanus Procellarum. Their landing site has become known as Statio Cognitum (Latin, &quot;to be known from experience&quot;).

==In popular culture==
*In the 2004 album &quot;Sirens&quot; by Greek metal band Astarte, there is a song named after the lunar mare.

<text>Surveyor 1 was the first lunar soft-lander in the uncrewed Surveyor program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, United States). This lunar soft-lander gathered data about the lunar surface that would be needed for the crewed Apollo Moon landings that began in 1969. The successful soft landing of Surveyor 1 on the &quot;Ocean of Storms&quot; was the first by an American space probe on any extraterrestrial body, occurring on the first attempt and just four months after the first soft Moon landing by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Luna 9 probe.

Surveyor 1 was launched May 30, 1966, from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and it landed on the Moon on June 2, 1966. Surveyor 1 transmitted 11,237 still photos of the lunar surface to the Earth by using a television camera and a sophisticated radio-telemetry system.

The Surveyor program was managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Los Angeles County, California, and the Surveyor space probe was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company in El Segundo, California.

== Mission description ==


The Surveyor series of space probes was designed to carry out the first soft landings on the Moon by any American spacecraft. No instrumentation was carried specifically for scientific experiments by Surveyor 1, but considerable scientific data were collected by its television camera and then returned to Earth via the Deep Space Network from 1966 to 1967. These spacecraft carried two television cameras — one for its approach, which was not used in this case, and one for taking still pictures of the lunar surface. Over 100 engineering sensors were on board each Surveyor. Their television systems transmitted pictures of the spacecraft footpad and surrounding lunar terrain and surface materials. These spacecraft also acquired data on the radar reflectivity of the lunar surface, the load-bearing strength of the lunar surface, and the temperatures for use in the analysis of the lunar surface temperatures. (Later Surveyor space probes, beginning with Surveyor 3, carried scientific instruments to measure the composition and mechanical properties of the lunar &quot;soil&quot;.)

Surveyor 1 was launched May 30, 1966 and sent directly into a trajectory to the Moon without any parking orbit. Its retrorockets were turned off at a height of about 3.4 meters above the lunar surface. Surveyor 1 fell freely to the surface from this height, and it landed on the lunar surface on June 2, 1966, on the &quot;Oceanus Procellarum&quot;. This location was at . This is within the northeast portion of the large crater called Flamsteed P (or the &quot;Flamsteed Ring&quot;). Flamsteed itself lies within Flamsteed P on the south side.

The duration of the spaceflight of Surveyor 1 was about 63 hours, 30 minutes. Surveyor 1&#x27;s lunar launch weight was about , and its landing weight (minus expended maneuvering propellant, its solid-fueled retrorocket (which had been jettisoned), and its radar altimeter system) was about .

Surveyor 1 transmitted video data from the Moon beginning shortly after its landing through July 14, 1966, but with a period of no operations during the two-week long lunar night of June 14, 1966 through July 7, 1966. Because the Moon always presents the same face to Earth, &quot;line-of-sight&quot; radio communications with Surveyor 1 required only changes in ground stations as the Earth rotated. However, since it was solar-powered, Surveyor 1 had no electricity with which to function during the two weeks of the lunar night.

The return of engineering information (temperatures, etc.) from Surveyor 1 continued through January 7, 1967, with several interruptions during the lunar nights.

The landing of Surveyor 1 was carried live on some television networks, and the success of the first Surveyor landing was considered surprising, especially after the failure of a number of the Ranger spacecraft en route to the Moon. Justin Rennilson, formerly of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, stated, &quot;We figured the probability of success at around 10 to 15 percent.&quot; Among hundreds of other challenges, an uninterrupted communication link for navigation and control was critical to success.

== Science instruments ==

=== Television ===

The TV camera consisted of a vidicon tube, a zoom lens operated at either end of its range resulting in 25 millimeter and 100 millimeter focal-lengths, resulting in optical fields of view of 25.3 or 6.43 degrees, a shutter, clear, orange, green and blue optical filters, and iris-system mounted along an axis inclined approximately 16 degrees from the central axis of Surveyor 1. The camera was mounted under a mirror that could be moved in azimuth and elevation. The rotation of the mirror in the azimuth direction, while providing azimuth coverage capability results in an image rotation proportional to the angular azimuth position of the mirror. This is because the image plane and scanning raster of the vidicon are stationary with respect to the mirror azimuth axis. The mirror drive mechanism consisting of stepper motors provided a step size of 2.48° ±0.1° in elevation and 3.0° ±0.1° in azimuth. This calibrated stepping reference allowed the creation of large composite mosaics of the lunar surface and using the data read-back from the iris and focus positioning of the lens permitted some photogrammetric measurements of various lunar features. The TV camera&#x27;s operation was dependent on the receipt of the proper radio commands from the Earth. Frame-by-frame coverage of the lunar surface was obtained over 360 degrees in azimuth and from +40 degrees above the plane normal to the camera&#x27;s axis to -65 degrees below this plane. Both 600-line and 200-line modes of operation were used. The 200-line mode transmitted over an omnidirectional antenna for the first 14 photos and scanned one frame every 61.8 seconds. The remaining transmissions were of 600-line pictures over a directional antenna, and each frame was scanned every 3.6 seconds. Each 200-line picture required 20 seconds for a complete video transmission and it used a radio bandwidth of about 1.2 kilohertz.

Each 600 line picture required about one second to be read from the vidicon tube, and they required a radio bandwidth of about 220 kilohertz. The data transmissions were converted into a standard TV signal for both closed-circuit TV and broadcast TV. The television images were displayed on Earth on a slow-scan monitor coated with a long persistency phosphor. The persistency was selected to optimally match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV frame, and it was displayed in real time at a rate compatible with the incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic tape recorder. Over 10,000 pictures were taken by Surveyor 1&#x27;s TV camera before the lunar sunset of June 14, 1966. Included in these pictures were wide-angle and narrow-angle panoramas, focus ranging surveys, photometric surveys, special area surveys, and celestial photography. Surveyor 1 responded to commands to activate the camera on July 7, and by July 14, 1966, it had returned nearly 1000 more pictures.
=== Strain gauge ===
Strain gauges were mounted on each leg shock absorber to record the peak axial forces at landing impact of the spacecraft. They were designed to accept a force of approximately 800 kgf (7.8 kN).

== Legacy and status ==

On January 6, 1967, Surveyor 1 was reactivated for 12 hours. The spacecraft returned data on the motion of the Moon, which would be used to refine the map of its orbital path around the Earth as well as better determine the distance between the two worlds.

<doc id="98564" wikidata="Q1389012" url="?curid=98564" title="Omar Abdel-Rahman">
<text>Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman (), (ʾUmar ʾAbd ar-Raḥmān; 3 May 1938 – 18 February 2017), commonly known in the United States as &quot;The Blind Sheikh&quot;, was a blind Egyptian Islamist militant who served a life sentence at the Federal Medical Center, Butner near Butner, North Carolina, United States. Formerly a resident of New York City, Abdel-Rahman and nine others were convicted of seditious conspiracy in 1995. His prosecution grew out of investigations of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

Abdel-Rahman was the leader of Al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya (also known as &quot;The Islamic Group&quot;), a militant Islamist movement in Egypt that is considered a terrorist organization by the European Union and the Egyptian government. The group was responsible for many acts of violence, including the November 1997 Luxor massacre, in which 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians were killed. The official 9/11 Commission Report mentions his lectures as an inspiration for the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat. 

==Youth==
Abdel-Rahman was born in the city of al-Gamalia, Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt, on 3 May 1938. He lost his eyesight when he was 10 months old. He studied a Braille version of the Qur&#x27;an as a child, had it memorized by age 11 and was sent to an Islamic boarding school. He developed an interest in the works of Ibn Taymiyah and Sayyid Qutb. He studied at Cairo University&#x27;s School of Theology and later earned a Doctorate in Tafsir (quranic interpretation) from Al-Azhar University in Cairo. His thesis was entitled &quot;Al-Qu&#x27;ran Min Khushumihi Kama Tashawwarahu Surah At-Tawba&quot; (The Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s Attitude toward Its Opponents in the Perspective of Surah At-Tawba), which &quot;received international acclaims with the highest grade.&quot; Part of the 2,000-page dissertation has been published in book form in 2006 in Egypt as &quot;Mawqif al-Qur&#x27;an min khusumih&quot;. Soon after leaving university, Abdel-Rahman began preaching against the secular regime of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Abdel-Rahman became one of the most prominent and outspoken Muslim clerics to denounce Egypt&#x27;s secularism.

==Family==
Omar Abdel-Rahman had two wives, who bore him 10 children: Aisha Hassan Gouda (7 sons), and Aisha Zohdi (3 children). His sons include Ahmed, Mohammed and Asim. Ahmed was killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan in 2011. Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in 2003. He was later extradited to Egypt and was released in 2010. Asim was a close associate of Osama bin Laden following the September 11th attacks.

==Imprisonment in Egypt==
During the 1970s, Abdel-Rahman developed close ties with two of Egypt&#x27;s most militant organizations, Egyptian Islamic Jihad and Al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya (&quot;The Islamic Group&quot;). By the 1980s, he had emerged as the leader of Al-jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, although he was still revered by followers of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which at the time was being led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, later to become the leader of al-Qaeda. Abdel-Rahman spent three years in Egyptian jails while awaiting trial on charges of issuing a fatwa resulting in the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat by Egyptian Islamic Jihad.

==Afghan Mujaheddin==
Although Abdel-Rahman was not convicted of conspiracy in the Sadat assassination, he was expelled from Egypt following his acquittal. He made his way to Afghanistan in the mid-1980s, where he contacted his former professor, Abdullah Azzam, co-founder of Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK) along with Osama bin Laden. Abdel-Rahman built a strong rapport with bin Laden during the Soviet–Afghan War and, following Azzam&#x27;s murder in 1989, he assumed control of the international jihadist arm of MAK/Al Qaeda.

In July 1990, Abdel-Rahman traveled to New York City to gain control of MAK&#x27;s financial and organizational infrastructure in the United States. Abdel-Rahman is said to have established links with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who offered funding and military and logistical support to those fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.

==Activities in the US==
Abdel-Rahman was issued a tourist visa to visit the United States by the consul of the United States Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, despite his name being listed on a U.S. State Department terrorist watch list. Abdel-Rahman entered the United States in July 1990 via Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Sudan. The State Department revoked his tourist visa on 17 November. Despite this, in April 1991, he obtained a green card from the Immigration and Naturalization Service office in Newark, New Jersey. After leaving the U.S. to go on an overseas trip, he tried to re-enter the U.S. in August 1991. At that point, U.S. officials recognized that he was on the lookout list, and began the procedure to revoke his permanent resident status. The U.S. government still allowed him to enter the country, as he had the right to appeal the decision to revoke his residency status. Abdel-Rahman failed to appeal the decision, and on 6 March 1992, the U.S. government revoked his green card. He then requested political asylum. A hearing on that matter was held on 20 January 1993. It was later revealed that Abdel-Rahman was given most of his visa approvals by the CIA. Egyptian officials have testified that the CIA was actively assisting him in entering the US. The CIA also protected Abdel-Rahman after he arrived in the United States.

Abdel-Rahman traveled widely in the United States and Canada. Despite U.S. support for the mujahideen in Afghanistan, Abdel-Rahman spoke out vociferously against the country. He issued a fatwa in the US that declared it lawful to rob banks and kill Jews in the US. His sermons condemned Americans as the &quot;descendants of apes and pigs who have been feeding from the dining tables of the Zionists, Communists, and colonialists&quot;. He called on Muslims to assail the West, &quot;cut the transportation of their countries, tear it apart, destroy their economy, burn their companies, eliminate their interests, sink their ships, shoot down their planes, kill them on the sea, air, or land&quot;.

Preaching at three mosques in the New York City area, Abdel-Rahman was soon surrounded by a core group of devoted followers that included persons who would soon be responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which took place five weeks into the Bill Clinton administration. One of Abdel-Rahman&#x27;s followers, El Sayyid Nosair, was linked to the 1990 Manhattan assassination of Israeli nationalist Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the Jewish Defense League.

Steven Emerson&#x27;s 1994 television documentary &quot;Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America&quot; contains a video of Abdel-Rahman in Detroit, calling for &quot;jihad&quot; against the &quot;infidel&quot;.

In 1993, Egypt suffered a spate of terrorist attacks in which over 1,100 people were either injured or killed. By comparison, the number for the prior year was 322. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, these attacks had &quot;shaken the Egyptian Government&quot;.

Abdel-Rahman was the spiritual leader of Al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, which included the terrorists who were conducting these attacks. At that time, he was recording his sermons in Brooklyn on cassette tapes and sending them to Egypt. These tapes were duplicated and given to tens of thousands of followers in Cairo. In these tapes, Abdel-Rahman called for the murder of infidels, for the ousting of Hosni Mubarak, and for Egypt to become a pure Islamic state.

Mamdouh Beltagui, the head of the state information service in Egypt, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the early 1990s, &quot;Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman uses New York as a base. He raises funds and sends money back to Egypt with couriers. He passes on messages to his followers, giving orders about what they should do next and who they should target. We do not understand why the U.S. authorities have allowed him to enter the country.&quot;

===Arrest, conviction and death===

After the first World Trade Center bombing in February 1993, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began to investigate Abdel-Rahman and his followers more closely. An Egyptian informant wearing a listening device for the FBI managed to record Abdel-Rahman saying he preferred attacks be concentrated on US military targets, but also stating acts of violence against civilian targets were not illicit. The most startling plan, the government charged, was to set off five bombs in 10 minutes, blowing up the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and a federal building housing the FBI. Government prosecutors showed videotapes of the defendants mixing bomb ingredients in a garage before their arrest in 1993. Abdel-Rahman was arrested on 24 June 1993, along with nine of his followers. On 1 October 1995, he was convicted of seditious conspiracy, solicitation to murder Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, conspiracy to murder President Mubarak, solicitation to attack a U.S. military installation, and conspiracy to conduct bombings; in 1996 he was sentenced to life in solitary confinement without parole.

Abdel-Rahman began serving his life sentence at the FMC Rochester in Minnesota. After the September 11 attacks, he was transferred to the FMC Butner in North Carolina. He died there on 18 February 2017 at the age of 78 due to complications from diabetes and coronary artery disease.

It was arranged for the U.S. to transport his body to Egypt for his funeral. His funeral was mentioned in an article in the publication &quot;Al-Masra&quot; by the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

==Efforts for release==
In a speech to supporters in Cairo&#x27;s Tahrir Square on 30 June 2012, Mohamed Morsi briefly mentioned that he would work to free Omar Abdel-Rahman, along with other Egyptians who were arrested during the revolution. A Brotherhood spokesperson later said that the extradition was for humanitarian reasons and that Morsi didn&#x27;t intend to overturn Abdel-Rahman&#x27;s criminal convictions.

During the 2013 In Aménas hostage crisis, a Mauritanian news organization reported that the kidnappers had offered to swap American hostages in Algeria for the release of Abdel-Rahman and Aafia Siddiqui. US State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland stated that the United States would not negotiate with the terrorists.

==Legacy==
Abdel-Rahman&#x27;s imprisonment became a rallying point for Islamic militants around the world, including Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. In 1997, members of his group Al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya conducted two attacks against European visitors to Egypt, including the massacre of 58 Western tourists at Deir el-Bahri in Luxor. In addition to killing women and children, the attackers mutilated a number of bodies and distributed leaflets throughout the scene demanding Abdel-Rahman&#x27;s release.

In 2005, three members of Abdel-Rahman&#x27;s legal team, lawyer Lynne Stewart, translator Mohamed Yousry and postal clerk Ahmed Abdel Sattar, were convicted of facilitating communication between Abdel-Rahman and members of the US designated-terrorist organization Al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya in Egypt. They received long federal prison sentences, based on their violated obligation to keep Abdel-Rahman incommunicado while providing him legal counsel.

Qasim al Raymi, leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, eulogized Abdul Rahman on 6 March. His eulogy was critical of the US.

<doc id="98568" wikidata="Q181952" url="?curid=98568" title="Pope John XIII">
<text>Pope John XIII (; died 6 September 972) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 1 October 965 to his death. His pontificate was caught up in the continuing conflict between the Holy Roman emperor, Otto I, and the Roman nobility. After long and arduous negotiations, he succeeded in arranging a Byzantine marriage for Otto II, in an effort to legitimize the Ottonian claim to imperial dignity. He also established church hierarchy in Poland and Bohemia.

==Family and early career==
Born in Rome, John was the son of another John, who was a bishop. It has been conjectured that his father was the Roman noble John Crescentius, a member of the Crescentii family who had married into the family of Count Theophylact I of Tusculum. If so, his father had previously been a duke, and possibly even appointed consul, prior to his ordination as bishop. Consequently, John was probably the brother of Crescentius the Elder (the &quot;patricius romanorum&quot;), as well as Stephania, lady of Palestrina (who married Count Benedict, rector of the Sabina) and Marozia, who married Count Gregory I of Tusculum.

Brought up at the Lateran palace, he was a member of the &quot;schola cantorum&quot;, and his career during that time saw him pass through a number of positions, including that of &quot;Ostiarius&quot;, Reader, Exorcist and Acolyte before reaching the ranks of Subdeacon and then Deacon. After leaving the schola, he took an active part in papal administration, serving in the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs under popes John XII and Leo VIII. He also served as Librarian of the Holy Apostolic See in 961. At some point he was appointed as the bishop of Narni, as which he participated in the Synod of Rome (963) which deposed Pope John XII, as well as the Synod of Rome (964) which saw his restoration.

==Accession and rebellion==
After the death of Leo VIII, the Roman nobility asked the Holy Roman emperor, Otto I, for the reinstatement of Pope Benedict V. When this was not possible, Bishop John Crescentius was suggested as a compromise candidate by Otto&#x27;s envoys, the bishops Otger of Spiers and Liutprand of Cremona. Elected unanimously, John was consecrated on Sunday, 1 October 965, five months after the death of Leo VIII.

John immediately took on the task of curbing the power of the Roman nobility. He gave members of the Crescentii family important positions to shore up his support, while he also sought closer ties with the emperor. However, with the emperor back in Germany, various local powers decided to take advantage of his absence to intrigue against John XIII. The former king Adalbert of Italy had appeared in front of an army in Lombardy, whilst the Roman nobility, disliking John&#x27;s behaviour, and resenting his imposition by a foreign power, staged a revolt. Under the leadership of Peter, the Prefect of the city, together with Rofred, the Count of Roman Campagna and the &quot;Vestararius&quot; Stephen, they roused the Roman nobility by declaring that 
The leaders of the Roman militia captured the pope on December 16, 965, and imprisoned him in Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. However, fearing John&#x27;s presence there would inspire resistance from his followers, the pope was moved to one of Rofred&#x27;s castles in the Campagna. Word eventually reached Otto of all these disturbances, and he entered Italy in late summer of 966 at the head of an enormous army. In the meantime, John had managed to escape from Campagna, and made his way to Capua, placing himself under the protection of Pandulf Ironhead. In thanks for Pandulf&#x27;s aid, John converted Capua into a Metropolitan see, and consecrated as its first archbishop Pandulf&#x27;s brother John, on August 14, 966. In Rome, the pope&#x27;s supporters rose up, and Rofred and Stephen were killed by John Crescentius, the pope&#x27;s nephew. Pope John left Capua, and crossed into Sabina, where he was met by his brother-in-law, Benedict, who also offered John his support. With Rome effectively back in his hands, John returned and was welcomed back into the city on November 14, 966. Although he was initially lenient towards the rebels, the arrival of Otto saw a change in approach. The emperor banished to Germany the two men appointed consul; the twelve principal militia leaders (the &quot;Decarcones&quot;, one appointed to each of the city&#x27;s twelve regions) were hanged. Other plotters were either executed or blinded. The Prefect of the city, Peter, was handed over to John, who ordered him to be hung by his hair from the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius, after which he was taken down, placed naked and backwards on an ass. A bag of feathers was placed upon his head and two more at his thighs. With a bell fastened round its neck, Peter was driven through the city, and after being thus exposed to the ridicule of the people, Peter was cast into a dungeon before finally being sent by the emperor into Germany. In gratitude for the emperor&#x27;s intervention, John lauded him by declaring him to be the liberator and restorer of the Church, the illustrious guest, and three times blessed emperor.

In 969, he met Gerbert d&#x27;Aurillac, the future Pope Sylvester II, and was so impressed by his scholarly brilliance that he kept him on in Rome in order to learn from him.

==Troubles with the Byzantine Empire==

After John XIII&#x27;s restoration, he worked with the Emperor on ecclesiastical improvements. It was decided in a council held at Rome in the beginning of 967 in the emperor&#x27;s presence that Grado was to be the patriarchal and metropolitan church of the whole of the Veneto. At another council at Ravenna in April 967, Otto again &quot;restored to the apostolic Pope John the city and territory of Ravenna and many other possessions which had for some time been lost to the Popes.&quot; At around this time he also created, at Otto&#x27;s request, the Archbishopric of Magdeburg.

Then, on Christmas Day in 967, John XIII crowned Otto I&#x27;s son Otto II as co-emperor. Various synods were held before the emperors left Rome for the south of Italy, in which, sometimes at their request, John XIII took several German monasteries under his special protection, or decided that in some cases they were to remain forever &quot;under the patronage (&quot;mundiburdium&quot;) of the kings or emperors.&quot; With Otto I seeking a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire through his son and a Byzantine princess, John XIII lent his support to Otto&#x27;s cause. He wrote a letter to the Eastern emperor, Nikephoros II Phokas, but ended up insulting him by referring to him, not as &quot;emperor of the Romans&quot;, but as &quot;emperor of the Greeks&quot;. As his price for the marriage, Otto demanded a dowry from the Eastern Empire, that of the themes of Longobardia and Calabria. Nikephoros retorted by instead demanding the restitution of the Exarchate of Ravenna, which included Rome and the Papal States, as the price for the imperial marriage. When negotiations broke down, Nikephoros refused to write to John XIII in his own hand, instead sending him a threatening letter written by his brother, Leo Phokas the Younger.

After the failure of negotiations, Nikephoros attempted to extend the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the patriarch of Constantinople into the pope&#x27;s jurisdiction in southern Italy. The eastern emperor ordered the patriarch to transform the bishopric of Otranto into a metropolitan see, and to ensure that services were no longer said in Latin, but in Greek only. Patriarch Polyeuctus of Constantinople quickly addressed an order to the head of the Church of Otranto giving him authority to consecrate bishops in the churches of Acerenza, Tursi, Gravina, Matera, and Tricarico, all previously dependent on the Church of Rome. In response, and at the request of the Western emperor, John convened a synod in 969, which elevated the bishopric of Benevento into a metropolitan see, thus reducing the influence of the Byzantine Empire and Eastern Orthodox Church there.

The death of Nikephoros Phokas in 969 saw the elevation of John I Tzimiskes. He entered into negotiations with Otto I, and soon Otto II was betrothed to Theophanu, the niece of Tzimiskes. The marriage was performed by John XIII at Rome on 14 April 972.

==Relations with other states==
John was also involved in the development of ecclesiastical structures across Europe. In 968, John appointed the first bishop in Poland, Jordan. In 973, John appointed Mlada, a sister of Duke Boleslaus II of Bohemia, as an abbess of the Benedictine Order. He gave her a papal bull which authorised the foundation of the Bishopric of Prague in accordance with the wishes of Boleslaus, which had been made through Mlada. John decreed that the church of Saints Vitus and Wenceslaus should be the new cathedral church. At the church of St. George, a convent of nuns was to be established, over which Mlada was to preside. Finally, the Latin rite and not the Byzantine rite was to be followed, and someone who was well instructed in Latin literature had to be chosen as the first bishop.

In 971, John XIII published a bull supporting the action of the English king Edgar the Peaceful and Archbishop Dunstan against the canons of Winchester Cathedral, who refused to give up their wives and concubines. In that same year, John confirmed the privileges which King Edgar had granted the monks of Glastonbury Abbey, and declared that it was under papal protection. Further, John sent a letter to an ealdorman named Aelfric, commanding him to cease taking money from Glastonbury.

In Trier, John appointed the archbishop of Trier as the papal vicar, responsible for promoting the decrees of any synods held in Germany or West Francia. He also granted numerous privileges across Europe. In one case, dated September 29, 970, for the monastery of St. Vincent of Metz, we find the first recorded grant of the Pontificals. Its abbot was granted the use, under certain conditions, of the Dalmatic and Episcopal sandals. John was also the recipient of many requests for help. In one case, the monks of the monastery of St. Peter at Novalisa, asked for the pope to intervene to help protect them against a local count named Ardoin. In another case, in November 971, Archbishop Adalberon of Reims went to Rome to ask the pope to confirm the archbishop&#x27;s decision to leave some property to the monks of Mouzon Abbey, thereby protecting his donation from King Louis IV of France.

In 970, John bestowed the town of Praeneste as a hereditary lease to Senatrix Stephania, who was probably his sister. Praeneste was to belong to her, her children, and her grandchildren, for a yearly rent of ten gold solidi, but it was afterwards to return to the Church. It is one of the first examples of the introduction of the system of feudalism into Roman territory.

== Death and lore ==
John XIII died on 6 September 972, and was buried in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. He was succeeded by Benedict VI. The earliest surviving written mention of the ancient practice of the blessing of church bells comes from his reign.

Referred to by one chronicler after his death as &quot;The Good&quot;, John was noted for his reverence and piety, as well as being highly learned in both scripture and canon law. From childhood he carried the nickname of &quot;the White Hen&quot;, due to his light colored hair. His epitaph used to be in the basilica where he was buried, between the front door and the first column, and it read:
There is a legend which attached itself to the reign of John XIII. According to Dietrich I of Metz, one of the nobles attached to the court of the emperor Otto I was possessed by an evil spirit, resulting in his tearing at his own face, and biting his hands and arms. The emperor ordered that the nobleman be taken to Pope John XIII, with instructions that the Chains of Saint Peter be placed upon him, and so cure him. According to the legend, John placed several chains on the afflicted man, each of which were copies, but to no effect. However, when John placed the true chain of Saint Peter on him, a thick smoke issued from the nobleman&#x27;s body, cries were heard in the air, and the evil spirit left the nobleman.

<doc id="98569" wikidata="Q6699750" url="?curid=98569" title="Lugbara mythology">
<text>The Lugbara live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and South Sudan. Their number totaled approximately 240,000, with around 180,000 residing in north-western Uganda, with the remaining population spread across bordering areas of the modern-day Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. The Lugbara people speak in a Sudanese language. The basic social and economic unit found in Lugbara culture is a lineage group under the authority of a male genealogical elder called ba wara, meaning &quot;big man&quot;. These lineage groups, often referred to as sub-tribes, typically lived in a village built atop a hillside or ridge. In addition to the male elder, other religious leaders include diviners, oracles, and rain men.

== Creation Myth ==
Lugbara believe that they are all of one blood, &quot;ari alo&quot;, and that blood was created by God, &quot;Adronga &#x27;ba o&#x27;bapiri&quot;. Whilst there are many different versions of the Lugbara creation myth, most agree that God created the first beings Gborgboro and Meme at Loloi to the North in South Sudan. Gborgboro and Meme had two children together, Arube and O&#x27;du. The siblings and subsequent siblings had children together for several generations. The last pair of siblings were the parents of the hero-ancestor Jaki.

Other versions of the creation myth explain the separation of God and mankind in the sky, the separation of black and white people, the building of a tower of Babel. Furthermore, they explain the appearance of the Lugbara and Kakwa peoples as well as the various tribes and languages of the world. Some versions also explain the creation of the world as it is today.

==Hero-ancestors==
Lugbara mythology has two hero ancestors, Jaki and Dribidu. Whilst both of their stories share similarities, they are not related to one another and entered the Lugbara Highlands independently of one another. Both shared superhuman and magical abilities and were the first rain makers. In addition, they shared their knowledge of magical medicines with their descendents. Furthermore, their many sons became the founders of the original Lugbara clans.

Jaki entered the Lugbara highlands from the north and north-west, where the Kakwa people reside today.  

Dribidu, &#x27;the hairy one&#x27;, had long hair covering most of his body. He is also referred to as Banyale, &#x27;eater of men&#x27;, because he ate his children until he was discovered and forced to leave his home on the east bank of the Nile. He traveled through the Nile valley at East Madi in eastern Uganda, and crossed the river at Gimara, entering the Lugbara Highlands.

Both hero-ancestors died on mountains overlooking the Lugbara plains. Jaki on Mount Liru, and Dribidu on Mount Eti.

Both Jaki and Dribidu have myths about how they both found a leper woman who provided him with fire to cook. In both myths, they cure the woman using a medicine that has since been forgotten and in the end, they marry her.

== God in Lugbara Mythology ==
There are many different names for God in Lugbara mythology. John Middleton (1955) wrote that the Lugbara believe that God has two aspects, one transcendent and the other immanent. The transcendent aspect is often referred to as &quot;Adroa or Adronga&quot; whilst the immanent aspect is referred to as &quot;Adro&quot;.

Adroa appeared in both good and evil aspects; he was the creator god and appeared on Earth as a man who was near death. He was depicted as a very tall white man with only one half of a body, missing one eye, one leg, etc. His children were called the Adroanzi.

The Adroanzi were nature gods of specific rivers, trees and other sacred wild areas. At night, they followed people and protected them from animals and bandits as long as they did not look over their shoulder to ensure that an Adroanzi was following; if the person did so, the Adroanzi killed them. They ate the people they killed. They were also sometimes known as water snakes. Some Lugbara consider them gardeners.

== Key figures in Lugbara Mythology ==
Adronga &#x27;ba o&#x27;bapiri, or God creator of men, created the first beings on Earth, Gborgboro and Meme, as well as creating domestic livestock. God is also referred to as &quot;Adro&quot; or &quot;Adroa&quot;.

Gborgboro, means &#x27;the person coming from the sky&#x27;. He was created by Adronga &#x27;ba o&#x27;bapiri, along with Meme. Father of O&#x27;du and Arube.

Meme, means the person with a big body. In some versions of the Lugbara creation myth, Meme is a man but in most she is a woman. She was created by Adronga &#x27;ba o&#x27;bapiri, along with Gborgboro. Wild animals came from her womb, the gazelle broke out first and the other animals followed. After the animals had left her womb, she bore two children, O&#x27;du and Arube, a girl and a boy.

O&#x27;du, means miraculous omen. She was one of the first set of siblings and was born with teeth. Some versions of the myth say she and Arube are the same person.

Arube, means maker of miracles. He was one of the first set of siblings and was born with teeth. Some myths say he is the same person as O&#x27;du.

Yeke, means owner of the land. He was the first man to settle and farm land and was the father of Jaki, one of the hero-ancestors.

== Rites of Sacrifice Among the Lugbara ==
Due to extreme variations in culture in different Lugbara groups, there is not one clearly defined rite of sacrifice, nor consistently shared ritual behaviours. Offerings and sacrifices are typically made at a selection of shrines located both near and inside the home, designed to honour the dead and other spirits. Sacrificial rites are an activity that is distanced from regular religious behaviour associated with the Lugbara. There are four rites of sacrifice that occur most commonly across Lugbara:

The first is rua edezu, or cleansing the body. There are several scenarios in which the &quot;rua edezu&quot; rite may be enacted. A common case is to cleanse sickness from the body of a man who has had a disagreement with a member of his family who has died before the disagreement could be resolved. It is believed that sickness is likely to strike the child of the sick man if he is to take the widow of the dead man. It can be determined that the sickness was sent by Divine Spirit after consultations with oracles and then diviners. The ritual is performed by the patrilineal elder, in which a sheep is assigned to the sick man. The sheep is then walked the perimeter of the sick man&#x27;s home, given a &quot;ritual address&quot;, then killed and eaten by members of the lineage group. A similar rite called angu edezu, meaning cleansing the territory, may be performed in the occurrence of a pregnancy outside of marriage or persistent disagreements.

The second rite is ori owizu, a sacrifice to patrilineal ghosts. This sacrifice is also made as a result of sickness. An animal, such as a goat, ox, bird or most commonly, a sheep, is assigned to the sick person and blessed by an elder. After the sick person has recovered, the animal is killed in their home and divided into three portions; the first portion is given to the dead by placing the meat at their shrines; the second is eaten by the lineage group; the third is taken home to be given to more distant lineage members. The recovered person is then blessed with breath and spit through the use of leaves, then the meat is eaten.  

The third rite is an offering given to Divine Spirit. This act is called a&#x27;izu, meaning to pray or to beseech. This is an offering given in order to receive rain or to remove an epidemic. In this ritual, a rainmaker adorns a white ram with beads that were once owned by a man who has since died of a disease such as meningitis. The ram is first led in a circle around the entire territory of the lineage group and then chased over a river into mountains by the rainmaker. It is believed that the ram transforms into a leopard and then into rain. Contrary to other rituals, the dead are not involved and there is no direct killing of the animal. A human who had been disembowelled atop a hill was the original offering in this sacrifice and the sheep is the modern replacement.

The fourth rite is an offering to the spirits. This category of Lugbara rite is the most varied across the Lugbara people. In Lugbara religion, spirits are believed to be &quot;in the air&quot;, and thus there is no set place where these offerings must occur. It is believed that only diviners are capable of communicating with spirits and offerings are performed by them by entering a trance in a dark hut far from the village. The offering is typically performed near a river, as they are places of great spiritual power. The diviner will offer food and drink to the spirits, such as milk and grains. These offerings take place after a spirit is thought to have communicated with the living either by sending illness or through possession of a person&#x27;s body.

<text>Monterey Bay is a bay of the Pacific Ocean located on the coast of the U.S. state of California, south of the San Francisco Bay Area. San Francisco itself is further north along the coast, by about 75 miles (120 km), accessible via CA 1 and US 101.

Santa Cruz is located at the north end of the bay, and Monterey is on the Monterey Peninsula at the south end. The &quot;Monterey Bay Area&quot; is a regional term used to describe the Monterey Bay-adjacent Central Coast communities of Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito counties. The three counties, along with Monterey Bay-adjacent cities, collaborate in the Association of Monterey Bay Governments (AMBAG) on regional issues and come together for events like the State of the Region hosted by the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership.

==Toponymy==
The first European to enter Monterey Bay was Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo on November 16, 1542, while sailing northward along the coast on an imperial Spanish naval expedition. He named the bay &quot;Bahía de los Pinos&quot;, probably because of the forest of pine trees first encountered while rounding the peninsula at the southern end of the bay. Cabrillo&#x27;s name for the bay was lost, but the westernmost point of the peninsula is still known as Point Pinos.

On December 10, 1595, Sebastián Rodríguez Cermeño crossed the bay and bestowed the name &quot;Bahía de San Pedro&quot; in honor of Saint Peter Martyr.

The present name for the bay was given in 1602 by Sebastián Vizcaíno, who had been tasked by the Spanish government to complete a detailed chart of the coast. On December 16, 1602 he rounded a large peninsula and entered a bay that he named &quot;Puerto de Monterrey&quot; in honor of Don Gaspár de Zúñiga y Acevedo, 5th Count of Monterrey, who was the governor of New Spain and had dispatched the expedition. Monterrey is the Castilian spelling of Monterrei, a municipality in the Galicia region of Spain from which the viceroy and his father (the Fourth Count of Monterrei) originated.
All other place names in the vicinity containing &quot;Monterey&quot; were so named because of their proximity to the bay. This includes the Presidio of Monterey, City of Monterey, County of Monterey and Monterey Canyon.

==Geology==
The Monterey Canyon, one of the largest underwater canyons in the world, begins off the coast of Moss Landing, in the center of Monterey Bay. It is long, although its shape changes regularly because of currents and sediment being left in the area. The canyon is much like that of a continental slope; the biology of the canyon changes significantly in different parts of the canyon.

==Flora and fauna==
Monterey Bay is home to many species of marine mammals, including sea otters, harbor seals, and bottlenose dolphins; as well as being on the migratory path of gray and humpback whales and a breeding site for elephant seals. Killer whales are atypically found along the coast, especially when gray whales migrate, as they hunt the whales during their migration north. Many species of fish, sharks, mollusks such as abalone and squid, birds, and sea turtles also live in the bay. Several varieties of kelp grow in the bay, some becoming as tall as trees, forming what is known as a kelp forest.

==Marine protected areas==
Soquel Canyon State Marine Conservation Area, Portuguese Ledge State Marine Conservation Area, Pacific Grove Marine Gardens State Marine Conservation Area, Lovers Point State Marine Reserve, Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area and Asilomar State Marine Reserve are marine protected areas in Monterey Bay. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.
