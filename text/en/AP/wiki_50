<text>Prajapati (, ) is a Vedic deity of Hinduism and he is a form of Brahma, the creator god.

Prajapati is a form of the creator-god Brahma, but the name is also the name of many different gods, in many Hindu scriptures, ranging from the creator god Brahma to being the same as one of the following deities: Vishvakarma, Agni, Indra, Daksha, and many others, because of the diverse Hindu cosmology. In classical and medieval era literature, Prajapati is the metaphysical concept called Brahman as Prajapati-Brahman, and Brahman is the primordial matter that made Prajapati.

==Etymology==
Prajapati (Sanskrit: ) is a compound of &quot;praja&quot; (creation, procreative powers) and &quot;pati&quot; (lord, master). The term means &quot;lord of creatures&quot;, or &quot;lord of all born beings&quot;. In the later Vedic texts, Prajapati is a distinct Vedic deity, but whose significance diminishes. Later, the term is synonymous with other gods, particularly Brahma. Still later, the term evolves to mean any divine, semi-divine or human sages who create something new.

==Origins==

The origins of Prajapati are unclear. He appears late in the Vedic layer of texts, and the hymns that mention him provide different cosmological theories in different chapters. He is missing from the Samhita layer of Vedic literature, conceived in the Brahmana layer, states Jan Gonda. Prajapati is younger than Savitr, and the word was originally an epithet for the sun. His profile gradually rises in the Vedas, peaking within the Brahmanas. Scholars such as Renou, Keith and Bhattacharji posit Prajapati originated as an abstract or semi-abstract deity in the later Vedic milieu as speculations evolved from the archaic to more learned speculations.

===Similar Deities ===
A similarity between Prajapati (and related figures in Hindu mythology) and Phanes, also named as Protogonus (, literally &quot;first-born&quot;) of the Greco-Roman mythology has been proposed:

According to Robert Graves, the name of /PRA-JĀ[N]-pati/ (&#x27;progeny-potentate&#x27;) is etymologically equivalent to that of the oracular god Phanes at Colophon (according to Macrobius), namely /prōtogonos/. The cosmic egg concept linked to Prajapati and Phanes is common in many parts of the world, states David Leeming, which appears in later Greco-Roman worship in Greece and Rome.

==Texts==
Prajapati is described in many ways in Hindu texts, both in the Vedas and in the post-Vedic texts. These range from Brahma to being same as one of the following: Agni, Indra, Vishvakarma, Daksha and many others.

===Vedas===
His role varies within the Vedic texts such as being one who created heaven and earth, all of waters and beings, the creator of the universe, the creator of gods and goddesses, the creator of devas and devis and &quot;asuras and asuris and&quot; the cosmic egg and the Purusha. His role peaked in the Brahmanas layer of Vedic texts, then declined to name a group of creators in the creation process. In some Brahmana texts, his role is paired since he co-creates with the powers of the creator goddess Vac.

In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Prajapati appears as a name for Savitr, Chandra, Agni and Indra, who are all praised as equal, same and gods of creatures. Elsewhere, in hymn 10.121 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, is described &quot;Hiranyagarbha&quot; (golden embryo) that was born from the waters containing everything, which produced Prajapati. It then created &quot;manas&quot; (mind), &quot;kama&quot; (desire), &quot;tapas&quot; (heat) and Prajapati created the universe. And this Prajapati is a creator god who created the universe, one of many Hindu cosmology theories, and there is no supreme god or supreme goddess in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. One of the striking features about the Hindu Prajapati myths, states Jan Gonda, is the idea that the work of creation is a gradual process, completed in stages of trial and improvement.

In the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;, embedded inside the &quot;Yajurveda&quot;, Prajapati was self-created from Brahman (Ultimate Reality) and Prajapati co-creates the world with Vac. It also includes the &quot;golden cosmic egg&quot; mythology, wherein Prajapati is stated to be born from a golden egg in primeval sea after the egg was incubated for a year. His sounds became the sky, the earth and the seasons. When he inhaled, he created the devas and devis, and light. When he exhaled, he created the asuras and asuris, and darkness. Then, together with the Vac, he and she created all beings and universe. In Chapter 10 of the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;, as well as chapter 13 of &quot;Pancavimsa Brahmana&quot;, is presented another myth where in Prajapati is a creator god, becomes creating with Vac, the creator goddess, all living creatures generated, then &quot;Mrtyu&quot; seizes these beings within his and her womb, but because these beings are created by Prajapati and Vac, they desire to live like him and her and Prajapati and Vac kill Mrtyu and creates the universe with releasing all living creatures in his and her womb.

The &quot;Aitareya Brahmana&quot; tells a different myth, wherein Prajapati, having created the gods and goddesses, turns into a stag and approaches his daughter with Vac, Ushas who was in the form of a doe, to produce other animals. The gods and goddesses are horrified by this incest, and joined forces and created the angry destructive Rudra to kill Prajapati for doing incest with Ushas and before Prajapati mates with Ushas, Rudra drives Prajapati away. Then Rudra kills Prajapati and Ushas runs away and Prajapati is resurrected. The &quot;Sankhyayana Brahmana&quot; tells another myth, wherein Prajapati created Agni, Surya, Chandra, Vayu, Ushas and all deities. Agni, Surya, Chandra, Vayu, Ushas and all deities released their energies and created the universe.

In section 2.266 of Jaiminiya Brahmana, Prajapati is presented as a spiritual teacher. His student Varuna lives with him for 100 years, studying the art and duties of being the &quot;father-like king of gods and goddesses&quot; and is a king of the gods and goddesses.

===Upanishads===
Prajapati appears in early Upanishads, among the most influential texts in Hinduism. He is described in the Upanishads in diverse ways. For example, in different Upanishads, he is presented as the personification of creative power after Brahman, the same as the wandering eternal soul, as symbolism for unmanifest obscure first born, as manifest procreative sexual powers, the knower particularly of Atman (soul, self), and a spiritual teacher that is within each person. The &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot;, as an illustration, presents him as follows:

In Chandogya Upanishad 1.2.1, Prajapati appears as the creator of all devas and devis and asuras and asuris: &quot;The gods and goddesses and the demons and demonesses are both children of Prajapati, yet they fought among themselves.&quot; ().

===Post-Vedic texts===
In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Brahma is declared to be a Prajapati who creates many males and females, and imbues them with desire and anger, the former to drive them into reproducing themselves and the latter to be being like gods and goddesses. Other chapters of the epics and Puranas declare Vishnu and Shiva to be Prajapatis.

The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; uses the epithet Prajapati to describe Krishna, the eight incarnation of Vishnu in the Dashavatara of Vishnu along with many other epithets.

The Grhyasutras include Prajapati as among the deities invoked during wedding ceremonies and prayed to for blessings of prosperous progeny, and harmony between husband and wife.

Prajapati is the God of Universe, Fire, Sun, Creation, etc. He is also identified with various mythical progenitors, especially (Manusmriti 1.34) the ten gods of created beings which are first created by Brahma: Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishtha, Daksha, Bhrigu, Narada.

In the Puranas, there are groups of Prajapatis called &quot;Prajapatayah&quot; who were rishis (sages) from whom all of the world is created, followed by a Prajapatis list that widely varies in number and name between different texts. According to George Williams, the inconsistent, varying and evolving Prajapati concept in Hindu mythology reflects the diverse Hindu cosmology.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the genre of Puranas call various gods and sages as Prajapati. Some illustrations, states Roshen Dalal, include Agni, Bharata, Shashabindu, Shukra, Havirdhaman, Indra, Kapila, Kshupa, Prithu, Chandra, Svishtakrita, Tvashtra, Vishvakarma, Virana.

In the medieval era texts of Hinduism, Prajapatis refers to legendary agents of creation, gods and sages who are working in creation, who appear in every cycle of creation-maintenance-destruction. Their numbers vary between seven, ten, sixteen or twenty-one at times.

==&quot;Prajapati&quot; as a title==

Prajapati is also a title in Hindu cosmology. According to the Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata, Brahma initially created twenty-one Prajapatis to facilitate the process of creation.

Hindu temples in Bali, Indonesia that are dedicated to Brahma as Prajapati are called as &quot;Pura Prajapati&quot;, also called as &quot;Pura Mrajapati&quot;, are common. They are mostly associated with funeral rituals and the Ngaben (cremation) ceremony for the dead where Brahma as Prajapati is invoked to preside over the funeral ceremonies happening there.

<text>In Indian religions, a rishi ( ) is an accomplished and enlightened person. They find mention in various Vedic texts. Rishis are believed to have composed hymns of the Vedas. The Post-Vedic tradition of Hinduism regards the rishis as &quot;great yogis&quot; or &quot;sages&quot; who after intense meditation (tapas) realized the supreme truth and eternal knowledge, which they composed into hymns. The term appears in Pali literature as Ishi; in Buddhism they can be either Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, Arahats or a monk of high rank.

==Etymology==

According to Indian tradition, the word may be derived from two different meanings of the root &#x27;rsh&#x27; (). Sanskrit grammarians derive this word from the second meaning: &quot;to go, to move&quot;. V. S. Apte gives this particular meaning and derivation, and Monier-Williams also gives the same, with some qualification.

Another form of this root means &quot;to flow, to move near by flowing&quot;. (All the meanings and derivations cited above are based upon &quot;Sanskrit English Dictionary&quot; of Monier-Williams). Monier-Williams also quotes Tārānātha who compiled the great (Sanskrit-to-Sanskrit) dictionary named &quot;ṛṣati jñānena saṃsāra-pāram&quot; (i.e., &quot;one who reaches beyond this mundane world by means of spiritual knowledge&quot;).

Before Monier-Williams&#x27; work was published, Yāska suggested it came from &quot;drish&quot; and quotes Aupamanyava to support his opinion.

However, the root has a close Avestan cognate &quot;ərəšiš&quot; &quot;an ecstatic&quot; (see also Yurodivy, Vates). Yet the Indo-European dictionary of Julius Pokorny connects the word to a PIE root &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;rise, protrude&quot;, in the sense of &quot;excellent&quot; and thus cognate with Ṛta and and Asha. In Sanskrit, forms of the root &quot;rish&quot; become &quot;arsh-&quot; in many words, (e.g., &quot;arsh&quot;)

Modern etymological explanations such as by Manfred Mayrhofer in his &quot;Etymological Dictionary&quot; leave the case open, and do not prefer a connection to &#x27; &quot;pour, flow&quot; (PIE &#x27;), rather one with German &quot;rasen&quot; &quot;to be ecstatic, be in a different state of mind&quot; (and perhaps Lithuanian &quot;aršus&quot;).

==In Hindu texts==

In the Vedas, the word denotes an inspired poet of Vedic hymns. In particular, Ṛṣi refers to the authors of the hymns of the Rigveda. Some of the earliest lists of &quot;Rishi&quot; are found in Jaiminiya Brahmana verse 2.218 and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad verse 2.2.4.

Post-Vedic tradition regards the Rishis as &quot;sages&quot; or saints, constituting a peculiar class of divine human beings in the early mythical system, as distinct from Asuras, Devas and mortal men. Swami Vivekananda described &quot;Rishi&quot;s as &quot;Mantra-drashtas&quot; or &quot;the seers of thought&quot;. He told— &quot;The truth came to the Rishis of India — the Mantra-drashtâs, the seers of thought — and will come to all Rishis in the future, not to talkers, not to book-swallowers, not to scholars, not to philologists, but to seers of thought.&quot;

The Rig Veda mentions female rishikas such as Romasha, Lopamudra, Apala, Kadru, Visvavara, Ghosha, Juhu, Vagambhrini, Paulomi, Yami, Indrani, Savitri and Devayani. The Sama Veda adds Nodha, Akrishtabhasha, Sikatanivavari and Gaupayana.

In Mahabharata 12, on the other hand, there is the post-Vedic list of Marīci, Atri, Angiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya and Vashista. The Mahābhārata list explicitly refers to the saptarshis of the first manvantara and not to those of the present manvantara. Each manvantara had a unique set of saptarshi. In Harivamsha 417ff, the names of the Rishis of each manvantara are enumerated.

In addition to the Sapta, there are other classifications of sages. In descending order of precedence, they are Brahmarshi, Maharshi, Rajarshi. Deva, Param, Shruta and Kānda are added in Manusmriti iv-94 and xi-236 and in two dramas of Kālidasa.

The Chaturvarga-Chintāmani of Hemādri puts &quot; at the seventh place in the eightfold division of Brāhmanas. Amarakosha (the famous Sanskrit synonym lexicon compiled by Amarasimha) mentions seven types of s : Shrutarshi, Kāndarshi, Paramarshi, Maharshi, Rājarshi, Brahmarshi and Devarshi. Amarakosha strictly distinguishes Rishi from other types of sages, such as sanyāsi, , parivrājaka, tapasvi, muni, brahmachāri, yati, etc.

== In Buddhist texts ==
The term Rishi found mentions throughout the Buddhist texts. In Pali, they are known as &quot;Isi&quot;s. A Rishi can also be called a Buddha, Paccekabuddha, Arhat or monk of high rank. In Buddhist Pali literature, Buddha is called many times as &quot;Mahesi&quot;(Pali; Sanskrit: Maharṣi; meaning the greatest sage). The Isigili Sutta in Pali Canon, mentions the name of Five hundred Rishis (Paccekabuddhas). The Buddhist text, Mahamayuri Tantra, written during 1–3rd centuries CE, mentions Rishis throughout Jambudvipa (modern day India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal) and invokes them for the protection of the Buddhadharma.

Many Jatakas also mentions various Rishis. The Naḷinikā Jātaka (Jā 526) introduces a past life of the Buddha, a Rishi(Isi), living alone in the Himālayas. His son, who was also a Rishi, was named Isisiṅga (Pali; Sanskrit:&quot;Ṛṣyaśṛṅga&quot;). The Agastya Jataka (Sanskrit; Pali: Akitta Jataka) story, mentions Bodhisattva, named Agastya(Sanskrit; Pali: Akkhata) as Rishi.

==Rishi in Indonesia==
Most medieval era Hindu temples of Java, Indonesia show Rishi Agastya statues or reliefs, usually guarding the southern side of Shaivite temples. Some examples include Candi Sambisari and the Prambanan temple near Yogyakarta.

==Ruesi in Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos==

Ruesi (Sanskrit: &quot;ṛṣi&quot;, , , ) is a hermit sage, the equivalent of Rishi in India. In Myanmar, there are some known as ရေသ့ &quot;Rase&quot;. Rishi Akkhata(Pali; Sanskrit: Agastya), known as Phra Reusi Akkhot in Thailand, is an important Ruesi in Southeast Asia, as in the Buddhist Jataka scriptures, this Ruesi is mentioned as the bodhisatta and practiced his ascetism in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Veneration of Ruesis is a notable practice in Southeast Asian Buddhism. The name &quot;Rishi&quot; (pronounced &quot;ruesi&quot;) is also the basis of one of the letters of the Thai alphabet, &quot;so reu-si&quot; ().

==Other uses==
Rishi is also a male given name, and less commonly a Brahmin last name.

In Carnatic music, &quot;Rishi&quot; is the seventh &quot;chakra&quot; (group) of Melakarta ragas. The names of &quot;chakras&quot; are based on the numbers associated with each name. In this case, there are seven rishis and hence the 7th &quot;chakra&quot; is &quot;Rishi&quot;.

The descendant families of these Rishis, refer to their ancestral lineage through their family &quot;gotra&quot;. This is a common practice among the Brahmin sects of the current Hindu society.

<text>Vritra (, , ) is a danava in Hinduism. He serves as the personification of drought, and is an adversary of the king of the devas, Indra. As a danava, he belongs to the race of the asuras. Vritra is also known in the Vedas as Ahi ( ). He appears as a human-like serpent blocking the course of the Rigvedic rivers, and is slain by Indra with his newly forged vajra.

==Etymology==

&quot;Vritra&quot; literally means &quot;cover, obstacle&quot;, in reference of him holding back the waters. It stems from Proto-Indo-Iranian &quot;*wr̥trás&quot;, from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*wer-&quot; &quot;to cover, to obstruct&quot;. The Indo-Iranian word is also found in Avestan as &quot;vərəθraγna&quot; (Vedic &quot;vṛtraghná&quot;), literally &quot;(one who) slays obstacles&quot;. Functionally, he is related to Jörmungandr of Norse myth, Typhon of Greek myth, and Veles of Slavic myth.

==Literature ==

=== Vedas ===

According to the Rig Veda, Vritra kept the waters of the world captive until he was killed by Indra, who destroyed all the 99 fortresses of Vritra (although the fortresses are sometimes attributed to Sambara) before liberating the imprisoned rivers. The combat began soon after Indra was born, and he consumed a large volume of Soma at Tvashtri&#x27;s house to empower him before facing Vritra. Tvashtri fashioned the thunderbolt (Vajrayudha) for Indra, and Vishnu, when asked to do so by Indra, made space for the battle by taking the three great strides, for which Vishnu became famous, and was later adapted in his legend of Vamana.

Vritra broke Indra&#x27;s two jaws during the battle, but was then thrown down by Indra and, in falling, crushed the fortresses that had already been shattered. For this feat, Indra became known as &quot;Vṛtrahan&quot; (lit. &quot;Slayer of Vritra&quot; and also as &quot;slayer of the first-born of dragons&quot;). Vritra&#x27;s mother, Danu, who was also the mother of the danava race of asuras, was then attacked and defeated by Indra with his thunderbolt. In one of the versions of the story, three devas – Varuna, Soma, and Agni – were coaxed by Indra into aiding him in the fight against Vritra, whereas before they had been on the side of Vritra (whom they called &quot;Father&quot;).

Hymn 18 of Mandala IV provides the most elaborate account of the Vedic version. The verses describe the events and circumstances leading up to the battle between Indra and Vritra, the battle itself, and the outcome of the battle.

As told in the narration given to King Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata, Vritra was an asura created by the artisan god Tvashtri to avenge the killing of his son by Indra, known as Triśiras or Viśvarūpa. Vritra won the battle and swallowed Indra, but the other deities forced him to vomit Indra out. The battle continued and Indra was eventually forced to flee. Vishnu and the rishis (sages) brokered a truce, with Indra swearing that he would not attack Vritra with anything made of metal, wood or stone, nor anything that was dry or wet, or during the day or the night. Indra used the foam (which Vishnu had entered to ensure victory) from the waves of the ocean to kill him at twilight.

The Srimad Bhagavatam recognizes Vritra as a bhakta (devotee) of Vishnu who was slain only due to his failure to live piously and without aggression. This story runs thus:

SB 6.9.11: After Visvarupa was killed, his father, Tvashta, performed ritualistic ceremonies to kill Indra. He offered oblations in the sacrificial fire, saying, &quot;O enemy of Indra, flourish to kill your enemy without delay.&quot;

SB 6.9.12: Thereafter, from the southern side of the sacrificial fire known as Anvaharya came a fearful personality who looked like the destroyer of the entire creation at the end of the millennium.

SB 6.9.13-17: Like arrows released in the four directions, the demon&#x27;s body grew, day after day. Tall and blackish, he appeared like a burnt hill and was as lustrous as a bright array of clouds in the evening. The hair on the demon&#x27;s body and his beard and moustache were the colour of melted copper, and his eyes were piercing like the midday sun. He appeared unconquerable as if holding the three worlds on the points of his blazing trident. Dancing and shouting with a loud voice, he made the entire surface of the earth tremble as if from an earthquake. As he yawned, again and again, he seemed to be trying to swallow the whole sky with his mouth, which was as deep as a cave. He seemed to be licking up all the stars in the sky with his tongue and eating the entire universe with his long, sharp teeth. Seeing this gigantic demon, everyone, in great fear, ran here and there in all directions.

SB 6.9.18: That very fearful demon, who was actually the son of Tvashta, covered all the planetary systems by dint of austerity. Therefore, he was named Vritra, or one who covers everything.

Vritra became the head of the asuras (portrayed as inherently malicious here, as opposed to the Vedic version, in which they may be benevolent or malevolent). He renounced his dharma – duty – to do good unto others and turned to violence, battling with the devas. Eventually, he gained the upper hand, and the devas were frightened of his evil might. Led by Indra, they approached Vishnu for help. He told them that Vritra could not be destroyed by ordinary means, revealing that only a weapon made from the bones of a sage could slay him. When the deities revealed their doubts about the likelihood of any ascetic donating his body, Vishnu directed them to approach the rishi Dadhichi. When approached by the deities, Dadhichi gladly gave up his bones for the cause of the good, stating that it would be better for his bones to help them attain victory than to rot in the ground. The devas collected the bones and Indra crafted the Vajrayudha from them. When they engaged Vritra again, the battle lasted for 360 days before Vritra breathed his last.

In Vaishnavism, Vritra is depicted to be a devotee of Vishnu. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, when the vajra-armed Indra and the devas battle against Vritra and his asuras, the Vritra proclaims that were he to fall in battle, he would be blessed, since the vajra was imbued with the power of Vishnu and Dadhichi. During the single combat between Indra and Vritra, the former drops his vajra when he is struck on the cheek. Even as the devas gasp, Vritra merely advises him to pick up his weapon, since life and death are the same for him, as he believes that they are all instruments of Vishnu. Indra marvels at the asura&#x27;s devotion to the preserver deity. When the king of the devas succeeds in slicing both of his opponent&#x27;s arms, the latter swallows him whole, along with Airavata. Protected by Vishnu, Indra cuts open the belly of Vritra and escapes, finally beheading him with the vajra. Vritra ascends to Vaikuntha upon his death.

According to the Puranas, the terrible anthropomorphic personification of Brāhmanahatya (Brahmanicide) chased Indra and forced him into hiding for his sin, and Nahusha was invited to take his place.

==Buddhism==
In the Pali Canon, Vritra is alluded to when the Buddha addresses Śakra with the title &quot;Vatrabhū.&quot;

<text>Trishiras (), also referred to as Vishvarupa, was the three-headed son of the craftsman god Tvashta. He was killed by Indra, the king of the devas. To avenge his death, Tvashta later created the demon Vritra.

==In Hindu Scriptures==
===Vedic===
In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Vishvarupa is the son of the god Tvashta and the guardian of cows. He is an enemy of Indra, the king of the gods, who comes into conflict with him. Indra is victorious in the conflict and Aptya (an ally of Indra) kills Vishvarupa and is later beheaded by Indra. Another verse states that Indra stole Vishvarupa&#x27;s cattle and released them. The &quot;Brihaddevata&quot; narrates that Vishvarupa is the son of Tvashta and his asura wife, and the twin of Saranyu. He is sent by the demons to become the priest of the devas, desiring to destroy them. Indra suspected his intentions and beheaded him. His three heads turn into three different birds. Furious by the demise of his son, Tvashtr creates a demon called Vritra to avenge his death.

===Epic and Puranic===
According to the &quot;Udyoga Parva&quot; of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Tvashta had a conflict with Indra and wanted to dethrone him. With his wife Virocana (or Rechana), who was the daughter of Prahlada and belonged to Asura race, Tvashta had Trishiras, who was born with three heads. His three heads were each named &quot;Somapītha&quot;, &quot;Surāpītha&quot;, and &quot;Annāda&quot; as each head consumed Soma, Sura, and food, respectively. It is also told that one head was responsible for drinking; with another head, he observed his surroundings; and with his last head, he read the Vedas. Trishiras grew powerful and performed penance to become more powerful. Indra became frightened of him, and sent Apsaras (nymphs) to seduce him and break his penance. However, Trisharas was unaffected and Indra went to him and killed him using his thunderbolt. He was concerned about the possibility of Trishiras reviving, so he sent a carpenter to cut off each of his heads. From the head that chanted Vedic mantras rose the Kapiñjala birds; from the head used for drinking soma rose the Kalapiṅga birds and from the third head rose the Tittiri birds. Tvashta performed a yajna, from which Vritra emerged to avenge Trishiras&#x27;s death.

The &quot;Shanti Parva&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, &quot;Brahmavaivarta Purana&quot; narrates a different myth about Vishvarupa and portray him as a guru or priest of Indra. According to this version, Brihaspati, the guru of the devas (gods), refused to perform yajna (sacrifice) after he was insulted by Indra. This led the devas to lose to their enemies, the Asuras. On the advice of the creator god Brahma, Indra appointed Vishvarupa, the son of Tvashta and Rechana, as the new priest of the sacrifice. However, Vishvarupa was also related to the Asuras through his mother and didn&#x27;t perform the sacrifice appropriately. Indra suspected his allegiance and beheaded Vishvarupa.

These texts state that Indra sinned &quot;Brahmanahatya&quot; (murder of a Brahman) for killing Trishiras, who was both a Brahama and his guru. The &quot;Brahmavaivarta Purana&quot; also attests that Vishvarupa had a son named Sutapa.

<doc id="99794" wikidata="Q422321" url="?curid=99794" title="Blueprint">
<text>A blueprint is a reproduction of a technical drawing or engineering drawing using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets introduced by Sir John Herschel in 1842. The process allowed rapid and accurate production of an unlimited number of copies. It was widely used for over a century for the reproduction of specification drawings used in construction and industry. Blueprints were characterized by white lines on a blue background, a negative of the original. Color or shades of grey could not be reproduced.

The process is obsolete, largely displaced by the diazo-based &quot;whiteprint&quot; process, and later by large-format xerographic photocopiers. It has almost entirely been superseded by digital computer-aided construction drawings.

The term &quot;&quot; continues to be used informally to refer to any floor plan (and by analogy, ). Practising engineers, architects, and drafters often call them &quot;drawings&quot;, &quot;prints&quot;, or &quot;plans&quot;.

==The blueprint process==

The blueprint process is based on a photosensitive ferric compound. The best known is a process using ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide. The paper is impregnated with a solution of ammonium ferric citrate and dried. When the paper is illuminated, a photoreaction turns the trivalent ferric iron into divalent ferrous iron. The image is then developed using a solution of potassium ferricyanide forming insoluble ferroferricyanide (Prussian blue or Turnbull&#x27;s blue) with the divalent iron. Excess ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide are then washed away. The process is also known as cyanotype.

This is a simple process for the reproduction of any light transmitting document. Engineers and architects drew their designs on cartridge paper; these were then traced on to tracing paper using India ink for reproduction whenever needed. The tracing paper drawing is placed on top of the sensitized paper, and both are clamped under glass, in a daylight exposure frame, which is similar to a picture frame. The frame is put out into daylight, requiring a minute or two under a bright sun, or about thirty minutes under an overcast sky to complete the exposure. Where ultra-violet light is transmitted through the tracing paper, the light-sensitive coating converts to a stable blue or black dye. Where the India ink blocks the ultra-violet light the coating does not convert and remains soluble. The image can be seen forming. When a strong image is seen the frame is brought indoors to stop the process. The unconverted coating is washed away, and the paper is then dried. The result is a copy of the original image with the clear background area rendered dark blue and the image reproduced as a white line.

This process has several features:

Introduction of the blueprint process eliminated the expense of photolithographic reproduction or of hand-tracing of original drawings. By the later 1890s in American architectural offices, a blueprint was one-tenth the cost of a hand-traced reproduction. The blueprint process is still used for special artistic and photographic effects, on paper and fabrics.

Various base materials have been used for blueprints. Paper was a common choice; for more durable prints linen was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly. To combat this problem, printing on imitation vellum and, later, polyester film (Mylar) was implemented.

==Whiteprints==
Traditional blueprints became obsolete when less expensive printing methods and digital displays became available.

In the early 1940s, cyanotype blueprint began to be supplanted by diazo prints, also known as whiteprints. This technique produces blue lines on a white background. The drawings are also called &quot;blue-lines&quot; or bluelines. Other comparable dye-based prints were known as blacklines. Diazo prints remained in use until they were replaced by xerographic print processes.

Xerography is standard copy machine technology using toner on copy paper. When large size xerography machines became available, 1975, they replaced the older printing methods. As computer-aided design techniques came into use, the designs were printed directly using a computer printer or plotter.

==Digital==
In most computer-aided design of parts to be machined, paper is avoided altogether, and the finished design is an image on the computer display. The computer-aided design program generates a computer numerical control sequence from the approved design. The sequence is a computer file which will control the operation of the machine tools used to make the part.

In the case of construction plans, such as road work or erecting a building, the supervising workers may view the &quot;blueprints&quot; directly on displays, rather than using printed paper sheets. These displays include mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets. Software allows users to view and annotate electronic drawing files. Construction crews use software in the field to edit, share, and view blueprint documents in real-time.

Many of the original paper blueprints are archived since they are still in use. In many situations their conversion to digital form is prohibitively expensive. Most buildings and roads constructed before 1990 will only have paper blueprints, not digital. These originals have significant importance to the repair and alteration of constructions still in use, e.g. bridges, buildings, sewer systems, roads, railroads, etc., and sometimes in legal matters concerning the determination of, for example, property boundaries, or who owns or is responsible for a boundary wall.

<doc id="99799" wikidata="Q822524" url="?curid=99799" title="Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner">
<text>Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of animated cartoons, first appearing in 1949 in the theatrical short &quot;Fast and Furry-ous&quot;. In each film, the cunning, devious and constantly hungry coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and eat the roadrunner, but is humorously unsuccessful. Instead of using animal instinct, the coyote deploys absurdly complex schemes and devices to try to catch his prey. They comically backfire, with the coyote invariably getting injured in slapstick fashion. Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from the Acme Corporation and other companies. &quot;TV Guide&quot; included Wile E. Coyote in its 2013 list of &quot;The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time&quot;.

The characters were created for Warner Bros. in 1948 by Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese, with Maltese also setting the template for their adventures. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-television cartoons. Originally meant to parody chase-cartoon characters such as &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, they became popular in their own right. By 2014, 49 cartoons had been made featuring the characters (including the four CGI shorts), the majority by Jones.

==History==

=== Conception ===
Jones based the coyote on Mark Twain&#x27;s book &quot;Roughing It&quot;, in which Twain described the coyote as &quot;a long, slim, sick and sorry-looking skeleton&quot; that is &quot;a living, breathing allegory of Want. He is &quot;always&quot; hungry.&quot; Jones said he created the Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoons as a parody of traditional &quot;cat and mouse&quot; cartoons such as MGM&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. He also cites Frank Tashlin&#x27;s 1941 adaptation of &quot;The Fox and the Grapes&quot; as inspiration due to its use of blackout gags. Jones modelled the coyote&#x27;s appearance on fellow animator Ken Harris.

The coyote&#x27;s name of Wile E. is a pun of the word &quot;wily&quot;. The &quot;E&quot; stands for &quot;Ethelbert&quot; in one issue of a Looney Tunes comic book. The coyote&#x27;s surname is routinely pronounced with a long &quot;e&quot; ( ), but in one cartoon short, &quot;To Hare Is Human&quot;, Wile E. is heard pronouncing it with a diphthong ( ). Early model sheets for the character prior to his initial appearance (in &quot;Fast and Furry-ous&quot;) identified him as &quot;Don Coyote&quot;, a pun on Don Quixote.

The Road Runner&#x27;s &quot;beep, beep&quot; sound was inspired by background artist Paul Julian&#x27;s imitation of a car horn. Julian voiced the various recordings of the phrase used throughout the Road Runner cartoons, although he was not credited for his work on screen. According to animation historian Michael Barrier, Julian&#x27;s preferred spelling of the sound effect was either &quot;hmeep hmeep&quot; or &quot;mweep, mweep.&quot;

In the main series, Wile E. does not speak, instead portrayed as a mute character who communicates with the use of signs. However he does speak in the 1965 short &quot;Zip Zip Hooray!&quot;, where he explains his desire to eat the Road Runner.

=== Scenery ===

The desert scenery in the first three Road Runner cartoons, &quot;Fast and Furry-ous&quot; (1949), &quot;Beep, Beep&quot; (1952), and &quot;Going! Going! Gosh!&quot; (also 1952), was designed by Robert Gribbroek and was quite realistic. In most later cartoons, the scenery was designed by Maurice Noble and was far more abstract. It is based on the deserts of the Southwestern United States.

=== Acme Corporation ===

Wile E. Coyote often obtains various complex and ludicrous devices from a mail-order company, the fictitious Acme Corporation, which he hopes will help him catch the Road Runner. The devices invariably fail in improbable and spectacular fashion.

In August, September and October 1982, the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; published a three-part series chronicling the lawsuit Wile E. filed against the Acme Corporation over the faulty items they sold him in his pursuit of the Road Runner. Even though the Road Runner appeared as a witness for the plaintiff, the coyote still lost the suit.

=== Laws and Rules ===
In his book &quot;Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist&quot;, Chuck Jones claimed that he and the artists behind the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote cartoons adhered to some simple but strict rules:
# &quot;The Road Runner cannot harm the Coyote except by going &#x27;Beep-Beep!&#x27;&quot;
# &quot;No outside force can harm the Coyote — only his own ineptitude or the failure of the Acme products.&quot;
# &quot;The Coyote could stop anytime — &quot;if&quot; he were not a fanatic. (Repeat: &#x27;A fanatic is one who redoubles his effort when he has forgotten his aim.&#x27; — George Santayana).&quot;
# &quot;No dialogue ever, except &#x27;Beep-Beep!&#x27;&quot;
# &quot;The Road Runner must stay on the road — otherwise, logically, he would not be called a Road Runner.&quot;
# &quot;All action must be confined to the natural environment of the two characters — the southwest American desert.&quot;
# &quot;All materials tools, weapons, or mechanical conveniences must be obtained from the Acme Corporation.&quot;
# &quot;Whenever possible, make gravity the Coyote&#x27;s greatest enemy.&quot;
# &quot;The Coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures.&quot;

These rules were not always followed, and in an interview years after the series was made, principal writer of the original 16 episodes Michael Maltese stated he had never heard of these or any &quot;rules&quot; and dismissed them as &quot;post production observation&quot;.

=== Running Gags ===

In many of the shorts, a cartoon typically starts with Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner in a desperate attempt to catch him, only for the Road Runner to zip away in breakneck speed, much to the Coyote&#x27;s surprise and utter amazement. 

One notable running gag involves the Coyote falling from high cliffs; after momentarily being suspended in midair, as if the fall is delayed until he realizes that there is nothing below him. The rest of the scene, shot from a bird&#x27;s-eye view, shows him falling into a canyon so deep that his figure is eventually lost to sight, with only a small puff of dust indicating his impact. 

The coyote is notably a brilliant artist, capable of quickly painting lifelike renderings of such things as tunnels and roadside scenes, in further (and equally futile) attempts to deceive the bird. Additionally, another running gag involves the coyote trying, in vain, to shield himself with a little parasol against a great falling boulder that is about to crush him.

== Later Cartoons ==
The original Chuck Jones productions ended in 1963 after Jack L. Warner closed the Warner Bros. animation studio. &quot;War and Pieces&quot;, the last Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner short directed by Jones, was released on June 6, 1964. By that time, David H. DePatie and director Friz Freleng had formed DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, moved into the facility just emptied by Warner, and signed a license with Warner Bros. to produce cartoons for the big studio to distribute.

The first DePatie–Freleng cartoon to feature the Road Runner was &quot;The Wild Chase&quot;, directed by Freleng in 1965. The premise was a race between the bird and &quot;the fastest mouse in all México&quot;, Speedy Gonzales, with the Coyote and Sylvester the Cat each trying to make a meal out of their respective usual targets. Much of the material was animation rotoscoped from earlier Road Runner and Speedy Gonzales shorts, with the other characters added in. Additionally, DePatie-Freleng produced two cartoons (&quot;Zip Zip Hooray!&quot; (1965) and &quot;Road Runner a Go-Go&quot; (1965)) that reuses footage from Chuck Jones&#x27; 1962 television pilot &quot;Adventures of the Road Runner,&quot; with there original audio kept intact. DePatie-Freleng went on to produced 13 more &quot;Road Runner&quot; cartoons. Two of these shorts were produced in-house and were directed by Robert McKimson (&quot;Rushing Roulette&quot; (1965) and &quot;Sugar and Spies&quot; (1966)), while the remaining eleven, directed by Rudy Larriva, were outsourced to Format Films. 

Format&#x27;s &quot;Road Runner&quot; cartoons, nicknamed the &quot;Larriva Eleven&quot;, were characterized for its poorer production quality when compared to DePatie-Freleng, with animation often being reused in nearly every cartoon. The music was also of poorer quality, as the soundtrack (composed by Bill Lava) was relegated to the use of pre-composed music cues rather than a proper score, the only exception of this being &quot;Run Run, Sweet Road Runner&quot; (1965) as it was produced with a proper soundtrack. In addition, except for the planet Earth scene at the end of &quot;Highway Runnery (&quot;1965), there was only one clip of the Coyote&#x27;s fall to the ground, used over and over again. Jones&#x27; previously described &quot;laws&quot; for the characters were not followed with any significant fidelity, nor were Latin phrases used when introducing the characters. These 11 shorts have been considered inferior to the other Golden Age shorts, garnering mixed to poor reviews from critics. Leonard Maltin, in his book &quot;Of Mice and Magic&quot;, calls the series &quot;witless in every sense of the word&quot;.

===Post-Theatrical Appearences===
The Road Runner and the Coyote appeared on Saturday mornings as the stars of their own TV series, &quot;The Road Runner Show&quot;, from September 1966 to September 1968, on CBS. At this time it was merged with &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; to become &quot;The Bugs Bunny and Road Runner Show&quot;, running from 1968 to 1985. The show was later seen on ABC until 2000, and on Global until 2001.

In the 1970s, Chuck Jones directed some Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner short films for the educational children&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. These short cartoons used the Coyote and the Road Runner to display words for children to read.

In 1979, &quot;Freeze Frame&quot;, in which Jones moved the chase from the desert to snow-covered mountains, was seen as part of &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Looney Christmas Tales&quot;.

At the end of Bugs Bunny&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Bunny&quot; (the initial sequence of Chuck Jones&#x27; TV special &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Bustin&#x27; Out All Over&quot;), Bugs mentions to the audience that he and Elmer Fudd may have been the first pair of characters to have chase scenes in these cartoons, but then a pint-sized baby Wile E. Coyote (wearing a diaper and holding a small knife and fork) runs right in front of Bugs, chasing a gold-colored, mostly unhatched (except for the tail, which is sticking out) Road Runner egg, which is running rapidly while some high-pitched &quot;Beep, beep&quot; noises can be heard. This was followed by the full-fledged Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote short &quot;Soup or Sonic&quot;. Earlier in that story, while kid Elmer was falling from a cliff, Wile E. Coyote&#x27;s adult self tells him to move over and leave falling to people who know how to do it and then he falls, followed by Elmer.

In the 1980s, ABC began showing many Warner Bros. shorts, but in highly edited form. Many scenes integral to the stories were taken out, including scenes in which Wile E. Coyote landed at the bottom of the canyon after falling from a cliff, or had a boulder or anvil actually make contact with him. In almost all WB animated features, scenes where a character&#x27;s face was burnt and black, some thought resembling blackface, were removed, as were animated characters smoking cigarettes. Some cigar-smoking scenes were left in. The unedited versions of these shorts (with the exception of ones with blackface) were not seen again until Cartoon Network, and later Boomerang, began showing them again in the 1990s and early 2000s. Since the release of the WB library of cartoons on DVD, the cartoons gradually disappeared from television, presumably to increase sales of the DVDs. However, Cartoon Network began to air them again in 2011, coinciding with the premiere of &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (2011), and the shorts were afterward moved to Boomerang, where they have remained to this day.

Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner appeared in several episodes of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;. In this series, Wile E. (voiced in the Jim Reardon episode &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; by Joe Alaskey) was the dean of Acme Looniversity and the mentor of Calamity Coyote. The Road Runner&#x27;s protégé in this series was Little Beeper. In the episode &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;, Wile E. narrates the life story of Calamity while Calamity is falling from the top of a tall skyscraper. In the direct-to-video film &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation&quot;, the Road Runner finally gets a taste of humiliation by getting run over by a mail truck that &quot;brakes for coyotes&quot;.

The two were also seen in cameos in &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. They were together in two &quot;Slappy Squirrel&quot; cartoons: &quot;Bumbie&#x27;s Mom&quot; and &quot;Little Old Slappy from Pasadena&quot;. In the latter, the Road Runner gets another taste of humiliation when he is out-run by Slappy&#x27;s car, and holds up a sign saying &quot;I quit&quot; — immediately afterward, Buttons, who was launched into the air during a previous gag, lands squarely on top of him. Wile E. appears without the bird in a &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; parody, dressed in his batsuit from one short, in a twister (tornado) funnel in &quot;Buttons in Ows&quot; Also, in the beginning of one episode, an artist is seen drawing the Road Runner.

The Road Runner appears in an episode of the 1991 series &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;, in which Taz grabs him by the leg and gets ready to eat him, until the two gators are ready to capture Taz, so he lets the Road Runner go. In another episode of &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;, the Road Runner cartoons are parodied, with Taz dressed as the Road Runner and the character Willy Wombat dressed as Wile E. Coyote. Willy tries to catch Taz with Acme Roller Skates but fails, and Taz even says &quot;Beep, beep.&quot;

Wile E. and the Road Runner would also make an appearence in the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot;, where they, along with the read of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters, must win against invading aliens through basketball with the help of Michael Jordan. They would also appear in its 2021 sequel &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;.

Wile E. and the Road Runner would return to theatrical shorts in toddler form in the 2000 theatrical short &quot;Little Go Beep&quot;, and later in &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, but only in songs. However, they both had made a cameo in the episode &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;, where the Road Runner was seen out the window of Floyd&#x27;s car with Wile E. chasing him.

Wile E. Coyote had a cameo as the true identity of an alien hunter (a parody of &quot;Predator&quot;) in the &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; episode &quot;K-9 Quarry&quot;, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. In that episode, he was hunting Martian Commander X-2 and K-9. He is also temporary as a member of Agent Roboto&#x27;s Legion of Duck Doom from the previous season in another episode.

In &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot;, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner&#x27;s 28th century descendants are Tech E. Coyote (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) and Rev Runner (voiced by Rob Paulsen). Tech E. Coyote was the tech expert of the Loonatics (influenced by the past cartoons with many of the machines ordered by Wile E. from Acme), and has magnetic hands and the ability to molecularly regenerate himself (influenced by the many times in which Wile E. painfully failed to capture the Road Runner and then was shown to have miraculously recovered). Tech E. Coyote speaks, but does not have a transatlantic accent as Wile E. Coyote did. Rev Runner is also able to talk, though extremely rapidly, and can fly without the use of jet packs, which are used by other members of the Loonatics. He also has sonic speed, also a take-off of the Road Runner. The pair get on rather well, despite the number of gadgets Tech designs in order to stop Rev from talking, also they have their moments where they do not get along. When friendship is shown it is often only from Rev to Tech, not the other way around, this could, however, be attributed to the fact that Tech has only the barest minimum of social skills. They are both portrayed as smart, but Tech is the better inventor and at times Rev is shown doing stupid things. References to their ancestors&#x27; past are seen in the episode &quot;Family Business&quot; where the other Road Runners are wary of Tech and Tech relives the famous falling gags done in the Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner shorts.

The Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote feature in 3D computer-animated cartoons or cartoon animation in the Cartoon Network TV series &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;. The CGI shorts were only included in Season 1, but Wile E. and the Road Runner still appeared throughout the series in 2D animation.

Wile E. Coyote also appears in the TV series &quot;Wabbit&quot;, voiced by J. P. Karliak, in a similar vein to his previous pairings with Bugs Bunny. He appears as Bugs&#x27; annoying know-it-all neighbor who always uses his inventions to compete with Bugs. The Road Runner began making appearances when the series was renamed &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; in 2017.

Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner both appear in their own cartoon shorts in the HBO Max streaming series &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;.

Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner make occasional appearances in the preschool educational series &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot;. Wile E. (voiced by Keith Ferguson) has a minor supporting role in the series in which he often helps the Looney Builders out with their plans, often using some of his inventions. In the episode &quot;Looney Science&quot;, Wile E. has the Looney Builders build him a science museum to show off his inventions, but the Road Runner keeps constantly distracting him.

Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner appear in the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; reboot, &quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot;, as well as their protégés from the original series Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper. In this series Wile E. is the science professor at Acme Looniversity rather than the dean. In the episode &quot;General Hogspital&quot;, Wile E. develops a potion that makes toons lose their looney DNA to try and finally catch the Road Runner, only for it to backfire and pollute the campus water supply.

Wile E. Coyote was also in an episode of &quot;Night Court&quot; (Season 7, Episode 22: &quot;Sill Another Day in the Life&quot;) in which Judge Harold T. Stone (Harry Anderson) found him guilty of harassment and told him to leave the poor bird alone.

===3-D shorts===
The characters appeared in seven 3-D shorts attached to Warner Bros. features. Three have been screened with features, while the rest serve as segments in season 1 of &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;. A short called &quot;Flash in the Pain&quot; was shown on the web in 2014, but was not shown in theaters until 2016, when the movie &quot;Storks&quot; premiered.

==&quot;Coyote vs. Acme&quot;==
In late 2018, it was announced that Warner Bros. Pictures were developing a live-action animated film centered on Wile E. Coyote titled &quot;Coyote vs. Acme&quot;, produced by Warner Animation Group, with &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; director Chris McKay on board to produce. The film is said to be based on &quot;The New Yorker&quot; short story &quot;Coyote v. Acme&quot; by author Ian Frazier. Published in 1990, the piece imagined a lawsuit brought about by Wile E. Coyote against the Acme Company who provided him with various devices and tools to aid in his pursuit of the Road Runner. The devices frequently malfunctioned, leading to the humorous failures, injuries, and sight gags for which the Road Runner cartoons are known. Jon and Josh Silberman were originally set to write the screenplay. On December 18, 2019, it was reported that Dave Green would direct the project. It was also reported that the project was looking for a new writer, with Jon and Josh Silberman instead co-producing the film alongside McKay. However, by December 2020, McKay departed the project, while Jon and Josh Silberman left their roles as producers and resumed their screenwriting roles, with Samy Burch, Jeremy Slater, and James Gunn scheduled to write its screenplay. Gunn would have also co-produced the project alongside Chris DeFaria. It was later announced that the film was scheduled to be released on July 21, 2023.

In February 2022, it was announced that professional wrestler John Cena would star in the film. In March 2022, Will Forte and Lana Condor were added to the cast. On April 26, 2022, it was taken off the release schedule with &quot;Barbie&quot; taking over its original release date. Despite its completion by November 9, 2023, it was announced that its theatrical and public release would be cancelled, with the company taking an approximately US$30 million tax write-off for the film. Consistent with its long-term production issues and delays, Green later expressed his views on the decision:

However, four days later, the decision was reversed. Later that day, it was reported that Warner Bros. would instead allow the crew behind &quot;Coyote vs. Acme&quot; to shop out the film to other possible distributors, with Apple TV+, Netflix, and Amazon MGM Studios being among its potential buyers. Due to the company&#x27;s handling of the matter, U.S. Congressman Joaquin Castro called for a federal investigation regarding the film&#x27;s initial cancellation and tax-write off plan, stemming from possible violations of antitrust guidelines.

On December 8, it was reported that the film had been screened to Paramount Pictures, Netflix, Apple, Amazon, and Sony Pictures. So far, two of these studios, Netflix and Paramount, have made bids for the rights to the film, with the latter planning to release it theatrically. Amazon is still considering about making a formal bid, while Sony and Apple have declined the offer to bid.

On December 31, Eric Bauza unveiled an official screenshot of the film on social media, depicting Wile E. Coyote and his lawyer seated in the courtroom, all while the film continued to search for a new distributor.

==Spin-offs and other media==
The coyote appears separately as an occasional antagonist of Bugs Bunny in five shorts from 1952 to 1963: &quot;&quot;, &quot;To Hare Is Human&quot;, &quot;Rabbit&#x27;s Feat&quot;, &quot;Compressed Hare&quot;, and &quot;Hare-Breadth Hurry&quot;. While he is generally silent in the Wile E. Coyote – Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined accent in these solo outings (except for &quot;Hare-Breadth Hurry&quot;), beginning with 1952&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, introducing himself as &quot;Wile E. Coyote, (Super) Genius&quot;, voiced by Mel Blanc. &quot;Hare-Breadth Hurry&quot; in particular stands out as the short uses the framework of a typical Road Runner cartoon, but with Bugs as the substitute since the former had &quot;sprained a giblet cornering a sharp curve the other day.&quot;

In another series of Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons, Chuck Jones used the character design (model sheets and personality) of Wile E. Coyote as &quot;Ralph Wolf&quot;. In this series, Ralph continually attempts to steal sheep from a flock being guarded by the eternally vigilant Sam Sheepdog. As with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote series, Ralph Wolf uses all sorts of wild inventions and schemes to steal the sheep, but he is continually foiled by the sheepdog. In a move seen by many as a self-referential gag, Ralph Wolf continually tries to steal the sheep not because he is a fanatic (as Wile E. Coyote was), but because it is his job. In every cartoon, he and Sam Sheepdog punch a timeclock and exchange pleasantries, go to work, stop what they are doing to take a lunch break, go back to work and pick up right where they left off, and clock out to go home for the day and exchange pleasantries again, all according to a factory-like blowing whistle. The most obvious difference between the coyote and the wolf, aside from their locales, is that Wile E. has a black nose and Ralph has a red nose.

===Comic books===
Wile E. Coyote was called Kelsey Coyote in his comic book debut, a Henery Hawk story in &quot;Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies&quot; #91 (May 1949). He only made a couple of other appearances at this time and did not have his official name yet, as it was not used until 1952 (in &quot;&quot;, his second appearance).

The first appearance of the Road Runner in a comic book was in &quot;Bugs Bunny Vacation Funnies&quot; #8 (August 1958) published by Dell Comics. The feature is titled &quot;Beep Beep the Road Runner&quot; and the story &quot;Desert Dessert&quot;. It presents itself as the first meeting between Beep Beep and Wile E. (whose mailbox reads &quot;Wile E. Coyote, Inventor and Genius&quot;), and introduces the Road Runner&#x27;s wife, Matilda, and their three newly hatched sons (though Matilda soon disappeared from the comics). This story established the convention that the Road Runner family talked in rhyme, a convention that also appeared in early children&#x27;s book adaptations of the cartoons.

Dell initially published a dedicated &quot;Beep Beep the Road Runner&quot; comic as part of &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #918, 1008, and 1046 before launching a separate series for the character numbered #4–14 (1960–1962), with the three try-out issues counted as the first three numbers. After a hiatus, Gold Key Comics took over the character with issues #1–88 (1966–1984). During the 1960s, the artwork was done by Pete Alvarado and Phil DeLara, from 1966 to 1969, the Gold Key issues consisted of Dell reprints. Afterward, new stories began to appear, initially drawn by Alvarado and De Lara before Jack Manning became the main artist for the title. New and reprinted Beep Beep stories also appeared in &quot;Golden Comics Digest&quot; and Gold Key&#x27;s revival of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; in the 1970s. During this period, Wile E.&#x27;s middle name was revealed to be &quot;Ethelbert&quot; in the story &quot;The Greatest of E&#x27;s&quot; in issue #53 (cover-dated September 1975) of Gold Key Comics&#x27; licensed comic book &quot;Beep Beep the Road Runner&quot;.

The Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote also make appearances in the DC Comics &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; title. Wile E. was able to speak in some of his appearances in the DC comics.

In 2017, DC Comics featured a &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and DC Comics crossovers that reimagined the characters in a darker style. The Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote had a crossover with the intergalactic bounty hunter Lobo in &quot;Lobo/Road Runner Special&quot; #1. In this version, the Road Runner, Wile E., and other Looney Tunes characters are reimagined as standard animals who were experimented upon with alien DNA at Acme to transform them into their cartoon forms. In the back-up story, done in more traditional cartoon style, Lobo tries to hunt down the Road Runner, but is limited by Bugs to be more kid-friendly in his language and approach.

==In popular culture==
There are two scenes in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 adaptation of &quot;The Shining&quot; where Danny Torrance and his mother, Wendy Torrance, are watching the cartoons.

Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner appeared in the 1988 Touchstone/Amblin film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. They are first seen silhouetted by the elevator doors in Toontown, and then in full in the ACME Factory during the final scene with other characters.

The 1979 Western comedy film &quot;The Villain&quot; is a tribute to the cartoons, reconstructing several famous gags in live action.

In the &quot;Fraidy Cat&quot; episode &quot;Choo Choo Fraidy&quot;, Fraidy Cat meets a coyote named Smile E. Coyote who prefers to not eat Fraidy and instead goes after an overweight jogging roadrunner, clearly parodying the iconic duo.

In the 1992 film &quot;Under Siege&quot;, &quot;Road Runner&quot; is the code name of the renegade former CIA operative William Strannix, played by Tommy Lee Jones, in a reference to the fact that the character is never captured.

Wile E. Coyote has appeared twice in &quot;Family Guy&quot;: his first episode, &quot;I Never Met the Dead Man&quot;, depicts him riding in a car with Peter Griffin, when Peter runs over the Road Runner and asks if he hit &quot;that ostrich&quot;, Wile E. tells him to keep going. His second appearance was in &quot;PTV&quot;, in which Wile E. attempts to get a refund for a giant-sized slingshot at an ACME retailer where Peter works.

Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner appeared in &quot;Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy&quot; in the short &quot;Die, Sweet Roadrunner, Die&quot;. In this short, Wile E. crushes the Road Runner with a large boulder and eats him, but then struggles to find purpose in life, having not trained for anything else other than chasing the Road Runner. Ultimately, after a short-lived job as a waiter in a local diner, and a suicide attempt (by way of catapulting himself into a mountain at close range), Wile E. finally realizes what he is to do with his life, and reveals he is now an advocate for Christianity.

The Road Runner appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; in which Peter Griffin straps a rocket to his back in a similar fashion of Wile E. Coyote and attempts to catch the Road Runner, only to wreck Cleveland Brown&#x27;s house again, prompting Cleveland to finally decide to leave Quahog.

Both Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner have appeared in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; on multiple occasions. One sketch sees Wile E. faking his own suicide and then torching the Road Runner with a flamethrower when he shows up at Wile E.&#x27;s &quot;funeral&quot;. Another sketch shows Wile E. teaching a college course on how to get away with murder, using the Road Runner&#x27;s murder as an example, the students trace the mail orders for the ACME products used to commit the murder to Wile E., who is executed by electric chair for the crime. Another sketch sees Wile E. presenting his iconic &quot;fake tunnel&quot; at an art auction, and another reveals why Wile E.&#x27;s ACME products always fail - the ACME Corporation is run by multiple Road Runners.

Wile E. Coyote appeared during the couch gag in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Smoke on the Daughter&quot; in which he paints a fake couch on the living room wall which the Simpson family run into. Maggie Simpson then zooms in and imitates the Road Runner&#x27;s &quot;beep, beep&quot; noise. The Road Runner appeared in the episode &quot;Crystal Blue-Haired Persuasion&quot; during a dream sequence in which he is attacked and eaten by the Space Coyote.

Guitarist Mark Knopfler recorded a song called &quot;Coyote&quot; in homage to the cartoon shows of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner on the 2002 album &quot;The Ragpicker&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The Tom Smith song &quot;Operation: Desert Storm&quot;, which won a Pegasus award for Best Fool Song in 1999, is about the different ways the coyote&#x27;s plans fail.

The music videos for Twisted Sister&#x27;s signature songs &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; were based heavily on the cartoon.

Humorist Ian Frazier created the mock-legal prose piece &quot;Coyote v. Acme&quot;, which is included in a book of the same name.

During a scene in &quot;The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie!&quot;, the &quot;Drawn Together&quot; cast accidentally run over and kill the Road Runner with Foxxy Love&#x27;s van. Upon noticing this, Wile E. Coyote runs up to the Road Runner&#x27;s corpse and declares &quot;Without you, my life really has no meaning&quot;, before shooting himself with a &quot;Bang!&quot; flag gun.

Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner appear in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode, &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;. They are among the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters as guests for the Warner Bros. centennial celebration.

<doc id="99801" wikidata="Q3927111" url="?curid=99801" title="Quarter days">
<text>In British and Irish tradition, the quarter days are the four dates in each year on which servants were hired, school terms started, and rents were due. They fell on four religious festivals roughly three months apart and close to the two solstices and two equinoxes.

The significance of quarter days is now limited, although rents for properties in England are often still due on the old English quarter days.

The quarter days have been observed at least since the Middle Ages, and they ensured that debts and unresolved lawsuits were not allowed to linger on. Accounts had to be settled, and a reckoning had to be made and publicly recorded on the quarter days.

==England and Wales==
The English quarter days (also observed in Wales and the Channel Islands) are
*Lady Day (25 March, the Feast of the Annunciation);
*Midsummer Day (24 June, the Feast of the Nativity of St John the Baptist);
*Michaelmas Day (29 September, the Feast of St Michael and All Angels); and
*Christmas Day (25 December, the Feast of the Nativity of Jesus).

Falling close to the Spring equinox, Lady Day was the first day of the civil year in England, Wales and the British dominions (but not Scotland) until 1752 (when it was harmonised with the Scottish practice of 1 January being New Year&#x27;s Day). The British (personal) tax year still ends on &quot;Old&quot; Lady Day (5 April under the &#x27;new style&#x27; (Gregorian) calendar, which in the 18th century corresponded to 25 March under the &#x27;old style&#x27; Julian calendar: the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 advanced the calendar by eleven days. 5 April is still the end of the British tax year for personal taxation.

The cross-quarter days are four holidays falling in between the quarter days: Candlemas (2 February), May Day (1 May), Lammas (1 August), and All Hallows (1 November). 

At many schools, class terms would begin on the quarter days; for example, the autumn term would start on 29 September, and thus continues to be called the Michaelmas term, especially at more traditional universities.

==Ireland==

Prior to the Christianisation of Ireland in the 5th century AD, the Celtic quarter days were observed:

*Imbolc (February 1)
*Beltaine (May 1)
*Lughnasadh (August 1)
*Samhain (November 1)

These are now called cross-quarter days since they fall about halfway into each of the English quarters.

Since 2022, when a holiday for Imbolc was added to the list, all four traditional Celtic quarter days are now marked in the Republic of Ireland by an annual public holiday on a Monday close to the quarter days.

==Scotland==
The &quot;Old Scottish term days&quot; corresponded approximately to the old Celtic quarter days:
* Candlemas (2 February)
* Whitsunday (legislatively fixed for this purpose as 15 May)
* Lammas (1 August)
* Martinmas (11 November).

These were also the dates of the Quarter Days observed in northern England until the 18th century.

The dates for removals and for the employment of servants of Whitsunday and Martinmas were changed in 1886 to 28 May and 28 November respectively. The Term and Quarter Days (Scotland) Act 1990 redefined the &quot;Scottish term days&quot;, in official use, as:
*28 February,
*28 May,
*28 August and
*28 November.
The Act specifies that the new dates take effect on 13 June 1991 (12 months from the date it was passed). Thus the Scottish term days, as days on which rents are paid, correspond more closely to the cross-quarter days than to the English quarter days.

==In other countries==
In late 18th century Germany, it was customary for property rentals to start on Easter or one of the quarter days being Midsummer Day, Michaelmas or Christmas.

<text>In the Western liturgical year, Lady Day is the common name in some English-speaking and Scandinavian countries of the Feast of the Annunciation, celebrated on 25 March to commemorate the annunciation of the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary that she would bear Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

==Religious significance==
The commemorated event is known in the 1549 prayer book of Edward VI and the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; as &quot;The Annunciation of the (Blessed) Virgin Mary&quot; but more accurately (as in the modern Calendar of the Church of England) termed &quot;The Annunciation of our Lord to the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;. It is the first of the four traditional English quarter days. The &quot;(Our) Lady&quot; is the Virgin Mary. The term derives from Middle English, when some nouns lost their genitive inflections. &quot;Lady&quot; would later gain an -s genitive ending, and therefore the name means &quot;(Our) Lady&#x27;s day&quot;. The day commemorates the tradition of archangel Gabriel&#x27;s announcement to Mary that she would give birth to the Christ.

It is celebrated on 25 March each year. In the Catholic Church&#x27;s Latin liturgical rites, when 25 March falls during Holy Week or Easter week, it is transferred forward to the first suitable day during Eastertide. In Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism, it is never transferred, even if it falls on Pascha (Easter). The concurrence of these two feasts is called kyriopascha.

The Feast of the Annunciation is observed almost universally throughout Christianity, especially within Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Catholicism, and Lutheranism. It is a major Marian feast, classified as a solemnity in the Catholic Church, a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, and a Principal Feast in the Anglican Communion. In Orthodox Christianity, because it announces the incarnation of Christ, it is counted as one of the 8 great feasts of the Lord, and not among the four great Marian feasts, although some prominent aspects of its liturgical observance are Marian. Two examples in liturgical Christianity of the importance attached to the Annunciation are the Angelus prayer and, especially in Roman Catholicism, the event&#x27;s position as the first Joyful Mystery of the Dominican Rosary.

==Secular significance==

In England, Lady Day was New Year&#x27;s Day (i.e., the new year began on 25 March) from 1155 until 1752, when the Gregorian calendar was adopted in Great Britain and its Empire and with it the first of January as the official start of the year in England, Wales and Ireland. (Scotland changed its new year&#x27;s day to 1 January in 1600, but retained the Julian calendar until 1752.) A vestige of this remains in the United Kingdom&#x27;s tax year, which ends on 5 April, or &quot;Old Lady Day&quot;, (i.e., Lady Day adjusted for the eleven &quot;lost days&quot; of the calendar change in 1752). Until this change Lady Day had been used as the start of the legal year but also the end of the fiscal and tax year. This should be distinguished from the liturgical and historical year.

As a year-end and quarter-day that conveniently did not fall within or between the seasons for ploughing and harvesting, Lady Day was a traditional day on which year-long contracts between landowners and tenant farmers would begin and end in England and nearby lands (although there were regional variations). Farmers&#x27; time of &quot;entry&quot; into new farms and onto new fields was often this day. As a result, farming families who were changing farms would travel from the old farm to the new one on Lady Day. In 1752, the British empire finally followed most of western Europe in switching to the Gregorian calendar from the Julian calendar. The Julian lagged 11 days behind the Gregorian, and hence 25 March in the Old Style calendar became 5 April (&quot;Old Lady Day&quot;), which assumed the role of contractual year-beginning. (The date is significant in some of the works of Thomas Hardy, such as &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; and &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;, and is discussed in his 1884 essay &quot;The Dorset Farm Labourer&quot;).

<text>Cinchona (pronounced or ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae containing at least 23 species of trees and shrubs. All are native to the tropical Andean forests of western South America. A few species are reportedly naturalized in Central America, Jamaica, French Polynesia, Sulawesi, Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, and São Tomé and Príncipe off the coast of tropical Africa, and others have been cultivated in India and Java, where they have formed hybrids.

&quot;Cinchona&quot; has been historically sought after for its medicinal value, as the bark of several species yields quinine and other alkaloids. These were the only effective treatments against malaria during the height of European colonialism, which made them of great economic and political importance. Trees in the genus are also known as fever trees because of their antimalarial properties.

The artificial synthesis of quinine in 1944, an increase in resistant forms of malaria, and the emergence of alternate therapies eventually ended large-scale economic interest in &quot;Cinchona&quot; cultivation. &quot;Cinchona&quot; alkaloids show promise in treating &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; malaria, which has evolved resistance to synthetic drugs. Cinchona plants continue to be revered for their historical legacy; the national tree of Peru is in the genus &quot;Cinchona&quot;.

==Etymology and common names==
Carl Linnaeus named the genus in 1742, based on a claim that the plant had cured the wife of the Count of Chinchón, a Spanish viceroy in Lima, in the 1630s, though the veracity of this story has been disputed. Linnaeus used the Italian spelling &quot;Cinchona&quot;, but the name Chinchón (pronounced in Spanish) led to Clements Markham and others proposing a correction of the spelling to &quot;Chinchona&quot;, and some prefer the pronunciation for the common name of the plant. Traditional medicine uses from South America known as Jesuit&#x27;s bark and Jesuit&#x27;s powder have been traced to &quot;Cinchona&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Cinchona&quot; plants belong to the family Rubiaceae and are large shrubs or small trees with evergreen foliage, growing in height. The leaves are opposite, rounded to lanceolate, and 10–40 cm long. The flowers are white, pink, or red, and produced in terminal panicles. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous seeds. A key character of the genus is that the flowers have marginally hairy corolla lobes. Some species display heterostyly. The tribe Cinchoneae includes the genera &quot;Cinchonopsis&quot;, &quot;Jossia&quot;, &quot;Ladenbergia&quot;, &quot;Remijia&quot;, &quot;Stilpnophyllum&quot;, and &quot;Ciliosemina&quot;. In South America, natural populations of &quot;Cinchona&quot; species have geographically distinct distributions. During the 19th century, the introduction of several species into cultivation in the same areas of India and Java, by the English and Dutch East India Company, respectively, led to the formation of hybrids.

Linnaeus described the genus based on the species &quot;Cinchona officinalis&quot;, which is found only in a small region of Ecuador and is of little medicinal significance. Nearly 300 species were later described and named in the genus, but a revision of the genus in 1998 identified only 23 distinct species.

==History==
===Early references===
The febrifugal properties of bark from trees now known to be in the genus &quot;Cinchona&quot; were used by many South American cultures prior to European contact. Jesuits played a key role in the transfer of remedies from the New World.

The traditional story connecting &quot;Cinchona&quot; species with malaria treatment was first recorded by Italian physician Sebastiano Bado in 1663. It tells of the wife of Luis Jerónimo de Cabrera, 4th Count of Chinchón and Viceroy of Peru, who fell ill in Lima with a tertian fever. A Spanish governor advised a traditional remedy, which resulted in a miraculous and rapid cure. The countess then supposedly ordered a large quantity of the bark and took it back to Europe. Bado claimed to have received this information from an Italian named Antonius Bollus, who was a merchant in Peru. Clements Markham identified the countess as Ana de Osorio, but this was shown to be incorrect by Haggis. Ana de Osorio married the Count of Chinchón in August 1621 and died in 1625, several years before the count was appointed viceroy of Peru in 1628. His second wife, Francisca Henriques de Ribera, accompanied him to Peru. Haggis further examined the count&#x27;s diaries and found no mention of the countess suffering from fever, although the count himself had many malarial attacks. Because of these and numerous other discrepancies, Bado&#x27;s story has been generally rejected as little more than a legend.

Quina bark was mentioned by Fray Antonio de La Calancha in 1638 as coming from a tree in Loja (Loxa). He noted that bark powder weighing about two coins was cast into water and drunk to cure fevers and &quot;tertians&quot;. Jesuit Father Bernabé Cobo (1582–1657) also wrote on the &quot;fever tree&quot; in 1653. The legend was popularized in English literature by Markham, and in 1874, he also published a &quot;plea for the correct spelling of the genus &quot;Chinchona&quot;&quot;. Spanish physician and botanist Nicolás Monardes wrote of a New World bark powder used in Spain in 1574, and another physician, Juan Fragoso, wrote of bark powder from an unknown tree in 1600 that was used for treating various ills. Both identify the sources as trees that do not bear fruit and have heart-shaped leaves; they were suggested to have been referring to &quot;Cinchona&quot; species.

The name &quot;quina-quina&quot; or &quot;quinquina&quot; was suggested as an old name for &quot;Cinchona&quot; used in Europe and based on the native name used by the Quechua people which means &#x27;bark of barks&#x27;. Italian sources spelt &quot;quina&quot; as &quot;cina&quot;, which was a source of confusion with &quot;Smilax&quot; from China. Haggis argued that &quot;qina&quot; and Jesuit&#x27;s bark actually referred to &quot;Myroxylon peruiferum&quot;, or Peruvian balsam, and that this was an item of importance in Spanish trade in the 1500s. Over time, the bark of &quot;Myroxylon&quot; may have been adulterated with the similar-looking bark of what is now known as &quot;Cinchona&quot;. Gradually, the adulterant became the main product that was the key therapeutic ingredient used in malarial therapy. The bark was included as &quot;Cortex Peruanus&quot; in the London Pharmacopoeia in 1677.

===Economic significance===

The &quot;fever tree&quot; was finally described carefully by astronomer Charles Marie de la Condamine, who visited Quito in 1735 on a quest to measure an arc of the meridian. The species he described, &quot;Cinchona officinalis&quot;, however, was found to be of little therapeutic value. The first living plants seen in Europe were &quot;C. calisaya&quot; plants grown at the &quot;Jardin des Plantes&quot; from seeds collected by Hugh Algernon Weddell from Bolivia in 1846. José Celestino Mutis, physician to the Viceroy of Nueva Granada, Pedro Messia de la Cerda, gathered information on cinchona in Colombia from 1760 and wrote a manuscript, &quot;El Arcano de la Quina&quot; (1793), with illustrations. He proposed a Spanish expedition to search for plants of commercial value, which was approved in 1783 and was continued after his death in 1808 by his nephew Sinforoso Mutis. As demand for the bark increased, the trees in the forests began to be destroyed. To maintain their monopoly on cinchona bark, Peru and surrounding countries began outlawing the export of cinchona seeds and saplings beginning in the early 19th century.

The colonial European powers eventually considered growing the plant in other parts of the tropics. The French mission of 1743, of which de la Condamine was a member, lost their cinchona plants when a wave took them off their ship. The Dutch sent Justus Hasskarl, who brought plants that were then cultivated in Java from 1854. English explorer Clements Markham went to collect plants that were introduced in Sri Lanka and the Nilgiris of southern India in 1860. The main species introduced were &quot;C. succirubra&quot;, or red bark, (now &quot;C. pubescens&quot;) as its sap turned red on contact with air, and &quot;Cinchona calisaya&quot;. The alkaloids quinine and cinchonine were extracted by Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou in 1820. Two more key alkaloids, quinidine and cinchonidine, were later identified and it became a routine in quinology to examine the contents of these components in assays. The yields of quinine in the cultivated trees were low and time was needed to develop sustainable methods to extract bark.

In the meantime, Charles Ledger and his native assistant Manuel Incra Mamani collected another species from Bolivia. Mamani was caught and beaten by Bolivian officials, leading to his death, but Ledger obtained seeds containing high levels of quinine. These seeds were offered to the British, who were uninterested, leading to the rest being sold to the Dutch. The Dutch saw their value and multiplied the stock. The species later named &quot;Cinchona ledgeriana&quot; yielded 8 to 13% quinine in bark grown in Dutch Indonesia, which effectively outcompeted the British Indian production which focused on a range of alkaloids other than quinine. Only later did the English see the value and sought to obtain the seeds of &quot;C. ledgeriana&quot; from the Dutch.

Francesco Torti used the response of fevers to treatment with &quot;Cinchona&quot; as a system of classification of fevers or a means for diagnosis between malarial and non-malarial fevers. Its use in the effective treatment of malaria brought an end to treatment by bloodletting and long-held ideas of humorism from Galen. Clements Markham was knighted for his role in establishing &quot;Cinchona&quot; species in Indonesia. Hasskarl was knighted with the Dutch order of the Lion.

==Ecology==
&quot;Cinchona&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidopteran species, including the engrailed, the commander, and members of the genus &quot;Endoclita&quot;, including &quot;E. damor&quot;, &quot;E. purpurescens&quot;, and &quot;E. sericeus&quot;.

&quot;C.pubescens&quot; has grown uncontrolled on some islands, such as the Galapagos, where it has posed the risk of outcompeting native plant species.

==Cultivation and use==

Whether cinchona bark was used in any traditional medicines within Andean Indigenous groups when it first came to notice by Europeans is unclear. Since its first confirmed medicinal record in the early 17th century, it has been used as a treatment for malaria. This use was popularised in Europe by the Spanish colonisers of South America. The bark contains alkaloids, including quinine and quinidine. Cinchona is the only economically practical source of quinine, a drug that is still recommended for the treatment of &quot;falciparum&quot; malaria.

=== Europe ===
Italian botanist Pietro Castelli wrote a pamphlet noteworthy as being the first Italian publication to mention the &quot;Cinchona&quot; species. By the 1630s (or 1640s, depending on the reference), the bark was being exported to Europe. In the late 1640s, the method of use of the bark was noted in the &quot;Schedula Romana.&quot; The Royal Society of London published in its first year (1666) &quot;An account of Dr. Sydenham&#x27;s book, entitled, Methodus curandi febres . . .&quot;

English King Charles II called upon Robert Talbor, who had become famous for his miraculous malaria cure. Because at that time the bark was in religious controversy, Talbor gave the king the bitter bark decoction in great secrecy. The treatment gave the king complete relief from the malaria fever. In return, Talbor was offered membership of the prestigious Royal College of Physicians.

In 1679, Talbor was called by the King of France, Louis XIV, whose son was suffering from malarial fever. After a successful treatment, Talbor was rewarded by the king with 3,000 gold crowns and a lifetime pension for this prescription. Talbor was asked to keep the entire episode secret. After Talbor&#x27;s death, the French king published this formula: seven grams of rose leaves, two ounces of lemon juice and a strong decoction of the cinchona bark served with wine. Wine was used because some alkaloids of the cinchona bark are not soluble in water, but are soluble in the ethanol in wine. In 1681 &quot;Água de Inglaterra&quot; was introduced into Portugal from England by Dr. Fernando Mendes who, similarly, &quot;received a handsome gift from (King Pedro) on condition that he should reveal to him the secret of its composition and withhold it from the public&quot;.

In 1738, &quot;Sur l&#x27;arbre du quinquina&quot;, a paper written by Charles Marie de La Condamine, lead member of the expedition, along with Pierre Godin and Louis Bouger that was sent to Ecuador to determine the length of a degree of the 1/4 of meridian arc in the neighbourhood of the equator, was published by the French Academy of Sciences. In it he identified three separate species.

=== Homeopathy ===
The birth of homeopathy was based on cinchona bark testing. The founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann, when translating William Cullen&#x27;s &quot;Materia medica&quot;, noticed Cullen had written that Peruvian bark was known to cure intermittent fevers. Hahnemann took daily a large, rather than homeopathic, dose of Peruvian bark. After two weeks, he said he felt malaria-like symptoms. This idea of &quot;like cures like&quot; was the starting point of his writings on homeopathy. Hahnemann&#x27;s symptoms have been suggested by researchers, both homeopaths and skeptics, as being an indicator of his hypersensitivity to quinine.

===Widespread cultivation===
The bark was very valuable to Europeans in expanding their access to and exploitation of resources in distant colonies and at home. Bark gathering was often environmentally destructive, destroying huge expanses of trees for their bark, with difficult conditions for low wages that did not allow the indigenous bark gatherers to settle debts even upon death.

Further exploration of the Amazon Basin and the economy of trade in various species of the bark in the 18th century is captured by Lardner Gibbon:

... this bark was first gathered in quantities in 1849, though known for many years. The best quality is not quite equal to that of Yungas, but only second to it. There are four other classes of inferior bark, for some of which the bank pays fifteen dollars per quintal. The best, by law, is worth fifty-four dollars. The freight to Arica is seventeen dollars the mule load of three quintals. Six thousand quintals of bark have already been gathered from Yuracares. The bank was established in the year 1851. mentioned the existence of cinchona bark on his visit to Yuracares in 1796
:— &quot;Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon&quot;, by Lieut. Lardner Gibbon, USN. Vol. II, Ch. 6, pp. 146–47.

It was estimated that the British Empire incurred direct losses of 52 to 62 million pounds a year due to malaria sickness each year. It was therefore of great importance to secure the supply of the cure. In 1860, a British expedition to South America led by Clements Markham smuggled back cinchona seeds and plants, which were introduced in several areas of British India and Sri Lanka. In India, it was planted in Ootacamund by William Graham McIvor. In Sri Lanka, it was planted in the Hakgala Botanical Garden in January 1861. James Taylor, the pioneer of tea planting in Sri Lanka, was one of the pioneers of cinchona cultivation. By 1883, about were in cultivation in Sri Lanka, with exports reaching a peak of 15 million pounds in 1886. The cultivation (initially of &quot;C. succirubra&quot; (now &quot;C. pubescens&quot;) and later of &quot;C. calisaya&quot;) was extended through the work of George King and others into the hilly terrain of Darjeeling District of Bengal. Cinchona factories were established at Naduvattam in the Nilgiris and at Mungpoo, Darjeeling, West Bengal. Quinologists were appointed to oversee the extraction of alkaloids with John Broughton in the Nilgiris and C.H. Wood at Darjeeling. Others in the position included David Hooper and John Eliot Howard.
In 1865, &quot;New Virginia&quot; and &quot;Carlota Colony&quot; were established in Mexico by Matthew Fontaine Maury, a former Confederate in the American Civil War. Postwar Confederates were enticed there by Maury, now the &quot;Imperial Commissioner of Immigration&quot; for Emperor Maximillian of Mexico, and Archduke of Habsburg. All that survives of those two colonies are the flourishing groves of &quot;cinchonas&quot; established by Maury using seeds purchased from England. These seeds were the first to be introduced into Mexico.

The cultivation of cinchona led from the 1890s to a decline in the price of quinine, but the quality and production of raw bark by the Dutch in Indonesia led them to dominate world markets. The producers of processed drugs in Europe (especially Germany), however, bargained and caused fluctuations in prices, which led to a Dutch-led Cinchona Agreement in 1913 that ensured a fixed price for producers. A &quot;Kina Bureau&quot; in Amsterdam regulated this trade.

During World War II, the Japanese conquered Java and the United States lost access to the cinchona plantations that supplied war-critical quinine medication. Botanical expeditions called Cinchona Missions were launched between 1942 and 1944 to explore promising areas of South America in an effort to locate cinchona species that contained quinine and could be harvested for quinine production. As well as being ultimately successful in their primary aim, these expeditions also identified new species of plants and created a new chapter in international relations between the United States and other nations in the Americas.

==Chemistry==
===Cinchona alkaloids===

The bark of trees in this genus is the source of a variety of alkaloids, the most familiar of which is quinine, an antipyretic (antifever) agent especially useful in treating malaria. For a while the extraction of a mixture of alkaloids from the cinchona bark, known in India as the cinchona febrifuge, was used. The alkaloid mixture or its sulphated form mixed in alcohol and sold as quinetum was however very bitter and caused nausea, among other side effects.

Cinchona alkaloids include:
* cinchonine and cinchonidine (stereoisomers with R1 = vinyl, R2 = hydrogen)
* quinine and quinidine (stereoisomers with R1 = vinyl, R2 = methoxy)
* dihydroquinine and dihydroquinidine (stereoisomers with R1 = ethyl, R2 = methoxy)

They find use in organic chemistry as organocatalysts in asymmetric synthesis.

===Other chemicals===
Alongside the alkaloids, many cinchona barks contain cinchotannic acid, a particular tannin, which by oxidation rapidly yields a dark-coloured phlobaphene called red cinchonic, cinchono-fulvic acid, or cinchona red.

In 1934, efforts to make malaria drugs cheap and effective for use across countries led to the development of a standard called &quot;totaquina&quot; proposed by the Malaria Commission of the League of Nations. Totaquina required a minimum of 70% crystallizable alkaloids, of which at least 15% was to be quinine with not more than 20% amorphous alkaloids.

==Species==
There are at least 24 species of &quot;Cinchona&quot; recognized by botanists. There are likely several unnamed species and many intermediate forms that have arisen due to the plants&#x27; tendency to hybridize.

<text>Michaelmas ( ; also known as the Feast of Saints Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, the Feast of the Archangels, or the Feast of Saint Michael and All Angels) is a Christian festival observed in many Western Christian liturgical calendars on 29 September, and on 8 November in the Eastern Christian traditions. Michaelmas has been one of the four quarter days of the English and Irish financial, judicial, and academic year.

In the Christian angelology of some traditions, the Archangel Michael is considered as the greatest of all the angels; being particularly honored for defeating the devil in the war in heaven.

==History==

The name Michaelmas comes from a shortening of &quot;Michael&#x27;s Mass&quot;, in the same style as Christmas (Christ&#x27;s Mass) and Candlemas (Candle Mass, the Mass where traditionally the candles to be used throughout the year would be blessed).

During the Middle Ages, Michaelmas was celebrated as a Holy Day of Obligation, but this tradition was abolished in the 18th century. In medieval England, Michaelmas marked the ending and beginning of the husbandman&#x27;s year, George C. Homans observes: &quot;at that time harvest was over, and the bailiff or reeve of the manor would be making out the accounts for the year.&quot;

Because it falls near the equinox, this holy day is associated in the northern hemisphere with the beginning of autumn and the shortening of days. It was also one of the English, Welsh, and Irish quarter days, when accounts had to be settled. On manors, it was the day when a reeve was elected from the peasants. Michaelmas hiring fairs were held at the end of September or beginning of October. The day was also considered a &quot;gale day&quot; in Ireland when rent would be due, as well as a day for the issuing or settling of contracts or other legal transactions.
==Celebration==
On the Isle of Skye, Scotland, a procession was held. One of the few flowers left around at this time of year is the Michaelmas daisy (also known as asters). Hence the rhyme: &quot;The Michaelmas daisies, among dead weeds, Bloom for St Michael&#x27;s valorous deeds ...&quot;

In Ireland, (), pilgrimages to holy wells associated with St Michael took place, with pilgrims taking a drink from the holy water from the well. The greeting &quot;May Michaelmas féinín on you&quot; was traditional. Boys born on this day were often christened Michael or Micheál. In Tramore, County Waterford, a procession with an effigy of St Michael, called the Micilín, was brought through the town to the shore to mark the end of the fishing season. In Irish folklore, clear weather on Michaelmas was a portent of a long winter, &quot;Michaelmas Day be bright and clear there will be two &#x27;Winters&#x27; in the year.&quot;

===Food===
A traditional meal for the day includes goose known as a &quot;stubble-goose&quot; (one prepared around harvest time, fattened on the ) also known as an &quot;embling&quot; or &quot;rucklety&quot; goose. There was a saying that &quot;if you eat goose on Michaelmas Day you will never lack money all year&quot;. Tenant farmers sometimes presented the geese to their landlords, as could be stipulated in their tenancy agreements. The custom dates to at least the 15th century, and was easily continued as geese are in their prime at Michaelmas time. 

One association of geese with Michaelmas comes from a legend in which the son of an Irish king choked on a goose bone he had eaten, and was then brought back to life by St. Patrick. The king ordered the sacrifice of a goose every Michaelmas in honour of the saint. The Irish Michaelmas goose was slaughtered and eaten on the day; they were also presented as gifts or donated to the poor.
In parts of Ireland sheep were also slaughtered with tradition of the &quot;St. Michael&#x27;s portion&quot; donated to the poor. Poultry markets and fairs took place to sell geese as well as mutton pies. In Ulster, it was traditional for tenants to present their landlord with a couple of geese, a tradition dating back to Edward IV. There were differing methods across Ireland for cooking the goose, most generally using a heavy iron pot on an open hearth. In Blacklion, County Cavan, the goose was covered in local blue clay and placed at the centre of the fire until the clay broke, indicating the goose was cooked.

Another legend surrounding the origin of the Michaelmas goose is that Queen Elizabeth I was eating a goose on the holiday when she heard of the defeat of the Spanish Armada, and thus proclaimed that geese should be eaten by everyone each year in commemoration of the victory. This falls apart when the date (geese and Michaelmas were connected at least a century earlier, if not longer) and the timing of the battle (August) are considered.

The custom of baking a special bread or cake, called (), &quot;St. Michael&#x27;s bannock&quot;, or &quot;Michaelmas bannock&quot;, on the eve of the Feast of Saint Michael, the Archangel, probably originated in the Hebrides. The bread was made from equal parts of barley, oats, and rye without using any metal implements.
In remembrance of absent friends or those who had died, special &quot;Struans&quot;, blessed at an early morning Mass, were given to the poor in their names.

Nuts were traditionally cracked on Michaelmas Eve.

Folklore in the British Isles suggests that Michaelmas day is the last day that blackberries can be picked. It is said that when St. Michael expelled the devil, Lucifer, from heaven, he fell from the skies and landed in a prickly blackberry bush. Satan cursed the fruit, scorched them with his fiery breath, stamped, spat, and urinated on them, so that they would be unfit for eating. As it is considered ill-advised to eat them after 11 October (Old Michaelmas Day according to the Julian Calendar), a Michaelmas pie is made from the last of the season. In Ireland, the soiling of blackberries is also attributed to a púca.

==Differences in number of archangels==
In the Roman Catholic Church on 29 September three Archangels are celebrated: Saint Michael, Saint Gabriel, and Saint Raphael. Their feasts were unified in one common day during the second half of the 20th century. In the time before their feasts were: 29 September (only St Michael), 24 March for St Gabriel, and 24 October for St Raphael.

In the Lutheran, as well as in the Anglican/Episcopalian traditions, there are three to four archangels in their calendars for the 29 September feast for St. Michael and All Angels: namely Michael (Jude 1:9) and Gabriel (Daniel 9:21), Raphael (Tobit 12:15) and sometimes Uriel (2 Esdras 4:1 and 2 Esdras 5:20).

==Autumn term in universities==

Michaelmas is used in the extended sense of autumn, as the name of the first term of the academic year, which begins at this time, at various educational institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland and those parts of the Commonwealth in the northern hemisphere. These include the universities of Cambridge, London, Durham, Lancaster, Oxford, Swansea, and Dublin. However, the ancient Scottish universities used the name Martinmas for their autumn term, following the old Scottish term days.

==Use by legal profession==
The Inns of Court of the English Bar and the Honorable Society of King&#x27;s Inns in Ireland also have a Michaelmas term as one of their dining terms. It begins in September and ends towards the end of December.

The term is also the name of the first of four terms into which the legal year is divided by the courts of Ireland and England and Wales.

In the United Kingdom, the United States and Ireland, a Red Mass is traditionally convened on the Sunday closest to Michaelmas, in honor of and to bless lawyers and judges.

While terms are not used by most courts in the United States, where court calendars are usually continuous and year-round, the U.S. Supreme Court operates on an annual term and roughly follows the English custom by beginning that term on the first Monday in October, a few days after Michaelmas.

==Modern observances==

Because Saint Michael is the patron of police officers, Michaelmas may also see a Blue Mass. Lutheran Christians consider it a principal feast of Christ.

Michaelmas is still celebrated in Waldorf schools. Rudolf Steiner considered it the second most important festival after Easter. The celebration of this holiday teaches the importance of facing fears and strengthening resolve. As the first festival of the new school year, it is celebrated with an all-school play, in which each class assumes a role, such as peasants, townspeople, nobles, etc. Students assume a new role as they pass from grade to grade, and it becomes something of a rite of passage.

In the City of London, Michaelmas is the day when the new Lord Mayor of London is elected, in the &quot;Common Hall&quot;.

In Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, Michaelmas has been observed since 1786 as Goose Day. Local tradition holds that eating goose on 29 September will bring prosperity. The Juniata River Valley began celebrating this version of Michaelmas when a Pennsylvania Dutchman named Andrew Pontius moved his family to neighboring Snyder County to farm. When his farm prospered, he decided to hire a tenant farmer to help. On his way to Lancaster to hire a German immigrant, he stopped in Harrisburg for the night where he met a young Englishman named Archibald Hunter, who was offered the job. The contract that was drawn for employment contained a clause specifying their accounts were to be settled each year on the traditional day to do so, 29 September. When that day came, Hunter appeared at Pontius&#x27; door with his accounts and a goose, explaining that in England, eating a goose on 29 September brought good luck. The tradition spread to nearby Lewistown, Pennsylvania, where it is still honored today with many local restaurants and civics groups offering goose dinners, local festivals, and other county-wide activities. In honor of the holiday, painted fiberglass goose statues can be found throughout the county all year long.

==Old Michaelmas Day==
Old Michaelmas Day falls on 11 October (10 October according to some sources – the dates are the result of the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar so the gap widens by a day every century except the current one). It is said that the Devil fell out of Heaven on this date, and fell into a blackberry bush, cursing the fruit as he fell. According to an old legend, blackberries should not be picked after this date (see above). In Yorkshire, it is said that the devil spat on them. According to Morrell (1977), this old legend is well known in all parts of Great Britain, even as far north as the Orkney Islands. In Cornwall, a similar legend prevails; however, the saying goes that the devil urinated on them.

<text>Mexico City International Airport (); officially &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional Benito Juárez&quot; (Benito Juárez International Airport) is the primary international airport serving Greater Mexico City. It is the busiest airport in Mexico and Latin America, ranking as the 17th-busiest in the world and eighth in North America as of 2022, based on passenger traffic and aircraft movements.

The airport is served by more than 25 airlines, handling flights to over 100 destinations across Mexico, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. With an average of 124,000 daily passengers, the airport handled 48,415,693 passengers in 2023 and 45,359,485 in 2024.

As the primary hub for Mexico&#x27;s flag carrier, Aeroméxico, Mexico City Airport functions as a SkyTeam hub. Additionally, it serves as a hub for Volaris and Viva, and a focus city for Magnicharters. The facility comprises two passenger terminals and two runways. It supports cargo activities and accommodates entities such as Mexican Airspace Navigation Services, the Mexican Federal Civil Aviation Agency, and an Air Force Base. It is owned by the Mexican Navy and operated by &quot;Grupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de Mexico&quot;. It was named after the 19th-century president Benito Juárez.

Part of Mexico City&#x27;s airport system, which also includes Toluca International Airport and Felipe Ángeles International Airport, the Mexico City International Airport was operating at full capacity, as of mid-2020. With an average of 1,056 daily aircraft movements, it ranks as one of the busiest two-runway airports in the world.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The original site, known as Llanos de Balbuena, had been utilized for aeronautical activities since 1910, marking a significant milestone when Alberto Braniff became the first person to fly an airplane in Mexico and Latin America. This historic flight took place on board a Voisin biplane. On November 30, 1911, President Francisco I. Madero achieved another aviation first by being the world&#x27;s inaugural head of state to fly on an airplane, piloted by Geo M. Dyott of Moisant International.

In 1915, the site opened as Balbuena Military Airport, equipped with five runways. The construction of a small civilian airport commenced in 1928. The first landing occurred on November 5, 1928, regular services began in 1929, and the official inauguration took place on May 15, 1931. On July 8, 1943, it gained international status, launching its initial international route to Los Angeles International Airport operated by Mexicana de Aviación.

From 1949 to 1951, the airport underwent an expansion that involved the construction of a new runway, designated as 05R-23L, an apron, a control tower, and administration offices. President Miguel Alemán inaugurated a renovated passenger terminal on November 19, 1952. By 1956, the airport operated with four runways: 05L-23R (), 05R-23L (), featuring electric lights for night-time service; 13-31 (), constructed to relieve the runway 14-32, which was too close to adjacent residential areas; and Runway 5 Auxiliary ().

On December 2, 1963, the airport&#x27;s name changed from &quot;&quot;Aeropuerto Central&quot; (Central Airport) to &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de México&quot;&quot; (Mexico City International Airport). In the 1970s, the two shortest runways (13/31 and 5 Auxiliary) were closed to facilitate the construction of a social housing complex in that area, named Unidad Fiviport. This initiative resulted in the airport&#x27;s current configuration with two parallel runways. On November 24, 1978, the Mexico City Area Control Center (ACC) commenced its operations and has been in continuous service since then.

=== Expansion and decentralization ===
The airport, constrained by its location in a densely populated area, faced limitations in infrastructure expansion due to urban constraints, limited runway space, and congestion during peak hours. The proximity of the two parallel runways restricts fully simultaneous operations, contributing significantly to the constraint. The terminal underwent expansion on multiple occasions: in 1980, doubling its capacity with a single large terminal layout, and in 1990, separating domestic and international facilities for increased functionality. Renovations continued, and on April 11, 1994, a new International section became operational through a joint venture between Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA) and Hakim Grupo Industrial, led by Alfredo Hakim Aburto at the time. 

Mexicana, a key player in the country&#x27;s aviation industry, initiated a decentralization effort to alleviate congestion at the airport. This effort involved relocating numerous flights to airports in Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Mérida. In 1994, all general aviation operations were moved to Toluca International Airport. Since then, only government, military, commercial, and specially authorized aircraft are allowed at the airport. In 2001, the passenger terminal expanded with the construction of a satellite building east of the terminal featuring eight gates.

=== Congestion challenges ===

In 2002, President Vicente Fox&#x27;s administration introduced an ambitious plan for a new expansive airport covering in the municipalities of Atenco and Texcoco. However, the Atenco project faced substantial opposition and controversy, especially from the Community Front in Defense of Land (), representing locals facing displacement. Protests escalated into violent clashes, resulting in the cancellation of the new airport.

In response, the federal government in 2003 announced an extension to the existing terminal, expanding its service capacity from 20 million to 32 million passengers annually. The expansion covered , with as new construction and as renovated areas. Renovations included new check-in areas, commercial spaces, a new departures concourse, and the construction of a long-distance bus terminal. The bus station provided access to a food court, the international arrivals and departures area, and a pedestrian bridge connecting to &quot;The Peñón de los Baños&quot; neighborhood.

Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, political initiatives aimed at establishing nearby airports such as Puebla, Toluca, Cuernavaca, and Querétaro as supplementary options for serving the Mexico City Area were introduced. This initiative, known as the Metropolitan Airport System, was promoted by the Federal Administration.

On November 15, 2007, Terminal 2 was inaugurated, significantly increasing the airport&#x27;s capacity. All SkyTeam members, except Air France and KLM, relocated their operations to the new terminal. Officially opened in March 2008, Terminal 2 expanded the gates number by 40% and operational capacity by 15%. The inauguration ceremony was led by President Felipe Calderón.

=== Replacement controversy ===
In 2014, Mexican authorities declared the airspace around Mexico City Airport saturated, setting a maximum capacity of 61 operations per hour from 7:00 to 23:59. President Peña Nieto&#x27;s administration reignited major airport infrastructure plans in the same year, introducing the Texcoco Airport project. Positioned as Mexico&#x27;s most significant public infrastructure project in a century, it aimed to replace the ageing Mexico City International Airport by 2023, featuring a state-of-the-art terminal of and six runways. However, President López Obrador, then a candidate, campaigned against Texcoco Airport, leading to a divisive political discourse.Upon assuming the presidency, López Obrador´s administration initiated a controversial referendum to gauge public opinion on completing Texcoco Airport or proceeding with the Santa Lucía expansion. Despite facing criticism for lacking official validity and result interpretation challenges, López Obrador&#x27;s administration pursued the Santa Lucía expansion, resulting in Felipe Ángeles International Airport, officially opened in 2022. Positioned as the secondary airport of Mexico City, it has been slow to gain prominence.

On July 23, 2020, an extension of Terminal 2, named Pier L, was inaugurated, adding 7 gates to reduce the use of buses. However, in 2022, a declaration of airport saturation was issued from 5:00 to 23:59 for Terminal 1 and from 6:00 to 23:00 for Terminal 2, maintaining the 61 operations/hour limit. In 2023, the Mexican government attempted to decongest the airport by announcing the relocation of all cargo aircraft landing at Mexico City to Felipe Ángeles Airport to &quot;protect the safety of the operations.&quot;

== Facilities ==
The airport is located in the neighborhood of Peñón de los Baños within Venustiano Carranza, one of the sixteen boroughs of Mexico City, situated east of Downtown Mexico City. Surrounded by the built-up areas of Gustavo A. Madero borough to the north and Venustiano Carranza borough to the west, south, and east, the airport&#x27;s runways, running southwest–northeast, contribute to overflying problems and noise pollution over Mexico City during landings with a northeast wind.

Being a hot and high airport at an elevation above sea level, any aircraft departing or arriving suffers from degraded performance due to the thinner air at such a high elevation. The field itself spans , featuring two parallel runways, less than apart, hindering simultaneous operations. Runway 05L/23R is long, and runway 05R/23L is long. North of the airfield houses Terminal 1, cargo facilities, maintenance hangars, and administration buildings. On its northern edge, Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA), a government-owned corporation, has its headquarters. South of the airfield, there is Terminal 2, maintenance hangars, police and Mexican Airspace Navigation Services facilities, and a military complex.

Air Force Base No. 19 () (B.A.M. 19) is located on the airport grounds, adjacent to Terminal 2. It serves as the home for the High Command Special Air Transport Unit (UETAAM) managing a diverse fleet of aircraft that includes the Boeing 737, IAI 201, JetStar, King Air, SA 330J, and UH-60 Black Hawk. It also hosts the General Coordination of the Presidential Air Transport Unit. B.A.M. 19 features an apron and several hangars, one of which is called the Presidential Hangar, used for receiving state visits and presidential travels. In addition to these, it includes administrative buildings and various other facilities for accommodating Air Force personnel.

Mexico City Area Control Center (ACC) is one of four Area Control Centres in Mexico, with the others being the Mazatlán ACC, Monterrey ACC, and Mérida ACC. It operates under the Mexican Airspace Navigation Services, (). Mexico ACC provides air traffic control services to aircraft within the Mexico Flight Data Region (FDRG). This region includes the central portion of Mexico. It shares its boundaries with six other Area Control Centers. To the north, it is adjacent to the Monterrey ACC, while to the east, it borders the Merida ACC. To the west, it borders the Mazatlán ACC, and to the south, it borders the Mazatlán Oceanic (MMFO).

The airport features 95 hardstands for aircraft, with 63 connected via Jet bridges to the terminals (33 in Terminal 1 and 30 in Terminal 2) and 32 remote stands. With an average of 1,056 daily operations, it holds the highest number for any two-runway airport globally.

<text>Tonic water is a carbonated soft drink in which quinine is dissolved. Originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, modern tonic water typically has a significantly lower quinine content and is often more sweetened than the original medicinal form. It is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavor.

== History ==
As early as the 17th century the Spanish used quinine from the bark of &quot;Cinchona&quot; trees to treat malaria after being shown the remedy from the Indigenous peoples of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. 

In early 19th century India and other tropical posts of the British Empire, medicinal quinine was recommended to British officials and soldiers to prevent malaria, where it was mixed with soda and sugar to mask its bitter taste, creating tonic water.

The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858 when it was patented by the owner of Pitt &amp; Co., Erasmus Bond. The mixed drink gin and tonic also originated in British colonial India, when the British mixed their medicinal quinine tonic with gin and other ingredients to make the bitter medicine more palatable. Soldiers in India were already given a gin ration, so the sweet concoction was easy to make. In 1868, the first known record of a gin and tonic was in the &quot;Oriental Sporting Magazine&quot; and was described as a refreshing cocktail for spectators of horse racing, not as a medicine.

== Quinine content ==

Medicinal tonic water originally contained only carbonated water and a large amount of quinine. Most modern tonic waters contain comparatively less quinine, and are often enhanced by citrus flavors. As a result of the lower quinine content, tonic water is less bitter. It is also usually sweetened, often with the addition of high-fructose corn syrup or sugar. Some manufacturers also produce diet (or &quot;slimline&quot;) tonic water, which may contain artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame. Traditional-style tonic water with high amounts of quinine and carbonated water is less common, but may be preferred by those who desire the bitter flavor.

In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limits the quinine content in tonic water to 83 ppm (83 mg per liter), while the daily therapeutic dose of quinine is in the range of 500–1000 mg, and 10 mg/kg every eight hours for effective malaria prevention (2,100 mg daily for a adult). Until about 2010, quinine was often recommended as a relief for leg cramps, although medical research suggested some care was needed in monitoring doses. Because of quinine&#x27;s risks, the FDA cautions consumers against using &quot;off-label&quot; quinine drugs to treat leg cramps.

==Use==

Tonic water is often used as a drink mixer for cocktails, especially gin and tonic. Vodka tonic is also popular. Tonic water with lemon or lime juice added is often known as bitter lemon or bitter lime. It is popular for its signature bitter but sweet taste. Another use of tonic water is in coffee. The espresso and tonic was created in Helsingborg, Sweden, at Koppi Roasters after a staff party where they mixed tonic water, syrup, and an espresso. Since 2007, the drink has grown in popularity in Scandinavia, Europe, and the United States.

== Negative effects ==
Tonic water is known to cause fixed eruptions, which is a type of skin reaction to drugs, due to the quinine content. Various scientific journals have reported that repeated intake of tonic water can cause fixed eruptions with varying severity, with one reporting the onset of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The cases of fixed eruptions were seen after the patients drank tonic water, by itself or mixed with gin. Some symptoms of fixed eruptions include pigmented macules, high fever, erythematous plaques, and bullae.

== Fluorescence ==

The quinine in tonic water will fluoresce under ultraviolet light. In fact, quinine will visibly fluoresce in direct sunlight against a dark background. The quinine molecules release energy as light instead of heat, which is more common. The state is not stable, and the molecules will eventually return to a ground state and no longer glow.

<text>Whitsun (also Whitsunday or Whit Sunday) is the name used in Britain, and other countries among Anglicans and Methodists, for the Christian holy day of Pentecost. It falls on the seventh Sunday after Easter and commemorates the descent of the Spirit of Truth upon Christ&#x27;s disciples (as described in Acts 2). Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three holiday weeks for the medieval villein; on most manors he was free from service on the lord&#x27;s demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. Whit Monday, the day after Whitsun, remained a holiday in Britain until 1971 when, with effect from 1972, the ruling Conservative Government decided to permanently replace it, following a five-year trial period, with a Spring Bank Holiday on the last Monday in May. 
Whit had been the occasion for many varied forms of celebration, and was of significant cultural importance. It was a custom for children to receive a new set of clothes, even among the poorest families, a tradition which continued well into the 20th century.

In the North West of England, church and chapel parades called whit walks still take place at this time (sometimes on Whit Friday, the Friday after Whitsun). Typically, the parades include brass bands and choirs; girls attending are dressed in white. Traditionally, Whit fairs (sometimes called Whitsun ales) took place. Other customs, such as Morris dancing, were associated with Whitsun, although in most cases they have been transferred to the Spring bank holiday. Whaddon, Cambridgeshire, has its own Whitsun tradition of singing a unique song around the village before and on Whit Sunday itself.

==Etymology==
The name is a contraction of &quot;White Sunday&quot;, attested in &quot;the Holy Ghost, whom thou didst send on Whit-sunday&quot; in the Old English homilies, and parallel to the mention of in the early 13th-century &quot;Ancrene Riwle&quot;. Walter William Skeat noted that the Anglo-Saxon word also appears in Icelandic &quot;hvitasunnu-dagr&quot;, but that in English the feast was called &quot;Pentecoste&quot; until after the Norman Conquest, when &quot;white&quot; () began to be confused with &quot;wit&quot; or understanding. According to one interpretation, the name derives from the white garments worn by catechumens, those expecting to be baptised on that Sunday. Moreover, in England white vestments, rather than the more usual red, were traditional for the day and its octave. A different tradition is that of the young women of the parish all coming to church or chapel in new white dresses on that day. However, Augustinian canon John Mirk (c. 1382–1414), of Lilleshall Abbey, Shropshire, had another interpretation:
Goode men and woymen, as ȝe knowen wele all, þys day ys called Whitsonday, for bycause þat þe Holy Gost as þys day broȝt wyt and wysdome ynto all Cristes dyscyples.
Thus, he thought the root of the word was &quot;wit&quot; (formerly spelt &quot;wyt&quot; or &quot;wytte&quot;) and Pentecost was so-called to signify the outpouring of the wisdom of the Holy Ghost on Christ&#x27;s disciples.

The following day is Whit Monday, a name coined to supersede the form &quot;Monday in Whitsun-week&quot; used by John Wycliffe and others. The week following Whit Sunday is known as &quot;Whitsuntide&quot; or &quot;Whit week&quot;.

==History==

As the first holiday of the summer, Whitsun was one of the favourite times in the traditional calendar, and Whit Sunday, or the following week, was a time for celebration. This took the form of fêtes, fairs, pageants and parades, with Whitsun ales and Morris dancing in the south of England and Whit walks, Club Days and wakes in the north. A poster advertising the Whitsun festivities at Sunbury, Middlesex in 1778 listed the following attractions:

On Whit Monday, in the morning, will be a punting match...The first boat that comes in to receive a guinea...In the afternoon a gold-laced hat, worth 30s. to be cudgell&#x27;d for... On Whit Tuesday, in the morning, a fine Holland smock and ribbons, to be run for by girls and young women. And in the afternoon six pairs of buckskin gloves to be wrestled for.
In Manchester during the 17th century the nearby Kersal Moor Whit races were the great event of the year when large numbers of people turned the area into a giant fairground for several days. With the coming of industrialisation it became convenient to close down whole towns for a week in order to clean and maintain the machinery in the mills and factories. The week of closure, or wakes week, was often held at Whitsuntide. A report in John Harlan and T.T. Wilkinson&#x27;s &quot;Lancashire Folk lore&quot; (1882) reads:

It is customary for the cotton mills etc., to close for Whitsuntide week to give the hands a holiday; the men going to the races etc. and the women visiting Manchester on Whit-Saturday, thronging the markets, the Royal Exchange and the Infirmary Esplanade, and other public places: And gazing in at the shop windows, whence this day is usually called &#x27;Gaping Sunday&#x27;.
Whit Monday was officially recognised as a bank holiday in the UK in 1871, but lost this status in 1972 when the fixed Spring Bank Holiday was created.

<text>William Henry Fox Talbot (; 11 February 180017 September 1877) was an English scientist, inventor, and photography pioneer who invented the salted paper and calotype processes, precursors to photographic processes of the later 19th and 20th centuries. His work in the 1840s on photomechanical reproduction led to the creation of the photoglyphic engraving process, the precursor to photogravure. He was the holder of a controversial patent that affected the early development of commercial photography in Britain. He was also a noted photographer who contributed to the development of photography as an artistic medium. He published &quot;The Pencil of Nature&quot; (1844–1846), which was illustrated with original salted paper prints from his calotype negatives and made some important early photographs of Oxford, Paris, Reading, and York.

A polymath, Talbot was elected to the Royal Society in 1831 for his work on the integral calculus, and researched in optics, chemistry, electricity and other subjects such as etymology, the decipherment of cuneiform, and ancient history.

== Early life ==
Talbot was born in Melbury House in Dorset and was the only child of William Davenport Talbot, of Lacock Abbey, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, and his wife Lady Elisabeth Fox Strangways, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Ilchester. His governess was Agnes Porter who had also educated his mother. Talbot was educated at Rottingdean, Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was awarded the Porson Prize in Classics in 1820, and graduated as twelfth wrangler in 1821. From 1822 to 1872, he communicated papers to the Royal Society, many of them on mathematical subjects. At an early period, he began optical research, which later bore fruit in connection with photography. To the &quot;Edinburgh Philosophical Journal&quot; in 1826 he contributed a paper on &quot;Some Experiments on Coloured Flame&quot;; to the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Science&quot; in 1827 a paper on &quot;Monochromatic Light&quot;; and to the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; papers on chemical subjects, including one on &quot;Chemical Changes of Colour&quot;.

== Photographic inventions ==
Talbot invented a process for creating reasonably light-fast and permanent photographs that was the first made available to the public; however, his was neither the first such process invented nor the first one publicly announced.

Shortly after Louis Daguerre&#x27;s invention of the daguerreotype was announced in early January 1839, without details, Talbot asserted priority of invention based on experiments he had begun in early 1834. At a Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution on 25 January 1839, Talbot exhibited several paper photographs he had made in 1835. Within a fortnight, he communicated the general nature of his process to the Royal Society, followed by more complete details a few weeks later. Daguerre did not publicly reveal any useful details until mid-August, although by the spring it had become clear that his process and Talbot&#x27;s were very different.

Talbot&#x27;s early &quot;salted paper&quot; or &quot;photogenic drawing&quot; process, used writing paper bathed in a weak solution of ordinary table salt (sodium chloride), dried, then brushed on one side with a strong solution of silver nitrate, which created a tenacious coating of very light-sensitive silver chloride that darkened where it was exposed to light. Whether used to create shadow image photograms by placing objects on it and setting it out in the sunlight, or to capture the dim images formed by a lens in a camera, it was a &quot;printing out&quot; process, meaning that the exposure had to continue until the desired degree of darkening had been produced. In the case of camera images, that could require an exposure of an hour or two if something more than a silhouette of objects against a bright sky was wanted. Earlier experimenters such as Thomas Wedgwood and Nicéphore Niépce had captured shadows and camera images with silver salts years before, but they could find no way to prevent their photographs from fatally darkening all over when exposed to daylight. Talbot devised several ways of chemically stabilizing his results, making them sufficiently insensitive to further exposure that direct sunlight could be used to print the negative image produced in the camera onto another sheet of salted paper, creating a positive.

== The Calotype ==



The &quot;calotype&quot;, or &quot;talbotype&quot;, was a &quot;developing out&quot; process, Talbot&#x27;s improvement of his earlier photogenic drawing process by the use of a different silver salt (silver iodide instead of silver chloride) and a developing agent (gallic acid and silver nitrate) to bring out an invisibly slight &quot;latent&quot; image on the exposed paper. This reduced the required exposure time in the camera to only a minute or two for subjects in bright sunlight. The translucent calotype negative made it possible to produce as many positive prints as desired by simple contact printing, whereas the daguerreotype was an opaque direct positive that could be reproduced only by being copied with a camera. On the other hand, the calotype, despite waxing of the negative to make the image clearer, still was not pin-sharp like the metallic daguerreotype, because the paper fibres blurred the printed image. The simpler salted paper process was normally used when making prints from calotype negatives.

Talbot announced his calotype process in 1841, and in August he licensed Henry Collen, the miniature painter, as the first professional calotypist. The most celebrated practitioners of the process were Hill &amp; Adamson. Another notable calotypist was Levett Landon Boscawen Ibbetson.

In 1842, Talbot received the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society for his photographic discoveries.

In 1852, Talbot discovered that gelatine treated with potassium dichromate, a sensitiser introduced by Mungo Ponton in 1839, is made less soluble by exposure to light. This later provided the basis for the important carbon printing process and related technologies. Dichromated gelatine is still used for some laser holography.

Talbot&#x27;s later photographic work was concentrated on photomechanical reproduction methods. In addition to making the mass reproduction of photographic images more practical and much less expensive, rendering a photograph into ink on paper, known to be permanent on a scale of hundreds if not thousands of years, was clearly one sure way to avoid the problems with fading that had soon become apparent in early types of silver image paper prints. Talbot created the photoglyphic (or &quot;photoglyptic&quot;) engraving process, later perfected by others as the photogravure process.
== Patenting controversy ==
Daguerre&#x27;s work on his process had commenced at about the same time as Talbot&#x27;s earliest work on his salted paper process. In 1839, Daguerre&#x27;s agent applied for English and Scottish patents only a matter of days before France, having granted Daguerre a pension for it, declared his invention &quot;free to the world.&quot; The United Kingdom, along with the British Empire, therefore became the only places where a licence was legally required to make and sell daguerreotypes. This exception is now usually regarded as both an expression of old national animosities, still smouldering just 24 years after Waterloo, and a reaction to Talbot&#x27;s patent. Talbot never attempted to patent any part of his printed-out silver chloride &quot;photogenic drawing&quot; process and his calotype patent was not registered in Scotland.

In February 1841, Talbot obtained an English patent for his developed-out calotype process. At first, he sold individual patent licences for £20 each; later, he lowered the fee for amateur use to £4. Professional photographers, however, had to pay up to £300 annually. In a business climate where many patent holders were attacked for enforcing their rights, and an academic world that viewed the patenting of new discoveries as a hindrance to scientific freedom and further progress, Talbot&#x27;s behaviour was widely criticised. On the other hand, many scientists supported his patent and they gave expert evidence in later trials. In addition, the calotype method was free for scientific uses, an area that Talbot himself pioneered, such as photomicrography. One reason Talbot later gave for vigorously enforcing his rights was that he had spent, according to his own reckoning, about £5,000 on his various photographic endeavours over the years and wanted to at least recoup his expenses.
In 1844, Talbot helped set up an establishment in Russell Terrace (now Baker Street), Reading, for mass-producing salted paper prints from his calotype negatives. The Reading Establishment, as it was known, also offered services to the public, making prints from others&#x27; negatives, copying artwork and documents, and taking portraits at its studio. The enterprise was not a success.

In 1851, the year of Daguerre&#x27;s death, Frederick Scott Archer publicised the wet collodion process, which made it practical to use glass instead of paper as the support for making the camera negative. The lack of detail often criticised in prints made from calotype negatives was overcome, and sharp images, comparable in detail to daguerreotypes, could finally be provided by convenient paper prints. The collodion process soon replaced the calotype in commercial use, and by the end of the decade, the daguerreotype was virtually extinct as well.

Asserting a very broad interpretation of his patent rights, Talbot declared that anyone using the collodion process would still need to get a calotype licence.

In August 1852, &quot;The Times&quot; published an open letter by Lord Rosse, the president of the Royal Society, and Charles Lock Eastlake, the president of the Royal Academy, who called on Talbot to relieve the patent pressure that was perceived as stifling the development of photography. Talbot agreed to waive licensing fees for amateurs, but he continued to pursue professional portrait photographers, having filed several lawsuits.

In 1854, Talbot applied for an extension of the 14-year patent. At that time, one of his lawsuits, against photographer Martin Laroche, was heard in court. The &quot;Talbot v. Laroche&quot; case proved to be pivotal. Laroche&#x27;s side argued that the patent was invalid, as a similar process had been invented earlier by Joseph Reade, and that using the collodion process did not infringe the calotype patent in any case, because of significant differences between the two processes. In the verdict, the jury upheld the calotype patent but agreed that Laroche was not infringing upon it by using the collodion process. Disappointed by the outcome, Talbot chose not to extend his patent.

== 1844 calotype of Thomas Moore and the Talbot household ==

Talbot was a friend and neighbour in Wiltshire of the famed Irish poet and writer Thomas Moore. Dated April 1844, Talbot made a calotype of Moore as a visitor standing with members of his own household.

The distinctive curls identify Talbot&#x27;s half sister Henrietta Horatia Fielding standing to his left.  Eliza Frayland, the nursemaid at the far left, had come into the family&#x27;s employ with the birth of Charles Henry Talbot in 1842.  Arranged in the front are Matilda Caroline (later Gilchrist-Clark, age 5); Ela Theresa (age 9);  Rosamond Constance Talbot (age 7).  The woman at the right is possibly Moore&#x27;s wife Bessy.

Moore took an early interest in Talbot&#x27;s photogenic drawings. Talbot, in turn, took images of Moore&#x27;s hand-written poetry possibly for inclusion in facsimile in an edition of &quot;The Pencil of Nature.&quot;

== Spectroscopic and optical investigations ==
Talbot was one of the earliest researchers into the field of spectral analysis. He showed that the spectrum of each of the chemical elements was unique and that it was possible to identify the chemical elements from their spectra. Such analysis was to become important in examining the light from distant stars, and hence inferring their atomic composition. He also investigated the polarization of light using tourmaline crystals and iceland spar or calcite crystals, and pioneered the design and use of the polarizing microscope, now widely used by geologists for examining thin rock sections to identify minerals within them.
Talbot allowed free use of the calotype process for scientific applications, and he himself published the first known photomicrograph of a mineral crystal. Another photomicrograph shows insect wings as seen in the &quot;solar microscope&quot; he and others developed for projecting images onto a large screen of tiny objects using sunlight as a light source. The large projections could then be photographed by exposure to sensitized paper. He studied the diffraction of light using gratings and discovered a new phenomenon, now known as the Talbot effect.

Talbot was very keen on applying the calotype method to recording natural phenomena, such as plants for example, as well as buildings and landscapes. The calotype technique was offered free by Talbot for scientific and amateur use. He was aware that the visible spectrum comprised a very small part of what we now know as electromagnetic radiation, and that powerful and invisible light beyond the violet was capable of inducing chemical effects, a type of radiation we now call ultra-violet radiation.

== Other activities ==

Talbot was active in politics, being a moderate Reformer who generally supported the Whig Ministers. He served as member of parliament for Chippenham between 1832 and 1835 when he retired from parliament. He also held the office of High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1840.

While engaged in his scientific researches, Talbot devoted much time to archaeology. He had a 20-year involvement in the field of Assyriology, the study of the history, archaeology and culture of Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). With Henry Rawlinson and Edward Hincks he shares the honour of having been one of the first decipherers of the cuneiform inscriptions of Nineveh. He published &quot;Hermes, or Classical and Antiquarian Researches&quot; (1838–39), and &quot;Illustrations of the Antiquity of the Book of Genesis&quot; (1839). He was also the author of &quot;English Etymologies&quot; (1846).

<text>The carbon group is a periodic table group consisting of carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), and flerovium (Fl). It lies within the p-block.

In modern IUPAC notation, it is called group 14. In the field of semiconductor physics, it is still universally called group IV. The group is also known as the tetrels (from the Greek word &quot;tetra&quot;, which means four), stemming from the Roman numeral IV in the group name, or (not coincidentally) from the fact that these elements have four valence electrons (see below). They are also known as the crystallogens or adamantogens.

==Characteristics==
===Chemical===
Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in electron configuration, especially in the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior:

Each of the elements in this group has 4 electrons in its outer shell. An isolated, neutral group 14 atom has the s2 p2 configuration in the ground state. These elements, especially carbon and silicon, have a strong propensity for covalent bonding, which usually brings the outer shell to eight electrons. Bonds in these elements often lead to hybridisation where distinct s and p characters of the orbitals are erased. For single bonds, a typical arrangement has four pairs of sp3 electrons, although other cases exist too, such as three sp2 pairs in graphene and graphite. Double bonds are characteristic for carbon (alkenes, ...); the same for π-systems in general. The tendency to lose electrons increases as the size of the atom increases, as it does with increasing atomic number.
Carbon alone forms negative ions, in the form of carbide (C4−) ions.
Silicon and germanium, both metalloids, each can form +4 ions.
Tin and lead both are metals, while flerovium is a synthetic, radioactive (its half life is very short, only 1.9 seconds) element that may have a few noble gas-like properties, though it is still most likely a post-transition metal. Tin and lead are both capable of forming +2 ions. Although tin is chemically a metal, its α allotrope looks more like germanium than like a metal and it is a poor electric conductor.

Among main group (groups 1, 2, 13–17) alkyl derivatives QR&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the standard bonding number for Q (&quot;see&quot; lambda convention), the group 14 derivatives QR4 are notable in being electron-precise: they are neither electron-deficient (having fewer electrons than an octet and tending to be Lewis acidic at Q and usually existing as oligomeric clusters or adducts with Lewis bases) nor electron-excessive (having lone pair(s) at Q and tending to be Lewis basic at Q). As a result, the group 14 alkyls have low chemical reactivity relative to the alkyl derivatives of other groups. In the case of carbon, the high bond dissociation energy of the C–C bond and lack of electronegativity difference between the central atom and the alkyl ligands render the saturated alkyl derivatives, the alkanes, particularly inert.

Carbon forms tetrahalides with all the halogens. Carbon also forms many oxides such as carbon monoxide, carbon suboxide, and carbon dioxide. Carbon forms a disulfide an a diselenide.

Silicon forms several hydrides; two of them are SiH4 and Si2H6. Silicon forms tetrahalides with fluorine (SiF4), chlorine (SiCl4), bromine (SiBr4), and iodine (SiI4). Silicon also forms a dioxide and a disulfide. Silicon nitride has the formula Si3N4.

Germanium forms five hydrides. The first two germanium hydrides are GeH4 and Ge2H6. Germanium forms tetrahalides with all halogens except astatine and forms dihalides with all halogens except bromine and astatine. Germanium bonds to all natural single chalcogens except polonium, and forms dioxides, disulfides, and diselenides. Germanium nitride has the formula Ge3N4.

Tin forms two hydrides: SnH4 and Sn2H6. Tin forms dihalides and tetrahalides with all halogens except astatine. Tin forms monochalcogenides with naturally occurring chalcogens except polonium, and forms dichalcogenides with naturally occurring chalcogens except polonium and tellurium.

Lead forms one hydride, which has the formula PbH4. Lead forms dihalides and tetrahalides with fluorine and chlorine, and forms a dibromide and a diiodide, although the tetrabromide and tetraiodide of lead are unstable. Lead forms four oxides, a sulfide, a selenide, and a telluride.

There are no known compounds of flerovium.

===Physical===
The boiling points of the carbon group tend to get lower with the heavier elements. At standard pressure, carbon, the lightest carbon group element, sublimes at 3825 °C. Silicon&#x27;s boiling point is 3265 °C, germanium&#x27;s is 2833 °C, tin&#x27;s is 2602 °C, and lead&#x27;s is 1749 °C. Flerovium is predicted to boil at −60 °C. The melting points of the carbon group elements have roughly the same trend as their boiling points. Silicon melts at 1414 °C, germanium melts at 939 °C, tin melts at 232 °C, and lead melts at 328 °C.

Carbon&#x27;s crystal structure is hexagonal; at high pressures and temperatures it forms diamond (see below). Silicon and germanium have diamond cubic crystal structures, as does tin at low temperatures (below 13.2 °C). Tin at room temperature has a tetragonal crystal structure. Lead has a face-centered cubic crystal structure.

The densities of the carbon group elements tend to increase with increasing atomic number. Carbon has a density of 2.26 g·cm−3; silicon, 2.33 g·cm−3; germanium, 5.32 g·cm−3; tin, 7.26 g·cm−3; lead, 11.3 g·cm−3.

The atomic radii of the carbon group elements tend to increase with increasing atomic number. Carbon&#x27;s atomic radius is 77 picometers, silicon&#x27;s is 118 picometers, germanium&#x27;s is 123 picometers, tin&#x27;s is 141 picometers, and lead&#x27;s is 175 picometers.

====Allotropes====

Carbon has multiple allotropes. The most common is graphite, which is carbon in the form of stacked sheets. Another form of carbon is diamond, but this is relatively rare. Amorphous carbon is a third allotrope of carbon; it is a component of soot. Another allotrope of carbon is a fullerene, which has the form of sheets of carbon atoms folded into a sphere. A fifth allotrope of carbon, discovered in 2003, is called graphene, and is in the form of a layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb-shaped formation.

Silicon has two known allotropes that exist at room temperature. These allotropes are known as the amorphous and the crystalline allotropes. The amorphous allotrope is a brown powder. The crystalline allotrope is gray and has a metallic luster.

Tin has two allotropes: α-tin, also known as gray tin, and β-tin. Tin is typically found in the β-tin form, a silvery metal. However, at standard pressure, β-tin converts to α-tin, a gray powder, at temperatures below . This can cause tin objects in cold temperatures to crumble to gray powder in a process known as tin pest or tin rot.

===Nuclear===
At least two of the carbon group elements (tin and lead) have magic nuclei, meaning that these elements are more common and more stable than elements that do not have a magic nucleus.

====Isotopes====
There are 15 known isotopes of carbon. Of these, three are naturally occurring. The most common is stable carbon-12, followed by stable carbon-13. Carbon-14 is a natural radioactive isotope with a half-life of 5,730 years.

23 isotopes of silicon have been discovered. Five of these are naturally occurring. The most common is stable silicon-28, followed by stable silicon-29 and stable silicon-30. Silicon-32 is a radioactive isotope that occurs naturally as a result of radioactive decay of actinides, and via spallation in the upper atmosphere. Silicon-34 also occurs naturally as the result of radioactive decay of actinides.

32 isotopes of germanium have been discovered. Five of these are naturally occurring. The most common is the stable germanium-74, followed by stable germanium-72, stable germanium-70, and stable germanium-73. Germanium-76 is a primordial radioisotope.

40 isotopes of tin have been discovered. 14 of these occur in nature. The most common is tin-120, followed by tin-118, tin-116, tin-119, tin-117, tin-124, tin-122, tin-112, and tin-114: all of these are stable. Tin also has four radioisotopes that occur as the result of the radioactive decay of uranium. These isotopes are tin-121, tin-123, tin-125, and tin-126.

38 isotopes of lead have been discovered. 9 of these are naturally occurring. The most common isotope is lead-208, followed by lead-206, lead-207, and lead-204: all of these are stable. 5 isotopes of lead occur from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. These isotopes are lead-209, lead-210, lead-211, lead-212 and lead-214.

6 isotopes of flerovium (flerovium-284, flerovium-285, flerovium-286, flerovium-287, flerovium-288, and flerovium-289) have been discovered, all from human synthesis. Flerovium&#x27;s most stable isotope is flerovium-289, which has a half-life of 2.6 seconds.

==Occurrence==
Carbon accumulates as the result of stellar fusion in most stars, even small ones. Carbon is present in the Earth&#x27;s crust in concentrations of 480 parts per million, and is present in seawater at concentrations of 28 parts per million. Carbon is present in the atmosphere in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane. Carbon is a key constituent of carbonate minerals, and is in hydrogen carbonate, which is common in seawater. Carbon forms 22.8% of a typical human.

Silicon is present in the Earth&#x27;s crust at concentrations of 28%, making it the second most abundant element there. Silicon&#x27;s concentration in seawater can vary from 30 parts per billion on the surface of the ocean to 2000 parts per billion deeper down. Silicon dust occurs in trace amounts in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Silicate minerals are the most common type of mineral on earth. Silicon makes up 14.3 parts per million of the human body on average. Only the largest stars produce silicon via stellar fusion.

Germanium makes up 2 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 52nd most abundant element there. On average, germanium makes up 1 part per million of soil. Germanium makes up 0.5 parts per trillion of seawater. Organogermanium compounds are also found in seawater. Germanium occurs in the human body at concentrations of 71.4 parts per billion. Germanium has been found to exist in some very faraway stars.

Tin makes up 2 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 49th most abundant element there. On average, tin makes up 1 part per million of soil. Tin exists in seawater at concentrations of 4 parts per trillion. Tin makes up 428 parts per billion of the human body. Tin(IV) oxide occurs at concentrations of 0.1 to 300 parts per million in soils. Tin also occurs in concentrations of one part per thousand in igneous rocks.

Lead makes up 14 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 36th most abundant element there. On average, lead makes up 23 parts per million of soil, but the concentration can reach 20000 parts per million (2 percent) near old lead mines. Lead exists in seawater at concentrations of 2 parts per trillion. Lead makes up 1.7 parts per million of the human body by weight. Human activity releases more lead into the environment than any other metal.

Flerovium doesn&#x27;t occur in nature at all, so it only exists in particle accelerators with a few atoms at a time.

==History==
=== Discoveries and uses in antiquity ===
Carbon, tin, and lead are a few of the elements well known in the ancient world, together with sulfur, iron, copper, mercury, silver, and gold.

Silicon as silica in the form of rock crystal was familiar to the predynastic Egyptians, who used it for beads and small vases; to the early Chinese; and probably to many others of the ancients. The manufacture of glass containing silica was carried out both by the Egyptians – at least as early as 1500 BCE – and by the Phoenicians. Many of the naturally occurring compounds or silicate minerals were used in various kinds of mortar for construction of dwellings by the earliest people.

The origins of tin seem to be lost in history. It appears that bronzes, which are alloys of copper and tin, were used by prehistoric man some time before the pure metal was isolated. Bronzes were common in early Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, Egypt, Crete, Israel, and Peru. Much of the tin used by the early Mediterranean peoples apparently came from the Scilly Isles and Cornwall in the British Isles, where mining of the metal dates from about 300–200 BCE. Tin mines were operating in both the Inca and Aztec areas of South and Central America before the Spanish conquest.

Lead is mentioned often in early Biblical accounts. The Babylonians used the metal as plates on which to record inscriptions. The Romans used it for tablets, water pipes, coins, and even cooking utensils; indeed, as a result of the last use, lead poisoning was recognized in the time of Augustus Caesar. The compound known as white lead was apparently prepared as a decorative pigment at least as early as 200 BCE.

===Modern discoveries===
Amorphous elemental silicon was first obtained pure in 1824 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius; impure silicon had already been obtained in 1811. Crystalline elemental silicon was not prepared until 1854, when it was obtained as a product of electrolysis.

Germanium is one of three elements the existence of which was predicted in 1869 by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev when he first devised his periodic table. However, the element was not actually discovered for some time. In September 1885, a miner discovered a mineral sample in a silver mine and gave it to the mine manager, who determined that it was a new mineral and sent the mineral to Clemens A. Winkler. Winkler realized that the sample was 75% silver, 18% sulfur, and 7% of an undiscovered element. After several months, Winkler isolated the element and determined that it was element 32.

The first attempt to discover flerovium (then referred to as &quot;element 114&quot;) was in 1969, at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, but it was unsuccessful. In 1977, researchers at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research bombarded plutonium-244 atoms with calcium-48, but were again unsuccessful. This nuclear reaction was repeated in 1998, this time successfully.

==Applications==
Carbon is most commonly used in its amorphous form. In this form, carbon is used for steelmaking, as carbon black, as a filling in tires, in respirators, and as activated charcoal. Carbon is also used in the form of graphite, for example as the lead in pencils. Diamond, another form of carbon, is commonly used in jewelry. Carbon fibers are used in numerous applications, such as satellite struts, because the fibers are highly strong yet elastic.

Silicon dioxide has a wide variety of applications, including toothpaste, construction fillers, and silica is a major component of glass. 50% of pure silicon is devoted to the manufacture of metal alloys. 45% of silicon is devoted to the manufacture of silicones. Silicon is also commonly used in semiconductors since the 1950s.

Germanium was used in semiconductors until the 1950s, when it was replaced by silicon. Radiation detectors contain germanium. Germanium dioxide is used in fiber optics and wide-angle camera lenses. A small amount of germanium mixed with silver can make silver tarnish-proof. The resulting alloy is known as argentium sterling silver.

Solder is the most important use of tin; 50% of all tin produced goes into this application. 20% of all tin produced is used in tin plate. 20% of tin is used by the chemical industry. Tin is a constituent of numerous alloys, including pewter. Tin(IV) oxide has been commonly used in ceramics for thousands of years. Cobalt stannate is a tin compound which is used as a cerulean blue pigment.

80% of all lead produced goes into lead–acid batteries. Other applications for lead include weights, pigments, and shielding against radioactive materials. Lead was historically used in gasoline in the form of tetraethyllead, but this application has been discontinued due to concerns of toxicity.

==Production==
Carbon&#x27;s allotrope diamond is produced mostly by Russia, Botswana, Congo, Canada, South Africa, and India. 80% of all synthetic diamonds are produced by Russia. China produces 70% of the world&#x27;s graphite. Other graphite-mining countries are Brazil, Canada, and Mexico.

Silicon can be produced by heating silica with carbon.

There are some germanium ores, such as germanite, but these are not mined on account of being rare. Instead, germanium is extracted from the ores of metals such as zinc. In Russia and China, germanium is also separated from coal deposits. Germanium-containing ores are first treated with chlorine to form germanium tetrachloride, which is mixed with hydrogen gas. Then the germanium is further refined by zone refining. Roughly 140 metric tons of germanium are produced each year.

Mines output 300,000 metric tons of tin each year. China, Indonesia, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil are the main producers of tin. The method by which tin is produced is to heat the tin mineral cassiterite (SnO2) with coke.

The most commonly mined lead ore is galena (lead sulfide). 4 million metric tons of lead are newly mined each year, mostly in China, Australia, the United States, and Peru. The ores are mixed with coke and limestone and roasted to produce pure lead. Most lead is recycled from lead batteries. The total amount of lead ever mined by humans amounts to 350 million metric tons.

==Biological role==
Carbon is a key element to all known life. It is in all organic compounds, for example, DNA, steroids, and proteins. Carbon&#x27;s importance to life is primarily due to its ability to form numerous bonds with other elements. There are 16 kilograms of carbon in a typical 70-kilogram human.

Silicon-based life&#x27;s feasibility is commonly discussed. However, it is less able than carbon to form elaborate rings and chains. Silicon in the form of silicon dioxide is used by diatoms and sea sponges to form their cell walls and skeletons. Silicon is essential for bone growth in chickens and rats and may also be essential in humans. Humans consume on average between 20 and 1200 milligrams of silicon per day, mostly from cereals. There is 1 gram of silicon in a typical 70-kilogram human.

A biological role for germanium is not known, although it does stimulate metabolism. In 1980, germanium was reported by Kazuhiko Asai to benefit health, but the claim has not been proven. Some plants take up germanium from the soil in the form of germanium oxide. These plants, which include grains and vegetables contain roughly 0.05 parts per million of germanium. The estimated human intake of germanium is 1 milligram per day. There are 5 milligrams of germanium in a typical 70-kilogram human.

Tin has been shown to be essential for proper growth in rats, but there is, as of 2013, no evidence to indicate that humans need tin in their diet. Plants do not require tin. However, plants do collect tin in their roots. Wheat and maize contain 7 and 3 parts per million respectively. However, the level of tin in plants can reach 2000 parts per million if the plants are near a tin smelter. On average, humans consume 0.3 milligrams of tin per day. There are 30 milligrams of tin in a typical 70-kilogram human.

Lead has no known biological role, and is in fact highly toxic, but some microbes are able to survive in lead-contaminated environments. Some plants, such as cucumbers contain up to tens of parts per million of lead. There are 120 milligrams of lead in a typical 70-kilogram human.

Flerovium has no biological role and instead is found and made only in particle accelerators.

===Toxicity===
Elemental carbon is not generally toxic, but many of its compounds are, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. However, carbon dust can be dangerous because it lodges in the lungs in a manner similar to asbestos.

Silicon minerals are not typically poisonous. However, silicon dioxide dust, such as that emitted by volcanoes can cause adverse health effects if it enters the lungs.

Germanium can interfere with such enzymes as lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. Organic germanium compounds are more toxic than inorganic germanium compounds. Germanium has a low degree of oral toxicity in animals. Severe germanium poisoning can cause death by respiratory paralysis.

Some tin compounds are toxic to ingest, but most inorganic compounds of tin are considered nontoxic. Organic tin compounds, such as trimethyltin and triethyltin are highly toxic, and can disrupt metabolic processes inside cells.

Lead and its compounds, such as lead acetates are highly toxic. Lead poisoning can cause headaches, stomach pain, constipation, and gout.

Flerovium is too radioactive to test if it&#x27;s toxic or not although its high radioactivity alone would be toxic.

<text>Perry or pear cider is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented pears, traditionally in England (particularly Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire), parts of South Wales, France (especially Normandy and Anjou), Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. There is growing interest in artisanal perry production in the fruit-growing regions of the northwest United States (Oregon and Washington State).

==Production==
===Fruit===

The pears used to make perry are typically not the large, sweet varieties eaten as fresh fruit. Perry pears tend to be small and relatively the distiction between table pears and perry pears is similar to the distiction between table apples and cider apples. Perry pears are thought to be descended from wild hybrids, known as &quot;wildings&quot;, between the cultivated pear &quot;Pyrus communis&quot; subsp. &quot;communis&quot; and the now-rare wild pear &quot;Pyrus communis&quot; subsp. &quot;pyraster&quot;. The cultivated pear &quot;P. communis&quot; was brought to northern Europe by the Romans. In the fourth century CE Saint Jerome referred to perry as &quot;piracium&quot;. Wild pear hybrids were, over time, selected locally for desirable qualities, and, by the 1800s, many regional varieties had been identified.
The majority of perry pear varieties in the UK originate from the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire in the west of England; perry from these counties made from traditional recipes now forms a European Union Protected Geographical Indication. Of these perry pear varieties, most originate in parishes around May Hill on the Gloucestershire/Herefordshire border. The standard reference work on perry pears was published in 1963 by the Long Ashton Research Station; since then, many varieties have become critically endangered or lost. Over 100 varieties, known by over 200 local names, were in Gloucestershire alone. These local pears are particularly known for their picturesque names, such as the various &quot;Huffcap&quot; varieties (&#x27;Hendre Huffcap&#x27;, &#x27;Red Huffcap&#x27;, &#x27;Black Huffcap&#x27;, all having an elliptical shape), those named for the effects of their product (&#x27;Merrylegs&#x27;, &#x27;Mumblehead&#x27;), pears commemorating an individual (&#x27;Stinking Bishop&#x27;, named for the man who first grew it, or &#x27;Judge Amphlett&#x27;, named for Assizes court judge Richard Amphlett), or those named for the place they grew (&#x27;Hartpury Green&#x27;, &#x27;Bosbury Scarlet&#x27;, &#x27;Bartestree Squash&#x27;). The perry makers of Normandy grew their own distinctive varieties such as &quot;Plant de Blanc&quot;, &quot;Antricotin&quot; and &quot;Fausset&quot;; the perry of Domfront, which has been recognised with AOC status since 2002 and PDO status since 2006, must be made with a minimum of 40% &quot;Plant de Blanc&quot;.

Pear cultivars used for perry-making tend to be small in size, turbinate or pyriform in shape, and too astringent for culinary use. Specific perry pear cultivars are regularly used to make single-variety perries; this was formerly the usual practice in traditional perry making, meaning that in the past, each parish would have produced its own characteristic and distinctive perries due to the very restricted distribution of many varieties. Blended perries, made from the juices of several varieties, were traditionally disregarded as they tended to throw a haze, though in modern commercial production, this is overcome with filtration and use of a centrifuge.

Good perry pears should have higher concentrations of tannins, acids, and other phenolic compounds. Some of the pears considered to produce consistently excellent perry include the &#x27;Barland&#x27;, &#x27;Brandy&#x27;, &#x27;Thorn,&#x27; and &#x27;Yellow Huffcap&#x27; cultivars. Compared to cider apples, perry pears have fewer volatile components and consequently fewer aromatics in the finished product. Their tannin profile is very different from that of cider apples, with a predominance of astringent over bitter flavours. They do, however, contain a high concentration of deca-2,4-dienoate, a group of esters that affords them their prominent pear aroma. Another important attribute of perry pears that distinguishes them from cider apples is their relatively higher content ratio of sorbitol to other sugars, such as fructose. Because sorbitol is not readily fermented by yeast, it is not converted to ethanol, so perry tends to have more residual sugar than cider produced from the fermentation of apples. In addition to producing a sweeter beverage, sorbitol also contributes to increased body and a softer mouthfeel in the finished perry. Compared to apples, pear pressing is made more difficult by the additional presence of specialized cells known as sclereids, which have thick cell walls that provide extra support and strength to the pear tissue. Because of this inherent perry pear attribute, the addition of enzymes and pressing aids is a commonly used practice for improving perry production.
===Orchard management and harvesting===
While cultivation of pears has been to some extent modernised, they remain a difficult crop to grow. Perry pear trees can live to a great age, and can be fully productive for 250 years. Pear trees, both domestic and perry varieties, grow incredibly slowly, taking up to, if not over, a decade before they bear enough fruit for harvest. They also grow to a considerable height and can have very large canopies; the largest recorded, a tree at Holme Lacy, which still partly survives, covered three-quarters of an acre and yielded a crop of 5–7 tons in 1790. Given the long maturing period of pear trees, they can be difficult to manage against diseases. Their size makes it difficult to apply pesticides, which makes preventing fire blight, a disease caused by the bacterium &quot;Erwinia amylovora&quot; that pears are even more susceptible to than cider apples, quite challenging. These difficulties, along with demand for perry pears having (until recently) taken a decline, have prompted a national collection of perry pear cultivars to be gathered, housed, and cared for at the Three Counties Agricultural Showground at Malvern in Worcestershire, to maintain genetic resources, which has now become the National Perry Pear Centre at Hartpury. Similar germplasm repositories can be found at the National Clonal Germplasm Repository in Corvallis, Oregon.

Also, key differences between cider and perry production exist in the harvesting and growing processes. Perry trees famously take more time to mature than cider trees. While cider trees may come to bear fruit in three to five years, traditionally managed perry trees typically take much longer, so much so that people say that one plants &quot;pears for your heirs&quot;.

Even when fully grown, pear trees bear less fruit than apples, which is one reason that perry is less common than cider. When time to harvest comes, pears should be picked before they are ripe and then left to ripen indoors, while apples should be allowed to ripen on the tree. Both apples and pears suffer from fire blight, which can devastate entire orchards, but pears are also susceptible to pear psylla (also known as &quot;Psylla pyri&quot;). These insects kill the entire pear tree and are very resistant to insecticides, making them a severe problem for pear orchards. Another added complication is that while apples are often harvested mechanically, pears must be harvested by hand, greatly increasing the time and cost of harvesting.

===Perry-making technique===

Traditional perry making is broadly similar to traditional cider making, in that the fruit is picked, crushed, and pressed to extract the juice, which is then fermented using the wild yeasts found on the fruit&#x27;s skin. Traditional perry making employed querns and a rack and cloth press, in which the pulp is wrapped in cloth before being squeezed with a press. Modern perry production can use a belt press, which is much more efficient for pressing fruit. It works by sending the fruit down a conveyor belt, on which it is then pressed by rollers. The principal differences between perry and cider production are that pears must be left for a period to mature after picking, and the pomace must be left to stand after initial crushing to lose tannins, a process analogous to wine maceration. Additionally, because of the variation in hardness of the fruit, determining if a pear is ready for pressing than an apple can be more difficult. Also, key chemical compositional differences occur between apples and pears; these factors play a crucial role in prefermentation and fermentation decisions for perry production.
Compared to most apples, pears tend to have more sugar and total phenolic compounds. The main sugars in perry pears are glucose (192 –284 mg/L), xylose (140–176 mg/g), and galacturonic acid (108–118 mg/g). Types of sugar that are present in the juice play an important role in yeast activity and determine the success of fermentation. Unlike the juice of apples, pear juice contains significant quantities of unfermentable sugar alcohols, particularly sorbitol. The presence of sorbitol can give perry a residual sweetness, in addition to a mild laxative effect.
Pear juices contain rather low levels of amino acids, sources of nitrogen such as aspargine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

After initial fermentation, many perries go through malolactic fermentation. On average, compared to apples, pears have higher levels of titrable acidity, most of it being citric acid. In environments with high levels of malic acid, such as grape must in winemaking, malolactic fermentation bacteria convert malic acid to lactic acid, reducing the perception of acidity and increasing complexity of flavour. However, if high levels of citric acid are present, as in pear pomace, malolactic fermentation bacteria catabolise citric acid to acetic acid and oxaloacetic acid, instead of lactic acid. This results in a floral, citrus-like aroma in the final product, lacking the diacethyl odour typical for most products that have undergone a malolactic fermentation.

==History==
The earliest known reference to fermented alcoholic drinks being made from pears is found in Pliny. Perry making seems to have become well established in what is today France following the collapse of the Roman empire; references to perry making in England do not appear before the Norman conquest. In the medieval period, France retained its association with pear growing, and the majority of pears consumed in England were in fact imported from France.

By the 16th and 17th centuries, however, perry making had become well established in the west of England, where the climate and soil were especially suitable for pear cultivation. In the three counties of Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and Herefordshire in particular, as well as in Monmouthshire across the Welsh border, perry pears grew well in conditions where cider apple trees would not. Smaller amounts were also produced in other cider-producing areas, such as Somerset. Perry may have grown in popularity after the English Civil War, when the large numbers of soldiers billeted in the Three Counties became acquainted with it, and reached a zenith of popularity during the 18th century, when intermittent conflicts with France made the importing of wine difficult. Many farms and estates had their own orchards, and many varieties of pears developed that were unique to particular parishes or villages.

Whereas perry in England remained an overwhelmingly dry, still drink served from the cask, Normandy perry (&quot;poiré&quot;) developed a bottle-fermented, sparkling style with a good deal of sweetness.

===Modern commercial perries===
The production of traditional perry began to decline during the 20th century, in part due to changing farming practices– perry pears could be difficult and labour-intensive to crop, and orchards took many years to mature. The industry was, however, to a certain degree revived by modern commercial perry-making techniques, developed by Francis Showering of the firm Showerings of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in the creation of their sparkling branded perry Babycham. Babycham, the first mass-produced branded perry, was developed by Showering from application of the Long Ashton Institute&#x27;s research, and was formerly produced from authentic perry pears, though today it is produced from concentrate, the firm&#x27;s pear orchards having now been dug up. Aimed at the female drinker at a time when wine was not commonly available in UK pubs, Babycham was sold in miniature Champagne-style bottles; the drink was for many years a strong seller and made a fortune for the Showering family. A competing brand of commercial perry, Lambrini, is manufactured in Liverpool by Halewood International. The Irish drinks company Cantrell and Cochrane, Plc, more famous for its Magners and Bulmers ciders, launched a similar light perry, Ritz, in 1986.

Like commercial lager and commercial cider, commercial perry is highly standardised, and today often contains large quantities of cereal adjuncts such as corn syrup or invert sugar. It is also generally of lower strength, and sweeter, than traditional perry, and is artificially carbonated to give a sparkling finish. Unlike traditional perry, its manufacture guarantees a consistent product; the nature of perry pears means producing traditional perry in commercial quantities is very difficult. Traditional perry was overwhelmingly a drink made on farms for home consumption, or to sell in small quantities either at the farm gate or to local inns.

===Decline and revival of traditional perry===
Both English perry making and the orchards that supplied it suffered a catastrophic decline in the second half of the 20th century as a result of changing tastes and agricultural practices (in South Gloucestershire alone, an estimated 90% of orchards were lost in the last 75 years). Many pear orchards were also lost to fire blight in the 1970s and 1980s. Along with the clearing of orchards, the decline of day labouring on farms meant that the manpower that was once devoted to harvest perry pears – as well as its traditional consumers – disappeared. It also lost popularity due to makers turning to dessert or general-purpose pears in its manufacture rather than perry pears, resulting in a thin and tasteless product. In the UK, before 2007, the small amounts of traditional perry still produced were mainly consumed by people living in farming communities.

However, perry (often marketed under the name &quot;pear cider&quot;, see below) has increased in popularity in very recent times, with around 2.5 million British consumers purchasing it in one year. In addition, various organisations have been actively seeking out old perry pear trees and orchards and rediscovering lost varieties, many of which now exist only as single trees on isolated farms. For example, the Welsh Cider Society rediscovered the old Monmouthshire varieties &#x27;Burgundy&#x27; and the &#x27;Potato Pear&#x27;, as well as a number of further types unrecorded up to that point.

==Naming controversy==
Pear cider has been used as an alternative name for alcoholic drinks containing pear juice, in preference to the term perry. The term has been dated to 1995, when Brothers Cider found that nobody at Glastonbury Festival understood what perry was; they began telling customers that it was &#x27;like cider, but made from pears&#x27;.

In the UK the new name has caused controversy. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) defines perry and pear cider as different drinks, stating that &#x27;pear cider&#x27; as made by the large industrial cidermakers is a pear-flavoured drink, or more specifically a cider-style drink flavoured with pear concentrate, whereas &#x27;perry&#x27; should be made by traditional methods from perry pears only. The National Association of Cider Makers maintain that the terms perry and pear cider are interchangeable, and its rules specify that perry or pear cider may contain no more than 25% apple juice.

<doc id="99823" wikidata="Q904733" url="?curid=99823" title="Dexter's Laboratory">
<text>Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory is an American animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network. The series follows Dexter, an enthusiastic boy-genius with a science laboratory in his bedroom, which he keeps secret from his unsuspecting parents. Dexter is at constant odds with his older and more extraverted sister Dee Dee, who regularly accesses the laboratory and inadvertently foils his experiments. Mandark, a nefarious boy-genius classmate who lives next-door to Dexter, attempts to undermine him at every opportunity. Prominently featured in the first and second seasons are other segments focusing on superhero-based characters Monkey, Dexter&#x27;s pet lab-monkey with a superhero alter ego, and the Justice Friends, a trio of superheroes who share an apartment.

Tartakovsky pitched the series to Fred Seibert&#x27;s animated shorts showcase &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; at Hanna-Barbera, basing it on student films he produced at the California Institute of the Arts. Four pilots aired on Cartoon Network and TNT from 1995 to 1996. Viewer approval ratings led to a half-hour series, which consisted of two seasons totaling 52 episodes, airing from April 27, 1996, to June 15, 1998. &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was the first original series for the channel under the Cartoon Cartoons moniker. On December 10, 1999, a television film titled &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory: Ego Trip&quot; aired as the intended series finale, after which Tartakovsky focused his work on another series for Cartoon Network, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;.

In November 2000, the series was renewed for two seasons, which began airing on November 18, 2001. Due to Tartakovsky&#x27;s departure, Chris Savino served as showrunner, and a new team at Cartoon Network Studios produced the series. After 26 episodes, the fourth season concluded on November 20, 2003, ending the series.

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, particularly its first two seasons, received critical acclaim and became one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s most successful original series. It won three Annie Awards, with nominations for four Primetime Emmy Awards, four Golden Reel Awards, and nine other Annie Awards. Animators Craig McCracken, Seth MacFarlane, Butch Hartman, Paul Rudish, and Rob Renzetti worked on the series and later achieved further success in their careers in animation. Spin-off media include children&#x27;s books, comic books, DVD and VHS releases, music albums, toys, and video games.

== Premise ==

=== Characters ===
Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1–3; Candi Milo in seasons 3–4) is a bespectacled boy-genius who, behind a bookcase in his bedroom, conceals a secret laboratory, which can be accessed by spoken passwords or hidden switches on his bookshelf. Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails to achieve his goals when he becomes overexcited and careless. Tartakovsky described Dexter as &quot;a good kid. He&#x27;s very ambitious. And he&#x27;s very frustrated that everyone isn&#x27;t as smart as him.&quot; Although he comes from a typical American family, Dexter speaks with an accent of indeterminate origin. Christine Cavanaugh described it as &quot;an affectation, [a] kind of accent, we&#x27;re not quite sure. A small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he&#x27;s Latino, perhaps he&#x27;s French. He&#x27;s a scientist; he knows he needs [a] kind of accent.&quot; Genndy Tartakovsky explained, &quot;he&#x27;s a scientist. All scientists are foreign and have accents...It&#x27;s not really a German accent. It&#x27;s just Eastern European.&quot; Tartakovsky later declared Cavanaugh&#x27;s input for Dexter to be irreplaceable as he acknowledged her legacy.

Dexter conceals his lab from his clueless parents, addressed only as Mom (voiced by Kath Soucie) and Dad (voiced by Jeff Bennett), who Tartakovsky described as simplified stereotypes of &quot;ideal parents&quot;. His hyperactive, carefree, older sister Dee Dee (voiced by Allison Moore in seasons 1 and 3 and by Kat Cressida in seasons 2 and 4) delights in playing haphazardly in the laboratory, wreaking havoc with Dexter&#x27;s inventions. Though seemingly dim-witted, Dee Dee, a talented ballet dancer, often outsmarts her brother and even provides him helpful advice. According to Tartakovsky, &quot;Dee Dee is the life, she&#x27;s the spirit, everything is fun. There&#x27;s no hardship in life.&quot; When Tartakovsky was asked whether he and his brother Alex had a similar sibling relationship, he stated, &quot;There&#x27;s a little bit of Dee Dee and Dexter in that. He has science and he doesn&#x27;t want Dee Dee in his lab. My brother is Dexter. I&#x27;m Dee Dee.&quot;

Dexter&#x27;s nemesis is rival classmate Mandark Astronomonov (voiced by Eddie Deezen). Like Dexter, Mandark is a boy genius with his own laboratory, but his schemes are generally evil and designed to gain power or downplay or destroy Dexter&#x27;s accomplishments. In revival seasons, Mandark becomes significantly more evil, becoming Dexter&#x27;s enemy rather than his rival, and Mandark&#x27;s laboratory changes from brightly lit with rounded features to gothic-looking, industrial, and angular. Mandark&#x27;s unrequited love for Dee Dee is shown as a pivotal weakness, notably near the end of the &quot;Ego Trip&quot; television film.

=== Recurring segments ===
Every &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; episode, with the exception of &quot;Last But Not Beast&quot;, is divided into different stories or segments, each being 7–12 minutes long. Occasionally, a segment centers on characters other than Dexter and his family. Two segments are shown primarily during season 1: &quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot; and &quot;The Justice Friends&quot;. &quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot; is the middle segment for six episodes of season 1, and &quot;The Justice Friends&quot; takes its place until season 1&#x27;s end. With rare exception, extra segments do not appear after season 1. Other recurring characters include Puppet Pal Mitch (voiced by Rob Paulsen) and Puppet Pal Clem (voiced by Tom Kenny).

==== &quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot; ====
&quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot; follows Monkey (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker), Dexter&#x27;s pet laboratory monkey who is secretly a crime-fighting superhero. Monkey&#x27;s superpowers include super-strength, telekinesis, flight, and super speed. He is joined by his partner Agent Honeydew (voiced by Kath Soucie), Commander General (voiced by Robert Ridgely in season 1, Earl Boen in season 2), and a team of assembled superheroes. &quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot; was created by Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, and Paul Rudish.

==== &quot;The Justice Friends&quot; ====
&quot;The Justice Friends&quot; follows Major Glory (voiced by Rob Paulsen), Valhallen (voiced by Tom Kenny), and the Infraggable Krunk (voiced by Frank Welker), a trio of superhero roommates residing in an apartment called Muscular Arms. Their adventures deal less with superhero life and more with an inability to agree with each other; it is presented much like a sitcom, including a laugh track. Genndy Tartakovsky&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;The Justice Friends&quot; came from reading Marvel Comics while learning how to speak English. In a 2001 &quot;IGN&quot; interview, Tartakovsky expressed disappointment with how &quot;The Justice Friends&quot; turned out, saying, &quot;it could have been funnier and the characters could have been fleshed out more.&quot;

== Production ==
=== Background ===
Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, was born in Moscow, where his father, a dentist, served in the government of the Soviet Union. Although relatively wealthy and well-connected, his family feared racial persecution due to their Jewish heritage and moved from Russia to Chicago when Tartakovsky was seven. Along with his older brother, Alex, Tartakovsky learned English by watching cartoons and taught himself how to draw as a child by copying comic books.

Tartakovsky initially went to Columbia College Chicago to study advertising and took an animation class as an elective. After he transferred to the California Institute of the Arts in 1990 to study animation full-time, Tartakovsky wrote, directed, animated, and produced two student short films, one of which was a precursor to &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;&#x27;s television pilot, &quot;Changes&quot;. A two-and-a-half-minute pencil test, this short film was included in a university screening for the producers of &quot;&quot;, who were impressed and hired Tartakovsky to move to Spain to work on &quot;Batman&quot; at a studio in Madrid.

After &quot;Batman&quot;, Tartakovsky moved back to California to work for Hanna-Barbera on the production team of &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;. His co-workers on that series, Craig McCracken, Rob Renzetti, and Paul Rudish, had been classmates of his at Cal Arts and went on to collaborate with him on &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;. Tartakovsky&#x27;s last job before developing &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; into a television series was to serve as a sheet timer on &quot;The Critic&quot;. During his time on that series, Tartakovsky received a phone call from Larry Huber, who had been a producer on &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;. Huber had shown Tartakovsky&#x27;s unfinished student film to a then-nascent Cartoon Network and wanted Tartakovsky to develop the concept into a seven-minute storyboard.

=== Development ===
Unhappy with his position on &quot;The Critic&quot;, Tartakovsky accepted Huber&#x27;s proposal, and the resulting project, &quot;Changes&quot;, was produced as part of Cartoon Network&#x27;s animation showcase series, &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot;, debuting on February 26, 1995. Viewers worldwide voted through phone lines, websites, focus groups, and consumer promotions for their favorite short cartoons; &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was the first of 16 to earn that vote of approval. Mike Lazzo, then-head of programming for Cartoon Network, said in 1996 that it was his favorite of the 48 shorts that had been produced by that point, commenting that he and colleagues &quot;loved the humor in the brother-versus-sister relationship&quot;.

Even after &quot;Changes&quot; premiered, Tartakovsky had no expectations that it would lead to an entire series. In 2018, he noted that his generation was the first in which people could become showrunners at a young age, saying, &quot;Everybody before us were in their forties, at least, and so [our generation&#x27;s experience] was a very different way to do something where we had no clue what we were doing and we were just trying to make each other laugh.&quot; When &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; received a series greenlight, Tartakovsky became, at age twenty-seven, one of the youngest animation directors of that era. Speaking with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2002, Tartakovsky remarked about the network, &quot;With Cartoon Network, they were looking for more undiscovered talent, people that may have had a hard time getting in.[...]It became a great opportunity to do something. And as I got into it, I realized that they were also offering the creative freedom. They were letting the creators make the shows.&quot;

In August 1995, Turner ordered six half-hour episodes of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, which included two cartoons of one spin-off segment titled &quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot;. In addition to Tartakovsky, McCracken, Renzetti, and Rudish, directors and writers on &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; included Seth MacFarlane, Butch Hartman, John McIntyre, Robert Alvarez, and Chris Savino. McCracken served as an art director on the series. Perlmutter described McCracken&#x27;s role on &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; as that of Tartakovsky&#x27;s &quot;effective second-in-command&quot;.

=== Style and influences ===

Tartakovsky&#x27;s former classmates McCracken and Rudish helped him design &quot;Changes&quot;. This pilot was revised to create a second cut, as Tartakovsky felt utterly dissatisfied with the score, the sound effects, and the entire second half, which he chose to redo entirely. After seeing the revision, producer Fred Seibert felt convinced that the concept for &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; could be successful. Soon afterward, Tartakovsky helped McCracken create his own short film for &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot;, which would eventually become the basis for &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. After finishing McCracken&#x27;s project, the group proceeded to work on a second short film for &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, titled &quot;The Big Sister&quot;. At the time, Tartakovsky was still not anticipating a series greenlight for &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;. He went on to reminisce that, in those days, he was simply having fun working on short films with his friends. Tartakovsky and McCracken, who had been roommates shortly after college, went on to become regular collaborators on each other&#x27;s series. Animation historian David Perlmutter noted a symbiosis between the two men, which he felt led to stylistic similarities between &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;.

Tartakovsky drew inspiration from his experiences as an immigrant growing up in Chicago. He explained that, like Dexter, he had a &quot;very thick accent&quot; as a child—and even though he lived in a diverse neighborhood, children would tease him for this. Speaking with &quot;The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles&quot; in 2001, Tartakovsky explained, &quot;When I moved to America, I wanted to fit in and be American...We never tried to be too heavy-handed with &quot;Dexter&#x27;s&quot;, but if you look at the underlying themes of the show, it&#x27;s about a little kid trying to fit in.&quot; Tartakovsky noted that when he was a child, he was less confident than the character, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The one thing about Dexter, if he doesn&#x27;t fit in, he&#x27;ll start his own club. He&#x27;s not afraid to be an outsider.&quot; In developing &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, he continued the tradition of making &quot;violent cartoons&quot;, explaining that &quot;many people like them because they project themselves in the drawings and they laugh,&quot; while following the principles of older Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

Linda Simensky, who served as senior vice-president of Original Animation for Cartoon Network during the production of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, wrote in 2011 that Dexter was designed &quot;to be more of an icon in some ways&quot;; she continued, &quot;his body was short and squat and his design was simple, with a black outline and relatively little detail... Since Tartakovsky knew he was developing &quot;Dexter&quot; for television, he purposely limited the design to a degree, designing the nose and mouth, for instance, in a Hanna-Barbera style to animate easily.&quot;

This simplistic style was influenced by UPA shorts, as well as by the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon &quot;The Dover Boys at Pimento University&quot;. Simensky noted though, that in contrast to those cartoons, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; is &quot;staged cinematically, rather than flat and close to the screen, to leave space and depth for the action and gags in the lab&quot;. Tartakovsky was influenced by Warner Bros. cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, and Japanese anime. Sam Raimi&#x27;s films &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; heavily influenced the series&#x27; visual style. Referring to a scene from &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; featuring the construction of a robotic hand, McCracken explained, &quot;He [Tartakovsky] applied that sequence to the show all the time, especially when Dexter was building stuff.&quot;

=== Character conception ===

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; has its origins in a drawing of a tall, thin girl dancing next to a short and blocky boy that Tartakovsky made while at CalArts. These two characters would eventually develop into Dee Dee and Dexter respectively, although they went unnamed until Tartakovsky started expanding the concept for Cartoon Network. To further contrast the two characters, Tartakovsky determined that Dee Dee would be artistic, while Dexter would be focused on science. In an interview, Tartakovsky said, &quot;Dee Dee came first. She was really the star of the show to me. She was so much fun. Later on, I started on Dexter and he took over.&quot;

The names Dexter and Dee Dee were both found in name books; &quot;Dexter&quot; caught Tartakovsky&#x27;s attention for sounding scientific, while &quot;Dee Dee&quot; appealed to him because of its uniqueness and because he felt that it complemented that character&#x27;s two pigtails. Before settling on these options, Tartakovsky had considered titling the series &quot;Dartmouth and Daisy&quot;. Explaining why he discarded this idea, Tartakovsky said that &quot;Dartmouth doesn&#x27;t exactly roll off the tongue&quot; and that the name Daisy was already heavily associated with Disney. The title &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was not settled on until around midway through production of the series&#x27; pilot episode, &quot;Changes&quot;.

The ages of Dexter and Dee Dee are meant to be nebulous. Although Tartakovsky suggested that Dexter is intended to be about six to eight years old and that Dee Dee is &quot;a couple years older&quot;, he stressed that he would &quot;never want&quot; to specify Dexter&#x27;s exact age. Tartakovsky wrote Dexter as a hardworking, unspoiled &quot;Midwest kid&quot; who loves food and explained, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying he&#x27;s from Chicago, but there&#x27;s a reason he&#x27;s got his own burrito palace, just like I had growing up in Chicago.&quot;

The sibling dynamic in &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was partially modeled on Tartakovsky&#x27;s relationship with his older brother, Alex. Comparing himself to Dee Dee and Alex, who became a computer engineer, to Dexter, Tartakovsky acknowledged that he was most likely a &quot;pest&quot; to his older brother while they were growing up. Another time, he reminisced that as kids, he and his brother could each be a &quot;pain in the ass&quot; to the other. To illustrate one of the parallels between his childhood and the series, Tartakovsky noted that Alex had kept him from playing with &quot;intricate&quot; toy soldiers in those days, much like Dexter attempts to keep Dee Dee away from his inventions.

Tartakovsky determined that Dexter should have an accent because the character &quot;considers himself a very serious scientist, and all well-known scientists have accents.&quot; During one interview, Tartakovsky suggested that viewers should decide for themselves whether or not the character&#x27;s accent is an affectation, saying that &quot;[n]obody knows&quot; whether the character is &quot;pretending to be a German scientist&quot; or is speaking naturally. Although Tartakovsky noted in a separate interview that Dexter&#x27;s accent is not meant to denote any specific nationality, he revealed in a 2012 Reddit AMA that it was partially inspired by &quot;a funny French accent&quot; done by his college roommate. When Candi Milo took over the role of Dexter in season 3, she had trouble replicating Cavanaugh&#x27;s performance until she met Tartakovsky and realized Cavanaugh was imitating his Russian accent (albeit some exaggeration).

=== Original run ===

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; premiered on TNT on April 27, 1996, and the following day on Cartoon Network and TBS. It became the first in a brand of Cartoon Network original cartoons, later including &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot;, and &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;, collectively known as Cartoon Cartoons. A second season was ordered, which premiered on Cartoon Network on July 16, 1997. This season includes &quot;Dexter and Computress Get Mandark!&quot;, an episode created by six-year-old Long Island resident Tyler Samuel Lee, who submitted his idea to Tartakovsky as an audiotape. Lee&#x27;s recorded narration is used in the episode, and Tartakovsky (who often received letters and comments from other fans) said that Lee had &quot;a great understanding of the show and genuinely captured the imaginative kid perspective we&#x27;re always striving for.&quot; Composers Thomas Chase, Steve Rucker, and Gary Lionelli provided the musical score for the series.

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; went on hiatus on June 15, 1998, after two seasons, with season 2 lasting 39 episodes. The series finale was initially intended to be &quot;Last But Not Beast&quot;, which differed from the format of other episodes, in that it was a single 25-minute episode, rather than a collection of shorter segments. By this point, Tartakovsky was exhausted. His focus on the series had cost him two relationships, and he went on to joke that the process of running &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was like &quot;giving birth to ten children.&quot; After putting the series on hiatus, Tartakovsky became a supervising producer on colleague Craig McCracken&#x27;s series, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;; he directed episodes of that series and worked on &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie.&quot; After the movie, McCracken went on to create &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; for Cartoon Network. Both Hartman and MacFarlane left Cartoon Network altogether at this point; the former went on to create &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; and &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; for Nickelodeon while the latter went on to create &quot;Family Guy&quot; for Fox respectively.

In 1999, Tartakovsky returned to direct &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory: Ego Trip&quot;, an hour-long television movie. It was his last &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; production to be involved with and was intended to be its conclusion. &quot;Ego Trip&quot; was hand-animated, though character and setting designs were subtly revised. Its plot follows Dexter on a quest through time to discover his future triumphs. It premiered on December 10, 1999, at 7:00 PM with a repeat broadcast on January 1, 2000, at 12:00 AM.

=== Revival ===
On February 21, 2001, Cartoon Network issued a press release stating that &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; had been revived for a 13-episode third season. The series was given a new production team at Cartoon Network Studios, and Chris Savino took over the role of creative director from Tartakovsky, who at the time was immersed in launching his next series, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;. During season four of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, Savino was promoted to producer giving him further control of the series, including the budget. Revival episodes featured revised visual designs and sound effects, recast voice actors, and a transition from traditional cel animation, which was used until &quot;Ego Trip&quot;, to digital ink and paint, which was used permanently beginning with season three&#x27;s premiere.

Christine Cavanaugh voiced Dexter for early episodes of season three, but she retired from voice acting in 2001 for personal reasons. She was replaced by Candi Milo. Allison Moore, a college friend of Tartakovsky, was cast as Dee Dee. Moore&#x27;s role was later recast with Kat Cressida. In season three, Moore briefly returned to voice Dee Dee before Cressida again assumed her role for season four. Character redesigns were handled with the help of one of Dexter&#x27;s original model designers, Chris Battle, known individually for acting as character designer for Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; and Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. Aaron Springer and Chris Reccardi are credited on the writing staff, as is &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane.

In 2023, Tartakovsky said he was uninterested in attempting to reboot &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; due to Cavanaugh&#x27;s death in 2014, as well as the &quot;overabundance&quot; of recent reboots of cartoons.

== Episodes ==

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; broadcast 78 half-hour episodes over 4 seasons during its 7-year run. Four pilot shorts were produced for &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; that aired from 1995 to 1996, and were reconnected into season 1 in later airings. Fifty-two episodes were produced from 1996 to 1998, followed by &quot;Ego Trip&quot; in 1999.

Another 26 episodes were produced and broadcast from 2001 to 2003. &quot;Chicken Scratch&quot; debuted theatrically with &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; in 2002, and was later broadcast in season four.

== Broadcast ==
&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; premiered on February 26, 1995, on Cartoon Network as part of &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;. On October 8, 2000, Cartoon Network aired the &quot;Favorite Dexters&quot; marathon from 12 PM to 7 PM Eastern. On December 31, 2000, Cartoon Network aired its &quot;New Year&#x27;s Bash&quot; marathon featuring &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; among other programs. On November 18, 2001, it broadcast a 12-hour &quot;Dexter Goes Global&quot; marathon in 96 countries and 12 languages. This marathon featured fan-selected episodes of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and culminated by premiering two new episodes of season 3.

From 2005 to 2008, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was rerun in segments on &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; with other Cartoon Cartoons from that era. From 2012 to 2014, it returned in reruns on the revived block, &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;.

From January 16, 2006, to June 7, 2021, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; aired reruns on Boomerang.

Cartoon Network has aired reruns in Canada since its launch on July 4, 2012. This launch was commemorated by parent network Teletoon, which aired Cartoon Network-related programming blocks and promotions in weeks leading up to it, including episodes of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;.

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; currently airs in reruns on Checkered Past on Adult Swim.

=== Controversial episodes ===
&quot;Dial M for Monkey: Barbequor&quot;, a season 1 episode from 1996, was removed from rotation sometime after its original premiere in the United States with no official reason given (although this has been unofficially attributed to the episode&#x27;s inclusion of a stereotypical depiction of a homosexual male character). In later broadcasts and on its Season 1 DVD (Region 1), &quot;Barbequor&quot; has been replaced with &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Lab: A Story&quot;, an episode from season 2.

&quot;Rude Removal&quot;, a season 2 episode, was produced but not aired. It involves Dexter creating a &quot;rude removal system&quot; to diminish Dee Dee and Dexter&#x27;s rudeness that instead creates highly rude clones of both siblings. &quot;Rude Removal&quot; was only shown during certain animation festivals and was never aired on television due to characters swearing, even though all swear words are censored. Tartakovsky commented that &quot;standards didn&#x27;t like it.&quot; Linda Simensky, then-vice president of original programming for Cartoon Network, said &quot;I still think it&#x27;s very funny. It probably would air better late at night.&quot; Michelle Klein-Häss of &quot;Animation World Network&quot; called the episode &quot;hilarious&quot; after viewing it at the 1998 World Animation Celebration, although she predicted that it would &quot;never be shown on television&quot;.

In October 2012, Genndy Tartakovsky was asked about &quot;Rude Removal&quot; during an AMA on Reddit, and he replied &quot;Next time I do a public appearance I&#x27;ll bring it with me!&quot; Adult Swim later asked fans on Twitter if interest still existed with it, and fan response was &quot;overwhelming&quot;. &quot;Rude Removal&quot; was finally uploaded on Adult Swim&#x27;s official YouTube account on January 22, 2013.

== Reception ==

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was Cartoon Network&#x27;s highest-rated original series in 1996 and 1997. Cartoon Network viewers voted the series as &quot;Toon of the Year&quot; in 1996. Internationally, it garnered a special mention for best script at the 1997 Cartoons on the Bay animation festival in Italy. From 1998 to 2000, a Dexter balloon was featured in Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade alongside other iconic characters, including the titular piglet from &quot;Babe&quot; whom Christine Cavanaugh voiced. The series was part of Cartoon Network&#x27;s 20% ratings surge during mid-1999. On July 7, 2000, the series was the network&#x27;s highest-rated original telecast among households (3.1), kids 2–11 (7.8), and kids 6–11 (8.4), with a delivery of almost 2 million homes. On July 31, 2001, it scored the highest household rating (2.9) and delivery (2,166,000 homes) for a Cartoon Network telecast for that year. Along with &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; expanded the network&#x27;s viewership to 72 million, and the series became one of the network&#x27;s highest-rated original series of 2002.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, particularly its first two original seasons, received critical acclaim and became one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s most successful original series. Betty Cohen, then Cartoon Network&#x27;s president, called it one of her favorite animated programs, stating, &quot;It shows little guys can be powerful.&quot; Rapper Coolio stated in an August 2002 &quot;Billboard&quot; interview that he is a fan of the series, stating, &quot;I watch a lot of cartoons because I have kids. I actually watch more cartoons than movies.&quot;

Shortly after the premiere of its first season, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was hailed as one of the best new series on Cartoon Network by Ted Cox of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. In the lead up to its second season, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was called the most imaginative series on Cartoon Network by Nancy McAlister of &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot;. Although McAlister critiqued the gender stereotyping of Dexter&#x27;s parents, she acknowledged that she was only applying such scrutiny to the series because &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; had helped convince her that &quot;viewers should take animated programming seriously&quot;.

In 1997, Bill Ward of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; named &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; to his Critic&#x27;s Choice list, recommending it for the &quot;young of all ages&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; fourth in its list of &quot;10 Best Cartoon Network Shows&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was named 72nd best animated series by &quot;IGN&quot;, whose editors remarked, &quot;Aimed at and immediately accessible to children, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was part of a new generation of animated series that played on two levels, simultaneously fun for both kids and adults.&quot; In his 2015 book &quot;Animation: A World History Volume III: Contemporary Times&quot;, Giannalberto Bendazzi called &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; &quot;visually and verbally innovative&quot;. He considered the series to be a groundbreaking work of pop art, likening its visual style to both street art and the designs of Takashi Murakami.

David Perlmutter wrote in his 2018 book, &quot;The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows&quot;, that all three segments of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; (the main scenario, along with &quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot; and &quot;The Justice Friends&quot;) elevate stereotypical ideas through an approach that contains &quot;verve and originality&quot;. Perlmutter called the series more &quot;complex&quot; than it first seems. He praised the staging of action sequences throughout the series and wrote that &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; is &quot;much more effective (and funny) than it would have been under a director less committed to the project [than Tartakovsky].&quot;

=== Legacy ===
As affirmed by Giannalberto Bendazzi in &quot;Animation: A World History Volume III&quot;, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, along with Craig McCracken&#x27;s &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, helped define the style of Cartoon Network, both for being works &quot;in which lines and colour are predominant&quot;, and for underlining their graphic aspect through limited animation. Television critic Robert Lloyd claimed that both artists were &quot;at the forefront of a second wave of innovative, creator-driven television animation, whose first wave began in the 1990s with the likes of Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; and John Kricfalusi&#x27;s &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;.&quot; Tartakovsky reflected on this period in 2024, saying that he and his colleagues took full advantage of the freedom provided by the still-new Cartoon Network, but that the level of trust on young artists was &quot;pretty much gone&quot; 30 years later.

The show has been credited for kick-starting the channel&#x27;s ascent and launching Tartakovsky&#x27;s career, which later gave way to &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot;. To this, &quot;Gizmodo&quot; contributor Beth Elderkin added: &quot;Since then, he&#x27;s become a staple in children&#x27;s and adult animation, responsible for everything from the &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; series to the powerful (and ultra-violent) &quot;Primal&quot;.&quot; &quot;Vulture&quot; called the first pilot episode &quot;a testament to Tartakovsky&#x27;s talent and commitment as a filmmaker and a proof of concept for the &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; anthology format.&quot; For a while, the show&#x27;s simplistic look was adopted by other American cartoons; in a 2021 interview with &quot;Syfy Wire&quot;, animator Butch Hartman said, &quot;When I started making &quot;Fairly OddParents&quot;, I took cues from what Genndy did in terms of simplifying the designs and using bold colors and simple shapes.&quot;

&quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; has been subject to scholarly works that include a study on post-9/11 America by Media International Australia and a publication about how Mexican children react to references in the series by &quot;Comunicar&quot;.

<doc id="99837" wikidata="Q13414750" url="?curid=99837" title="St Benet's Abbey">
<text>St Benet&#x27;s Abbey, also known as St Benet&#x27;s at Holme or St Benet Hulme, was a medieval monastery of the Order of Saint Benedict situated at Cow Holm in Horning, Norfolk, England. It lay on the River Bure within the Broads. St Benet is a medieval English version of the name of St Benedict of Nursia, hailed as the founder of western monasticism.
At the period of the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey&#x27;s possessions were in effect seized by the crown and assigned to the diocese of Norwich. Though the monastery was supposed to continue as a community, within a few years at least the monks had dispersed. Today there remain only ruins.

==The Abbey in Anglo-Saxon times==

The early history of the monastery has to be told tentatively since it is difficult to reconcile the surviving sources with what is known of the bigger picture of the development of the area. It is said that St Benet&#x27;s was founded on the site of a 9th-century monastery where the hermit Suneman was martyred by the Danes. About the end of the 10th century it was rebuilt by one Wulfric. A generation later, c. 1022, King Canute conferred on it his manors of Horning, Ludham and Neatishead.

Canute appears to have endowed at the same time another Benedictine monastery that was later Bury St Edmunds Abbey, at Beodricsworth, afterwards known as St Edmundsbury, where since the early 10th century, the relics of the martyred king, St Edmund had been venerated. With this new endowment, under the auspices of the Bishop of Elmham, the original community was reinforced or replaced by a party consisting of half of the monks of St Benet&#x27;s Abbey under Prior Uvius or Ufi. They arrived bearing half of all the furniture, books, sacred vestments and other worship items belonging to St Benet&#x27;s. Ufi became Bury&#x27;s first abbot and governed until his death in 1043. He was blessed as abbot by the Bishop of London. His successor (1044–1065) was Leofstan, another of the former St Benet&#x27;s monks.

Other early benefactors of St Benet&#x27;s included Earl Ralf II of East Anglia and Edith Swannesha, concubine to Harold II.

In 1065 St Benet&#x27;s Abbey was in good enough condition to establish a cell, later Rumburgh Priory in Suffolk. However, towards the end of the 12th century this became a dependency of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey in York. This happened by means of a gift made by the patron, who was either Stephen of Penthièvre, Count of Tréguier, Lord of Richmond or his son Alan of Penthièvre, Earl of Richmond and Cornwall.

It was the first abbot of St Benet&#x27;s Abbey, Elsinus, who procured stone to replace the wooden structure of the abbey&#x27;s church. This must have been a notable operation since suitable stone does not occur in the vicinity. The work was completed by the second abbot, Thurstan, who when he died in 1064 is reported to have been buried before the altar in the chapel of St Michael within the abbey church.
At the time of the Norman Conquest of England, King Harold Godwinson put the abbot of St Benet&#x27;s, in charge of defending the East Anglian coast against invasion. The involvement with military naval matters was naturally incumbent upon the abbot, as upon bishops and monastic superiors throughout England, in so far as he was a prominent public personage and landowner in the area and hence an integral element in the feudal system. The abbey was responsible for organizing a shipsoke or grouping of several hundreds which then had the obligation of providing a fighting ship. It is possible that the abbey did in fact provide the King Harold&#x27;s ship.

==The Abbey after the Conquest==
After the Conquest, William the Conqueror pursued those seen as having supported the defeated Harold and Abbot Aelfwold was outlawed and exiled for a time to Denmark, and the abbey&#x27;s estates suffered encroachments by neighbouring landowners and a general campaign of systematic harassment by the tenants of the upcoming Norman magnate Sir Roger Bigod, whom the Domesday Book gives as holding 187 lordships in Norfolk and another 117 in Suffolk. The harassment was to continue for a long period of time. In the reign of Henry II (1154–1189) the church at Ranworth, which was the property of the abbey, was stolen bodily, and being a timber building, was dismantled and spirited away. It took a command from the King to have it returned.

John of Oxnead (de Oxenedes), a 13th-century monk of St Benet&#x27;s, says in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; that Abbot Aelfwold was later able to return and resume his post, dying at the abbey as abbot on 14 November 1089. He was succeeded as abbot by Ralph, and Ralph in 1101 by Richard, who is credited with having completed the church&#x27;s western tower and with having hung two large bells there.
The site was not immune to natural disasters and in the 13th and 14th centuries there were incidents where violent storms on the coast forced the sea to break through the dunes, causing damage to the abbey. In 1287 to save the horses, they had to be brought from the stables to shelter on higher land in the nave of the church. The abbey also remained vulnerable to hostile incursions by water and in 1327 by royal licence the site was enclosed by a wall with battlements, isolated traces of which still survive.

Surviving records from the 12th century show that at least some of the abbey&#x27;s tenants paid their rents in kind or by means of service rendered. At Swanton Abbott the lease for a mill and a piece of land were four fat cocks a year, land at Potter Heigham was paid each year with a supply of beer for the monks, another stretch of land at Banningham was rented for eight measures of honey and a property in London for a pound of pepper and a pound of cummin, while two churches, one at Stalham and one in Norwich had to present the abbey annually with a pound of incense each.

==Abbots with connections==
That the abbey continued to have connections to the court may be shown by the fact that the man who became abbot in 1126 was Conrad, who has been identified with the monk who till then had been prior of Christ Church Cathedral Priory, Canterbury, and who had been confessor to King Henry I. Conrad is said to have brought with him two chasubles and a book that had been the property of St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, together with a chalice Dunstan himself had made. These objects were conserved at St Benet&#x27;s as relics.

Later that same century another abbot with even stronger connections to power arrived to govern St Benet&#x27;s. Hugh was an illegimitate half-brother to Cardinal William of the White Hands and to Count Henry I of Champagne who was married to Marie, elder daughter of King Louis VII of France. Hugh&#x27;s half-sister was Adela, Queen of France and he was a nephew of King Stephen of England and of the King&#x27;s brother Henry of Blois Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester.

Hugh became a knight and was wounded in battle about 1136. Cared for at Tiron Abbey in France, when he recovered he decided to become a monk there. Later he was made abbot of St Benet&#x27;s (1146-1150) thanks to his uncle King Stephen (or Henry of Blois), the appointment receiving papal confirmation in 1147. To secure this post for Hugh, the previous abbot, Daniel, was deposed.

The story in John of Oxnead&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; is that he was a capable and serious abbot but made powerful enemies who framed him by having a woman slipped into his bed and then sent armed men to punish the supposed crime by castrating him. After the violence, John of Oxnead says, Hugh&#x27;s uncle King Stephen obtained for him the post of abbot of Chertsey Abbey (1149-1163) in Surrey and at St Benet&#x27;s Abbot Daniel returned to his post. Subsequently, the death of King Stephen lead to a hostile climate in England for the family and Henry of Blois fled from England in 1155. Hugh followed, returning to Champagne and becoming once more a monk of Tiron Abbey. However, when trouble arose at Lagny Abbey, he was made abbot there (1163-1171). Though an active abbot, for some reason was deposed in 1171 and died shortly afterwards, being buried at the abbey.

==Local cults==
Despite elements of success, both material and spiritual, the abbey may have struggled to compete in religious prestige, lacking as it did the relics of an important saint. It seems that alongside a circumscribed veneration for the memory of the hermit Wulfric or Wulfey, who was said to have occupied the site before the abbey&#x27;s foundation, in the 12-13th centuries the abbey tried to promote the cult of St Margaret of Holm, supposedly a girl killed in the woods at Hoveton St John on 22 May 1170, but this made little or no progress.

==Benefactions==
The abbey&#x27;s life had substantially begun with benefactions and despite attempts both surreptitious and aggressive to snatch them away, the benefactions continued. It has been suggested that participation in 1075 of an early patron, Ralph Guader, Earl of East Anglia, in the failed Revolt of the Earls against William the Conqueror and his subsequent flight to Brittany may have caused later patrons to divert their benefactions to other monasteries. Nevertheless, benefactions there were, to the points that by the late 13th century St Benet&#x27;s had property in 76 parishes.

One of the abbey&#x27;s great benefactors was Sir John Fastolf, the inspiration for Shakespeare&#x27;s Falstaff, who died at Caister and was buried at St Benet&#x27;s in December 1459, next to his wife Millicent in a new aisle built by Fastolf himself on the south side of the abbey church. The bulk of his fortune passed to Magdalen College, Oxford, but his intention to establish a chantry at Caister Castle did not materialize.

==Later ownership==

After the Dissolution the greater part of the buildings at the site were demolished, with the exclusion of the gatehouse, which is now a Grade I listed building.

In the second half of the 18th century, a farmer built a windmill, later converted to a windpump, inside the abbey gatehouse, removing the second floor of the gatehouse in the process.

From the early 18th century, active attention was paid to drainage of the marshland around the site. From various surviving illustrations, it appears that a first windmill-powered land drainage was erected around the middle of the 18th century, and some decades later was replaced by another, attached to the front of the ruined gatehouse. By at least 1813, to facilitate movement of the windmill sails the upper floor of the gatehouse was removed to provide room for the sails to turn. The sails survived until at least 1854 but had been destroyed by 1863.

The wind-powered mechanism, which at time ceased operating and is itself now a ruin, is a grade II* listed building.

Between 1782 and 1886 just along the river from the gatehouse there was a wherryman&#x27;s riverside pub called &quot;The Chequers&quot;.

In 1925 the site became one of Britain&#x27;s first scheduled ancient monuments.

In 1993 the main part of the site was bought by the Crown Estate and in 2002 sold to the Norfolk Archaeological Trust which in 2004 purchased the gatehouse and mill from the Diocese of Norwich. The ruins of the church remain the property of the diocese, which has leased them to the Trust for 199 years. In recent years essential conservation repairs have been carried out on the ruins and visits to the site have been facilitated by the laying out of a new car park and access paths, while large numbers of volunteers undertook graffiti recording, molehill and wildlife surveys, and maintenance and provided guides. Aside from several scientific studies, the site has become the focus of intense local interest.
On 2 August 1987 a cross made from oak from the royal estate at Sandringham was erected on the high altar.

==List of Abbots==
The years listed are election dates.

==Post-Reformation Abbot, Prior and Lay Monks of St Benet-at-Holme==
During the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Vicar General was said to have noted the poverty in which the brothers of St Benet-at-Home committed to live in by contrast to the opulence of the Bishop of Norwich. It is unclear whether this was a deliberate choice to uphold principles of monastic asceticism or due to the high levels of debt the monastery was said to be in. Holding the abbey up as an example of protestant monasticism during the Reformation, Thomas Cromwell persuaded Henry VIII to spare the abbey, and unite it into the newly founded Church of England, and to elevate the Abbot of St-Benet&#x27;s to the Bishops cathedra uniting the two roles. It thus became the sole abbey spared during the dissolution, and was protected in statute by an extraordinary act of parliament in 1536. The act stipulated that the Abbot be permitted to forever maintain a Prior and twelve monks at the abbey. This makes it arguably the oldest Anglican Order of St Benedict in England. By 1545 however the abbey had collapsed and the brothers had to abandon the site. The lands were leased to a succession of local farmers to pay down the debts. As the Bishops were enrobed amongst the Lords Spiritual, the power that prior to the dissolution came with being an abbot was eroded, and successive Bishops of Norwich saw little point in using the title. However since 1939 Bishops of Norwich have once again used the title of Abbot of St Benet&#x27;s reaffirming their historic role. The Bishop in their role as Abbot appoints a local vicar as Prior of St Benet-at-Holme, who in turn appoints 12 lay monks to assist with his role. Every year on the first Sunday of August the Bishop of Norwich, in their role as Abbot, arrives at St Benet&#x27;s standing in the bow of a wherry, to meet pilgrims, and preach an annual service amongst the ruins of the abbey. The service takes place at the altar beneath the cross. The service follows an Anglican interpretation of the rule of Saint Benedict.

<text>How Hill is a hamlet on the River Ant within The Broads National Park in Ludham parish, Norfolk, England.

How Hill House, completed in 1903, was designed by Thomas Boardman, son of the architect Edward Boardman; he was Mayor of Norwich in 1905–1906. Since 1984 the house has been the home of How Hill Trust, an educational charity.

The How Hill Nature Reserve is administered by the Broads Authority.

Toad Hole Museum is a former marshman&#x27;s cottage and also houses the Broads Information Centre.

Boardman&#x27;s Windmill is a trestle or skeleton windpump, and Clayrack Drainage Mill is similar, only smaller. Just south of How Hill is Turf Fen windpump.

<text>Route 23 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey, United States. The route runs from Bloomfield Avenue (County Route 506, CR 506) and Prospect Avenue (CR 577) in Verona, Essex County, northwest to the border with New York at Montague Township in Sussex County, where the road continues to Port Jervis, New York, as CR 15. Route 23 heads through Essex and Passaic counties as a two- to four-lane surface road and becomes a six-lane freeway north of a complex interchange with U.S. Route 46 (US 46) and Interstate 80 (I-80) in Wayne. The freeway carries Route 23 north to run concurrently with US 202. Past the freeway portion, the route heads northwest along the border of Morris and Passaic counties as a four- to six-lane arterial road with a wide median at places, winding through mountainous areas and crossing the interchange with I-287 in Riverdale. The route continues northwest through Sussex County as a mostly two-lane surface road that passes through farmland and woodland as well as the communities of Franklin, Hamburg, and Sussex before reaching the New York state line, just south of an interchange with I-84 and US 6 in Port Jervis, in Montague Township near High Point State Park.

Route 23 was established in 1927 to run from Verona to the New York state line near Port Jervis, replacing pre-1927 Route 8 between Verona and Sussex. The route followed two turnpikes that were created in the early 19th century: the Newark–Pompton Turnpike and the Paterson–Hamburg Turnpike. In the mid-1950s, there were plans to build an Interstate Highway along Route 23 between I-80 and I-287, but it was never built. In the 1960s, the route was planned to be upgraded to a freeway all the way up to Port Jervis and south to Piscataway, Middlesex County; however, both freeway proposals were cancelled in the early 1970s. In the mid-1980s, the portion of Route 23 from north of US 46 in Wayne to I-287 in Riverdale was improved, with the road upgraded to a six-lane freeway south of the interchange with Alps Road and to a six-lane arterial road north of Alps Road.

==Route description==

===Essex and Passaic counties===

Route 23 begins at an intersection with Bloomfield Avenue (CR 506) and Prospect Avenue (CR 577) in Verona, heading to the north through residences and some businesses along four-lane, undivided Pompton Avenue. After a short distance, the road forms the border between Cedar Grove to the west and Verona to the east before fully entering Cedar Grove. In Cedar Grove, the route narrows to two lanes at the intersection of West Bradford Avenue/East Bradford Avenue (CR 640) before widening to four lanes again at the intersection of Grove Avenue (CR 639). Shortly before leaving Cedar Grove, Route 23 crosses the intersection of Lindsley Road (CR 604), which also heads to the west as CR 527.
The road crosses into Little Falls, Passaic County, where it narrows to two lanes and becomes Newark-Pompton Turnpike. In Little Falls, Route 23 heads through the central part of the community before crossing the Passaic River into Wayne where the road leaves the unnamed highway briefly and widens to a four lane divided highway. Route 23 passes two shopping malls, Willowbrook Mall and Wayne Towne Center, and enters the &quot;Spaghetti Bowl&quot; interchange with US 46 and I-80. Within this interchange, the route passes under NJ Transit&#x27;s Montclair-Boonton Line.

North of I-80, the road rejoins the route unnamed and becomes a six-lane freeway, featuring a cloverleaf interchange with West Belt Road that provides access to the Wayne Route 23 Transit Center along the Montclair-Boonton Line. Route 23 continues north with frontage roads serving businesses, coming to an interchange with US 202 and CR 511 Alternate (CR 511 Alt.), forming a concurrency with US 202. The road passes over a Norfolk Southern railroad line before it has an interchange with Alps Road (CR 670) and becomes a six-lane arterial road. Following this, the roadway passes west of the Mother&#x27;s Park &amp; Ride, a park and ride facility serving NJ Transit buses, and reaches an interchange with CR 683, where the Newark–Pompton Turnpike leaves Route 23 and US 202, which continue north from this point as a surface road through commercial areas. At a U-turn ramp, the eastbound direction of CR 504 follows both directions of the road, having to use the ramp in order to continue across the road. Northbound US 202 splits from Route 23, where the cut-off intersection with CR 504 is located. At this point, the westbound direction of CR 504 and the southbound direction of US 202 follow southbound Route 23 until an intersection.

===Morris and Passaic counties===
Route 23 crosses into Pequannock in Morris County and passes over the Pompton River. In Pequannock, the road is a six-lane arterial road with at-grade intersections, some controlled by jughandles, that heads through a mix of businesses and woodland. At the north end of Pequannock, the route passes over a New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYSW) branch line and intersects with CR 660, where it rejoins Route 23. The route intersects with Boulevard (CR 511 Alt.) and crosses into Riverdale, and CR 511 Alt. follows Route 23 until it heads to the north unnamed. Route 23 interchanges with I-287 and climbs a hill past the interchange, heading to the west. The route runs through Kinnelon, passing over the NYSW New Jersey Subdivision line, before entering Butler. In Butler, Route 23 passes through commercial areas, crossing the intersection with Boonton Avenue (CR 511) before heading northwest. The road drops to four lanes, still divided by a Jersey barrier. It heads under Maple Lake Road before passing through Kinnelon again. Upon leaving Kinnelon, the route enters West Milford in Passaic County at the crossing of the Pequannock River. At this point, the route enters a more wooded, mountainous setting, following the Pequannock River and the NYSW line. 
Route 23 splits, with the southbound lanes crossing over the Pequannock River into Kinnelon for a time. The route passes by the Charlotteburg Reservoir, a reservoir for the Newark public water supply, and has a rest area in the northbound direction. Route 23 intersects Union Valley Road (CR 513), running concurrently with that route. The southbound lanes cross the Pequannock River into Jefferson Township, Morris County, and CR 513 splits from Route 23 by heading south on Green Pond Road. The southbound lanes cross back into West Milford, where the two separate roads rejoin. The intersection of Clinton Road has the longest stoplight signal cycle in the United States, with drivers waiting up to five minutes and 33 seconds to cross the intersection. Route 23 continues northwest through forested areas, crossing over the railroad tracks and passing by the Oak Ridge Reservoir, another reservoir that provides water for Newark. The route crosses the Pequannock River three times, running within Jefferson Township between the first two crossings and past the third crossing.

===Sussex County===

Route 23 enters Hardyston Township, Sussex County, and comes to an intersection with CR 515. Past this intersection, the divided highway ends and Route 23 becomes a two-lane, undivided road. The road heads to the northwest through wooded mountains and runs through the community of Stockholm, where it passes east of a park and ride lot located at a church. The route curves west onto a winding road, passing over the New York, Susquehanna, and Western Railway]] line. The roadway gains a wide painted median, crossing into Franklin and meeting the intersection with Munsonhurst Road (CR 517). CR 517 heads north along with Route 23, with the wide median ending, and the road continues through residential and commercial areas of Franklin with a brief wide painted median near the intersection of Franklin Avenue (CR 631). The road crosses a stream, Mill Brook, into Hamburg, where CR 517 splits from Route 23 by heading east on Quarry Road. Route 23 continues north through wooded residential areas of Hamburg, passing under the NYSW line and crossing the intersection of Route 94. The route crosses back into Hardyston Township, heading north through a mix of farms and forests.

Route 23 crosses the Wallkill River into Wantage Township and continues north to an intersection with Glenwood Road (CR 565), running concurrently with that route and gaining a wide painted median past that intersection which eventually turns into a center left-turn lane. The road passes some businesses and becomes a two-lane divided highway before CR 565 departs from Route 23 by heading west on Lewisburg Road. Route 23 crosses into Sussex, where the route becomes a one-way pair along Hamburg Avenue northbound and Walling Avenue southbound, passing by residences. The route intersects with East Main Street (Route 284) before the northbound directions turns left onto Loomis Avenue, where CR 643 continues north on Main Street. Immediately after turning onto Loomis Avenue, CR 639 continues west on Loomis Avenue and Route 23 becomes two-way again, heading north on two-lane undivided Mill Street. The route becomes Clove Avenue before crossing back into Wantage Township.
In Wantage Township, Route 23 continues north through farmland and woodland, eventually turning west. It comes to an intersection with Colesville–Lusscroft Road (CR 519) and turns north, running concurrently with that route through forested areas until CR 519 heads north on Greenville Road. Route 23 continues northwest and heads across the Kittatinny Mountain, crossing the Appalachian Trail and entering Montague Township, Here, the road heads into heavily forested High Point State Park, which is home to the highest elevation in New Jersey. The route descends through Montague Township along a winding road, passing by some businesses immediately before heading to the New York state line. Route 23 officially ends at the state line and the road continues into Orange County, New York, as Tappen Road (CR 15) for less than . A few feet after the state line, CR 15 comes to an interchange with I-84 before it ends at an intersection with US 6 in Port Jervis. Although I-84 does not enter New Jersey, missing it by only a few feet, the signs on it for the interchange with CR 15 refer to Route 23, even though some signs erroneously refer to it as NY 23.

==History==

Route 23 follows the course of the Pompton Trail, and old Lenape trail connecting what is now Glen Ridge, New Jersey to the Minisink Village in what is now Montague. In the 19th century, two turnpikes were incorporated that would later become parts of Route 23: the Newark–Pompton Turnpike, which was built between 1806 and 1811; and the Paterson–Hamburg Turnpike, which was incorporated in 1806, and was built from Paterson to a landing in Montague Township, where the Owego and Milford Turnpike continued its route west. Parts of the Paterson–Hamburg Turnpike are now CR 650 in Sussex County, the Hamburg Turnpike from Butler to Wayne (signed CR 694, CR 689, and CR 504), Central Avenue through Haledon, and into Paterson as Broadway. Due to realignments, the current alignment of Route 23 bypasses the intersection of these two turnpikes. North of Coleville, the road was maintained by the Coleville and Carpenter&#x27;s Point Turnpike, chartered in 1850. 

In the original system of New Jersey highways, the Newark–Pompton Turnpike and Paterson–Hamburg Turnpike were combined to form pre-1927 Route 8, which ran from Montclair to the New York state line near Unionville, New York, running along the alignment of current Route 23 north to Sussex and following present-day Route 284 north of Sussex. In the 1927 New Jersey State Highway renumbering, Route 23 was designated to run from Route 9 (now CR 506) in Verona north to the New York state line near Port Jervis, replacing pre-1927 Route 8 from Verona to Sussex. In the 1930s, communities in Passaic and Morris counties were bypassed by four-lane roads, with Bloomingdale and Butler bypassed in 1933, and Pequannock by 1936.
In the 1955 plan for the Interstate Highway System, an Interstate Highway was planned along the Route 23 corridor between I-80 in Wayne and I-287 in Riverdale, also connecting to a proposed Interstate along the Route 3 corridor. However, this proposed Interstate was never built. Plans were made in the early 1960s for a Route 23 freeway running from I-80 north to I-84 in Port Jervis, New York, providing improved freeway access to northwestern New Jersey. This proposed freeway, which was to cost $120 million, was cancelled in the early 1970s due to financial troubles and feared environmental issues. A 1966 proposal called for Route 23 to be extended south as a freeway to I-287 in Piscataway in Middlesex County, running parallel to the Garden State Parkway. This $300 million freeway was added to planning maps in 1969 as Route 807 but was also cancelled in the early 1970s.

In the late 1970s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) made plans to rebuild the section of Route 23, at the time a four-lane undivided road, between I-80 and I-287 to a six-lane freeway between I-80 and Alps Road and a six-lane surface road north of Alps Road. Construction on these improvements began in 1983 and were completed in 1986. With these improvements to the route, many traffic circles were removed, including one at US 46 that was replaced with a complex interchange. In 2008, the Spaghetti Bowl interchange with I-80 and US 46 was improved, costing $70 million.

In 2010, NJDOT began plans to move Route 23 to a new alignment through Sussex. With this project, the bridge over the Papakating Creek was replaced and a new road for the southbound lanes was built as an extension of Walling Avenue, while the original Route 23 became northbound only. The project lasted from July 2012 to November 2014.

<text>Hoveton Great Broad lies within The Broads in Norfolk, England, between Wroxham Broad and Salhouse Broad.

The broad is connected to the River Bure, but not open to boat traffic. Hoveton Great Broad is part of an ancient navigation that has been deliberately allowed to become closed off to any public access since well before the last War. Recent changes in the official Ordnance Survey tide line mean that it is now tidal water and therefore closed illegally. A nature trail was laid out in 1968 - the first in the region. It is accessible only by boat. Mooring is allowed on the north bank of the Bure, opposite Salhouse Broad.

Natural England has established a Nature trail. From the boardwalk, one can see the broad with its adjoining fens and alder carr.

Hoveton Great Broad has a surface area of and an average depth of . It has a catchment area of and is about above sea level.

<doc id="99849" wikidata="Q1613300" url="?curid=99849" title="Loddon, Norfolk">
<text>Loddon is a town and civil parish in Norfolk, England, about south-east of Norwich. The town lies on the River Chet, a tributary of the River Yare within The Broads. The name &quot;Loddon&quot; is thought to mean &quot;muddy river&quot; in Celtic in reference to the Chet.

==History==
===Origins===

The earliest written mention of Loddon (Lodne) is in the will of Ælfric Modercope written in 1042 or 1043. In the will Ælfric split his land holdings in Loddon, Bergh Apton and Barton between the Bishops of Bury, Ely and St Benet of Holme. Ælfric held of land in Loddon and was by far the biggest landowner. His manor house is believed to have been close by the church overlooking the river and the fields are known as Manor Yards.

The Parish Council adopted Ælfric for Loddon&#x27;s town sign in 1961 and the bronze statue still stands on Farthing Green.

===Modern times===

Although Loddon and Chedgrave have been flooded many times through history, the worst or at least the best documented occasions were in August 1912 and September 1968.

At about midnight on 27 August 1912 a portion of the roadway was washed away and soon afterwards part of the bridge caved in. The footbridge across the river between the two industrial sites disappeared downstream. The mill was in great jeopardy and forty men worked hard to preserve as much of the road as possible. The piling and the banks of the Chet were washed away and some of the wherries broke their moorings.

On 12 September 1968 a great storm followed a very wet summer, so when the heavy rain came that night the ground was too waterlogged to let the rain drain away. According to the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; it had been Norfolk&#x27;s wettest ever September day. The torrential rain was accompanied by thunder and lightning and many roads were many inches deep in water.

==Governance==
The first tier of local government is Loddon Parish Council. The parish is within the areas of South Norfolk District Council and the Broads Authority.

==Landmarks==

Loddon has many fine buildings; from the 15th-century parish church of Holy Trinity, through the 18th-century &quot;Loddon House&quot; (originally a mental institution), to &quot;Farthing Green House&quot;, which is a good example of Georgian architecture.

===Holy Trinity Church===

The town centre of Loddon, a designated conservation area, is dominated by the Holy Trinity Church dates from 1490 by Sir James Hobart who lived at Hales Hall, and was Attorney General to King Henry VII. The outside of the building is faced with flintwork and the interior contains a hammerbeam roof, Jacobean pulpit, early Edwardian pews with carved poppy-head ends, several table-top tombs, an ancient poor-box and a panel on the painted rood screen which shows William of Norwich, a boy martyr who was falsely claimed to have been crucified by Jews in the 12th century in one of the first blood libels. There is also a medieval baptismal font set high on three steps, however despite its shaft and bowl were originally carved and painted, they were defaced during periods of iconoclasm.

The church is said to have possibly replaced an earlier Norman church and an even older one built by St Felix, Bishop of the East Angles, about 630.

===Watermill===

There was a mill mentioned at Loddon in the Domesday Book of 1086, and a watermill at Chedgrave in the early 1330s, but there is no evidence for the sites of these mills. The present mill, Loddon watermill near the town centre which is no longer functioning, was built in the 18th century with the river diverted to run underneath it. Loddon watermill was sometimes known as Chedgrave mill and is one of the earliest recorded buildings in the town. It was built of weatherboard with a pantiled roof, and was situated quite close to the centre of the town. The mill pool was never very big, but was apparently a widened and deepened Y-shaped section of river up stream of the mill. This produced adequate power for the miller to meet the needs of the local farmers and villagers. The mill still retains 19th-century milling equipment.

When the mill was built it was found that the best position for it involved diverting the river Chet to the south of its natural course. This involved considerable effort and expense and in times of severe flood the river attempts to revert to its original channel.

===Old Town Hall===
The Old Town Hall was commissioned by a private company and the petty session hearings were held in there for the first time on 10 August 1870.

==Education==
Loddon is home to three state schools: Loddon Infant and Nursery, Loddon Junior and Hobart High School, one of the few schools in the country to have a &#x27;classroom of the future&#x27;. There is also Loddon nursery school education. An independent school Langley School, lies just to the North of Loddon at Langley Park.

The first records about schooling in Loddon mention the school in what is now called the Priest&#x27;s room in the Holy Trinity Church in 1781. The 19th century saw considerable changes, including a rise in the population and consequently in the number of children. It also saw a rise in the popularity of nonconformist religions and a certain amount of competition in the provision of education for the young.

As well as the established schools there were several private schools in the town at one time or another. The 1851/61/71 census figures show a private school on the east side of Bridge Street.

By 1856 it was decided to build a new school in Loddon for 180 pupils on the site of the old guildhall on Church Plain. Two-thirds of the cost was to come from the Town Estates, which was revenue derived from the renting of Town Farm and other town lands. The rest came from public subscription and an appeal was set up to raise money from the community. The eventual result was a flint faced Gothic Revival building which is still used today as the Loddon Branch Library.

The school term started in 1858 (although the building does not appear to have been finished until 1859), when 99 children from 3–13 years old were entered. Many would not stay at school long, nor attend regularly as the need to supplement the family income when possible could not be ignored. Many children had a long walk to school, which could be impossible in bad weather. This building was used as a school until 1969.

==Industry==
Previous industries included egg packing and corn grinding. Loddon also had a gas and brick works.

Nowadays the north of the town has many boatyards situated on the River Chet. These provide yachtsmen and hire boat crews during the season and together with the boat-building and letting yards, make an important contribution to the economy of the town.

Loddon also has a small industrial area situated at the south of the town. Engineering and other industries sited on this industrial estate provide employment for local people. However, Express Plastics, one of the major employers has recently moved to Beccles. The site is to become a small housing estate. 
A famous East Anglian company Anglian Bus started in Loddon in 1986 before expansion resulted in moving to Beccles.

The Loddon and District Business Association, which was formed in 2011, represents all businesses in the area both micro and multimillion-pound industry. They work together to enhance the community life and ensure that growth increases and the facilities needed in a community of this size are met.

==Tourism==

Today the River Chet is one of the focal points for boating tourism within the southern Broads area and is the only such centre within South Norfolk District.

Further downriver still can be found Hardley Flood, a good spot for bird watching.

==Village of the Year==
In 2005, Loddon was chosen to represent Norfolk in the National Calor Village of the Year Competition.

<text>Route 24 is a freeway in New Jersey, United States, that begins at a junction with Interstate 287 (I-287) in Hanover in Morris County, passes southeast through Essex County, and ends at an interchange with I-78 in Springfield in Union County.

The route was created in 1927 to run from Phillipsburg to Newark, replacing pre-1927 Route 12 from Phillipsburg to Penwell and pre-1927 Route 5 from Morristown to Newark. The route was extended west to the new Easton–Phillipsburg Toll Bridge in 1938 but was cut back to U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in the eastern part of Phillipsburg in 1953. The western terminus was cut back further around 1970 to Hackettstown with the route west of there becoming part of Route 57. The freeway alignment of Route 24 between JFK Parkway and I-78 was completed in 1976.

With the completion of this freeway, Route 24 east of JFK Parkway became Route 124. The freeway was completed between the abandoned Triborough Road interchange and the JFK Parkway interchange in the 1970s but was not opened until 1992, when the rest of the freeway to I-287 was completed after years of legal, environmental and budgetary problems. At this time, the alignment of Route 24 between US 202 in Morristown and JFK Parkway became a western extension of Route 124 while the route was officially eliminated between Hackettstown and Morristown as it followed county-maintained routes. The former route between Hackettstown and Morristown is still referred to as Route 24 by many and is still signed as such due to local outcry.

==Route description==

Route 24 begins at an interchange with I-287 in Hanover, Morris County, heading southeast on a six-lane freeway. The route intersects Whippany Road (County Route 511 [CR 511]) with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance and crosses into Morris Township. Route 24 crosses back into Hanover Township, where it passes over Park Avenue (CR 623) and narrows to four lanes, and intersects Columbia Turnpike (CR 510) at a cloverleaf interchange near the Morristown Municipal Airport. Just past this interchange, the freeway crosses into Florham Park, heading southeast and passing through Madison before crossing back into Florham Park. Route 24 passes under Triborough Road and enters Chatham. An abandoned cloverleaf interchange exists at this location, as Triborough Road was to be an extension of Eisenhower Parkway.
Route 24 crosses into Millburn, Essex County, widens to six lanes, and passes over the Passaic River. In Millburn Township, the route intersects Route 124, JFK Parkway (CR 649), and River Road. This interchange provides access to The Mall at Short Hills. Past this interchange, Route 124 becomes a frontage road for Route 24, and the freeway forms the border between Summit in Union County and Millburn. After bisecting the Canoe Brook Country Club, the highway intersects Summit Avenue (CR 657). Route 24 continues along the Summit–Millburn border until it fully enters Millburn and intersects Hobart Avenue (CR 608) with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. Past this interchange, the Route 124 frontage road ends; Route 124 follows the freeway closely to the north as a two-way road, and Route 24 crosses into Summit before passing under NJ Transit&#x27;s Morris &amp; Essex Lines. The freeway then intersects Broad Street (CR 512) with a westbound exit and entrance and eastbound exit and Morris Avenue (CR 527) with an eastbound exit and entrance, entering Springfield. Route 24 continues southeast toward its terminus at an interchange with I-78.

==History==

Route 24 follows the course of the Great Minisink Trail, and old Lenape trail running from Minisink Village in what is now Montague Township to Navesink. In 1801, the Morris Turnpike was legislated to run along this trail from Newton through Morristown to Elizabeth. In 1806, the Washington Turnpike was legislated to run from Morristown to Philipsburg. In 1916, both of these routes were incorporated into the William Penn Highway, which diverged from the Morris Turnpike at Springfield to service Newark by the old Springfield and Newark Turnpike, and diverged north to Hackettstown via Schooley&#x27;s Mountain Road and modern-day Route 57. That same year, the state put a part of pre-1927 Route 12 (from Phillipsburg to Penwell) and part of pre-1927 Route 5 (from Morristown to Newark) on this route.

In the 1927 highway renumbering, Route 24 was created to run from Downtown Phillipsburg at the Northampton Street Bridge over the Delaware River east to Route 25 (now US 1/9) in Newark, almost completely superseding the William Penn Highway. The only diversion from that route was a proposed highway from Penwell to Long Valley, closely paralleling the Washington Turnpike. Two spurs of Route 24 numbered Route S24 were created in 1927, both of which were renumbered in the 1953 renumbering. The western Route S24 replaced the William Penn Highway and ran northeast from Penwell to Hackettstown, and is now mostly Route 57. The eastern Route S24 ran from Springfield to Elizabeth, and is now mostly Route 82. In addition, Route 24N was a planning number for the approach to the new Delaware River crossing (the Easton–Phillipsburg Toll Bridge) in Phillipsburg that opened in 1938. However, before the bridge opened, Route 24N was instead built simply as an extension of Route 24. Between 1938 and 1941, this segment was also designated as part of a rerouted US 22. In the 1953 renumbering, Route 24&#x27;s western terminus was cut back to US 22 in eastern Phillipsburg (removing the concurrency in that town) and the incomplete section of Route 24 between Penwell and Long Valley was bridged by signing the route along the former Route S24 and CR 517. Around 1970, Route 24 west of Hackettstown became part of Route 57.
Plans for the Route 24 freeway originate in 1950 when a bypass of the many congested towns along the route was planned; this bypass was designated as a freeway in 1952. In 1959, the freeway was planned on its current alignment, running from I-287 near Morristown to I-78 in Springfield, with approval in 1960. In 1962, plans were made to extend the Route 24 freeway west to US 22 in Phillipsburg. In the 1970s, this western extension was cut back to US 206 in Chester. It was put on hold in 1982, largely because its route was planned through protected wetlands and forests. In 1970, the Route 24 freeway was planned to become part of a western extension of I-278, which would have run northwest from its current terminus at US 1/9 in Linden to I-78, which it would have followed west for a mile to the Route 24 freeway. However, this proposal was rejected by the Federal Highway Administration.
Construction on the section of the Route 24 freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Essex/Morris County border and I-78 began in 1967 and was finished in 1976. With the completion of this section, the former alignment of Route 24 between JFK Parkway and the boundary between Maplewood and Irvington, including frontage roads built alongside a portion of the freeway in the Short Hills area, was designated as Route 124. The section across Chatham Borough from JFK Parkway to shortly past the still-existing unused cloverleaf interchange at the Florham Park borough line, once signed as the Triborough Road, a never-built southern extension of the Eisenhower Parkway, was built in 1973-74 but not opened as it did not provide any connections to existing roads. Plans were made to finish the rest of the freeway to I-287; however construction was halted for many years due to legal, environmental and budgetary problems. Construction finally began on this portion of freeway in 1988. Route 24 was finally completed through to the interchange with I-287 in Hanover on November 17, 1992, and at that time the Route 24 designation was limited to strictly that freeway.
Following the completion of the freeway, the former signed route of Route 24 between the intersection with US 202 in Morristown and the JFK Parkway became a western extension of Route 124. The western portion between Route 57 and Route 182 in Hackettstown and US 202 officially had the Route 24 designation removed as the road has always been county-maintained rather than state-maintained. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) has tried to remove signs from this section, but locals protested because of their familiarity with the Route 24 designation. Along this route, the road is known as CR 517 from the Morris-Warren county line to the Long Valley section of Washington Township, CR 513 from Long Valley to Chester, and CR 510 from Chester to Morristown. This route is also known as Old Route 24 along with its names and county route numbers.

<text>Route 29 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Signed north-south, it runs from an interchange with Interstate 295 (I-295) in Hamilton Township in Mercer County, where the road continues east as I-195, northwest to Route 12 (Bridge Street / Race Street) in Frenchtown, Hunterdon County. Between the southern terminus and I-295 in Ewing Township, the route is a mix of expressway and boulevard that runs along the Delaware River through Trenton. This section includes a truck-restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and Riverview Cemetery. North of I-295, Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two-lane highway. North of the South Trenton Tunnel, it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway, that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and Hunterdon County. The obsolete Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal usually stands between the river and the highway. Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely shaded due to the tree canopy. Route 29 also has a spur, Route 129, which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Trenton.

Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown Trenton northeast to Newark, following present-day Route 179 and US 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and US 22 between Somerville and Newark. The route between Lambertville and Frenchtown was originally Route 29A. In 1953, Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route 29A to avoid the concurrencies with the U.S. Routes. Route 29 between South Warren Street in Trenton and I-95 (now I-295) in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four-lane expressway, with a portion of freeway, in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1995, the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I-195/I-295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed. This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002. A realignment of Route 29 in Lambertville by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of Route 165.

==Route description==

===Mercer County===

Route 29 begins at a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-195 and I-295 in Hamilton Township, and it serves as the western continuation of I-195, heading to the northwest as a six-lane freeway. The route has an interchange with Route 129, a spur of Route 29 which connects to US 1. At this interchange, the route passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line. Route 29 narrows to four lanes past this interchange and crosses into Trenton. The route comes to a southbound exit and entrance for Lamberton Road. At this point, Route 29 becomes the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a state scenic byway that was also designated a National Scenic Byway in 2009. Route 29 runs along the bank of the Delaware River and enters a truck-restricted tunnel that passes by historic houses and Riverview Cemetery. Within this tunnel, Route 29 features a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Lalor Street. The route emerges from the tunnel and passes east of Trenton Thunder Ballpark, the home ballpark of the Trenton Thunder baseball team. The road becomes a six-lane expressway known as John Fitch Way at a traffic light at Thunder Road/Cass Street. Route 29 meets South Warren Street at another traffic light. The median widens and it becomes a six-lane freeway, passing under the Morrisville–Trenton Railroad Bridge, which carries Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor over the Delaware River.
Route 29 passes under the Trenton–Morrisville Toll Bridge, which carries US 1 over the Delaware River. Access to US 1 south is provided by ramps from Route 29 while access to Route 29 from US 1 north is provided by South Warren Street. Route 29 passes under the Lower Trenton Bridge and the median narrows again. It interchanges with Market Street, which provides access to Route 33, and then features an interchange with Memorial Drive which provides access to the New Jersey State House with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Route 29 crosses the Assunpink Creek and features an interchange which provides access to South Warren Street with exits in both directions but only a northbound entrance. Route 29 continues to a cloverleaf interchange with Calhoun Street (County Route 653, CR 653), which provides access to the Calhoun Street Bridge over the Delaware River, where it narrows to four lanes. Riverside Avenue exits as a frontage road paralleling the northbound lanes of Route 29 before the road features a northbound exit for Hermitage Avenue. Route 29 comes to a partial interchange with Parkside Avenue, with a northbound exit and southbound entrance, and then features a northbound exit for South Eastfield Avenue.

Route 29 becomes a four-lane boulevard at the intersection with Lee Avenue, where it continues northwest along the Delaware River. The route meets the southern terminus of CR 579 (Sullivan Way). The median widens again and then narrows as the route meets the southern terminus of Route 175, a former alignment of Route 29 that currently serves as a frontage road. Route 29 becomes a four-lane expressway known as Daniel Bray Highway before crossing into Ewing Township. It passes under the West Trenton Railroad Bridge, which carries CSX&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision and SEPTA&#x27;s West Trenton Line over the Delaware River. Route 29 intersects Route 175 again and then comes to a complex interchange with I-295, with the ramps within the median of Route 29, just to the east of the Scudder Falls Bridge.

Upon crossing the Delaware and Raritan Canal, Route 29 becomes a two-lane surface road known as River Road. It continues along the Delaware River, next to the Delaware and Raritan Canal, which runs between Route 29 and the river. The route intersects the northern terminus of Route 175. Farther north, Route 29 enters Hopewell Township and continues into a more rural setting shaded with trees. Route 29 heads to Washington Crossing State Park, where it intersects CR 546, which heads east on Washington Crossing-Pennington Road, and the approach to the Washington Crossing Bridge, which continues into Pennsylvania and connects to Pennsylvania Route 532 (PA 532). Route 29 continues north along the Delaware River through Titusville, passing by Washington Crossing State Park.

===Hunterdon County===

Route 29 crosses into West Amwell Township in Hunterdon County. It enters Lambertville, where Route 29 becomes a four-lane divided highway. At the intersection of South Main Street, Route 29 becomes concurrent with Route 165. The route becomes an undivided highway again and meets the western terminus of CR 518 (Brunswick Street). It meets Route 179 (Bridge Street), where Route 165 ends and Route 29 turns west for a one-block wrong-way concurrency with the two-lane, undivided Route 179, lasting to the intersection of Main Street, where Route 29 turns north on Main Street.

Route 29 follows Main Street north through Lambertville, crossing into Delaware Township. It comes to an interchange with US 202 just east of the New Hope–Lambertville Toll Bridge, with access to northbound US 202 and from southbound US 202 provided by way of Alexauken Creek Road. Route 29 continues along the Delaware River and enters Stockton. The route intersects Bridge Street, which crosses the Delaware River on the Centre Bridge–Stockton Bridge and continues into Pennsylvania as PA 263. Shortly after that intersection, Route 29 intersects the southern terminus of CR 523 (Stockton-Flemington Road). Route 29 crosses back into Delaware Township, where it meets the southern terminus of CR 519 (Kingwood-Stockton Road).
Route 29 makes a sharp left turn and heads west along the river as a rural road, crossing into Kingwood Township, where the name of the road changes from Main Street to Daniel Bray Highway. Here, it intersects with CR 651 (Byram-Kingwood Road). The route bends to the north and continues along the Delaware River for several miles, crossing into Frenchtown, where the route becomes Trenton Road. Upon entering Frenchtown, an end shield for northbound Route 29 is posted to mark the end of state maintenance, which officially ends at the Washington Street intersection, where maintenance is transferred to the county. Despite this, Route 29 officially continues farther north along Trenton Road to its northern terminus at Route 12 (Bridge Street/Race Street), a short distance east of Route 12’s western terminus at the Uhlerstown–Frenchtown Bridge. The southern terminus of CR 513 is located a block north of the northern terminus of Route 29 along Route 12.

==History==

The current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the Delaware River Drive, a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from Trenton north to the New York border in Montague Township. Route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from Trenton to Newark. The original route ran from downtown Trenton along State Street and Sanhican Drive. From there, it followed its current alignment to Lambertville, where it followed present-day Route 179 to Ringoes to present-day CR 514, which it followed to Woods Tavern. The route turned north on US 206 (also designated Route 31) and followed that route to Somerville, where it followed US 22 to Newark. The current alignment of Route 29 from Lambertville to Route 12 in Frenchtown was designated Route 29A in 1927.

The alignment of Route 29 between Ringoes and Somerville was eventually shifted to follow present-day US 202, which was also Route 30 (now Route 31) between Ringoes and Flemington and Route 12 between Flemington and Somerville. In 1938, Route 29B was planned as an extension of Route 29A from Frenchtown to Route 28 (now Route 122) in Alpha. While this road was never built, much of the alignment north of Milford is served by CR 519. In 1948, a spur route, Route S29, was created, running along US 202 (Bridge Street) in Lambertville to the New Hope–Lambertville Bridge.

In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 29 was redefined to continue north from Lambertville to Frenchtown on Route 29A, and the Route 29 designation between Lambertville and Newark was removed in favor of US 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and US 22 between Somerville and Newark. The section of former Route 29 between Route 29A and Route S29 became Route 165.

Plans for a limited-access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932, when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between Trenton and Lambertville; this proposal never materialized. Plans to construct a freeway from Hamilton Township to I-95 (now I-295) in Ewing Township were resurrected in the early 1950s. This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in Trenton to present-day I-295 in Ewing Township. From just south of Calhoun Street north to I-295, Route 29 utilized the right-of-way of what remained of the Trenton Water Power Canal, a 19th century waterway utilized by the mills of Trenton for water power. The freeway&#x27;s construction resulted in the filling of the canal, and also took up much of Trenton’s available waterfront along the Delaware River, destroying a Stacy Park, a major waterfront park, despite protests, which contributed to the population decline and economic impoverishment of Trenton over the ensuing decades. The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of Trenton and in Ewing Township became Route 175.
Between 1990 and 1995, the Route 29 freeway was built between the I-195/I-295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township. A two-lane street, Lamberton Road, connected the two freeway sections. Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton. Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the Morrisville–Trenton Railroad Bridge. The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River. The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel. The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2, 2002. A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002.

By the 2000s, the state gave the part of Route 29 (South Main Street) between Route 165 and Route 179 in Lambertville to the city, and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179. Prior to this, South Main Street had been turned one-way southbound. Route 165, which is only signed on overhead street signs, still exists, though it is fully concurrent with Route 29.
A part of Route 29 was designated in 1959 as the John Fitch Parkway, honoring inventor John Fitch, &quot;beginning with the bridge crossing over the Assunpink Creek at the conjunction of Factory Street with John Fitch Way in the city of Trenton and including the traffic circle surrounding the War Memorial building and the freeway extending in a westerly direction therefrom, along the bank of the Delaware river, to the city line of the city of Trenton...&quot; During the 1960s the War Memorial and the surrounding circle were bypassed by a realignment of Route 29 closer to the Delaware River.

In 1960, the New Jersey Legislature designated the portion of Route 29 north of Trenton as the Daniel Bray Highway to commemorate American Revolutionary War Captain Daniel Bray, a native of Kingwood Township.

In talks since the 1980s, the section of Route 29 in Trenton has been considered being redeveloped in order to connect city residents with the waterfront once again. In July 2023, Trenton was granted $1.016 million from the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission to study proposals for redevelopment of the waterfront. The main plan is to turn Route 29 into an urban boulevard, as well as build a new mixed-used community adjacent to the waterfront, which includes a few new streets. The new layout for Route 29 would veer the road slightly inland to open up the waterfront between the State House and Route 1, aligning the new boulevard with the original road along Stacy Park. Additionally, the area around Riverview Plaza is supposed to receive pedestrian and cycling improvements as a part of the new Delaware River Heritage Trail. The main area of redevelopment, which mostly consists of parking lots surrounding governmental buildings, will include various developments, including low and mid-rise mixed use residential buildings, an office building in the lot adjacent to the NJ Department of Labor building, a public square, expansion of greenery around the William Trent House, and a new parking facility. There is currently no timeframe for when construction would begin.

<text>Route 26 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States, running along Livingston Avenue from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in North Brunswick Township northeast to Nassau Street at the border of New Brunswick. Prior to the 1953 renumbering, the route continued southwest along US 1 to Trenton. Livingston Avenue inside New Brunswick, southwest of Suydam Street, is the County Route 691 (CR 691). The from Suydam Street to its end at George Street is part of Route 171, also maintained by Middlesex County.

Route 26 originates as the alignment of the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, chartered in 1803 from Warren and Green Streets in Trenton to New Brunswick. The turnpike lasted for 99 years, fighting with railroads, canals and stagecoaches to stay in business. The road was designated State Highway Route 26 in the 1927 state highway renumbering, running from the state line in Trenton to State Highway Route S-28 in New Brunswick along the turnpike and Livingston Avenue. The route remained intact, becoming part of an engineering feat meant for the safety of drivers. In 1952, the route became part of the Trenton Freeway until the Route 26 designation was truncated back to North Brunswick Township in the 1953 state highway renumbering. The route was further truncated back from Route 18 in the 1970s in New Brunswick to its current northern terminus at Nassau Street.

==Route description==
Route 26 begins at an interchange with US 1 in North Brunswick Township. The roadway heads westward as the Livingston Avenue Extension, crossing south of a pond and to the north a car dealership. Approaching the Northeast Corridor line maintained by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit, Route 26 curves to the north, crossing under US 1 and paralleling Route 91 (Jersey Avenue). Passing to the east of a railroad fork, Route 26 parallels the Northeast Corrdior tracks as Livingston Avenue, crossing through an industrial area and intersecting with the Route 26 Connector soon after. The highway continues to the west of an industrial and commercial park and continues northward, crossing the commercial district of North Brunswick. The roadway then intersects North Oaks Boulevard, which connects Route 26 and Route 1 via a residential complex.

Running northward through the commercial district, Route 26 enters a more residential region around the intersection with Jessica Lane. The highway continues northward, intersecting with Middlesex County Route 680 (How Lane) at a traffic light a short distance later. Route 26 continues northward along Livingston Avenue, passing to the east of residential homes and to the west of commercial businesses. The route enters the northernmost business area of North Brunswick, intersecting with local roads along with passing a large number of businesses. After continuing down the business strip, Route 26 intersects with 14th Street and Hermann Road at a traffic light. Hermann Road heads eastward towards the town hall and Route 171. Livingston Avenue continues northward, crossing through industrial, commercial and residential districts in rapid succession. At the intersection with 12th Street, the highway enters New Brunswick. Entering another residential district, Route 26 intersects with Nassau Street, where the state-maintenance and designation ends. Livingston Avenue, which was previously designated Route 26, continues under the designation of CR 691.

==History==
===Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike===

Route 26 followed a majority of the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, a gravel toll road envisioned in 1795 to connect Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with New York City. People raised money for the new turnpike, which was to cost $300,000 (1795 dollars) by selling 75,000 shares at $4 apiece. From there, officials would request charters from New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania for creation of the highway. Although officials in cities like New Brunswick were supportive of the plan, insufficient funds were raised and the plans eventually folded. On November 14, 1804, the plans for a turnpike went forward once again, with the New Jersey State Legislature chartered the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, a new toll road between the two cities. In Trenton, the turnpike was to begin at either Warren or Green Streets, heading along the current US 1 corridor to New Brunswick, where it would end. The new charter set a term of 99 years for the corporation. Two thousand shares of stock in the corporation were to be sold at $100 apiece (1804 dollars). Tolls for the highway would cost from half a cent to two cents a mile, as approved by the State Legislature.
On August 9, 1805, the commissioners of the turnpike met in the community of Kingston to appoint officers and to begin to lay out the new highway. Enough of the 2,000 shares had been subscribed, and the commissioners went ahead and approved a survey map created for the turnpike. By 1806, a portion of the new turnpike was opened and tolls were being collected on the new highway. On November 28, 1806, a second charter was passed in the legislature to grant fines of $20 (1806 dollars) for evading tolls or defacing property along the turnpike. In 1807, the road was completed, and Henry Gallatin, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, reported that the alignment of the long turnpike was nearly straight except for an &quot;obstruction&quot; at Sand Hills, where they had to dig into the hill to create the highway. The new turnpike was wide and had stone abutments for the new wooden bridges.

The turnpike was heavily trafficked, with several forms of transportation using it at a time. There were three tollgates along the turnpike, one at around from Trenton, one at Ridge Road and one at the current railroad crossing for US 1. Toll collectors on the turnpike would often have a hard time counting the number of horses at a tollgate because of kicked up smoke and dust. During the War of 1812, the turnpike gained record usage, moving goods between Philadelphia and New York. A third supplement was added to the charter in January 1814, where the turnpike corporation would have to upgrade the road in eighteen months or face removal of tolls. If they did not, tollgates would be removed from the turnpike. Although the corporation upgraded the route in 1827, the road was still very tough to travel for passengers and people hauling expensive goods. During the early 19th century, the turnpike was profiting from stagecoach companies, which had about six different lines winding through the turnpike. When the Delaware and Raritan Canal and Camden and Amboy Railroad were constructed during the 19th century, the profits began to dwindle and the turnpike could not handle the expenses for stagecoaches.
To cause further problems, in 1832, the New Jersey State Legislature approved the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad, a railroad to connect the two cities. A further note was made that the railroad could acquire the old turnpike for railroad right-of-way to connect Philadelphia and New York. That December, the railroad company attempted to merge the turnpike company into theirs, but faced opposition. In 1834, the turnpike company requested the choice to put another railroad on their turnpike right-of-way, but the monopoly from the Delaware and Raritan Canal and Camden and Amboy Railroad immediately opposed. Later that year, the Philadelphia and Trenton gained a controlling interest in the turnpike company, with hopes to lay the tracks on the right-of-way. The railroad company petitioned the state legislature to let them lay tracks, but the votes turned against their favor. After the Camden and Amboy commandeered control of the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad, a secret truce was made in 1835, which left the construction of a railroad to become a dead proposal, and the right-of-way remained a road. However, the turnpike was already hurting for funds, as passenger and most stagecoach traffic had moved to the Camden and Amboy Railroad. The last stagecoach line left went out of business soon after becoming the only stagecoach line along the turnpike, which cut turnpike revenues drastically.

By 1858, the turnpike had basically begun to fold, with tolls only being charged at one gate for several years as most traffic had moved to rails rather than road. That year however, there were some upgrades made to the road, but not by much. In 1867, the competitor Camden and Amboy Railroad merged with the United New Jersey Railroad to create a new company. In December 1871, that company then became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which was one of the major railroads at that point. The railroad also took over jurisdiction of the turnpike. In 1899, people from Trenton and nearby Penns Neck approached the railroad to help reconstruct the old turnpike road, but no full proposal ever came forward. By 1903, the 1804 charter had expired, and the roadway was placed under public control, but was still in a derelict condition.

===Route 26 is designated===

In 1927, about 24 years after the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike was revert to the state for future usage, the New Jersey State Highway Department designated the entire alignment from the Trenton-Morrisville Bridge in Trenton to the area around the Mile Run Brook in New Brunswick as a part of State Highway Route 26. The designation, assigned as part of the 1927 state highway renumbering covered the current alignments of most of U.S. Route 1 from Trenton (including its business loop) to where Route 26 turned onto Livingston Avenue. From there, Route 26 continued along Livingston Avenue past Nassau Street and into the city of New Brunswick, ending near an intersection with State Highway Route S-28 (George Street). Construction of the new highway continued northward, with a portion of the highway still unconstructed by June 1930, a portion near the Adams train station and part of Livingston Avenue still was not constructed to full state standards.
Route 26 along with State Highway Route 25 soon became high-use routes to get drivers from Philadelphia to New York via New Brunswick as the large high-speed roadway. In the 1927 renumbering, a connection from Route 26 to Route 25 was also assigned, bypassing to the south of New Brunswick. This route was designated as State Highway Route S-26, a route completely concurrent with U.S. Route 1. In 1931, the State Highway Department contracted plans for a new bridge over the Delaware and Raritan Canal near Bakers Basin. Although Route 26 was considered the longest straight section of highway in the state, the new freeway would get rid of a dangerous S-curve along the highway. On January 30, 1932, the State Highway Department opened the newly constructed Calhoun Street Extension to traffic. This new freeway, designated as part of Route 26, was constructed as a bypass of the business districts in Trenton and Morrisville, Pennsylvania with a new traffic circle from the Route 26 mainline (now the Brunswick Circle). Calhoun Street was realigned in the process to help make traffic flow.

In October 1935, the State Highway Department started work on moving an stretch of Route 26 over from its current alignment. The project, considered unprecedented in history, was tested in September of that year near Penns Neck to certify the feasibility of such an accomplishment. Work started in October, costing the state $400,000 (1935 dollars), including money from the Public Works Administration. The stretch of highway from Ridge Road to Adams Station Road was to be moved over to reduce the number of accidents occurring along the former alignment. In 1934 alone, accidents along Route 26 caused 90 fatalities, with a similar figure occurring until that point in 1935. By November 1936, the project had completed of the proposed conversion, an engineering feat of the time. The men who were doing this were considered &quot;experts&quot; in the jobs. By February 1939, the project had ballooned in price, reaching $842,000 (1939 dollars) and the project was still incomplete. The missing work included a new island for a median.
During the 1930s, the outcry for lighting along State Highway Routes 26 and 25 began to rise with the number of traffic accidents. Approximately 7.70% of traffic were in accidents along Route 26 at nighttime contrary to 2.42% during the daytime. Although lighting was still in testing by 1938 (with State Highway Route 24 as a test highway), Route 26 still had a high night accident rate, urging further actions for lighting the new roadway. 
During the 1940s, the Middlesex County officials designated Route 26 (Livingston Avenue) through New Brunswick as County Highway 3-R-16, but was signed as part of Route 26 to its end at State Highway Route S-28 (George Street). In 1941, the State Highway Department designated a spur along Jersey Avenue in North Brunswick and New Brunswick, which was taken over as State Highway Route 26-A, that provided direct access to State Highway Route 27 in New Brunswick. In 1947, the New Jersey State Highway Department expanded a stretch of three-lane roadway to four lanes for $500,000. This addition of new lanes was started to help safety of drivers down Route 26.

===Trenton Freeway and truncation===
During the 1950s, plans arose in Trenton to construct a new bypass of the city to the west. The bypass, to be a four-lane freeway, was designated as another portion of Route 26 when the highway was constructed in 1952. The new route also included the construction of the Trenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge, a $6.25 million (1952 dollars) span across the Delaware River. Just 30 days after the new Trenton Freeway was opened to automobile traffic, the highways were renumbered around the state. Route 26 was truncated back from the state line in Trenton to an interchange with U.S. Route 1 in North Brunswick Township, while its alignment became State Route 174 (a portion of the Trenton Freeway), U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 1 Alternate. The two suffixed spurs of Route 26 were also truncated, with State Highway Route 26-A becoming Route 91, and State Highway Route S-26 becoming only a portion of U.S. Route 1. The route, however, continued into downtown New Brunswick, where it terminated at Route 18. By the 1980s, Route 26 had been truncated back to Nassau Street. The county-maintained portion became Middlesex County Route 691 while the northernmost portion of Livingston Avenue became part of Route 171.

<text>Michael John McKean (; born October 17, 1947) is an American actor, comedian, screenwriter, composer, singer, and musician. Over his career he has received a Grammy Award as well as nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award. 

McKean started his career as Lenny Kosnowski in the ABC sitcom &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; from 1976 to 1983. He was briefly a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for its 19th and 20th seasons from 1994 to 1995, and played Gibby Fiske in HBO series &quot;Dream On&quot; (1990–1996). He has acted in films such as &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980), &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Big Picture&quot; (1989), the latter of which he also co-wrote. 

He is also known for having collaborated with Christopher Guest acting in his films such as &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984), &quot;Best in Show&quot; (2000), &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), and &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; (2006). He co-wrote the song &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (for the Guest film &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;), for which he won a Grammy Award, as well as &quot;A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow&quot; from the same film, which was nominated for the Academy Award. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2019 for his role as Chuck McGill on the AMC series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; (2015-2018; 2022). Since 2020, he has voiced Lou Pickles in Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rugrats&quot; franchise. He has acted in shows such as &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Veep&quot;, &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, &quot;Breeders&quot;, and &quot;The Diplomat&quot;. 

On stage, McKean made his Broadway debut as Edna Turnblad in the musical &quot;Hairspray&quot; (2004). He took on dual roles portraying J. Edgar Hoover and Robert Byrd in the political epic play &quot;All the Way&quot; (2014). He has acted in the Broadway plays such as the Tracy Letts play &quot;Superior Donuts&quot; (2009), the Gore Vidal revival &quot;The Best Man&quot; (2012), and the Lillian Hellman revival &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (2017).

==Early life==
McKean was born October 17, 1947, in New York City at Manhattan Women&#x27;s Hospital. He is the son of Ruth Stewart McKean, a librarian, and Gilbert S. McKean, one of the founders of Decca Records, and was raised in Sea Cliff, New York, on Long Island. McKean is of Irish, English, Scottish, and some German and Dutch descent. He graduated from North Shore High School in 1965. In early 1967, he was briefly a member of the New York City &quot;baroque pop&quot; band the Left Banke and played on the &quot;Ivy, Ivy&quot; single (B-side: &quot;And Suddenly&quot;).

==Career==
McKean began his career (as well as the characters of Lenny and Squiggy) in Pittsburgh while a student at Carnegie Mellon; David Lander was a fellow student at CMU. Their partnership grew after graduation as part of the comedy group The Credibility Gap with Harry Shearer in Los Angeles, but McKean&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1976 when he and Lander joined the cast of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; portraying Lenny and Squiggy. McKean directed one episode, and the characters became something of a phenomenon, even releasing an album as &quot;Lenny and the Squigtones&quot; in 1979, which featured a young Christopher Guest on guitar (credited as &quot;Nigel Tufnel&quot;—the name Guest would use a few years later as part of the spoof rock band Spinal Tap). &quot;Foreign Legion of Love&quot; was a big hit for the Squigtones, with frequent play on the &quot;Dr. Demento Show&quot;. McKean also played his character in an episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot;. After leaving &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; in 1982, McKean appeared in the film spoof &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot;, then two years later as David St. Hubbins in the comedy &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; with both Guest and Shearer.

McKean quickly became a recognizable name in film and television, with appearances in films such as &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980), &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), &quot;D.A.R.Y.L.&quot; (1985), &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; (1987), &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot; (1988), and taking a lead role in &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; (1988). He appeared opposite Kiefer Sutherland and Dennis Hopper in &quot;Flashback&quot; (1990). The same year, McKean was part of an ensemble cast in the television series &quot;Grand&quot;, which aired for a short time. In 1991, McKean co-wrote (with Christopher Guest) the second episode and later directed the final episode of the mock documentary series &quot;Morton &amp; Hayes&quot;, created by Phil Mishkin and Rob Reiner. McKean appeared in a number of film roles, including the film adaptation of &quot;Memoirs of an Invisible Man&quot; (1992), &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993), &quot;Airheads&quot; (1994), and &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; (1994).

Having already appeared as a musical guest and then host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, McKean joined the cast from 1994 to 1995. At age 46, he was the oldest person ever to join the &quot;SNL&quot; cast at the time (later surpassed by Leslie Jones, who joined in 2014 at age 47), one of a handful of &quot;SNL&quot; cast members who weren&#x27;t already hired to work behind the scenes (like &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s numerous writers-turned-cast members) to appear on the show before becoming a cast member and the only one to be a musical guest and a host before becoming a cast member. During this time, he also released a video follow-up to &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, played the villainous Mr. Dittmeyer in &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, and played the boss Gibby in the series &quot;Dream On&quot;. After leaving &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, McKean spent a lot of time doing children&#x27;s fare, voicing various TV shows and films. In 1997, he performed the lead voice role in the video game &quot;Zork Grand Inquisitor&quot; as Dalboz of Gurth and appeared in the 1999 films &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; and &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot;.

McKean&#x27;s television guest appearances include &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;; &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;; &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;; &quot;Friends&quot;; and &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;. McKean had a recurring role on the HBO sketch comedy series, &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot;, which he also directed. In 1998, he guest starred in a two-part episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; titled &quot;Dreamland,&quot; in which his character Morris Fletcher switched bodies with Fox Mulder. The character was a success, reappearing in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Three of a Kind,&quot; an episode which focused on the recurring characters of The Lone Gunmen. The character appeared on the short-lived spin-off series in 2001, and then returned to &quot;The X-Files&quot; in its final season for an episode called &quot;Jump the Shark.&quot;
McKean reunited with Christopher Guest in &quot;Best in Show&quot; (2000) and appeared in &quot;Little Nicky&quot; (2000), &quot;The Guru&quot; (2002), &quot;And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself&quot; (2003), and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), in which The Folksmen are played by the actors who played as Spinal Tap. McKean had a regular role as the brassy, heavily made-up bandleader Adrian Van Voorhees in Martin Short&#x27;s series &quot;Primetime Glick&quot;. He also had guest roles on such shows as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;. He did voiceover work as Henry&#x27;s cousin Louie on &quot;Oswald&quot;, which coincidentally featured the voice of David Lander as Henry. He lent his voice to an episode of Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Clerks: The Animated Series&quot; that never aired but was included on the VHS and DVD versions of the series.

In 2003, he guest-starred on &quot;Smallville&quot;, the Superman prequel in which his wife Annette O&#x27;Toole starred as Martha Kent. McKean played Perry White, who ultimately becomes Clark Kent&#x27;s boss. He previously associated with the Superman universe in 1994 on the &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; first-season episode &quot;Vatman,&quot; in which he played Dr. Fabian Leek, a cloning expert who creates a Superman clone that belonged to corporate mogul Lex Luthor (John Shea). Also, during his short stint on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, McKean played Perry White in a Superman spoof. McKean appeared in the Christopher Guest comedy &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), also co-writing several songs for the film, including the title track (with Guest and Eugene Levy), which won the Grammy for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media and &quot;A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow&quot;, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song.

McKean performed in the Broadway production of &quot;Hairspray&quot; in 2004. He co-starred as Hines in a revival of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; with Harry Connick, Jr. at the American Airlines Theatre in the first half of 2006. Also in 2006, McKean reunited with most of the cast of &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; to film the comedy &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; and appeared in the play &quot;Love Song&quot; on the stage in London. His musical interests led him to a starring role in the 2008 comedy air-drumming film &quot;Adventures of Power&quot;, in which he was reunited with Jane Lynch, his co-star from &quot;For Your Consideration&quot;, in a story intended to honor the leaders and fighters of the 99% movement.

McKean acted in the pilot episode of a remake of the British series &quot;The Thick of It&quot; as the chief of staff. The pilot was directed by Guest. McKean starred in the 40th anniversary Broadway revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, co-starring Ian McShane, Raul Esparza, Eve Best, and James Frain. The show opened on in 2007. In 2009, he starred in the Chicago-based Steppenwolf Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Superior Donuts&quot; by playwright Tracy Letts.
In 2010, McKean returned in an episode of &quot;Smallville&quot; alongside his wife and won the &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; tournament by defeating Jane Curtin and Cheech Marin. The earnings were donated to the International Myeloma Foundation in honor of McKean&#x27;s friend Lee Grayson, who died of myeloma in 2004. In Summer 2010, McKean took over the role of the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot; at the Barrow Street Playhouse in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village. In 2011, McKean appeared on an episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as a rock star looking for &quot;rocks&quot; to be in an all ROCK-band.

In 2012, McKean began performing on Broadway in Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot;. During the show&#x27;s run, he was hit by a car in New York City, suffering a broken leg. He appeared in the HBO comedy series &quot;Family Tree&quot; in 2013. In 2014, McKean played J. Edgar Hoover in Broadway previews of Robert Schenkkan&#x27;s Lyndon B. Johnson bio-play &quot;All the Way&quot;, starring Emmy winner Bryan Cranston as Lyndon B. Johnson.

In 2015, McKean began appearing as a regular cast member in the first three seasons of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; spin-off &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; in the role of the main character&#x27;s older brother Chuck McGill – a new character created for the series – also having guest appearances in the show&#x27;s fourth and sixth seasons. The same year, McKean began hosting the Cooking Channel television series &quot;&quot; This lighthearted show takes a look at food urban legends and features him both as host and narrator to some segments within each episode.

In 2018, McKean played Doug Forcett in the NBC sitcom &quot;The Good Place&quot;, a former stoner from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, who had a mushroom-induced hallucination in the 1970s and correctly guessed 92% of the afterlife. While Doug Forcett is mentioned multiple times in the show, McKean only portrayed him in one episode. McKean played Sgt. Shadwell in the 2019 television mini-series adaptation of the novel &quot;Good Omens&quot;.

<text>David L. Lander (born David Leonard Landau, June 22, 1947 – December 4, 2020) was an American actor, comedian, musician, and baseball scout. He was best known for his portrayal of Andrew &quot;Squiggy&quot; Squiggman in the ABC sitcom &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. He served as a goodwill ambassador for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

==Early life==
David Leonard Landau was born on June 22, 1947, in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest son of two Jewish schoolteacher parents, Stella (Goldman) and Saul Landau.

Lander decided to become an actor when he was 10. He studied at the High School for the Performing Arts and continued at Carnegie Tech and New York University. It was in high school he took the stage name of David Lander, which he would later legally adopt, after a classmate &quot;borrowed&quot; his real name to register with an actors&#x27; union.

==Career==
He was best known for his role as Andrew Helmut &quot;Squiggy&quot; Squiggman on the situation comedy &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; from 1976 to 1982 along with sitcom sidekick Lenny, played by Michael McKean.

Lander&#x27;s partnership with McKean began during their acting classes at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Carnegie Mellon University, where they developed the characters of Lenny and Squiggy. After Pittsburgh, they teamed up in the Los Angeles–based comedy ensemble The Credibility Gap. The duo released an album as Lenny and the Squigtones in 1979 featuring Christopher Guest on guitar, credited as Nigel Tufnel, a name Guest would later reuse in the spoof rock band Spinal Tap. Lander and McKean also appeared together in the 1979 Steven Spielberg comedy &quot;1941&quot;, and the 1980 Kurt Russell film &quot;Used Cars&quot;. They also lent their vocal talents to the children&#x27;s animated TV series &quot;Oswald&quot;, which ran for just one season from 2001 to 2003. Lander voiced the character of Henry the penguin while McKean appeared as a voice guest role for Henry&#x27;s cousin, Louie in the 17th episode &quot;Odd One Out/Goodbye, Best Friend&quot;.

Lander appeared in numerous other TV shows, including &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot; (as Squiggy), &quot;Viva Valdez&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;On the Air&quot;, &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;, and &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. His other film roles included the part of a minor league baseball radio announcer in the film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (directed by his Laverne &amp; Shirley co-star Penny Marshall) and a bit part of the minister officiating the marriage ceremony in &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot;. He also played &quot;Tanning Intruder&quot; in &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot;. Lander created the starring role of the demented fast-food franchise clown Bruce Burger in the cult film &quot;Funland&quot;, directed by Michael A. Simpson.
Lander&#x27;s voice acting roles included the &quot;dramatic reproduction&quot; of Elvis Presley quotations for the Pop Chronicles music documentary and the voice of Jerry Lewis in the Filmation series &quot;Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down&quot; in 1970. He voiced &quot;Doc Boy&quot; Arbuckle, the farm-boy brother of Jon Arbuckle, in most animated adaptations of the &quot;Garfield&quot; franchise. Later voice roles included &quot;The Big Bang&quot;, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills&quot;, &quot;Oswald&quot;, &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot; and the animated TV series &quot;Galaxy High&quot; as the six-armed Milo de Venus. In 2002, he reprised his role as Squiggy in the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Lander was the voice of Smart Ass, the chief weasel of Judge Doom&#x27;s Toon Patrol in the 1988 Disney film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. Lander reprised his role as Smart Ass on the related ride, but the character was renamed Wiseguy. He was credited as Stephen Lander in &quot;Boo, Zino &amp; the Snurks&quot;. One of his later roles was that of Ch&#x27;p in the DC Comics animated film &quot;Green Lantern: First Flight&quot;. His final credit was an episode of &quot;Goldie &amp; Bear&quot; in 2017.

He played the psychiatrist in the video for &quot;Why&#x27;s Everybody Always Pickin&#x27; on Me?&quot; by The Bloodhound Gang.

===Sports===
Lander, a Pittsburgh Pirates fan, had a small stake in the Portland Beavers. In 1997, he began work as a baseball talent scout, first for the Anaheim Angels, and later for the Seattle Mariners. He was a member of the Society for American Baseball Research, the baseball sabermetrics organization, for many years.

==Personal life==
Lander was married to Thea Markus from 1969 until the couple divorced in 1976. He married Kathy Fields in 1979. His daughter is actress Natalie Lander.

===Health===
Lander was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in 1984. He went public in 1999 and regularly spoke at related conventions. In 2002, his autobiography was published, titled &quot;Fall Down Laughing: How Squiggy Caught Multiple Sclerosis and Didn&#x27;t Tell Nobody&quot; (), written with Lee Montgomery.

Lander died of complications from multiple sclerosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on December 4, 2020. He was 73.

<text>Voting refers to the process of choosing officials or policies by casting a ballot, a document used by people to formally express their preferences. Republics and representative democracies are governments where the population chooses representatives by voting. 

The procedure for identifying the winners based on votes varies depending on both the country and the political office. Political scientists call these procedures electoral systems, while mathematicians and economists call them social choice rules. The study of these rules and what makes them good or bad is the subject of a branch of welfare economics known as social choice theory.

In smaller organizations, voting can occur in many different ways: formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations, or to choose roles for others; or informally with a spoken agreement or a gesture like a raised hand. In larger organizations, like countries, voting is generally confined to periodic elections.

== In politics ==
In a democracy, the government is elected by the people who vote in an election: a way for an electorate to &quot;elect&quot;, that is &quot;choose&quot;, from several different candidates. It is more than likely that elections will be between two opposing parties. These two will be the most established and most popular parties in the country. For example, in the US, the competition is between the Republicans and the Democrats. In an indirect democracy, &quot;voting&quot; is the method by which the person elected (in charge) represents the people, whilst making decisions. Direct democracy is the complete opposite, the people make the policy decisions directly without selecting a representative to do it for them.

A majority vote is when more than half of voters vote for the same person or party. However, whilst it is usually said each individual&#x27;s vote does count, many countries use a combination of factors to decide who has power, not the at-large &quot;popular vote&quot;. Most influential of these factors are districts that divide the electorate. For example, in the UK a party winning plurality in a majority of constituencies wins majority government, but they may not always have the most individual votes (i.e. they may have lose the popular vote but still win the seat count). (It is also possible for a party to win plurality in a minority of constituencies (but more than any other one party) and thus win minority government.)

All modern liberal democracies use voting by secret ballot to prevent individuals from becoming influenced by other people and to protect their political privacy. The objective of secret ballots is to try to achieve the most authentic outcome, without any risk of pressure, threat, or services linked to one&#x27;s vote; this way, a person is able to express their actual preferences.

Voting often takes place at a polling station but voting can also be done remotely by mail or using internet voting (such as in Estonia). Voting is voluntary in some countries, like the UK, but it may be required by law in others, such as Australia.

=== Electoral systems ===

There are many electoral methods. The purpose of an election may be to choose one person, such as a president, or a group, such as a committee or a parliament. In electing a parliament, either each of many small constituencies can elect a single representative, as in Britain; or each of a lesser number of multi-member constituencies may elect two or more representatives, as in Ireland; or multi-member districts and some single-member districts can be used; or the entire country can be treated as one &quot;at-large&quot; district, as in The Netherlands.

Different voting systems use different ballot designs. Some ballots allow only one choice to be selected (single X voting); others allow ranking or selecting multiple options (Ranked ballots).

Different voting systems allow each voter to cast a different number of votes - only one (single voting as in First-past-the-post voting, Single non-transferable voting and Single transferable voting); as many as are being elected in a multiple-member district (multiple voting as used in Plurality block voting; more than one but fewer than are being elected in a multiple-member district (Limited voting). Most allow a voter to put just one vote on each candidate, but others allow a voter&#x27;s votes to be piled on to one candidate.

Different voting systems require different levels of support to be elected. Plurality voting (First-past-the-post voting) elects the candidate with more votes than any other single candidate. It does not require the winner to achieve a voting majority, to have more than half of the total votes cast. In First-past-the-post voting, when more than two candidates run, the winner commonly has less than half of the vote, as few as 18 percent was recorded in 2014 in Toronto. In Instant-runoff voting, a candidate must have a majority of votes to be elected, although presence of exhausted votes may mean that the majority at time of final count is not majority of votes cast.

In STV, any candidate who takes quota (usually set at much less than half of the votes) is elected; others without quota (but with more votes than any other single candidate) may be declared elected as well.

Side effects of First-past-the-post voting include a waste of votes due to vote splitting, a two-party system and political polarization due to electing candidates that do not support centrism. To understand why a race using First-past-the-post voting tends to favor less-centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed &quot;up for election&quot;, and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason for the green&#x27;s lack of success is vote splitting. The three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than three-fifths of the voters prefer green. If the same number of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say, if one-third of the voters prefer green, one-third prefer blue, and one-third prefer red, then each green marble will only get one-ninth of the vote, if the green marbles each take same number of votes, while the red and blue marbles will each get one-third, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority (if the majority is split among multiple choices) will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-winner system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority, if the majority runs multiple candidates, and if the minority group runs just one candidate. This minority rule success can also result if multiple winners are elected and voters cast multiple votes (Plurality block voting). But even if the majority is split among multiple candidates, proportionate results can still be produced if votes can be transferred, as under STV, or if multiple winners are elected and each voter has just one vote.

Alternatives to First-past-the-post voting include approval voting, two-round, proportional representation, and instant-runoff voting. With approval voting, voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, so the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles. With two-round elections, the field of candidates is thinned prior to the second round of voting. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority of the votes, which is more than half. If no candidate obtains a majority in the first round, then the two candidates with the most significant plurality run again for the second round of voting. Variants exist regarding these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.

With single-round ranked voting, such as instant-runoff voting system as used in some elections in Australia and the United States, voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3,4 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the first preferences. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes are redistributed according to the voter&#x27;s nominated order of preference. The process repeats itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an exhaustive ballot but using only a single round of voting.

Ranked voting is also used in a PR format. PR-STV is used in Australia, Ireland and Malta. Quota is calculated. In say a four-seat constituency, quota (if Droop quota is used) is 20 percent of the valid vote plus 1. Every candidate with quota (of 1st preferences alone or combination of first preferences and later preferences) will be elected. If a candidate has more than a quota and seats are yet to be filled, his/her surplus will be distributed to the other candidates in proportion to all of that candidate&#x27;s 2nd preferences, in line with secondary preferences marked on the vote if any. If there are still candidates to be elected and no surplus votes to be transferred, the least-popular is eliminated, as above in AV or IRV, and the process continues until four candidates have reached a quota or are declared elected when the field of candidates is thinned to the number of remaining open seats.

In the Quota Borda System (QBS), the voters also cast their preferences, 1,2,3,4... as they wish. In the analysis, all 1st preferences are counted; all 2nd preferences are counted; after these preferences have been translated into points per the rules of a Modified Borda Count (MBC), the candidates&#x27; points are also counted. Seats are awarded to any candidates with a quota of 1st preferences; to any pair of candidates with two quotas of 1st/2nd preferences; and if seats are still to be filled, to those candidates with the highest MBC scores.

In a voting system that uses &quot;multiple votes&quot; (Plurality block voting), the voter can vote for any subset of the running candidates. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. Approval voting uses such multiple votes.

In a voting system that uses a &quot;ranked vote&quot;, the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference. For example, they might mark a preference for Bob in the first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. Ranked voting systems, such as those used in Australia and Ireland, use a ranked vote.

In a voting system that uses a &quot;scored vote&quot; (or &quot;range vote&quot;), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See cardinal voting systems.

Some &quot;multiple-winner&quot; systems such as the Single Non-Transferable Vote, SNTV, used in Afghanistan and Vanuatu give a single vote or one vote per elector per available position.

STV uses single ranked votes; block voting (Plurality-at-large voting) are often used for at-large positions such as on some city councils.

Finally, the Condorcet rule is used (sometimes) in decision-making. The voters or elected representatives cast their preferences on one, some, or all options, 1,2,3,4... as in PR-STV or QBS. In the analysis, option A is compared to option B, and if A is more popular than B, then A wins this pairing. Next, A is compared with option C, then D, and so on. Likewise, B is compared with C, D, etc. The option which wins the most pairings, (if there is one), is the Condorcet winner.--&gt;

=== Referendums ===
When the citizens of a country are invited to vote, they are participating in an election. However, people can also vote in referendums and initiatives. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organized in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in Switzerland. Australia ranked second with dozens of referendums.

Most referendums are binary. The first multi-option referendum was held in New Zealand in 1894, and most of them are conducted under a two-round system. New Zealand had a five-option referendum in 1992, while Guam had a six-option plebiscite in 1982, which also offered a blank option, in case some voters wanted to (campaign and) vote for a seventh option.

=== Proxy voting ===

Proxy voting is a form of voting in which a registered citizen who can legally vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate who will vote in his stead.

=== Anti-voting ===
In South Africa, there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens. They make the structural argument that no political party truly represents them. This resulted in the &quot;No Land! No House! No Vote!&quot; campaign, which becomes very prominent each time the country holds elections. The campaign is prominent among three of South Africa&#x27;s largest social movements: the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, Abahlali baseMjondolo, and the Landless Peoples Movement.

Other social movements in other parts of the world also have similar campaigns or non-voting preferences. These include the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and various anarchist-oriented movements.

It is possible to make a blank vote, carrying out the act of voting, which may be compulsory, without selecting any candidate or option, often as an act of protest. In some jurisdictions, there is an official none of the above option and it is counted as a valid vote. Usually, blank and null votes are counted (together or separately) but are not considered valid.

=== Voting and information ===
Modern political science has questioned whether average citizens have sufficient political knowledge to cast meaningful votes. A series of studies coming out of the University of Michigan in the 1950s and 1960s argued that many voters lack a basic understanding of current issues, the liberal–conservative ideological dimension, and the relative ideological dilemma that are important to understand when making political decisions. Studies from other institutions have suggested that the physical appearance of candidates is a criterion upon which voters base their decision. Voting advice applications can increase political knowledge enabling to cast informed votes.

=== Religious views ===
Christadelphians, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Old Order Amish, Rastafarians, the Assemblies of Yahweh, and some other religious groups, have a policy of not participating in politics and this extends to voting. Rabbis from all Jewish denominations encourage voting and some even consider it a religious obligation. The Catholic Church teaches that it is morally obligatory to vote.

==Meetings and gatherings==
Whenever several people who do not all agree need to make some decision, voting is a very common way of reaching a decision peacefully. The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or judges of the competition, may decide by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through show of hands, voice voting or audience response systems, to informal noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.

=== In deliberative assemblies ===

Some votes are carried out in person if all the people eligible to vote are present. This could be by a show of hands or keypad polling.

Deliberative assemblies—bodies that use parliamentary procedure to arrive at decisions—use several methods when voting on motions (formal proposals by a member or members of a deliberative assembly). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly can decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it.

==Voting methods==
===Paper-based methods===

The most common voting method uses paper ballots on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a write-in where they write out the name of their preferred candidate (if it is not listed).
An alternative method that is still paper-based known as ballot letters is used in Israel, where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party running in the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the ballot box. The same system is also implemented in Latvia. The system is used commonly in open lists or primary elections, where voters must choose a single party whose candidates they are allowed to choose between.

===Machine voting===
Machine voting uses voting machines, which may be manual (e.g. lever machines) or electronic.

===Online voting===
Some countries allow people to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use online voting: it was first used in their 2005 local elections.

===Postal voting===
Many countries allow postal voting, where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.

===Open ballot===
In contrast to a secret ballot, an open ballot takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the Landsgemeinde system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden, Glarus, Grisons, and Schwyz.

===Other methods===
In Gambia, voting is carried out using marbles. The method was introduced in 1965 to deal with illiteracy. Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates&#x27; photos attached to them. Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote. To avoid confusion, bicycles are banned near polling booths on election day. If the marble is left on top of the drum rather than placed in it, the vote is deemed invalid.

A similar system used in social clubs sees voters given a white ball to indicate support and a black ball to indicate opposition. This led to the coining of the term blackballing.

<text>In geometry, a hyperplane is a generalization of a two-dimensional plane in three-dimensional space to mathematical spaces of arbitrary dimension. Like a plane in space, a hyperplane is a flat hypersurface, a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of the ambient space. Two lower-dimensional examples of hyperplanes are one-dimensional lines in a plane and zero-dimensional points on a line.

Most commonly, the ambient space is -dimensional Euclidean space, in which case the hyperplanes are the -dimensional &quot;flats&quot;, each of which separates the space into two half spaces. A reflection across a hyperplane is a kind of motion (geometric transformation preserving distance between points), and the group of all motions is generated by the reflections. A convex polytope is the intersection of half-spaces.

In non-Euclidean geometry, the ambient space might be the -dimensional sphere or hyperbolic space, or more generally a pseudo-Riemannian space form, and the hyperplanes are the hypersurfaces consisting of all geodesics through a point which are perpendicular to a specific normal geodesic.

In other kinds of ambient spaces, some properties from Euclidean space are no longer relevant. For example, in affine space, there is no concept of distance, so there are no reflections or motions. In a non-orientable space such as elliptic space or projective space, there is no concept of half-planes. In greatest generality, the notion of hyperplane is meaningful in any mathematical space in which the concept of the dimension of a subspace is defined.

The difference in dimension between a subspace and its ambient space is known as its &quot;codimension&quot;. A hyperplane has codimension .

== Technical description ==
In geometry, a hyperplane of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space &quot;V&quot; is a subspace of dimension &quot;n&quot; − 1, or equivalently, of codimension 1 in &quot;V&quot;. The space &quot;V&quot; may be a Euclidean space or more generally an affine space, or a vector space or a projective space, and the notion of hyperplane varies correspondingly since the definition of subspace differs in these settings; in all cases however, any hyperplane can be given in coordinates as the solution of a single (due to the &quot;codimension 1&quot; constraint) algebraic equation of degree 1.

If &quot;V&quot; is a vector space, one distinguishes &quot;vector hyperplanes&quot; (which are linear subspaces, and therefore must pass through the origin) and &quot;affine hyperplanes&quot; (which need not pass through the origin; they can be obtained by translation of a vector hyperplane). A hyperplane in a Euclidean space separates that space into two half spaces, and defines a reflection that fixes the hyperplane and interchanges those two half spaces.

==Special types of hyperplanes==
Several specific types of hyperplanes are defined with properties that are well suited for particular purposes. Some of these specializations are described here.

=== Affine hyperplanes ===

An affine hyperplane is an affine subspace of codimension 1 in an affine space.
In Cartesian coordinates, such a hyperplane can be described with a single linear equation of the following form (where at least one of the formula_1s is non-zero and formula_2 is an arbitrary constant):

:formula_3

In the case of a real affine space, in other words when the coordinates are real numbers, this affine space separates the space into two half-spaces, which are the connected components of the complement of the hyperplane, and are given by the inequalities

:formula_4

and

:formula_5

As an example, a point is a hyperplane in 1-dimensional space, a line is a hyperplane in 2-dimensional space, and a plane is a hyperplane in 3-dimensional space. A line in 3-dimensional space is not a hyperplane, and does not separate the space into two parts (the complement of such a line is connected).

Any hyperplane of a Euclidean space has exactly two unit normal vectors: formula_6. In particular, if we consider formula_7 equipped with the conventional inner product (dot product), then one can define the affine subspace with normal vector formula_8 and origin translation formula_9 as the set of all formula_10 such that formula_11.

Affine hyperplanes are used to define decision boundaries in many machine learning algorithms such as linear-combination (oblique) decision trees, and perceptrons.

=== Vector hyperplanes ===

In a vector space, a vector hyperplane is a subspace of codimension 1, only possibly shifted from the origin by a vector, in which case it is referred to as a flat. Such a hyperplane is the solution of a single linear equation.

===Projective hyperplanes===
Projective hyperplanes, are used in projective geometry. A projective subspace is a set of points with the property that for any two points of the set, all the points on the line determined by the two points are contained in the set. Projective geometry can be viewed as affine geometry with vanishing points (points at infinity) added. An affine hyperplane together with the associated points at infinity forms a projective hyperplane. One special case of a projective hyperplane is the infinite or ideal hyperplane, which is defined with the set of all points at infinity.

In projective space, a hyperplane does not divide the space into two parts; rather, it takes two hyperplanes to separate points and divide up the space. The reason for this is that the space essentially &quot;wraps around&quot; so that both sides of a lone hyperplane are connected to each other.

==Applications==
In convex geometry, two disjoint convex sets in n-dimensional Euclidean space are separated by a hyperplane, a result called the hyperplane separation theorem.

In machine learning, hyperplanes are a key tool to create support vector machines for such tasks as computer vision and natural language processing.

The datapoint and its predicted value via a linear model is a hyperplane.

In astronomy, hyperplanes can be used to calculate shortest distance between star systems, galaxies and celestial bodies with regard of general relativity and curvature of space-time as optimized geodesic or paths influenced by gravitational fields.

== Dihedral angles ==

The dihedral angle between two non-parallel hyperplanes of a Euclidean space is the angle between the corresponding normal vectors. The product of the transformations in the two hyperplanes is a rotation whose axis is the subspace of codimension 2 obtained by intersecting the hyperplanes, and whose angle is twice the angle between the hyperplanes.

===Support hyperplanes===
A hyperplane H is called a &quot;support&quot; hyperplane of the polyhedron P if P is contained in one of the two closed half-spaces bounded by H and formula_12. The intersection of P and H is defined to be a &quot;face&quot; of the polyhedron. The theory of polyhedra and the dimension of the faces are analyzed by looking at these intersections involving hyperplanes.

<text>A tourist attraction is a place of interest that tourists visit, typically for its inherent or exhibited natural or cultural value, historical significance, natural or built beauty, offering leisure and amusement.

==Types==

Places of natural beauty such as beaches, tropical island resorts, national parks, mountains, deserts and forests, are examples of traditional tourist attractions which people may visit. Cultural tourist attractions can include historical places, sites of significant historic , monuments, ancient temples, zoos, aquaria, museums and art galleries, botanical gardens, buildings and structures (such as forts, castles, libraries, former prisons, skyscrapers, bridges), theme parks and carnivals, living history museums, public art (sculptures, statues, murals), ethnic enclave communities, historic trains and cultural events. Factory tours, industrial heritage, creative art and crafts workshops are the object of cultural niches like industrial tourism and creative tourism. Many tourist attractions are also landmarks. But sports events such as a soccer game, Formula 1 race or sailing regatta can also attract tourists.

Tourists&#x27; expectations when visiting a particular place are related to several features of the chosen destination: culture, architecture, gastronomy, infrastructure, landscape, events, shopping, etc. These features attract people to the destination and contribute to the overall experience of the trip. The ultimate primary purpose of attractions is to attract the customer&#x27;s attention so that they can come to a specific location and explore the various attractions on vacation. In the travel and tourism industry, attractions therefore play a particularly important role as this attracts tourists from all over the world.

Tourist attractions are also created to capitalize on legends such as a supposed UFO crash site near Roswell, New Mexico and the alleged Loch Ness monster sightings in Scotland. Ethnic communities may become tourist attractions, such as Chinatowns in the United States and the black British neighborhood of Brixton in London, England. Tourists also look for special local culinary experiences such as street kitchens in Asian metropolises or the coffeehouse culture in Central Europe. In particular, cultural property and the individual places of the UNESCO World Heritage Site have developed into tourist attractions. If too many tourists frequent individual places, this can lead to environmental pollution and resistance from the local population, such as in Barcelona or Venice. With regard to this whole subject, there are already lists of destinations that are not recommended to tourists.
There are innumerable lists and reviews of tourist attractions. Visitor statistics, cultural significance, beauty or age are used and these always reflect the author&#x27;s personal assessments. Sometimes it is particularly emphasized that this particular tourist attraction has not yet been in the focus of the international tourism industry. Some of the sights are internationally known or target the national or local market. Some attractions are reserved for the local population or are rarely advertised because the main traffic routes and main airports are too far away.

In the United States, owners and marketers of attractions advertise tourist attractions on billboards along the sides of highways and roadways, especially in remote areas. Tourist attractions often distribute free promotional brochures to be displayed in rest areas, information centers, fast food restaurants, and motel rooms or lobbies.

While some tourist attractions provide visitors a memorable experience for a reasonable admission charge or even for free, others may be of low quality and overprice their goods and services (such as admission, food, and souvenirs) in order to profit excessively from tourists. Such places are commonly known as tourist traps. Within cities, rides on boats and sightseeing buses are sometimes popular.

==Examples==
===Human-made attractions===
===Natural tourist attractions===
===Cultural tourist attractions===
===Novelty attractions===

Novelty attractions are oddities such as the &quot;biggest ball of twine&quot; in Cawker City, Kansas, the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota, or Carhenge in Alliance, Nebraska, where old cars serve in the place of stones in a replica of Stonehenge. Novelty attractions are not limited to the American Midwest, but are part of Midwestern culture.

==Tourist destination==

A tourist destination is a city, town, or other area that is significantly dependent on revenues from tourism, or &quot;a country, state, region, city, or town which is marketed or markets itself as a place for tourists to visit&quot;. It may contain one or more tourist attractions and possibly some &quot;tourist traps&quot;. Fátima town, for example, is a popular tourist destination in Portugal. Siem Reap town is a popular tourist destination in Cambodia, mainly owing to its proximity to the Angkor temples. The Loire valley, the third tourist destination in France, is a good example of a region marketed and branded as a place for tourists to visit, mainly known for its Châteaux of the Loire valley.

A tropical island resort is an island or archipelago that depends on tourism as its source of revenue. The Bahamas in the Caribbean, Bali in Indonesia, Phuket in Thailand, Hawaii in the United States, Fiji in the Pacific, and Santorini and Ibiza in the Mediterranean are examples of popular island resorts.

France, the United States, and Spain were the three most popular international destinations in 2017. The total number of international travelers arriving in those countries was about 234 million, contributing 8.9%, 7.7%, and 14.9%, respectively, to the total GDP of those countries.

Although some years back, Africa was lean on tourism, the continent is currently regarded as the second fastest growing tourism region with over 67 million tourists visits to Africa in 2018. Ethiopia, with a growth rate of 48.6% in 2018, is at the top of the list of African tourist centers. Other tourist locations in Africa include Cape Town, South Africa, Giza Necropolis, Egypt, The Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe and Zambia.

From the tourism industry supply perspective, a destination is usually defined by a geo-political boundary, and destination marketing is most commonly funded by governments. From the traveler perspective, a destination might be perceived quite differently.

== Economic impact and protection ==
Tourism generates substantial economic benefits for both host countries and tourists&#x27; home countries. Especially in developing countries, one of the primary motivations for a region to promote itself as a tourism destination is the expected economic benefit. According to the World Tourism Organization, 698 million people travelled to a foreign country in 2000, spending more than US$478 billion. International tourism receipts combined with passenger transport currently total more than US$575 billion – making tourism the world&#x27;s number one export earner.

Tourist attractions can:
* contribute to government revenues; direct contributions are generated by taxes on incomes from tourism employment and tourism businesses, and by direct levies on tourists, such as departure taxes
* provide employment
* support conservation of habitats, species and historic sites
* stimulate infrastructure investment
* contribute to local economies
* provide foreign currency earnings

In the event of war, many tourist attractions are a special goal in order to cause lasting damage to the enemy or to finance the war. International attempts are therefore made to protect and preserve these economic and cultural foundations of a community, city or country. There is intensive cooperation between the United Nations, UNESCO and Blue Shield International on the protection of cultural goods and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. However, cooperation between organizations and state authorities is not enough to prevent destruction, robbery and looting. The founding president of Blue Shield International Karl von Habsburg summed it up with the words: “Without the local community and without the local participants, that would be completely impossible”.

<text>In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small positive integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that possess distinct key values, and applying prefix sum on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum key value and the minimum key value, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. It is often used as a subroutine in radix sort, another sorting algorithm, which can handle larger keys more efficiently.

Counting sort is not a comparison sort; it uses key values as indexes into an array and the lower bound for comparison sorting will not apply. Bucket sort may be used in lieu of counting sort, and entails a similar time analysis. However, compared to counting sort, bucket sort requires linked lists, dynamic arrays, or a large amount of pre-allocated memory to hold the sets of items within each bucket, whereas counting sort stores a single number (the count of items) per bucket.

==Input and output assumptions==
In the most general case, the input to counting sort consists of a collection of items, each of which has a non-negative integer key whose maximum value is at most .
In some descriptions of counting sort, the input to be sorted is assumed to be more simply a sequence of integers itself, but this simplification does not accommodate many applications of counting sort. For instance, when used as a subroutine in radix sort, the keys for each call to counting sort are individual digits of larger item keys; it would not suffice to return only a sorted list of the key digits, separated from the items.

In applications such as in radix sort, a bound on the maximum key value will be known in advance, and can be assumed to be part of the input to the algorithm. However, if the value of is not already known then it may be computed, as a first step, by an additional loop over the data to determine the maximum key value.

The output is an array of the elements ordered by their keys. Because of its application to radix sorting, counting sort must be a stable sort; that is, if two elements share the same key, their relative order in the output array and their relative order in the input array should match.

==Pseudocode==
In pseudocode, the algorithm may be expressed as:

 function CountingSort(input, &quot;k&quot;)
 count ← array of &quot;k&quot; + 1 zeros
 output ← array of same length as input
 for &quot;i&quot; = 0 to length(input) - 1 do
 &quot;j&quot; = key(input[&quot;i&quot;])
 count[&quot;j&quot;] = count[&quot;j&quot;] + 1
 for &quot;i&quot; = 1 to &quot;k&quot; do
 count[&quot;i&quot;] = count[&quot;i&quot;] + count[&quot;i&quot; - 1]
 for &quot;i&quot; = length(input) - 1 down to 0 do
 &quot;j&quot; = key(input[&quot;i&quot;])
 count[&quot;j&quot;] = count[&quot;j&quot;] - 1
 output[count[&quot;j&quot;]] = input[&quot;i&quot;]
 return output

Here codice_1 is the input array to be sorted, codice_2 returns the numeric key of each item in the input array, codice_3 is an auxiliary array used first to store the numbers of items with each key, and then (after the second loop) to store the positions where items with each key should be placed,
codice_4 is the maximum value of the non-negative key values and codice_5 is the sorted output array.

In summary, the algorithm loops over the items in the first loop, computing a histogram of the number of times each key occurs within the codice_1 collection. After that in the second loop, it performs a prefix sum computation on codice_3 in order to determine, for each key, the position range where the items having that key should be placed; i.e. items of key formula_1 should be placed starting in position codice_8. Finally, in the third loop, it loops over the items of codice_1 again, but in reverse order, moving each item into its sorted position in the codice_5 array.

The relative order of items with equal keys is preserved here; i.e., this is a stable sort.

==Complexity analysis==
Because the algorithm uses only simple codice_11 loops, without recursion or subroutine calls, it is straightforward to analyze. The initialization of the count array, and the second for loop which performs a prefix sum on the count array, each iterate at most times and therefore take time. The other two for loops, and the initialization of the output array, each take time. Therefore, the time for the whole algorithm is the sum of the times for these steps, .

Because it uses arrays of length and , the total space usage of the algorithm is also . For problem instances in which the maximum key value is significantly smaller than the number of items, counting sort can be highly space-efficient, as the only storage it uses other than its input and output arrays is the Count array which uses space .

==Variant algorithms==
If each item to be sorted is itself an integer, and used as key as well, then the second and third loops of counting sort can be combined; in the second loop, instead of computing the position where items with key codice_12 should be placed in the output, simply append codice_13 copies of the number codice_12 to the output.

This algorithm may also be used to eliminate duplicate keys, by replacing the codice_15 array with a bit vector that stores a codice_16 for a key that is present in the input and a codice_17 for a key that is not present. If additionally the items are the integer keys themselves, both second and third loops can be omitted entirely and the bit vector will itself serve as output, representing the values as offsets of the non-codice_17 entries, added to the range&#x27;s lowest value. Thus the keys are sorted and the duplicates are eliminated in this variant just by being placed into the bit array.

For data in which the maximum key size is significantly smaller than the number of data items, counting sort may be parallelized by splitting the input into subarrays of approximately equal size, processing each subarray in parallel to generate a separate count array for each subarray, and then merging the count arrays. When used as part of a parallel radix sort algorithm, the key size (base of the radix representation) should be chosen to match the size of the split subarrays. The simplicity of the counting sort algorithm and its use of the easily parallelizable prefix sum primitive also make it usable in more fine-grained parallel algorithms.

As described, counting sort is not an in-place algorithm; even disregarding the count array, it needs separate input and output arrays. It is possible to modify the algorithm so that it places the items into sorted order within the same array that was given to it as the input, using only the count array as auxiliary storage; however, the modified in-place version of counting sort is not stable.

==History==
Although radix sorting itself dates back far longer,
counting sort, and its application to radix sorting, were both invented by Harold H. Seward in 1954.

<text>Christopher Nash Elliott (born May 31, 1960) is an American actor, comedian and writer known for his surreal sense of humor. He was a regular performer on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; while working as a writer there (1983–1988), created and starred in the comedy series &quot;Get a Life&quot; (1990–1992) on Fox, and wrote and starred in the film &quot;Cabin Boy&quot; (1994). His writing for &quot;Letterman&quot; won four consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards. 

His other television appearances include recurring roles on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; (2003–2005) and &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (2009–2014), and starring roles as Chris Monsanto in Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Eagleheart&quot; (2011–2014) and Roland Schitt in &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot; (2015–2020). He appeared in many films, including &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993), &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (1998), &quot;Snow Day&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Rewrite&quot; (2014).

==Early life==
Elliott was born in New York City, and is the youngest of five children of Lee (née Peppers), a model and TV director, and Bob Elliott, who was part of the comedy team Bob and Ray. He grew up on the Upper East Side. He attended the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center for a semester.

==Career==
===Letterman years===
Elliott was hired as a production assistant on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, and was with the show from its beginning in February 1982. In the middle of 1983, Elliott became a writer on the show and his on-camera appearances became more frequent. Elliott became best friends and writing partners with Matt Wickline, another &quot;Letterman&quot; crew member who was promoted to the writing staff in 1983. Wickline and Elliott pitched &quot;Late Night&quot;&#x27;s first theme show, an Emmy-winning interactive episode called &quot;The Custom-Made Show, leading the program to do a series of ambitious experimental one-off episodes. Along with the rest of the writing staff, he won four Emmys for his work on the show and was nominated for an additional six.

Elliott became known in the mid-1980s for playing an assortment of recurring quirky, oddball characters on &quot;Late Night&quot;, each of which would usually last for a few weeks to a few months, before being retired amidst much mock-fanfare on the show. Elliott and Wickline co-wrote his early pieces on the show, often about characters who had &quot;Guy&quot; in the name, including The Conspiracy Guy, The Panicky Guy, &quot;Terminator&quot; parody The Regulator Guy, &quot;The Fugitive&quot; parody &quot;The Fugitive Guy,&quot; and most famously, The Guy Under The Seats, a man who lived under the studio audience seating and would get mad at and threaten Letterman.

 In 1987, while still working at &quot;Letterman&quot;, Elliott starred in two Cinemax Comedy Experiment TV specials called &quot;FDR: A One Man Show&quot; and &quot;Action Family&quot;. He co-wrote both specials with &quot;Letterman&quot; writers Matt Wickline and Sandy Frank. &quot;FDR: A One Man Show&quot; was a fake play about the life and times of Franklin D. Roosevelt (influenced by Frank Perry&#x27;s 1984 TV movie &quot;J.F.K.: A One-Man Show&quot;). Elliott looked and sounded nothing like Roosevelt; he portrayed events from his life that never happened, such as a Japanese bombing of the White House, and his crossing the Potomac in a rowboat. By the end of the show, he had performed Gallagher&#x27;s shtick of smashing watermelons and other soft fruits on stage.

Following these specials, Elliott and Wickline had a falling-out and ceased working together, with Wickline frustrated with Elliott&#x27;s lust for stardom. Elliott switched to collaborating on his &quot;Letterman&quot; character bits with Adam Resnick, also a writer. Elliott and Resnick&#x27;s character bits found him playing self-involved show business people, both real and fake. These characters include Rip Taylor-esque Las Vegas lounge lizard Skylark, talk show host Chris Elliott Jr. (a la Morton Downey Jr.), and exaggerated surreal impressions of Marlon Brando, Jay Leno, and Marv Albert. 

As his career on &quot;Late Night&quot; blossomed, Elliott auditioned to join the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; when Lorne Michaels returned to the program in 1985. He was offered the job but turned it down to stay at &quot;Letterman&quot;. He began taking small film roles, often as a supporting actor in films such as Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Manhunter&quot; and James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;The Abyss&quot;. He had a small supporting role in an episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

===1990s===

Elliott left &quot;Late Night&quot; in early 1990 and moved to Los Angeles, though he would return as a guest interview subject many times on &quot;Late Night&quot; and Letterman&#x27;s subsequent talk show &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

In 1990, Elliott starred in his own sitcom, &quot;Get a Life&quot;, which he co-created with Adam Resnick. The show was about a 30-year-old paperboy named Chris Peterson who lived at home with his parents. Elliott&#x27;s real-life father, Bob Elliott, appeared in the show as Chris&#x27;s father. The January 1999 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; called the &quot;Zoo Animals on Wheels&quot; episode the 19th funniest TV moment of all time.

In 1993, Elliott teamed up with producer Brad Hall and directed a series of critically acclaimed short films that Elliott showed when appearing on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. That year he appeared in a prominent supporting role as Bill Murray&#x27;s cameraman in the Harold Ramis film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;.

In the early 1990s, director Tim Burton became a fan of &quot;Get A Life&quot;, and, in an attempt to re-create the success of his film &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, hired Elliott and Resnick to write a movie for Elliott to star in. The two scripted &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;, which Burton was set to direct. Burton bowed out of his role as director so he could make &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, and Resnick became &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;&#x27;s director. Although it has since garnered a cult following, &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;, which featured a short appearance by Elliott&#x27;s old boss, David Letterman, opened in 1994 to bad reviews and scant box office returns., and netted Elliott a Razzie Award for Worst New Star.

Following &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;s dismal reception, Elliott accepted an offer to join the cast of Saturday Night Live for the 1994 season and moved back to New York City. He had a &quot;terrible time&quot; on the show, finding himself to be &quot;too old,&quot; and disliking the toxic environment and late hours. The season was critically-reviled, and a &quot;New York&quot; magazine reporter who embedded with the show for four weeks wrote an infamously-scathing piece called &quot;Comedy Isn&#x27;t Funny&quot;, in which Elliott was quoted expressing his unhappiness at the show. At the end of 94-95 season, Elliott left the show amidst a major overhaul in the cast and writing team.

Following his departure from &quot;SNL&quot;, Elliott continue to appear in supporting parts in films and TV shows. He joined the ensemble cast of the NBC sitcom &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; for its third season. The show was subsequently canceled. He played Ben Stiller&#x27;s best friend in the Farrelly Brothers hit comedy &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, reinvigorating his film career.

====2000s====

Elliott began the decade with a major role as the villain in the Nickelodeon movie &quot;Snow Day&quot;. In the fall of 2000, he returned to a series regular role on television, starring alongside Steven Weber in the NBC sitcom &quot;Cursed&quot;. &quot;Cursed&quot; was given the coveted Must See TV timeslot post-&quot;Friends&quot;, but after being retooled and retitled &quot;The Weber Show&quot;, the program was canceled.

Next, Elliott played prominent supporting parts in &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; and &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;, which reunited him with Bill Murray and frequent collaborators The Farrelly Brothers. From 2003 to 2005, he had a recurring role as Robert&#x27;s strange brother-in-law Peter MacDougall in the last three seasons of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;.

Elliott spent much of the decade attempting to create another show for himself, selling a family sitcom to Fox in 2004 and one to CBS in 2006. Neither made it to air. In 2007, he starred in &quot;Chrissy: Plain &amp; Simple&quot;, a pilot for his own sketch show for Comedy Central. Elliott had a recurring role on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, playing the estranged father of character Lily Aldrin from 2009 to 2014.

====2010s-Present====

In 2011, Elliott returned to a leading role on TV for the first time since &quot;Get a Life&quot;, starring in the Adult Swim series &quot;Eagleheart&quot;. Created by Michael Koman and Andrew Weinberg and produced by Conan O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Eagleheart&quot; found Chris Elliott starring as U.S. Marshal Chris Monsanto in an exaggerated, dark version of a fake &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;-esque TV procedural. The show aired for three seasons and became a cult hit.

In 2015, Elliott became part of the ensemble cast of &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;, starring alongside Eugene Levy and Catherine O&#x27;Hara as town mayor Roland Schitt. The series ran for six seasons, winning nine Emmys, and netting Elliott a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2022, he was part of the cast of the short-lived Hulu series &quot;Maggie&quot;.

==Author==
Elliott has written four books spoofing history or pseudo-history. &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Boy: A Son&#x27;s Shocking Account of Life with a Famous Father&quot; is a comedic fictionalized biography about growing up with his famous father, spoofing Christina Crawford&#x27;s &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;. &quot;The Shroud of the Thwacker&quot; is a historical novel about Elliott&#x27;s investigation of a serial killer in 1882 New York City, spoofing London&#x27;s infamous Jack the Ripper case. &quot;Into Hot Air&quot; tells the story of Chris climbing Mount Everest with a group of celebrities tagging along to underwrite the trek as he investigates his Uncle Percy&#x27;s failed Everest expedition. And &quot;The Guy Under The Sheets&quot; is an &quot;unauthorized autobiography&quot; that tells a comedically fictional version of Elliott&#x27;s life in which Elliott &quot;reveals&quot; that he is the son not of comedian Bob Elliott, but, rather, of playwright Sam Elliott and actress Bette Davis.

==Personal life==
Elliott has been married to Paula Niedert since 1986. Niedert worked as a talent coordinator on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; when they met. They have two daughters: Abby and Bridey. Abby was a cast member of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 2008 until 2012, making her the first &quot;SNL&quot; cast member to be the child of a previous cast member. His father Bob Elliott, of the comedy duo Bob &amp; Ray, co-starred on an &quot;SNL&quot; Christmas episode in the 1978–1979 season.

<text>The University of Massachusetts Boston (stylized as UMass Boston) is a public US-based research university. It is the only public research university in Boston and the third-largest campus in the five-campus University of Massachusetts system.

UMass Boston is the third most diverse university in the United States. While a majority of UMass Boston students are Massachusetts residents, international students and students from other states make up a significant portion of the student body. It is a member of the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities and the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research spending and doctorate production&quot;.

== History ==
=== Origins (pre-1964) ===
The University of Massachusetts System dates back to the founding of Massachusetts Agricultural College under the Morrill Land-Grant Acts in 1863. Prior to the founding of UMass Boston, the Amherst campus was the only public, comprehensive university in the state. As late as the 1950s, Massachusetts ranked at or near the bottom in public funding per capita for higher education, and proposals to expand the University of Massachusetts into Boston was opposed both by faculty and administrators at the Amherst campus and by the private colleges and universities in Boston. In 1962, the 162nd Massachusetts General Court expanded the UMass System for the first time to Worcester, Massachusetts with the creation of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. In 1963, UMass President John W. Lederle informed the General Court that more than 1,200 graduates of Boston area high schools qualified to attend the University of Massachusetts were denied admission to the Amherst campus due to lack of space, and endorsed expanding the system with a commuter campus in Boston.

At the time, there were 12,000 freshman applications to the University of Massachusetts in Amherst with only 2,600 slots, yet the majority of the applicants lived in the Greater Boston area. In 1964, Massachusetts Senate Majority Leader Maurice A. Donahue and State Senator George V. Kenneally Jr. introduced a bill to establish a Boston campus for the UMass System. The bill was opposed by several private colleges and universities in the area, including Northeastern University, Boston University, and Boston College (who argued that the state would be better off subsidizing the existing private institutions in the city), as well as by Boston State College (who argued for expanding its campus on Huntington Avenue instead). However, the Huntington Avenue building of Boston State College could not be expanded to accommodate a 15,000-student campus, and the local news media and public opinion generally favored creating the new Boston campus for the UMass System.

=== 1964–1974: Park Square campus ===

In June 1964, with a $200,000 appropriation, the legislation establishing the University of Massachusetts Boston was signed into law. UMass President John W. Lederle began recruiting freshmen students, faculty, and administrative staff for the fall semester of 1965 (with goals of 1,000 students and 80 faculty members), and appointed his assistant at the Amherst campus, John W. Ryan, as UMass Boston&#x27;s first chancellor. Ryan recruited tenured faculty members from the Amherst campus to relocate and form the UMass Boston faculty, and appointed Amherst&#x27;s history professor Paul A. Gagnon and Amherst&#x27;s provost and biology professor Arthur Gentile to hire the humanities and natural science faculty members respectively.

Serving as the new university&#x27;s first provost, Gagnon became the most important faculty member in defining the curriculum and academic focus of the university, saying in June 1965 that &quot;The first aim of the University of Massachusetts at Boston must be to build a university in the ancient tradition of Western civilization.&quot; Gagnon would be the principal architect of the university&#x27;s brief attempt to create a Great Books program called the &quot;Coordinated Freshman Year English-History Program&quot;, which was dismantled by the end of the 1960s.

Freshman classes started for 1,240 undergraduate students in September 1965 at a renovated building located at 100 Arlington Street in Downtown Boston, formerly the headquarters of the Boston Gas Company (which had leased the building to the university). Virtually the entire entering class were residents of Massachusetts, with the great majority living in the Greater Boston area. By the fall of 1968, the number of applications to UMass Boston for the fall semester had risen from 2,500 for fall 1965 to 5,700, and total enrollment had risen to 3,600. In the late 1960s, UMass Boston students on average were 23 years old, typically white and male, working part- or full-time, and either married or living with others in an apartment. UMass Boston also reportedly had the largest population of Vietnam War veterans of any US university and the largest population of African American students of all universities in Massachusetts.

In February 1966, the 164th Massachusetts General Court appropriated funds for the university to purchase the building at 100 Arlington Street. Over the next three years, the university also leased the Sawyer Building on Stuart Street, the Salada Buildings on Columbus Avenue, a part of the Boston Statler Hotel for faculty and departmental office space, and the Armory of the First Corps of Cadets (which was converted into the university&#x27;s library). The student newspaper, &quot;The Mass Media&quot;, published its inaugural issue on November 16, 1966, and the Founding Day Convocation for the university was held December 10, 1966. In 1968, a group of students started the folk music radio station WUMB-FM. In the summer of 1968, inaugural Chancellor John W. Ryan resigned and was succeeded by historian Francis L. Broderick. Chancellor Broderick oversaw the reorganization of the university into separate colleges (College I and College II), along with the establishment of the College of Public and Community Service, and presided over the university&#x27;s first graduation ceremony on June 12, 1969 (where 500 of the original 1,240 students received diplomas).

By early 1967, some younger professors were holding teach-ins and encouraging their male students to burn their draft cards in protest of &quot;American corporate imperialism.&quot; The Young Socialist Alliance and the Students for a Democratic Society both had chapters on campus, and in April 1969, the latter group rallied more than a hundred students protesting the decision to move the university campus to Columbia Point. The following month, a student group called the &quot;Afro-American Society&quot;, staged an occupation of summer school registration, demanding the immediate hiring of more Black faculty members and the admission of more Black students. In March 1970, a group of thirty students occupied the chancellor&#x27;s office after a popular &quot;radical&quot; female professor in the Sociology Department was denied tenure. Following President Richard Nixon&#x27;s announcement of the Vietnam War&#x27;s Cambodian campaign on April 30, 1970, and the subsequent shooting of anti-war protestors at Kent State University on May 4, like hundreds of other universities across the United States, UMass Boston administration suspended regular business operations while the campus became consumed by protests. In 1972, Chancellor Francis L. Broderick resigned, and was succeeded by Carlo L. Golino in 1973. During Golino&#x27;s tenure before the move to Columbia Point, the university began awarding its first master&#x27;s degrees in English and mathematics.

=== 1974–1988: Columbia Point campus and BSC merger ===
On January 28, 1974, the university opened its new campus on the Columbia Point peninsula. In 1975, enabled by the move to Columbia Point, Chancellor Carlo L. Golino oversaw the opening of the College of Professional Studies (later renamed the College of Management), and in 1976, supervised the merger of College I and College II into a single College of Arts and Sciences. Golino resigned as chancellor in 1978, was succeeded in the interim by Claire Van Ummersen, and succeeded permanently in 1979 by Robert A. Corrigan. In October 1979, a dedication ceremony was held for the opening of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on a 10-acre site adjacent to the university campus.

In 1980, the 171st Massachusetts General Court voted to establish the Massachusetts Board of Regents of Higher Education with the authority to consolidate resources for public higher education in the state, and in 1981, the board decided to merge UMass Boston and Boston State College by 1984. Such a merger (including the Massachusetts College of Art and Design as well) had been proposed in the state legislature in 1963 when UMass Boston was initially founded. Though the 1981 merger had allowed both schools a three-year grace period to ease the transition, a large cut in the state&#x27;s higher education budget forced the board of regents to require a &quot;shotgun wedding&quot; merger to happen by September 1981 (although the board did allow for it to be delayed until January of the following year). Boston State College&#x27;s largest programs—its teacher&#x27;s college, nursing and police administration—transferred over to UMass Boston fully intact, and formed the basis of the College of Education, the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, and the Criminal Justice program in the Sociology Department respectively.

Despite the Boston State College students having a similar demographic profile to UMass Boston students, many students expressed opposition to the merger. Many of Boston State College&#x27;s undergraduate academic departments and programs that had equivalents at UMass Boston were disbanded, and as fewer of the Boston State faculty had PhDs than the UMass Boston faculty did, the board of regents also decided to terminate the employment of hundreds of faculty and staff at Boston State College. The merger boosted enrollment at UMass Boston by 38 percent in one year (from more than 8,000 in 60 areas of study in 1981 to more than 11,000 in 100 areas of study by 1983), and as Boston State College had more graduate programs than UMass Boston did at the time of the merger, most of Boston State College&#x27;s graduate programs made the transition and tripled the graduate student enrollment at UMass Boston. By 1995, graduate students accounted for 21 percent of the university&#x27;s total enrollment, and in 2011, the College of Nursing and Health Sciences was the ninth largest and was ranked as the 50th best undergraduate nursing program in the United States (and third best in New England) by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

In 1988, Chancellor Robert A. Corrigan resigned. Besides the opening of the Clark Athletic Center and the Boston State College merger, during his tenure, he oversaw the authorization of the university&#x27;s first PhD program (in environmental science), the opening of the John W. McCormack Institute of Public Affairs and the Urban Scholars program for talented Boston Public Schools (BPS) students in 1983, as well as the opening of the William Monroe Trotter Institute for the Study of Black Culture in 1984.

=== 1988–2007: Penney, Gora, and Collins Chancellorships ===

In 1988, historian Sherry A. Penney succeeded Robert A. Corrigan as chancellor. Her tenure was initially marred by an economic downturn in Massachusetts, to which Governor Michael Dukakis responded by ordering all state agencies to cut their budgets in the 1989, 1990, and 1991 fiscal years. In response to the budget cuts, Chancellor Penney began initiating major fundraising efforts, and despite the decline in state support, implemented multiple research programs, PhD programs, and oversaw a reorganization of the school&#x27;s colleges. In 1989, Chancellor Penney oversaw the opening of both the Urban Harbors Institute and The Mauricio Gastón Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy, and later oversaw the separation of the College of Arts and Sciences into the College of Science and Mathematics and the College of Liberal Arts. In 1990, the university launched PhD programs in clinical psychology, gerontology, and environmental biology. In 1993, the College of Public and Community Service established the Labor Resource Center and the College of Liberal Arts established the Institute for Asian American Studies, the College of Education began its partnership with The Mather School, and the Boston College Program for Women and Government moved to UMass Boston. Despite Chancellor Penney&#x27;s efforts, many programs were consolidated or closed, such as the College of Education&#x27;s undergraduate education degree.

In 1994, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education classified UMass Boston as a Master&#x27;s Comprehensive University I. By 1998, the university had four main research areas that accounted for three-quarters of the university&#x27;s research funding: Environmental Studies, Psycho-Social Functioning of At-Risk Populations, Education, and Health and Social Welfare. In 2000, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching upgraded UMass Boston&#x27;s designation to a Doctoral/Research University, Intensive, and UMass Boston now offered seven doctoral programs in public policy, computer science, nursing, and education, in addition to clinical psychology, gerontology, and environmental biology. In the 1990s, the university gained campus chapters of Alpha Lambda Delta and the Golden Key International Honour Society. Enrollment steadily increased during Chancellor Penney&#x27;s tenure to 12,482 total students and 2,866 graduate students by 2000, and the university went from one in twelve students who were minority or female in 1988 to one in three by 2000. The percentage of Black faculty rose from 13 percent in 1988 to 20 percent in 2000, and the percentage of women faculty rose from less than one-third in 1988 to 41 percent in 2000.

In 2000, Chancellor Penney resigned. She was succeeded in the interim in 2000 by David MacKenzie, and permanently in May 2001 by Jo Ann M. Gora. During Gora&#x27;s tenure, the McCormack Institute of Public Affairs became the John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies in 2003, and the PhD program in green chemistry, the first in the world, was launched under the direction of chemist and UMass Boston alumnus John Warner in 2004. Gora resigned as chancellor in 2004 and was succeeded in the interim by J. Keith Motley. During Motley&#x27;s interim tenure, the university established a partnership with the Dana–Farber/Harvard Cancer Center in 2005.

On April 2, 2004, a new Campus Center next to Wheatley Hall was opened. Construction for the facility began on July 20, 2001, and was completed during the tenure of Chancellor Gora. It became the new entrance for the campus and was the first building constructed since the Clark Athletic Center was completed in 1979. Unlike the original Columbia Point campus buildings, which were uniformly built of brick and faced inward, the Campus Center was designed such that its glass front would look out onto Boston Harbor, and the offices, food court, event space, student clubs, and activities space gave the campus a center of cohesion that was often lacking in the older buildings. In 2005, Chancellor Gora was permanently succeeded by Michael F. Collins.

=== 2007–present: Motley and Suárez-Orozco Chancellorships ===
In early 2007, Chancellor Collins resigned, and he was succeeded by J. Keith Motley, the university&#x27;s first Black chancellor. In 2007, the College of Nursing and Health Sciences began the GoKids Boston program to counter childhood obesity, and in 2008, the Graduate College of Education renamed itself the College of Education and Human Development. In 2010, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching upgraded UMass Boston&#x27;s designation a second time, now to a Doctoral/Research University with High Activity.

In 2013, the university established its School for Global Inclusion and Social Development (the first of its kind in the world), its University Honors Program as a separate Honors College, and its School for the Environment and launched an interdisciplinary Nantucket Semester Program. In 2014, research activity at the university had climbed to $60 million, and the university began work on its HarborWalk Improvements and Shoreline Stabilization project. By the fall semester of 2014, total student enrollment had grown to 16,756 with 4,056 graduate students. The number of doctoral students had increased from 230 in the fall of 2000 to 614 in the fall of 2014.

In 2014, UMass Boston celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, and in 2015, the University of Massachusetts Press published the school&#x27;s first history about its founding and growth, entitled &quot;UMass Boston at 50&quot;. In 2015, the College of Management enrolled close to one-sixth of all students and more than half of the undergraduate students earning degrees in a STEM field were minority or female. By 2015, UMass Boston students came from 140 different nations and spoke 90 different languages. On January 26, 2015, the university opened its first new academic building since the Columbia Point campus was built, a research facility named the Integrated Sciences Complex. On March 30, 2015, the dedication ceremony for the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate was held. On January 25, 2016, the university began a phased opening of its second new academic facility, University Hall. In September 2016, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UMass Boston within the first tier of national universities on its Best Colleges Ranking for the first time in the university&#x27;s history, tied at number 220.

On March 3, 2017, Barry Mills was appointed the university&#x27;s deputy chancellor and chief operating officer. On April 5, 2017, university officials announced that Chancellor J. Keith Motley would resign at the end of the academic calendar year. UMass System President Marty Meehan stated Deputy Chancellor Mills would serve as interim chancellor &quot;until [university] finances are stabilized and the university is positioned to attract a world-class chancellor through a global search&quot;, specifically to address the university&#x27;s 2017 operating budget deficit of $30 million. UMass Boston faculty publicly expressed concern that Motley was being scapegoated for the university&#x27;s budget deficit while Boston City Councilors Tito Jackson and Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts State Senator Linda Dorcena Forry, and Massachusetts State Representative Russell Holmes called upon System President Meehan to reject Motley&#x27;s resignation.

On April 8, 2017, at a UMass System Board of Trustees meeting, UMass Boston faculty and students protested decisions by university administration to cut offerings of courses (many required for graduation) in the upcoming summer semester, as well as other programs and to make expense adjustments which reduced the deficit to approximately $6 million or $7 million. On July 1, 2017, Barry Mills became interim chancellor after Keith Motley&#x27;s resignation. A coalition of UMass Boston administrative staff, faculty, and students formed (called the &quot;Coalition to Save UMB&quot;) and issued a report authored by faculty calling on Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker and the Massachusetts General Court to increase state funding to assist the university to service its debt from its campus renewal construction projects and increase capital investments for the university.

In November 2017, an audit commissioned by UMass System President Marty Meehan found that faulty record keeping, a lack of discipline in its budgeting process, and a failure on the part of UMass Boston administration to appreciate the cost of the campus renewal construction projects on the university&#x27;s operating budget led to the university&#x27;s $30 million budget deficit, and in the same month, the university laid off 36 employees after laying off about 100 non-tenure track faculty earlier in the year. In April 2018, University of Massachusetts Amherst and Mount Ida College administrators announced that the former school would acquire the latter&#x27;s campus in Newton after the latter college&#x27;s closure. The acquisition was immediately opposed by UMass Boston faculty and students due to inadequate consultation with the Boston campus faculty, the Boston campus&#x27; budget deficit, and that because of the proximity of the Mount Ida campus to the Boston campus, the faculty contended that the new campus would compete with the Boston campus. As of April 2018, the UMass Boston campus remained the sole campus in the UMass system with a majority-minority enrollment.

In May 2018, following the approval of the sale by the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, the UMass Boston Faculty Council passed a motion of no confidence in UMass System President Marty Meehan and the UMass System Board of Trustees. Ten days after three finalists for the UMass Boston chancellor position were named, on May 21, 2018, all three finalists withdrew from consideration after faculty members questioned the qualifications of the candidates. On June 20, 2018, UMass System Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Katherine Newman was appointed as the university&#x27;s interim chancellor. In September 2018, students moved into UMass Boston&#x27;s first dormitory, and the university opened the free-standing parking garage adjacent to the Integrated Sciences Complex.

In February 2019, university campus employees protested an administration decision to increase the daily parking fee from $6 to $15 to cover the costs of the garage operation and other expenses. During the 2018–2019 academic year, UMass Boston was ranked by multiple publications as being among the best universities in the United States for veteran students. In May 2019, the Pioneer Institute released a white paper co-authored by former Massachusetts State Representative Gregory W. Sullivan that concluded that Chancellor Keith Motley and other UMass Boston administrators were scapegoated for the 2017 fiscal year $30 million budget deficit and that instead the approval by the System Board of Trustees of an accelerated 5-year capital spending plan in December 2014 and an error to a 5-year campus reserve ratio estimate were the cause of the $26 million in budget reductions implemented by interim Chancellor Barry Mills and that the reductions were made at the direction of the UMass Central Office.

Additionally, the white paper states that the 2017 audit was not conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards or reported in accordance with auditing standards, and that the purchase of Mount Ida College in April 2018 was conducted by a wire transfer from the UMass System for $75 million without being included on the previously approved university capital plan at the time the UMass Central Office ordered the budget reductions rather than UMass Amherst purchasing the Mount Ida campus with loanable funds to be repaid with interest. The following month, interim Chancellor Katherine Newman issued a press statement disputing the findings of the white paper. In September 2019, the UMass Boston Faculty Staff Union President addressed the UMass System Board of Trustees to protest the potential offering of equivalent programs at the Mount Ida campus that are already offered at the Boston campus. The following December, the UMass Boston Faculty Staff Union President presented the board with a petition from the Boston campus faculty reiterating their concerns about the Mount Ida campus and requesting more input into its planning.

In February 2020, Marcelo Suárez-Orozco was unanimously appointed as the new permanent chancellor of the university. In September 2021, the UMass System Board of Trustees Chair announced that a $15 million endowment would be established for the UMass Boston College of Nursing and Health Sciences as part of a $50 million personal donation to the UMass System (the largest in its history) by the System Board of Trustees Chair and his wife. In January 2023, the Manning College of Nursing and Health Sciences received $3 million in federal funding for a home care digital and simulation lab. In July 2023, UMass Boston and Mass General Brigham announced an agreement to provide $20 million in funding for a workforce pipeline program in the Manning College of Nursing and Health Sciences. In December 2023, New Balance announced a $10 million grant to expand a sports leadership program at the university into a full institute on the campus that the company provided a $5 million grant to create in 2018. Pursuant to a report issued by the Boston Public Health Commission, Chancellor Suárez-Orozco and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu announced a $2.5 million partnership between the university and the Boston Public Schools in March 2024 to create a behavioral health training program to place 263 UMass Boston students in district schools and create a workforce pipeline for BPS students seeking behavioral health careers. In September 2024, university administration announced a new admissions and transfer program in partnership with Bunker Hill Community College.

===1960s campus siting controversy===

Where UMass Boston would locate its campus permanently was a contentious dispute during the university&#x27;s early history in the 1960s. The conflict emerged in 1965, not long after the university was initially founded: UMass President John W. Lederle had insisted upon a campus inside the city limits of Boston, while Boston Mayor John F. Collins publicly asked Chancellor John W. Ryan not to consider a permanent site in Downtown Boston, as a disproportionate amount of the valuable real estate there was already owned by many colleges and other non-profit institutions exempt from the city government&#x27;s property taxes. In 1954, only one new private office building had appeared on the city skyline since 1929, one in five of the city&#x27;s housing units were classified as dilapidated or deteriorating and the city was ranked lowest among major cities in building starts, while the only growing industries in the city were government and universities (leading to a narrowing tax base) and the city already had a higher number of municipal employees per capita than any major city in the United States.

In addition to Mayor Collins, the Boston business community, the Massachusetts General Court, WBZ radio, the editorial board of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and residents of the South End were also opposed to a permanent downtown campus. Nonetheless, when the university purchased the building at 100 Arlington Street in 1966, many faculty and students interpreted the transaction as a signal that the university intended to settle permanently in Park Square. A proposal popular among students and faculty to build a high-rise academic building overlooking the Massachusetts Turnpike in Copley Square was cancelled when the John Hancock Insurance Company purchased the land and built John Hancock Tower there instead. Another proposal for a campus in the Highland Park area of Roxbury also met with opposition from residents. Other proposals to locate the permanent campus near Fenway Park, or South Station and Chinatown, or on golf courses for sale in Newton, were considered but rejected by Chancellor Ryan due to insufficient space or commuting concerns.

In 1967, the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) published a study, titled &quot;An Urban Campus by the Sea&quot;, which proposed building the campus on the Columbia Point peninsula. The site was a former landfill, adjacent to the largest and poorest public housing complex in New England, and a mile from the MBTA&#x27;s Columbia station. The proposal was deeply unpopular among the faculty and students; 1,500 of them subsequently organized a rally in November 1967 on Boston Common demanding a downtown location in Copley Square. In April 1969, when the Students for a Democratic Society organized its opposition rally, the student leaders denounced the university as &quot;a &#x27;pawn&#x27; masking the Boston Redevelopment Authority&#x27;s plan to remove poor people from Columbia Point&quot; and that &quot;the university is planning a prestigious dormitory school with high tuition which students from low- and moderate-income families–whom the university was designed to serve–will not be able to attend.&quot;

Chancellor Ryan also opposed the Columbia Point proposal, who before he resigned in February 1968, made a counterproposal for a 15-acre campus south of where John Hancock Tower was being built that the BRA rejected. Architectural consultants of the university also scouted land near North Station and adjacent to the Boston Garden that was immediately opposed both by the ownership of the Boston Garden-Arena Corporation that owned the Boston Bruins (who threatened to move the team out of the city) and Boston Mayor Kevin White. In August 1968, after Francis L. Broderick was appointed the university&#x27;s chancellor, now Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Robert H. Quinn, Massachusetts Senate Majority Leader Kevin B. Harrington, and State Senator George Kenneally all urged the UMass Board of Trustees to accept the Columbia Point proposal, while Chancellor Broderick asked the board to delay its decision at an October 1968 meeting by one month so that he might be able to deliver a final counterproposal (while another rally at the Massachusetts State House of 2,500 faculty and students still demanded a Copley Square or Park Square location).

In November 1968, Chancellor Broderick proposed a scattered-site campus of office buildings situated along the MBTA&#x27;s Green Line in the South End that would be jointly owned by the university and businesses while retaining the original Arlington Street building. However, while the UMass Board of Trustees and UMass President John W. Lederle argued instead for a unified campus on Columbia Point, they allowed a task force an additional month to more fully study Broderick&#x27;s proposal. In the end, after reviewing the task force&#x27;s white paper at a meeting in December 1968, the UMass Board of Trustees voted 12 to 4 to accept the Columbia Point proposal.

===Initial construction and MBM scandal===
Beginning in 1970, the construction of the Columbia Point campus was the largest public capital construction project in the history of Massachusetts (exceeded only later by the Big Dig). The state government hired a single construction management firm, McKee-Berger-Mansueto (MBM), to supervise six other architectural firms and construction companies to complete the project by September 1973. The construction had multiple delays: the Boston Edison Company had not finished its electrical work, and because the site was a former landfill (that had only been closed since 1963), a concrete and brick substructure (where all of the campus mechanical systems would run conduits) undergirded by hundreds of driven piles needed to be constructed before the buildings, but pile driving released methane from the former landfill, requiring construction workers to halt production while each release of methane dispersed.

The Columbia Point campus was originally composed of five buildings connected by a series of skyways on the second floors of the buildings: McCormack Hall, Wheatley Hall, the Science Center, the Healey Library (which was designed by Chicago modernist architect Harry Weese), and the Quinn Administration Building. To transport students from Columbia station, the MBTA concluded that constructing a skyway from the station to the campus would be too expensive, and the university administration set about planning a shuttle bus system, funded by parking fees. Campus facilities would rise from the bottom of the substructure and the bottom of the substructure would provide entry to a parking garage with 1,600 spaces. Because the campus was surrounded on three sides by a bay, exposed to sea breeze and winter storms, the salt water in the atmosphere and the road salt carried from automobiles would eventually damage parts of the substructure beyond feasible and cost-effective repair.

Because the university was underneath flight paths arriving at Logan International Airport, all of the original Columbia Point campus buildings were soundproofed, and because of this, the classroom and offices in the buildings were designed as interior spaces with no windows, and the entrance to every building faced inward onto the campus plaza. Due to the campus being uniformly built of brick and the campus positioned above the landscape, the campus became known as &quot;The Fortress&quot;, &quot;The Rock&quot;, or &quot;The Prison&quot; colloquially. The buildings were rumored to have been designed by architects familiar with the architectural design of prisons (such as Weese, who designed the Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center), but also designed so that the plaza could easily be occupied by the National Guard to suppress demonstrations and protests. In 1974, the $350 million capital construction budget for erecting more buildings on the campus was frozen due to the 1973–1975 recession, halting any further expansion of the campus. Construction for the Clark Athletic Center (that included an ice hockey arena, swimming pool, and basketball courts) broke ground in 1978 and was completed in 1979.

In 1977, McKee-Berger-Mansueto, Inc. (MBM), the company contracted to supervise the construction of the campus, came under public scrutiny after its contract with the Commonwealth was criticized in a series of newspaper articles for being abnormally favorable towards MBM, and a special legislative committee (led by Amherst College President John William Ward) was formed to investigate the contract. A scandal erupted after it was learned MBM paid Massachusetts Senate Majority Leader Joseph DiCarlo and State Senator Ronald MacKenzie $40,000 in exchange for a favorable report from the committee. DiCarlo and MacKenzie were convicted of extortion. Newspaper columnist Charles Pierce summarized the careless and negligent quality of MBM&#x27;s construction projects unearthed by the Ward Commission&#x27;s investigation as follows:

Besides the Worcester jail with the cells that did not lock, there was the auditorium at Boston State College in which the stage was not visible from a third of the seats and the library at Salem State College in which the walls were not sturdy enough to bear the weight of the books. At the UMass-Boston campus, ground zero of the scandal, school officials were forced to erect barricades to keep passerby from being brained by the bricks that kept falling off the side of the library. Unsurprisingly, a completely corrupt system had produced completely shoddy buildings that the taxpayers, already fleeced once, would have to pay to repair.
=== Campus renewal ===

On July 19, 2006, Chancellor Michael F. Collins ordered the immediate and permanent closure of the substructure parking garage, causing a loss of 1,500 parking spaces. Two days later, an article in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; summarized the deterioration of the facility:

The University of Massachusetts at Boston has closed an underground parking garage that has been decaying for decades. ... Over the years, the garage has become a dreary labyrinth, with walls and floor so eroded from the salty environment that they look like a coral reef. Nets hang from the ceiling to catch fragments of falling cement, a problem linked to the use of low-quality concrete in the construction.
Chunks of concrete had been falling from the garage ceiling since the 1990s, and when Chancellor Collins ordered the closure, 600 spaces had already been lost due to ongoing repairs and rerouting of passenger and vehicular traffic. Because of the salt water atmosphere and the road salt from vehicles, the steel reinforcing bars embedded in the campus substructure concrete walls and ceiling became severely degraded, and because all of the campus mechanical systems had run conduits through the substructure, many of those systems could not be repaired and the damage was causing outages of the computer, electrical, heat, and air-conditioning equipment. An engineering report indicated that to repair the garage such that it would be safe for parking would cost $150 million. On October 2, 2006, the university began the process of creating a master plan to renew the campus. In 2010, a 385-pound section of the garage ceiling below Wheatley Hall fell.

By December 14, 2007, Chancellor J. Keith Motley presented a 25-year master plan to the UMass System Board of Trustees, who accepted the plan in full. Included in the 25-year master plan was the proposal to erect the university&#x27;s first residential facilities that would accommodate 2,000 students, but not with the intention of changing the character of the university from a commuter school to a residential school. Eight months later on August 7, 2008, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick signed a higher education bond bill with $100 million directed towards the construction of a new integrated sciences complex at the Morrissey Boulevard entrance of the university&#x27;s campus, a second $100 million directed towards constructing a general academic building, and the following week, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts announced that he would accelerate his plans to construct the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate on Columbia Point next to his brother&#x27;s presidential library.

In December 2009, a report prepared for the state government on the 25-year master plan was released outlining future campus development and construction projects. By 2013, with the construction of the EMK Institute underway on April 8, 2011, the construction of the Integrated Sciences Complex underway on June 8, 2011, renovations to the Clark Athletic Center&#x27;s gymnasium from March to December 2012, construction for a second academic building (University Hall) underway on February 27, 2013, and a utility corridor and roadway network project begun in the spring of 2013, the university&#x27;s campus became &quot;a multi-site construction zone.&quot; Other completed or current projects include:

*A $2.8 million project begun the previous summer to stabilize an eroded 800-foot segment of the Dorchester Bay shoreline with 3,200 tons of stone (including a significant amount of granite unearthed by the Big Dig that was donated by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation), pave a new walkway along the Boston Harborwalk in between the JFK Presidential Library and the Harbor Point Apartments with new benches, lighting, gathering spaces, and an artwork display area that was completed in July 2015;
*A $164 million project to develop a new utility corridor and roadway network led by BVH Integrated Services, Inc. and built by Bond Brothers that was completed in 2019;
*A $45 million project managed by Hill International, designed by CannonDesign, and built by Consigli Construction to renovate Wheatley and McCormack Halls, the Quinn Administration Building, and the Healey Library to relocate programs from the original Science Center (to facilitate its demolition) that was completed in January 2020;
*A $78 million project to repair the substructure parking garage that was completed by February 2023;
*A $137 million project managed by Hill International and designed by NBBJ to demolish the original Science Center, the university swimming pool building, the majority of the campus substructure and plaza adjoining those facilities, and to construct a campus quadrangle and 300-space parking lot in their place, which began in July 2020 and was completed in 2024;
*A second general-purpose academic building (General Academic Building No. 2), which received $100 million in state funding in 2012 and that is to be built next to Wheatley Hall in between University Drives South and East and the Campus Center bus stop;
*A project to restore the Calf Pasture Pumping Station Complex and to construct a mixed-use facility on an adjacent 10-acre site for which the UMass Building Authority issued a request for information in January 2020, received eight proposals in response by the following September, and issued a request for proposal in July 2021.

In June 2021, Chancellor Suárez-Orozco initiated the development of an updated campus master plan. In October 2018, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced a comprehensive climate change adaptation proposal to protect the Boston Harbor coastline from flooding. In October 2020, the Walsh administration released a 174-page climate change adaptation report for the Boston Harbor coastline in Dorchester with a section on Columbia Point and Morrissey Boulevard.

<text>In computer science, bogosort (also known as permutation sort and stupid sort) is a sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not considered useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms. The algorithm&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;bogus&quot; and &quot;sort&quot;.

Two versions of this algorithm exist: a deterministic version that enumerates all permutations until it hits a sorted one, and a randomized version that randomly permutes its input and checks whether it is sorted. An analogy for the working of the latter version is to sort a deck of cards by throwing the deck into the air, picking the cards up at random, and repeating the process until the deck is sorted. In a worst-case scenario with this version, the random source is of low quality and happens to make the sorted permutation unlikely to occur. 

==Description of the algorithm==

=== Pseudocode ===
The following is a description of the randomized algorithm in pseudocode:

 while deck is not sorted:
 shuffle(deck)

=== C ===
An implementation in C:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

// executes in-place bogo sort on a given array
static void bogo_sort(int* a, int size);
// returns 1 if given array is sorted and 0 otherwise
static int is_sorted(int* a, int size);
// shuffles the given array into a random order
static void shuffle(int* a, int size);

void bogo_sort(int* a, int size) {
 while (!is_sorted(a, size)) {
 shuffle(a, size);
}

int is_sorted(int* a, int size) {
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; size-1; i++) {
 if (a[i] &gt; a[i+1]) {
 return 0;
 }
 return 1;

void shuffle(int* a, int size) {
 int temp, random;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
 random = (int) ((double) rand() / ((double) RAND_MAX + 1) * size);
 temp = a[random];
 a[random] = a[i];
 a[i] = temp;
}

int main() {
 // example usage
 int input[] = { 68, 14, 78, 98, 67, 89, 45, 90, 87, 78, 65, 74 };
 int size = sizeof(input) / sizeof(*input);

 // initialize pseudo-random number generator
 srand(time(NULL));

 bogo_sort(input, size);

 // sorted result: 14 45 65 67 68 74 78 78 87 89 90 98
 printf(&quot;sorted result:&quot;);
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
 printf(&quot; %d&quot;, input[i]);
 printf(&quot;\n&quot;);

 return 0;


=== Python ===
An implementation in Python:
import random
# this function checks whether or not the array is sorted
def is_sorted(random_array):
 for i in range(1, len(random_array)):
 if random_array[i] &lt; random_array[i - 1]:
 return False
 return True
# this function repeatedly shuffles the elements of the array until they are sorted
def bogo_sort(random_array):
 while not is_sorted(random_array):
 random.shuffle(random_array)
 return random_array
# this function generates an array with randomly chosen integer values
def generate_random_array(size, min_val, max_val):
 return [random.randint(min_val, max_val) for _ in range(size)]
# the size, minimum value and maximum value of the randomly generated array
size = 10
min_val = 1
max_val = 100
random_array = generate_random_array(size, min_val, max_val)
print(&quot;Unsorted array:&quot;, random_array)
sorted_arr = bogo_sort(random_array)
print(&quot;Sorted array:&quot;, sorted_arr)
This code assumes that is a simple, mutable, array-like data structure—like Python&#x27;s built-in —whose elements can be compared without issue.

==Running time and termination==

If all elements to be sorted are distinct, the expected number of comparisons performed in the average case by randomized bogosort is asymptotically equivalent to , and the expected number of swaps in the average case equals . The expected number of swaps grows faster than the expected number of comparisons, because if the elements are not in order, this will usually be discovered after only a few comparisons, no matter how many elements there are; but the work of shuffling the collection is proportional to its size. In the worst case, the number of comparisons and swaps are both unbounded, for the same reason that a tossed coin might turn up heads any number of times in a row.

The best case occurs if the list as given is already sorted; in this case the expected number of comparisons is , and no swaps at all are carried out.

For any collection of fixed size, the expected running time of the algorithm is finite for much the same reason that the infinite monkey theorem holds: there is some probability of getting the right permutation, so given an unbounded number of tries it will almost surely eventually be chosen.

<doc id="99878" wikidata="Q105441" url="?curid=99878" title="Lunenburg, Nova Scotia">
<text>Lunenburg () is a port town on the South Shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. Founded in 1753, the town was one of the first British attempts to settle Protestants in Nova Scotia.

Historically, Lunenburg&#x27;s economy relied on the offshore fishery, and today it hosts Canada&#x27;s largest secondary fish-processing plant. The town experienced prosperity in the late 1800s, and many of its architectural gems date back to that era.

In 1995, UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site. UNESCO considers the site the best example of planned British colonial settlement in North America, as it retains its original layout and appearance of the 1800s, including local wooden vernacular architecture. UNESCO considers the town in need of protection because the future of its traditional economic underpinnings, the Atlantic fishery, is now very uncertain.

The historic core of the town is also a National Historic Site of Canada.

==Toponymy==
Lunenburg was named in 1753 after the Duke of Braunschweig-Lüneburg who had become King George II of Great Britain. The Acadian inhabitants of the site had called it Mirliguèche, a French spelling of a Mi&#x27;kmaq name of uncertain meaning. An earlier Mi&#x27;kmaq name was āseedĭk, meaning clam-land.

==History==
The Mi&#x27;kmaq have lived in a territory from the present site of Lunenburg to Mahone Bay. At one point, as many as 300 Mi&#x27;kmaq people inhabited the site in the warm summer months. Acadians settled in the area around the 1620s. The Acadians and Mi’kmaq co-existed peacefully and some intermarried, creating networks of trade and kinship. In 1688, 10 Acadians and 11 Mi’kmaq were resident with dwellings and a small area of cultivated land. By 1745, there were eight families.

When Edward Cornwallis, newly appointed Governor of Nova Scotia, visited in 1749, he reported several Mi’kmaq and Acadian families living together at Mirliguèche in comfortable houses and said they &quot;appeared to be doing well.&quot;

Britain and France carried their military conflicts in Europe in the 1700s to the New World. Under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, France ceded the part of Acadia today known as peninsular Nova Scotia to Britain. To guard against Mi&#x27;kmaq, Acadian and French colonial attacks, the British erected Fort George in 1749 at Citadel Hill Halifax and founded the town of Halifax.

The British sought to settle the lands with loyal subjects, and recruited more than 1,400 Foreign Protestants, mostly artisans and farmers, from Europe in July 1753 to populate the site. The British had failed to provide promised land in Halifax to many of these settlers and they had become frustrated, causing problems for the British. The resettlement thus served the additional purpose of removing many of the Foreign Protestants from Halifax. Led by Charles Lawrence, the settlers were accompanied by about 160 soldiers. They assembled prefabricated blockhouses and constructed a palisade along the neck of land where the village was laid out. The settlers spent the summer building shelters for the winter and, not having been able to conduct any fishing or farming, had to be provisioned from Halifax. When the settlers became dissatisfied with the distribution of provisions and due to general distrust and frustration from mistreatment by the British, they rose in armed rebellion in The Lunenburg Rebellion and briefly declared a republic, only to be put down by troops led by Colonel Robert Monckton. Others defected to the Acadian side. In 1754, the town had a sawmill and a store.

In 1755, after the expulsion of the Acadians, the British needed to repopulate vacated lands. It offered generous land grants to colonists from New England, which was experiencing a severe shortage in land. Today these immigrants are referred to as the New England Planters. Lunenburg was raided in 1756 by a mixed group of Mi&#x27;kmaq and Maliseet raiders, devastating the town. The attacks continued on the British with the Lunenburg Campaign of 1758. Hostilities with Mi&#x27;kmaq ended around 1760.

During the American Revolution, privateers from the rebelling colonies raided Lunenburg, including the 1782 raid, devastating the town once again. The town was fortified at the beginning of the War of 1812. The British officials authorised the privateer &quot;Lunenburg,&quot; operated by Lunenburg residents, to raid American shipping.

Over the following years, port activities transitioned from coastal trade and local mixed fisheries, to offshore fisheries. During the Prohibition in the United States between 1920 and 1933, Lunenburg was a base for rum-running to the US.

The Lunenburg Cure was the term for a style of dried and salted cod that the city exported to markets in the Caribbean. Today a large hammered copper cod weather vane is mounted on the spire of St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church.

The Smith &amp; Rhuland shipyard built many boats, including &quot;Bluenose&quot; (1921), &quot;Flora Alberta&quot; (1941), &quot;Sherman Zwicker&quot; (1942), &quot;Bluenose II&quot; (1963), &quot;Bounty&quot; (1961), and the replica HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; (1970). In 1967 the yard was taken over by Scotia Trawler Equipment Limited. After the end of World War II, shipbuilders switched from producing schooners to trawlers, aided by migrant labour from Newfoundland.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
Lunenburg is in a natural harbour at the western side of Mahone Bay, about southwest of Downtown Halifax.

The area is built largely on Cambrian to Ordovician sedimentary deposits. The last glacial period transformed the landscape. Glaciers abraded and plucked at the bedrock during their advances across the country, creating various deposits that vary in thickness, including drumlins, which are a key feature of Lunenburg County.

The coastline in the area is heavily indented, and the town is on an isthmus on the Fairhaven Peninsula, with harbours on both the front and back sides.

===Climate===
The climate of Lunenburg is moderate, owing to its coastal location which helps to limit extremes in temperatures. This means it is slightly milder in winter and slightly cooler in summer than most areas at similar latitudes. Lunenburg enjoys warm, breezy summers with temperatures in the low to mid 20s °C (70s °F). It is seldom hot and humid. Winters are cold and frequently wet. Heavy winter snowfall can occur, but Lunenburg&#x27;s snowpack is usually short lived due to frequent winter rains and regular freeze-thaw cycles. Thick fog and damp conditions can occur at any time of year, but especially in spring. Seasonal lag due to cooler ocean temperatures means that spring conditions arrive in Lunenburg late in the season, often not until mid May. On the whole, Lunenburg precipitation is high from November to May, with July, August and September enjoying the warmest and driest conditions. Fall is typically bright, clear and cool.

===Old Town===
The original planned town was built on a steep south-facing hillside. It was laid out with compact lots in a rectangular grid pattern of narrow streets without regard to the topography. It is now known as the Old Town, and is the part of town which is protected by UNESCO. It is also the site of the old harbour. About 40 buildings in this area are on the Canadian Register of Historic Places including:
* Knaut-Rhuland House, 1793: Now a museum run by the Lunenburg Heritage Society.
* Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church, 1890: large wooden church.
* St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church, 1763: large wooden Carpenter Gothic church.
The Lunenburg Opera House is also in this area, though built in 1909, and not on the registry.

In 2005, the province of Nova Scotia bought 17 waterfront buildings from Clearwater Foods, the owner of the High Liner Foods brand, to ensure their preservation. Ownership was transferred to the Lunenburg Waterfront Association. Shipbuilding infrastructure worth $1.5 million was added to the Lunenburg waterfront as part of the Bluenose II restoration project, which started in 2010.

The site of the Smith &amp; Rhuland shipyard is now a recreational marina.

The Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic, part of the Nova Scotia Museum, includes a small fleet of vessels, including Bluenose II.

Parts of the waterfront are still used by business. The shipyard ABCO Industries was founded in 1947 on the site of the World War II Norwegian military training facility Camp Norway, and now builds welded aluminum vessels. Lunenburg Shipyard is owned and operated by Lunenburg Industrial Foundry &amp; Engineering. It offers a dry dock, manufacturing and machining, a carpentry shop, and a foundry capable of pouring 272 kg castings. There are wharves for commercial inshore fishing.

===New Town===
In the 1800s, Lunenburg prospered through shipping, trade, fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and outgrew its original boundaries. The town was extended into the east and west of the Old Town into what is now known as the New Town. This area includes about a dozen buildings on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.

==Governance==
Government in Nova Scotia has only two tiers: provincial and municipal. The province is divided into 50 municipalities, of which Lunenburg is one. The town is also within Lunenburg County, which was created for court sessional purposes in the 1860s and today has no government of its own, but the borders of which are coincident with certain provincial and federal electoral districts such as the Lunenburg Provincial Electoral District, and census districts. The county also covers the same terrain as the Municipality of the District of Lunenburg which surrounds, but does not include, Bridgewater, Lunenburg, and Mahone Bay, as they are incorporated separately and not part of the district municipality.

==Economy==
According to the 2016 census, the most common National Occupational Classification was sales and services, with 24 per cent of jobs. By the North American Industry Classification System, about half of all jobs were in health care and social assistance, accommodation and food services, manufacturing, and retail. High Liner Foods runs Canada&#x27;s largest secondary fish-processing plant in the town.

The town&#x27;s architecture and picturesque location make it attractive to the film industry. The dramatic and climactic wedding scenes of the award winning Canadian movie &quot;Cloudburst&quot; starring Olympia Dukakis were filmed in Lunenburg. Other films set in New England and filmed partly in Lunenburg include &quot;The Covenant&quot; and &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;. The 2010 Japanese movie &quot;Hanamizuki&quot; was partly set and filmed in Lunenburg. Further, the supernatural drama television show &quot;Haven&quot; was partly filmed there throughout its 5 season run, though the story is set in the U.S. State of Maine. The 2012 film &quot;The Disappeared&quot;, the 2020 television series &quot;Locke &amp; Key&quot;, and the fourth season of the 2017 television series &quot;The Sinner&quot; were filmed in Lunenburg.&quot;&quot;

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lunenburg had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2016, the majority of the population is English-speaking Canadian Protestants. At 58, the median age is higher than the provincial median of 46. Household incomes are similar to provincial averages.

<text>Autaugaville is a town in Autauga County, Alabama, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 795. It is part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Autaugaville is located at (32.432563, −86.658752).

The town is located in the central part of the state along Alabama State Route 14, which runs west to east through the center of town, leading east 14 mi (23 km) to Prattville, the Autauga County seat, and west 24 mi (39 km) to Selma.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it is water.

==History==

William Thompson, the first settler in what is now Autaugaville arrived around 1820 and built a gristmill and sawmill on Swift Creek, about three miles upriver from the Alabama River. One source says that the town incorporated in 1839, but another cites 1907. A cotton mill opened in 1849 on the banks of Swift Creek, and following upon the model of industrialist Daniel Pratt, the owner constructed housing for its employees, expanding the town. It grew further when many citizens from nearby Vernon relocated here to escape the floods and diseases to which that town was prone. By 1851, the town had a population of 351 and claimed four stores, two churches, and two schools.

Additional businesses opened during this period, including a cloth factory, a buggy and wagon factory, and a gristmill, making it a thriving manufacturing center. The downtown area was seriously damaged by a fire in 1853, but quickly rebuilt. The town&#x27;s first and only newspaper, the Autauga Citizen, also began publication in 1853, existing until 1873.

The Civil War and Reconstruction resulted in the closing of the town&#x27;s factories, including the cotton factory, which saw its shipments seized by the U.S. government. The war and its aftermath essentially ended Autaugaville&#x27;s status as a manufacturing center. The town incorporated in 1907, and the Alabama Central Railroad built a branch through town in 1911. At least one of several lumber mills operated periodically until the 1930s. In 1936, an Alabama Forestry Commission nursery opened near town. Crystal Lake Manufacturing Company makes brooms, mops, and handles in Autaugaville but closed at the end of 2020. Many Autaugaville residents are employed in the automotive parts industry.

== Education ==
Autaugaville is part of the Autauga County School System and is home to Autaugaville School for prekindergarten to grade 12 students.

<doc id="99881" wikidata="Q299983" url="?curid=99881" title="Andy Kaufman">
<text>Andrew Geoffrey Kaufman ( ; January 17, 1949 – May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer and performance artist. He has sometimes been called an &quot;anti-comedian&quot;. He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, once saying in an interview, &quot;I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. The comedian&#x27;s promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him. My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can.&quot;

After working in small comedy clubs in the early 1970s, Kaufman came to the attention of a wider audience in 1975, when he was invited to perform portions of his act on the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. His Foreign Man character was the basis of his performance as Latka Gravas on the television show &quot;Taxi&quot; from 1978 until 1983. During this time, he continued to tour comedy clubs and theaters in a series of unique performance art/comedy shows, sometimes appearing as himself and sometimes as obnoxiously rude lounge singer Tony Clifton. He was also a frequent guest on sketch comedy and late-night talk shows, particularly &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. In 1982, Kaufman brought his professional wrestling villain act to Letterman&#x27;s show by way of a staged encounter with Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler of the Continental Wrestling Association. The fact that the altercation was planned was not publicly disclosed for over a decade.

Kaufman died of lung cancer on May 16, 1984, at the age of 35. As pranks and elaborate ruses were major elements of his career, persistent rumors have circulated that Kaufman faked his own death as a grand hoax. He continues to be respected for the variety of his characters, his uniquely counterintuitive approach to comedy, and his willingness to provoke negative and confused reactions from audiences.

==Early life==
Kaufman was born on January 17, 1949, in New York City, the oldest of three children. He grew up with his younger brother Michael and sister Carol in a middle-class Jewish family in Great Neck, Long Island. His mother was Janice (née Bernstein), a homemaker and former fashion model, and his father was Stanley Kaufman, a jewelry salesman. Kaufman began performing at children&#x27;s birthday parties at age 9, playing records and showing cartoons. Kaufman spent much of his youth writing poetry and stories, including an unpublished novel, &quot;The Hollering Mangoo&quot;, which he completed at age 16. Following a visit to his school from Nigerian musician Babatunde Olatunji, Kaufman began playing the congas.

After graduating from Great Neck North High School in 1967, Kaufman took a year off before enrolling at the now defunct two-year Grahm Junior College in Boston, where he studied television production and starred in his own campus television show, &quot;Uncle Andy&#x27;s Fun House.&quot; In August 1969, he hitchhiked to Las Vegas to meet Elvis Presley, showing up unannounced at the International Hotel. Soon after, he began performing at coffee houses and developing his act, as well as writing a one-man play, &quot;Gosh&quot; (later renamed &quot;God&quot; and published in 2000). After graduating in 1971, he began performing stand-up comedy at various small clubs on the East Coast.

==Career==
===Foreign Man and Mighty Mouse===
Kaufman first received major attention for his character Foreign Man, who spoke in a meek, high-pitched, heavily accented voice and claimed to be from &quot;Caspiar&quot;, a fictional island in the Caspian Sea. It was as this character that Kaufman convinced the owner of the famed New York City comedy club The Improv, Budd Friedman, to allow him to perform on stage.

As Foreign Man, Kaufman would appear on the stage of comedy clubs, play a recording of the theme from the &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; cartoon show while standing perfectly still, and lip-sync only the line &quot;Here I come to save the day&quot; with great enthusiasm. He proceeded to tell a few (intentionally poor) jokes and concluded his act with a series of celebrity impersonations, with the comedy arising from the character&#x27;s obviously hopeless ineptitude at impersonation. For example, in his fake accent Kaufman announced to the audience, &quot;I would like to imitate Meester Carter, de president of de United States&quot; and then, in exactly the same voice, say &quot;Hello, I am Meester Carter, de president of de United States. T&#x27;ank you veddy much.&quot;
At some point in the performance, usually when the audience was conditioned to Foreign Man&#x27;s inability to perform a single convincing impression, Foreign Man would announce, &quot;And now I would like to imitate the Elvis Presley&quot;, turn around, take off his jacket, slick his hair back, and launch into a rousing, hip-shaking rendition of Presley singing one of his hit songs. Like Presley, he took off his leather jacket during the song and threw it into the audience, but unlike Presley, Foreign Man would immediately ask for it to be returned. After the song&#x27;s finale, he would take a simple bow and say in his Foreign Man voice, &quot;T&#x27;ank you veddy much.&quot;

Portions of Kaufman&#x27;s Foreign Man act were broadcast in the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The Mighty Mouse number was featured in the October 11, 1975, premiere, while the joke-telling and celebrity impressions (including Elvis) were included in the November 8 broadcast that same year.

===Latka===
The Foreign Man character was changed into Latka Gravas for ABC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;, appearing in 79 of 114 episodes in 1978–83. Bob Zmuda confirms this: &quot;They basically were buying Andy&#x27;s Foreign Man character for the &quot;Taxi&quot; character Latka.&quot; Kaufman&#x27;s longtime manager George Shapiro encouraged him to take the gig.

Kaufman disliked sitcoms and was not happy with the idea of being in one, but Shapiro convinced him that it would quickly lead to stardom, which would earn him money he could then put into his own act. Kaufman agreed to appear in 14 episodes per season, and he initially wanted four for Kaufman&#x27;s alter ego Tony Clifton. After Kaufman deliberately sabotaged Clifton&#x27;s appearance on the show, however, that part of his contract was dropped.

His character was given multiple personality disorder, which allowed Kaufman to randomly portray other characters. In one episode of &quot;Taxi&quot;, Kaufman&#x27;s character came down with a condition that made him act like Alex Rieger, the main character played by Judd Hirsch. Another such recurring character played by Kaufman was Latka&#x27;s womanizing alter ego Vic Ferrari.

Sam Simon, who early in his career was a writer and later showrunner for &quot;Taxi&quot;, stated in a 2013 interview on Marc Maron&#x27;s &quot;WTF&quot; podcast that the story of Kaufman having been generally disruptive on the show was &quot;a complete fiction&quot; largely created by Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a vested interest in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was &quot;completely professional&quot; and that he &quot;told you Tony Clifton was him&quot;, but he also conceded that Kaufman would have &quot;loved&quot; Zmuda&#x27;s version of events.

Kaufman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television for &quot;Taxi&quot; in 1979 and 1981.

===Tony Clifton===
Another well-known Kaufman character is Tony Clifton, an absurd, audience-abusing lounge singer who began opening for Kaufman at comedy clubs and eventually even performed concerts on his own around the country. Sometimes it was Kaufman performing as Clifton, sometimes it was his brother Michael or Zmuda. For a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman&#x27;s opening act, with the mood turning ugly whenever Kaufman&#x27;s name came up. Kaufman, Clifton insisted, was attempting to ruin Clifton&#x27;s &quot;good name&quot; in order to make money and become famous.

As a requirement for Kaufman&#x27;s accepting the offer to star on &quot;Taxi&quot;, he insisted that Clifton be hired for a guest role on the show as if he were a real person, not a character. After throwing a tantrum on the set, Clifton was fired and escorted from the studio lot by security guards. Much to Kaufman&#x27;s delight, this incident was reported in the local newspapers.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Elvis sketch incident===

On the January 30, 1982, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, while impersonating Elvis Presley in a sketch, Kaufman broke character by removing his wig and apologizing to the audience.

Kaufman explained this incident on the February 17, 1982, episode of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. He said that he had apologized because he disagreed with how Presley was portrayed in the sketch, which involved Presley instructing two young women from his audience to visit him backstage, where they would wrestle topless in mud. Kaufman said that he had initially declined to perform the sketch but was pressured into it. He also alleged that &quot;SNL&quot; staff threatened to ruin his reputation in the industry if he did not perform the sketch.

The sketch was a reference to an incident alleged by Albert Goldman&#x27;s controversial 1981 biography of Presley. Critics of the biography derided its scornful tone and charged that it was intended as an exposé. Kaufman said that Goldman threatened to sue him after the episode aired, but Kaufman challenged Goldman to a public debate on Presley&#x27;s character.

===Carnegie Hall show===
At the beginning of an April 1979 performance at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall, Kaufman invited his &quot;grandmother&quot; to watch the show from a chair that he had placed at the side of the stage. At the end of the show, she stood, removed her mask, and revealed to the audience that she was actually comedian Robin Williams.

Kaufman also had an elderly woman (Eleanor Cody Gould) pretend to have a heart attack and die on stage, after which he reappeared on stage wearing a Native American headdress and performing a dance over her body, &quot;reviving&quot; her.

Kaufman ended the show by taking the entire audience, in 24 buses, for milk and cookies. He invited anyone interested to meet him on the Staten Island Ferry the next morning, where the show continued.

===TV specials===
The &quot;Taxi&quot; deal with ABC included a television special/pilot for Kaufman. He proposed &quot;Andy&#x27;s Funhouse&quot;, based on a routine that he had developed while in junior college. The special was taped in 1977 but did not air until August 1979. It featured most of Andy&#x27;s famous gags, including Foreign Man/Latka and his Elvis Presley impersonation, as well as a host of unique segments (including a special appearance by children&#x27;s television character Howdy Doody and the &quot;Has-been Corner&quot;). The program also included a segment with fake television screen static as part of the gag, although ABC executives feared that viewers would mistake the static for broadcast problems and would change the channel—which was the comic element that Kaufman wanted to present. &quot;Andy&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; was written by Kaufman, Zmuda and Mel Sherer, with music by Kaufman.

In March 1980, Kaufman filmed a short segment for an ABC show called &quot;Buckshot.&quot; The segment was just over six minutes long and was called &quot;Uncle Andy&#x27;s Funhouse&quot;. It featured Kaufman as the host of a children&#x27;s show for adults, complete with a peanut gallery and Tony Clifton puppet.

In 1983, a show very similar to &quot;Andy&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; and &quot;Uncle Andy&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; was filmed for PBS&#x27;s SoundStage program called &quot;The Andy Kaufman Show&quot;. It too featured a peanut gallery, and opened in the middle of an interview in which Kaufman was laughing hysterically. He then proceeded to thank the audience for watching and the credits rolled.

===&quot;Fridays&quot; incidents===
In 1981, Kaufman made three appearances on &quot;Fridays&quot;, a variety show on ABC that was similar to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In the last sketch on his first appearance, the cast were to deliberately break the scene and improvise an argument. Kaufman broke character first, announcing that he &quot;felt stupid&quot; and refusing to say his lines. In response, cast member Michael Richards walked off camera, returned with a set of cue cards, and dumped them on the table in front of Kaufman, who responded by splashing Richards with water. Coproducer Jack Burns stormed onto the stage, leading to a fake brawl on camera before the show cut to a commercial.

Richards claimed that what was going to happen was known only to him, Burns and Kaufman, but Melanie Chartoff, who played Kaufman&#x27;s wife in the sketch, said that just before airtime Burns told her, Richards, and Maryedith Burrell that Kaufman was going to break the fourth wall.

Kaufman appeared the next week in a videotaped &quot;apology&quot; to the home viewers. Later that year, he returned to host &quot;Fridays&quot;. At one point during the show, he invited &quot;Lawrence Welk Show&quot; singer Kathie Sullivan to the stage to sing some gospel songs with him and announced that the two were engaged to be married. He then talked to the audience about his newfound faith in Jesus (Kaufman was Jewish), but the scene was a hoax. Later, following a sketch about a drug-abusing pharmacist, instead of introducing Pretenders, he delivered a nervous speech about the harmfulness of drugs while the band stood behind him ready to play. After his speech, he informed the audience that he had talked too long and that the show needed to pause for a commercial break.

===Appearances===
Although Kaufman made a name for himself as a guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, his first prime-time appearances were several guest spots as Foreign Man on the Dick Van Dyke variety show &quot;Van Dyke and Company&quot; in 1976. He appeared four times on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1976–78, with Foreign Man doing his imitation of Johnny Carson&#x27;s sidekick Ed McMahon, with no change in voice: &quot;Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. How hot &quot;was&quot; eet. Ha ha ha.&quot; Kaufman also appeared three times on NBC&#x27;s late-night concert series &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; in 1972, 1977, and 1981. Kaufman appeared on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; in 1978, in character as Foreign Man, and cried when the bachelorette chose Bachelor #1, protesting that he had answered all the questions correctly.

His &quot;SNL&quot; appearances started with the first show, on October 11, 1975. He made 16 &quot;SNL&quot; appearances in all, doing routines from his comedy act, such as the Mighty Mouse singalong, Foreign Man, and the Elvis impersonation. After he angered the audience with his female-wrestling routine, executive producer Dick Ebersol announced on the show that viewers would be allowed to decide Kaufman&#x27;s fate. On the November 20, 1982 episode, &quot;SNL&quot; ran a phone vote, and 195,544 people voted to &quot;Dump Andy&quot; while 169,186 people voted to &quot;Keep Andy&quot;.

During the &quot;SNL&quot; episode with the phone poll, many of the cast members stated their admiration for Kaufman&#x27;s work. After Eddie Murphy read both numbers, he said, &quot;Now, Andy Kaufman is a friend of mine. Keep that in mind when you call. I don&#x27;t want to have to punch nobody in America in the face&quot;, and Mary Gross read the Dump Andy phone number at a rate so fast that audiences were unable to catch it. The final tally was read by Gary Kroeger to a cheering audience. As the credits rolled, announcer Don Pardo said, &quot;This is Don Pardo saying, &#x27;I voted for Andy Kaufman.&#x27;&quot;

Following the poll results, Kaufman made one final appearance on the show via a prerecorded 30-second message on Weekend Update (then rebranded as &quot;Saturday Night News&quot;). The message had Andy stating his gratitude for being on the show and that he had to resort to buying time on low-rated independent TV stations in order for him to be heard. After wrapping up, cast member-anchorman Brad Hall added the footnote &quot;It&#x27;s pretty sad. NBC would like to announce that not only is Kaufman still banned from this show, but he now owes the NBC television network several thousand dollars (to pay for the airtime) and some change.&quot; This would be Kaufman&#x27;s last appearance on the show.

Kaufman made a number of appearances on the daytime edition of &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; in 1980, and 11 appearances on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in 1982–83. He made numerous guest spots on other television programs hosted by or starring celebrities like Johnny Cash (1979 Christmas special), Dick Van Dyke, Dinah Shore, Rodney Dangerfield, Cher, Dean Martin, Redd Foxx, Mike Douglas, Dick Clark, and Joe Franklin.

He appeared in his first theatrical film, &quot;God Told Me To&quot;, in 1976, in which he portrayed a murderous policeman. He appeared in two other theatrical films, including the 1980 film &quot;In God We Tru$t&quot;, in which he played a televangelist, and the 1981 film &quot;Heartbeeps&quot;, in which he played a robot.

Laurie Anderson worked alongside Kaufman for a time in the 1970s, acting as a sort of &quot;straight man&quot; in a number of his Manhattan and Coney Island performances. One of these performances included getting on a ride that people stand in and get spun around. After everyone was strapped in, Kaufman would start saying how he did not want to be on the ride in a panicked tone and eventually cry. Anderson later described these performances in her 1995 album, &quot;The Ugly One with the Jewels&quot;.

In 1983, Kaufman appeared on Broadway with Deborah Harry in the play &quot;Teaneck Tanzi: The Venus Flytrap&quot;. It closed after just two performances.

==Professional wrestling==

Inspired by the theatricality of &quot;kayfabe&quot;, the staged nature of the sport of professional wrestling, and his own tendency to form elaborate hoaxes, Kaufman began wrestling women during his act and proclaimed himself &quot;Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World&quot;, taking on an aggressive and ridiculous personality based on the characters invented by professional wrestlers. He offered a $1,000 prize to any woman who could pin him. He employed performance artist Laurie Anderson, a friend of his, in this act for a while.

Kaufman initially approached the head of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) Vince McMahon Sr., about bringing his act to the northeast wrestling territory. McMahon dismissed Kaufman&#x27;s idea, as the elder McMahon was not about to bring &quot;show business&quot; into his Pro Wrestling society. Kaufman had by then developed a friendship with wrestling reporter/photographer Bill Apter. After many discussions about Kaufman&#x27;s desire to be in the pro wrestling business, Apter called Memphis wrestling icon Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler and introduced him to Kaufman by telephone.

Kaufman finally stepped into the ring (in the Memphis wrestling circuit) with a man—Lawler himself. Kaufman taunted the residents of Memphis by playing &quot;videos showing residents how to use soap&quot; and proclaiming the city to be &quot;the nation&#x27;s redneck capital&quot;. The ongoing Lawler–Kaufman feud, which often featured Jimmy Hart and other heels in Kaufman&#x27;s corner, included a number of staged &quot;works&quot;, such as a broken neck for Kaufman as a result of Lawler&#x27;s piledriver and a famous on-air fight on a 1982 episode of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.

For some time after that first match, Kaufman appeared wearing a neck brace, insisting that his injuries were much worse than they really were. Kaufman continued to defend the Inter-Gender Championship in the Mid-South Coliseum and offered an extra prize, other than the $1,000: that if he were pinned, the woman who pinned him would get to marry him and that Kaufman would also shave his head.

Eventually it was revealed that the feud and wrestling matches were staged works, and that Kaufman and Lawler were friends. This was not disclosed until more than 10 years after Kaufman&#x27;s death, when the Emmy-nominated documentary &quot;A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman&quot; aired on NBC in 1995. Jim Carrey, who revealed the secret, later went on to play Kaufman in the 1999 film &quot;Man on the Moon.&quot; In a 1997 interview with the &quot;Memphis Flyer&quot;, Lawler said he had improvised during their first match and the &quot;Letterman&quot; incident.

Although officials at St. Francis Hospital stated that Kaufman&#x27;s neck injuries were real, in his 2002 biography &quot;It&#x27;s Good to Be the King ... Sometimes&quot;, Lawler detailed how they came up with the angle and kept it quiet. Even though Kaufman&#x27;s injury was legitimate, the pair exaggerated it. He also said that Kaufman&#x27;s furious tirade and performance on &quot;Letterman&quot; was Kaufman&#x27;s own idea, including when Lawler slapped Kaufman out of his chair. Promoter Jerry Jarrett later recalled that for two years he mailed Kaufman payments comparable to what other main-event wrestlers were getting at the time, but Kaufman never deposited the checks.

Kaufman appeared in the 1983 film &quot;My Breakfast with Blassie&quot; with professional wrestling personality &quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie. The film was a parody of the art film &quot;My Dinner with Andre.&quot; Lynne Margulies, sister of the film&#x27;s director, Johnny Legend, appears in it, and became romantically involved with Kaufman.

In 2002, Kaufman became a playable character in the video game &quot;Legends of Wrestling II&quot; and a standard character in 2004&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. In 2008, Jakks Pacific produced for their WWE Classic Superstars toy line an action figure two-pack of Kaufman and Lawler, as well as a separate figure release with a royal blue robe.

On March 20, 2023, Kaufman was announced as the third inductee into the 2023 WWE Hall of Fame. He was inducted by Jimmy Hart.

==Personal life==
Kaufman never married. His daughter, Maria Bellu-Colonna (born 1969), was the child of a relationship with a high-school girlfriend and was placed for adoption. Bellu-Colonna learned in 1992 that she was Kaufman&#x27;s daughter when she traced her biological roots. She soon reunited with her mother, grandfather, uncle, and aunt. Bellu-Colonna&#x27;s daughter Brittany briefly appeared in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, playing Kaufman&#x27;s sister Carol as a young child.

In December 1969, Kaufman learned Transcendental Meditation at college. According to a BBC article, he used the technique &quot;to build confidence and take his act to comedy clubs.&quot; For the rest of his life, Kaufman meditated and performed yoga three hours per day. From February to June 1971, he trained as a teacher of Transcendental Meditation in Mallorca, Spain.

Lynne Margulies, who met Kaufman during the filming of &quot;My Breakfast with Blassie&quot;, was in a relationship with Kaufman from 1982 until his death in 1984. Margulies later codirected the 1989 Kaufman wrestling compilation &quot;I&#x27;m from Hollywood&quot;, and published the 2009 book &quot;Dear Andy Kaufman, I Hate Your Guts!&quot;.

Kaufman kept his personal life secret and instead engaged in pranks and stunts to further obscure it, such as claiming in a September 22, 1983, appearance on David Letterman&#x27;s show to have adopted three sons.

==Illness and death==

At a Thanksgiving dinner on Long Island in November 1983, several family members openly expressed worry about Kaufman&#x27;s persistent coughing. He claimed that he had been coughing for nearly a month, visited his doctor and was told that nothing was wrong. When he returned to Los Angeles, he consulted another physician and then underwent a series of tests at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. A few days later, he was diagnosed with large-cell carcinoma of the lung, typically associated with smoking.

After audiences were shocked by his gaunt appearance during January 1984 performances, Kaufman acknowledged that he had an unspecified illness that he hoped to cure with natural medicine, including a diet of all fruits and vegetables among other measures. Kaufman received palliative radiotherapy but by then the cancer had spread from his lungs to his brain. His final public appearance was at the premiere of &quot;My Breakfast with Blassie&quot; in March 1984, where he appeared thin and with a mohawk hair style (radiation treatments had caused the loss of his hair).

The next day, Kaufman and Margulies flew to Baguio, Philippines, where, as a last resort, he received treatments of a pseudoscientific procedure called psychic surgery (now recognized as explicitly deceptive medical fraud).

Afterward, Kaufman initially said that he felt better and returned to the U.S. but he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 16, 1984 at the age of 35. He is buried in Beth David Cemetery in Elmont, New York.

===Death-hoax rumors===

Kaufman often spoke of faking his own death as a grand hoax with rumors persisting, often fueled by sporadic appearances of Kaufman&#x27;s character Tony Clifton at comedy clubs after his death. Kaufman&#x27;s official website describes the faked death story as an &quot;urban legend&quot; and includes a picture of his death certificate.

&quot;Clifton&quot; performed a year after Kaufman&#x27;s death at The Comedy Store benefit in Kaufman&#x27;s honor, with members of his entourage in attendance and during the 1990s made several appearances at Los Angeles nightclubs. Jim Carrey, who portrayed Kaufman in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, stated on the NBC special &quot;Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman&quot; that Bob Zmuda had been performing as the Clifton character.

In 2013, responding to rumors that Kaufman was still alive and following the appearance of an actress who claimed to be Kaufman&#x27;s daughter, the Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s office rereleased Kaufman&#x27;s death certificate to confirm that he was indeed dead and had been interred at Beth David Cemetery.

In 2014, Zmuda and Margulies coauthored &quot;Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally&quot;, a book claiming that Kaufman&#x27;s death was indeed a prank, and that he would soon reveal himself, as his upper limit on the &quot;prank&quot; was 30 years. Kaufman did not reappear.

==Legacy and tributes==
Comedian Elayne Boosler, who dated and lived with Kaufman and credits him with encouraging her comedy career, wrote an article for &quot;Esquire&quot; in November 1984 in his memory. She also dedicated her 1986 Showtime special &quot;Party of One&quot; to Kaufman. An audio recording of Kaufman offering encouragement to Boosler is featured in the intro.

In 1992, the band R.E.M. released the song &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, a tribute to Kaufman. The song&#x27;s video featured footage of Kaufman. On March 29, 1995, NBC aired &quot;A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman&quot;. The special featured clips of many of Kaufman&#x27;s performances, as well as commentary by some of his friends, family and colleagues. During the special, comedian Richard Lewis said: &quot;No one has ever done what Andy did, and did it as well, and no one will ever. Because he did it first. So did Buster Keaton, so did Andy.&quot; Carl Reiner recalled his distinction in the comedy world:Did Andy influence comedy? No. Because nobody&#x27;s doing what he did. Jim Carrey was influenced—not to do what Andy did, but to follow his own drummer. I think Andy did that for a lot of people. Follow your own drumbeat. You didn&#x27;t have to go up there and say &quot;take my wife, please&quot;. You could do anything that struck you as entertaining. It gave people freedom to be themselves.Reiner also said of Kaufman: &quot;Nobody can see past the edges, where the character begins and he ends.&quot;

Carrey portrayed Kaufman in the 1999 biopic film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, directed by Miloš Forman. The film took its title from R.E.M.&#x27;s song of the same name. R.E.M. also performed the score for the film and recorded another Kaufman tribute song, &quot;The Great Beyond&quot;. Carrey&#x27;s portrayal was met with critical acclaim, earning him a Golden Globe Award for his performance. Forman named his twin sons Andrew and James after Kaufman and Carrey. In July 2012, Kaufman&#x27;s play &quot;Bohemia West&quot; was staged in Providence, Rhode Island. Comedian Vernon Chatman compiled and produced Kaufman&#x27;s first album, &quot;Andy and His Grandmother&quot;, via Drag City in 2013.

Kaufman is one of the featured celebrities in the 2005 children&#x27;s book &quot;Different Like Me: My Book of Autism Heroes&quot;. Actress Cindy Williams, who was a close friend of Kaufman, devoted an entire chapter of her autobiography, &quot;Shirley, I Jest!: A Storied Life,&quot; to him. &quot;The Chris Gethard Show&quot; paid homage to the Kaufman &quot;Fridays&quot; incident with comedian Brett Davis throwing water on someone&#x27;s face.

A neon likeness of Kaufman is on display at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles. The club&#x27;s menu features the Andy Kaufman Special, which consists of &quot;two cookies and a glass of ice cold milk.&quot;

The Vic Ferrari Band took its name from Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Taxi&quot; character.

According to executive producer Bill Oakley, the 1996 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart the Fink&quot;, in which Krusty the Clown fakes his death, was partially inspired by the rumors of Kaufman&#x27;s faked death.

Al Jean, cocreator of the animated series &quot;The Critic&quot;, has said that the first-season drawing of Jon Lovitz&#x27;s character Jay Sherman was loosely based on Kaufman.

In 2015, a bottled fragrance called Andy Kaufman Milk &amp; Cookies was created.

German filmmaker Maren Ade has said that her 2016 film &quot;Toni Erdmann&quot;, which was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, was partially inspired by Kaufman and Tony Clifton.

Since 2004, the Andy Kaufman Award competition has been held annually as &quot;a showcase for promising cutting-edge artists with fresh and unconventional material, for those willing to take risks with an audience, and for those who do not define themselves by the typical conventions of comedy.&quot; Winners include Reggie Watts, Kristen Schaal, Brett Davis, Marcus Monroe, Brent Weinbach, Suzanne Whang, Nick Vatterott, Harry Terjanian, and Dru Johnston. For the 2015 Andy Kaufman Award show, Two Boots Pizza created a special Andy Kaufman pizza.

On June 20, 2019, it was announced that Kaufman would be honored with a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the television category. He was part of the class of 2020.

The Russian band Korol&#x27; i Shut recorded the song &quot;Endi Kaufman&quot; on its album &quot;Teatr Demona&quot;.

On March 20, 2023, Kaufman was inducted to the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2023.

Kaufman is played by Nicholas Braun in the film &quot;Saturday Night,&quot; which chronicles the production of the first episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;

Billingsley was initially referred to as Cartersville after the W. W. Carter family (the first settlers in the area) established a grist mill, a lumber company, and a cotton gin in the area. By the time the settlement had grown enough to warrant an official name, however, the Carter family was no longer the largest family, having been surpassed by the Billingsley family. Therefore, the town was named in honor of Clement Billingsley, who had served in the Revolutionary War. Billingsley was one of several war veterans from Virginia who moved west to present-day Autauga County. Upon Billingsley’s death in 1844, his assets, which included land, money, and enslaved African Americans, were divided among his children, thereby increasing the family’s prominence in the county. Billingsley is buried in the Gaines Cemetery in the town.

<text>Bay Minette is a city in and the county seat of Baldwin County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 8,044.

==History==
In the first days of Baldwin County, the town of McIntosh Bluff (now in Mobile County, west of Baldwin County) on the Tombigbee River was the county seat. After being transferred to the town of Blakeley in 1810, the county seat was later moved to the city of Daphne in 1868. In 1900, by an act of the legislature of Alabama, the county seat was authorized for relocation to the city of Bay Minette; however, the city of Daphne resisted relocation. The citizens of Bay Minette moved the county records from Daphne in the middle of the night on October 11–12, 1901 and delivered them to the city of Bay Minette, where the Baldwin County seat remains to this day. A mural for the new post office built in 1937 was commissioned by the WPA and painted by Hilton Leech to commemorate this event.

In September 2011, the town attempted to enact a program called &quot;Operation Restore Our Community&quot;. It would have allowed those convicted of a misdemeanor to substitute imprisonment with mandatory church attendance for one year. However, this program was challenged due to violating separation of church and state, and the program&#x27;s start was delayed for judicial review. It appears to have been scrapped.
