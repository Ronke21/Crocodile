<text>Scouting in Texas has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. Scouting, also known as the Scout Movement, is a worldwide youth movement with the stated aim of supporting young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, so that they may play constructive roles in society.

The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) provides Scouting for boys and girls in all programs. Texas is home to the BSA national headquarters, in Irving, Texas. The Boy Scouts of America in Texas are organized into 20 local councils.

Girl Scouts of the USA, organized into eight local councils, only serves girls.
==History==
Scouting in Texas unofficially dates to the publication of British lieutenant general Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s popular book, &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, in 1908. Even before a national organization had been started, groups of boys began Scout activities in troops and small groups in 1908, 1909, and 1910. The claims of several troops to be the first organized in Texas, whether before or after the incorporation of the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910, are difficult to verify. BSA archives do show that the thirty-seventh registered scoutmaster in the country was a Texan, Rev. George W. Sheafor, of Comanche, in 1910.

In February 1910, just days after the Boy Scouts of America was organized, Boy Scout Troop 114 was established in Floresville, Texas by Professor W.H. Butler. A reference to the Floresville Boy Scout Troop can be found in the edition of April 2, 1911 of &quot;The Galveston Daily News&quot; when they published a picture of the Floresville troop. An article in the Victoria, &quot;Weekly Advocate&quot; (probably January 10, 1911 edition) refers to the Floresville Boy Scout troop as the second oldest in Texas. A short break in the troop&#x27;s charter occurred in 1974. They no longer appear to be an active Troop.

Austin, TX Troop 5 was formed in 1911 and has been in continuous operation since that time. In 2011, Austin Troop 5 celebrated its 100th anniversary centennial at Camp Mabry. Troop 5 is believed to be the oldest continuously chartered scout troop in Texas.

In 1913 Troop 7 was established in Grapevine, Texas. The troop has been chartered every year since starting except 1979.

In 1916 Troop 1 was established in Wichita Falls, Texas. Troop 1 in Wichita Falls has been continuously chartered since 1916.

In 1925 Troop 30 was established in Houston, Texas. The troop has been continuously chartered since 1925.

An African American troop was formed in Port Arthur as early as 1916. The BSA report to Congress for 1930 named Dallas as one of the southern cities in which Scouting was growing in the black community. Hispanic boys were also active in Scouting, often in units with non-Hispanic boys. Jewish youth had been active in Scouting in San Antonio for many years before a synagogue sponsored a troop for them in 1924.

By 1918, unofficial Wolf Cub packs appeared in Paris, Texas.

The BSA national office was moved to Irving in 1979.

The Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council traces its roots back to the 1920s when Frances Mann Law and Corrinne Fonde organized a Girl Scout Council in Houston. The council office was in a three roomed cottage.

Most Girl Scouts of the USA units were originally segregated by race according to state and local laws and customs. The first troop for Mexican Americans was formed in Houston in 1922. In 1936, the first African American Girl Scout troop west of the Mississippi was formed in Texas.

The Girl Scouts&#x27; Camp Texlake was dedicated in 1949.

==Boy Scouts of America in Texas==
Texas is home to the BSA National Headquarters in Irving, Texas. The National Scouting Museum was located in Irving from October 2002 until September 2017 when it was moved to Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico.

<text>Scouting in Utah has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.
==History==
The first known Boy Scout Troop was the Episcopalian Troop One led by Reverend Rice, a missionary to Utah. This troop assembled in 1907 and continued their meetings and camp-outs through 1910. The second known Boy Scout Troop got its start in Logan, Utah in 1910.

On May 21, 1913, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#x27; 15-month-old &quot;Mutual Improvement Association Scout&quot; program was officially invited to join the Boy Scouts of America. This started the first widespread movement in Utah Scouting. By 1928, the LDS Church had designated Scouting as the official activity program for its young men.

In 1916, the Logan Council (#588) was formed. It changed its name to the Cache Valley Council (#588) in 1922, changing it again in 1924 to Cache Valley Area Council (#588). In 1919, the Ogden Council (#589) was formed. It changed its name to the Ogden Gateway Area Council (#589) in 1922, changing it again in 1934 to Ogden Area Council (#589). In 1951, the Ogden Area Council changed its name Lake Bonneville Council (#589).

In 1920, Ogden Council Scout Executive, G.A. Goates, led 85 boys and Scoutmasters on a 14-day hike through Yellowstone National Park. According to the Department of the Interior, 3,800 feet of motion picture film was taken of the trip.

In 1916, the Salt Lake City Council (#590) was formed. It changed its name to the Salt Lake and South Davis Counties Council (#590) in 1926, changing it again in 1926 to Salt Lake City Area Council (#590). In 1951 it changed its name to Great Salt Lake Council (#590). In 1921, the Utah County Council (#591) was formed. In 1922 it changed its name to the Timpanagos Area Council (#591). In 1924, the Zion National Park Council (#670) was formed. In 1930 it merged with Timpanagos Area Council. In 1924, the Bryce Canyon Council (#671) was formed. In 1936 it merged with Timpanagos Area Council to become the Utah National Parks Council (#591).

Until its withdrawal in 2019, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints remained a major sponsor of Scouting in Utah, however churches of other faiths, and other non-profit organizations continue to be sponsors of Utah Scouting programs. Most, if not all troops welcome those of all faiths to their program.

Until 1993, the Lake Bonneville Council and Cache Valley Council covered northern Utah. Those councils merged with the Jim Bridger Council (#639) to become the Trapper Trails Council. Along with the Great Salt Lake Council of central Utah and the Utah National Parks Council of southern Utah, the Trapper Trails Council became part of the Crossroads of the West Council (#590) in 2020 following the withdrawal of the LDS Church from scouting. The Snake River Council served Scouts in Idaho and Nevada, as well as Utah, prior to its merger into the Mountain West Council.

==Boy Scouts of America in Utah today==
Utah and adjacent parts of Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming are currently served by Scouts BSA&#x27;s Crossroads of the West Council.

==Girl Scouting in Utah==
Two Girl Scout councils serve Utah.

===History===

Girl Scouting in Utah started in 1920 in Ogden, Utah and the first troops registered in Salt Lake City in 1921. In 1961 the current major council in Utah, Girl Scouts of Utah, was founded by the merging of several smaller councils.

===Girl Scouts-Arizona Cactus-Pine Council===

In Utah, Girl Scouts-Arizona Cactus-Pine Council, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, serves girls living on the Navajo Nation in southern Utah.

===Girl Scouts of Utah===

Girl Scouts of Utah, headquartered in Salt Lake City, serves over 9,000 girls in Utah and West Wendover, Nevada.

;Service Centers:
*Northern Utah Service Center in Riverdale, Utah
*Central Utah Service Center in Orem, Utah

;Camps
*Camp Cloud Rim is at over by Lake Brimhall in the Wasatch Mountains near Park City, Utah. It was built by the Utah Works Progress Administration in the early 1930s. Originally named Camp Pinar, it was renamed to Camp Cloud Rim in 1937. The Lodge was destroyed by fire in 1992 but rebuilt and named the Janet Quinney Lawson Lodge. The new lodge was dedicated on August 14, 1999, and Janet Quinney Lawson was in attendance for the ceremony. In 2013, the Girl Scouts of Utah council officially bought 236 acres of land just south of Cloud Rim from Silver Islet Lake Partners. The land has a conservation easement on all but 18 acres, so the Girl Scouts plan to build some rustic cabins, but will mostly preserve the land. 
*Trefoil Ranch is near Provo, Utah. It was built in 1943 by volunteers. In 2002, a new lodge was built and dedicated in 2003 featuring new restrooms, a classroom facility, and a new showerhouse.

<text>Scouting in the US state of Washington officially began in the 1910s.

==History==
In 1910, a Spokane, Washington Boy Scout leader, the Reverend David Ferry, created a troop under the name of Girl Guides of America. The Girl Guides did not expand much beyond the local area. In 1911, the Girl Scouts of America (not to be confused with the current Girl Scouts of the USA) and the Girl Guides planned to merge with the Camp Fire Girls to form the Girl Pioneers of America, but relationships fractured and the merger failed.

Founded in 1919, Camp Parsons is the oldest continuous running Boy Scout camp west of the Mississippi River and one of the oldest continually running Boy Scout camp in the United States on its original location. It sits on , part of the Hood Canal, on the Olympic Peninsula, just north of Brinnon, Washington, and just south of Quilcene, Washington. The original land for the camp was donated by Reginald Parsons in 1918.

Camp Black Mountain was founded as a campsite near Maple Falls, Washington which served Western Washington since 1929. 

===Recent history, sale of camp===
In 1993, Tumwater Area(#737), Twin Harbors Area (#607), and Mount Rainier (#612) merged to form the Pacific Harbors Council (#612). In 1992, the North Central Washington Council (#613) and the Fort Simcoe Area Council (#614) merged to become the Grand Columbia Council (#614).

In 1987, Inland Empire Council changed its name to the Inland Northwest Council (#611). In 1992, Lewis-Clark (#108) and Idaho Panhandle (#110) councils merged into Inland Northwest. In 1956 the Olympic Area Council was formed, merging into Chief Seattle in 1974. In 1994, the Mount Baker Area (#603) and Evergreen Area (#606) councils merged to become the Mount Baker (#606).

By 2012, the Mount Baker Council was working with an &quot;annual operating loss of about $50,000 for each of the past five years&quot;, and was looking to sell the Whatcom County camp, even though that camp, and Camp Fire Mountain Skagit County, were still profitable. It was purchased by a private company in 2015 which has renovated the site. It is being rented out as of 2023.

==Early history (1910–1950)==

The Cheyenne Council was founded in 1920, and in 1925 changed its name to the Southeastern Wyoming Council. The Council merged into Longs Peak Council in 1928.

In 1917, the Casper Council (#638) was formed, changing its name to Casper Area Council in 1925. It reformed in 1918, merging into Central Wyoming Council (#638) in 1931.

In 1920, the Sheridan Council (#640), changing its name to Sheridan County Council in 1922; changing its name again to Sheridan Area Council in 1926.

In 1929, the Central Wyoming Council (#638) was formed.

In southwestern Wyoming the Jim Bridger Council was headquartered in Rock Springs, Wy. The Jim Bridger Council had a Scout Camp at New Fork Lakes on the northwestern slope of the Wind River Mountains. The Jim Bridger Council encompassed the Green River Basin and included the Woodruff and Randolph Utah Area. Towns included in the council were Rock Springs, Green River, Pinedale, Big Piney, Kemmerer, Opal, Mountain View, Lyman, Fort Bridger and Evanston. The council was merged with two councils in Utah in the early 1990s. The council was home to Order of the Arrow Lodge 529 – Tatanka.

During World War II, Norman Mineta was detained in the Heart Mountain internment camp near Cody, Wyoming, along with thousands of other Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans. While detained in the camp, Mineta, a Boy Scout, met fellow Scout Alan K. Simpson, future U.S. Senator from Wyoming, who often visited the Scouts in the internment camp with his troop. The two became, and have remained, close friends and political allies.

==Recent history (1950–1990)==
In 1954 the National Order of the Arrow Conference was held at the University of Wyoming.

==Boy Scouts of America in Wyoming today==

There are four Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils in Wyoming.

===Black Hills Area Council===
Black Hills Area Council serves Scouts in South Dakota and Wyoming. Black Hills Area Council is headquartered in Rapid City, South Dakota.

===Adventure West Council===

In May 2021 Greater Wyoming Council merged with Longs Peak Council to form the Adventure West Council. Spanning over half of the state of Wyoming, the &quot;Greater Wyoming Council&quot; (Central Wyoming Council before 2016) provides service for boys from age 8 to 21. Greater Wyoming Council is headquartered in Casper, Wyoming.

====Organization====
The Council is composed of seven Districts.

* Bighorn
* Frontier
* Golden Plains
* Shoshone
* Thunder Basin
* Tri-Trails
* Wapiti
====Camps====

Camp Buffalo Bill lies seven miles east of the East Gate of Yellowstone National Park in the Shoshone National Forest. The camp is ideal for troops wishing to have both a Scout camp experience and tour the nation&#x27;s first national park. Camp Buffalo Bill is also the home of the Yellowstone High Adventure Outpost, a high adventure program where scouts can participate in one of four core areas: Trek, Climbing, Paddlesports, and Winter.

===Grand Teton Council===
Grand Teton Council is the result of a merger between the Tendoy Area Council and Idaho Falls Council, and serves Scouts in both Idaho and Wyoming.

===Trapper Trails Council===
The Trapper Trails Council is headquartered in Ogden, Utah. Trapper Trails Council was formed from a merger between Jim Bridger Council, Lake Bonneville Council and Cache Valley Area Council, and serves Scouts in southwestern Wyoming, southern Idaho, and northern Utah.

==Girl Scouting in Wyoming==
The Girl Scouts of Montana and Wyoming with headquarters in Billings, Montana serves Wyoming. There is a service center in Casper, Wyoming as well as several camps.

<doc id="102989" wikidata="Q146691" url="?curid=102989" title="Alphonse Mucha">
<text>Alfons Maria Mucha (; 24 July 1860 – 14 July 1939), known internationally as Alphonse Mucha, was a Czech painter, illustrator, and graphic artist. Living in Paris during the Art Nouveau period, he was widely known for his distinctly stylized and decorative theatrical posters, particularly those of Sarah Bernhardt. He produced illustrations, advertisements, decorative panels, as well as designs, which became among the best-known images of the period.

In the second part of his career, at the age of 57, he returned to his homeland and devoted himself to a series of twenty monumental symbolist canvases known as &quot;The Slav Epic&quot;, depicting the history of all the Slavic peoples of the world, which he painted between 1912 and 1926. In 1928, on the 10th anniversary of the independence of Czechoslovakia, he presented the series to the Czech nation. He considered it his most important work.

==Early life==
Mucha was born on 24 July 1860 in the small town of Ivančice in southern Moravia, then a province of the Austrian Empire (currently a region of the Czech Republic). His family had a very modest income; his father Ondřej was a court usher, and his mother Amálie was a miller&#x27;s daughter. Alphonse was the eldest of six children, all with names starting with &quot;A&quot;.

Alphonse showed an early talent for drawing; a local merchant impressed by his work gave him a gift of paper, at the time a luxury item. In the preschool period, he drew exclusively with his left hand. He had a talent for music: he was an alto singer and violin player. After completing Volksschule, he wanted to continue with his studies, but his family was not able to fund them, as they were already funding the studies of his three step-siblings. 

His music teacher sent him to Pavel Křížkovský, choirmaster of St Thomas&#x27;s Abbey in Brno, to be admitted to the choir and to have his studies funded by the monastery. Křížovský was impressed by his talent, but he was not able to admit and fund him, as he had just admitted another talented young musician, Leoš Janáček.

Křížovský sent him to a choirmaster of the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, who admitted him as a chorister and funded his studies at the gymnasium in Brno, where he received his secondary school education. After his voice broke, he gave up his chorister position, but played as a violinist during masses.

He became devoutly religious, and wrote later, &quot;For me, the notions of painting, going to church, and music are so closely knit that often I cannot decide whether I like church for its music, or music for its place in the mystery which it accompanies.&quot; He grew up in an environment of intense Czech nationalism in all the arts, from music to literature and painting. He designed flyers and posters for patriotic rallies.

His singing abilities allowed him to continue his musical education at the Gymnázium Brno in the Moravian capital of Brno, but his true ambition was to become an artist. He found some employment designing theatrical scenery and other decorations. In 1878 he applied to the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, but was rejected and advised to &quot;find a different career&quot;. In 1880, at the age of 19, he traveled to Vienna, the political and cultural capital of the Empire, and found employment as an apprentice scenery painter for a company that made sets for Vienna theaters. While in Vienna, he discovered the museums, churches, palaces and especially theaters, for which he received free tickets from his employer. He also discovered Hans Makart, a very prominent academic painter, who created murals for many of the palaces and government buildings in Vienna, and was a master of portraits and historical paintings in grand format. His style turned Mucha in that artistic direction and influenced his later work. He began experimenting with photography, which became an important tool in his later work.

To his misfortune, a terrible fire in 1881 destroyed the Ringtheater, the major client of his firm. Later in 1881, almost without funds, he took a train as far north as his money would take him. He arrived in Mikulov in southern Moravia, and began making portraits, decorative art and lettering for tombstones. His work was appreciated, and he was commissioned by Count Eduard Khuen Belasi, a local landlord and nobleman, to paint a series of murals for his residence at Emmahof Castle, and then at his ancestral home in the Tyrol, Gandegg Castle. The paintings at Emmahof were destroyed by fire in 1948, but his early versions in small format exist (now on display at the museum in Brno). He showed his skill at mythological themes, the female form, and lush vegetal decoration. Belasi, who was also an amateur painter, took Mucha on expeditions to see art in Venice, Florence and Milan, and introduced him to many artists, including the famous Bavarian romantic painter, , who lived in Munich.

== Munich ==

Count Belasi decided to bring Mucha to Munich for formal training, and paid his tuition fees and living expenses at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. He moved there in September 1885. It is not clear how Mucha actually studied at the Munich Academy; there is no record of his being enrolled as a student there. However, he did become friends with a number of notable Slavic artists there, including the Czechs Karel Vítězslav Mašek and Ludek Marold and the Russian Leonid Pasternak, father of the famous poet and novelist Boris Pasternak. 

He founded a Czech students&#x27; club, and contributed political illustrations to nationalist publications in Prague. In 1886, he received a notable commission for a painting of the Czech patron saints Cyril and Methodius, from a group of Czech emigrants, including some of his relatives, who had founded a Roman Catholic church in the town of Pisek, North Dakota. He was very happy with the artistic environment of Munich: he wrote to friends, &quot;Here I am in my new element, painting. I cross all sorts of currents, but without effort, and even with joy. Here, for the first time, I can find the objectives to reach which used to seem inaccessible.&quot; However, he found he could not remain forever in Munich; the Bavarian authorities imposed increasing restrictions upon foreign students and residents. Count Belasi suggested that he travel either to Rome or to Paris. With Belasi&#x27;s financial support, he decided in 1887 to move to Paris.

==Studies and first success in Paris==
Mucha moved to Paris in 1888 where he enrolled in the and the following year, 1889, Académie Colarossi. The two schools taught a wide variety of different styles. His first professors at the Académie Julian were Jules Lefebvre who specialized in female nudes and allegorical paintings, and Jean-Paul Laurens, whose specialties were historical and religious paintings in a realistic and dramatic style. At the end of 1889, as he approached the age of thirty, his patron, Count Belasi, decided that Mucha had received enough education and ended his subsidies.

When he arrived in Paris, Mucha found shelter with the help of the large Slavic community. He lived in a boarding house called the Crémerie at 13 rue de la Grande Chaumière, whose owner, Charlotte Caron, was famous for sheltering struggling artists; when needed she accepted paintings or drawings in place of rent. Mucha decided to follow the path of another Czech painter he knew from Munich, Ludek Marold, who had made a successful career as an illustrator for magazines. In 1890 and 1891, he began providing illustrations for the weekly magazine &quot;La Vie populaire&quot;, which published novels in weekly segments. His illustration for a novel by Guy de Maupassant, called &quot;The Useless Beauty&quot;, was on the cover of 22 May 1890 edition. He also made illustrations for &quot;Le Petit Français Illustré&quot;, which published stories for young people in both magazine and book form. For this magazine he provided dramatic scenes of battles and other historic events, including a cover illustration of a scene from the Franco-Prussian War which was on the cover of the 23 January 1892 edition.

His illustrations began to give him a regular income. He was able to buy a harmonium to continue his musical interests, and his first camera, which used glass-plate negatives. He took pictures of himself and his friends, and also regularly used it to compose his drawings. He became friends with Paul Gauguin, and shared a studio with him for a time when Gauguin returned from Tahiti in the summer of 1893. In late autumn 1894, he also became friends with the playwright August Strindberg, with whom he had common interests in philosophy and mysticism.

His magazine illustrations led to book illustration; he was commissioned to provide illustrations for &quot;Scenes and Episodes of German History&quot; by the historian Charles Seignobos. Four of his illustrations, including one depicting the death of Frederic Barbarossa, were chosen for display at the 1894 Paris Salon of Artists. He received a medal of honor, his first official recognition.

Mucha added another important client in the early 1890s; the Central Library of Fine Arts, which specialized in the publication of books about art, architecture, and the decorative arts. It later launched a new magazine in 1897 called &quot;Art et Decoration&quot;, which played an early and important role in publicizing the Art Nouveau style. Mucha continued to publish illustrations for his other clients, including for a children&#x27;s book of poetry by Eugène Manuel and for a magazine of the theater arts called &quot;La Costume au théâtre&quot;.

==Sarah Bernhardt and &quot;Gismonda&quot;==

At the end of 1894, Mucha&#x27;s career took a dramatic and unexpected turn when he began to work for the French stage actress Sarah Bernhardt. As Mucha later described it, on 26 December, Bernhardt made a telephone call to Maurice de Brunhoff, the manager of the publishing firm Lemercier, which printed her theatrical posters, ordering a new poster for the continuation of the play &quot;Gismonda&quot;. The play, by Victorien Sardou, had already opened with great success on 31 October 1894 at the Théâtre de la Renaissance on the Boulevard Saint-Martin. Bernhardt decided to have a poster made to advertise the prolongation of the theatrical run after the Christmas break, insisting it be ready by 1 January 1895. Because of the holidays, none of the regular Lemercier artists was available.

When Bernhardt called, Mucha happened to be at the publishing house correcting proofs. He already had experience painting Bernhardt; he had made a series of illustrations of her performing in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; for &quot;Le Costume au Théâtre&quot; in 1890. When &quot;Gismonda&quot; opened in October 1894, Mucha had been commissioned by the magazine &quot;Le Gaulois&quot; to make a series of illustrations of Bernhardt in the role for a special Christmas supplement, which was published at Christmas 1894, for the high price of fifty centimes per copy.

Brunhoff asked Mucha to quickly design the new poster for Bernhardt. The poster was more than life-size; a little more than two meters high, with Bernhardt in the costume of a Byzantine noblewoman, dressed in an orchid headdress and a floral stole, and holding a palm branch in the Easter procession near the end of the play. One of the innovative features of the poster was the ornate rainbow-shaped arch behind the head, almost like a halo, which focused attention on her face; this feature appeared in all of Mucha&#x27;s future theater posters. Probably because of a shortage of time, some areas of the background were left blank, without his usual decoration. The only background decoration was the Byzantine mosaic tiles behind her head. The poster featured extremely fine draftsmanship and delicate pastel colors, unlike the typical brightly colored posters of the time. The top of the poster, with the title, was richly composed and ornamented, and balanced the bottom, where the essential information was given in the shortest possible form: just the name of the theater.

The poster appeared on the streets of Paris on 1 January 1895 and caused an immediate sensation. Bernhardt was pleased by the reaction; she ordered four thousand copies of the poster in 1895 and 1896, and gave Mucha a six-year contract to produce more. With his posters all over the city, Mucha found himself quite suddenly famous.

Following &quot;Gismonda&quot;, Bernhardt switched to a different printer, F. Champenois, who, like Mucha, was put under contract to work for Bernhardt for six years. Champenois had a large printing house on Boulevard Saint Michel that employed three hundred workers, with twenty steam presses. He gave Mucha a generous monthly salary in exchange for the rights to publish all his works. With his increased income, Mucha was able to move to a three-bedroom apartment with a large studio inside a large historic house at 6 rue du Val-de-Grâce originally built by François Mansart.

Mucha designed posters for each successive Bernhardt play, beginning with a reprise of one of her early great successes, &quot;La Dame aux Camelias&quot; (September 1896), followed by &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot; (1896); &quot;Medea&quot; (1898); &quot;La Tosca&quot; (1898) and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1899). He sometimes worked from photographs of Bernhardt, as he did for &quot;La Tosca&quot;. In addition to posters, he designed theatrical programs, sets, costumes, and jewelry for Bernhardt. The enterprising Bernhardt set aside a certain number of printed posters of each play to sell to collectors.

==Commercial art and posters==
The success of the Bernhardt posters brought Mucha commissions for advertising posters. He designed posters for JOB cigarette papers, Ruinart Champagne, Lefèvre-Utile biscuits, Nestlé baby food, Idéal Chocolate, the Beers of the Meuse, Moët-Chandon champagne, Trappestine brandy, and Waverly and Perfect bicycles. With Champenois, he also created a new kind of product, a decorative panel, a poster without text, purely for decoration. They were published in large print runs for a modest price. The first series was &quot;The Seasons&quot;, published in 1896, depicting four different women in extremely decorative floral settings representing the seasons of the year. In 1897 he produced an individual decorative panel of a young woman in a floral setting, called &quot;Reverie&quot;, for Champenois. He also designed a calendar with a woman&#x27;s head surrounded by the signs of the zodiac. The rights were resold to Léon Deschamps, the editor of the arts review &quot;La Plume&quot;, who brought it out with great success in 1897. &quot;The Seasons&quot; series was followed by &quot;The Flowers&quot;, &quot;The Arts&quot; (1898), &quot;The Times of Day&quot; (1899), &quot;Precious Stones&quot; (1900), and &quot;The Moon and the Stars&quot; (1902). Between 1896 and 1904 Mucha created over one hundred poster designs for Champenois. These were sold in various formats, ranging from expensive versions printed on Japanese paper or vellum, to less expensive versions which combined multiple images, to calendars and postcards.

His posters focused almost entirely on beautiful women in lavish settings with their hair usually curling in arabesque forms and filling the frame. His poster for the railway line between Paris and Monaco-Monte-Carlo (1897) did not show a train or any identifiable scene of Monaco or Monte-Carlo; it showed a beautiful young woman in a kind of reverie, surrounded by swirling floral images, which suggested the turning wheels of a train.

The fame of his posters led to success in the art world; he was invited by Deschamps to show his work in the &quot;Salon des Cent&quot; exhibition in 1896, and then, in 1897, to have a major retrospective in the same gallery showing 448 works. The magazine &quot;La Plume&quot; made a special edition devoted to his work, and his exhibition traveled to Vienna, Prague, Munich, Brussels, London, and New York, giving him an international reputation.

==Decorative panels==
==1900 Paris Universal Exposition==
The Paris Universal Exposition of 1900, famous as the first grand showcase of the Art Nouveau, gave Mucha an opportunity to move in an entirely different direction, toward the large-scale historical paintings which he had admired in Vienna. It also allowed him to express his Czech patriotism. His foreign name had caused much speculation in the French press, which distressed him. Sarah Bernhardt stood up on his behalf, declaring in &quot;La France&quot; that Mucha was &quot;a Czech from Moravia not only by birth and origin, but also by feeling, by conviction and by patriotism.&quot; He applied to the Austrian government and received a commission to create murals for the Pavilion of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Exposition. This pavilion displayed examples of industry, agriculture, and culture of these provinces, which in 1878, by the Treaty of Berlin, had been taken away from Turkey and put under the tutorship of Austria. The temporary building built for the Exposition had three large halls with two levels, with a ceiling more than twelve meters high, and with natural light from skylights. Mucha&#x27;s experience in theater decoration gave him the ability to paint large-scale paintings in a short period of time.

Mucha&#x27;s original concept was a group of murals depicting the suffering of the Slavic inhabitants of the region caused by the occupation by foreign powers. The sponsors of the exhibit, the Austrian government, the new occupier of the region, declared that this was a little pessimistic for a World&#x27;s Fair. He changed his project to depict a future society in the Balkans where Catholic and Orthodox Christians and Muslims lived in harmony together; this was accepted, and he began work. Mucha immediately departed for the Balkans to make sketches of Balkan costumes, ceremonies, and architecture, which he put into his new work. His decoration included one large allegorical painting, &quot;Bosnia Offers Her Products to the Universal Exposition&quot;, and an additional set of murals on three walls, showing the history and cultural development of the region. He did discreetly include some images of the sufferings of the Bosnians under foreign rule, which appear in the arched band at the top of the mural. As he had done with his theater work, he often took photographs of posed models and painted from them, simplifying the forms. Whereas the work depicted dramatic events, the overall impression that it gave was one of serenity and harmony. In addition to the murals, Mucha also designed a menu for the restaurant of the Bosnia Pavilion.

His work appeared in many forms at the Exposition. Besides the posters for the official Austrian participation in the Exposition and the menu for the restaurant at the Bosnian pavilion and for the official opening banquet, he also produced displays for the jeweler Georges Fouquet and the perfume maker Houbigant, with statuettes and panels of women depicting the scents of rose, orange blossom, violet, and buttercup. His more serious artworks, including his drawings for &quot;Le Pater&quot;, were shown in the Austrian Pavilion and in the Austrian section of the Grand Palais.

His work at the Exposition earned him the title of Knight of the Order of Franz Joseph from the Austrian government, and he was named to the Legion of Honour by the French government. During the course of the Exposition, Mucha proposed another unusual project. The French Government planned to take down the Eiffel Tower, built especially for the Exposition, as soon as the event ended. Mucha proposed that, after the Exposition, the top of the tower should be replaced by a sculptural monument to humanity constructed on the pedestal. However, the tower proved to be popular with both tourists and Parisians, and it was left in its original form after the Exhibit ended.
==Jewelry and collaboration with Fouquet==
Mucha&#x27;s many interests included jewelry. His 1902 book &quot;Documents Decoratifs&quot; contained plates of elaborate designs for brooches and other pieces, with swirling arabesques and vegetal forms, and incrustations of enamel and colored stones. In 1899, he collaborated with the jeweler Georges Fouquet to make a bracelet for Sarah Bernhardt in the form of a serpent, made of gold and enamel, similar to the costume jewelry Bernhardt had worn in &quot;Medea&quot;. According to Jiri Mucha, this bracelet was created to conceal Bernhardt&#x27;s arthritic wrist. The spiraling design of the snake is a nod to Mucha&#x27;s swirling Art Nouveau painting style. The Cascade pendant designed for Fouquet by Mucha (1900) is in the form of a waterfall, composed of gold, enamel, opals, tiny diamonds, paillons, and a &quot;barocco&quot; or misshapen pearl. After the 1900 Exposition, Fouquet decided to open a new shop at 6 Rue Royale, across the street from the restaurant Maxim&#x27;s. He asked Mucha to design the interior.

The centerpieces of the design were two peacocks, the traditional symbol of luxury, made of bronze and wood with colored glass decoration. To the side was a shell-shaped fountain, with three gargoyles spouting water into basins, surrounding the statue of a nude woman. The salon was further decorated with carved moldings and stained glass, thin columents with vegetal designs, and a ceiling with molded floral and vegetal elements. It marked a summit of Art Nouveau decoration.

The Salon opened in 1901, just as tastes were beginning to change, moving away from Art Nouveau to more naturalistic patterns. It was taken apart in 1923, and a replaced by a more traditional shop design. Fortunately most of the original decoration was preserved, and was donated in 1914 and 1949 to the Carnavalet Museum in Paris, where it can be seen today.
==&quot;Documents Decoratifs&quot; and teaching==
Mucha&#x27;s next project was a series of seventy-two printed plates of watercolors of designs, titled &quot;Documents Decoratifs&quot;, which were published in 1902 by the Librarie Centrale des Beaux-arts. They represented ways that floral, vegetal and natural forms could be used in decoration and decorative objects. In about 1900 he had begun to teach at the Academy Colarossi, where he himself had been a student when he first arrived in Paris. His course was precisely described in the catalog: &quot;The object of the Mucha course is to permit the student to have the necessary knowledge for artistic decoration, applied to decorative panels, windows, porcelain, enamels, furniture, jewelry, posters, etc.&quot;
==&quot;Le Pater&quot;==
Mucha made a considerable income from his theatrical and advertising work, but he wished even more to be recognized as a serious artist and philosopher. He was a devoted Catholic, but also was interested in mysticism. In January 1898 he joined the Paris masonic lodge of the &quot;Grand Orient de France&quot;. Shortly before the 1900 Exposition, as he wrote in his memoirs, &quot;I had not found any real satisfaction in my old kind of work. I saw that my way was to be found elsewhere, little bit higher. I sought a way to spread the light which reached further into even the darkest corners. I didn&#x27;t have to look for very long. The &quot;Pater Noster&quot; (Lord&#x27;s Prayer): why not give the words a pictorial expression?&quot;. He approached his publisher, Henri Piazza, and proposed 
the book, in these words: &quot;First a cover page with symbolist ornament; then the same ornament developed in a kind a variation on each line of the prayer; a page explaining each line in a calligraphic form; and a page rendering the idea of each line in the form of an image.&quot;

&quot;Le Pater&quot; was published on 20 December 1899, only 510 copies were printed. The original watercolor paintings of the page were displayed in the Austrian pavilion at the 1900 Exposition. He considered &quot;Le Pater&quot; to be his printed masterpiece, and referred to it in the &quot;New York Sun&quot; of 5 January 1900 as a work into which he had &quot;put his soul&quot;. Critic Charles Masson, who reviewed it for &quot;Art et Decoration&quot;, wrote: &quot;There is in that man a visionary; it is the work of an imagination not suspected by those who only know his talent for the agreeable and charming.&quot;

==American travels and marriage==
In March 1904, Mucha sailed for New York and the beginning of his first visit to the United States. His intent was to find funding for his grand project, &quot;The Slav Epic&quot;, which he had conceived during the 1900 Exposition. He had letters of introduction from Baroness Salomon de Rothschild. When he landed in New York, he was already a celebrity in the United States; his posters had been widely displayed during Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s annual American tours since 1896. He rented a studio near Central Park, in New York, made portraits, and gave interviews and lectures. He also made contact with Pan-Slavic organizations. At one Pan-Slavic banquet in New York City, he met Charles Richard Crane, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist, who was a passionate Slavophile. He commissioned Mucha to make a portrait of his daughter in a traditional Slavic style. More importantly, he shared Mucha&#x27;s enthusiasm for a series of monumental paintings on Slavic history, and he became Mucha&#x27;s most important patron. When Mucha designed the Czechoslovak bills, he used his portrait of Crane&#x27;s daughter as the model for Slavia for the 100 koruna bill. 

From New York, he wrote to his family in Moravia: &quot;You must have been very surprised by my decision to come to America, perhaps even amazed. But in fact I had been preparing to come here for some time. It had become clear to me that that I would never have time to do the things I wanted to do if I did not get away from the treadmill of Paris, I would be constantly bound to publishers and their whims...in America, I don&#x27;t expect to find wealth, comfort, or fame for myself, only the opportunity to do some more useful work.&quot;

He still had commissions to complete in France, and returned to Paris at the end of May 1904. He finished his commissions and returned to New York in early January 1905, and made four more trips between 1905 and 1910, usually staying for five to six months. In 1906, he returned to New York with his new wife, (Marie/Maria) Chytilová, whom he had married on 10 June 1906, in Prague. He remained in the U.S. until 1909. Their first child, their daughter Jaroslava, was born in New York in 1909. Their son Jiří Mucha would be born in Prague in 1915.

His principal income in the United States came from teaching; he taught illustration and design at the New York School of Applied Design for Women, at the Philadelphia School of Art for five weeks, and became a visiting professor at the Art Institute of Chicago. He rejected most commercial proposals, but accepted one proposal in 1906 to design boxes and a store display for &quot;Savon Mucha&quot;, a soap bar. In 1908, he undertook one large decoration project, for the interior of the German Theater of New York; he produced three large allegorical murals, in the Art Nouveau style, representing Tragedy, Comedy and Truth. Besides the decoration, he made graphic designs, stage and costume designs.

Artistically, the trip was not a success; portrait painting was not his strong point, and the German Theater closed in 1909, one year after it opened. He made posters for the American actress Mrs. Leslie Carter (known as &#x27;The American Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;) and the Broadway star Maude Adams, but they were largely echoes of his Bernhardt posters. His finest work in America is often considered to be his portrait of Josephine Crane Bradley, the daughter of his patron, in the character of Slavia, in Slavic costume and surrounded by symbols from Slavic folklore and art. His contact with Crane made possible his most ambitious artistic project, the Slav Epic.
==Move to Prague and &quot;The Slav Epic&quot; (1910–1928)==

During his long stay in Paris, Mucha had never given up his dream of being a history painter, and to illustrate accomplishments of the Slavic peoples of Europe. He completed his plans for the &quot;Slav Epic&quot; in 1908 and 1909, and in February 1910, Charles Crane agreed to fund the project. In 1909, he had been offered a commission to paint murals on the interior of the new city hall of Prague. He made the decision to return to his old country, still then part of the Austrian Empire. He wrote to his wife, &quot;I will be able to do something really good, not just for the art critic but for our Slav souls.&quot;

His first project in 1910 was the decoration of the reception room of the mayor of Prague. This quickly became controversial, because local Prague artists resented the work being given to an artist they considered an outsider. A compromise was reached, whereby he decorated the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Hall, while the other artists decorated the other rooms. He designed and created a series of large-scale murals for the domed ceiling and walls with athletic figures in heroic poses, depicting the contributions of Slavs to European history over the centuries, and the theme of Slavic unity. These paintings on the ceiling and walls were in sharp contrast to his Parisian work, and were designed to send a patriotic message.

The Lord Mayor&#x27;s Hall was finished in 1911, and Mucha was able to devote his attention to what he considered his most important work; &quot;The Slav Epic&quot;, a series of large paintings illustrating the achievements of the Slavic peoples over history. The series had twenty paintings, half devoted to the history of the Czechs, and ten to other Slavic peoples (Russians, Poles, Serbs, Hungarians, Bulgarians, and the Balkans, including the Orthodox monasteries of Mount Athos. The canvases were enormous; the finished works measured six by eight meters. To paint them he rented an apartment and a studio in the Zbiroh Castle in western Bohemia, where he lived and worked until 1928.

While living in Paris Mucha had imagined the series as &quot;light shining into the souls of all people with its clear ideals and burning warnings.&quot; To prepare the project he traveled to all the Slavic countries, from Russia and Poland to the Balkans, making sketches and taking photographs. He used costumed models and still and motion picture cameras to set the scenes, often encouraging the models to create their own poses. He used egg tempera paint, which, according to his research, was quicker-drying and more luminous, and would last longer.

He created the twenty canvases between 1912 and 1926. He worked throughout the First World War, when the Austrian Empire was at war with France, despite wartime restrictions, which made canvas hard to obtain. He continued his work after the war ended, when the new Czechoslovak Republic was created. The cycle was completed in 1928 in time for the tenth anniversary of the proclamation of the Czechoslovak Republic.

Under the conditions of his contract he donated his work to the city of Prague in 1928. The &quot;Slav Epic&quot; was shown in Prague twice in his lifetime, in 1919 and 1928. After 1928 it was rolled up and put into storage.

From 1963 until 2012 the series was on display in the chateau in Moravský Krumlov in the South Moravian Region in the Czech Republic. In 2012 the series was put on display at the National Gallery&#x27;s Veletržní Palace in Prague. In 2021 it was announced that a new, permanent home would be found for the paintings in central Prague, to be completed in 2026.

While he was working on the &quot;Slav Epic&quot;, he also did work for the Czech government. In 1918, he designed the korun bank note, with the image of Slavia, the daughter of his American patron Charles Crane. He also designed postage stamps for his new country. He declined commercial work, but did make occasional posters for philanthropic and cultural events, such as the Lottery of the Union of Southwestern Moravia, and for Prague cultural events.

===Making of &quot;The Slav Epic&quot;===
 
==Last years and death==
In the political turmoil of the 1930s, Mucha&#x27;s work received little attention in Czechoslovakia. However, in 1936 a major retrospective was held in Paris at the &quot;Jeu de Paume&quot; museum, with 139 works, including three canvases from the Slav Epic.

Hitler and Nazi Germany began to threaten Czechoslovakia in the 1930s. Mucha began work on a new series, a triptych depicting the Age of Reason, the Age of Wisdom and the Age of Love, which he worked on from 1936 to 1938, but never completed. On 15 March 1939, the German army paraded through Prague, and Hitler, at Prague castle, declared lands of the former Czechoslovakia to be part of the Greater German Reich as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Mucha&#x27;s role as a Slav nationalist and Freemason made him a prime target. He was arrested, interrogated for several days, and released. By then his health was broken. He contracted pneumonia and died on 14 July 1939, 10 days short of his 79th birthday and over a month before the outbreak of the Second World War. Though public gatherings were banned, a huge crowd attended his interment in the Slavín Monument of Vyšehrad cemetery, reserved for notable figures in Czech culture.

==Legacy==
Mucha was and remains widely known for his Art Nouveau work, which frustrated him. According to his son and biographer, Jiří Mucha, he did not think much of Art Nouveau. &quot;What is it, &quot;Art Nouveau&quot;?&quot; he asked. &quot;...Art can never be new.&quot; He took the greatest pride in his work as a history painter.

Although it enjoys great popularity today, at the time of his death Mucha&#x27;s style was considered outdated. His son, author Jiří Mucha, devoted much of his life to writing about him and bringing attention to his artwork. In his own country, the new authorities were not interested in Mucha. &quot;The Slav Epic&quot; was rolled and stored for twenty-five years before being shown in Moravský Krumlov. The National Gallery in Prague now displays &quot;The Slav Epic&quot;, and has a major collection of Mucha&#x27;s work.

Mucha is also credited with restoring the movement of Czech Freemasonry.

The Mucha Museum, the only museum dedicated to the artist, opened in Prague in 1998.

One of the largest collections of Mucha&#x27;s works is that of nine-year World No. 1 professional tennis player Ivan Lendl, who started collecting his works upon meeting Jiří Mucha in 1982. His collection was exhibited publicly for the first time in 2013 in Prague.

<text>William James Murray (born September 21, 1950) is an American actor and comedian, known for his deadpan delivery in roles ranging from studio comedies to independent dramas.

Murray became a national presence on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1977 to 1980, receiving a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series. He established his stardom by acting in a string of successful comedy films, including &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979), &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980), &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), &quot;Scrooged&quot; (1988), &quot;Quick Change&quot; (1990) and &quot;What About Bob?&quot; (1991). He also had supporting roles in &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986), &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), &quot;Kingpin&quot; (1996) and &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot; (2001). Murray also starred as Dr. Peter Venkman in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), and &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989) and has reprised his role in various projects within the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; franchise.

Murray&#x27;s performance in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993) earned him critical acclaim and roles in more serious films. He began his collaboration with director Wes Anderson with &quot;Rushmore&quot; (1998), which earned him an Independent Spirit Award. He went on to appear in many of Anderson&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001), &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007), &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009), &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; (2012), &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014), &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; (2018) and &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; (2021). He starred in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003), earning him Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Other notable films roles include &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; (2005), &quot;City of Ember&quot; (2008), &quot;Hyde Park on Hudson&quot; (2012), &quot;The Monuments Men&quot; (2014), &quot;Rock the Kasbah&quot; (2015) and &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023).

For his role in the HBO miniseries &quot;Olive Kitteridge&quot; (2014), he earned his second Primetime Emmy Award. In 2016, Murray was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.

==Early life==
Murray was born on September 21, 1950, in Evanston, Illinois, to Lucille, a mail room clerk, and Edward J. Murray, a lumber salesman. He attended an all-boys Jesuit school in Wilmette, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago.

Murray and his eight siblings grew up in an Irish Catholic family. His paternal grandfather was from County Cork, while his maternal ancestors were from County Galway. Three of his siblings, John Murray, Joel Murray and Brian Doyle-Murray, are also actors. A sister, Nancy, is an Adrian Dominican nun in Michigan; she has traveled the United States in two one-woman programs, portraying Catherine of Siena and Dorothy Stang. His brother Ed Murray died in 2020. Their father died in 1967 at the age of 46 from complications of diabetes when Bill was 17.

As a youth, Murray read children&#x27;s biographies of American heroes like Kit Carson, Wild Bill Hickok and Davy Crockett. He attended St. Joseph&#x27;s grade school and Loyola Academy. During his teen years, he worked as a golf caddy to fund his education at the Jesuit high school, was the lead singer of a rock band (the Dutch Masters) and took part in high school and community theater. One of his sisters had polio and his mother suffered several miscarriages.

After graduating from Loyola Academy, Murray attended Regis University in Denver, Colorado, taking pre-medical courses, but quickly dropped out and returned to Illinois. In 2007, Regis awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. On September 21, 1970, his 20th birthday, the police arrested Murray at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare Airport for trying to smuggle of cannabis, which he had allegedly intended to sell. It was discovered after Murray joked to the passenger next to him that he had packed a bomb in his luggage. Murray was convicted and sentenced to probation.

==Career==
=== 1970s: Early work ===
Second City, National Lampoon

With an invitation from his older brother Brian, Murray got his start at Chicago&#x27;s The Second City, an improvisational comedy troupe, studying under Del Close. In 1974, he moved to New York City and was recruited by John Belushi as a featured player on &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot;.

&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1977–1980)

In 1975, the Off-Broadway &quot;The National Lampoon Show&quot; led to his first television role as a cast member of the ABC variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot;. That same season, another variety show, &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;, premiered. Cosell&#x27;s show lasted just one season, canceled in early 1976. After working in Los Angeles with the &quot;guerrilla video&quot; commune TVTV on several projects, Murray rose to prominence in 1976. He officially joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the show&#x27;s second season, following the departure of Chevy Chase. Murray was with &quot;SNL&quot; for three seasons from 1977 to 1980. A &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot; sketch Monty Python&#x27;s Eric Idle brought for his appearance on &quot;SNL&quot; developed into the mockumentary &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978). Murray appeared as &quot;Bill Murray the K&quot;, a send-up of New York radio host Murray the K, in a segment that parodies the Maysles Brothers&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit&quot;. During the first few seasons of &quot;SNL&quot;, Murray was in a romantic relationship with fellow cast member Gilda Radner.

===1980s: Work with Harold Ramis===

Murray landed his first starring role with &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979). He followed this with a portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson in &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; (1980). In the early 1980s, he collaborated with writer-director Harold Ramis and starred in a string of box-office hits, including &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980) and &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981) and had a role in &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982). Murray was the first guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; on February 1, 1982. He later appeared on the first episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on August 30, 1993, when the show moved to CBS. On January 31, 2012, 30 years after his first appearance with Letterman, Murray appeared again on his talk show. He appeared as Letterman&#x27;s final guest when the host retired on May 20, 2015.

Murray began work on a film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;. The film, which Murray co-wrote, was his first starring role in a drama. He later agreed with Columbia Pictures to star in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;—in a role originally written for John Belushi—to get financing for &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; became the highest-grossing film of 1984 and, at the time, the highest-grossing comedy ever. &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, which was filmed before &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was released, was a box-office flop.

Disappointed over the failure of &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, Murray took a hiatus from acting for four years to study philosophy and history at Sorbonne University, frequent the Cinémathèque in Paris, and to spend time with his family in their Hudson River Valley home. During that time, his second son, Luke, was born. With the exception of a cameo in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986), he made no film appearances, but participated in public readings in Manhattan organized by playwright-director Timothy Mayer and in a stage production of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;A Man&#x27;s a Man&quot;. Murray returned to film with &quot;Scrooged&quot; (1988) and &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989).

=== 1990s ===
Murray made his first and only attempt at directing when he co-directed &quot;Quick Change&quot; (1990) with producer Howard Franklin. He co-starred in Frank Oz&#x27;s &quot;What About Bob?&quot; (1991) alongside Richard Dreyfuss. He starred in Harold Ramis&#x27;s fantasy comedy &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993). &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Hal Hinson praised Murray&#x27;s performance: &quot;Murray is a breed unto himself, a sort of gonzo minimalist. And he&#x27;s never been funnier as a comedian or more in control as an actor than he is here. It&#x27;s easily his best movie.&quot; That same year, he starred in the comedy &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot; alongside Robert De Niro and Uma Thurman. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The great satisfaction of &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot; is watching Mr. De Niro and Mr. Murray play against type with such invigorating ease.&quot;

After the success of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, Murray appeared in a series of well-received supporting roles in films like Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994) and Peter Farrelly&#x27;s &quot;Kingpin&quot; (1996). Also in 1996, he appeared as himself in the Looney Tunes live action comedy &quot;Space Jam&quot; with Michael Jordan. However, his starring roles in &quot;Larger than Life&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Little&quot; (1997) were not as successful with critics or audiences. He received much critical praise for his role in Wes Anderson&#x27;s coming of age comedy &quot;Rushmore&quot; (1998), opposite Jason Schwartzman and Olivia Williams. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Murray turns in a thrillingly knowing, unforced performance — an award-worthy high point in a career that continues&quot;. Murray received the Best Supporting Actor awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (tying with Billy Bob Thornton for &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;). Murray then took on more dramatic roles in &quot;Wild Things&quot; (1998) and &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1999).

=== 2000s ===
Murray decided to take a turn towards more dramatic roles and experienced a resurgence in his career. In 2000, he portrayed Polonius in Michael Almereyda&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, based on the play by William Shakespeare. The film starred Ethan Hawke in the title role, as well as Kyle MacLachlan, Julia Stiles, Liev Schreiber and Sam Shepard. The film received mixed reviews. The following year, Murray reunited with Wes Anderson in the family comedy-drama &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001) which starred Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Anjelica Huston. In the film, Murray plays Raleigh St. Clair, the meek and mild-mannered neurologist, writer, and husband of Margot Tenenbaum (Paltrow).
In 2003, he starred in his first collaboration with director Sofia Coppola in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; opposite Scarlett Johansson. Murray plays an aging movie star on assignment in Tokyo to shoot a Suntory whiskey commercial. Feeling isolated and alone he meets an American woman, Charlotte (Johansson) with whom he sparks an unlikely friendship. Coppola explores the themes of alienation and disconnection against a backdrop of cultural displacement in Japan. The independent drama was an immense critical success and commercial success. Roger Ebert hailed Murray&#x27;s performance: &quot;Bill Murray has never been better. He doesn&#x27;t play &#x27;Bill Murray&#x27; or any other conventional idea of a movie star, but invents Bob Harris from the inside out, as a man both happy and sad with his life – stuck, but resigned to being stuck.&quot; Murray earned numerous accolades, including the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, and the Independent Spirit Award, as well as Best Actor awards from several film critic organizations. He was considered a favorite to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, but Sean Penn ultimately won the award for his performance in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Mystic River&quot;. In an interview included on the &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; DVD, Murray states that it is his favorite film in which he has appeared. He played himself &quot;hiding out&quot; in a local coffee shop in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot; (2003). He voiced Garfield in &quot;&quot; (2004), which role he reprised in &quot;&quot; (2006). Murray later said that he only took the role because he was under the mistaken impression that the screenplay, co-written by Joel Cohen, was the work of Joel Coen.

He made his third collaboration with Anderson in &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), co-written by Anderson with Noah Baumbach. Murray plays Zissou, an oceanographer-filmmaker based on Jacques Cousteau who is struggling to finish his latest documentary and has to reconcile with his son (Owen Wilson). The film also stars Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Anjelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum and Michael Gambon. The film initially received mixed reviews, although Murray&#x27;s performance was praised, and was a box office bomb. In the decades since, it has developed a cult following. The following year, Murray reunited with Jim Jarmusch in &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; (2005). The film revolves around Don Johnston (Murray), who embarks on a journey to four women (Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton), to find out who sent him a mysterious letter. Roger Ebert praised Murray: &quot;No actor is better than Bill Murray at doing nothing at all, and being fascinating while not doing it&quot;. That same year, Murray announced that he was taking a hiatus from acting as he had not had the time to relax since his new breakthrough in the late 1990s.

He returned to the big screen for cameos in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007) and Peter Segal&#x27;s &quot;Get Smart&quot; (2008). He played an important role in the post-apocalyptic film &quot;City of Ember&quot; (2008). Murray starred in the independent film &quot;Get Low&quot; (2009) alongside Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek. The film is loosely based on a true story about a Tennessee hermit in the 1930s who throws his own funeral party while still alive. Murray and Duvall received critical praise and the film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. Also in 2009, Murray played himself in the zombie comedy &quot;Zombieland&quot; starring Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg. Murray voiced Mr. Badger in Anderson&#x27;s stop-motion film &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009).

=== 2010s ===

Murray starred in Roger Michell&#x27;s historical comedy &quot;Hyde Park on Hudson&quot; (2012), where he played Franklin D. Roosevelt opposite Laura Linney, (Roosevelt&#x27;s cousin Margaret Suckley) and Olivia Williams (Eleanor Roosevelt). The film focuses on the 1939 visit at the Roosevelts&#x27; Hyde Park home by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (Samuel West and Olivia Colman, respectively.) Murray received praise from critics; Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Bill Murray wouldn&#x27;t be my first thought for an actor to play President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but he may have been the right choice for &quot;Hyde Park on Hudson.&quot; The role requires him to show Roosevelt as a sometimes lonely and sad man whose vacation getaway is his mother&#x27;s family mansion, Springwood, near Hyde Park in upstate New York ... Murray, who has a wider range than we sometimes realize, finds the human core of this FDR and presents it tenderly.&quot; Murray received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination for his performance.

Since 2010, Murray has continued to appear in Wes Anderson films, including the coming of age comedy &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; (2012) which also starred Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton. The film premiered at the 65th Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the . The film was a box office and critical success. In 2016, the BBC included the film in its list of greatest films of the twenty-first century. Murray made a brief comic turn in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014). The film competed at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival where it received rapturous reviews. The film received 9 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, ultimately receiving 4, for Costume Design, Production Design, Makeup/Hair and Original Score. Murray, along with the cast, won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture for his ensemble work.

Murray, along with Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville, Jean Dujardin and Bob Balaban, starred in George Clooney&#x27;s ensemble World War II drama &quot;The Monuments Men&quot; (2014). The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a modest box office success. Murray starred in the coming of age film &quot;St. Vincent&quot; (2014) alongside Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts. Murray played Vincent, a retired, grumpy, alcoholic Vietnam War veteran, and received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his performance. Peter Bradshaw&#x27;s mixed review praised Murray: &quot;[He] knows how to shine as the bleary, cynical companion to a younger person dragooned by fate into being both his pupil and his accomplice, and who puts Murray back in touch with his own innocence.&quot; He starred as a music manager in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Kasbah&quot; (2015).

He voiced Baloo in Jon Favreau&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016). Murray received praise for his comic performance with Chris Nashawaty of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; describing him at &quot;his wry, what-me-worry comic-relief best&quot;. The film was an immense financial hit, and earned a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Murray was nominated for Favorite Animated Movie Voice at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards; he lost to Ellen DeGeneres who reprised her role in &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016).
There had been speculation that Murray might return to the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; franchise for a rumored &quot;Ghostbusters 3&quot;. Murray once stated, &quot;I&#x27;d do it only if my character was killed off in the first reel,&quot; and also, &quot;You know, maybe I should just do it. Maybe it&#x27;d be fun to do.&quot; Eventually, he appeared in both the 2016 &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; reboot as Martin Heiss, a cynical ghost debunker, which was released on July 15, 2016, and 2021&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.
In 2018, Murray returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; portraying Donald Trump&#x27;s White House&#x27;s Chief strategist Steve Bannon alongside Fred Armisen as journalist and author Michael Wolff. That year he was also part of Wes Anderson&#x27;s ensemble cast of the animated film &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot;, which premiered at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival. He also briefly reprised his role as himself in &quot;&quot; (2018).

Murray was part of the ensemble cast of Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s zombie-comedy &quot;The Dead Don&#x27;t Die&quot; (2019). The film starred Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, Selena Gomez, Chloë Sevigny and Steve Buscemi. The film received mixed reviews. However John Nungent of &quot;Empire&quot; praised its lead performances: &quot;Murray and Driver are two of Jarmusch&#x27;s favourite muses — the De Niro and DiCaprio to his Scorsese, if you like — and few actors capture that lacksadasical sense of humour quite as well as them, both faces almost Buster Keaton-esque in their deadpan resolve.&quot;

=== 2020s ===
Murray reprised his role in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; for an ad which aired during the 2020 Super Bowl. In it, he steals the groundhog and drives him to various places in the orange Jeep Gladiator. Murray reunited with Sofia Coppola for the comedy-drama &quot;On the Rocks&quot; (2020) opposite Rashida Jones. The film premiered at the 58th New York Film Festival where it received positive reviews, with many critics praising Murray&#x27;s performance. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that &quot;Murray has seldom been better.&quot; It had a limited theatrical release on October 2, 2020, by A24, followed by a digital streaming release on October 23, 2020, on Apple TV+. He received some critical acclaim as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Murray appeared in a small role in &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; (2021), reuniting him with Wes Anderson for the 9th time. It was set to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 2020, and get a wide release on July 24, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival was cancelled and the film was pulled from the schedule on April 3, 2020. The film was rescheduled for release on October 16, 2020, before being pulled from the schedule again on July 23, 2020. It ultimately premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and was released on October 22, 2021.

==Other work==

Murray is a partner with his brothers in Murray Bros. Caddy Shack, a restaurant with two locations. In 2001, they opened a location at the World Golf Village near St. Augustine, Florida. The second location opened in 2018, inside the Crowne Plaza Rosemont Hotel near the O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

In 1978, Murray appeared in two at-bats for the Grays Harbor Loggers Minor League Baseball team, credited with one hit and a lifetime batting average of .500.

He founded and was part-owner of the St. Paul Saints, a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. Bill occasionally traveled to Saint Paul, Minnesota to watch the team&#x27;s games. Murray sold his interest in the Saints in 2023. As part of the Goldklang Group, he owns or owned part of the Charleston RiverDogs, the Hudson Valley Renegades, and the Brockton Rox. He has invested in a number of other minor league teams in the past, including the Utica Blue Sox, the Fort Myers Miracle, the Salt Lake Sting (APSL), the Catskill Cougars, and the Salt Lake City Trappers.

In 2022, Murray recited poetry and sang with the cellist Jan Vogler, in a recorded production of &quot;New Worlds: The Cradle of Civilization&quot;, which was released in cinemas.

== Public image ==
Murray&#x27;s popularity has been such that he holds an iconic status in American popular culture. Murray&#x27;s eccentric style of comedy, both on-screen and in his personal life, has caused him to be seen as a folk hero to many making him a significant meme in various media including books and the Internet. In 2016 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the Kennedy Center. Roger Ebert writes that &quot;The Murray persona has become familiar without becoming tiring: The world is too much with him, he is a little smarter than everyone else, he has a detached melancholy, he is deeply suspicious of joy, he sees sincerity as a weapon that can be used against him, and yet he conceals emotional needs. He is Hamlet in a sitcom world.&quot;

==Personal life==

Being very detached from the Hollywood scene, Murray does not have an agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has reportedly prevented him from participating in films such as &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot;, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;. When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s not that hard. If you have a good script that&#x27;s what gets you involved. People say they can&#x27;t find me. Well, if you can write a good script, that&#x27;s a lot harder than finding someone. I don&#x27;t worry about it; it&#x27;s not my problem.&quot;

Murray has homes in Los Angeles; Rancho Santa Fe, California; Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts; Charleston, South Carolina; and Palisades, New York. Between 2008 and 2013, Murray maintained a residence in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.

In 2007, Murray was pulled over by Swedish police on suspicion of driving a golf cart under the influence of alcohol.

Murray has experienced symptoms of depression. He has claimed that art and music have helped ease past depressive episodes.

He is a student of the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff.

Murray is the godfather to Wes Anderson&#x27;s daughter, Freya.

During the filming of &quot;Stripes&quot;, Murray married Margaret Kelly on January 25, 1981. Later, they remarried in Chicago for their families. Margaret gave birth to two sons, Homer and Luke. Following Murray&#x27;s affair with Jennifer Butler, the couple divorced in 1996. 

In 1997, he married Butler. Together, they have four sons: Caleb, Jackson, Cooper, and Lincoln. Butler filed for divorce on May 12, 2008, accusing Murray of domestic violence, infidelity, and addictions to sex, marijuana, and alcohol. Their divorce was finalized on June 13, 2008. 

Butler died on January 19, 2021.

=== Chicago sports and other activities ===
Murray is a fan of several Chicago professional sports teams, especially the Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bears, and the Chicago Bulls. He was once a guest color commentator for a Cubs game during the 1980s. He was in attendance, along with fellow Cubs fans John Cusack, Eddie Vedder, and Bonnie Hunt, during the Cubs&#x27; historic Game Seven victory during the 2016 World Series. Murray is an avid Quinnipiac University basketball fan, where his son served as head of basketball operations, and he is a regular fixture at home games. He cheered courtside for the Illinois Fighting Illini&#x27;s game against the 2004–2005 Arizona Wildcats in the Regional Final game in Chicago. He is a fixture at home games of those teams when in his native Chicago. After traveling to Florida during the Cubs&#x27; playoff run to help &quot;inspire&quot; the team (Murray joked with Cubs slugger Aramis Ramírez he was very ill and needed two home runs to give him the hope to live), he was invited to the champagne party in the Cubs&#x27; clubhouse when the team clinched the NL Central in late September 2007, along with fellow actors John Cusack, Bernie Mac, James Belushi, and former Cubs player Ron Santo. Murray appears in Santo&#x27;s documentary, &quot;This Old Cub&quot;. In 2006, Murray became the sixth recipient of Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s annual Hilda Award, established in 2001 &quot;to recognize distinguished service to the game by a fan&quot;. He sang &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; during a 2016 World Series game at Wrigley Field.

As a Chicago native, Murray appeared at the 50th annual Chicago Air &amp; Water Show in August 2008. He performed a tandem jump with the U.S. Army Parachute Team Golden Knights. He was the MC for Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival on July 28, 2007, where he dressed in various guises of Clapton as he appeared through the years. He served as MC again in 2010 and once more in 2019.

Murray&#x27;s son, Luke, is an assistant coach for the UConn Huskies men&#x27;s basketball team. Murray has attended several of their games, such as during their championship run in the 2023 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Murray stated in a 1984 interview: &quot;I&#x27;m definitely a religious person, but it doesn&#x27;t have much to do with Catholicism anymore. I don&#x27;t think about Catholicism as much.&quot; 

In a 2014 interview, Murray expressed affection for the Traditional Latin Mass and expressed concerns about some of the changes within the Mass of Paul VI: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure all those changes were right. I tend to disagree with what they call the new Mass. I think we lost something by losing the Latin. Now if you go to a Catholic Mass even just in Harlem it can be in Spanish, it can be in Ethiopian, it can be in any number of languages. The shape of it, the pictures, are the same but the words aren&#x27;t the same.&quot;

=== Political views ===
Murray donated $1,000 to former Governor of Nebraska Bob Kerrey&#x27;s successful election to the United States Senate in 1988. 

During the 2000 presidential campaign, Murray supported Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. 

In a 2018 interview, Murray praised the Trump tax cuts, opining them to be a &quot;great thing for the corporations&quot;.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 1987, he donated money to help build the Nathalie Salmon House, which provides affordable housing for low-income seniors. Michael and Lilo Salmon, the founders of Housing Opportunities and Maintenance for the Elderly (HOME), said Murray performed &quot;miracles&quot; for them.

==Feuds and allegations of misconduct==
Murray has been known for his mood swings, leading Dan Aykroyd to refer to him as &quot;The Murricane&quot;. Murray has said of his reputation: &quot;I remember a friend said to me a while back: &#x27;You have a reputation.&#x27; And I said: &#x27;What?&#x27; And he said: &#x27;Yeah, you have a reputation of being difficult to work with.&#x27; But I only got that reputation from people I didn&#x27;t like working with, or people who didn&#x27;t know how to work, or what work is. Jim, Wes and Sofia, they know what it is to work, and they understand how you&#x27;re supposed to treat people.&quot;

In the book &quot;Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests&quot;, Chevy Chase recalls being confronted by Murray shortly before an &quot;SNL&quot; broadcast in 1978, in which Chase had returned to guest host. The issue, likely to do with Chase&#x27;s insistence on doing the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment that had been taken over by Jane Curtin, led to Murray and Chase trading insults, with Murray telling Chase to go have sex with Jacqueline Carlin, Chase&#x27;s wife at the time, while Chase commented that Murray&#x27;s face looked &quot;like something Neil Armstrong had landed on&quot;. The argument eventually turned physical, with &quot;SNL&quot; cast members Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman, and Gilda Radner witnessing the altercation. Murray later said of the incident, &quot;It was an Oedipal thing, a rupture. Because we all felt mad he had left us, and somehow I was the anointed avenging angel, who had to speak for everyone. But Chevy and I are friends now. It&#x27;s all fine.&quot; The two went on to star together in &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, which was shot the following year.

According to &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, Murray did not get along well with Sean Young during the production of &quot;Stripes&quot; and has refused to work with her again.

According to Robert Schnakenberg&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;The Big Bad Book of Bill Murray&quot;, Murray had a &quot;disastrous meeting&quot; with Nick Nolte that caused both of them to turn down &quot;About Last Night&quot; (1986).

Murray has said in interviews that he and film director Richard Donner did not get along well while filming &quot;Scrooged&quot;, stating that they would disagree with each other. Donner said of Murray: &quot;He&#x27;s superbly creative, but occasionally difficult – as difficult as any actor.&quot;

Both Murray and Richard Dreyfuss have confirmed in separate interviews that they did not get along with each other during the making of &quot;What About Bob?&quot; In addition, the film&#x27;s producer Laura Ziskin recalled having a disagreement with Murray that led him to toss her into a lake. Ziskin confirmed in 2003, &quot;Bill also threatened to throw me across the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot. I was furious and outraged at the time, but having produced a dozen movies, I can safely say it is not common behavior.&quot; Dreyfuss later alleged in 2019 that Murray screamed at him while he was intoxicated and told him, &quot;Everyone hates you! You are tolerated!&quot; and then threw an ashtray at him. Although they have not crossed paths since the release of the film, Dreyfuss confirmed in a 2020 interview that he has forgiven Murray.

Murray also had a falling out with film director and longtime collaborator Harold Ramis during the production of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. According to screenwriter Danny Rubin, &quot;They were like two brothers who weren&#x27;t getting along.&quot; Apparently, they had such intense creative differences that one day Ramis grabbed Murray by the shirt collar and threw him against a wall. As a result, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; ultimately served as the final film collaboration between Murray and Ramis, although they did take part in 2009&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Murray eventually reconciled with Ramis just before Ramis&#x27; death in February 2014.

During the making of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Lucy Liu allegedly threw punches at Murray after he told her that she could not act. Murray claims, however, that he and Liu had only an argument rather than a feud and that they have &quot;made peace&quot; since then. Film director McG, who directed &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, alleged in 2009 that Murray headbutted him. Murray has denied ever doing so.

&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; director Sofia Coppola said that the central scene of Scarlett Johansson and Murray lying on the bed together took multiple takes because the actors did not seem to be getting along. She eventually stopped for the day and started again the next morning. Despite this, Coppola stated that Murray was a lot of fun to work with on the production.

Anjelica Huston recalled having a feud with Murray during the making of &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;.

In August 2018, photographer Peter Simon alleged that Murray physically harassed him at a Martha&#x27;s Vineyard restaurant.

In April 2022, production of &quot;Being Mortal&quot; was suspended after Murray was accused of unspecified &quot;inappropriate behavior&quot;. It was later reported in October that Murray had allegedly straddled a female production assistant and kissed or rubbed her on the mouth while the pair were wearing flu masks as part of COVID-19 protocols. The woman filed a complaint and received a settlement of $100,000 from Murray,&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/murray-kissed-straddled&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline/1235013728/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and signed a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon/2023/06/07/hollywood&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2022, Geena Davis alleged in her memoir &quot;Dying of Politeness&quot; that Murray harassed and yelled at her during the filming of &quot;Quick Change&quot; and that, during their first meeting in a hotel suite, he had pressured her to let him use a massage machine on her back&quot;.&quot; She also recalled a dual interview on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; during which Murray repeatedly tried to pull down the spaghetti strap of her dress. That same month, Seth Green alleged that when he was nine years old, backstage on the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; set, Murray picked him up from a chair by his ankles and dangled him over a garbage can, before Green fell in after accidentally striking Murray in the testicles. Rob Schneider has also alleged that Murray &quot;absolutely hated&quot; Adam Sandler and Chris Farley when Murray returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a guest host.

Murray has been defended by longtime collaborator Wes Anderson amid the misconduct claims.

<text>Scouting in Iowa has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910–1960)==
Scouting began in Jewell, Iowa, due to the generosity of Mrs. Carrie A. Strong. Mrs. Strong had resided in Jewell and moved to California, but due to her interest in the town even after relocation, she gave the town of Jewell its first step in Scouting. In 1916, Mrs. Strong came back to Jewell for her annual visit went before the city fathers to tell them that she would provide the fund to buy and build a Scout House on, and give $1000 to construct a building suitable for the Scout program.

A parcel of land was bought from H. K. and Christian Gronbeck on October 14, 1916, for the sum of $840.00. The building was let to Peterson Builders for the Scout House 240 by 48 feet and 12 foot high. The completed cost for the building was $935.00. The First Scoutmaster was Reverend Norstad and his assistants were professors from the then . F. H. Ferbitz became Scoutmaster in October 1923 with 28 Scouts under his leadership. A Fife and Drum Corp was also started at that time and the grounds were cleaned and the building painted. A basketball league was formed which consisted of four teams. After the basketball games, the boys would have what they referred to as, &quot;a feed.&quot; These feeds were paid for by the continued contributions of Mrs. Strong up to the time of her death on November 27, 1923.

<doc id="102999" wikidata="Q28995" url="?curid=102999" title="Collective unconscious">
<text>Collective unconsciousness () refers to the unconscious mind and shared mental concepts. It is generally associated with idealism and was coined by Carl Jung. According to Jung, the human collective unconscious is populated by instincts, as well as by archetypes: ancient primal symbols such as The Great Mother, the Wise Old Man, the Shadow, the Tower, Water, and the Tree of Life. Jung considered the collective unconscious to underpin and surround the unconscious mind, distinguishing it from the personal unconscious of Freudian psychoanalysis. He believed that the concept of the collective unconscious helps to explain why similar themes occur in mythologies around the world. He argued that the collective unconscious had a profound influence on the lives of individuals, who lived out its symbols and clothed them in meaning through their experiences. The psychotherapeutic practice of analytical psychology revolves around examining the patient&#x27;s relationship to the collective unconscious.

Psychiatrist and Jungian analyst Lionel Corbett argues that the contemporary terms &quot;autonomous psyche&quot; or &quot;objective psyche&quot; are more commonly used today in the practice of depth psychology rather than the traditional term of the &quot;collective unconscious&quot;. Critics of the collective unconscious concept have called it unscientific and fatalistic, or otherwise very difficult to test scientifically (due to the mystical aspect of the collective unconscious). Proponents suggest that it is borne out by findings of psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology.

== Basic explanation ==
The term &quot;collective unconscious&quot; first appeared in Jung&#x27;s 1916 essay, &quot;The Structure of the Unconscious&quot;. This essay distinguishes between the &quot;personal&quot;, Freudian unconscious, filled with sexual fantasies and repressed images, and the &quot;collective&quot; unconscious encompassing the soul of humanity at large.

In &quot;The Significance of Constitution and Heredity in Psychology&quot; (November 1929), Jung wrote:
On October 19, 1936, Jung delivered a lecture &quot;The Concept of the Collective Unconscious&quot; to the Abernethian Society at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. He said:

Jung linked the collective unconscious to &quot;what Freud called &#x27;archaic remnants&#x27; – mental forms whose presence cannot be explained by anything in the individual&#x27;s own life and which seem to be aboriginal, innate, and inherited shapes of the human mind&quot;. He credited Freud for developing his &quot;primal horde&quot; theory in &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; and continued further with the idea of an archaic ancestor maintaining its influence in the minds of present-day humans. Every human being, he wrote, &quot;however high his conscious development, is still an archaic man at the deeper levels of his psyche.&quot;

As modern humans go through their process of individuation, moving out of the collective unconscious into mature selves, they establish a persona—which can be understood simply as that small portion of the collective psyche which they embody, perform, and identify with.

The collective unconscious exerts overwhelming influence on the minds of individuals. These effects of course vary widely, however, since they involve virtually every emotion and situation. At times, the collective unconscious can terrify, but it can also heal.

== Archetypes ==

In an early definition of the term, Jung writes: &quot;Archetypes are typical modes of apprehension, and wherever we meet with uniform and regularly recurring modes of apprehension we are dealing with an archetype, no matter whether its mythological character is recognized or not.&quot; He traces the term back to Philo, Irenaeus, and the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, which associate archetypes with divinity and the creation of the world, and notes the close relationship of Platonic ideas.

These archetypes dwell in a world beyond the chronology of a human lifespan, developing on an evolutionary timescale. Regarding the animus and anima, the male principle within the woman and the female principle within the man, Jung writes:

Jung also described archetypes as imprints of momentous or frequently recurring situations in the lengthy human past.

A complete list of archetypes cannot be made, nor can differences between archetypes be absolutely delineated. For example, the Eagle is a common archetype that may have a multiplicity of interpretations. It could mean the soul leaving the mortal body and connecting with the heavenly spheres, or it may mean that someone is sexually impotent, in that they have had their spiritual ego body engaged. In spite of this difficulty, Jungian analyst June Singer suggests a partial list of well-studied archetypes, listed in pairs of opposites:
Jung made reference to contents of this category of the unconscious psyche as being similar to Levy-Bruhl&#x27;s use of &quot;collective representations&quot; or &quot;représentations collectives&quot;, Mythological &quot;motifs&quot;, Hubert and Mauss&#x27;s &quot;categories of the imagination&quot;, and Adolf Bastian&#x27;s &quot;primordial thoughts&quot;. He also called archetypes &quot;dominants&quot; because of their profound influence on mental life.

== Instincts ==
Jung&#x27;s exposition of the collective unconscious builds on the classic issue in psychology and biology regarding nature versus nurture. If we accept that nature, or heredity, has some influence on the individual psyche, we must examine the question of how this influence takes hold in the real world.

On exactly one night in its entire lifetime, the yucca moth discovers pollen in the opened flowers of the yucca plant, forms some into a pellet, and then transports this pellet, with one of its eggs, to the pistil of another yucca plant. This activity cannot be &quot;learned&quot;; it makes more sense to describe the yucca moth as experiencing intuition about how to act. Archetypes and instincts coexist in the collective unconscious as interdependent opposites, Jung would later clarify. Whereas for most animals intuitive understandings completely intertwine with instinct, in humans the archetypes have become a separate register of mental phenomena.

Humans experience five main types of instinct, wrote Jung: hunger, sexuality, activity, reflection, and creativity. These instincts, listed in order of increasing abstraction, elicit and constrain human behavior, but also leave room for freedom in their implementation and especially in their interplay. Even a simple hungry feeling can lead to many different responses, including metaphorical sublimation. These instincts could be compared to the &quot;drives&quot; discussed in psychoanalysis and other domains of psychology. Several readers of Jung have observed that in his treatment of the collective unconscious, Jung suggests an unusual mixture of primordial, &quot;lower&quot; forces, and spiritual, &quot;higher&quot; forces.

== Exploration ==

Jung believed that proof of the existence of a collective unconscious, and insight into its nature, could be gleaned primarily from dreams and from active imagination, a waking exploration of fantasy.

Jung considered that &#x27;the shadow&#x27; and the anima and animus differ from the other archetypes in the fact that their content is more directly related to the individual&#x27;s personal situation&#x27;. These archetypes, a special focus of Jung&#x27;s work, become autonomous personalities within an individual psyche. Jung encouraged direct conscious dialogue of the patients with these personalities within. While the shadow usually personifies the personal unconscious, the anima or the Wise Old Man can act as representatives of the collective unconscious.

Jung suggested that parapsychology, alchemy, and occult religious ideas could contribute understanding of the collective unconscious. Based on his interpretation of synchronicity and extra-sensory perception, Jung argued that psychic activity transcended the brain. In alchemy, Jung found that plain water, or seawater, corresponded to his concept of the collective unconscious.

In humans, the psyche mediates between the primal force of the collective unconscious and the experience of consciousness or dream. Therefore, symbols may require interpretation before they can be understood as archetypes. Jung writes:

A single archetype can manifest in many different ways. Regarding the Mother archetype, Jung suggests that not only can it apply to mothers, grandmothers, stepmothers, mothers-in-law, and mothers in mythology, but to various concepts, places, objects, and animals:

Care must be taken, however, to determine the meaning of a symbol through further investigation; one cannot simply decode a dream by assuming these meanings are constant. Archetypal explanations work best when an already-known mythological narrative can clearly help to explain the confusing experience of an individual.

== Evidence ==
In his clinical psychiatry practice, Jung identified mythological elements which seemed to recur in the minds of his patients—above and beyond the usual complexes which could be explained in terms of their personal lives. The most obvious patterns applied to the patient&#x27;s parents: &quot;Nobody knows better than the psychotherapist that the mythologizing of the parents is often pursued far into adulthood and is given up only with the greatest resistance.&quot;

Jung cited recurring themes as evidence of the existence of psychic elements shared among all humans. For example: &quot;The snake-motif was certainly not an individual acquisition of the dreamer, for snake-dreams are very common even among city-dwellers who have probably never seen a real snake.&quot; Still better evidence, he felt, came when patients described complex images and narratives with obscure mythological parallels. Jung&#x27;s leading example of this phenomenon was a paranoid-schizophrenic patient who could see the sun&#x27;s dangling phallus, whose motion caused wind to blow on earth. Jung found a direct analogue of this idea in the &quot;Mithras Liturgy&quot;, from the Greek Magical Papyri of Ancient Egypt—only just translated into German—which also discussed a phallic tube, hanging from the sun, and causing wind to blow on earth. He concluded that the patient&#x27;s vision and the ancient Liturgy arose from the same source in the collective unconscious.

Going beyond the individual mind, Jung believed that &quot;the whole of mythology could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious&quot;. Therefore, psychologists could learn about the collective unconscious by studying religions and spiritual practices of all cultures, as well as belief systems like astrology.

=== Criticism of Jung&#x27;s evidence ===

Popperian critic Ray Scott Percival disputes some of Jung&#x27;s examples and argues that his strongest claims are not falsifiable. Percival takes special issue with Jung&#x27;s claim that major scientific discoveries emanate from the collective unconscious and not from unpredictable or innovative work done by scientists. Percival charges Jung with excessive determinism and writes: &quot;He could not countenance the possibility that people sometimes create ideas that cannot be predicted, even in principle.&quot; Regarding the claim that all humans exhibit certain patterns of mind, Percival argues that these common patterns could be explained by common environments (i.e. by shared nurture, not nature). Because all people have families, encounter plants and animals, and experience night and day, it should come as no surprise that they develop basic mental structures around these phenomena.

This latter example has been the subject of contentious debate, and Jung critic Richard Noll has argued against its authenticity.

=== Ethology and biology ===

Animals all have some innate psychological concepts which guide their mental development. The concept of imprinting in ethology is one well-studied example, dealing most famously with the Mother constructs of newborn animals. The many predetermined scripts for animal behavior are called innate releasing mechanisms.

Proponents of the collective unconscious theory in neuroscience suggest that mental commonalities in humans originate especially from the subcortical area of the brain: specifically, the thalamus and limbic system. These centrally located structures link the brain to the rest of the nervous system and are said to control vital processes including emotions and long-term memory .

=== Archetype research ===

A more common experimental approach investigates the unique effects of archetypal images. An influential study of this type, by Rosen, Smith, Huston, &amp; Gonzalez in 1991, found that people could better remember symbols paired with words representing their archetypal meaning. Using data from the Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism and a jury of evaluators, Rosen et al. developed an &quot;Archetypal Symbol Inventory&quot; listing symbols and one-word connotations. Many of these connotations were obscure to laypeople. For example, a picture of a diamond represented &quot;self&quot;; a square represented &quot;Earth&quot;. They found that even when subjects did not consciously associate the word with the symbol, they were better able to remember the pairing of the symbol with its chosen word. Brown &amp; Hannigan replicated this result in 2013, and expanded the study slightly to include tests in English and in Spanish of people who spoke both languages.

Maloney (1999) asked people questions about their feelings to variations on images featuring the same archetype: some positive, some negative, and some non-anthropomorphic. He found that although the images did not elicit significantly different responses to questions about whether they were &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;pleasant&quot;, but did provoke highly significant differences in response to the statement: &quot;If I were to keep this image with me forever, I would be&quot;. Maloney suggested that this question led the respondents to process the archetypal images on a deeper level, which strongly reflected their positive or negative valence.

Ultimately, although Jung referred to the collective unconscious as an &quot;empirical&quot; concept, based on evidence, its elusive nature does create a barrier to traditional experimental research. June Singer writes: 
== Application to psychotherapy ==
Psychotherapy based on analytical psychology would seek to analyze the relationship between a person&#x27;s individual consciousness and the deeper common structures which underlie them. Personal experiences both activate archetypes in the mind and give them meaning and substance for individual. At the same time, archetypes covertly organize human experience and memory, their powerful effects becoming apparent only indirectly and in retrospect. Understanding the power of the collective unconscious can help an individual to navigate through life.

In the interpretation of analytical psychologist Mary Williams, a patient who understands the impact of the archetype can help to dissociate the underlying symbol from the real person who embodies the symbol for the patient. In this way, the patient no longer uncritically transfers their feelings about the archetype onto people in everyday life, and as a result, can develop healthier and more personal relationships.

Practitioners of analytic psychotherapy, Jung cautioned, could become so fascinated with manifestations of the collective unconscious that they facilitated their appearance at the expense of their patient&#x27;s well-being. Individuals with schizophrenia, it is said, fully identify with the collective unconscious, lacking a functioning ego to help them deal with actual difficulties of life.

== Application to politics and society ==
Elements from the collective unconscious can manifest among groups of people, who by definition all share a connection to these elements. Groups of people can become especially receptive to specific symbols due to the historical situation they find themselves in. The common importance of the collective unconscious makes people ripe for political manipulation, especially in the era of mass politics. Jung compared mass movements to mass psychoses, comparable to demonic possession in which people uncritically channel unconscious symbolism through the social dynamic of the mob and the leader.

Although civilization leads people to disavow their links with the mythological world of uncivilized societies, Jung argued that aspects of the primitive unconscious would nevertheless reassert themselves in the form of superstitions, everyday practices, and unquestioned traditions such as the Christmas tree.

Based on empirical inquiry, Jung felt that all humans, regardless of racial and geographic differences, share the same collective pool of instincts and images, though these manifest differently due to the moulding influence of culture. However, above and in addition to the primordial collective unconscious, people within a certain culture may share additional bodies of primal collective ideas.

Jung called the UFO phenomenon a &quot;living myth&quot;, a legend in the process of consolidation. Belief in a messianic encounter with UFOs demonstrated the point, Jung argued, that even if a rationalistic modern ideology repressed the images of the collective unconscious, its fundamental aspects would inevitably resurface. The circular shape of the flying saucer confirms its symbolic connection to repressed but psychically necessary ideas of divinity.

The universal applicability of archetypes has not escaped the attention of marketing specialists, who observe that branding can resonate with consumers through appeal to archetypes of the collective unconscious.

== Distinction from related concepts ==
Jung contrasted the collective unconscious with the personal unconscious, the unique aspects of an individual study which Jung says constitute the focus of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler. Psychotherapy patients, it seemed to Jung, often described fantasies and dreams which repeated elements from ancient mythology. These elements appeared even in patients who were probably not exposed to the original story. For example, mythology offers many examples of the &quot;dual mother&quot; narrative, according to which a child has a biological mother and a divine mother. Therefore, argues Jung, Freudian psychoanalysis would neglect important sources for unconscious ideas, in the case of a patient with neurosis around a dual-mother image.

This divergence over the nature of the unconscious has been cited as a key aspect of Jung&#x27;s famous split from Sigmund Freud and his school of psychoanalysis. Some commentators have rejected Jung&#x27;s characterization of Freud, observing that in texts such as &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; (1913) Freud directly addresses the interface between the unconscious and society at large. Jung himself said that Freud had discovered a collective archetype, the Oedipus complex, but that it &quot;was the first archetype Freud discovered, the first and only one&quot;.

Jung also distinguished the collective unconscious and collective consciousness, between which lay &quot;an almost unbridgeable gulf over which the subject finds himself suspended&quot;. According to Jung, collective consciousness (meaning something along the lines of consensus reality) offered only generalizations, simplistic ideas, and the fashionable ideologies of the age. This tension between collective unconscious and collective consciousness corresponds roughly to the &quot;everlasting cosmic tug of war between good and evil&quot; and has worsened in the time of the mass man.

Organized religion, exemplified by the Catholic Church, lies more with the collective consciousness; but, through its all-encompassing dogma it channels and molds the images which inevitably pass from the collective unconscious into the minds of people. (Conversely, religious critics including Martin Buber accused Jung of wrongly placing psychology above transcendental factors in explaining human experience.)

==Minimal and maximal interpretations==
In a minimalist interpretation of what would then appear as &quot;Jung&#x27;s much misunderstood idea of the collective unconscious&quot;, his idea was &quot;simply that certain structures and predispositions of the unconscious are common to all of us ... [on] an inherited, species-specific, genetic basis&quot;. Thus &quot;one could as easily speak of the &#x27;collective arm&#x27; – meaning the basic pattern of bones and muscles which all human arms share in common.&quot;

Others point out however that &quot;there does seem to be a basic ambiguity in Jung&#x27;s various descriptions of the Collective Unconscious. Sometimes he seems to regard the predisposition to experience certain images as understandable in terms of some genetic model&quot; – as with the collective arm. However, Jung was &quot;also at pains to stress the numinous quality of these experiences, and there can be no doubt that he was attracted to the idea that the archetypes afford evidence of some communion with some divine or world mind&#x27;, and perhaps &#x27;his popularity as a thinker derives precisely from this&quot; – the maximal interpretation.

Marie-Louise von Franz accepted that &quot;it is naturally very tempting to identify the hypothesis of the collective unconscious historically and regressively with the ancient idea of an all-extensive world-soul.&quot; New Age writer Sherry Healy goes further, claiming that Jung himself &quot;dared to suggest that the human mind could link to ideas and motivations called the collective unconscious ... a body of unconscious energy that lives forever.&quot; This is the idea of monopsychism.

Other researchers, including Alexander Fowler, have proposed using the minimal interpretation of his work and incorporating it into that of the theory of biological evolution (i.e., sexual selection) or to unify disparate theoretical orientations within psychology such as neuropsychology, evolutionary psychology and analytical psychology as Jung&#x27;s postulation of an evidenced mechanism for the genetic transmission of information through sexual selection provides a singular explanation for unanswered questions held by those of varied theoretical orientations.

== Plot ==
In 1968 California, Sally, a loyal and conservative military wife, is married to Bob Hyde, a captain in the United States Marine Corps, who is about to be deployed to Vietnam. As a dedicated military officer, Bob sees the deployment primarily as an opportunity for career progress. At first, Sally dreads being left alone, but after a while, she feels liberated. Forced to find housing away from the base, she moves into a new apartment by the beach and buys a sports car. With nothing else to do, she decides to volunteer at a local Veterans Administration (VA) hospital, partially inspired by her bohemian friend Vi Munson, whose brother Billy has come home with grave emotional problems after just two weeks in Vietnam and now resides in the VA hospital.

At the hospital, Sally meets Luke Martin, a former high-school classmate. Like his friend Billy, Luke had gone to Vietnam but came back wounded. He is recuperating at the hospital from the injuries he sustained, which left him a paraplegic. Filled with pain, anger, and frustration, Luke is now opposed to the war. He is at first a bitter young man, but as he is increasingly thrown into contact with Sally, a relationship develops. Eventually, Luke is released from the hospital, and, newly mobile with his own wheelchair, begins to rebuild his life. His relationship with Sally deepens. She is also transformed by him, and her outlook on life starts to change. They have happy times, play at the beach, and fall in love. Meanwhile, Billy, traumatized by his experiences at war, commits suicide by injecting air into his veins. Driven by Billy&#x27;s suicide, Luke chains himself to the gates of a local recruitment center in a vain attempt to stop others from enlisting.

Sally and Luke eventually make love, confronting his handicap, with Sally experiencing her first orgasm. However, she does not seek a divorce from her husband, and both she and Luke know that their relationship will have to end when Bob returns home. Bob does return, too soon, claiming that he had accidentally wounded himself in the leg. He is also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from what he has seen in combat. Bob discovers Sally&#x27;s affair from Army Intelligence, who has been spying on Luke since the gate incident, and Sally and Luke agree that Sally should try to patch things up with Bob. Bob loses control, confronting the lovers with a loaded rifle, but ultimately turns away. Bob places his neatly folded Marine dress uniform on the beach, takes off his wedding ring, and swims naked out into the ocean to commit suicide.

== Production ==
&quot;Coming Home&quot; was conceived by Jane Fonda as the first feature for her own production company, IPC Films (for the Indochina Peace Campaign), with her associate producer Bruce Gilbert, a friend from her protest days. Fonda wished to make a film about the Vietnam War inspired by her friendship with Ron Kovic, a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran, whom she had met at an antiwar rally. At that time, Kovic had recently completed his autobiographical book &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, which later became an Oscar-winning motion picture of the same name directed by Oliver Stone, starring Tom Cruise as Kovic.

In 1972, Fonda hired Nancy Dowd, a friend from her days in the feminist movement, to write a script about the consequences of the war as seen through the eyes of a military wife. Originally, Dowd&#x27;s story, tentatively titled &quot;Buffalo Ghosts&quot;, focused on two women, volunteers at a veterans&#x27; hospital, who must come to grips with the emotional toll that the war takes on its casualties and their families. The project dragged on for years until Gilbert and producer Jerome Hellman took it. The screenplay was reshaped significantly by the circle of talent who eventually brought it to the screen: Fonda, Ashby, Wexler, Jon Voight, producer Hellman and screenwriters Waldo Salt and Robert C. Jones. They were united by their opposition to the Vietnam War and by their concern for the veterans who were returning to America and facing difficulties adapting to life back home. Rudy Wurlitzer contributed uncredited work to the script.

John Schlesinger, who had worked with producers Hellman and Voight on &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, was originally named the director, but he left the project after feeling uncomfortable with the subject matter. The script was then passed to Michael Cimino, who at the time was interested in making another film about Vietnam. He declined, however, as he felt it was &quot;bad fiction&quot;, which imposed a political idea rather than the truth of the stories of returning veterans. According to Cimino, Fonda changed the original ending:
&quot;What was shot was Jane&#x27;s ending — she was a pacifist and had to find a way for guilt to kill the character. In the original ending, Bruce Dern&#x27;s character got himself a heavy machine gun, in a moment of madness went into the L.A. freeway, five lanes of traffic in both directions, and started shooting away, destroying everything in sight, an inferno. And she turned it into a Norman Maine complex, &#x27;oh my God I&#x27;m so guilty for what I did in Vietnam that I&#x27;m going to kill myself by going in the sea&#x27;.&quot;
Hal Ashby was next sent the script, who agreed to direct the film. Fonda was cast from the beginning as Sally Hyde, the housewife. A top box-office star was sought for the male lead to offset the grim nature of the story. Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Sylvester Stallone were all offered the part, but declined. Jon Voight had been considered for the role of the husband, but after becoming involved with the film, he campaigned to play the paraplegic veteran. Voight had participated in the anti-war movement and was a friend of Fonda, who was instrumental in helping him land the role, even though he had fallen from popularity since his &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; heyday. Bruce Dern, long stereotyped in sadistic roles, was chosen as the husband. The screenplay was written and rewritten until the project could wait no longer. Jane Fonda, who just finished &quot;Julia&quot; (1977), was soon to star in Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s &quot;Comes a Horseman&quot; (1978). For director Ashby, this was his second film about the 1960s, in addition to his 1975 film &quot;Shampoo&quot;.

Ashby had cast singer-songwriter Guthrie Thomas to portray the role of Bill Munson after reviewing Thomas&#x27; screen test. Thomas joined his close friend Ashby and the entire cast at a restaurant by Malibu Beach before the start of production. Thomas had been previously cast in a previous Ashby film, &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, starring David Carradine. Upon completion of the cast meeting, Thomas privately spoke with Ashby and told him, &quot;Hal, I am a singer-songwriter as you know, and not an actor. In all fairness to you and this amazing cast, you need an extremely talented actor for this role and not a poor singer. I recommend either Bobby Carradine or Keith Carradine.&quot; Robert Carradine was cast and portrayed the role of Bill Munson.

== Reception ==
&quot;Coming Home&quot; premiered at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, where Voight won the award for Best Actor for his performance.

The film was released in the U.S. in February 1978. It proved popular with audiences and received generally good reviews. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that: &quot;Despite an over-explicit soundtrack and some moments when the story in fact became a sermon, the movie effectively translated a changed national consciousness into credible and touching personal terms.&quot; The &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; called the film &quot;&quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; c. 1978 with the same high standards and the same lofty morals of an earlier era.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 29 reviews, with a rating average of 7.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Coming Home&quot;&#x27;s stellar cast elevates the love triangle in the center of its story - and adds a necessary human component to its none-too-subtle political message.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

He has appeared with his younger brother, actor/comedian Bill Murray, in several films, including &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, &quot;Scrooged&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, and &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;.

He also appeared in the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; as The Flying Dutchman, the Cartoon Network original animated series &quot;My Gym Partner&#x27;s a Monkey&quot; as Coach Tiffany Gills, &quot;The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack&quot; as Captain K&#x27;nuckles, a recurring role as Don Ehlert on the ABC sitcom &quot;The Middle&quot;, and Bob Kruger in the AMC dramedy &quot;Lodge 49&quot;.

Doyle-Murray has been nominated for three Emmy Awards in 1978, 1979, and 1980 for his work on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the category Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program.

His oldest brother Ed was a businessman prior to his death in 2020 and brother Andy is a chef and runs the Murray Brothers &quot;CaddyShack&quot; restaurant located in the World Golf Village resort near St. Augustine, Florida. Doyle is his grandmother&#x27;s maiden name, and he chose to hyphenate it to avoid confusion with another actor.

It was the second film adaptation of Harry Segall&#x27;s play of the same name, the first being &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (1941).

The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, with Beatty becoming the second person (after Orson Welles for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;) to be nominated for producing (Best Picture), directing (Best Director with Henry), writing (Best Adapted Screenplay with May) and acting (Best Actor) for the same film, and the film won for Best Art Direction. The cast includes Beatty, Julie Christie, and Jack Warden, all of whom had appeared in &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975).

The film was released on June 28, 1978 by Paramount Pictures, and received positive reviews from critics, while earning a total of $98.8 million against a budget of $6 million, making it a financial success.

In 2001, a third film adaptation of the play was done, titled &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, sharing its name with the sequel to &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (1941).

==Plot==
Joe Pendleton, a backup quarterback for the National Football League&#x27;s Los Angeles Rams, is looking forward to leading his team to the Super Bowl. While he is riding his bicycle through a tunnel, an overzealous guardian angel on his first assignment, known only as The Escort, sees a large truck heading into the other end of the tunnel towards Joe. The Escort plucks Joe out of his body early in the mistaken belief that Joe was about to be killed in order to save him from any suffering.

Once in the afterlife, Joe refuses to believe that his time is up, and upon investigation, Mr. Jordan (the Escort&#x27;s supervisor) discovers that Joe was going to just narrowly miss the truck and he was not destined to die until March 20, 2025, at 10:17 AM. Unfortunately, his body has already been cremated, so a new body must be found for him. After rejecting several possible men who are about to die, Joe is persuaded to accept the body of a multi-millionaire industrialist. Leo Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating gold digger wife Julia Farnsworth and her lover Tony Abbott, Leo&#x27;s personal secretary.

Julia and Tony are amazed when Leo reappears alive and well, and Leo&#x27;s domestic staff is confused by the changes in some of his habits and tastes. Still obsessed with his football destiny, Leo/Joe buys the Rams and plans to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince and then secure the help of his longtime friend and Rams trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with Betty Logan, an environmental activist, whom he met when she came to his doorstep to protest the original Leo&#x27;s corporate policies.

With the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl, all the characters face a crisis. Mr. Jordan informs Joe that he must give up Leo&#x27;s body as well. Joe resists but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else, possibly another quarterback, and should think of him. Julia and Tony continue their murderous plans, and Tony finally shoots Leo/Joe dead. The Rams are forced to start Tom Jarrett, another quarterback, in the climactic game. A detective, Lieutenant Krim, interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on television. With the help of Max, he gets Julia and Tony to incriminate each other.

After a brutal hit on the field, Tom is killed. With Mr. Jordan&#x27;s help, Joe occupies Tom&#x27;s body and leads the Rams to victory. During the team&#x27;s postgame celebration, Max finds Tom/Joe, and when he realizes that it is him, they share an emotional embrace. As Tom/Joe is being interviewed on television, Mr. Jordan tells him that, to live as Tom Jarrett, he will have to lose his memories of his life as Joe Pendleton and Leo Farnsworth. As Mr. Jordan disappears, Tom/Joe becomes disoriented. Max goes to find him later and is crestfallen to realize that Joe has &quot;left&quot; Tom.

Tom bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium. They strike up a conversation, and each appears to recognize the other, but they do not know how. The lights go out one by one in the stadium as they exit the venue, and Tom says something that reminds Betty of Leo/Joe. Looking into his eyes, Betty remembers what he said to her before and whispers &quot;You&#x27;re the quarterback.&quot; Tom asks her to go with him for coffee, and she accepts.

Several former Los Angeles Rams players have cameo roles in the film, including Deacon Jones, Les Josephson, Jack T. Snow, Jim Boeke, and Charley Cowan. Some well-known sportscasters also appear, playing familiar roles. Curt Gowdy and Al DeRogatis can be heard doing the Super Bowl play-by-play commentary. Dick Enberg conducts an abortive postgame interview of Joe Pendleton/Tom Jarrett. Beatty lobbied hard for Cary Grant to accept the role of Mr. Jordan, going so far as to have Grant&#x27;s ex-wife, Dyan Cannon, who stars as Julia Farnsworth, urge him to take the role. Although Grant was tempted, he ultimately decided not to end his retirement from film-making.

==Production==
Beatty initially wanted Muhammad Ali to play the central character, but because of Ali&#x27;s continued commitment to boxing, Beatty changed the character from a boxer to an American football player, and played the character himself. The type of instrument he played was also changed; in &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, Pendleton assays &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot; on the alto saxophone, and in the 1978 film, he plays &quot;Ciribiribin&quot; on a soprano sax. The music during the comic training scene with Joe and the servants at the Farnsworth mansion, as well as the later training session with the Rams is Handel&#x27;s Sonata No. 3 in F Major, performed by Paul Brodie (sopranino saxophone) and Antonin Kubalek (piano). The main theme is the song &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; performed by Dave Grusin and the London Symphony Orchestra. Neil Diamond composed a song titled &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; specifically for the film that he thought would be a good theme song, but Beatty declined to use it. The Paul McCartney and Wings song &quot;Did We Meet Somewhere Before?&quot; was considered as a theme song for the film, but was ruled out. It later appeared in the film &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; (1979).

The Super Bowl game (Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Rams) was filmed during halftime of the San Diego Chargers vs. Los Angeles Rams preseason game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on September 1, 1977. (About a year and a half after the film&#x27;s release, in January 1980, the Rams and Steelers met in real life in Super Bowl XIV.)

The estate used as Farnsworth mansion was filmed at Filoli, located in Woodside, California, south of San Francisco. Another filming location, albeit brief, was at Evergreen Cemetery in Los Angeles on the grounds beside the Gothic stone chapel in the scene where Joe discovers his body was cremated and scattered on the cemetery grounds.

Videotape was used for effects shots and transferred to 35mm.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads &quot;A throwback to the high-gloss screwball comedies of the 1940s, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; beguiles with seamless production values and great comic relief from Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four and called it &quot;the kind of upbeat screwball comedy Hollywood used to do smoothly and well&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half out of four and declared it &quot;a delightful film that is both surprisingly fresh and old-fashioned&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;hasn&#x27;t much personality of its own. Instead, it has a kind of earnest cheerfulness that is sometimes most winning. Mr. Beatty and Miss Christie are performers who bring to their roles the easy sort of gravity that establishes characters of import, no matter how simply they are drawn in the script.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Beatty and his accomplices have brought it off, with only minor patches of turbulence. The script has been expertly contemporized.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; is easily the most appealing new American movie on the market. It manages to preserve much of the charm and romantic fantasy that worked for its predecessor, the 1941 crowd-pleaser &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, while freshening up some of the settings and details and tailoring the roles to a different cast.&quot; Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised the script as &quot;sometimes both loopy and brainy&quot;, but asked &quot;good grief, what is all this braininess and talent doing in a remake of a Harry Segall play that has no relation to the real world we come out into from the cinema? One can see why there were films about transmigration and reincarnation during the war, but not now.&quot;

<doc id="103020" wikidata="Q171344" url="?curid=103020" title="William Hogarth">
<text>William Hogarth (; 10 November 1697 – 26 October 1764) was an English painter, engraver, pictorial satirist, social critic, editorial cartoonist and occasional writer on art. His work ranges from realistic portraiture to comic strip-like series of pictures called &quot;modern moral subjects&quot;, and he is perhaps best known for his series &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;Marriage A-la-Mode&quot;. Familiarity with his work is so widespread that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as &quot;Hogarthian&quot;.

Hogarth was born in the City of London into a lower-middle-class family. In his youth he took up an apprenticeship with an engraver, but did not complete the apprenticeship. His father underwent periods of mixed fortune, and was at one time imprisoned in lieu of payment of outstanding debts, an event that is thought to have informed William&#x27;s paintings and prints with a hard edge.

Influenced by French and Italian painting and engraving, Hogarth&#x27;s works are mostly satirical caricatures, sometimes bawdily sexual, mostly of the first rank of realistic portraiture. They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation. Charles Lamb deemed Hogarth&#x27;s images to be books, filled with &quot;the teeming, fruitful, suggestive meaning of words. Other pictures we look at; his pictures we read.&quot;

==Early life==

William Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth, a poor Latin school teacher and textbook writer, and Anne Gibbons. In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in Leicester Fields, where he learned to engrave trade cards and similar products.

Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw. Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking coffee house at St John&#x27;s Gate, was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison for five years. Hogarth never spoke of his father&#x27;s imprisonment.

In 1720, Hogarth enrolled at the original St Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy in Peter Court, London, which was run by Louis Chéron and John Vanderbank. He attended alongside other future leading figures in art and design, such as Joseph Highmore, William Kent, and Arthur Pond. However, the academy seems to have stopped operating in 1724, at around the same time that Vanderbank fled to France in order to avoid creditors. Hogarth recalled of the first incarnation of the academy: &quot;this lasted a few years but the treasurer sinking the subscription money the lamp stove etc were seized for rent and the whole affair put a stop to.&quot; Hogarth then enrolled in another drawing school, in Covent Garden, shortly after it opened in November 1724, which was run by Sir James Thornhill, serjeant painter to the king. On Thornhill, Hogarth later claimed that, even as an apprentice, &quot;the painting of St Pauls and gree[n]wich hospital ... were during this time runing in my head&quot;, referring to the massive schemes of decoration painted by Thornhill for the dome of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and Greenwich Hospital.

Hogarth became a member of the Rose and Crown Club, with Peter Tillemans, George Vertue, Michael Dahl, and other artists and connoisseurs.

==Career==

By April 1720, Hogarth was an engraver in his own right, at first engraving coats of arms and shop bills and designing plates for booksellers.

In 1727, he was hired by Joshua Morris, a tapestry worker, to prepare a design for the &quot;Element of Earth&quot;. Morris heard that he was &quot;an engraver, and no painter&quot;, and consequently declined the work when completed. Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the Westminster Court, where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728.

===Early works===
Early satirical works included an &quot;Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme&quot; (, published 1724), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720, known as the South Sea Bubble, in which many English people lost a great deal of money. In the bottom left corner, he shows Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Jewish figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is &quot;Who&#x27;l Ride&quot;. The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the South Sea Company, which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.

Other early works include &quot;The Lottery&quot; (1724); &quot;The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons&quot; (1724); &quot;A Just View of the British Stage&quot; (1724); some book illustrations; and the small print &quot;Masquerades and Operas&quot; (1724). The latter is a satire on contemporary follies, such as the masquerades of the Swiss impresario John James Heidegger, the popular Italian opera singers, John Rich&#x27;s pantomimes at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, and the exaggerated popularity of Lord Burlington&#x27;s protégé, the architect and painter William Kent. He continued that theme in 1727, with the &quot;Large Masquerade Ticket&quot;.
In 1726, Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings illustrating Samuel Butler&#x27;s &quot;Hudibras&quot;.
These he himself valued highly, and they are among his best early works, though they are based on small book illustrations.

In the following years, he turned his attention to the production of small &quot;conversation pieces&quot; (i.e., groups in oil of full-length portraits from high. Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were &quot;The Fountaine Family&quot; (), &quot;The Assembly at Wanstead House&quot;, &quot;The House of Commons examining Bambridge&quot;, and several pictures of the chief actors in John Gay&#x27;s popular &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. One of his real-life subjects was Sarah Malcolm, whom he sketched two days before her execution.

One of Hogarth&#x27;s masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The Indian Emperour, or The Conquest of Mexico by Spaniards, being the Sequel of The Indian Queen&quot; (1732–1735) at the home of John Conduitt, master of the mint, in St George&#x27;s Street, Hanover Square.

Hogarth&#x27;s other works in the 1730s include &quot;A Midnight Modern Conversation&quot; (1733), &quot;Southwark Fair&quot; (1733), &quot;The Sleeping Congregation&quot; (1736), &quot;Before&quot; and &quot;After&quot; (1736), &quot;Scholars at a Lecture&quot; (1736), &quot;The Company of Undertakers&quot; (1736), &quot;The Distrest Poet&quot; (1736), &quot;The Four Times of the Day&quot; (1738), and &quot;Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn&quot; (1738). He may also have printed &quot;Burlington Gate&quot; (1731), evoked by Alexander Pope&#x27;s Epistle to Lord Burlington, and defending Lord Chandos, who is therein satirized. This print gave great offence, and was suppressed. However, modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth.

===Moralizing art===

====&quot;Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;====
In 1731, Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to wide recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot; and appeared first as paintings (now lost) before being published as engravings. &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot; depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting – the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character&#x27;s death from venereal disease.

The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733–1735 by the sequel &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling – the character&#x27;s life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital. The original paintings of &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot; were destroyed in the fire at Fonthill House in 1755; the oil paintings of &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1733–34) are displayed in the gallery room at Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum, London, UK.

When the success of &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists&#x27; work. The result was the Engravers&#x27; Copyright Act (known as &#x27;Hogarth&#x27;s Act&#x27;), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognise the authorial rights of an individual artist.

====&quot;Marriage A-la-Mode&quot;====
In 1743–1745, Hogarth painted the six pictures of &quot;Marriage A-la-Mode&quot; (National Gallery, London), a pointed skewering of upper-class 18th-century society. An engraved version of the same series, produced by French engravers, appeared in 1745. This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials.

Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain. The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism, with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage. Hogarth here painted a satire – a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey – of a conventional marriage within the English upper class. All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form. The series, which is set in a Classical interior, shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield, the son of bankrupt Earl Squander, to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant, starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl&#x27;s grand house and ending with the murder of the son by his wife&#x27;s lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at Tyburn for murdering her husband.

William Makepeace Thackeray wrote: 

====&quot;Industry and Idleness&quot;====

In the twelve prints of &quot;Industry and Idleness&quot; (1747), Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, while the other, who is idle, commits crime and is eventually executed. This shows the work ethic of Protestant England, where those who worked hard were rewarded, such as the industrious apprentice who becomes Sheriff (plate 8), Alderman (plate 10), and finally the Lord Mayor of London in the last plate in the series. The idle apprentice, who begins &quot;at play in the church yard&quot; (plate 3), holes up &quot;in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute&quot; after turning highwayman (plate 7) and &quot;executed at Tyburn&quot; (plate 11). The idle apprentice is sent to the gallows by the industrious apprentice himself. For each plate, there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom, mostly from the Book of Proverbs, such as for the first plate:
:&quot;Industry and Idleness, shown here, &#x27;Proverbs Ch:10 Ver:4 The hand of the diligent maketh rich.&#x27;&quot;

====&quot;Beer Street&quot; and &quot;Gin Lane&quot;====
Later prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in &quot;Beer Street&quot; and &quot;Gin Lane&quot; (1751). Hogarth engraved &quot;Beer Street&quot; to show a happy city drinking the &#x27;good&#x27; beverage, English beer, in contrast to &quot;Gin Lane&quot;, in which the effects of drinking gin are shown – as a more potent liquor, gin caused more problems for society. There had been a sharp increase in the popularity of gin at this time, which was called the &#x27;Gin Craze.&#x27; It started in the early 18th century, after a series of legislative actions in the late 17th century impacted the importation and manufacturing of alcohol in London. Among these, were the Prohibition of 1678, which barred popular French brandy imports, and the forced disbandment, in 1690, of the London Guild of Distillers, whose members had previously been the only legal manufacturers of alcohol, leading to an increase in the production and then consumption of domestic gin.

In &quot;Beer Street&quot;, people are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous, while in &quot;Gin Lane&quot;, they are scrawny, lazy and careless. The woman at the front of &quot;Gin Lane&quot;, who lets her baby fall to its death, echoes the tale of Judith Dufour, who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money. The prints were published in support of the Gin Act 1751.

Hogarth&#x27;s friend, the magistrate Henry Fielding, may have enlisted Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act; &quot;Beer Street&quot; and &quot;Gin Lane&quot; were issued shortly after his work &quot;An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers, and Related Writings&quot;, and addressed the same issues.

====&quot;The Four Stages of Cruelty&quot;====

Other prints were his outcry against inhumanity in &quot;The Four Stages of Cruelty&quot; (published 21 February 1751), in which Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals which he saw around him and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner. In the first print, there are scenes of boys torturing dogs, cats and other animals. It centers around a poorly dressed boy committing a violent act of torture upon a dog, while being pleaded with to stop, and offered food, by another well-dressed boy. A boy behind them has graffitied a hanged stickman figure upon a wall, with the name &quot;Tom Nero&quot; underneath, and is pointing to this dog torturer.

The second shows Tom Nero has grown up to become a Hackney coach driver. His coach has overturned with a heavy load and his horse is lying on the ground, having broken its leg. He is beating it with the handle of his whip; its eye severely wounded. Other people around him are seen abusing their work animals and livestock, and a child is being run over by the wheel of a dray, as the drayman dozes off on the job.

In the third print, Tom is shown to be a murderer, surrounded by a mob of accusers. The woman he has apparently killed is lying on the ground, brutally slain, with a trunk and sack of stolen goods near by. One of the accusers holds a letter from the woman to Tom, speaking of how wronging her mistress upsets her conscience, but that she is resolved to do as he would have her, closing with: &quot;I remain yours till death.&quot;

The fourth, titled &quot;The Reward of Cruelty&quot;, shows Tom&#x27;s withering corpse being publicly dissected by scientists after his execution by hanging; a noose still around his neck. The dissection reflects the Murder Act 1751, which allowed for the public dissection of criminals who had been hanged for murder.

===Portraits===
Hogarth was also a popular portrait painter. In 1745, he painted actor David Garrick as Richard III, for which he was paid £200, &quot;which was more&quot;, he wrote, &quot;than any English artist ever received for a single portrait.&quot; With this picture Hogarth established the genre of theatrical portraiture as a distinctively British kind of history painting. In 1746, a sketch of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill, had an exceptional success when turned into an etching.
In 1740, he created a truthful, vivid full-length portrait of his friend, the philanthropic Captain Coram, for the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, now in the Foundling Museum. This portrait, and his unfinished oil sketch of a young fishwoman, entitled &quot;The Shrimp Girl&quot; (National Gallery, London), may be called masterpieces of British painting. There are also portraits of his wife, his two sisters, and of many other people; among them Bishop Hoadly and Bishop Herring. The engraved portrait of John Wilkes was a bestseller.

===Historical subjects===
For a long period, during the mid-18th century, Hogarth tried to achieve the status of a history painter, but did not earn much respect in this field. The painter, and later founder of the Royal Academy of Arts, Joshua Reynolds, was highly critical of Hogarth&#x27;s style and work. According to art historian David Bindman, in Dr Johnson&#x27;s serial of essays for London&#x27;s &quot;Universal Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Idler&quot;, the three essays written by Reynolds for the months of September through November 1759 are directed at Hogarth. Whereas the &quot;Idler&quot; essay no. 76, which attacks a connoisseur&#x27;s &quot;servile attention to minute exactness&quot;, seems to be more likely a response to the Hogarth supporter, Benjamin Ralph and his book, &quot;The School of Raphael&quot; (published in May 1759), in the &quot;Idler&quot; essay no. 79, Reynolds questions Hogarth&#x27;s notion of the imitation of nature as &quot;the obvious sense, that objects are represented naturally when they have such relief that they seem real.&quot; Reynolds rejected &quot;this kind of imitation&quot;, favouring the &quot;grand style of painting&quot; which avoids &quot;minute attention&quot; to the visible world. In Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Discourse XIV&quot;, he grants Hogarth has &quot;extraordinary talents&quot;, but reproaches him for &quot;very imprudently, or rather presumptuously, attempt[ing] the great historical style.&quot;

Writer, art historian and politician, Horace Walpole, was also critical of Hogarth as a history painter, but did find value in his satirical prints.

====Biblical scenes====
Hogarth&#x27;s history pictures include &quot;The Pool of Bethesda&quot; and &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot;, executed in 1736–1737 for St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital; &quot;Moses brought before Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, painted for the Foundling Hospital (1747, formerly at the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, now in the Foundling Museum); &quot;Paul before Felix&quot; (1748) at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn; and his altarpiece for St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol (1755–56).

====&quot;The Gate of Calais&quot;====
&quot;The Gate of Calais&quot; (1748; now in Tate Britain) was produced soon after his return from a visit to France. Horace Walpole wrote that Hogarth had run a great risk to go there since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.

Back home, he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies, the Frenchmen, as cringing, emaciated and superstitious people, while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives, destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority. He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate, with a &quot;soldier&#x27;s hand upon my shoulder&quot;, running him in.

===Other later works===
Notable Hogarth engravings in the 1740s include &quot;The Enraged Musician&quot; (1741), the six prints of &quot;Marriage à-la-mode&quot; (1745; executed by French artists under Hogarth&#x27;s inspection), and &quot;The Stage Coach or The Country Inn Yard&quot; (1747).

In 1745, Hogarth painted a self-portrait with his pug dog, Trump (now also in Tate Britain), which shows him as a learned artist supported by volumes of Shakespeare, Milton and Swift. In 1749, he represented the somewhat disorderly English troops on their &quot;March of the Guards to Finchley&quot; (formerly located in Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, now Foundling Museum).

Others works included his ingenious &quot;Satire on False Perspective&quot; (1754); his satire on canvassing in his &quot;Election&quot; series (1755–1758; now in Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum); his ridicule of the English passion for cockfighting in &quot;The Cockpit&quot; (1759); his attack on Methodism in &quot;Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism&quot; (1762); his political anti-war satire in &quot;The Times&quot;, plate I (1762); and his pessimistic view of all things in &quot;Tailpiece, or The Bathos&quot; (1764).

In 1757, Hogarth was appointed Serjeant Painter to the King.

===Writing===

Hogarth wrote and published his ideas of artistic design in his book &quot;The Analysis of Beauty&quot; (1753). In it, he professes to define the principles of beauty and grace which he, a real child of Rococo, saw realized in serpentine lines (the Line of Beauty). By some of Hogarth&#x27;s adherents, the book was praised as a fine deliverance upon aesthetics; by his enemies and rivals, its obscurities and minor errors were made the subject of endless ridicule and caricature. For instance, Paul Sandby produced several caricatures against Hogarth&#x27;s treatise. Hogarth wrote also a manuscript called &quot;Apology for Painters&quot; () and unpublished &quot;autobiographical notes&quot;.

===Painter and engraver of modern moral subjects===
Hogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized, being viewed in shop windows, taverns, and public buildings, and sold in printshops. Old hierarchies broke down, and new forms began to flourish: the ballad opera, the bourgeois tragedy, and especially, a new form of fiction called the novel with which authors such as Henry Fielding had great success. Therefore, by that time, Hogarth hit on a new idea: &quot;painting and engraving modern moral subjects ... to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer; my picture was my stage&quot;, as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes.

He drew from the highly moralizing Protestant tradition of Dutch genre painting, and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English broadsheet and other types of popular print. In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth. His prints were expensive, and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience.

===Parodic borrowings from Old Masters===
When analysing the work of the artist as a whole, Ronald Paulson says, &quot;In &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot;, every single plate but one is based on Dürer&#x27;s images of the story of the Virgin and the story of the Passion.&quot; In other works, he parodies Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Last Supper. According to Paulson, Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent God who intervenes in the lives of people and produces miracles. Indeed, Hogarth was a Deist, a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations. Thus, as a &quot;comic history painter&quot;, he often poked fun at the old-fashioned, &quot;beaten&quot; subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints. Hogarth also rejected Lord Shaftesbury&#x27;s then-current ideal of the classical Greek male in favour of the living, breathing female. He said, &quot;Who but a bigot, even to the antiques, will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian Venus doth but coarsely imitate.&quot;

==Personal life==

On 23 March 1729, Hogarth eloped with Jane Thornhill at Paddington Church, against the wishes of her father, the artist Sir James Thornhill.

Sir James saw the match as unequal, as Hogarth was a rather obscure artist at the time. However, when Hogarth started on his series of moral prints, &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot;, some of the initial paintings were placed either in Sir James&#x27; drawing room or dining room, through the conspiring of Jane and her mother, in the hopes of reconciling him with the couple. When he saw them, he inquired as to the artist&#x27;s name and, upon hearing it, replied: &quot;Very well; the man who can produce such representations as these, can also maintain a wife without a portion.&quot; However, he soon after relented, becoming more generous to, and living in harmony with the couple until his death.

Hogarth was initiated as a Freemason before 1728 in the Lodge at the Hand and Apple Tree Tavern, Little Queen Street, and later belonged to the Carrier Stone Lodge and the Grand Stewards&#x27; Lodge; the latter still possesses the &#x27;Hogarth Jewel&#x27; which Hogarth designed for the Lodge&#x27;s Master to wear. Today the original is in storage and a replica is worn by the Master of the Lodge. Freemasonry was a theme in some of Hogarth&#x27;s work, most notably &#x27;Night&#x27;, the fourth in the quartet of paintings (later released as engravings) collectively entitled the &quot;Four Times of the Day&quot;.

His main home was in Leicester Square (then known as Leicester Fields), but he bought a country retreat in Chiswick in 1749, the house now known as Hogarth&#x27;s House and preserved as a museum, and spent time there for the rest of his life.
The Hogarths had no children, although they fostered foundling children. He was a founding Governor of the Foundling Hospital.

Among his friends and acquaintances were many English artists and satirists of the period, such as Francis Hayman, Henry Fielding, and Laurence Sterne.

==Death==

On 25 October 1764, Hogarth was conveyed from his villa in Chiswick to his home in Leicester Fields, in weak condition. He had been in a weakened state for a while by this time, but was said to be in a cheerful mood and was even still working—with some help; doing more retouches on &quot;The Bench&quot; on this same day. On 26 October, he received a letter from Benjamin Franklin and wrote up a rough draft in reply. 

Before going to bed that evening, he had boasted about eating a pound of beefsteaks for dinner, and reportedly looked more robust than he had in a while at this time. However, when he went to bed, he suddenly began vomiting; something that caused him to ring his bell so forcefully that it broke. Hogarth died around two hours later, in the arms of his servant, Mrs Mary Lewis. John Nichols claimed that he died of an aneurysm, which he said took place in the &quot;chest.&quot; Horace Walpole claimed that he died of &quot;a dropsy of his breast.&quot;

Mrs Lewis, who stayed on with Jane Hogarth in Leicester Fields, was the only non-familial person acknowledged financially in Hogarth&#x27;s will and was left £100 (approximately £15,236.79 in 2024) for her &quot;faithful services.&quot;

Hogarth was buried at St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick, now in the west of London. His friend, actor David Garrick, composed the following inscription for his tombstone:

==Influence and reputation==
Hogarth&#x27;s works were a direct influence on John Collier, who was known as the &quot;Lancashire Hogarth&quot;. The spread of Hogarth&#x27;s prints throughout Europe, together with the depiction of popular scenes from his prints in faked Hogarth prints, influenced Continental book illustration through the 18th and early 19th centuries, especially in Germany and France. He also influenced many caricaturists of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Hogarth&#x27;s influence lives on today as artists continue to draw inspiration from his work.

Hogarth&#x27;s paintings and prints have provided the subject matter for several other works. For example, Gavin Gordon&#x27;s 1935 ballet &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, to choreography by Ninette de Valois, was based directly on Hogarth&#x27;s series of paintings of that title. Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s 1951 opera &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, with libretto by W. H. Auden, was less literally inspired by the same series. Hogarth&#x27;s engravings also inspired the BBC Radio play &quot;The Midnight House&quot; by Jonathan Hall, based on the M. R. James ghost story &quot;The Mezzotint&quot; and first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2006.

Russell Banks&#x27; short story &quot;Indisposed&quot; is a fictional account of Hogarth&#x27;s infidelity as told from the viewpoint of his wife, Jane. Hogarth was the lead character in Nick Dear&#x27;s play &quot;The Art of Success&quot;, whilst he is played by Toby Jones in the 2006 television film &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

Hogarth&#x27;s House in Chiswick, west London, is now a museum; the major road junction next to it is named the Hogarth Roundabout. In 2014 both Hogarth&#x27;s House and the Foundling Museum held special exhibitions to mark the 250th anniversary of his death.
In 2019, Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum, which owns both &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;The Humours of an Election&quot;, held an exhibition which assembled all Hogarth&#x27;s series of paintings, and his series of engravings, in one place for the first time.

Stanley Kubrick based the cinematography of his 1975 period drama film, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, on several Hogarth paintings.

In Roger Michell&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;The Mother&quot;, starring Anne Reid and Daniel Craig, the protagonists visit Hogarth&#x27;s tomb during their first outing together. They read aloud the poem inscribed there, and their shared admiration of Hogarth helps to affirm their connection with one another.

<text>Midnight Express is a 1978 prison drama film directed by Alan Parker and adapted by Oliver Stone from Billy Hayes&#x27;s 1977 memoir of the same name. The film centers on Hayes (played by Brad Davis), a young American student, who is sent to a Turkish prison for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country. The film&#x27;s title is prison slang for his escape attempt. The cast also features Irene Miracle, John Hurt, Bo Hopkins, Paul L. Smith and Randy Quaid.

Upon release, &quot;Midnight Express&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Many praised Davis&#x27;s performance as well as the cast, the writing, the direction, and the musical score by Giorgio Moroder. Hayes and others criticized the film for portraying the Turkish prison men as violent and villainous and for deviating too much from the source material.

The film was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director for Parker at the 51st Academy Awards in 1979, and won Best Adapted Screenplay for Stone and Best Original Score for Moroder. It also won six Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture – Drama and BAFTA Awards for Best Direction, Best Editing and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (for Hurt).

==Plot==
On vacation in Istanbul, Turkey, on 6 October 1970, American college student Billy Hayes straps of hashish bricks to his chest. As he and his girlfriend Susan are about to board a plane back to the US, Billy is frisked by soldiers (who are on high alert for terrorist attacks) who discover the drug. Billy is then arrested by the police and strip-searched.

A shadowy American — whom Billy nicknames &quot;Tex&quot; for his thick Texan accent — arrives and accompanies Billy to a police station and translates for him. Billy claims he bought the hashish from a taxicab driver. He offers to help police locate the driver in exchange for being released. At a nearby market, Billy points out the driver to police, who arrest him, but they have no intention of releasing Billy. He attempts to escape, only to be recaptured at gunpoint by Tex.

During his first night in Sultanahmet Jail, a freezing-cold Billy sneaks out of his cell and steals a blanket. He is later rousted from his cell and brutally beaten by chief guard Hamidou for the theft. A few days later, Billy awakens in Sağmalcılar Prison, surrounded by fellow Western prisoners Jimmy (an American who stole two candlesticks from a mosque), Max (an English heroin addict), and Erich (a Swedish drug smuggler). Jimmy warns Billy that the prison is dangerous for foreigners and says no one can be trusted, not even young children.

Billy meets with his father, a U.S. representative, and a Turkish lawyer to discuss his situation. During Billy&#x27;s trial, the prosecutor makes a case against him for drug smuggling. The lead judge is sympathetic to Billy and gives him a four-year sentence for drug possession. Billy and his father are devastated, but their Turkish lawyer insists it is a good result because the prosecutor wanted a life sentence.

Jimmy wants Billy to join an escape attempt through the prison&#x27;s subterranean tunnels. Billy, due to be released soon, declines. Jimmy goes alone and is caught, then brutally beaten. Fifty-three days before his release, Billy learns the Turkish High Court in Ankara has overturned his sentence after an appeal by the prosecution. The prosecutor who originally wanted Billy convicted of smuggling rather than the lesser charge of possession finally had his way. Billy has been resentenced to serve 30 years.

In desperation, Billy accompanies Jimmy and Max to try to escape through the catacombs below the prison. They give up after running into endless dead-ends. A particularly sycophantic prisoner, Rifki, who routinely acts as an informant in exchange for favors, notifies the guards about the escape attempt. Hamidou suspects Jimmy of being responsible for what happened during the first escape attempt. Jimmy is taken away again for punishment and is never seen again. Billy&#x27;s imprisonment becomes harsh and brutal: terrifying scenes of physical and mental torture follow one another, and Billy has a breakdown. He brutally beats Rifki, killing him. He is sent to the prison&#x27;s ward for the insane, where he wanders about in a daze among the other disturbed prisoners. Max is sent there, too. He is seen running from guards for an unknown infraction and is grabbed by Hamidou and severely injured.

In 1975, Billy&#x27;s girlfriend Susan visits him. Devastated by Billy&#x27;s condition, she tells him he must get out or die. She leaves him a scrapbook with money hidden inside to help Billy escape. Her visit strongly helps Billy to regain his senses. Billy says goodbye to an almost dead Max, telling him to stay alive and promising he&#x27;ll come back for him. Max awakens and is somewhat conscious. Billy tries to bribe Hamidou to take him to the prison hospital, but instead Hamidou forces Billy to a room, then tries to rape him. Billy becomes infuriated. They struggle until Hamidou is killed after being pushed into the wall, his head impaled upon a coat hook. Billy dons the guard&#x27;s uniform and bluffs his way with his Turkish language skills, walks out of the front door and runs to freedom.

The epilogue shows that in October 1975, Billy crossed the border to Greece and arrived home three weeks later.

==Cast==
==Production==
Although the story is set largely in Turkey, the movie was filmed almost entirely at Fort Saint Elmo in Valletta, Malta, after permission to film in Istanbul was denied. The end credits state the movie was made entirely on location in Malta. However, background shots of Istanbul were taken by a small crew pretending to be making a cigarette commercial.

A made-for-television documentary about the film, &quot;I&#x27;m Healthy, I&#x27;m Alive, and I&#x27;m Free&quot; (alternative title: &quot;The Making of Midnight Express&quot;), was released on 1 January 1978. It is seven minutes long, and features commentary from the cast and crew on how they worked together during production, and the effort it took from beginning to completion. It also includes footage from the creation of the film, and Hayes&#x27;s emotional first visit to the prison set.

==Differences from the book==
Various aspects of Billy Hayes&#x27;s story were fictionalized or added for the movie:
* In the movie, Hayes is in Turkey with his girlfriend when he is arrested. But in real life, he was traveling alone.
* Although Billy spent 17 days in the prison&#x27;s psychiatric hospital in 1972 in the book, he never bit out anyone&#x27;s tongue, which, in the film, leads to him being committed to the section for the criminally insane. In fact, he intentionally tried to be sent there, for it was considered to be an easier place to escape from.
* The book ends with Hayes being moved to İmralı prison, on an island from which he eventually escapes by stealing a dinghy, rowing in a raging storm across the Sea of Marmara, traveling by foot and by bus to Istanbul, and then crossing the border into Greece. In the film, that passage is replaced by a violent scene in which he unwittingly kills the head guard who is preparing to rape him. (In the book, Hamidou, the chief guard, was killed in 1973 by a recently paroled prisoner, who spotted him drinking tea at a café outside the prison, and shot him eight times.) The attempted rape scene itself was fictionalized; Billy never claimed in the book to have suffered any sexual violence at the hands of either his Turkish guards, wardens, or fellow inmates, but engaged in consensual homosexual activity while he was in prison. The film depicts Hayes becoming very intimate with fellow prisoner Erich the Swede, but stopping short of having sexual intercourse with him.
* There is a fleeting reference to the popular restaurant The Pudding Shop, in the bazaar. It is actually on Divan Yolu, the main avenue through historic Old Istanbul.

==Release==
The film screened at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. It opened at the Odeon Haymarket in London on Thursday, 10 August 1978 grossing $3,472 in its opening day, a Columbia Pictures record in the UK. It opened in New York on 6 October 1978 before opening nationwide in the United States on 27 October.

===Home media===
The film was first released on VHS and Betamax by Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment in 1979. It made its DVD debut in 1998. A 30th Anniversary DVD of the film was released in 2008, and a Blu-ray was released in 2009.

==Reception==
According to the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 29 reviews with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Raw and unrelenting, &quot;Midnight Express&quot; is riveting in its realistic depiction of incarceration -- mining pathos from the simple act of enduring hardship.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave &quot;Midnight Express&quot; three stars out of four in a review that concluded, &quot;The movie creates spellbinding terror, all right; my only objection is that it&#x27;s so eager to have us sympathize with Billy Hayes.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film two and a half stars out of four and called it &quot;a powerful film, but we leave the theater thinking it should have been more so. It was for that reason that I was persuaded to read the book, which is where I found the story I had been expecting to see on the screen.&quot; He also thought that Brad Davis &quot;is simply not up to the lead role. He appears unsure of himself and, like the film itself, he overacts.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Acceptance of the film depends a lot on forgetting several things,&quot; namely that Hayes was smuggling drugs. Nevertheless, he thought Davis gave &quot;a strong performance&quot; and that &quot;Alan Parker&#x27;s direction and other credits are also admirable, once you swallow the specious and hypocritical story.&quot; Charles Champlin, of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was positive, writing that the film &quot;has a kind of wailing, arid authenticity and enormous power. It is strong and uncompromising stuff, made bearable by its artistry and the saving awareness that Hayes, at least, slipped free and lived to tell the tale.&quot; Gary Arnold, of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, described the film as &quot;outrageously sensationalistic&quot; and &quot;loaded with show-stopping fabrications,&quot; and wrote of the protagonist that &quot;there&#x27;s never a compelling reason for sympathizing with the callow boy he appears to be from start to finish.&quot;

=== Allegations of Turkophobia ===
&quot;Midnight Express&quot; was also criticized for its unfavorable portrayal of Turkish people. In her 1991 book &quot;Turkish Reflections: A Biography of Place&quot;, Mary Lee Settle wrote: &quot;The Turks I saw in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Midnight Express&quot; were like cartoon caricatures, compared to the people I had known and lived among for three of the happiest years of my life.&quot; Pauline Kael, in reviewing the film for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, commented, &quot;This story could have happened in almost any country, but if Billy Hayes had planned to be arrested to get the maximum commercial benefit from it, where else could he get the advantages of a Turkish jail? Who wants to defend Turks? (They don&#x27;t even constitute enough of a movie market for Columbia Pictures to be concerned about how they are represented.)&quot; One reviewer, writing for &quot;World Film Directors&quot;, wrote: &quot;&quot;Midnight Express&quot; is &#x27;more violent, as a national hate-film than anything I can remember&#x27;, &#x27;a cultural form that narrows horizons, confirming the audience&#x27;s meanest fears and prejudices and resentments&#x27;.&quot;

David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; criticized &quot;Midnight Express&quot; as &quot;merely anti-Turkish, and hardly a defense of prisoners&#x27; rights or a protest against prison conditions.&quot; Denby said also that all Turks in the film – guardian or prisoner – were portrayed as &quot;losers&quot; and &quot;swine&quot;, and that &quot;without exception [all the Turks] are presented as degenerate, stupid slobs&quot;.

The well-known Spanish film magazine &quot;Fotogramas&quot; had this to say: &quot;One of the most sibylline exercises in racism ever produced, and one peddled under a progressive label to boot. The true story of an American arrested in Turkey for drug trafficking becomes a nightmare resolved with a sensationalism that is impactful yet worthy of a better cause, as is always the case in its director&#x27;s career&quot;.

Norman Stone described it as a &quot;brilliant, but quite misleading, film&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was made for $2.3 million and grossed over $35 million worldwide.

In 1978, the Turkish government unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the film from being screened in Israel.

==Awards and nominations==
==Soundtrack==
Released on 6 October 1978, by Casablanca Records, the soundtrack to &quot;Midnight Express&quot; was composed by Italian synth-pioneer Giorgio Moroder. The score won the Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1979.

==Legacy==

The quote &#x27;Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?&#x27;, in the American comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), is a reference to &quot;Midnight Express&quot;.

Susan&#x27;s prison visit was spoofed in the 1996 film &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;, where Jim Carrey opens his shirt, presses his naked breast against the glass, and cries, &#x27;Oh, Billy!&#x27;

An amateur interview with Billy Hayes appeared on YouTube, recorded during the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. He describes his experiences and expresses his disappointment with the film adaptation. In an article for the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, Hayes is reported as saying that the film &#x27;depicts all Turks as monsters&#x27;.

Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s work &quot;The Chase&quot; is often used as bumper music on the American late-night radio talk show radio program &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;.

In pro wrestling, several tag teams were called The Midnight Express. Original member Dennis Condrey said the name reflected how they dressed in black, drove black cars and partied past midnight. The most popular iteration, Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane, used the film&#x27;s theme, &quot;Chase&quot;, as their entrance music.

When he visited Turkey in 2004, screenwriter Oliver Stone - who won an Academy Award for writing the screenplay for &quot;Midnight Express&quot; - apologized for the portrayal of the Turkish people in the film. He &quot;eventually apologized for tampering with the truth&quot;.

&quot;Theme from Midnight Express&quot; is sampled on J Dilla&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of the Synths&quot;, which is prominently used on &quot;Gazzillion Ear&quot;, produced by J Dilla and performed by MF Doom, released in 2005 and 2009 respectively.

Hayes, Stone, and Alan Parker were invited to attend a special screening of &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, with prisoners in the garden of an L-type prison in Döşemealtı, Turkey, as part of the 47th Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival in October 2010.

Dialogue from &quot;Midnight Express&quot; was sampled in the song &quot;Sanctified&quot; on the original version of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, the debut album from Nine Inch Nails; the sample was removed from the 2010 remaster, for copyright reasons.

In 2016, Parker returned to Malta as a special guest during the second edition of the Valletta Film Festival to attend a screening of the film on 4 June at Fort St Elmo, where many of the prison scenes were filmed.

<text>An Unmarried Woman is a 1978 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Paul Mazursky and starring Jill Clayburgh, Alan Bates, Michael Murphy, and Cliff Gorman. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actress (Clayburgh).

==Plot==
Erica Benton works part-time at a SoHo art gallery and is in a seemingly happy marriage to Martin, a successful businessman. They live together with their teenage daughter Patti in an upscale apartment on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. Martin, however, has been having a year-long affair with a much younger woman named Marcia. When he confesses to Erica that he loves his mistress and wants to marry her, Erica is devastated, and Martin moves out.

With the help of Patti, her circle of close friends, and a therapist, Erica slowly comes to terms with the divorce and begins to get her life back on track. She reluctantly tries dating again, but after Martin&#x27;s betrayal and a disastrous blind date, she is even warier of ever finding a suitable man again. Her mistrust of men threatens her relationship with Patti, as she takes out her frustrations on Patti&#x27;s boyfriend, Phil. Out of desperation, Erica has sex with Charlie, an obnoxious, chauvinistic co-worker, but she does not find the experience fulfilling.

As she grows more accustomed to her new life, she meets Saul, an abstract painter, and begins a relationship with him. Both value their independence and so have a difficult time adjusting to domestic life. When Patti meets Saul, she is initially hostile, believing Erica is trying to bring him in to replace Martin, which Saul assures Patti is not his intention.

After a few tense meetings, Martin and Erica begin to act cordially towards each other, only for Martin to reveal that Marcia has left him and he wants Erica back. Erica rebuffs him.

Saul tries to convince Erica to come with him to his home in Vermont for the summer, where he spends five months every year with his children, but she declines, not wishing to leave her daughter and her life behind for so long. Outside Saul&#x27;s building, Erica helps him lower one of his paintings from his loft to the sidewalk. Shortly before driving away in his car, Saul reveals that the painting is a gift for Erica, leaving her to carry the giant canvas through the busy streets of Manhattan.

==Cast==
The abstract expressionist paintings in the film were created by artist Paul Jenkins, who taught Bates his painting technique for his acting role.

==Production==
Paul Mazursky began writing the script in 1976 after interviewing several different women about their thoughts on marriage and independence. He initially offered the role of Erica to Jane Fonda, who passed to star in &quot;Julia&quot;. Mazursky also considered Barbra Streisand for the lead but did not hear back from her agent. Finally, Jill Clayburgh was considered without an audition after Mazursky saw her in a New York play. At 32 years old, Clayburgh was thought to be too young to play a wife in a 16-year marriage with a teenage daughter, but Clayburgh returned to Mazursky&#x27;s office having styled herself in fashions indicative of an older woman and secured the part.

Principal photography began on April 5, 1977, in New York City, with the main locations being Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side and SoHo neighborhoods. Clayburgh worked the entire shoot without a day off; her character was written into every scene of a film that was on a tight budget.

Anthony Hopkins was offered the role of Saul but turned it down because the character does not show up until past the midway point of the script. British actor Alan Bates, whom Mazursky had always admired and who had never appeared in an American film, was given the part. Bates had some misgivings because he did not want to leave his dying father in England, but Mazursky assured him that he would be given seven days to be with his father in case of a tragic event. Bates conceded and his father died after he returned home.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Clayburgh is nothing less than extraordinary in what is the performance of the year to date. In her we see intelligence battling feelingreason backed against the wall by pushy needs.&quot;

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: 

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Jill Clayburgh is wondrous as a woman who loses her marriage – only to find herself – in this acutely observed and lived-in portrait of New York City life.&quot;

==Plot==

Ted Kramer, a workaholic advertising executive in New York City, has just landed an important account and job promotion. However, when he shares the news with Joanna, his wife of eight years, she shocks him by announcing she is leaving him. She walks out of the apartment without Billy, the couple&#x27;s seven-year-old son, because she feels she is unfit to be a mother. The next morning when Billy asks about his mother, Ted explains that she went away to be alone for a while.

Ted drops Billy at his elementary school by asking him what grade he attends and leaving him with a woman at the entrance, before rushing to work. At the ad agency, Ted confides about the situation to Jim O&#x27;Connor, his boss and friend. Jim is understanding, but hopes that Ted&#x27;s situation will not interfere with his new responsibility as the lead person on the Mid-Atlantic Airlines account.

Initially, Ted and Billy struggle to adapt to their new living situation as Billy misses his mother and Ted has to do the extra housework usually done by Joanna. Father and son gradually settle into a routine without Joanna, but Ted’s work suffers. Billy and Ted have a fight one evening in which Billy cries for his mother, but they later reconcile. When Billy worries his mother’s departure is his fault, Ted assures him that Joanna left because she was not happy in the marriage.

Meanwhile, Ted has become good friends with divorced neighbor Margaret Phelps, with whom Joanna was a confidante. One day, Billy has an accident when he falls off a jungle gym. Ted rushes him to the hospital, and asks the doctor to let him stay by his son&#x27;s side as he receives ten stitches.

After fifteen months, Ted receives a call from Joanna and meets her at a restaurant. Joanna reveals she is happier after working in California and seeing a therapist. When she states that she is now ready to raise her son and wants Billy to come live with her, Ted becomes furious and leaves. He consults with a divorce attorney John Shaunessy, who cautions that the court usually awards custody to the mother when the child is young.

At work, Jim notifies Ted the agency is letting him go because the Mid-Atlantic Airlines executives are displeased with his work. Knowing he has no chance at custody if he is unemployed, Ted doggedly tries to land a job within twenty-four hours, despite few ad firms hiring during the holiday season. He convinces two agency executives to consider his application immediately, and accepts a lower-salaried position for which he is overqualified.

The custody hearing begins. In court, Joanna asserts that Ted never abused her or was unfaithful, but she lost her self-esteem as a stay-at-home mother. She insists she has since &quot;become a whole person again&quot; and believes her son needs her more than his father. Ted states he has proven that he can parent as well as Joanna, and insists that taking Billy away from him could cause &quot;irreparable&quot; harm.

The legal battle becomes contentious when the attorneys resort to brutal character assassinations. Shaunessy brings Joanna to tears by forcing her to admit that she was part of the marriage&#x27;s failure. Ted also admits he made mistakes as a father and husband. However, his job loss and Billy&#x27;s accident are used to discredit him. Ted expresses resentment at Joanna for her attorney&#x27;s aggressive tactics. Margaret testifies on behalf of Ted and implores Joanna to recognize that he has become a great father.

Later, Ted learns Joanna was awarded custody. He decides not to appeal in order to spare Billy the burden of testifying in court. Billy becomes upset as Ted explains that they will still see each other, even though Billy will be living with his mother. On the morning Joanna is scheduled to pick up Billy, she rings the apartment building&#x27;s intercom and asks to see Ted in the lobby alone. She tearfully reveals that she is relinquishing custody after realizing that she does not want to take Billy away from his home. Ted reassures her as she takes the elevator up to inform her son.

== Cast ==
==Production==
Producer Stanley R. Jaffe and writer and director Robert Benton read Avery Corman&#x27;s source novel, and were so moved by the story that they bought the rights to make it into a film. Dustin Hoffman was the only actor they envisioned in the lead role of Ted Kramer.

Hoffman, going through a divorce at the time, initially turned down the role. He has since stated that, at that time, he had wanted to quit film acting and return to the stage, due to his depression and distaste for Hollywood. While Jaffe and Benton were courting Hoffman, James Caan was offered the role, but turned it down, as he was concerned the film would be a flop. Al Pacino was offered the role, but felt it was not for him. Jon Voight also turned down the role. Hoffman met with Jaffe and Benton at a London hotel during the making of &quot;Agatha&quot; (1979), and was convinced to accept the role. Hoffman has credited Benton and this film for rejuvenating his love of film acting, and inspiring the emotional level of many scenes. Hoffman was reminded of his love for children and &quot;got closer being a father by playing a father&quot;.

Benton and Jaffe selected Justin Henry to play Billy. Hoffman worked extensively with Henry, then 7 years old, in each scene to put him at ease. Benton encouraged Henry to improvise to make his performance more natural. The ice cream scene in which Billy defies Ted by skipping dinner and eating ice cream was all improvised by Hoffman and Henry. Hoffman contributed many personal moments and dialogue; Benton offered shared screenplay credit but Hoffman declined.

Kate Jackson was offered the role of Joanna Kramer, but had to turn it down, as producer Aaron Spelling was unable to rearrange the shooting schedule of the TV series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, in which Jackson was starring. The part was offered to Faye Dunaway, Jane Fonda and Ali MacGraw before Meryl Streep was cast.

Streep was initially cast as Phyllis (the role eventually taken by JoBeth Williams), but she was able to force her way into auditioning for Joanna in front of Hoffman, Benton and Jaffe. She found the character in the novel and script unsympathetic (&quot;an ogre, a princess, an ass&quot;, as she called her), and approached Joanna from a more sympathetic point of view. Hoffman believed the death of Streep&#x27;s fiancé, John Cazale, only months earlier, gave her an emotional edge and &quot;still-fresh pain&quot; to draw on for the performance. Streep was contracted to work only 12 days on the film.

Gail Strickland was first cast as Ted&#x27;s neighbor Margaret, but departed after a week of filming (due to &quot;artistic differences&quot;, according to Columbia Pictures), and was replaced by Jane Alexander. Michael Schulman claims Strickland was so rattled by the intensity of filming with Hoffman that she developed a stammer, making her lines difficult to follow. Strickland disputes this account, saying she couldn&#x27;t quickly memorize improvised lines Hoffman gave her, which agitated him, and she was fired two days later.

Cinematographer Néstor Almendros, a collaborator on numerous François Truffaut films, had been hired with the expectation that Truffaut would direct. Truffaut turned it down, as he was busy with his own projects, and suggested screenwriter Robert Benton direct the film.

JoBeth Williams worried about disrobing in the scene with a young Justin Henry. &quot;I was afraid my nudity would traumatize the little boy,&quot; she said, but was relieved that he seemed unbothered.

==Controversy==
Hoffman has been widely reported to have harassed Streep during the making of the film, and the two had a contentious working relationship. In a 1979 &quot;Time&quot; magazine interview, Streep claimed that Hoffman groped her breast on their first meeting, although a representative for Streep said the article was not &quot;an accurate rendering of that meeting&quot;. When Streep advocated portraying Joanna as more sympathetic and vulnerable than she was written, she received pushback from Hoffman. Such was his commitment to method acting, he would hurl insults and obscenities at Streep, taunt her with the name of her recently deceased fiancé, John Cazale, claiming it was designed to draw a better performance from her. He famously shattered a wine glass against the wall without telling her (although he did inform the cameraman beforehand), sending glass shards into her hair. Her response was, &quot;Next time you do that, I&#x27;d appreciate you letting me know.&quot; In 2018, Streep claimed that Hoffman slapped her hard without warning while filming a scene. &quot;This was my first film, and it was my first take in my first film, and he just slapped me. And you see it in the film. It was overstepping.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with high praise for its direction, story, screenplay and performances of the cast, with major praise directed towards Hoffman and Streep&#x27;s performances.

 It has a score of 77 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on nine reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars, giving praise to Benton&#x27;s screenplay. &quot;His characters aren&#x27;t just talking to each other, they&#x27;re revealing things about themselves and can sometimes be seen in the act of learning about their own motives. That&#x27;s what makes &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; such a touching film: We get the feeling at times that personalities are changing and decisions are being made even as we watch them.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;fine, witty, moving, most intelligent adaptation of Avery Corman&#x27;s best-selling novel&quot;, with Streep giving &quot;one of the major performances of the year&quot;, and Hoffman &quot;splendid in one of the two or three best roles of his career.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, and wrote, &quot;&quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; never loses its low-key, realistic touch. You will sit at the end of the film wondering why we don&#x27;t see more pictures like this. After all, its story is not all that unusual.&quot; He thought that Hoffman gave &quot;one of his most memorable performances&quot;, and &quot;should win the Academy Award next April&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Stories on screen about men leaving women, and women leaving men have been abundant as of late, but hardly any has grappled with the issue in such a forthright and honest fashion as &quot;Kramer&quot; ... While a nasty court battle ensues, the human focus is never abandoned, and it&#x27;s to the credit of not only Benton and Jaffe, but especially Hoffman and Streep, that both leading characters emerge as credible and sympathetic.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared it &quot;as nearly perfect a film as can be&quot;, and &quot;a motion picture with an emotional wallop second to none this year.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a triumph of partisan pathos, a celebration of father-son bonding that astutely succeeds where tearjerkers like &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979) so mawkishly failed&quot;.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;All the people go through expected difficulties the way that runners take the hurdles in a track event: no surprise in it, it&#x27;s just a question of how they do it. But the actors make it more.&quot;

Shortly after the film&#x27;s release, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine published separate articles in which members of the bar and bench criticized the court battle scenes as &quot;legally out of date&quot;. According to the legal experts interviewed for the articles, a modern judge would have made use of psychological reports, and also would have considered the wishes of the child. Another criticism was that the option of joint custody was never explored.

In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

===Box office===
&quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; grossed $5,559,722 in its opening week from 534 theaters. It went on to gross $106.3 million in the United States and Canada. In its first 13 weeks overseas, it grossed more than $67 million. It went on to become Columbia&#x27;s highest-grossing film overseas, with theatrical rentals of $57 million, until surpassed in 1990 by &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; (released by Columbia TriStar internationally).

==Cultural impact==
&quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; reflected a cultural shift that occurred during the 1970s, when ideas about motherhood and fatherhood were changing. The film was widely praised for the way in which it gave equal weight and importance to both Joanna and Ted&#x27;s points of view.

The film made use of the first movement of Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s Mandolin Concerto in C Major, making the piece more familiar among classical music listeners.

&quot;Mon fils, ma bataille&quot;, the song about a painful divorce and a father&#x27;s struggle to keep custody of his child, was inspired by Daniel Balavoine&#x27;s parents&#x27; divorce, his guitarist Colin Swinburne&#x27;s divorce, and by the film &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;.

==Adaptation==
In 1990, the film was remade in Turkish as &quot;Oğulcan&quot;, directed and acted by Cüneyt Arkın, in Hindi as &quot;Akele Hum Akele Tum&quot; in 1995, starring Aamir Khan and Manisha Koirala, and in Urdu as &quot;Zindagi Kitni Haseen Hay&quot; in 2016, starring Sajal Ali and Feroze Khan.

<text>Breaking Away is a 1979 American coming of age comedy-drama film produced and directed by Peter Yates and written by Steve Tesich. It follows a group of four male teenagers in Bloomington, Indiana, who have recently graduated from high school. The film stars Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern (in his film debut), Jackie Earle Haley, Barbara Barrie, Paul Dooley, and Robyn Douglass.

&quot;Breaking Away&quot; won the 1979 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Tesich, and received nominations in four other categories, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress (Barbara Barrie). It also won the 1979 Golden Globe Award for Best Film (Comedy or Musical) and received nominations in three other Golden Globe categories. The film was ranked eighth on the List of America&#x27;s 100 Most Inspiring Movies compiled by the American Film Institute (AFI) in 2006. In June 2008, the AFI also announced its 10 Top 10—the best ten films in ten classic American film genres—after it polled over 1,500 people from the creative community. In that poll &quot;Breaking Away&quot; ranked as the eighth best film in the sports genre.

As the film&#x27;s young lead, Christopher won the 1979 BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer and the 1979 Young Artist Award for Best Juvenile Actor, as well as getting a Golden Globe nomination as New Star of the Year.
==Plot==
Dave, Mike, Cyril, and Moocher are working-class friends living in the university town of Bloomington, Indiana. Now turning 19, they all graduated from high school the year before, are not sure what to do with their lives, and consider attending university unrealistic. They spend much of their time together swimming in an abandoned water-filled limestone quarry. They sometimes clash with the more affluent Indiana University students in their hometown, who refer to them disparagingly as &quot;cutters,&quot; referring to the locals&#x27; common work in the limestone industry. (The term was invented for the film because the real-world pejorative &quot;stonies&quot; was deemed unusable for its perceived link to marijuana.)

Dave is obsessed with competitive bicycle racing, Italian racers in particular, because he recently won a Masi bicycle. His down-to-earth father, Ray, a former stonecutter who now operates (sometimes unethically) his own used car business, is puzzled and exasperated by his son&#x27;s love of Italian music and culture, which Dave associates with cycling. However, his mother, Evelyn, is more understanding and prepares Italian dishes for the family, to Ray&#x27;s annoyance.

Dave develops a crush on a university student named Katherine and masquerades as an Italian exchange student to romance her. One evening, he serenades &quot;Caterina&quot; outside her sorority house by singing Friedrich von Flotow&#x27;s aria &quot;M Apparì Tutt&#x27; Amor&quot;, with Cyril providing guitar accompaniment. Her boyfriend, Rod, and his fraternity brothers beat Cyril up because they mistake him for the suitor. Cyril wants no trouble, but Mike, a former high school football quarterback, insists on tracking down Rod and starting a brawl. The university president (played by real-life President Dr. John W. Ryan) reprimands the students for their arrogance toward the &quot;cutters&quot; and, over the students&#x27; objections, invites the town to field a team for the annual Indiana University Little 500 race.

When an Italian cycling team comes to town for an exhibition race, Dave is thrilled to compete with them. However, the Italians are annoyed by his challenge to their preordained victory and force him to crash, which disillusions him. He subsequently confesses his deception to Katherine, who is heartbroken.

Dave&#x27;s friends persuade him to join them in racing the Little 500. Ray privately tells his son how, when he was a young stonecutter, he was proud to help provide the material to construct the university though he never felt welcome on campus. Later, Dave runs into Katherine, who is leaving for a job in Chicago. They patch things up.

Dave, the only skilled cyclist among his friends, rides most of the Little 500 without a break unlike the other teams, which switch riders periodically. Nonetheless, he gains a small lead, but is injured in a crash and comes in for a change. Mike, Cyril, and Moocher take turns to the best of their ability, but the team falls behind. Finally, Dave has them tape his feet to the pedals, which commits him to finish the race himself, and makes up lost ground. On the last lap, he overtakes Rod (who is riding for the favored fraternity team) and wins.

Ray is proud of his son and takes to riding a bicycle himself for his health. Dave later enrolls at the university, where he meets a pretty French student. Soon, he is extolling to her the virtues of the Tour de France and of French cyclists.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Inspiration===
The bicycling team is based on the 1962 Phi Kappa Psi Little 500 champions, which featured legendary rider and Italian enthusiast Dave Blase, who provided screenwriter and fellow Phi Kappa Psi team member Steve Tesich the inspiration for the main character in the movie. Blase, together with team manager Bob Stohler, provided the name of this character: Dave Stohler. In the 1962 race, Blase rode 139 out of 200 laps and crossed the finish line as the victor, much like the main character in the film. Blase appears in the movie as the race announcer.

The working title of the movie script was &quot;Bambino&quot;, written in 1978, which originally had Dave&#x27;s family name as &quot;Blase,&quot; which was later changed to &quot;Stohler&quot; for the film.

===Filming===
Location filming in and around Bloomington took place during the summer of 1978. 

The abandoned limestone quarry in which Dave and his friends swam, called Rooftop Quarry by locals, is at the end of East Empire Mill Road, off the old State Road 37, in Perry Township, south of Bloomington.

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews upon its release. Roger Ebert called it &quot;a wonderfully sunny, funny, goofy, intelligent movie that makes you feel about as good as any movie in a long time. It is, in fact, a treasure... Movies like this are hardly ever made at all; when they&#x27;re made this well, they&#x27;re precious cinematic miracles.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Janet Maslin wrote that, even though &quot;the cast is unknown, the director has a spotty history, and the basic premise falls into this year&#x27;s most hackneyed category ... the finished product is wonderful. Here is a movie so fresh and funny it didn&#x27;t even need a big budget or a pedigree.&quot; A &quot;Variety&quot; magazine review concluded that &quot;though its plot wins no points for originality, &quot;Breaking Away&quot; is a thoroughly delightful light comedy, lifted by fine performances from Dennis Christopher and Paul Dooley.&quot; Critic Dave Kehr, however, gave a later, somewhat dissenting opinion: &quot;Released at a time when any small-scale film earned critical favor simply by virtue of its unpretentiousness, Breaking Away probably looked better in context than it does now.&quot; However, he conceded that &quot;Peter Yates lends the film a fine, unexpected limpidity, and the principals are mostly excellent.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 42 reviews, with a rating average of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;At once a touching, funny coming-of-age story and a compelling sports film, &quot;Breaking Away&quot; is a delightful treat.&quot; On Metacritic—which assigns a weighted mean score—the film has a score of 91 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The film grossed approximately $20 million in North America.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

NBC paid $5 million to screen the film on television on May 5, 1980, bypassing HBO and significantly shortening the normal window between theatrical release and screening on broadcast television, which was generally three years at the time.

==Accolades==


==Legacy==
A short-lived television series based on the film, also titled &quot;Breaking Away&quot;, aired in 1980–1981 and starred Shaun Cassidy. Barrie, Haley and Ashton reprised their roles in the prequel series.

The film inspired the song &quot;One for the Cutters&quot; by The Hold Steady, which appeared on their 2008 album &quot;Stay Positive&quot;.

The 1992 Bollywood film &quot;Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar&quot;, starring Aamir Khan, has certain similarities to &quot;Breaking Away&quot;. However, the director, Mansoor Khan, stated that he became aware of &quot;Breaking Away&quot; only after the likeness had been brought to his attention. Both films have several thematic similarities, including friendship, class barriers, bicycle racing, and parental relationship, but they are distinctly different films, with different narratives, characters, motivations, treatment, and racing rules.

<doc id="103030" wikidata="Q8735" url="?curid=103030" title="Medes">
<text>The Medes were an ancient Iranian people who spoke the Median language and who inhabited an area known as Media between western and northern Iran. Around the 11th century BC, they occupied the mountainous region of northwestern Iran and the northeastern and eastern region of Mesopotamia in the vicinity of Ecbatana (present-day Hamadan). Their consolidation in Iran is believed to have occurred during the 8th century BC. In the 7th century BC, all of western Iran and some other territories were under Median rule, but their precise geographic extent remains unknown.

Although widely recognized as playing an important role in the history of the ancient Near East, the Medes left no written records to reconstruct their history. Knowledge of the Medes comes only from foreign sources such as the Assyrians, Babylonians, Armenians and Greeks, as well as a few Iranian archaeological sites, which are believed to have been occupied by Medes. The accounts related to the Medes reported by Herodotus convey the image of a powerful people, who would have formed an empire at the beginning of the 7th century BC that lasted until the 550s BC, played a pivotal role in the fall of the Assyrian Empire, and competed with the powerful kingdoms of Lydia and Babylonia. However, a recent reassessment of contemporary sources from the Median period has altered scholars&#x27; perceptions of the Median state. The state remains difficult to perceive in the documentation, which leaves many doubts about its extent; some specialists have even suggested that there never was a powerful Median kingdom. In any case, it appears that after the fall of the last Median king against the Persian king Cyrus the Great, Media became an important province and was prized by the empires which successively dominated it (Achaemenids, Seleucids, Parthians and Sasanids).

== Etymology ==
The original source for their name and homeland is a directly transmitted Old Iranian geographical name which is attested as the Old Persian &quot;Māda-&quot; (). The meaning of this word is not precisely known. However, the linguist W. Skalmowski proposes a relation with the proto-Indo European word &quot;med(h)-&quot;, meaning &quot;central, suited in the middle&quot;, by referring to the Old Indic &quot;madhya-&quot; and Old Iranian &quot;maidiia-&quot; which both carry the same meaning. The Latin &quot;medium&quot;, Greek &quot;méso&quot;, Armenian &quot;mej&quot;, and English &quot;mid&quot; are similarly derived from it.

Greek scholars during antiquity would base ethnological conclusions on Greek legends and the similarity of names. According to the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus (440 BC):
== Archaeology ==

The discoveries of Median sites in Iran happened only after the 1960s. Prior to the 1960s, the search for Median archeological sources has mostly focused in an area known as the &quot;Median triangle&quot;, defined roughly as the region bounded by Hamadan and Malayer (in Hamadan province) and Kangavar (in Kermanshah province). Three major sites from central western Iran in the Iron Age III period (i.e. 850–500 BC) are:
* Tepe Nush-i Jan (a primarily religious site of Median period),
:The site is located 14 km west of Malāyer in Hamadan province. The excavations started in 1967 with David Stronach as the director. The remains of four main buildings in the site are &quot;the central temple, the western temple, the fort, and the columned hall&quot; which according to Stronach were likely to have been built in the order named and predate the latter occupation of the first half of the 6th century BC. According to Stronach, the central temple, with its stark design, &quot;provides a notable, if mute, expression of religious belief and practice&quot;. A number of ceramics from the Median levels at Tepe Nush-i Jan have been found which are associated with a period (the second half of the 7th century BC) of power consolidation in the Hamadān areas. These findings show four different wares known as &quot;common ware&quot; (buff, cream, or light red in colour and with gold or silver mica temper) including jars in various size the largest of which is a form of ribbed pithoi. Smaller and more elaborate vessels were in &quot;grey ware&quot;, (these display smoothed and burnished surface). The &quot;cooking ware&quot; and &quot;crumbly ware&quot; are also recognized each in single handmade products.
* Godin Tepe (Godin Tepe&#x27;s Level II: a fortified palace of a Median king or tribal chief),
:The site is located 13 km east of Kangāvar city on the left bank of the river Gamas Āb&quot;. The excavations, started in 1965, were led by T. C. Young, Jr. According to David Stronach, the evidence shows an important Bronze Age construction that was reoccupied sometime before the beginning of the Iron III period. The excavations of Young indicate the remains of part of a single residence of a local ruler which later became quite substantial. This is similar to those mentioned often in Assyrian sources.
* Babajan (probably the seat of a lesser tribal ruler of Media).
:The site is located in northeastern Lorestan with a distance of roughly 10 km from Nūrābād in Lorestan province. The excavations were conducted by C. Goff in 1966–69. The second level of this site probably dates to the 7th century BC.
These sources have both similarities (in cultural characteristics) and differences (due to functional differences and diversity among the Median tribes). The architecture of these archaeological findings, which can probably be dated to the Median period, show a link between the tradition of columned audience halls often seen in the Achaemenid Empire (for example in Persepolis) and Safavid Iran (for example in Chehel Sotoun from the 17th century AD) and what is seen in Median architecture.

The materials found at Tepe Nush-i Jan, Godin Tepe, and other sites located in Media, together with the Assyrian reliefs show the existence of urban settlements in Media in the first half of the 1st millennium BC which functioned as centres for the production of handicrafts and also of an agricultural and cattle-breeding economy of a secondary type. For other historical documentation, the archaeological evidence, though rare, together with Assyrian cuneiform records makes it possible, regardless of Herodotus&#x27; accounts, to establish some of the early history of the Medians.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
At the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Iranian tribes emerged in the region of northwest Iran. These tribes expanded their control over larger areas. Iranian tribes were present in western and northwestern Iran from at least the 12th or 11th centuries BC. But the significance of Iranian elements in these regions were established from the beginning of the second half of the 8th century BC. By this time the Iranian tribes were the majority in what later become the territory of the Median Kingdom and also the west of Media proper. A study of textual sources from the region shows that in the Neo-Assyrian period, the regions of Media, and further to the west and the northwest, had a population with Iranian speaking people as the majority.

In western and northwestern Iran and in areas further west prior to Median rule, there is evidence of the earlier political activity of the powerful societies of Elam, Mannaea, Assyria and Urartu. There are various and updated opinions on the positions and activities of Iranian tribes in these societies prior to the &quot;major Iranian state formations&quot; in the late 7th century BC. One opinion (of Herzfeld, &quot;et al.&quot;) is that the ruling class were &quot;Iranian migrants&quot; but the society was &quot;autonomous&quot; while another opinion (of Grantovsky, &quot;et al.&quot;) holds that both the ruling class and basic elements of the population were Iranian.

The Medes first appear on the historical scene in the 9th century BCE, when they are mentioned in contemporary Assyrian texts. By this time, it is highly likely that Indo-Iranian-speaking peoples had already settled in Western Iran at least some 500 years — if not 1,000 years — prior to this period. Most scholars believe that the arrival of Indo-Iranian speaking populations into Western Iran was not the result of one mass migration, but instead small groups of nomadic pastoralists gradually infiltrated the region from the northeast over a long period of time, perhaps dating back to the early 2nd millennium BCE. These pastoralist groups gave rise to diverse cultural and linguistic groups, with one such group eventually coalescing into the people referred to by the Assyrians as the Medes. From the 9th century BCE onwards the Medes were well established in Western Iran and frequently clashed with the Assyrians, their powerful neighbors to the west.

=== Assyrian intervention in Median territories ===
The Zagros Mountains and the Iranian Plateau were politically fragmented in the extreme. The Assyrian sources of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE tell of a bewildering number of kings and chieftains who ruled areas of different sizes, most of which seem to have been very small. In referring to the Median rulers, the Assyrian texts use the title &quot;bēl āli&quot; (meaning &quot;city lord&quot;), a term for petty rulers who were not important enough to be called kings. Since there&#x27;s no very large settlements in Median territory, &quot;bēl āli&quot; is sometimes translated as &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;chieftain&quot;. From the Assyrian perspective, the Medes were a strange people living beyond the eastern fringes of the civilized world. Shalmaneser III (858-824 BC) was the first Assyrian king who made serious efforts to extend the power of his kingdom beyond the reaches of northern Mesopotamia, and he was the first Assyrian king to reach the Iranian Plateau. Although his army operated near Median territories in 843, 827, and 826 BCE, the Medes are not mentioned in the reports on these campaigns. Only once, in 834, did Shalmaneser sally forth from Parsua in order to attack four settlements in the regions of &quot;Messi, Amadaya, Araziaš and Harhar.&quot; Among these, Amadaya can be identified as Media. Shalmaneser&#x27;s attack was, however, a mere side show without any consequences since Media was not the focus of Shalmaneser&#x27;s attention.

The Assyrian interest in the Iranian highlands probably stemmed from their need for horses to supply the chariots and cavalry of their armed forces. For most of the 9th century BCE, the Assyrians found what they needed in the Zagros Mountains, in areas closer to the Assyrian heartland and more accessible. However, the situation changed when the kingdom of Urartu expanded into the areas south of Lake Urmia, thus cutting off Assyria&#x27;s most convenient connection with central Iran. This prompted Assyria to seek new and more reliable access routes connecting Assyria with horse-breeding areas far from Urartian interference. This attracted Assyria&#x27;s attention to the Medes, renowned for their wealth of horses. In a campaign in 819 or 818 BCE, Shamshi-Adad V (823-811 BCE) led Assyrian forces deep into western Iran. Advancing through Mesa, Gizilbunda, Mataya (Media), and Araziaš, he followed the path previously taken by Shalmaneser III in 834 BCE. During this expedition, Assyrian forces encountered and fought a ruler named Hanaşiruka in Media. According to Shamshi-Adad&#x27;s inscriptions, they purportedly killed 2,300 of Hanaşiruka&#x27;s warriors and 140 cavalrymen, and Hanaşiruka&#x27;s royal city of Sagbita was destroyed, along with 1,200 other settlements. However, considering later campaigns in the region, these figures seem exaggerated. Hanaşiruka fared better than his neighboring rulers, the king of Gizilbunda and the ruler of Araziaš. Hanaşiruka not only survived the assault but also did not submit to the Assyrian king and apparently had no booty taken from his land. While only a fraction of the Median territories was affected by Shamshi-Adad&#x27;s incursion, this marked the first of a series of Assyrian attempts to exert its power over the horse breeders of western Iran. Between 810 and 766 BCE, at least seven and possibly as many as nine Assyrian campaigns were directed against Media, climaxing in the years 793-787 BCE when Nergal-ila&#x27;i, the commander-in-chief of Adad-nirari III (810-783 BCE), led no fewer than five expeditions east-ward.

The earliest Assyrian incursions into the Zagros region seem to have focused mainly on plunder. It is only under the king Tiglath-Pileser III (744-727 BCE) and his successors that the Assyrians attempted to take direct control of Median territory by founding new Assyrian provinces in the western Zagros. They also converted some Median towns to Assyrian centers, renaming them with the prefix &quot;kār&quot;, which meant &quot;harbor&quot; or &quot;trading station&quot;. Their new names highlight their central role in commerce. In the course of his campaigns, Tiglath-Pileser III established two new provinces, expanding the permanent Assyrian presence much further onto the Iranian Plateau. East of the existing Assyrian province of Zamua (established no later than 843 BCE), Tiglath-Pileser founded the province of Parsua. Additionally, the province of Namri, likely established in the 790s BCE, now shared a border with the newly created province of Bit-Hamban. The Assyrian overland route connecting the Median territories with the Mesopotamian lowlands now reached as far as the strategically significant city of Harhar on the Iranian Plateau. In 738 BCE, Tiglath-Pileser sent an army detachment against &quot;the mighty Medes in the east&quot;, likely in the region beyond Mount Alvand. The operation was successful, with the Assyrians capturing the settlement of Mulugani and capturing &quot;5,000 horses, people, oxen, sheep and goats.&quot;

Sargon II (721-705 BCE) resumed efforts to strengthen the Assyrian Empire&#x27;s grip on western Iran even further. This renewed advance was a highly concentrated affair, accomplished in just four years from 716 to 713 BCE, during which time the Median lands were invaded no fewer than three times. Most chiefs who paid tribute in 714 BCE, did not do so again in 713 BCE, which shows that even when the Assyrian Empire&#x27;s involvement with the Median territories was at its absolute peak, only a small fraction of the Median chiefs in power established a lasting relationship with the Assyrian conqueror. The majority anticipated that Assyrian forces would eventually withdraw, as they had done in the past. However, the establishment of fortresses in Harhar and Kišesim in 716 BCE marked a turning point. From then on, the Assyrians maintained a permanent presence in western Iran.

However, the effectiveness of Assyrian rule was still limited and remained weak, especially in areas east of the Zagros mountain range. Since direct control over the Medes was challenging to keep, deals were made with those local rulers. In exchange for recognizing the Assyrian king&#x27;s authority, providing a fixed quantity of horses as tribute, and fulfilling other obligations, cooperative chiefs received the protection of the Assyrian Empire and retained the freedom to govern their subjects as they deemed fit. This compromise usually suited both sides well. Sargon II undertook another expedition to Media in 708 BCE but was unable to achieve his goal of conquering all Median lands or establishing stable control over them. Subsequently, the tribes on the Iranian plateau opposing Assyrian dominance consolidated their efforts against it. By the end of the 8th century BCE, the first major unions and states based on tribal confederations began to emerge in the western Iranian territory, led by local chiefs. While during Sargon II&#x27;s reign, the Medes seemed contained through diplomacy and the strategic backing of competing factions, by the time of his grandson Esarhaddon (680-669 BCE), the Assyrians appeared to have lost ground in Media. Records from this period indicate unrest in the Median provinces. In inquiries directed to the god Shamash, the king seeks guidance on the power of the Medes and their allies, the Cimmerians and Manneans. Notably, the &quot;bēl-āli&quot; of Karkaššî, Kashtariti, becomes the focus of the king&#x27;s concern. Even the once routine collection of horse tribute from the Medes now encounters unexpected difficulties.

The &quot;adê&quot; tablets record the oaths made by eight Zagros-dwelling &quot;bēl-ālāni&quot; who swore loyalty to Esarhaddon and his crown prince Ashurbanipal (668-631 BCE). The interpretation of these oaths has been a subject of debate, ranging from vassal treaties to the swearing in of a corps of Median bodyguards to the crown prince. The discovery of a very similar tablet from the Syrian site of Tell Tayinat points to an empire-wide attempt at making all allies swear allegiance to the crown-prince before Esarhaddon&#x27;s death. Six years prior one of these &quot;bēl-ālāni&quot;, Ramataya of Urakazabarna, had visited the Assyrian court. He brought tribute in the form of horses and lapis lazuli, seeking Esarhaddon&#x27;s assistance against rival &quot;bēl-ālāni&quot;. However, it appears that the oaths and alliances eventually fell apart, leading to the tablets that documented them being taken from the temple storage room and crushed. While, by the mid-seventh century, the Median &quot;bēl-ālāni&quot; seemed poised to form alliances that could have united against the Assyrians, there is no indication that the fundamental political structure of the Medes as independent &quot;bēl-ālāni&quot; was undergoing significant changes as Herodotus&#x27;s story of Deioces&#x27;s rise would suggest. The last mention of Median &quot;bēl-ālāni&quot; comes from an inscription of Ashurbanipal that recounts a campaign of 656 BCE, in which three Median &quot;bēl-ālāni&quot; rebelled and were captured and brought back to Nineveh. As it became conceivable for a united Media to defeat Assyria and assume her mantle of power in the region, the impetus to unite may have been stronger than the competitive forces dividing the &quot;bēl-ālāni&quot;.

After 670 BCE, susceptible to Scythian and Cimmerian raids and facing the decline of trade along the Great Khorasan Road, many Median chiefdoms probably collapsed leaving fewer chiefs to compete for power. The states of non-Iranian peoples like the Manneans, Elippians, and Kassites probably collapsed as well, which allowed Median groups to take over their territory. With fewer chiefs remaining, one of them might have risen to the position of paramount chief, subjugating his former equals. Cyaxares probably rose to prominence in this context. He may indeed have fought the Scythians, as Herodotus claims, which may have earned him his reputation as a great warrior. Through his victories, Cyaxares gained more and more influence, eventually uniting the Medes and other peoples under his leadership.

=== Rise and fall ===

From the 10th to the late 7th centuries BCE, the western parts of Media fell under the domination of the vast Neo-Assyrian Empire, which stretched from Cyprus in the west, to parts of western Iran in the east, and Egypt and the north of the Arabian Peninsula. During the reign of Sinsharishkun (622–612 BCE), the Assyrian empire, which had been in a state of constant civil war since 626 BCE, began to unravel. Subject peoples, such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, Scythians, Cimmerians, and Arameans quietly ceased to pay tribute to Assyria.

Assyrian dominance over the Medes came to an end during the reign of Median king Cyaxares, who, in alliance with the Babylonian king Nabopolassar, attacked and destroyed the strife-riven Neo-Assyrian Empire between 616 and 609 BCE. After the fall of Assyria, a unified Median state became one of the four major powers of the ancient Near East together with Babylonia, Lydia, and Egypt. The Medes were subsequently able to expand beyond their original homeland and had eventually a territory stretching roughly from northeastern Iran to the Kızılırmak River in Anatolia.

Cyaxares was succeeded by his son Astyages. In 553 BCE, Cyrus the Great, the King of Persia, a Median vassal, revolted against the Median king. In 550 BCE, Cyrus finally won a decisive victory resulting in Astyages&#x27; capture by his own dissatisfied nobles, who promptly turned him over to the triumphant Cyrus.

==== Median dynasty ====
In Herodotus (I, 95–130), Deioces is introduced as the founder of a centralized Median state. He had been known to the Median people as &quot;a just and incorruptible man&quot; and when asked by the Median people to solve their possible disputes he agreed and put forward the condition that they make him &quot;king&quot; and build a great city at Ecbatana as the capital of the Median state. Judging from the contemporary sources of the region, and disregarding the account of Herodotus, puts the formation of a unified Median state during the reign of Cyaxares or later.

The list of Median rulers and their period of reign is compiled according to two sources. Firstly, Herodotus who calls them &quot;kings&quot; and associates them with the same family. Secondly, the Babylonian Chronicles which in &quot;Gadd&#x27;s Chronicle on the Fall of Nineveh&quot; gives its own list. A combined list stretching over 150 years is thus:

* Deioces (700s–675 BC)
* Phraortes (675–653 BC)
* Scythian rule (652–624 BC)
* Cyaxares (624–585 BC)
* Astyages (585–550 BC)

However, not all of these dates and personalities given by Herodotus match the other near eastern sources.

=== Later history ===

After Cyrus&#x27;s victory against Astyages, the Medes were subjected to their close kin, the Persians. In the new empire they retained a prominent position; in honour and war, they stood next to the Persians; their court ceremony was adopted by the new sovereigns, who in the summer months resided in Ecbatana; and many noble Medes were employed as officials, satraps and generals.

In later periods, Medes and especially Mede soldiers are identified and portrayed prominently in ancient archaeological sites such as Persepolis, where they are shown to have a major role and presence in the military of the Achaemenid Empire.

== Culture and society ==
=== Society ===

The almost complete lack of written material makes it difficult to know how the Medes conceived their society. According to Herodotus, Persian society during the reign of Cyrus the Great was composed of &#x27;numerous tribes&#x27; (&quot;génea&quot;), and each tribe was divided into &#x27;clans&#x27; (&quot;phrātría&quot;). This general outline by the Greek historian reflects the concept that the social groups individuals belonged to were family, clan, tribe, and country. Although clan affiliations or tribal connections of significant individuals are rarely mentioned in Achaemenid period texts, the Persians still identified themselves through their relationships with family (paternal name), clan, and tribe. It is quite likely that the Medes did the same, as, according to Herodotus, their nation was also composed of tribes (&quot;génēa&quot;).

Assyrian inscriptions use the unusual term &quot;bēl-āli&quot; for the Median leaders, a term that is occasionally applied also to other rulers of polities in the Zagros mountains, but otherwise unknown in the Assyrian records. Literally translated the term means &quot;head of a city&quot; but it has been variously translated as &quot;chieftain&quot;, &quot;city leader&quot;, or &quot;city lord&quot;. The term as used by the Assyrians is probably also a reflection of their own interpretation of a power structure that was unfamiliar to them and could only be rendered in terms that the Assyrians themselves understood. It is clear from Assyrian sources that the position of &quot;bēl-āli&quot; could be hereditary. The Assyrian sources do not provide any information about the organizational structure above the level of chieftains, and the inner structure of these Median chiefdoms remain largely unknown. According to Herodotus, the Medes were divided into six tribes: Busai, Paretakenians, Struchates, Arizantians, Budians, and Magians. The name of these tribes appear to be completely unknown to the Assyrians despite centuries of direct contact with various Median groups. Only the name of Herodotus&#x27;s Paretakenians sounds similar to the lands of Partakka and Partukka, whose chieftains sought help from the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (680-669 BC). If any tribal structures existed from the 9th to the 7th century BC, their political significance was likely minimal. Contrary to expectations, the Medes&#x27; internal rivalries did not result in the concentration of land, wealth, and power in the hands of a steadily decreasing number of chieftains over time, the opposite occurred. In 819 BC, a small number of Median chiefs fielded considerably stronger forces against Assyria than their more numerous descendants did in the later half of the 8th century BC, when they were attacked by Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II. This suggests that sons of chieftains had equal inheritance rights, leading to the division of their father&#x27;s lands, increasing the number of chiefdoms, and accelerating Media&#x27;s political fragmentation. Sargon II&#x27;s inscriptions alone identify at least 55 Median chiefdoms, and considering that there were likely additional less important chiefdoms not mentioned in Assyrian records, the total number could have been close to a hundred or even more.

Presumably the tribal union of the Medes was not merely nominal. It is to this union that the Medes must have owed at times the possibility of collective action with a choice of capable leaders. But such unity could manifest itself only occasionally. In the majority of the cases the Medes, in spite of their strength, were divided. The six Median tribes resided in Media proper, the triangular area between Rhagae, Aspadana and Ecbatana. In present-day Iran, that is the area between Tehran, Isfahan and Hamadan, respectively. Of the Median tribes, the Magi resided in Rhagae, modern Tehran. They were of a sacred caste which ministered to the spiritual needs of the Medes. The Paretaceni tribe resided in and around Aspadana, modern Isfahan, the Arizanti lived in and around Kashan (Isfahan Province), and the Busae tribe lived in and around the future Median capital of Ecbatana, near modern Hamadan. The Struchates and the Budii lived in villages in the Median triangle.

The family life of the Medes was based on patriarchal authority and polygamy was permitted. Strabo (Geogr. XI, 13.11) mentions a peculiar law applied to all Medes – a law requiring every man to have no fewer than five wives. It is very unlikely that such a burden would actually be obligatory on anyone: most likely only five lawful wives, and no more, were permitted by the aforementioned law, just as four wives, and no more, are legal for Muslims. The Medes had &quot;cities&quot;, probably small fortified settlements like those identified archaeologically. These locations were characterized by fortifications, warehouses, worship buildings, and ceremonial structures. The common population did not reside within these places, nor necessarily in immediate proximity; it is presumed they inhabited small villages or pastoral camps.

The Medes are portrayed in the reliefs of Persepolis, dating back to 515 BCE, just 35 years after the fall of the Median Kingdom. The reliefs depicting the Medes appear in three locations, showing guards, nobles, and their delegations. The reason for their frequent representation lies in the fact that the Medes held a privileged status in the Achaemenid Empire. The first relief shows four Medes and Persian spearmen. In this relief, the Medes wear short coats, trousers, and round caps, under which they seem to have curly hair.

=== Religion ===
Information about the religion of the Medes is very limited. Primary sources pointing to their religious affiliations include the archaeological discoveries in Tepe Nush-i Jan, personal names of Median individuals, and the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus. Between 1967 and 1977, David Stronach excavated a building at Tepe Nush-i Jan that had been built around 750 BC and appears to be mainly religious in character. The building was erected on a rock about 30 meters high and included a &quot;Central Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Western Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Fortress&quot; and &quot;Columned Hall&quot;, which were surrounded by a circular brick support wall. The Central Sanctuary was tower-shaped with a triangular inner altar. Its space is 11×7 meters and the walls are eight meters high. Near the west corner of the altar, a stepped fire altar constructed of mud bricks was discovered. As is known, the cult of fire was a common Indo-Iranian legacy. According to Herodotus, the Medes had a priestly caste called the Magi, who were one of the tribes of this people. They had the right or privilege to serve as priests not only for the Medes but also for the Persians. Thus, they constituted a priestly caste that passed its functions from father to son. They played a significant role in the court of the Median king Astyages, serving as advisers, sorcerers, dream interpreters, and soothsayers. Classical authors regarded the Magi as Zoroastrian priests. From the personal names of Medes as recorded by Assyrian texts from 8th and 9th centuries BCE there are examples of the use of the Indo-Iranian word &quot;arta-&quot; (lit. &quot;truth&quot;) or theophoric names with &quot;Maždakku&quot; and even the name of the god Ahura Mazda, which is familiar from both Avestan and Old Persian.

The religion promoted by the Magi could be some form of pre-Zoroastrianism or Zoroastrianism itself. This is a controversial topic on which scholars have not yet reached a consensus. Igor Diakonoff supposed that Astyages and perhaps even Cyaxares had already adopted a religion derived from the teachings of Zoroaster (although not necessarily identical with his doctrine). Mary Boyce argued that the existence of the Magi in Media with their own traditions and forms of worship was an obstacle to Zoroastrian proselytism there. Boyce wrote that the Zoroastrian traditions in the Median city of Ray probably goes back to the 8th century BCE. It is suggested that from the 8th century BCE, a form of &quot;Mazdaism with common Iranian traditions&quot; existed in Media and the strict reforms of Zarathustra began to spread in western Iran during the reign of the last Median kings in the 6th century BCE. It is also possible that the Medes may have practised Mithraism, with Mithra as their supreme deity.

=== Language ===

Median people spoke the Median language, which was an Old Iranian language. Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; (finished in the early first century) mentions the affinity of Median with other Iranian languages: &quot;The name of&quot; Ariana &quot;is further extended to a part of Persia and of Media, as also to the Bactrians and Sogdians on the north; for these speak approximately the same language, but with slight variations&quot;.

No original deciphered text has been proven to have been written in the Median language. It is suggested that similar to the later Iranian practice of keeping archives of written documents in Achaemenid Iran, there was also a maintenance of archives by the Median government in their capital Ecbatana. There are examples of &quot;Median literature&quot; found in later records. One is according to Herodotus that the Median king Deioces, appearing as a judge, made judgement on causes submitted in writing. There is also a report by Dinon on the existence of &quot;Median court poets&quot;. Median literature is part of the &quot;Old Iranian literature&quot; (including also Saka, Old Persian, Avestan) as this Iranian affiliation of them is explicit also in ancient texts, such as Herodotus&#x27;s account that many peoples including Medes were &quot;universally called Iranian&quot;.

No documents dated from the Median period have been preserved. Only one bronze plate dating from the pre-Achaemenid period has been found in Median territory, bearing a cuneiform inscription in Akkadian dating back to the 8th century BCE, but it does not mention any Median names. A cuneiform inscription on a piece of silver was excavated at Tepe Nush-i Jan, but only the end of one sign and the beginning of the next were preserved. If writing was employed by the Medes, it likely utilized a script similar to Aramaic that was written on perishable materials since no historical accounts, literary texts, bureaucratic records, or even commercial transaction records survived. Some small elements of the Median language have been reconstructed from place names, personal names, and some suggested Median linguistic remnants in Old Persian. Numerous non-Persian words in Old Persian texts are commonly assumed to be Median, and other Median forms are preserved in Akkadian versions of Achaemenid inscriptions and elsewhere. The Median words in Old Persian texts, whose Median origin can be established by &quot;phonetic criteria&quot;, appear more frequently among royal titles and among terms of the chancellery, military, and judicial affairs according to Rüdiger Schmitt. It&#x27;s likely that the Median language differed only dialectically from Old Persian.

=== Art and architecture ===

Very little remains of the material culture of the Medes, and it is challenging to confidently attribute artifacts from the period before the Persian Empire to the Medes specifically or to other groups residing in western Iran during the Iron Age. For this reason, Median art remains a purely speculative topic, and its existence is even denied by some scholars. Géza de Francovitch noted that there is not a single work conclusively of Median origin in the archaeological record. This observation appears to remain relevant, even after the excavation of two seemingly Median sites in western Iran and the emergence of more academic writings claiming to have unraveled and understood the characteristics of Median art. Still, other scholars presume that archaeological sites such as Tepe Nush-i Jan and Godin Tepe, located in Media and dating back to the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, are examples supporting the existence of Median art. Although Tepe Nush-i Jan was not a capital, according to David Stronach, it became a crucial link in a chain of evidence regarding the composition and development of Median architecture, as well as the incorporation of Median culture into ancient Eastern civilizations. Influence and direct borrowing of fine details, entire architectural forms, and building design that had precise analogs in Assyrian and Urartian art can be traced in the architecture of Tepe Nus-i Jã and Godin Tepe. The Medes not only borrowed some elements from foreign art but also used them in new contexts with new functions and meanings, that is, in a new context without their typical and initial qualities. Later, the Achaemenids borrowed cultural achievements from the ancient Near East through the Medes. J. Curtis argues against the minimalist position that there is nothing readily identifiable as Median art, but rather asserts that those objects that may be characterized as Median were heavily influenced by Assyrian art. Objects in a style halfway Assyrian, halfway Achaemenid, are often attributed to Median art.

Herodotus provides a description of the palace of Deioces in Ecbatana, stating that it was an architectural complex built on a hill and surrounded by seven concentric walls, with each battlement of a wall surpassing that of the wall next outside it. The palace itself and the royal treasures were located within the innermost circle. The battlements of these circles would have been painted with seven different colors, indicating that the Medes developed a rich polychrome; and the two innermost circles were covered with silver and gold, respectively. The artistic contributions of Median goldsmiths are also mentioned in Persian records.

Pictorial art has been excavated in small quantities and of somewhat disappointing quality so far. Evidence shows that Median pictorial art was heavily influenced by the Babylonians, Assyrians, Elamites, and perhaps the early phase of the &#x27;animal style&#x27; of the Ancient Near East. In Hamadan, a bronze plate was discovered with the inscription of a king of Abadana, a small kingdom west of Assyrian outposts. The plate depicts the king dressed similarly to Babylonian attire from the late Kassite period. Another inscribed object is a cylinder seal with a hero fighting a monster, the scene and inscription style related to the Elamite style in Susa, but the hero&#x27;s headdress is typical of the Medes in Achaemenid palace reliefs. Other findings include a crude-style cylinder seal impression from Nush-i Jan and cylinder seals in various Mesopotamian styles from the ruins and vicinity of Hamadan, some dating back to the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. These findings reveal a strong influence from other civilizations but lack distinctive traits of authentic Median art. Local craftsmanship is indicated by excavated bronze jars. Architectural painting, attested in both Baba Jan and Nush-i Jan, can be compared to the not-so-sophisticated geometric style found in Tepe Sialk. R. D. Barnett argued that the so-called Scythian style, more precisely the earliest phase of this style, was also part of contemporary Median art (late 8th century BCE). However, this theory has not been proven or refuted so far.

A passage from the &quot;Babylonian Chronicle&quot; records that after the conquest of Ecbatana, Cyrus took the silver, gold, goods, and properties of the city to Persia. While the exact nature of these precious metals and goods is not specified, except for being portable material, it is possible that Median artisanal objects, as well as state or religious items, were among the spoils.

Greek references to &quot;Median&quot; people make no clear distinction between the &quot;Persians&quot; and the &quot;Medians&quot;; in fact for a Greek to become &quot;too closely associated with Iranian culture&quot; was &quot;to become Medianized, not Persianized&quot;. The Median kingdom was a short-lived Iranian state and the textual and archaeological sources of that period are rare and little could be known from the Median culture.

=== Economy ===
The basic economic resource in the region was pastoralism, as indicated in the records of Assyrian raids and tributes. A primary factor for economic development was the breeding of valuable breeds, such as horses for military use and Bactrian camels for commercial transport. The proximity to the Assyrian Empire, as well as to Urartu, Elam, and Babylon, made the breeding of these animals highly profitable. However, the most crucial economic factor was the strategic location of the Medes along the main trade route, the Silk Road, connecting Mesopotamia to Central Asia.

Assyrian palace reliefs depict inhabitants of the eastern mountain regions wearing the same tunics, sheepskin coats, lace-up boot, and hairstyles. This visual evidence suggests a similarity in the lifeways of the Western Iranian peoples, with no apparent significant distinctions among the Medes and their neighbors. The only direct references to the Median lifestyle occur in a literary text from the 7th century BCE, known as the &quot;Sargon Geography&quot;, mentioning one Median chiefdom, Karzinu, reached by Assyrian forces in 716 BCE. As usual, non-Mesopotamian foreigners are characterized negatively, by listing the Assyrian cultural elements that the foreigners supposedly lacked. The description of the people of Karzinu makes it clear that they differed in quite a number of respects, including hairstyle, funerary practices, and diet, from the cultural habits of the western parts of the Assyrian Empire.

Median livestock breeders probably practiced transhumance, inhabiting their settlements in winter and spending the summer on pastures high in the mountains. The information gleaned from the Sargon campaign provides a rare reference to Median farming, suggesting a robust rural economy combining livestock breeding and farming, albeit lacking notable crafts or industries worth mentioning. The degree to which the Medes participated in the trade that passed through their territories between Mesopotamia and the lands further east is unknown. Assyrians received various goods from the Medes, including horses, mules, Bactrian camels, oxen, sheep, and goats. However, there is an absence of sophisticated finished products like precious textiles, metalwork, or furniture, and no luxury goods except for lapis lazuli.

The Medes were defined by their life in the Zagros Mountains. They sowed grain in the broad valleys and pastured their animals on the hillsides, moving from summer to winter pastures as the weather demanded. The Medes raised sheep, goat, and cattle for meat, milk, and wool, but it was the Median horses that were considered their most treasured resource. The Medes were known for their horsemanship, and when the Assyrians demanded tribute from them it was almost always in the form of horses trained for riding.

== Mythology ==
In the Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts, Medea is the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis and a paternal granddaughter of the sun-god Helios. Following her failed marriage to Jason while in Corinth, for one of several reasons depending on the version, she marries King Aegeus of Athens and bears a son Medus. After failing to make Aegeus kill his older son Theseus, she and her son fled to &quot;Aria&quot;, where the Medes take their name from her, according to several Greek and later Roman accounts, including in Pausanias&#x27; &quot;Description of Greece&quot; (1st-century AD). According to other versions, such as in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; (1st-century AD) and Justin&#x27;s &quot;Epitoma Historiarum Philippicarum&quot; (2nd or 3rd century AD), she returned home to conquer neighboring lands with her husband Jason, one of which was named after her; while another version related by Diodorus Siculus in &quot;Bibliotheca Historica&quot; (1st-century BC) states that after being exiled she married an Asian king and bore Medus, who was greatly admired for his courage, after whom they took their name.

== Kurds and Medes ==
Russian historian and linguist Vladimir Minorsky suggested that the Medes, who widely inhabited the land where currently the Kurds form a majority, might have been forefathers of the modern Kurds. He also states that the Medes who invaded the region in the eighth century BC linguistically resembled the Kurds. This view was accepted by many Kurdish nationalists in the twentieth century. However, Martin van Bruinessen, a Dutch scholar, argues against the attempt to identify the Medes as ancestors of the Kurds:

Though some Kurdish intellectuals claim that their people are descended from the Medes, there is no evidence to permit such a connection across the considerable gap in time between the political dominance of the Medes and the first attestation of the Kurds 
:—van Bruinessen

Contemporary linguistic evidence has challenged the previously suggested view that the Kurds are descendants of the Medes. Gernot Ludwig Windfuhr, professor of Iranian Studies, identified the Kurdish languages as Parthian, albeit with a Median substratum. David Neil MacKenzie, an authority on the Kurdish language, said Kurdish was closer to Persian and questioned the &quot;traditional&quot; view holding that Kurdish, because of its differences from Persian, should be regarded as a Northwestern Iranian language. The Kurdologist and Iranologist Garnik Asatrian stated that &quot;The Central Iranian dialects, and primarily those of the Kashan area in the first place, as well as the Azari dialects (otherwise called Southern Tati) are probably the only Iranian dialects, which can pretend to be the direct offshoots of Median... In general, the relationship between Kurdish and Median is not closer than the affinities between the latter and other North Western dialects – Baluchi, Talishi, South Caspian, Zaza, Gurani, Kurdish (Soranî, Kurmancî, Kelhorî). Asatrian also stated that &quot;there is no serious ground to suggest a special genetic affinity within North-Western Iranian between this ancient language [Median] and Kurdish. The latter does not share even the generally ephemeric peculiarity of Median.&quot;

According to Shahbazi, the Medes were ancestors of many Iranians, particularly the Kurds. To Jwaideh, &quot;The empire of the Medes, one of the reputed ancestors of the Kurdish people, was the only great national state that may be said to have been established by the Kurds.&quot;

According to &quot;The Cambridge History of the Kurds:&quot;

<text>Norma Rae is a 1979 American drama film directed by Martin Ritt from a screenplay written by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. The film is based on the true story of Crystal Lee Sutton – which was told in the 1975 book &quot;Crystal Lee, a Woman of Inheritance&quot; by reporter Henry P. Leifermann of &quot;The New York Times&quot; – and stars Sally Field in the title role. Beau Bridges, Ron Leibman, Pat Hingle, Barbara Baxley and Gail Strickland are featured in supporting roles. The film follows Norma Rae Webster, a factory worker with little formal education in North Carolina who, after she and her co-workers&#x27; health are compromised due to poor working conditions, becomes involved in trade union activities at the textile factory where she works.

&quot;Norma Rae&quot; premiered at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or, while Field won the Best Actress Prize. It was theatrically released by 20th Century-Fox on March 2, 1979, to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised the film&#x27;s direction, its screenplay, its message, and especially Field&#x27;s performance, while the film grossed $22 million on a production budget of $4.5 million. The film received four nominations at the 52nd Academy Awards including Best Picture and won two: Best Actress (for Field) and Best Original Song for its theme song &quot;It Goes Like It Goes&quot;. The film is considered &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically&quot; significant by the U.S. Library of Congress and was selected to be preserved in the National Film Registry in 2011.

== Plot ==
Norma Rae Wilson is a worker in a cotton mill that has taken too much of a toll on her family&#x27;s health for her to ignore their poor working conditions. She is also a single mother with two children by different fathers, one dead and the other negligent, and frequently has flings with other men to alleviate her loneliness and boredom. Initially, management tries to divert her frequent protests by promoting her to &quot;spot checker&quot;, where she is responsible for ensuring other workers are fulfilling work quotas. She reluctantly takes the job for the pay hike, but when fellow employees, including her father, shun her for effectively being a &quot;fink&quot; to the bosses, she demands to be fired. Instead, she is demoted back to the line.

Two men enter her life, and that changes her perspective. A former co-worker, Sonny Webster, asks her out after causing trouble for her at the mill. Divorced with a daughter, he proposes marriage after a short courtship; recognizing how long it has been since she met a non-selfish man with whom to keep company, she accepts his offer. After a few charged encounters with Reuben Warshowsky, a union organizer from New York City, Norma Rae listens to him deliver a speech that spurs her to join the effort to unionize her shop. This causes conflict when Sonny observes she&#x27;s not spending enough time at home and is frequently exhausted when she is present. When her father drops dead at the mill of a heart attack—a death that could have been averted had he been allowed to leave his post early instead of waiting for his allotted break—she is more determined to continue the fight.

Management retaliates against the unionization efforts, first by rearranging shifts so that workers are doing more work at less pay and then by posting fliers with racial invective in the hope of dividing white and black workers and diluting the momentum. Warshowsky demands Norma copy down the racist flier word for word to use it as evidence for government sanctions against her mill. When she attempts to transcribe the flier, management tries to stop her, then fires her on the grounds of creating a disturbance and calls the police to remove her from the mill. While awaiting the sheriff, Norma Rae takes a piece of cardboard, writes the word &quot;UNION&quot; on it, stands on her work table, and slowly turns to show the sign around the room. The other workers stop their mill machines one by one, and eventually, the room becomes silent. After all the machines have been switched off, Norma Rae is taken to jail but is freed by Reuben.

Upon returning home to her family, Norma decides to talk to her children and tell them the story of her life, their questionable parentage, and her recent arrest so they are prepared for any smears that may come from those hoping to discredit her efforts. After a tense exchange with Reuben, Sonny asks her if they have been intimate; she says no but acknowledges, &quot;he&#x27;s in my head.&quot; Sonny, in turn, tells her there&#x27;s no other woman in his head, and he will always remain with her.

An election to unionize the factory occurs. Norma and Reuben listen as best as possible from outside the mill as reporters and TV cameras observe the vote count. With a difference of just 100 votes, the union wins. Shortly after, Reuben says goodbye to Norma; despite being smitten with her, they shake hands because he knows she is married and loves her husband, and Reuben heads back to New York.

==Cast==
== Production ==
&quot;Norma Rae&quot; was filmed on location in Opelika, Alabama. The mill scenes were shot at the Opelika Manufacturing Corp., and the motel scenes were filmed at The Golden Cherry Motel.

=== Inspiration ===
The movie&#x27;s plot is based on events from the life of textile worker and union organiser Crystal Lee Sutton, who fought the J.P. Stevens Textiles mill in her hometown Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. The scene where Norma Rae writes &quot;UNION&quot; on a sheet of cardboard and stands on a table until her co-workers shut off their machines is closely based on a protest by Lee Sutton in 1978. Although Lee Sutton was fired from her job, the mill was unionized and she went to work as an organizer for the textile union. In 2003 the Stevens textile mill closed, along with hundreds of other similar factories across the Carolinas, as US textile manufacturing moved offshore to countries like China and Mexico.

==Reception==

&quot;Norma Rae&quot; received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 91% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Spearheaded by a galvanizing Sally Field, &quot;Norma Rae&quot; is a heartening and politically powerful drama about an ordinary woman taking an extraordinary stand.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on reviews from 47 critics.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Field&#x27;s performance, declaring that &quot;we are witnessing one of those unusual motion picture performances that seems to be in the process of taking off as we watch it ... Her triumph in &quot;Norma Rae&quot; is to have shucked off at long last all need to associate her with her TV beginnings, not because they are vulgar but because the performance she gives here is as big as the screen that presents it&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;Norma Rae&#x27; is a superb film. Paced by Sally Field&#x27;s best performance to date in a rapidly accelerating career, and under Martin Ritt&#x27;s firm but sensitive direction, the 20th Century-Fox release is that rare entity, an intelligent film with heart.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two and a half out of four, and praised Field for a &quot;thoroughly winning performance&quot;, but thought that Leibman gave a &quot;lousy, overbearing performance that, for me, wrecked the movie&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a wonderful and—for want of a better word—judicious work&quot;.

Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote &quot;This picture is historically fascinating in what it tells us of the labor movement, and it does honor to a particular sort of involved character who will not be intimidated. Well done.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that &quot;Sally Field embodies the title character with considerable sincerity&quot;, but that the film &quot;comes so unraveled that in retrospect the images of loose strands of fiber in the air seem more significant than the character of the heroine or the bleak factory environment. The screenplay by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. ... turns out to be a pile of loose thematic and emotional strands&quot;.

Tom Milne of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote &quot;Heart-warming is probably the word for &quot;Norma Rae,&quot; a film which leaves no cliché unturned in its cosy efforts to demonstrate how a woman no better than she ought to be becomes better than most of us.&quot;

<doc id="103042" wikidata="Q1057026" url="?curid=103042" title="Cargo airline">
<text>Cargo airlines (or air freight carriers, and derivatives of these names) are airlines mainly dedicated to the transport of cargo by air. Some cargo airlines are divisions or subsidiaries of larger passenger airlines.
In 2018, airline cargo traffic represented 262,333 million tonne-kilometres with a 49.3% load factor: % for dedicated cargo operations, and % within mixed operations (belly freight of passenger airliners).

==Pilots==

A higher proportion of cargo flights are red-eye (overnight flights) than passenger flights. Compared to passenger airline pilots, cargo pilots are paid less but do not have to be responsible for passengers. Cargo pilots also have better job security due to air freight demand being more stable, as opposed to passenger airlines which often furlough their pilots in response to falling passenger demand.

==Freight rates==

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, adjusted cargo capacity fell by 4.4% in February while air cargo demand also fell by 9.1%, but the near-halt in passenger traffic cut capacity even deeper as half of global air cargo is carried in passenger jets’ bellies.
Air freight rates rose as a consequence, from $0.80 per kg for transatlantic cargoes to $2.50-4 per kg, enticing passenger airlines to operate cargo-only flights through the use of preighters, while cargo airlines bring back into service fuel-guzzling stored aircraft, helped by falling oil prices.

==Logistics==
Air transport is a component of many international logistics networks, managing and controlling the flow of goods, energy, information and other resources like products, services, and people, from the source of production to the marketplace. Logistics involves the geographical repositioning of raw materials, work in process, and finished inventories.

==Aircraft used==

Larger cargo airlines tend to use new or recently built aircraft to carry their freight. Current passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 offer freighter variants either from new the factory or as a conversion. Compared to the passenger variant, the freighter has a supernumerary area, which includes four business-class seats forward of the rigid cargo barrier, full main deck access, bunks, and a galley. Passenger planes converted to freighters have their windows plugged, passenger doors deactivated, fuselage and floor reinforced, and a main-deck cargo door installed.

Many cargo airlines still utilize older aircraft, including those no longer suited for passenger service, like the Boeing 707, Boeing 727, Douglas DC-8, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, McDonnell Douglas MD-11, Airbus A300, and the Ilyushin Il-76. Examples of the 80+-year-old Douglas DC-3 are still flying around the world carrying cargo (as well as passengers). Short range turboprop airliners such as the Antonov An-12, Antonov An-26, Fokker Friendship, and British Aerospace ATP are being modified to accept standard air freight pallets to extend their working lives. This normally involves the replacement of glazed windows with opaque panels, the strengthening of the cabin floor and insertion of a broad top-hinged door in one side of the fuselage.

The Antonov An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot;, an enlarged version of the Antonov An-124 &quot;Ruslan&quot;, was the world&#x27;s largest aircraft, used for transporting large shipments and oversized cargos.

Usage of large military airplanes for commercial purposes, pioneered by Ukraine&#x27;s Antonov Airlines in the 1990s, has allowed new types of cargo in aerial transportation.

=== Passenger and cargo ===
In the past, some cargo airlines would carry a few passengers from time to time on flights, and UPS Airlines once unsuccessfully tried a passenger charter airline division. 

Passenger airlines regularly use their largest passenger aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER to earn additional revenue beyond passengers on a scheduled flight, by transporting a limited amount of cargo alongside passengers&#x27; luggage underneath the passenger cabin. This is known as mixed operations or belly freight, and makes up % airline cargo traffic as of 2018. Alaska Airlines operates a series of short flights nicknamed the &quot;Milk Run&quot; to small towns in Southeast Alaska that do not have road access, using five Boeing 737-400 Combi aircraft whose cabin is divided in half with cargo up front and 72 seats in the back.

===Largest cargo carriers===

Some more large cargo carriers are:
===All-cargo subsidiary===
The following are freight divisions of passenger airlines operating their own or leased freighter aircraft. Some have shut down or merged with others:
The following are freight divisions without freighter fleets, using passenger aircraft holds or having other cargo airlines fly on their behalf. Some of these previously had freighters:

These carriers operate freighter aircraft but do not have cargo divisions:

These carriers operate freighter aircraft exclusively

<text>Katherine Seymour, Countess of Hertford ( Lady Katherine Grey; 25 August 1540 – 26 January 1568) was a younger sister of Lady Jane Grey.

A granddaughter of Henry VIII&#x27;s sister Mary, she emerged as a prospective successor to her cousin, Elizabeth I of England, before incurring Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s wrath by secretly marrying Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford. Arrested after the Queen was informed of their clandestine marriage, Katherine (&quot;as&quot; Lady Hertford) lived in captivity until her death, having borne two sons in the Tower of London.

==Family and claim to the throne==
Lady Katherine was born on 25 August 1540 at Bradgate Park, near Leicester, the second surviving daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, by his marriage to Lady Frances Brandon. She was the younger sister of Lady Jane Grey and elder sister of Lady Mary Grey. Katherine Grey&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France, youngest surviving daughter of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.

Through their grandmother, the Grey sisters had a close claim in the line of succession to the English throne. They were preceded in the line of succession only by Henry VIII&#x27;s three children – Prince Edward, Lady Mary and Lady Elizabeth – and the descendants of Princess Margaret, the elder daughter of Henry VII and Queen Consort of Scotland, after 1542 represented by Mary, Queen of Scots. However, Henry VIII had excluded the Scottish regal line from the English succession in his Will, placing the Grey sisters next-in-line after his own children.

==First marriage==
Some time before August 1552, Katherine Grey was betrothed to Henry, Lord Herbert, heir apparent to William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. In 1553, as King Edward VI was dying, the King and his Chief Minister, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, planned to exclude Edward&#x27;s sister Mary Tudor from the succession in favour of Katherine&#x27;s elder sister, Lady Jane Grey. According to the Letters Patent of 21 June 1553, Lady Katherine was to be second in the line of succession behind her sister and heirs-male. Lady Jane had been married to Northumberland&#x27;s son, Lord Guildford Dudley, on 25 May 1553. On the same occasion, Lady Katherine was married to Lord Herbert at Durham House. After the wedding, Katherine (&quot;now&quot; Lady Herbert) went to live with her husband at Baynard&#x27;s Castle beside the Thames. When Lady Jane&#x27;s accession to the throne failed, Henry&#x27;s father sought to distance himself from the Grey family by separating his son from Lady Katherine and seeking the annulment of the marriage; this was probably achieved in early 1554, as the union had not been consummated. Meanwhile, her sister (Lady Jane Grey) and her father (the Duke of Suffolk) had been executed in February 1554 after the suppression of Wyatt&#x27;s Rebellion.

==Prospective royal heir under Mary I and Elizabeth I==
During the first phase of Queen Mary I&#x27;s reign, Lady Katherine was senior heir-in-line to the throne as Mary was yet unmarried and her younger sister Elizabeth was regarded as illegitimate. Demoted when Elizabeth was declared heir, Lady Katherine&#x27;s claim came to the fore again when Queen Elizabeth I acceded to the English throne in November 1558. At one point the Queen was apparently contemplating Lady Katherine Grey as a potential Protestant heir, with rumours of a possible adoption, but any such development was terminated upon Lady Katherine&#x27;s clandestine marriage to Lord Hertford.

==Second marriage==

One of Lady Katherine&#x27;s friends, Lady Jane Seymour, daughter of the Duke of Somerset, introduced her brother, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, to Lady Katherine Grey (so restyled after the annulment of her first marriage). Without royal assent, the two were married in December 1560 during a secret ceremony at Lord Hertford&#x27;s house in Cannon Row, where Lady Jane Seymour was the sole witness.

Soon thereafter, the Queen despatched Lord Hertford with Thomas Cecil, eldest son of Sir William Cecil, on a grand tour across Europe &quot;for the improvement of their education&quot;. The Earl of Hertford provided his wife with a document that would, in the event of his death, enable her to prove the marriage and inherit his property, but apparently Katherine lost the document. Thus, after Lady Jane Seymour died of tuberculosis in 1561, Katherine was unable to prove that they had ever been married.

==Imprisonment==
Katherine concealed the marriage from everyone for months, even after she became pregnant; in her eighth month of pregnancy and on progress with the royal court to Ipswich, she decided to ask someone to plead for her with the Queen. She first confided in Bess of Hardwick, who refused to listen to Katherine and berated her for implicating her. Katherine then went to her late sister&#x27;s brother-in-law, Robert Dudley. Visiting his bedroom in the middle of the night, she explained her dilemma. As Dudley&#x27;s room adjoined the Queen&#x27;s chambers, he was afraid they might be overheard or that he might be caught with a visibly pregnant woman at his bedside, and tried to get rid of Katherine as soon as he could. The next day he told Elizabeth everything he knew regarding Katherine and her pregnancy.

Queen Elizabeth was infuriated that her cousin had married without her knowledge or consent. The marriage also upset Anglo-Scottish diplomacy, as the possibility of a union between Lady Katherine and the Earl of Arran, a young and unstable nobleman with a strong claim to the Scottish throne, had thereby been removed as an option. The Queen also disapproved of her choice of husband and, still unmarried, also feared that Katherine&#x27;s ability to bear male offspring could possibly facilitate a rebellion in support of Katherine as queen. To Katherine&#x27;s misfortune, her claim to the throne was at the time argued by a book written by John Hales.

Queen Elizabeth imprisoned Lady Katherine in the Tower of London, where Edward Seymour (Lord Hertford) was sent to join her on his return to England. Bess of Hardwick was also imprisoned, as Elizabeth had become convinced (not without reason) that the marriage was part of a wider conspiracy against the Crown. Sir Edward Warner, Lieutenant of The Tower, permitted secret visits between Katherine and Edward. Warner reported that the furnishings of Katherine&#x27;s room, which were provided from the Royal Wardrobe in the Tower, had been damaged by her pet monkey and dogs. While imprisoned in the Tower, Katherine gave birth to two sons:

* Edward Seymour (1561–1612)
* Thomas Seymour (1562/3, Tower of London – 8 August 1600). Baptized on 11 February 1563, he married Isabel Onley (d. 20 August 1619), daughter of Edward Onley , of Catesby, Northamptonshire. The couple had no issue, and were buried at St. Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster, where there is a monument with effigies in their memory.

In 1562, the marriage was annulled and the Seymours were censured as fornicators for &quot;carnal copulation&quot; by the Archbishop of Canterbury. This rendered the children illegitimate and thereby ineligible as successors to the throne. Nonetheless, this did not stop their being courted as potential heirs to the Crown.

==Final years==
After the birth of Katherine&#x27;s second child in 1563, the enraged Queen ordered her permanent separation from her husband and elder son. Katherine was removed to the care of her uncle, Sir John Grey, at Pirgo. She stayed there until November 1564, when she was transferred to the charge of Sir William Petre. For two years she was in his custody, and probably resided at Ingatestone Hall; then she was removed to the care of Sir John Wentworth (a kinsman of Petre&#x27;s first wife) at Gosfield Hall, and after seventeen months&#x27; confinement there was taken to Cockfield Hall, Yoxford, in Suffolk.

There, Lady Katherine died fourteen days later on 26 January 1568 at the age of twenty-seven of consumption. She was interred at the Cockfield Chapel in Yoxford Church, Suffolk, before her body was moved to Salisbury Cathedral to be buried alongside her husband.

== Family tree ==
The following chart illustrates Lady Katherine Grey&#x27;s relationship to the House of Tudor and other claimants to the English throne. Italics indicate people who predeceased Edward VI; Arabic numerals indicate the line of succession to Edward VI at the time of his death according to Henry VIII&#x27;s will; and Roman numerals indicate the line of succession at the time of Edward VI&#x27;s death according to Edward&#x27;s will.

<doc id="103050" wikidata="Q179543" url="?curid=103050" title="Iapetus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Iapetus (; ; ), also Japetus, is a Titan, the son of Uranus and Gaia and father of Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius. He was also called the father of Buphagus and Anchiale in other sources.

Iapetus was linked to Japheth (), one of the sons of Noah and a progenitor of mankind in biblical accounts. The practice by early historians and biblical scholars of identifying various historical nations and ethnic groups as descendants of Japheth, together with the similarity of their names, led to a fusion of their identities, from the early modern period to the present.

==Mythology==
Iapetus (&quot;the Piercer&quot;) is the one Titan mentioned by Homer in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as being in Tartarus with Cronus. He is a brother of Cronus, who ruled the world during the Golden Age but is now locked up in Tartarus along with Iapetus, where neither breeze nor light of the sun reaches them.

Iapetus&#x27; wife is usually described as a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys named either Clymene (according to Hesiod and Hyginus) or Asia (according to Apollodorus).

In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, Prometheus is addressed as &quot;son of Iapetus&quot;, and no mother is named. However, in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Clymene is listed as Iapetus&#x27; wife and the mother of Prometheus. In Aeschylus&#x27;s play &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, Prometheus is son of the goddess Themis with no father named (but still with at least Atlas as a brother). However, in Horace&#x27;s Odes, in Ode 1.3 Horace writes &quot;audax Iapeti genus ... Ignem fraude mala gentibus intulit&quot; (&quot;The bold offspring of Iapetus [i.e. Prometheus] ... brought fire to peoples by wicked deceit&quot;).

Hesiod and other Greek scholars regarded the sons of Iapetus as mankind&#x27;s ancestors and as such, some of humanity&#x27;s worst qualities were said to have been inherited from these four gods, each of whom were described with a particular moral fault that often led to their own downfall. For instance, sly and clever Prometheus could perhaps represent crafty scheming; the inept and guileless Epimetheus, foolish stupidity; the enduring, strongest and powerful Atlas, excessive daring; and the arrogant Menoetius, rash violence.

Iapetus as the progenitor of mankind has been equated with Japheth (), the son of Noah, based on the similarity of their names and the tradition, reported by Josephus (&quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;), which made Japheth the ancestor of the &quot;Japhetites&quot;, i.e. the Indo-European speaking peoples. Iapetus was linked to Japheth by 17th-century theologian Matthew Poole (and more recently by Robert Graves) and by John Pairman Brown.

<doc id="103051" wikidata="Q17958" url="?curid=103051" title="Iapetus (moon)">
<text>Iapetus () is the outermost of Saturn&#x27;s large moons. With an estimated diameter of , it is the third-largest moon of Saturn and the eleventh-largest in the Solar System. Named after the Titan Iapetus, the moon was discovered in 1671 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.

A relatively low-density body made up mostly of ice, Iapetus is home to several distinctive and unusual features, such as a striking difference in coloration between its leading hemisphere, which is dark, and its trailing hemisphere, which is bright, as well as a massive equatorial ridge running three-quarters of the way around the moon.

==History==
=== Discovery ===

Iapetus was discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, an Italian-born French astronomer, in October 1671. This is the first moon that Cassini discovered; the second moon of Saturn to be discovered after Christaan Huygens spotted Titan 16 years prior in 1655; and the sixth extraterrestrial moon to be discovered in human history.

Cassini discovered Iapetus when the moon was on the western side of Saturn, but when he tried viewing it on the eastern side some months later, he was unsuccessful. This was also the case the following year, when he was again able to observe it on the western side, but not the eastern side. Cassini finally observed Iapetus on the eastern side in 1705 with the help of an improved telescope, finding it two magnitudes dimmer on that side.

Cassini correctly surmised that Iapetus has a bright hemisphere and a dark hemisphere, and that it is tidally locked, always keeping the same face towards Saturn. This means that the bright hemisphere is visible from Earth when Iapetus is on the western side of Saturn, and that the dark hemisphere is visible when Iapetus is on the eastern side.

=== Name ===
Iapetus is named after the Titan Iapetus from Greek mythology. The name was suggested by John Herschel (son of William Herschel) in his 1847 publication &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope&quot;, in which he advocated naming the moons of Saturn after the Titans, brothers and sisters of the Titan Cronus (whom the Romans equated with their god Saturn); and Giants, the massive but lesser relatives of the Titans who sided with the Titans against Zeus and the Olympian Gods.

The name has a largely obsolete variant, Japetus ,
with an adjectival form &quot;Japetian&quot;.
These occurred because there was no distinction between the letters and in Latin, and authors rendered them differently.

When first discovered, Iapetus was among the four Saturnian moons labelled the &quot;Sidera Lodoicea&quot; by their discoverer Giovanni Cassini after King Louis XIV (the other three were Tethys, Dione and Rhea). However, astronomers fell into the habit of referring to them using Roman numerals, with Iapetus being Saturn V because it was the fifth known Saturnian moon in order of distance from Saturn at that time. Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended and Iapetus became Saturn VII. With the discovery of Hyperion in 1848, Iapetus became Saturn VIII, which is still its Roman numerical designation today. Geological features on Iapetus are generally named after characters and places from the French epic poem &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;.

== Orbit ==

The orbit of Iapetus is somewhat unusual. Although it is Saturn&#x27;s third-largest moon, it orbits much farther from Saturn than the next closest major moon, Titan. It also has the most inclined orbital plane of the regular satellites; only the irregular outer satellites like Phoebe have more inclined orbits. Because of this distant, inclined orbit, Iapetus is the only large moon from which the rings of Saturn would be clearly visible; from the other inner moons, the rings would be edge-on and difficult to see. The cause of this highly inclined orbit is unknown; however, the moon is not likely to have been captured. One suggestion for the cause of Iapetus&#x27;s orbital inclination is an encounter between Saturn and another planet in the distant past.

Despite being, on average, 2.4 times further from Saturn than Hyperion, the next moon inward, Iapetus is tidally locked to Saturn while Hyperion is not.

==Formation==
The moons of Saturn are typically thought to have formed through co-accretion, a similar process to that believed to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. However, a proposed model on the formation of Titan suggests that Titan was instead formed in a series of giant impacts between pre-existing moons. Iapetus and Rhea are thought to have formed from part of the debris of these collisions. More-recent studies, however, suggest that all of Saturn&#x27;s moons inward of Titan are no more than 100 million years old; thus, Iapetus is unlikely to have formed in the same series of collisions as Rhea and all the other moons inward of Titan, and—along with Titan—may be a primordial satellite.

== Physical characteristics ==

The low density of Iapetus indicates that it is mostly composed of ice, with only a small (~20%) amount of rocky materials.

Unlike most of the large moons, its overall shape is neither spherical nor ellipsoid, but has a bulging waistline and squashed poles. Its unique equatorial ridge (see below) is so high that it visibly distorts Iapetus&#x27;s shape even when viewed from a distance. These features often lead it to be characterized as walnut-shaped.

Iapetus is heavily cratered, and &quot;Cassini&quot; images have revealed large impact basins, at least five of which are over wide. The largest, Turgis, has a diameter of ; its rim is extremely steep and includes a scarp about high.
Iapetus is known to support long-runout landslides or sturzstroms, possibly supported by ice sliding.

=== Two-tone coloration ===

The difference in colouring between the two Iapetian hemispheres is striking. The leading hemisphere and sides are dark (albedo 0.03–0.05) with a slight reddish-brown coloring, while most of the trailing hemisphere and poles are bright (albedo 0.5–0.6, almost as bright as Europa). Thus, the apparent magnitude of the trailing hemisphere is around 10.2, whereas that of the leading hemisphere is around 11.9—beyond the capacity of the best telescopes in the 17th century. The dark region is named Cassini Regio, and the bright region is divided into Roncevaux Terra north of the equator, and Saragossa Terra south of it. The original dark material is believed to have come from outside Iapetus, but now it consists principally of lag from the sublimation (evaporation) of ice from the warmer areas of the moon&#x27;s surface, further darkened by exposure to sunlight. It contains organic compounds similar to the substances found in primitive meteorites or on the surfaces of comets; Earth-based observations have shown it to be carbonaceous, and it probably includes cyano-compounds such as frozen hydrogen cyanide polymers.

Images from the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter, which passed within , show that both Cassini Regio and the Terra&#x27;s are heavily cratered. The color dichotomy of scattered patches of light and dark material in the transition zone between Cassini Regio and the bright areas exists at very small scales, down to the imaging resolution of . There is dark material filling in low-lying regions, and light material on the weakly illuminated pole-facing slopes of craters, but no shades of grey. The dark material is a very thin layer, only a few tens of centimeters (approx. one foot) thick at least in some areas, according to Cassini radar imaging and the fact that very small meteor impacts have punched through to the ice underneath.

Because of its slow rotation of 79 days (equal to its revolution and the longest in the Saturnian system), Iapetus would have had the warmest daytime surface temperature and coldest nighttime temperature in the Saturnian system even before the development of the color contrast; near the equator, heat absorption by the dark material results in a daytime temperatures of in the dark Cassini Regio compared to in the bright regions. The difference in temperature means that ice preferentially sublimates from Cassini Regio, and deposits in the bright areas and especially at the even colder poles. Over geologic time scales, this would further darken Cassini Regio and brighten the rest of Iapetus, creating a positive feedback thermal runaway process of ever greater contrast in albedo, ending with all exposed ice being lost from Cassini Regio. It is estimated that over a period of one billion years at current temperatures, dark areas of Iapetus would lose about of ice to sublimation, while the bright regions would lose only , not considering the ice transferred from the dark regions. This model explains the distribution of light and dark areas, the absence of shades of grey, and the thinness of the dark material covering Cassini Regio. The redistribution of ice is facilitated by Iapetus&#x27;s weak gravity, which means that at ambient temperatures a water molecule can migrate from one hemisphere to the other in just a few hops.

However, a separate process of color segregation would be required to get the thermal feedback started. The initial dark material is thought to have been debris blasted by meteors off small outer moons in retrograde orbits and swept up by the leading hemisphere of Iapetus. The core of this model is some 30 years old, and was revived by the September 2007 flyby.

Light debris outside of Iapetus&#x27;s orbit, either knocked free from the surface of a moon by micrometeoroid impacts or created in a collision, would spiral in as its orbit decays. It would have been darkened by exposure to sunlight. A portion of any such material that crossed Iapetus&#x27;s orbit would have been swept up by its leading hemisphere, coating it; once this process created a modest contrast in albedo, and so a contrast in temperature, the thermal feedback described above would have come into play and exaggerated the contrast. In support of the hypothesis, simple numerical models of the exogenic deposition and thermal water redistribution processes can closely predict the two-toned appearance of Iapetus. A subtle color dichotomy between Iapetus&#x27;s leading and trailing hemispheres, with the former being more reddish, can in fact be observed in comparisons between both bright and dark areas of the two hemispheres. In contrast to the elliptical shape of Cassini Regio, the color contrast closely follows the hemisphere boundaries; the gradation between the differently colored regions is gradual, on a scale of hundreds of kilometers. The next moon inward from Iapetus, chaotically rotating Hyperion, also has an unusual reddish color.

The largest reservoir of such infalling material is Phoebe, the largest of the outer moons. Although Phoebe&#x27;s composition is closer to that of the bright hemisphere of Iapetus than the dark one, dust from Phoebe would only be needed to establish a contrast in albedo, and presumably would have been largely obscured by later sublimation. The discovery of a tenuous disk of material in the plane of and just inside Phoebe&#x27;s orbit was announced on 6 October 2009, supporting the model. The disk extends from 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn, while Phoebe orbits at an average distance of 215 Saturn radii. It was detected with the Spitzer Space Telescope.

=== Overall shape ===
Current triaxial measurements of Iapetus give it radial dimensions of , with a mean radius of . However, these measurements may be inaccurate on the kilometer scale as Iapetus&#x27;s entire surface has not yet been imaged in high enough resolution. The observed oblateness would be consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium if Iapetus had a rotational period of approximately 16 hours, but it does not; its current rotation period is 79 days. A possible explanation for this is that the shape of Iapetus was frozen by formation of a thick crust shortly after its formation, while its rotation continued to slow afterwards due to tidal dissipation, until it became tidally locked.

=== Equatorial ridge ===
A further mystery of Iapetus is the equatorial ridge that runs along the center of Cassini Regio, about long, wide, and high. It was discovered when the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft imaged Iapetus on December 31, 2004, although its existence had been inferred from the moon&#x27;s polar images by Voyager 2. Peaks in the ridge rise more than above the surrounding plains, making them some of the tallest mountains in the Solar System. The ridge forms a complex system including isolated peaks, segments of more than and sections with three near parallel ridges. Within the bright regions there is no ridge, but there are a series of isolated peaks along the equator. The ridge system is heavily cratered, indicating that it is ancient. The prominent equatorial bulge gives Iapetus a walnut-like appearance.

It is not clear how the ridge formed. One difficulty is to explain why it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are many hypotheses, but none explain why the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio. Theories include that the ridge is a remnant of Iapetus&#x27;s oblate shape during its early life, that it was created by the collapse of a ring system, that it was formed by icy material welling from Iapetus&#x27;s interior, or that it is a result of convective overturn.

== Exploration ==

The first spacecraft to visit Saturn, Pioneer 11, did not provide any images of Iapetus and it came no closer than from the moon. Nonetheless, Pioneer 11 was humanity&#x27;s first attempt to obtain direct measurements from the objects within the Saturnian system.

Voyager 1 arrived at Saturn on November 12, 1980, and it became the first probe to return pictures of Iapetus that clearly show the moon&#x27;s two-tone appearance from a distance of as it was exiting the Saturnian system.
Voyager 2 became the next probe to visit Saturn on August 22, 1981, and made its closest approach to Iapetus at a distance of . It took photos of Iapetus&#x27;s north pole as it entered the Saturnian system - opposite the approach direction of Voyager 1.

The latest probe to visit Iapetus was the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter which went into orbit around Saturn starting on July 1, 2004. Iapetus has been imaged many times from moderate distances by &quot;Cassini&quot; but its great distance from Saturn makes close observation difficult.

&quot;Cassini&quot; made its first targeted flyby of Iapetus on Dec. 31, 2004, at a distance of around the time when the spacecraft was settling in its orbit around Saturn. &quot;Cassini&quot; did not cross Iapetus&#x27;s orbit when it flew by and remained inside the moon&#x27;s orbit. &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; subsequent flybys of Titan would make the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit smaller, preventing Cassini from flying close to Iapetus for months.

&quot;Cassini&quot; made a second flyby of Iapetus on November 12, 2005, at a distance of , also without crossing the moon&#x27;s orbit.

&quot;Cassini&quot; then made a third and more distant flyby of Iapetus on January 22, 2006, at a distance of .

The fourth flyby happened on April 8, 2006, at a distance of approximately , and this time, Cassini crossed Iapetus&#x27; orbit. After this, &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; orbit was made smaller once again, preventing the probe from approaching Iapetus for more than a year this time.

&quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; closest flyby of Iapetus happened on September 10, 2007, at a minimum range of . It approached Iapetus from its night side.

After this encounter, &quot;Cassini&quot; made no further targeted flybys of Iapetus.

<text>The Tuareg people (; also spelled Twareg or Touareg; endonym: Imuhaɣ/Imušaɣ/Imašeɣăn/Imajeɣăn) are a large Berber ethnic group, traditionally nomadic pastoralists, who principally inhabit the Sahara in a vast area stretching from far southwestern Libya to southern Algeria, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and as far as northern Nigeria.

The Tuareg speak languages of the same name, also known as &quot;Tamasheq&quot;, which belong to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.

They are a semi-nomadic people who mostly practice Islam, and are descended from the indigenous Berber communities of Northern Africa, whose ancestry has been described as a mosaic of local Northern African (Taforalt), Middle Eastern, European (Early European Farmers), and Sub-Saharan African, prior to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. Some researchers have tied the origin of the Tuareg ethnicity with the fall of the Garamantes who inhabited the Fezzan (Libya) from the 1st millennium BC to the 5th century AD. Tuareg people are credited with spreading Islam in North Africa and the adjacent Sahel region.

Tuareg social structure has traditionally included clan membership, social status and caste hierarchies within each political confederation. The Tuareg have controlled several trans-Saharan trade routes and have been an important party to the conflicts in the Saharan region during the colonial and post-colonial eras.

==Names==
The origins and meanings of the name &quot;Tuareg&quot; have long been debated. It would appear that &quot;Twārəg&quot; is derived from the broken plural of &quot;Tārgi&quot;, a name whose former meaning was &quot;inhabitant of &quot;Targa&quot;&quot;, the Tuareg name of the Libyan region commonly known as Fezzan. &quot;Targa&quot; in Berber means &quot;(drainage) channel&quot;. Another theory is that Tuareg is derived from &quot;Tuwariq&quot;, the plural of the Arabic exonym &quot;Tariqi&quot;.

The term for a Tuareg man is &quot;Amajagh&quot; (variants: &quot;Amashegh&quot;, &quot;Amahagh&quot;), the term for a woman &quot;Tamajaq&quot; (variants: &quot;Tamasheq&quot;, &quot;Tamahaq&quot;, &quot;Timajaghen&quot;). Spellings of the appellation vary by Tuareg dialect. They all reflect the same linguistic root, expressing the notion of &quot;freemen&quot;. As such, the endonym strictly refers only to the Tuareg nobility, not the artisanal client castes and the slaves. Two other Tuareg self-designations are &quot;Kel Tamasheq&quot;, meaning &quot;speakers of Tamasheq&quot;, and &quot;Kel Tagelmust&quot;, meaning &quot;veiled people&quot; in allusion to the tagelmust garment that is traditionally worn by Tuareg men.

The English exonym &quot;Blue People&quot; is similarly derived from the indigo color of the tagelmust veils and other clothing, which sometimes stains the skin underneath giving it a blueish tint. Another term for the Tuareg is &quot;Imuhagh&quot; or &quot;Imushagh&quot;, a cognate to the northern Berber self-name &quot;Imazighen&quot;.

==Demography and languages==

The Tuareg today inhabit a vast area in the Sahara, stretching from far southwestern Libya to southern Algeria, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and the far north of Nigeria. Their combined population in these territories exceeds 2.5 million, with an estimated population in Niger of around 2 million (11% of inhabitants) and in Mali of another 0.5 million (3% of inhabitants).

The Tuareg are the majority ethnic group in the Kidal Region of northeastern Mali.

The Tuareg traditionally speak the Tuareg languages, also known as &quot;Tamasheq, Tamajeq&quot; or &quot;Tamahaq&quot;, depending on the dialect. These languages belong to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family. According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, there are an estimated 1.2 million Tuareg speakers. Around half of this number consists of speakers of the eastern dialect (&quot;Tamajaq&quot;, &quot;Tawallammat&quot;). 

The exact number of Tuareg speakers per territory is uncertain. The CIA estimates that the Tuareg population in Mali constitutes approximately 0.9% of the national population (~150,000), whereas about 3.5% of local inhabitants speak Tuareg (Tamasheq) as a primary language. In contrast, Imperato (2008) estimates that the Tuareg represent around 3% of Mali&#x27;s population.

==History==

===Early history===
In antiquity, the Tuareg moved southward from the Tafilalt region into the Sahel under the Tuareg founding queen Tin Hinan, who is believed to have lived between the 4th and 5th centuries. The matriarch&#x27;s 1,500-year-old monumental Tin Hinan tomb is located in the Sahara at Abalessa in the Hoggar Mountains of southern Algeria. Vestiges of an inscription in Tifinagh, the Tuareg&#x27;s traditional Libyco-Berber writing script, have been found on one of the ancient sepulchre&#x27;s walls.

External accounts of interactions with the Tuareg are available from at least the 10th century onwards. Ibn Hawkal (10th century), El-Bekri (11th century), Edrisi (12th century), Ibn Battutah (14th century), and Leo Africanus (16th century) all documented the Tuareg in some form, usually as Mulatthamin or &quot;the veiled ones&quot;. Of the early historians, fourteenth century scholar Ibn Khaldûn probably wrote some of the most detailed commentary on the life and people of the Sahara, though he apparently never actually met them.

===Colonial era===
At the turn of the 19th century, the Tuareg territory was organised into confederations, each ruled by a supreme Chief (&quot;Amenokal&quot;), along with a council of elders from each tribe. These confederations were sometimes called &quot;Drum Groups&quot; after the Amenokal&#x27;s symbol of authority, a drum. Clan (&quot;Tewsit&quot;) elders, called Imegharan (wisemen), were chosen to assist the chief of the confederation. Historically, there have been seven major confederations.

* &quot;Kel Ajjer&quot; or Azjar: centred in the oasis of Aghat (Ghat).
* &quot;Kel Ahaggar&quot;, in Ahaggar mountains.
* &quot;Kel Adagh&quot;, or &quot;Kel Assuk&quot;: Kidal and Timbuktu
* &quot;Iwillimmidan Kel Ataram&quot; or &quot;Western Iwillimmidan&quot;: Ménaka and Azawagh regions (Mali)
* &quot;Iwillimmidan Kel Denneg&quot;, or &quot;Eastern Iwillimmidan&quot;: Tchin-Tabaraden, Abalagh, Teliya Azawagh (Niger).
* &quot;Kel Ayr&quot;: Assodé, Agadez, In Gal, Timia and Ifrwan.
* &quot;Kel Gres&quot;: Zinder and Tanut (Tanout) and south into northern Nigeria.
* &quot;Kel Owey&quot;: Aïr Massif, seasonally south to Tessaoua (Niger)

In the mid-19th century, descriptions of the Tuareg and their way of life were made by the English traveller James Richardson in his journeys across the Libyan Sahara in 1845–1846.
In the late 19th century, the Tuareg resisted the French colonial invasion of their central Saharan homelands and annihilated a French expedition led by Paul Flatters in 1881. Over decades of fighting, Tuareg broadswords were no match for the firearms of French troops.

After numerous massacres on both sides, the Tuareg were defeated and forced to sign treaties in Mali in 1905 and Niger in 1917. In southern Algeria, the French met some of the strongest resistance from the Ahaggar Tuareg. Their &quot;Amenokal&quot; chief Moussa ag Amastan fought numerous battles, but eventually Tuareg territories were subdued under French governance.

French colonial administration of the Tuareg was largely based on supporting the existing social hierarchy. The French concluded that Tuareg rebellions were largely the result of reform policies that undermined the traditional chiefs. The colonial authorities wished to create a protectorate operating, ideally, through single chieftains who ruled under French sovereignty, but were autonomous within their territories. Thus French rule, relying on the loyalty of the Tuareg noble caste, did not improve the status of the slave class.

===Post-colonial era===

When African countries achieved widespread independence in the 1960s, the traditional Tuareg territory was divided among a number of modern states: Niger, Mali, Algeria, Libya, and Burkina Faso. Political instability and competition for resources in the Sahel has since led to conflicts between the Tuareg and neighboring African groups. There have been tight restrictions placed on nomadic life because of high population growth. Desertification is exacerbated by over-exploitation of resources including firewood. This has pushed some Tuareg to experiment with farming; some have been forced to abandon herding and seek jobs in towns and cities.

Following the independence of Mali, a Tuareg uprising broke out in the Adrar N&#x27;Fughas mountains in the 1960s, joined by Tuareg groups from the Adrar des Iforas in northeastern Mali. The Malian Army suppressed the revolt, but resentment among the Tuareg fueled further uprisings.
This second (or third) uprising was in May 1990. In the aftermath of a clash between government soldiers and Tuareg outside a prison in Tchin-Tabaraden, Niger, Tuareg in both Mali and Niger claimed independence for their traditional homeland: Ténéré in Niger, including their capital Agadez, and the Azawad and Kidal regions of Mali.

Deadly clashes between Tuareg fighters, with leaders such as Mano Dayak, and the military of both countries followed, with deaths into the thousands. Negotiations initiated by France and Algeria led to peace agreements in January 1992 in Mali and in 1995 in Niger, both arranging for decentralization of national power and the integration of Tuareg resistance fighters into the countries&#x27; national armies.

Major fighting between the Tuareg resistance and government security forces ended after the 1995 and 1996 agreements. As of 2004, sporadic fighting continued in Niger between government forces and Tuareg rebels. In 2007, a new surge in violence occurred.

The development of Berberism in North Africa in the 1990s fostered a Tuareg ethnic revival.

Since 1998, three different flags have been designed to represent the Tuareg. In Niger, the Tuareg people remain socially and economically marginalized, remaining poor and unrepresented in Niger&#x27;s central government.

On 21 March 2021, IS-GS militants attacked several villages around Tillia, Niger, killing 141 people. The main victims of the massacres were the Tuaregs.

==Religion==
The Tuareg traditionally adhered to the Berber mythology. Archaeological excavations of prehistoric tombs in the Maghreb have yielded skeletal remains that were painted with ochre. Although this ritual practice was known to the Iberomaurusians, the custom seems instead to have been primarily derived from the ensuing Capsian culture. Megalithic tombs, such as the jedar sepulchres, were erected for religious and funerary practices. In 1926, one such tomb was discovered south of Casablanca. The monument was engraved with funerary inscriptions in the ancient Libyco-Berber writing script known as Tifinagh, which the Tuareg still use.

During the medieval period, the Tuareg adopted Islam after its arrival with the Umayyad Caliphate in the 7th century. In the 16th century, under the tutelage of El Maghili, the Tuareg embraced the Maliki school of Sunni Islam, which they now primarily follow. The Tuareg helped spread Islam further into the Western Sudan. While Islam is the religion of the contemporary Tuareg, historical documents suggest that they initially resisted Islamization efforts in their traditional strongholds. 

According to the anthropologist Susan Rasmussen, after the Tuareg had adopted the religion, they were reputedly lax in their prayers and observances of other Muslim precepts. Some of their ancient beliefs still exist today subtly within their culture and tradition, such as elements of pre-Islamic cosmology and rituals, particularly among Tuareg women, or the widespread &quot;cult of the dead&quot;, which is a form of ancestor veneration. For example, Tuareg religious ceremonies contain allusions to matrilineal spirits, as well as to fertility, menstruation, the earth and ancestresses. Norris (1976) suggests that this apparent syncretism may stem from the influence of Sufi Muslim preachers on the Tuareg.

The Tuaregs have been one of the influential ethnic groups in the spread of Islam and its legacy in North Africa and adjacent Sahel. Timbuktu, an important Islamic center famed for its ulama, was established by Imasheghen Tuareg at the start of the 12th century. It flourished under the protection and rule of a Tuareg confederation. However, modern scholars believe that there is insufficient evidence to pinpoint the exact time of origin and founders of Timbuktu, although it is archeologically clear that the city originated from local trade between the Middle Niger Delta, on the one hand, and between the pastoralists of the Sahara, long before the first hijra. Monroe asserts, based on archaeological evidence, that Timbuktu emerged from an urban-rural dynamic, that is, aiming to provide services to its immediate rural hinterland.

In 1449, a Tuareg ruling house founded the Tenere Sultanate of Aïr (Sultanate of Agadez) in the city of Agadez in the Aïr Mountains. 

18th century Tuareg Islamic scholars such as Jibril ibn &#x27;Umar later preached the value of revolutionary jihad. Inspired by these teachings, Ibn &#x27;Umar&#x27;s student Usman dan Fodio led the Sokoto jihads and established the Sokoto Caliphate.

==Society==
Tuareg society has traditionally featured clan membership, social status and caste hierarchies within each political confederation.

===Clans===

Clans have been a historic part of the Tuaregs. The 7th century invasion of North Africa from the Middle East triggered an extensive migration of Tuaregs such as the Lemta and the Zarawa, along with other fellow pastoral Berbers. Further invasions of Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arab tribes into Tuareg regions in the 11th century moved the Tuareg south into seven clans, which the oral tradition of Tuaregs claims are descendants of the same mother.

Each Tuareg clan (&quot;tawshet&quot;) is made up of family groups constituting a tribe, each led by its chief, the &quot;amghar&quot;. A series of &quot;tawsheten&quot; (plural of &quot;tawshet&quot;) may bond together under an &quot;Amenokal&quot;, forming a &quot;Kel&quot; clan confederation. Tuareg self-identification is related only to their specific &quot;Kel&quot;, which means &quot;those of&quot;. For example, &quot;Kel Dinnig&quot; (those of the east), &quot;Kel Ataram&quot; (those of the west).

The position of &quot;amghar&quot; is hereditary through a matrilineal principle; it is usual for the son of a sister of the incumbent chieftain to succeed to his position. The &quot;amenokal&quot; is elected in a ritual which differs between groups. The individual amghar who lead the clans making up the confederation usually have the deciding voice. The matrilineal inheritance and mythology among Tuareg clans, states Susan Rasmussen, is a cultural vestige from the pre-Islamic era of the Tuareg society.

According to Rasmussen, Tuareg society exhibits a blend of pre-Islamic and Islamic practices. Patrilineal Muslim values are believed to have been superimposed upon the Tuareg&#x27;s traditional matrilineal society. Other apparently newer customs include close-cousin endogamous marriages and polygyny in conformity with Islamic tenets. Polygyny, which has been witnessed among Tuareg chiefs and Islamic scholars, is in turn thought to have been contrary to the pre-Islamic monogamous tradition of the nomadic Tuareg.

===Social stratification===
Tuareg society has featured caste hierarchies within each clan and political confederation. These hierarchical systems have included nobles, clerics, craftsmen and unfree strata of people including widespread slavery.

====Nobility, vassals and clerics====

Traditionally, Tuareg society is hierarchical, with nobility and vassals. The linguist Karl-Gottfried Prasse (1995) indicates that the nobles constitute the highest caste. They are known in the Tuareg language as &quot;imušaɣ/imuhaɣ/imajăɣăn&quot; &quot;the proud and free&quot;. 

The nobles originally had a monopoly on carrying arms and owning camels, and were the warriors of the Tuareg regions. They may have achieved their social status by subjugating other Tuareg castes, keeping arms to defend their properties and vassals. They have collected tribute from their vassals. This warrior nobility has traditionally married within their caste, not to individuals in strata below their own. 

A collection of tribes, each led by a noble, forms a confederation whose chieftain, the &quot;amănokal&quot;, is elected from among the nobles by the tribal chiefs. The chieftain is the overlord during times of war, and receives tribute and taxes from tribes as a sign of their submission to his authority.

The vassal-herdsmen are the second free stratum within Tuareg society, occupying a position just below that of the nobles. They are known as &quot;ímɣad&quot; (&quot;Imghad&quot;, singular &quot;Amghid&quot;) in the Tuareg language. Although the vassals were free, they did not own camels but instead kept donkeys and herds of goats, sheep and oxen. They pastured and tended their own herds as well those owned by the nobles of the confederation. The vassal strata have traditionally paid an annual &quot;tiwse&quot;, or tribute to the nobles as a part of their status obligations, and hosted any noble who was traveling through their territory. 

In the late Medieval era, states Prasse, the previously existing weapon monopoly of the nobility broke down after regional wars took a heavy toll on the noble warrior strata, and thereafter the vassals carried weapons as well and were recruited as warriors. After the start of the French colonial rule, which deprived the nobles of their powers over war and taxation, the Tuaregs belonging to the noble strata disdained tending cattle and tilling the land, seeking instead soldiering or intellectual work.

A semi-noble stratum of the Tuareg people has been the endogamous religious clerics, the &quot;marabouts&quot; (Tuareg: &quot;Ineslemen&quot;, a loan word that means Muslim in Arabic). After the adoption of Islam, they became integral to the Tuareg social structure. According to Norris (1976), this stratum of Muslim clerics has been a sacerdotal caste, which propagated Islam in North Africa and the Sahel between the 7th and 17th centuries. Adherence to the faith was initially centered around this caste, but later spread to the wider Tuareg community. The marabouts have traditionally been the judges (&quot;qadi&quot;) and religious leaders (&quot;imam&quot;) of a Tuareg community.
====Castes====

According to anthropologist Jeffrey Heath, Tuareg artisans belong to separate endogamous castes known as the &quot;Inhăḍăn&quot; (&quot;Inadan&quot;). These have included blacksmith, jeweler, wood worker and leather artisan castes. They produced and repaired the saddles, tools, household items and other items for the Tuareg community. In Niger and Mali, where the largest Tuareg populations are found, the artisan castes were attached as clients to a family of nobles or vassals, carried messages over distances for their patron family, and traditionally sacrificed animals during Islamic festivals.

These social strata, like caste systems found in many parts of West Africa, included singers, musicians and story tellers of the Tuareg, who kept their oral traditions. They are called &quot;Agguta&quot; by Tuareg, have been called upon to sing during ceremonies such as weddings or funerals. The origins of the artisanal castes are unclear. One theory posits a Jewish derivation, a proposal that Prasse calls &quot;a much vexed question&quot;. Their association with fire, iron and precious metals and their reputation for being cunning tradesmen has led others to treat them with a mix of admiration and distrust.

According to Rasmussen, the Tuareg castes are not only hierarchical, as each caste differs in mutual perception, food and eating behaviors. For example, she relates an explanation by a smith on why there is endogamy among Tuareg castes in Niger. The smith explained, &quot;nobles are like rice, smiths are like millet, slaves are like corn&quot;.

The people who farm oases in some Tuareg-dominated areas form a distinct group known as &quot;izeggaghan&quot; (or &quot;hartani&quot; in Arabic). Their origins are unclear but they often speak both Tuareg dialects and Arabic, though a few communities are Songhay speakers. Traditionally, these local peasants were subservient to the warrior nobles who owned the oasis and the land. The peasants tilled these fields, whose output they gave to the nobles after keeping a fifth part of the produce. Their Tuareg patrons were usually responsible for supplying agricultural tools, seed and clothing. The peasants&#x27; origins are also unclear. One theory postulates that they are descendants of ancient people who lived in the Sahara before they were dominated by invading groups. In contemporary times, these peasant strata have blended in with freed slaves and farm arable lands together.

====Slaves====

The Tuareg confederations acquired slaves, often of Nilotic origin, as well as tribute-paying states in raids on surrounding communities. They also took captives as war booty or purchased slaves in markets. The slaves or servile communities are locally called &quot;Ikelan&quot; (or &quot;Iklan&quot;, &quot;Eklan&quot;), and slavery is inherited, with the descendants of the slaves known as &quot;irewelen&quot;.

They often live in communities separate from other castes. The Ikelan&#x27;s Nilotic extraction is denoted via the Ahaggar Berber word &quot;Ibenheren&quot; (sing. &quot;Ébenher&quot;).

The word &quot;ikelan&quot; is the plural form of &quot;slave&quot;, an allusion to most of the slaves. In post-colonial literature, the alternate terms for &quot;Ikelan&quot; include &quot;Bellah-iklan&quot; or just &quot;Bellah&quot;, derived from a Songhay word.

According to historian Priscilla Starratt (1981), the Tuareg evolved a system of slavery that was highly differentiated. They established strata among their slaves, which determined rules as to the slave&#x27;s expected behavior, marriageability, inheritance rights if any, and occupation. The &quot;Ikelan&quot; later became a bonded caste within Tuareg society, and they now speak the same Tamasheq language as Tuareg nobles and share many customs. According to Heath, the &quot;Bella&quot; in Tuareg society were the slave caste whose occupation was rearing and herding livestock such as sheep and goats.

French colonial governments stopped the acquisition of new slaves and slave trading in markets, but they did not remove or free domestic slaves from the Tuareg owners who had acquired them before French rule. In Tuareg society, like many others in West Africa, slave status was inherited, and the upper strata used slave children for domestic work, at camps and as dowry gifts to newlyweds.
According to Bernus (1972), Brusberg (1985) and Mortimore (1972), French colonial interests in the Tuareg region were primarily economic, and they had no intention of ending the slave-owning institution. Historian Martin A. Klein (1998) says that although French colonial rule indeed did not end domestic slavery in Tuareg society, the French reportedly attempted to impress upon the nobles the equality of the Imrad and Bella and to encourage the slaves to claim their rights. 

He suggests that there was a large scale attempt by French West African authorities to liberate slaves and other bonded castes in Tuareg areas following the 1914–1916 Firouan revolt. Despite this, French officials following the Second World War reported that there were some 50,000 &quot;Bella&quot; under direct control of Tuareg masters in the Gao–Timbuktu area of French Sudan alone. This was at least four decades after French declarations of mass freedom in other areas of the colony.

In 1946, a series of mass desertions of Tuareg slaves and bonded communities began in Nioro and later in Ménaka, quickly spreading along the Niger River valley. In the first decade of the 20th century, French administrators in southern Tuareg areas of the French Sudan estimated that &quot;free&quot; to &quot;servile&quot; groups within Tuareg society existed at ratios of 1 to 8 or 9. At the same time, the servile &quot;rimaibe&quot; population of the Masina Fulbe, roughly equivalent to the &quot;Bella&quot;, constituted between 70% and 80% of the Fulbe population, while servile Songhay groups around Gao made up some 2/3 to 3/4 of the total Songhay population. Klein concludes that approximately 50% of the population of French Sudan at the beginning of the 20th century was in some servile or slave relationship.

While post-independence states have sought to outlaw slavery, results have been mixed. Certain Tuareg communities still uphold the institution. Traditional caste relationships have continued in many places, including slaveholding. In Niger, where the practice of slavery was outlawed in 2003, according to ABC News, almost 8% of the population are still enslaved. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that many slaves held by the Tuareg in Mali were liberated during 2013–14 when French troops intervened on behalf of the Malian government against Islamic radicals.

====Chronology====

Tuareg social stratification into noble, clerical and artisanal castes likely emerged after the 10th century, as a corollary of the rising slavery system. Similar caste institutions are found in other communities in Africa. According to anthropologist Tal Tamari, linguistic evidence suggests that the Tuareg blacksmith and bard endogamous castes evolved under foreign contact with Sudanic peoples, since the Tuareg terms for &quot;blacksmith&quot; and &quot;bard&quot; are of non-Berber origin. The designation for the endogamous blacksmiths among the southern Tuareg is &quot;gargassa&quot;, a cognate of the Songhay &quot;garaasa&quot; and Fulani &quot;garkasaa6e&quot;, whereas it is &quot;enaden&quot; among the northern Tuareg, meaning &quot;the other&quot;.

Archaeological work by Rod McIntosh and Susan Keech McIntosh indicates that long-distance trade and specialized economies existed in the Western Sudan at an early date. During the 9th and 10th centuries, Berbers and Arabs built upon these pre-existing trade routes and quickly developed trans-Saharan and sub-Saharan transport networks. Successive local Muslim kingdoms developed increasing sophistication in their martial capacity, slave raiding, holding and trading systems. Among these Islamic states were the Ghana Empire (11th century), the Mali Empire (13th and 14th centuries), and the Songhay Empire (16th century). Slavery created a template for servile relationships, which developed into more complex castes and social stratification.

==Culture==
Tuareg culture is largely matrilineal. Other distinctive aspects of Tuareg culture include clothing, food, language, religion, arts, astronomy, nomadic architecture, traditional weapons, music, films, games, and economic activities.

===Clothing=== 
In Tuareg society women do not traditionally wear the face veil, whereas men do. The most famous Tuareg symbol is the &quot;tagelmust&quot; (also called éghéwed and, in Arabic, &quot;litham&quot;), sometimes referred to as a cheche (pronounced &quot;shesh&quot;), a combined turban and veil, often indigo-blue colored. The men&#x27;s facial covering originates from the belief that such action wards off evil spirits. It may have related instrumentally from the need for protection from the harsh desert sands as well. 

It is a firmly established tradition, as is the wearing of amulets containing sacred objects and, recently, verses from the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;. Taking on the veil is associated with the rite of passage to manhood. Men begin wearing a veil when they reach maturity. The veil usually conceals their face, excluding their eyes and the top of the nose.

Names for traditional clothing include:
* &quot;tagelmust&quot;: turban – men
* &quot;bukar&quot;: black cotton turban – men
* &quot;tasuwart&quot;: women&#x27;s veil
* &quot;takatkat&quot;: shirt – women and men
* &quot;takarbast&quot;: short shirt – women and men
* &quot;akarbey&quot;: pants worn by men
* &quot;afetek&quot;: loose shirt worn by women
* &quot;afer&quot;: women&#x27;s pagne
* &quot;tari&quot;: large black pagne for winter season
* &quot;bernuz&quot;: long woolen cloth for winter
* &quot;akhebay&quot;: loose bright green or blue cloth for women
* &quot;ighateman&quot;: shoes
* &quot;iragazan&quot;: red leather sandals
* &quot;ibuzagan&quot;: leather shoes
The traditional indigo turban is still preferred for celebrations, and generally Tuareg wear clothing and turbans in a variety of colors.

===Food===
Tagella is a flatbread made from wheat flour and cooked on a charcoal fire; the flat disk-shaped bread is buried under the hot sand. The bread is broken into small pieces and eaten with a meat sauce. Millet porridge called &quot;a cink&quot; or &quot;a liwa&quot; is a staple much like ugali and fufu. Millet is boiled with water to make a pap and eaten with milk or a heavy sauce. Common dairy foods are goat and camel milk, called &quot;akh&quot;, as well as a cheese, &quot;ta komart&quot;, and &quot;tona&quot;, a thick yogurt, made from them. Eghajira is a beverage drunk with a ladle, made by pounding millet, goat cheese, dates, milk, and sugar, served at festivals.

Just like in Morocco, the local popular tea, called &quot;atay&quot; or &quot;ashay&quot;, is made from gunpowder green tea with much sugar added. After steeping, it is poured three times in and out of the teapot over the tea, mint leaves and sugar and served by pouring from a height of over a foot into small tea glasses with a froth on top.

===Language===

The Tuareg natively speak the Tuareg languages. A dialect cluster, it belongs to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family. Tuareg is known as &quot;Tamasheq&quot; by western Tuareg in Mali, as &quot;Tamahaq&quot; among Algerian and Libyan Tuareg, and as &quot;Tamajeq&quot; in the Azawagh and Aïr regions of Niger.
French missionary Charles de Foucauld compiled perhaps the earliest dictionary of the Tuareg language.
The Tuaregs compose a great deal of poetry, often elegiac, epigrammatic, and amatory. Charles de Foucauld, and other ethnographers have preserved thousands of these poems, many of which Foucauld translated into French.

===Arts===

As in other rural Berber traditions, jewellery made of silver, coloured glass or iron is a special artform of the Tuareg people. While in other Berber cultures in the Maghreb jewelry is mainly worn by women, Tuareg men also wear necklaces, amulets and rings.

These traditional handicrafts are made by the &quot;inadan wan-tizol&quot; (makers of weapons and jewelry). Among their products are tanaghilt or zakkat (the &#x27;Agadez Cross&#x27; or &#x27;Croix d&#x27;Agadez&#x27;); the Tuareg sword (takoba), gold and silver necklaces called &#x27;takaza&#x27; as well as earrings called &#x27;tizabaten&#x27;. Pilgrimage boxes with intricate iron and brass decorations are used to carry items. Tahatint are made of goat skin. Other such artifacts include metalwork for saddle decoration, called &quot;trik&quot;.

Most forms of the Agadez Cross are worn as pendants with varied shapes that either resemble a cross or have the shape of a plate or shield. Historically, the oldest known specimens were made of stone or copper, but subsequently Tuareg blacksmiths also used iron and silver, in the lost-wax casting technique. According to the article &quot;The cross of Agadez&quot; by Seligman and Loughran (2006), this piece has become a national and African symbol for Tuareg culture and political rights. Today, these pieces of jewellery are often made for tourists or as items of ethnic-style fashion for customers in other countries, with certain modern changes.

===Astronomy===

The clear desert skies allowed the Tuareg to be keen observers. Tuareg celestial objects include:
* Azzag Willi (Venus), which indicates the time for milking the goats
* Shet Ahad (Pleiades), the seven sisters of the night
* Amanar (Orion), the warrior of the desert
* Talemt (Ursa Major), the she-camel wakes up
* Awara (Ursa Minor), the baby camel goes to sleep

===Nomadic architecture===

While living quarters are progressively changing to adapt to a more sedentary lifestyle, Tuareg groups are well known for their nomadic architecture (tents). There are several documented styles, some covered with animal skin, some with mats. The style tends to vary by location or subgroup. The tent is traditionally constructed for the first time during the marriage ceremony and is considered an extension of the union, to the extent that the phrase &quot;making a tent&quot; is a metaphor for becoming married. 

Because the tent is considered to be under the ownership of a married woman, sedentary dwellings generally belong to men, reflecting a patriarchal shift in power dynamics. Current documentation suggests a negotiation of common practice in which a woman&#x27;s tent is set up in the courtyard of her husband&#x27;s house. It has been suggested that the traditional tent construction and arrangement of living space within it represent a microcosm of the greater world as an aide in the organization of lived experiences so much so that movement away from the tent can cause changes in character for both men and women as its stabilizing force becomes faint.

An old legend says the Tuareg once lived in grottoes, &quot;akazam&quot;, and they lived in foliage beds on the top acacia trees, &quot;tasagesaget&quot;. Other kinds of traditional housing include: &quot;ahaket&quot; (Tuareg goatskin red tent), &quot;tafala&quot; (a shade made of millet sticks), &quot;akarban&quot; also called &quot;takabart&quot; (temporary hut for winter), &quot;ategham&quot; (summer hut), &quot;taghazamt&quot; (adobe house for long stay), and &quot;ahaket&quot; (a dome-shaped house made of mats for the dry season and square shaped roof with holes to prevent hot air).

===Traditional weapons===

* &quot;takoba&quot;: 1 meter long straight sword
* &quot;sheru&quot;: long dagger
* &quot;telek&quot;: short dagger kept in a sheath attached to the left forearm.
* &quot;allagh&quot;: 2 meter long lance
* &quot;tagheda&quot;: small and sharp assegai
* &quot;taganze&quot;: leather covered-wooden bow
* &quot;amur&quot;: wooden arrow
* &quot;taburek&quot;: wooden stick
* &quot;alakkud&quot; or &quot;abartak&quot;: riding crop
* &quot;agher&quot;: 1.50 meter high shield

In 2007, Stanford&#x27;s Cantor Arts Center opened an exhibition, &quot;Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara Nomads in a Modern World&quot;, the first such exhibit in the United States. It was curated by Tom Seligman, director of the center. He had first spent time with the Tuareg in 1971 when he traveled through the Sahara after serving in the Peace Corps. The exhibition included crafted and adorned functional objects such as camel saddles, tents, bags, swords, amulets, cushions, dresses, earrings, spoons and drums. The exhibition also was shown at the University of California, Los Angeles Fowler Museum in Angeles and the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C.

Throughout history, the Tuareg were renowned and respected warriors. Their decline as a military might came with the introduction of firearms, weapons which the Tuareg did not possess. The Tuareg warrior equipment consisted of a &quot;takoba&quot; (sword), &quot;allagh&quot; (lance), and &quot;aghar&quot; (shield) made of antelope hide.

===Music===

Traditional Tuareg music has two major components: the monochord violin &quot;anzad&quot; played often during night parties and a small &quot;tambour&quot; covered with goatskin called &quot;tende&quot;, performed during camel and horse races, and other festivities. Traditional songs called &quot;Asak&quot; and &quot;Tisiway&quot; (poems) are sung by women and men during feasts and social occasions. Another popular Tuareg musical genre is &quot;Takamba&quot;, characterized by its Afro percussions.

Vocal music
* &quot;tisiway&quot;: poems
* &quot;tasikisikit&quot;: songs performed by women, accompanied by tende (drum); the men, on camel-back, circle the women as they sing.
* &quot;asak&quot;: songs accompanied by anzad monocord violin.
* &quot;tahengemmit&quot;: slow songs sung by elder men
Children and youth music

* &quot;Bellulla&quot;: songs made by children playing with the lips
* &quot;Fadangama&quot;: small monocord instrument for children
* &quot;Odili&quot; flute: made from trunk of sorghum
* &quot;Gidga&quot; small: wooden instrument with irons sticks to make strident sounds

Dance
* &quot;Tagest&quot;: dance made while seated, moving the head, the hands and the shoulders
* &quot;Ewegh&quot;: strong dance performed by men, in couples and groups
* &quot;Agabas&quot;: dance for modern ishumar guitars: women and men in groups

In the 1980s rebel fighters founded Tinariwen, a Tuareg band that fuses electric guitars and indigenous musical styles. Especially in areas that were cut off during the Tuareg rebellion (e.g., Adrar des Iforas), they were practically the only music available, which helped them to regional success. They released their first CD in 2000, and toured in Europe and the United States in 2004. Tuareg guitar groups that followed in their path include Group Inerane and Group Bombino. The Niger-based band &quot;Etran Finatawa&quot; combines Tuareg and &quot;Wodaabe&quot; members, playing a combination of traditional instruments and electric guitars.

===Economy===
Tuareg are distinguished in their native language as the &quot;Imouhar&quot;, meaning the free people; the overlap of meaning has increased local cultural nationalism.
Many Tuareg today are either settled agriculturalists or nomadic cattle breeders, while others are blacksmiths or caravan leaders. The Tuareg are a pastoral people, having an economy based on livestock breeding, trading, and agriculture.

====Caravan trade====

Since prehistoric times, Tuareg peoples have been organising caravans for trading across the Sahara desert. The caravan in Niger from around Agadez to Fachi and Bilma is called &quot;Tarakaft&quot; or &quot;Taghlamt&quot; in Tamashek, and that in Mali from Timbuktu to Taoudenni, &quot;Azalay&quot;. These caravans used first oxen, horses and later camels as a means of transportation.

Salt mines or &quot;salines&quot; in the desert.
* Tin Garaban near Ghat in Azjar, Libya
* Amadghor in Ahaggar, Algeria
* Taoudenni in far northern Mali
* Tagidda N Tesemt in Azawagh, Niger
* Fachi in Ténéré desert, Niger
* Bilma in Kawar, eastern Niger
A contemporary variant is occurring in northern Niger, in a traditionally Tuareg territory that comprises most of the uranium-rich land of the country. The central government in Niamey has shown itself unwilling to cede control of the highly profitable mining to indigenous clans. The Tuareg are determined not to relinquish the prospect of substantial economic benefit. The French government has independently tried to defend a French firm, Areva, established in Niger for fifty years and now mining the massive uranium deposit.

Additional complaints against Areva are that it is: &quot;...plundering...the natural resources and [draining] the fossil deposits. It is undoubtedly an ecological catastrophe&quot;. These mines yield uranium ores, which are then processed to produce &quot;yellowcake&quot;, crucial to the nuclear power industry, as well as aspirational nuclear powers. In 2007, some Tuareg people in Niger allied themselves with the Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ), a rebel group operating in the north of the country. 

In 2004–2007, U.S. Special Forces teams trained Tuareg units of the Nigerien Army in the Sahel region as part of the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership. Some of these trainees are reported to have fought in the 2007 rebellion within the MNJ. The goal of these Tuareg appears to be economic and political control of ancestral lands, rather than operating from religious and political ideologies.

Despite the Sahara&#x27;s erratic and unpredictable rainfall patterns, the Tuareg have managed to survive in the hostile desert environment for centuries. Over recent years however, depletion of water by the uranium exploitation process combined with the effects of climate change are threatening their ability to subsist. Uranium mining has diminished and degraded Tuareg grazing lands. The mining industry produces radioactive waste that can contaminate crucial sources of ground water resulting in cancer, stillbirths, and genetic defects, and uses up huge quantities of water in a region where water is already scarce. 

This is exacerbated by the increased rate of desertification thought to be the result of global warming. Lack of water forces the Tuareg to compete with southern farming communities for scarce resources and this has led to tensions and clashes between these communities. The precise levels of environmental and social impact of the mining industry have proved difficult to monitor due to governmental obstruction.

==Genetics==
===Y-chromosome DNA===
Y-Dna haplogroups, passed on exclusively through the paternal line, were found at the following frequencies in Tuaregs:
E1b1b is the most common paternal haplogroup among the Tuareg. Most belong to its E1b1b1b (E-M81) subclade, which is colloquially referred to as the &quot;Berber marker&quot; due to its prevalence among Mozabite, Middle Atlas, Kabyle and other Berber groups. It reaches frequencies of up to 100 percent in some parts of the Maghreb, and is dominated by its sub-clade E-M183. M81 is thought to have originated in North Africa up to 14,000 years ago, but a single 2200-year-old branch M183-PF2546 dominates Northern and Eastern Berbers. Its parent haplogroup E1b1b is associated with Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations, and is thought to have arisen in the Horn of Africa.

Besides E1b1b, Pereira et al. (2011) and Ottoni et al. (2011) observed that certain Tuareg inhabiting Niger and Libya carry the E1b1a1-M2 haplogroup (see table above). This clade is today primarily found among Niger-Congo-speaking populations, which suggests that some Tuareg tribes in parts of Libya and Niger may have assimilated many persons of West African origin into their communities. To wit, around 50% of individuals among the Al Awaynat Tuareg in Libya are E1b1a carriers compared to only 11% of the adjacent Tahala Tuareg. 89% of the Tahala belong instead to the E1b1b-M81 Berber founding lineage.

===mtDNA===
According to mtDNA analysis by Ottoni et al. (2010) in a study of 47 individuals, the Tuareg inhabiting the Fezzan region in Libya predominantly carry the H1 haplogroup (61%). This is the highest global frequency found so far of the maternal clade. The haplogroup peaks among Berber populations. The remaining Libyan Tuareg mainly belong to two other West Eurasian mtDNA lineages, M1 and V. M1 is today most common among other Afro-Asiatic speakers inhabiting East Africa, and is believed to have arrived on the continent along with the U6 haplogroup from the Near East around 40,000 years ago. In 2009, based on 129 individuals, Libyan Tuareg were shown to have a maternal genetic pool with a &quot;European&quot; component similar to other Berbers, as well as a south Saharan contribution linked to Eastern Africa and Near Eastern populations.

Pereira et al. (2010) in a study of 90 unrelated individuals observed greater matrilineal heterogeneity among the Tuareg inhabiting more southerly areas in the Sahel. The Tuareg in the Gossi environs in Mali largely bear the H1 haplogroup (52%), with the M1 lineage (19%), and various Sub-Saharan L2 subclades (19%) next most common. Similarly, most of the Tuareg inhabiting Gorom-Gorom in Burkina Faso carry the H1 haplogroup (24%), followed by various L2 subclades (24%), the V lineage (21%), and haplogroup M1 (18%).

The Tuareg in the vicinity of Tanout in Maradi Region and westward to villages of Loube and Djibale in Tahoua Region in Niger are different from the other Tuareg populations in that a majority carry Sub-Saharan mtDNA lineages. In fact, the name for these mixed Tuareg-Haussa people is &quot;Djibalawaa&quot; named after the village of Djibale in Bouza Department, Tahoua Region of Niger. This points to significant assimilation of local West African females into this community. The most common maternal haplogroups found among the Tanout Tuareg are various L2 subclades (39%), followed by L3 (26%), various L1 sublineages (13%), V (10%), H1 (3%), M1 (3%), U3a (3%), and L0a1a (3%).

=== Autosomal DNA ===
Based on classical genetic markers, according to Cavalli-Sforza LL, Menozzi P, Piazza A. (1994), the Tuareg have genetic affinities with the Beja people, a minority ethnic group inhabiting parts of Sudan, Egypt, and Eritrea. The inferred ethnogenesis of the Tuareg people happened within a time period of 9,000 to 3,000 years ago, and most likely took place somewhere in Northern Africa.

A 2017 study by Arauna et al. which analyzed existing genetic data obtained from Northern African populations, such as Berbers, described them as a mosaic of local Northern African (Taforalt), Middle Eastern, European (Early European Farmers), and Sub-Saharan African-related ancestries.

<text>The Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition of 1926 was a world&#x27;s fair in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its purpose was to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the 50th anniversary of the 1876 Centennial Exposition.

==History==
===Planning===

In 1916, the idea for a Sesquicentennial Exposition stemmed from the mind of John Wanamaker, who was the only living member of the Centennial Exposition&#x27;s Finance Committee. At the time Philadelphia was a booming city, in terms of size and opportunity; however, it suffered from corruption on political and financial fronts. Wanamaker was well aware of the city&#x27;s corruption, and believed a fair could redeem Philadelphia&#x27;s reputation. He believed by hosting another world&#x27;s fair, the restoration of the city&#x27;s integrity, patriotism, and industry would emerge. By the end of August 1916, Wanamaker received the support of Howard French, the president of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. In October, plans were underway, and French assigned a committee responsible for planning the &quot;Great International Exposition of Philadelphia in 1926&quot;.  The Fairmount Parkway, which was under construction, would be the official site of the exposition.  In 1917 the United States found itself involved in World War I, which caused the planning for the Sesquicentennial Exposition to be placed on hold.

After World War I, Philadelphia suffered because of losses in the war, the spread of Spanish Influenza, and the hardships of Prohibition.  These circumstances combined made the city&#x27;s atmosphere bleak, even with the election of the new mayor J. Hampton Moore. Through these hardships, Wanamaker&#x27;s hope and vision for a celebration of Philadelphia continued. Wanamaker took advantage of an interview on July 11, 1919, by using the opportunity to discuss his ideas for a 1926 world&#x27;s fair.  From this interview, he received the support of other notable Philadelphians as well as the Franklin Institute and Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, who encouraged Mayor Moore to participate in immediate planning.  By November 1920, Moore hosted an event to discuss and develop plans for the Sesquicentennial Exposition, resulting in the establishment of the Committee of 100. The committee&#x27;s first meeting was held on January 24, 1921, renaming itself the Sesqui-Centennial Exhibition Association (SCEA). Mayor Moore had been elected as the SCEA&#x27;s president, while Wanamaker was appointed honorary chairman to its board.

The honor of hosting this celebration was awarded to Philadelphia in 1921. Initial grand plans were scaled down tremendously by the time the fair opened. The original director of the exposition, Colonel David C. Collier, resigned in protest over these budget cuts. His replacement, Captain Asher C. Baker, retired due to illness days before the festival opened, leaving things in the hands of E. L. Austin. Baker died less than two weeks later.

===Opening===

The fair opened on May 31, 1926, and ran through November on grounds bounded by 10th Street, Packer Avenue, 23rd Street, and the U.S. Navy Yard (Terminal Avenue) in South Philadelphia. Originally known as League Island Park, these grounds are now occupied by FDR Park, Marconi Plaza, Packer Park Residential Neighborhood, the three stadiums of Philadelphia&#x27;s massive South Philadelphia Sports Complex: Wells Fargo Center, Lincoln Financial Field, and Citizens Bank Park, and the Philadelphia Eagles training complex which now occupy that portion of the grounds which from 1933 to 1993 were the site of Philadelphia Naval Hospital that was demolished 2001.

The senior draftsman for the design of the exposition buildings was a young Louis Kahn, later a world-renowned architect, then working under City Architect John Molitor. Sculptor Charles Tefft was chosen as the director of sculpture for the fair while noted Philadelphia sculptor and artist Albert Laessle created the fair&#x27;s Medals of Award.

==Highlights==

Organizers constructed an replica of the Exposition&#x27;s symbol, the Liberty Bell, covered in 26,000 light bulbs, at the gateway to the festival. Sesqui-Centennial Stadium (later known as Philadelphia Municipal Stadium and, after 1964, John F. Kennedy Stadium) was built in conjunction with the fair. The stadium had been a significant aspect of the fair, due to several events being held there. These events include religious ceremonies, the patriotic pageant known as &quot;Freedom,&quot; and numerous sporting events. One of the most infamous events was the September 23rd championship boxing match between Gene Tunney and Jack Dempsey, which drew a crowd of 125,000 people standing in the rain to witness the occasion. Also on display at the exposition was the Curtis Organ, still one of the largest pipe organs in the world. In 1926 the first bridge (later renamed Benjamin Franklin Bridge) spanning the Delaware River between center city Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey, was built in anticipation of the attending crowds.

Key speakers at the opening ceremonies were Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg, Secretary of Commerce and future President Herbert Hoover, and Philadelphia Mayor W. Freeland Kendrick.
At the center of the exposition along the main thoroughfare on a segment of south Broad Street known as the Southern Boulevard Parkway was the Forum of Founders consisting of the Court of Honor, the Liberal Arts and Agriculture Buildings, a group of sculptures and the Stairway of Nations facing on the opposing side the spectacular Tower of Light. Another highlight for fair goers, revolved around the recreation of Philadelphia&#x27;s High Street during the city&#x27;s colonial period. This area consisted of over twenty buildings, along with guides dressed in period clothing to interact with people.

The Exposition also included an amusement area, located within League Island Park. The area was designated as &quot;Treasure Island.&quot; It occupied over five acres and was referred to as a children&#x27;s paradise. A variety of amusements and entertainment were available. Included were a replica of the Canadian Rockies, a miniature railroad, mountain slide, Robinson Crusoe&#x27;s Beach, a pirate&#x27;s lair, boat rides and Noah&#x27;s Ark complete with animals. The exposition had a number of roller coasters. These included The Cyclone, a prototype of Harry Traver&#x27;s Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters and an installation of his Jazz Railway model of coaster.

Naval Air Facility Mustin Field was dedicated at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on September 17, 1926, in honor of Captain Henry C. Mustin, Navy Air Pilot No.3, and Naval Aviator No. 11, who recorded the first catapult launch from a moving vessel on November 5, 1915, when he flew off of USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; in a Curtiss Model AB-2. &quot;It was a major event that drew 1,500 spectators, among them Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Douglas Robinson, Brig. Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rear Adm. William Moffett, and Philadelphia Mayor W. Freeland Kendrick, who had been a childhood friend of Capt. Mustin. The dedication took place toward the end of the six-month Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exposition, whose president was John Wanamaker. Thirty foreign nations attended the Sesqui, and all the planes from the exhibition flew in formation with aircraft of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps to honor Mustin.&quot;

Among the foreign nations that attended the Sesquicentennial was China, represented by H. H. Kung.

==Reception and legacy==
From its opening day on May 31, the exposition already faced challenges to its success. The fair opened with a heavy downpour of rain, causing many fair goers to leave. However, one man, Jacob J. Henderson had been proud to be the first person to enter the fairgrounds at the 9:00 A.M. opening. He stated that he had been to the Centennial with his parents, and did not want to miss opening day of the Sesqui. Within the first hour, it is believed that less than 250 entered the gates of the fairgrounds. The fair drew a much smaller crowd than anticipated (about 10 million people). &quot;Variety&quot; dubbed it &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Flop&quot; with a loss of $20 million by August 1926. The exposition ended up unable to cover its debts and was placed into receivership in 1927, at which point its assets were sold at auction.

Benito Mussolini commemorated the Sesquicentennial by giving a $800,000 replica of Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of Sea Horses&quot; to the city, which arrived after the fair closed. Installed in Fairmount Park, it was neglected for many years before being restored in 2013. A commemorative stamp, showing the Liberty Bell (Scott catalogue number 627) was printed, and two early United States commemorative coins were minted. Known as the United States Sesquicentennial coinage, they included a silver half dollar and a gold Quarter eagle. The fifty cent coin shows the heads of George Washington and Calvin Coolidge on the obverse, and the Liberty Bell on the reverse. The $2 1/2 coin has on the obverse Liberty holding a torch and the Declaration of Independence while standing on a globe; the reverse depicts Independence Hall. The stamp was issued in large numbers and is very inexpensive. The coins sold only moderately well, although both remain more common than many commemorative issues of this period.

===Possible 2026 revival===
A group called USA250 is looking to hold another world&#x27;s fair-type exhibition in Philadelphia in 2026 to commemorate America&#x27;s 250th birthday. In April 2015, the Philadelphia City Council unanimously passed a resolution to study the matter.

<text>The Centennial International Exhibition, officially the International Exhibition of Arts, Manufactures, and Products of the Soil and Mine, was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from May 10 to November 10, 1876. It was the first official world&#x27;s fair to be held in the United States and coincided with the centennial anniversary of the Declaration of Independence&#x27;s adoption in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776.

It was held in Fairmount Park along the Schuylkill River on fairgrounds designed by Herman J. Schwarzmann. Nearly 10 million visitors attended the exposition, and 37 countries participated in it.

== Precursor ==

The Great Central Fair on Logan Square in Philadelphia, in 1864, also known as the Great Sanitary Fair, was one of the many United States Sanitary Commission&#x27;s Sanitary Fairs held during the American Civil War.

The fairs provided a creative and communal means for ordinary citizens to promote the welfare of Union Army soldiers and dedicate themselves to the survival of the nation, and the Great Central Fair bolstered Philadelphia&#x27;s role as a vital center in the Union war effort. It anticipated the combination of public, private, and commercial investments that were necessary to mount the Centennial Exposition. Both had a similar neo-Gothic appearance, including the waving flags, a huge central hall, the &quot;curiosities&quot; and relics, handmade and industrial exhibits, and also a visit from the U.S. president and his family.

== Planning==
The idea of the Centennial Exposition is credited to John L. Campbell, a professor of mathematics, natural philosophy, and astronomy at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana. In December 1866, Campbell suggested to Philadelphia Mayor Morton McMichael that the United States Centennial be celebrated with an exposition in Philadelphia. Naysayers argued that the project would not be able to find funding, other nations might not attend, and domestic exhibits might compare poorly to foreign ones.

The Franklin Institute became an early supporter of the exposition and asked the Philadelphia City Council for use of Fairmount Park. With reference to the numerous events of national importance that were held in the past and related to the city of Philadelphia, the City Council resolved in January 1870 to hold the Centennial Exposition in the city in 1876.

The Philadelphia City Council and the Pennsylvania General Assembly created a committee to study the project and seek support of the U.S. Congress. Congressman William D. Kelley spoke for the city and state, and Daniel Johnson Morrell introduced a bill to create a United States Centennial Commission. The bill, which passed on March 3, 1871, provided that the U.S. government would not be liable for any expenses.

The United States Centennial Commission organized on March 3, 1872, with Joseph R. Hawley of Connecticut as president. The Centennial Commission&#x27;s commissioners included one representative from each state and territory in the United States. On June 1, 1872, Congress created a Centennial Board of Finance to help raise money. The board&#x27;s president was John Welsh, brother of philanthropist William Welsh, who had raised funds for the Great Sanitary Fair in 1864. The board was authorized to sell up to $10 million in stock via $10 shares. The board sold $1,784,320 ($ in ) worth of shares by February 22, 1873. Philadelphia contributed $1.5 million and Pennsylvania gave $1 million. On February 11, 1876, Congress appropriated $1.5 million in a loan.

The board initially thought it was a subsidy. (And in fact, after the exposition ended, the federal government sued to have the money returned, and the United States Supreme Court ultimately forced repayment.) John Welsh therefore enlisted help from the women of Philadelphia who had helped him in the Great Sanitary Fair. A Women&#x27;s Centennial Executive Committee was formed with Elizabeth Duane Gillespie, a great-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin, as president. In its first few months, the group raised $40,000. When the group learned the planning commission was not doing much to display the work of women, it raised an additional $30,000 for a women&#x27;s exhibition building.

In 1873, the Centennial Commission named Alfred T. Goshorn as the director general of the Exposition. The Fairmount Park Commission set aside of West Fairmount Park for the exposition, which was dedicated on July 4, 1873, by Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson. The Commission decided to classify the exhibits into seven departments: agriculture, art, education and science, horticulture, machinery, manufactures, and mining and metallurgy. Newspaper publisher John W. Forney agreed to head and pay for a Philadelphia commission sent to Europe to invite nations to exhibit at the exposition. Despite fears of a European boycott and high American tariffs making foreign goods not worthwhile, no European country declined the invitation.

To accommodate out-of-town visitors, temporary hotels were constructed near the exposition&#x27;s grounds. A Centennial Lodging-House Agency made a list of rooms in hotels, boarding houses, and private homes and then sold tickets for the available rooms in cities promoting the Centennial or on trains heading for Philadelphia. Philadelphia streetcars increased service, and the Pennsylvania Railroad ran special trains from Philadelphia&#x27;s Market Street, New York City, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad ran special trains from the Center City part of Philadelphia. A small hospital was built on the exposition&#x27;s grounds by the Centennial&#x27;s Medical Bureau, but despite a heat wave during the summer, no mass health crises occurred.

Philadelphia passed an ordinance that authorized Mayor William S. Stokley to appoint 500 men as Centennial Guards for the exposition. Among soldiers and local men hired by the city was Frank Geyer, best known for investigating one of America&#x27;s first serial killers, H. H. Holmes. Centennial Guards policed exhibits, kept the peace, reunited lost children, and received, recorded, and when possible, returned lost items, the most unusual of which were front hair pieces and false teeth.

Guards were required to live onsite and were housed at six police stations strategically located throughout the Exposition. A magistrate&#x27;s office and courtroom were located at the only two-story police station located on the grounds and was used to conduct prisoner hearings. Officers slept in cramped quarters, which fostered health issues. Eight guards died while working the Exposition, six from typhoid fever, one from smallpox, and one from organic disease of the heart.

The Centennial National Bank was chartered on January 19, 1876, to be the &quot;financial agent of the board at the Centennial Exhibition, receiving and accounting for daily receipts, changing foreign moneys into current funds, etc.,&quot; according to an article three days later in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. Its main branch, designed by Frank Furness, was opened that April on the southeast corner of Market Street and 32nd Street. A branch office operated during the exposition on the fairgrounds. The Centennial Commission ran out of funds for printing and other expenses.

Philadelphia city officials appropriated $50,000 to make up for the shortfall.

==Herman J. Schwarzmann==
Herman J. Schwarzmann, an engineer for the Fairmount Park Commission, was appointed the main designer of the exposition. In 1869, Schwarzmann began working for the Fairmount Park Commission, which administered the site of the 1876 Centennial Exposition. It is one of the great urban parks of the United States; its importance in landscape history was surpassed only by Central Park. Schwarzmann was the chief architect for the Centennial Exposition, designing Memorial Hall, Horticultural Hall, other small buildings, and the landscaping around them. His work for the Centennial Exposition was informed by the Vienna International Exposition in 1873, which Schwarzmann visited to study the buildings and the grounds layout. The Vienna International Exposition in 1873 was marred by disastrous logistic planning and was taken as a cautionary example.

At the Vienna Exposition, there was no convenient way for visitors to reach the fairgrounds, and exorbitant rates were charged by carriage drivers. Drawing lessons from this failure, the Philadelphia exposition was ready for its visitors, with direct railroad connections to service passenger trains every 30 minutes, trolley lines, street cars, carriage routes, and even docking facilities on the river.

==Structures==

More than 200 buildings were constructed within the exposition&#x27;s grounds, which were surrounded by a fence nearly three miles long. There were five main buildings in the exposition. They were the Main Exhibition Building, Memorial Hall, Machinery Hall, Agricultural Hall, and Horticultural Hall. Apart from these buildings, there were separate buildings for state, federal, foreign, corporate, and public comfort buildings. This strategy of numerous buildings in one exposition set it apart from the previous fairs around the world that had relied exclusively on having one or a few large buildings.

The Centennial Commission sponsored a design competition for the principal buildings, conducted in two rounds; winners of the first round had to have details such as construction cost and time prepared for the runoff on September 20, 1873. After the ten design winners were chosen, it was determined that none of them allowed enough time for construction and limited finances.

The architecture of the exposition mainly consisted of two types of building, traditional masonry monuments and buildings with a structural framework of iron and steel.

=== Main Exhibition Building ===
The Centennial Commission turned to third-place winner&#x27;s architect Henry Pettit and engineer Joseph M. Wilson for design and construction of the Main Exhibition Building. A temporary structure, the Main Building was the largest building in the world by area, enclosing . It measured in width and in length.

It was constructed using prefabricated parts, with a wood and iron frame resting on a substructure of 672 stone piers. Wrought iron roof trusses were supported by the columns of the superstructure.

The building took eighteen months to complete and cost $1,580,000. The building was surrounded by portals on all four sides. The east entrance of the building was used as an access way for carriages, and the south entrance of the building served as a primary entrance to the building for streetcars. The north side related the building to the Art Gallery and the west side served as a passageway to the Machinery and Agricultural Halls.

In the Main Exhibition Building, columns were placed at a uniform distance of . The entire structure consisted of 672 columns, the shortest column in length and the longest in length. The construction included red and black brick-laid design with stained glass or painted glass decorations. The Interior walls were whitewashed, and woodwork was decorated with shades of green, crimson, blue, and gold. The flooring of the building was made of wooden planks that rested directly on the ground without any air space underneath them.

The orientation of the building was east–west in direction, making it well lit, and glass was used between the frames to let in light. Skylights were set over the central aisles of the structure. The corridors of the building were separated by fountains that were attractive and also provided cooling.

The structure of the building featured a central avenue with a series of parallel sheds that were wide, long, and high. It was the longest nave ever introduced into an exhibition building up to that time. On both sides of the nave were avenues in width and in length. Aisles wide were located between the nave and the side avenues, and smaller aisles in width were on the outer sides of the building.

The exterior of the building featured four towers, each high, at each of the building&#x27;s corners. These towers had small balconies at different heights that served as observation galleries.

Within the building, exhibits were arranged in a grid, in a dual arrangement of type and national origin. Exhibits from the United States were placed in the center of the building, and foreign exhibits were arranged around the center, based on the nation&#x27;s distance from the United States. Exhibits inside the Main Exhibition Building dealt with mining, metallurgy, manufacturing, education, and science. Offices for foreign commissioners were placed in proximity to the products exhibited along in the aisles along the sides of the building. The walkways leading to the exit doors were ten feet wide.

After the Exposition, the structure was turned into a permanent building for the International Exhibition. During the auction held on December 1, 1876, it was bought for $250,000. It quickly ran into financial difficulties but remained open through 1879 and was finally demolished in 1881.

=== Agricultural Hall ===
The third-largest structure at the exposition was Agricultural Hall. Designed by James H. Windrim, Agricultural Hall was long and wide. Made of wood and glass, the building was designed to look like various barn structures pieced together. The building&#x27;s exhibits included products and machines used in agriculture and other related businesses.

=== Horticultural Hall ===

Situated high atop a hill presiding over Fountain Avenue, Horticultural Hall epitomized floral achievement, which attracted professional and amateur gardeners. Unlike the other main buildings, it was meant to be permanent. Horticultural Hall had an iron and glass frame on a brick and marble foundation and was long, wide, and tall. The building was designed in the Moorish style and intended as a tribute to the Crystal Palace of London&#x27;s Great Exhibition of 1851.

Inside, nurserymen, florists, and landscape architects exhibited a variety of tropical plants, garden equipment, and garden plans. In dramatic fashion, the exposition introduced the general public to the notion of landscape design, as exemplified the building itself and the grounds surrounding it. A long, sunken parterre leading to Horticultural Hall became the exposition&#x27;s iconic floral feature, reproduced on countless postcards and other memorabilia. This sunken garden enabled visitors on the raised walkways to see the patterns and shapes of the flowerbeds. After the Exposition, the building continued to be used for horticultural exhibits until it was severely damaged by Hurricane Hazel in 1954 and was subsequently demolished. As a replacement, the Fairmount Park Horticulture Center was built on the site in 1976 as part of the United States Bicentennial exposition.

=== Machinery Hall ===

Designed by Joseph M. Wilson and Henry Pettit, Machinery Hall was the second largest structure in the exposition and located west of the Main Exhibition Building. With a superstructure made of wood and glass resting on a foundation of massive masonry, it had a main hall painted light blue, long and wide, with a wing of by attached on the south side of the building. The length of the building was 18 times its height. With eight entrances, it occupied , had 1,900 exhibitors, and took six months to construct. The exhibits focused on machines and evolving industries. Machinery Hall was the show case for the state of the art industrial technology that was being produced at the time. The United States of America alone took up two-thirds of the exhibit space in the building.

One of the major attractions on display in the building was the Corliss Centennial Steam Engine that ran power to all the machinery in the building as well as other parts of the world&#x27;s fair. The 1,400 horsepower engine was tall, weighed 650 tons, and had of overhead line belts connecting to the machinery in the building. It symbolized the technology that was transforming the United States into an industrial powerhouse.

Amenities available to the visitors within the hall were rolling chairs, telegraph offices, and dinner for fifty cents. Machinery Hall had 8,000 operating machines and was filled with a wide assortment of hand tools, machine tools, material handling equipment, and the latest fastener technology.

Some of the sandstone that was used to build the hall was from Curwensville, Pennsylvania.

=== Memorial Hall ===
The Art Gallery building (now known as Memorial Hall) is the only large exhibit building still standing on the exposition site. Constructed of brick, glass, iron, and granite in the beaux-arts style, it was the largest art hall in the country when it opened, with a massive footprint and a dome atop a -high structure. The central domed area is surrounded by four pavilions on the corners, with open arcades to the east and west of the main entrance. It provided of wall surface for paintings and of floor space for sculptures. The exposition received so many art contributions that a separate annex was built to house them all. Another structure was built for the display of photography.

Memorial Hall was designed by Herman J. Schwarzmann, who basically adopted an art museum plan submitted by Nicholas Félix Escalier to the competition in 1867–69. Memorial Hall became the prototype, both from a stylistic and organizational standpoint, for other museums such as the Art Institute of Chicago (1892–1893), the Milwaukee Public Museum (1893–1897), the Brooklyn Museum (1893–1924), and the Detroit Institute of Art (1920–1927). Libraries such as the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the Free Library of Philadelphia also emulated its form. Finally, Memorial Hall was the architectural inspiration for the German capitol, the Reichstag building in Berlin.

After the exposition, Memorial Hall reopened in 1877 as the Pennsylvania Museum of Art and included the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art. In 1928 the museum moved to Fairmount at the head of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, and in 1938 was renamed the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Memorial Hall continued to house the school, and afterward was taken over by the Fairmount Park Commission in 1958. The museum school is now the University of the Arts. Used for a time as a police station, the building now houses the Please Touch Museum, which includes a faithful 20x30-foot model of the exposition grounds and 200 buildings.

=== Women&#x27;s Pavilion ===

The Women&#x27;s Pavilion was the first structure at an international exposition to highlight the work of women, with exhibits created and operated by women. Female organizers drew upon deep-rooted traditions of separatism and sorority in planning, fundraising, and managing a pavilion devoted entirely to the artistic and industrial pursuits of their gender. They had to build their own structure because they lost their spot in one of the larger pavilions (the Main Building) due to an unexpected increase in the participation of foreign countries. Their aim was to employ only women in the construction of the pavilion and even to power it, and they succeeded with the exception of the design by Hermann J. Schwarzmann. Their overarching goal was to advance women&#x27;s social, economic, and legal standing, abolish restrictions discriminating against their gender, encourage sexual harmony, and gain influence, leverage, and freedom for all women in and outside of the home by increasing women&#x27;s confidence and ability to choose.

A project of the Women&#x27;s Centennial Executive Committee, the Women&#x27;s Pavilion was commissioned in 1873 by the United States Centennial Board of Finance with the expectation that it would generate enthusiasm for the celebration of the fair and increase subscriptions to exposition stock. Elizabeth Duane Gillespie, president of the Women&#x27;s Centennial Committee, led the effort to gather 82,000 signatures in two days to raise money for the pavilion. Gillespie also helped convince Congress to grant additional funding. It took only four months to raise the funds for the pavilion.

Much of the pavilion was devoted to human ecology and home economics. On exhibit were over 80 patented inventions, including a reliance stove, a hand attachment for sewing machines, a dishwasher, a fountain griddle-greaser, a heating iron with removable handle, a frame for stretching and drying lace curtains, and a stocking and glove darner. The Centennial women not only showed domestic production but also employed a popular means for justifying female autonomy outside of the home by demonstrating to visitors the many ways women were making a profitable living. Exhibits demonstrated positive achievements and women&#x27;s influence in domains such as industrial and fine arts (wood-carvings, furniture-making, and ceramics), fancy articles (clothing and woven goods), and philanthropy as well as philosophy, science, medicine, education, and literature.

Mexico participated in the pavilion&#x27;s exhibits, indicating the growth of a sector of elite women during the Porfirio Díaz regime of the late nineteenth century, with many individual women sending examples of woven textiles and embroidery.

=== Other buildings ===
Eleven nations had their own exhibition buildings, and others contributed small structures, including the Swedish School house referenced below, now in Central Park, New York City. The British buildings were extensive and exhibited the evolved bicycle, with tension spokes and a large front wheel. Two English manufacturers, Bayless Thomas and Rudge, displayed their high-wheel bikes (called &quot;ordinary bikes&quot; or &quot;penny farthings&quot;) at the exposition. The bicycle displays inspired Albert Augustus Pope to begin making high-wheel bikes in the United States. He started the Columbia Bike Company and published a journal called &quot;LAW Bulletin and Good Roads&quot;, which was the beginning of the Good Roads Movement.. The main British building, also known as St. George&#x27;s Hall or the English Commission Building, survived at its original site as Fairmount Park offices until it was demolished in 1961.

26 of the 37 U.S. states constructed buildings along States Drive in the exhibition grounds. Only three such state houses are still extant: the Ohio House at its original location in Fairmount Park, the Maryland House, which was moved to Druid Hill Park in Baltimore, where it is extant today, and the Missouri House, which was moved to Spring Lake, New Jersey, along with several other exhibition buildings, some of which are still extant in various Jersey Shore towns.

The United States government had a cross-shaped building that held exhibits from various government departments. The remaining structures were corporate exhibitions, administration buildings, restaurants, and other buildings designed for public comfort.

==Exposition==
The formal name of the exposition was the International Exhibition of Arts, Manufactures, and Products of the Soil and Mine, but the official theme was the celebration of the United States centennial. This was reinforced by promotional tie-ins, such as the publication of Kate Harrington&#x27;s &quot;Centennial, and Other Poems&quot;, which celebrated the exposition and the centennial.

At the same time, the exposition was designed to show the world the United States&#x27; industrial and innovative prowess. The exposition was originally scheduled to open in April, marking the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, but construction delays caused the date to be pushed back to May 10. Bells rang all over Philadelphia to signal the exposition&#x27;s opening. The opening ceremony was attended by President Ulysses Grant and his wife as well as Emperor Pedro II of Brazil and his wife. A cantata commissioned for the occasion written by Dudley Buck and Sidney Lanier was performed. The opening ceremony concluded in Machinery Hall, with Grant and Pedro II turning on the Corliss Steam Engine which powered most of the other machines at the exposition. The official number of first day attendees was 186,272 people, with 110,000 entering with free passes.

In the days following the opening ceremony, attendance dropped dramatically, with only 12,720 people visiting the exposition the next day. The average daily attendance for May was 36,000 and for June 39,000. A severe heat wave began in mid-June and continued into July, hurting attendance. The average temperature was , and on ten days during the heat wave the temperature reached . The average daily attendance for July was 35,000, but it rose in August to 42,000 despite the return of high temperatures at the end of the month.

Cooling temperatures, news reports, and word of mouth began increasing attendance in the final three months of the exposition, with many of the visitors coming from farther distances. In September the average daily attendance rose to 94,000 and in October to 102,000. The highest attendance date of the entire exposition was September 28. The day, which saw about a quarter of a million people attend, was Pennsylvania Day. It celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, and exposition events included speeches, receptions, and fireworks. The final month of the exposition, November, had an average daily attendance of 115,000. By the time the exposition ended on November 10, a total of 10,164,489 had visited the fair. Among the attendees who were duly impressed by the exposition were Princeton University sophomore Woodrow Wilson and his minister father, Joseph Ruggles Wilson, visiting from North Carolina.

Although not financially successful for investors, the Centennial Exposition impressed foreigners with the industrial and commercial growth of the country. The level of exports increased, the level of imports decreased, and the trade balance grew in favor of the United States.

== Inventions ==

The Centennial Monorail featured a steam locomotive and passenger car that straddled a single elevated iron rail. Mass-produced products and new inventions were on display within Machinery Hall. Inventions included the typewriter and electric pen along with new types of mass-produced sewing machines, stoves, lanterns, guns, wagons, carriages, and agricultural equipment.

The exposition also featured many well-known products including Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s first telephone, set up at opposite ends of Machinery Hall, Thomas Edison&#x27;s automatic telegraph system, screw-cutting machines that dramatically improved the production of screws and bolts from 8,000 to 100,000 per day, and a universal grinding machine by the Brown &amp; Sharpe Manufacturing Company.

Air-powered tools along with a mechanical calculator by George B. Grant were exhibited. John A. Roebling &amp; Sons Company displayed a slice of their 5 ¾ inch diameter cable to be used for the Brooklyn Bridge. New food products such as popcorn and ketchup, along with root beer, were also exhibited.

Consumer products first displayed to the public include:
* Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s telephone
* The Sholes and Glidden typewriter (also known as the Remington No. 1)
* Heinz Ketchup
* Wallace-Farmer Electric Dynamo, precursor to electric light
* Hires Root Beer
* Kudzu erosion control plant species

==Exhibits==

The right arm and torch of the Statue of Liberty were showcased at the exposition. For a fee of 50 cents, visitors could climb the ladder to the balcony, and the money raised this way was used to fund the pedestal for the statue.

Technologies introduced at the fair include the Corliss Steam Engine. Pennsylvania Railroad displayed the &quot;John Bull&quot; steam locomotive that was originally built in 1831. The Waltham Watch Company displayed the first automatic screw-making machinery and won the Gold Medal in the first international watch precision competition. Until the start of 2004, many of the exposition&#x27;s exhibits were displayed in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Arts and Industries Building in Washington, D.C., adjacent to the Castle building.

The German Empire, which had recently been founded after the German victory in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, did not send a very big contribution. Its main contributor were the Krupp steelworks, which sent in 37 civilian (mainly railway) items and 9 artillery items. Its big 35.5 cm gun of 57t was the showpiece of its contribution and drew quite some attention. It was kind of a tradition for Krupp to promote its trade mark by exhibiting its heaviest gun at each world&#x27;s fair. However, the Philadelphia 57t gun was considerably lighter than the British 40 cm gun of 80t which was made at the same time.

The French contribution centered on art. Its showpiece was the Gothic Revival high altar that Edward Sorin, founder of University of Notre Dame, had commissioned from the workshop of Désiré Froc-Robert &amp; Sons in Paris. After the exposition, the altar was installed at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart on Notre Dame&#x27;s campus where it remains to this day.

For Mexico, which was emerging from a long period of internal disorder and foreign invasions, the exposition was an opportunity for the Liberal regime of President Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada to garner international recognition of his regime and to counter anti-Mexican public opinion in the United States. Prominent Mexican painters including José María Velasco, José Obregón, and Santiago Rebull exhibited there. Velasco&#x27;s work was greatly admired, gaining him international recognition and enhancing his standing in Mexico.

The Swedish Cottage, representing a rural Swedish schoolhouse of traditional style, was re-erected in Central Park in New York City, after the exposition closed. It is now the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre.

The Japan exhibit included a pavilion, house, and garden with one of the first &quot;dwarfed trees&quot; to be displayed outside of Japan.

The official state pavilion of New Jersey was a reconstruction of the Ford Mansion in Morristown, New Jersey, which served as General George Washington&#x27;s headquarters during the winter of 1779–80. Featuring costumed presenters and a &quot;colonial kitchen&quot; complete with a spinning wheel, the reconstructed mansion was accompanied by a polemical narrative about &quot;old-fashioned domesticity&quot;. This quaint hearth-and-home interpretation of the colonial past was counterposed to the theme of progress, with the overarching theme of the exposition serving to reinforce a view of American progress as evolving from a small, hardy colonial stock rather than from a continual influx of multi-ethnic waves of immigration. It sparked an era of &quot;Colonial Revival&quot; in American architecture and house furnishings.

Beaver Falls Cutlery Company exhibited the &quot;largest knife and fork in the world&quot; made by Chinese immigrant workers, among others.

<text>Isla Culebra (, &quot;Snake Island&quot;) is an island, town and municipality of Puerto Rico, and together with Vieques, it is geographically part of the Spanish Virgin Islands. It is located approximately east of the Puerto Rican mainland, west of St. Thomas and north of Vieques. Culebra is spread over 5 barrios and Culebra Pueblo (Dewey), the main town and the administrative center of the island. Residents of the island are known as c&quot;ulebrenses&quot;. With a population of 1,792 as of the 2020 Census, it is Puerto Rico&#x27;s least populous municipality.

Originally called &quot;Isla del Pasaje&quot; and &quot;Isla de San Ildefonso&quot;, Culebra is also known as &quot;Isla Chiquita&quot; (&quot;Little Island&quot;), &quot;Cuna del Sol Borincano&quot; (&quot;Cradle of the Puerto Rican Sun&quot;) and &quot;Última Virgen&quot; (&quot;Last Virgin&quot;, due to its position at the end of the Virgin Islands archipelago).

==History==
Some sources claim that Christopher Columbus was the first European to arrive at the island during his second voyage on November 19, 1493. It is believed that the island was populated by Carib Indians during the colonization. After Agüeybaná and Agüeybaná II led the Taíno rebellion of 1511, Taíno Indians from the main island sought refuge on Culebra and allied with Caribs to launch random attacks at the island estates.

After that, the island was left abandoned for centuries. During the era of Spanish commerce through the Americas, it was used as a refuge for pirates, as well as local fishermen and sailors. Some sources mention a black overseer from British-ruled Tortola named John Stevens, who was put in charge of Culebra in the 1850s by the Governor of Vieques under the Spanish crown to protect the island from foreigners who, without proper permissions or payments of fees for despoiling Culebra, took fish, cut trees for lumber and prepared drift wood as charcoal for future sale elsewhere. Appropriating the unearned title of &quot;Captain&quot;, he began a decades-long isolated sojourn on Culebra as enforcer of Spanish interests. In October 1871, however, Stevens was found dead outside his hut, his body viciously hacked apart. His heart and entrails had been placed in clay pots, in an apparent religious ritual to curse his soul. Spanish police from Vieques tracked down Tortolan foragers on Culebra who were suspected of the vicious murder. Eventually 21 of them were sentenced to forced labor on sugar plantations in Vieques as punishment. The affair caused an international incident, and, to satisfy demands from the British ambassador in Madrid, the Tortolans were finally freed by the Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico in July 1874. 
These events caused the government of Switzerland in June 1876 to recall an expedition destined for Culebra to establish a warm-weather sanatorium there. Fearing further foreign encroachments, the Spanish government decided to populate Culebra with its own subjects.

Culebra was then settled by Cayetano Escudero Sanz on October 27, 1880, when he completed his survey of the island that included subdivisions into usable lots. The Spanish government offered these parcels of land to anyone who would move to the island. The first settlers depended on rain for drinking water, as the island has no natural streams. Subsistence farming and cattle raising were established and a cistern was built for common use at one end of a natural harbor or &quot;Ensenada Honda&quot; in Spanish.

This first settlement was called San Ildefonso, to honor the Bishop of Toledo, officially San Ildefonso de la Culebra. Two years later, on September 25, 1882, construction of the Culebrita lighthouse began. It was completed on February 25, 1886, which made it the oldest operating lighthouse in the Caribbean until 1975, when the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard finally closed the facility.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Culebra was 704.

In 1902, Culebra was integrated as a part of Vieques. One year later, on June 26, President Theodore Roosevelt established the Culebra Naval Reservation. A bird refuge was established on February 27, 1909.

The United States Navy cited the 1900 Foraker Act to expropriate the land surrounding the natural harbor and in 1902 ordered the removal of all settlers so that a base for the South Atlantic fleet could be erected. Antonio Lugo Suarez, a Puerto Rican who had made his fortune in St. Thomas then part of the Danish West Indies and Pedro Márquez Morales, a Spaniard who had married a Puerto Rican woman from Vieques, were successful ranchers on Culebra. Each offered an alternate site to the displaced Culebrenses, so as to prevent the total abandonment of the island. The location identified by Márquez on Playa Sardinas became the town of Dewey.

A new church was built with materials taken from San Ildefonso and a customs office was constructed.
Pedro Márquez (1850–1920) was appointed the first mayor under U.S. rule in 1905, replacing Leopoldo Padrón, the Special Delegate appointed for the transition from Spanish rule. 
Pedro Márquez was succeeded as mayor in 1912 by his son, Alejandro Márquez Laureano (1912–1914) who erected the first docks for the new town and installed electric lighting on the town&#x27;s streets. He was succeeded as mayor in 1914 by Claro C. Feliciano, the first mayor who had been born in Culebra.

With the agreement reached with a new Cuban government to lease Guantanamo Bay as a naval base, in 1911 the U.S. reduced the size of its forces on Culebra and turned the installation to training purposes. In 1924, the U.S. Navy began annual maneuvers on Culebra taking advantage of its deep-sea waters to practice coordinating amphibious landings on its beaches.

In 1939, the U.S. Navy began to use the Culebra Archipelago as a gunnery and bombing practice site. This was done in preparation for the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II. In 1971 the people of Culebra began protests, known as the Navy-Culebra protests, for the removal of the U.S. Navy from Culebra. Four years later, in 1975, the use of Culebra as a gunnery range ceased and all operations were moved to Vieques.

Culebra was declared an independent island municipality in 1917. The first democratically elected government was put into place in 1960. Prior to this, the government of Puerto Rico appointed delegates to administer the island.

On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Culebra, where Hurricane Irma had caused major damages a week prior, Hurricane Maria caused more destruction.

==Geography==
Culebra is an archipelago consisting of the main island and twenty-three smaller islands that lie off its coast. The largest of these keys are: Culebrita to the east, Cayo Norte to the northeast, and Cayo Luis Peña and Cayo Lobo to the west. The smaller islands include Cayo Ballena, Cayos Geniqui, Arrecife Culebrita, Las Hermanas, El Mono, Cayo Lobito, Cayo Botijuela, Alcarraza, Los Gemelos, and Piedra Steven. Islands in the archipelago are arid, meaning they have no rivers or streams. All of the fresh water is brought from Puerto Rico via Vieques by undersea pipeline.

Culebra is characterized by an irregular topography resulting in a long intricate shoreline. The island is approximately . The coast is marked by cliffs, sandy coral beaches and mangrove forests. Inland, the tallest point on the island is Mount Resaca, with an elevation of , followed by Balcón Hill, with an elevation of .

Ensenada Honda is the largest inlet on the island and is considered to be the most hurricane secure harbor in the Caribbean. There are also several lagoons on the island, like Corcho, Flamenco, and Zoní. Culebrita Island also has a lagoon called Molino.

Almost 80% of the island&#x27;s area is volcanic rock from the Cretaceous period. It is mostly used for livestock pasture, as well as some minor agriculture.

===Average sea temperature===
===Federal nature reserves===

These small islands are all classified as nature reserves and several nature reserves also exist on the main island. One of the oldest bird sanctuaries in United States territory was established in Culebra on February 27, 1909, by President Teddy Roosevelt. The Culebra Island giant anole (&quot;Anolis roosevelti&quot;, &quot;Xiphosurus roosevelti&quot; (according to ITIS) is an extremely rare or possibly extinct anole lizard. It is native to Culebra Island and was named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt Jr., who was the governor of Puerto Rico at that time. There are bird sanctuaries on many of the islands as well as turtle nesting sites on Culebra. Leatherback, green sea and hawksbill sea turtles use the beaches for nesting. The archipelagos bird sanctuaries are home to brown boobies, laughing gulls, sooty terns, bridled terns and noddy terns. An estimated 50,000 seabirds find their way back to the sanctuaries every year. These nature reserves comprise of the archipelago&#x27;s . These nature reserves are protected by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

Culebra has no natural large mammals. However, a population of white-tailed deer introduced in July 1966 (one male and three females) can be found on the eastern region of the island.

===National protected area===
*Culebra National Wildlife Refuge
===Important Bird Area===
Culebra, along with its adjacent islets and cays, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support seabird breeding colonies of brown boobies, brown noddies, and both sooty and royal terns.

===Barrios===
Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Culebra is subdivided into barrios.
===Sectors===

Barrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions) are further subdivided into smaller areas called (&quot;sectors&quot; in English). The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

==Tourism==

Culebra is a popular weekend tourist destination for mainland Puerto Ricans, Americans and residents of Vieques.
Culebra has many beaches including Flamenco Beach (&quot;Playa Flamenco&quot;), rated third best beach in the world for 2014 by TripAdvisor. In November 2017 Forbes rated it #19 of the top 50 beaches around the world. It can be reached by shuttle buses from the ferry. The beach extends for a mile of white coral sand and is framed beautifully by arid tree-covered hills. The beach is also protected by the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources as a marine wildlife reserve.

The area west of Flamenco Beach and the adjacent Flamenco Point were used for joint-United States Navy/Marine Corps military exercises until 1975. Two old M4 Sherman tanks, which were used for target practice, can be found at the beach. Culebra and Vieques offered the U.S. military training areas for the Fleet Marine Force in amphibious exercises for beach landings and naval gunfire support testing. Culebra and Vieques were the two components of the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range Inner Range. In recent years, only the shortened term &quot;Inner Range&quot; was used.
Other beaches are only accessible by private car or boats. Of the smaller islands, only Culebrita and Luis Peña permit visitors and can be accessible via water taxis from Culebra. Hiking and nature photography are encouraged on the small islands. However, activities which would disturb the nature reserves are prohibited, e.g. camping, littering and the use of motor vehicles. Camping, however, is allowed on Flamenco Beach throughout the year. Reservations are recommended.
Culebra is also a popular destination for scuba divers because of the many reefs throughout the archipelago and the crystal clear waters. Because of the &quot;arid&quot; nature of the island there is no run-off from rivers or streams, resulting in very clear waters around the archipelago.

==Navy Culebra protests==
The Navy–Culebra protests is the name given by American media to a series of protests starting in 1971 on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico against the United States Navy use of the island. The protests led to the U.S. Navy abandoning its facilities on Culebra.

The historical backdrop was that in 1902, three years after the U.S. invasion of Puerto Rico, Culebra was integrated as a part of Vieques. But on June 26, 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt established the Culebra Naval Reservation in Culebra. The suitability of Culebra and its topography for the technical requirements of naval gunfire and aircraft weapons exercises was recognized in 1936, and the Government of the United States declared Culebra and its adjacent waters as the Culebra Naval Defensive Sea Area in 1941. This military defense area included all coastal waters from high-tide elevation to three miles off shore. The naval gunnery and aircraft weapons ranges at Culebra played a considerable role, along with other gunnery facilities near Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, in the combat readiness of Allied Naval Forces during the Second World War. These Caribbean ranges again served as primary weapons training grounds for both Naval Gunfire Support Exercises and aircraft weapons systems proficiency during the critical period of the Korean War starting in the summer of 1950. The United States Naval exercises reached a peak in 1969, as many ships and air units were attached to the Atlantic Fleet for gunnery and aerial ordnance proficiency prior to their ultimate assignments to naval task forces stationed in Southeast Asia.

In 1971 the people of Culebra began the protests for the removal of the U.S. Navy from Culebra. The protests were led by Ruben Berrios, President of the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), a well-regarded attorney in international rights, President-Honorary of the Socialist International, and Law professor at the University of Puerto Rico. An ecumenical chapel was built on Flamenco Beach, in an action led by Catholic Bishop Antulio Parilla Bonilla, Baptist minister, Luis Rivera Pagán, and George Lakey of the Quaker Action Committee. Berrios and other protesters squatted in Culebra for a few days. Some of them, including Berrios, were arrested and imprisoned for civil disobedience. The official charge was trespassing on U.S. military territory. The protests led to the U.S. Navy discontinuing the use of Culebra as a gunnery range in 1975 and all of its operations were moved to Vieques. The case against the Navy was led by Washington lawyer Richard Copaken as retained pro-bono by the people of Culebra island.

The cleaning process of the island has been slow. At the end of 2016, the United States Army Corps of Engineers sent letters to the residents of Culebra citing active removal of undetonated explosive material still present on the island.

==In popular culture==
*Two British sailing ships, the brig HMS &quot;Triton&quot; and the merchantman &quot;Topaz&quot;, are wrecked by a hurricane and come to rest with their crews on Isla Culebra in the novel &quot;Governor Ramage R.N.&quot; by Dudley Pope
*As the site of an alleged buried treasure, Culebra is featured in the 2018 Netflix docudrama &quot;The Legend of Cocaine Island&quot;.

<text>To take something with a &quot;grain of salt&quot; or &quot;pinch of salt&quot; is an English idiom that suggests to view something, specifically claims that may be misleading or unverified, with skepticism or not to interpret something literally. 

In the old-fashioned English units of weight, a grain weighs approximately 65 mg, which is about how much table salt a person might pick up between the fingers as a pinch.

== History ==
The phrase is thought to come from Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;, regarding the discovery of a recipe written by the Pontic king Mithridates to make someone immune to poison. One of the ingredients in the recipe was a grain of salt. Threats involving poison were thus to be taken &quot;with a grain of salt&quot;, and therefore less seriously.

The phrase (&quot;with a grain of salt&quot;) is not what Pliny wrote. It is constructed according to the grammar of modern European languages rather than Classical Latin. Pliny&#x27;s actual words were (&quot;after having added a grain of salt&quot;).

The Latin word ( is the genitive) means both &quot;salt&quot; and &quot;wit&quot;, thus the Latin phrase could be translated to either &quot;with a grain of salt&quot; or &quot;with a grain of wit&quot;, actually to &quot;with caution&quot;/cautiously.

The phrase is typically said &quot;with a pinch of salt&quot; in British English and said &quot;with a grain of salt&quot; in American English.

<text>Michael John Myers (born May 25, 1963) is a Canadian actor, comedian, and filmmaker. His accolades include seven MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2002, he was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2017, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada for &quot;his extensive and acclaimed body of comedic work as an actor, writer, and producer.&quot;

Following a series of appearances on several Canadian television programs, Mike Myers attained recognition during his six seasons as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1989 to 1995, which won him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series. He subsequently earned praise and numerous accolades for playing the title roles in the &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992–1993), &quot;Austin Powers&quot; (1997–2002), and &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001–present) franchises, the latter of which is the second highest-grossing animated film franchise. Myers also played the titular character in the 2003 live-action adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;.

Myers acted sporadically in the 2010s, having supporting roles in &quot;Terminal&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (both 2018). He made his directorial debut with the documentary &quot;&quot; (2013), which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. He created and starred in the 2022 Netflix original series, &quot;The Pentaverate&quot;, and appeared in David O. Russell&#x27;s comedy thriller &quot;Amsterdam&quot;.

== Early life ==
Michael John Myers was born in Scarborough, Ontario, on May 25, 1963, to data processor Alice &quot;Bunny&quot; E. (née Hind) and insurance agent Eric Myers. His parents were British immigrants from the Old Swan area of Liverpool. Both were World War II veterans, his mother having served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force and his father in the Royal Engineers. He has distant Scottish ancestry. He has two older brothers: Paul, a musician, and Peter, who worked for Sears Canada. He grew up in Scarborough and North York, where he attended Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute. He graduated from Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute in 1982.

One of his neighbours and schoolmates was prominent voice actor Maurice LaMarche.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Myers began performing in commercials at two years old. At the age of 10, he made a commercial for British Columbia Hydro, with Gilda Radner playing his mother. At 12, he made a guest appearance as Ari on the TV series &quot;King of Kensington&quot;. At 16, he was the guest star of the season 1 episode &quot;Boy on Wheels&quot; of the TV series &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;.

After graduating from high school, Myers was accepted into The Second City Canadian touring company. He moved to the United Kingdom, and in 1985 he was one of the founding members of The Comedy Store Players, an improvisational group based at The Comedy Store in London.

The next year, he starred in the British children&#x27;s TV program &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;, parodying the show&#x27;s normal exuberance with his own &quot;Sound Asleep Club&quot;, in partnership with Neil Mullarkey.

He returned to Toronto and The Second City in 1986 as a cast member in The Second City&#x27;s Toronto main stage show, Second City Theatre. In 1988, he moved from Second City in Toronto to Chicago. There, he trained, performed and taught at the Improv Olympic.

Myers made many appearances, including as Wayne Campbell, on Toronto&#x27;s Citytv in the early 1980s, on the alternative video show &quot;City Limits&quot; hosted by Christopher Ward; Myers also made several appearances after the launch of MuchMusic, for which &quot;City Limits&quot; was essentially the prototype. Myers also appeared as Wayne Campbell in the music video for Ward&#x27;s Canadian hit &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;.

The Wayne Campbell character was featured extensively in the 1986 summer series &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, produced by Toronto&#x27;s Insight Production Company for CBC Television. Wayne appeared both in-studio and in a series of location sketches directed and edited by Allan Novak. Myers wrote another sketch, &quot;Kurt and Dieter&quot;, co-starring with Second City&#x27;s Dana Andersen and also directed by Novak, which later became the popular &quot;Sprockets&quot; sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

=== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ===
Myers began appearing on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on January 21, 1989, and eventually became the first repertory player added to the show&#x27;s cast in over two years. &quot;He quickly became one of the show&#x27;s biggest draws thanks to his talent for creating oddball characters with memorable catchphrases,&quot; according to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. In addition to &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Sprockets&quot;, Myers starred in the recurring sketches &quot;Lothar of the Hill People&quot;, &quot;Stuart Rankin, All Things Scottish&quot;, &quot;Lank Thompson&quot;, &quot;Middle-Aged Man&quot;, &quot;Simon&quot;, &quot;Coffee Talk with Linda Richman&quot;, &quot;Theatre Stories&quot;, &quot;Phillip the Hyper Hypo&quot;, and &quot;Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly&quot;. Myers&#x27;s last episode as a cast member aired on January 21, 1995 (exactly six years to the day after his first episode aired). He returned to host in 1997 and made an appearance as his movie character Dr. Evil in 2014.

=== Film ===

Myers made his film debut when he and Dana Carvey adapted their &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL) sketches into the feature &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992). It was among the most successful films of the year and was followed in 1993 by &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;; Myers starred in &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; the same year. He took a two-year hiatus from performing after the end of his time as an &quot;SNL&quot; regular.

Myers returned to acting with the film &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997), followed by the sequels &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999) and &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002). Myers played the title role (Austin Powers) and the villain (Dr. Evil) in all three films as well as a henchman (Fat Bastard) and another villain (Goldmember) in the sequels.

One of Myers&#x27;s rare non-comedic roles came in the film &quot;54&quot; (1998), in which he portrayed Steve Rubell, proprietor of New York City&#x27;s famous 1970s disco nightclub Studio 54. The film was not critically or commercially successful, though Myers received some positive notice.

In June 2000, Myers was sued by Universal Pictures for 3.8 million for backing out of a contract to make a feature film based on his &quot;SNL&quot; character Dieter. Myers said he refused to honour the 20 million contract because he felt his script was not ready. Myers countersued and a settlement was reached after several months where Myers agreed to make another film with Universal. That film, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, was released in November 2003 and starred Myers as the title character. It received negative reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office.

In 2001, Myers provided the voice of Shrek in the animated film of the same name, having taken over the role after the originally planned voice actor Chris Farley died in December 1997 before recording all of his dialogue. He reprised this role in &quot;Shrek 4-D&quot; (a theme park ride) in 2003, &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004), &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007), the Christmas and Halloween television specials &quot;Shrek the Halls&quot; (2007) and &quot;Scared Shrekless&quot; (2010), and &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; (2010).

Myers received the MTV Generation Award in June 2007, making him the second Canadian to win the award (following Jim Carrey in 2006).

In 2008, Myers co-wrote, co-produced and starred in the poorly received &quot;The Love Guru&quot;, and in 2009 had a minor role as British general Ed Fenech in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;.

In 2018, after an eight-year hiatus from feature films, Myers appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Terminal&quot; (2018) and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (2018).

As of May 2022, Myers would neither confirm nor deny plans for &quot;Austin Powers 4&quot;. In July 2024, Myers was announced to reprise the voice of the title character in &quot;Shrek 5&quot;, scheduled for release on December 23, 2026.

=== Other work ===
Myers had a cameo appearance in Britney Spears&#x27; music video &quot;Boys&quot; as Austin Powers. Britney Spears, in turn, made a cameo in &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, performing &quot;Boys&quot;. In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian, he was voted among the top 50 comedy acts by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.

Myers is a member of the band Ming Tea along with The Bangles&#x27; guitarist and vocalist Susanna Hoffs and musician Matthew Sweet. They performed the songs &quot;BBC&quot; and &quot;Daddy Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; from the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films. In 2011 Myers returned to The Comedy Store in London to perform a one-night-only comeback of his role with The Comedy Store Players. The UK comedy website Chortle praised his performance.

Myers&#x27;s 2013 directorial debut, &quot;&quot;, was selected to be screened in the Gala Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.

From 2017 to 2018, Myers hosted a re-boot of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; in heavy makeup as a fictional British host known as Tommy Maitland, though his identity was not confirmed until the second season.

An avid follower of the Monty Python comedy troupe, in July 2014, Myers appeared on stage at the O2 Arena on the final night of their 10 dates live show, &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;, and also appears on the documentary telefilm &quot;Monty Python: The Meaning of Live&quot;.

In April 2019, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Myers will be starring in and executive producing a comedy series for Netflix, which will last for six episodes and involve him playing multiple characters. In June 2021, the series title was announced as &quot;The Pentaverate&quot;, which serves as a spin-off of &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot;.

In March 2022, author and security specialist Gavin de Becker shared that segments of The Gift of Fear Master Class had been directed by Myers.

== Personal life ==

Myers began dating actress and comedy writer Robin Ruzan in the late 1980s after meeting at an ice hockey game in Chicago, during which Myers caught a puck and used the incident as an icebreaker to strike up a conversation with Ruzan. The couple married on May 22, 1993, and Myers later referred to Ruzan as &quot;his muse&quot;. The couple filed for divorce in December 2005.

In 2006, Kelly Tisdale confirmed reports that she and Myers were dating. Myers and Tisdale married in New York City in a private ceremony in late 2010. Tisdale is a scenic artist who works in the entertainment industry and a former cafe owner. They have a son and two daughters. They reside in the Tribeca neighbourhood of New York City.

Myers is a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; player and was one of several celebrities to have participated in the Worldwide &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Game Day in 2006. He supports the Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey team, and named two characters in the first &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film Commander Gilmour and General Borschevsky, after former-Maple Leafs players Doug Gilmour and Nikolai Borschevsky. He is also a fan of his parents&#x27; hometown football team Liverpool FC.

Myers has played for Hollywood United FC, a celebrity soccer team. He played in the 2010 Soccer Aid for UNICEF UK football match, England vs. R.O.W (Rest of the World) and scored his penalty during a sudden-death shootout after the game ended 2–2 (June 6, 2010). The Rest of the World team beat England for the first time since the tournament started.

In 2014, Myers starred in a commercial with his brother Peter for Sears Canada, using &quot;humorous banter to spread the message that, despite rumours, Sears wasn&#x27;t shutting down&quot;. Peter at the time was senior director of planning at Sears&#x27; head office in Toronto, and he was laid off in 2017 after Sears Canada filed for bankruptcy.

In 2016, Myers published a book, &quot;Canada&quot;, a memoir interwoven with reflections on his native country&#x27;s history and popular culture and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

In June 2018, during a guest appearance on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;, Myers stated that Britain is a &quot;rooting interest&quot; for him during soccer games in part because of his parents and because he is also a citizen of the country.

<text>David Lee Wells (born May 20, 1963) is an American former baseball pitcher who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams, most notably the Toronto Blue Jays and New York Yankees. Nicknamed &quot;Boomer&quot;, Wells was considered one of the league&#x27;s top left-handed pitchers during his career and made three All-Star appearances. In 1998, he pitched the 15th perfect game in baseball history. Wells also appeared in the postseason as a member of six teams, tied for the most with Kenny Lofton, and won two World Series titles. Following his 2007 retirement, Wells served as a broadcaster for MLB on TBS and was the host of &quot;The Cheap Seats&quot; on FOXSports.com.

==Early life==
Wells was born in Torrance, California. His parents were never married. He was raised by his mother, Eugenia, a member of Hell&#x27;s Angels also known as &quot;Attitude Annie&quot;. Wells grew up with the belief that his father, David Pritt, was dead. However, at the age of 22, he learned that Pritt was alive and tracked him down to start a new relationship with him.

Growing up in the Ocean Beach neighborhood of San Diego where he attended local public schools, Wells was dependent on his mother, who worked numerous jobs to support him and his four siblings. He graduated from Point Loma High School, where he played baseball and basketball, in 1982 and was a self-described &quot;gym rat&quot; who spent most of his time at the Ocean Beach Recreation Center and Robb Field. Wells was Point Loma High School’s star pitcher and threw a perfect game his senior year.

He had Tommy John surgery in July 1985.

==Professional career==

===Toronto Blue Jays (1987–1992)===
Wells debuted for the Toronto Blue Jays in 1987 as a reliever and did not secure a primary role in the starting rotation until he was 27 years old, starting 25 games during the 1990 season. During his six seasons with the Blue Jays, Wells compiled a 47–46 record and a 3.88 ERA. Wells was a member of the 1992 World Series winning team, the first time he got a championship ring. He was released by the Blue Jays during spring training on March 30, 1993.

===Detroit Tigers (1993–1995)===
A few days after he was released by the Blue Jays, Wells signed with the Detroit Tigers on April 3. In 1993, Wells made 32 appearances (30 starts) with an 11–9 record and a 4.19 ERA. In 1994, a season that was cut short due to a strike, Wells started 16 games, finishing 5–7 with a 3.96 ERA and 5 complete games. He emerged as a top-flight pitcher in 1995, when he was 32. After starting the year at 10–3 with a 3.04 ERA for the struggling last-place Tigers, Wells made his first All-Star Game appearance.

===Cincinnati Reds (1995)===
On July 31, Wells was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for C. J. Nitkowski, Mark Lewis, and minor leaguer Dave Tuttle. With Cincinnati, Wells compiled a 6–5 record and a 3.59 ERA.

===Baltimore Orioles (1996)===
After the 1995 season, Wells was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Curtis Goodwin and minor leaguer Trovin Valdez. In 1996, he pitched a then-career high 224 innings but finished with an 11–14 record and a 5.14 ERA.

===New York Yankees (1997–1998)===
In 1997, Wells signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees, his favorite team because of a lifelong interest in baseball legend Babe Ruth. He asked for uniform number 3, Ruth&#x27;s long-retired number, but was denied. He ended up taking 33 for the Yankees. On June 28, 1997, Wells took the mound wearing an authentic 1934 Babe Ruth hat, which he had bought for $35,000. Manager Joe Torre made Wells take it off after the first inning because it didn&#x27;t conform to uniform standards. He also fined Wells $2,500, which Wells was happy to pay and later said it was a small price to pay for the thrill of wearing the hat on the field even for one inning—even though Wells then blew a 3–0 lead as the Cleveland Indians won 12–8. After posting a 16–10 mark in 1997, Wells pitched very well in the Yankees&#x27; record-setting 1998 season. He rang up an 18–4 record, finished fifth in the league in ERA (3.49), was third in voting for the Cy Young Award, and won a second World Series ring.

====Perfect game====

On May 17, 1998, Wells pitched the 15th perfect game in baseball history, when he blanked the Minnesota Twins, 4–0. Wells attended the same San Diego high school, Point Loma High School, as Don Larsen, whose perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series was the only perfect game or no-hitter ever thrown in postseason play until 2010, and was until then the only perfect game thrown by a Yankee. (David Cone would add a third Yankee perfect game in 1999 and Domingo Germán an MLB-record fourth in 2023.) Wells claimed that he threw the perfect game while having a &quot;raging, skull-rattling hangover&quot;. Comedian Jimmy Fallon, who partied with Wells the night before the game, backed up this claim.

On September 1, 1998, Wells came fairly close to recording a second perfect game. Pitching against the Oakland Athletics, he allowed no walks and only two hits, the first of which came with two outs in the seventh inning when Jason Giambi fought off an 0–2 count and singled.

===Second stint with the Toronto Blue Jays (1999–2000)===
After the season, Wells returned to the Blue Jays as part of a trade for Roger Clemens, along with Homer Bush and Graeme Lloyd. He continued to win north of the border, with records of 17–10 and 20–8 over the next two years.

During this stint with the Blue Jays, Wells appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated just prior to the 2000 All Star Game. Though Wells said it was an honour to be on the cover, he criticized the article, &quot;The David Wells Diet: Chips, Beer and American League batters&quot; written by Jeff Pearlman, saying that Pearlman focused on Wells&#x27; diet and body shape instead of his accomplishments.

===Chicago White Sox (2001)===
Wells and pitcher Matt DeWitt were traded to the Chicago White Sox, in a deal that was quickly mired in controversy. The primary player being traded by the White Sox, starting pitcher Mike Sirotka, was injured at the time of the deal and never pitched in the major leagues again. Toronto&#x27;s general manager, Gord Ash, had not made the deal contingent on the results of a medical examination, however, and MLB ruled in favor of the White Sox. The Blue Jays thus received only Kevin Beirne, Brian Simmons, and minor leaguer Mike Williams, and the mistake ultimately cost Ash his job.

The deal did not turn out particularly well for the White Sox, either, as Wells struggled with back problems in 2001 and pitched only 100⅔ innings, finishing the 2001 season with a 5–7 record and a 4.47 ERA.

===Second stint with the New York Yankees (2002–2003)===
After a short season with the White Sox, Wells returned to the Yankees, a deal that was again immersed in controversy as he had already reached an oral agreement to join the Arizona Diamondbacks. Despite having lost some velocity from his fastball, he retained his excellent curveball and his control, and posted an outstanding 19–7 record in 2002.

Wells was the subject of some controversy prior to the 2003 season, when his autobiography &quot;Perfect I&#x27;m Not: Boomer on Beer, Brawls, Backaches and Baseball&quot;, was published. The book upset the Yankees&#x27; management, and Wells was fined $100,000 by the team for disparaging comments which appeared in it. One of them included himself having a hangover when he pitched his perfect game. Among the other controversial statements were claims that he strengthened his pitching arm as a youth by throwing rocks at homeless people and that his minor league team, the Kinston Blue Jays, had segregated stands in 1983 despite ample evidence to the contrary. Wells claimed to have been misquoted in the book, which was presumably penned by a ghost writer. The problems didn&#x27;t carry over to the field, however. Wells posted a 15–7 record and the Yankees won another pennant.

On September 28, 2003, the final day of the regular season, Wells earned the 200th win of his career in a game managed by Clemens, who had won his 300th game earlier in the season and was thought to be retiring from baseball (Clemens ended up delaying his retirement). Regular Yankees manager Joe Torre let Clemens manage the final game of the regular season, and Clemens pulled Wells from the game in the eighth inning.

Wells was criticized by some Yankees fans for not being able to pitch during Game 5 of the 2003 World Series. He started the game, but left during the first inning because of a bad backache, which forced Torre to use his bullpen to finish the game. The Yankees lost the game and the series to the Florida Marlins in six games.

===San Diego Padres (2004)===
On January 1, 2004, Wells was signed as a free agent by the San Diego Padres to a one-year contract. Wells posted a 12–8 record with a 3.73 ERA to start off his second stint in the National League.

===Boston Red Sox (2005–2006)===
On December 11, 2004, Wells signed a two-year deal with the Boston Red Sox and took the uniform number 3, in honor of Babe Ruth. He started the season poorly, and by the end of May, Wells and shortstop Édgar Rentería — another new Red Sox player who had gotten off to a slow start — switched uniform numbers, with Wells taking Rentería&#x27;s 16 and Rentería taking Wells&#x27; 3, after Rentería paid Wells for the privilege. After a stint on the DL, Wells became the same dominating pitcher he was in the past. He went on to post a 15–7 record, with a 4.45 ERA. 

After the 2005 season, Wells requested a trade back to the West Coast, but he eventually withdrew that request and resigned himself to one last year pitching for the Red Sox.
Wells began the 2006 season on the disabled list, as he was still recovering from surgery performed on his right knee. After pitching one game on April 12, he was again placed on the 15-day disabled list. He announced that if his knee did not improve he would retire. Wells came off the disabled list on May 26, to make his second start of the year against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.

===Second stint with the San Diego Padres (2006–2007)===
On August 31, 2006, with the Red Sox postseason chances fading, Wells&#x27; wish of finishing his career playing for a West Coast team and a playoff contender was granted when he was traded back to the Padres for top catching prospect George Kottaras.

Following the 2006 season, Wells filed for free agency. For players who are already planning on retiring, this is a customary move in case one changes his mind. Wells&#x27; agent had stated the pitcher will keep his options open but his physical condition will play a large part in making the final decision whether or not to return for another season. Eventually, Wells decided to stay with the Padres, agreeing in principle on a one-year deal worth $3 million in base salary with a possible $4 million more in incentives.

On March 18, 2007, the media revealed that Wells has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. This form of diabetes is more closely associated with lifestyle factors, such as diet, but the condition of people with a genetic disposition for diabetes can be exacerbated with chronic high blood sugar, as insulin resistance can be an adaptation of insulin in the wake of too-high blood sugar over time.

On August 8, the Padres announced they would cut ties with Wells when Chris Young was ready to come off the disabled list.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2007)===
On August 23, 2007, Wells was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers. His first start with the Dodgers was on August 26 against the New York Mets. He pitched five innings and allowed two earned runs. Wells also reached first base on a bunt single, scored a run, and earned the victory. He was the oldest pitcher to start a game for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

On September 13, 2007, against his former team, the San Diego Padres, Wells had his first multi-hit game of his 21-year career at the age of 44. He hit a single and a double off former teammate Greg Maddux. Wells finished the season with the Dodgers going 4–1 with a 5.12 ERA. Wells filed for free agency after the 2007 season.

==Old Timers Day and retirement==
On August 2, 2008, Wells took part in the 62nd Annual Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium, where he said that he was not going to officially retire, but admitted that his pitching career was probably over.

==Post-retirement activities==

===Personal life===
As of 2011, Wells has lived in San Diego with his wife and two sons. He has tattoos of Babe Ruth and his two sons.

===Broadcasting===

Beginning in 2009, Wells began working for MLB on TBS doing regular and postseason coverage. In 2011, Wells became host of &quot;The Cheap Seats&quot; on FOXSports.com. In 2019, Wells began providing color commentary for the YES Network.

===Interviews, biographies, and autobiographies===
In 2010, David Wells was interviewed by Jane Mitchell for the television show &quot;One on One&quot;. In addition to David&#x27;s story in his own words, the interview featured Kevin Towers, Trevor Hoffman, Josh Barfield, Chris Young, Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter, Clay Hensley, family, and friends, all sharing their personal experiences and thoughts about David.

===Coaching===
Wells served as a baseball assistant coach at his alma mater Point Loma High School for several years. The high school announced on June 17, 2014, that Wells would be its head baseball coach, starting with the 2014–2015 school year. The team&#x27;s home field was named David Wells Field in 2010. In 2014, David Wells Field went through a $2-million renovation which was underwritten by the San Diego Unified School District and David Wells. In 2018, Wells stepped down as head baseball coach at PLHS, saying he needed more time to spend on his other pursuits and projects.

<text>Scouting in Missouri has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day.

==Early history (1910-1950)==

According to William D. Murray, a charter member of the Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) when it incorporated on February 8, 1910, the first &quot;Troop&quot; to form in Missouri was formed by an Englishman in Sedalia, MO sometime in 1908 or 1909. In his 1937 book &quot;The History of the Boy Scouts of America,&quot; he goes on to say that this man had even gone so far as to appoint field representatives in other states as well.

The 1938 National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meeting was held at Irondale, Missouri.

==Boy Scouts of America in Missouri today==
There are six BSA local councils in Missouri.

===Great Rivers Council===
Great Rivers Council (653) is based in Columbia, Missouri and serves Scouts in 33 counties in Mid-Missouri. In 1971 Great Rivers Council merged with Lake of the Ozarks Council (314).

====Districts====
*Black Diamond is located in Randolph, Schuyler, Sullivan, Putnam, Adair, Scotland, Knox, Linn, Macon, and Western Shelby, counties.
*Boonslick is located in Boone, Cooper and Howard counties
*Five Rivers is located in Cole, Osage, Gasconade and Maries counties.
*Grand Prairie is located in Callaway, Audrain and Montgomery counties.
*Kinderhook is located in Morgan, Moniteau and Camden counties.
*Mark Twain is located in Pike, Ralls, Lewis, Monroe, Marion and Eastern Shelby counties.
*Osage Trails is located in Chariton, Saline, Pettis and Benton counties.

====Lake of the Ozarks Scout Reservation====

The Council operates Lake of the Ozarks Scout Reservation, also known as Camp Hohn. Scouts BSA and Venturing Camps are offered at Hohn. The camp is available for year-round use by Scout units for a variety of activities. 
Lake of the Ozarks Scout Reservation is located on the Lake of the Ozarks Osage Arm at mile marker 44 near Laurie, Missouri. The camp offers facilities and equipment available for unit use and the Kit Carson Trail, an eight-mile-long perimeter trail which winds through the hills and along the bluff overlooking the Lake. The Lake of the Ozarks Scout Reservation is home to the Sinquefield Invention Lab, Program Building and Welding/Blacksmithing Shop. The Sinquefield Invention Lab and Program Building was opened in May 2017, and is currently the only invention lab in the entire Boy Scouts of America. The Welding/Blacksmithing Shop opened in 2019. The facility has 9 labs: electronics &amp; robotics, 2D design &amp; woodworking, 3D modeling, blacksmithing, print &amp; design, multimedia, leadership, business &amp; ethics, and creativity. The Sinquefield Invention Lab and Program Building is used year-round as a merit-badge workshop, camping facility, and training center.

In addition, the Great Rivers Council has two mobile invention labs. These labs can be hooked onto a truck and taken anywhere in the council.

With the addition of the Sinquefield Invention Lab &amp; Program Building, the Lake of the Ozarks Scout Reservation is currently the only Scouts BSA camp where scouts have access to an invention lab, a COPE/Climbing course, shooting sports, and a full aquatics program.

==== Camp Thunderbird ====
Started 1960 (based on its 50th-anniversary in 2010), now closed.

Located in Randolph County Latitude 39.542258 Longitude -92.3293471 on Lake Thunderbird.

* 547 acres 12 group campsites Platform tents provided.
* Dining Hall or Patrol Cooking 33 Merit Badges offered.

====Order of the Arrow====
The council is served by the Nampa Tsi lodge.

In 1971 Meta #216 and Po-E-Mo #426 merged. This merge took place after the Great Rivers Council merged with the Lake of the Ozark Council. The name Nampa-Tsi translated means &quot;twin lodges.&quot;

There have been different designs for the lodge pocket flap. The original design of our lodge flap, by Vigil Honor James Quick, had an Osage (pronounced Oh-Song-Eh) Indian with a reservation hat, a coup staff, a flaming arrow, a lake and rivers, and two tepees. Some think that the hat was worn by the Osage Indian because they traded with settlers. This was not the case. The hats were taken as coup from pioneer settlers after they had been scalped.

====Sons of Daniel Boone====
Originally, the Sons of Daniel Boone was created by Daniel Carter Beard to encourage boys to go outdoors for recreation. This organization became the Boy Pioneers of America which merged with similar outdoor groups into the Boy Scouts of America in 1910. In 2006, the Sons of Daniel Boone reemerged as an honor camp society for Scouts and Scouters who have kept returning to Great Rivers Council Summer Camp.

==== Invention Scouts ====

Invention Scouts was founded in the Great Rivers Council in 2015 by Dr. Jeanne Sinquefield. It was founded as a Boy Scouts of America alternative to traditional STEM programs, which were too expensive and exclusive. The motto of Invention Scouts is &quot;become an inventor and entrepreneur for life&quot;. The program is coeducational and is available to boys and girls aged 11–21. Scouts are exposed to cutting-edge equipment such as laser engravers, 3D printers, and CNC routers among others. Invention Scouts has its own ranks: Invention Scouts, Apprentice, Journeyman, &amp; Master.

===Greater Saint Louis Area Council===
===Heart of America Council===

Heart of America Council has its headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, and serves Scouts in both Missouri and Kansas. The Council has two sponsored camps, H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation and Theodore Naish Scout Reservation. Bartle offers Mic-O-Say as an honor society, and Naish is home to the Tamegonit Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.

===Mississippi Valley Council===

Mississippi Valley Council is headquartered in Quincy, Illinois, and is served by Black Hawk Lodge #67. This council serves Scouts in Illinois, Missouri and Iowa.

===Ozark Trails Council===

Ozark Trails Council is based in Springfield, Missouri, and serves Scouts in Missouri and Kansas. Camps in the Ozark Trails Council include:

*Camp Arrowhead offers programs for all Scouts, from first-year Trailblazer to High Adventure. Camp Arrowhead is situated on approximately 650 beautiful wooded acres in the Ozark Mountains near Marshfield in southwest Missouri. The property features a lake, many miles of hiking trails, a stream, caves, a spring, and many examples of native Missouri flora and fauna.

Scouts camping at Camp Arrowhead may enjoy traditional outdoor Scouting activities – backpacking, hiking, fishing, swimming, archery and shooting – as well as more challenging “adventure” and “aquatics” programs. These include: a C.O.P.E. course, mountain biking, rappelling, canoeing, small-boat sailing and snorkeling.

*Blazing Trails District
*Frontier District
*Mo-Kan District
*Nih-Ka-Ga-Hah District

====Camp Arrowhead====
Camp Arrowhead is in Marshfield, Missouri located in Southwest Missouri.

The camp was started in 1924, and is the oldest continually operating Scouts BSA Camp west of the Mississippi River.

Camp Arrowhead offers programs for all Scouts, from first-year Trailblazer to High Adventure. Camp Arrowhead is situated on approximately 650 beautiful wooded acres in the Ozark Mountains near Marshfield in southwest Missouri. The property features a lake, many miles of hiking trails, a stream, caves, a spring, and many examples of native Missouri flora and fauna. The camp was likely named for the county&#x27;s Native American relics.

Scouts camping at Camp Arrowhead may enjoy traditional outdoor Scouting activities – backpacking, hiking, fishing, swimming, archery and shooting – as well as more challenging “adventure” and “aquatics” programs. These include: a C.O.P.E. course, mountain biking, rappelling, canoeing, small-boat sailing and snorkeling.

====Order of the Arrow====

The council is served by Wah-Sha-She Lodge #42 since 1995. Wah-Sha-She was formed from the merger of Osage Lodge #42 and Ni-Ka-Ga-Hah Lodge #91. Lodge #42 has had a strong presence in the Section, Region, and National level. It has hosted several conclaves at Camp Arrowhead and been home to many section officers.

Wah-She-She has participated in every NOAC since its formation and has sponsored several teams in dance, ceremony, and other competitions. At the 2015 NOAC, Wah-Sha-She Lodge took 1st in the basketball competition.

===Pony Express Council===

The Pony Express Council is based in Saint Joseph, Missouri, and also serves Scouts in Kansas. The Council&#x27;s summer camp is Camp Geiger, which is one of only two camps in the United States to offer Mic-O-Say rather than Order of the Arrow as the Scout honorary society. In the late 1970s, Pony Express Executive Parvin Bishop started the first Project C.O.P.E. program in the United States at the camp. After Bishop became Director of Program at the National Office, he expanded the program so that it became national.

*Crossed Arrows District
*Kanza District
*Ma-Has-Kah District
*Otoe District
*Robidoux District

====Camp Geiger====
Camp Geiger is a Scouts BSA camp on the bluffs above the Missouri River two miles (3 km) northwest of St. Joseph, Missouri in Andrew County, Missouri at used by the Pony Express Council. It is one of the only two scout camps including H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation in the United States to use Mic-O-Say rather than Order of the Arrow exclusively as its Scout honor society. It was first camp in the United States to offer Project C.O.P.E.

The camp is named for Charles Geiger, a St. Joseph physician, who donated land from his boyhood home in 1930. It replaced Camp Brinton at Agency, Missouri (named for W.E. Brinton who had loaned for the camp) which had been the Scout council&#x27;s main summer camp since 1918. Scouting executive H. Roe Bartle founded the Mic-O-Say organization at Camp Brinton in 1925 while serving as head of the Pony Express council. Bartle was to found a Mic-O-Say chapter in Kansas City, Missouri when he was transferred to being head of the Heart of America chapter in Kansas City there in 1929. However, the Kansas City chapter also includes Order of the Arrow in its offering at its Camp Naish while having Mic-O-Say exclusively at its other camp—Camp Bartle.

In 1930 Geiger announced the donation and in 1935 it opened with a Dining Hall made of native limestone. In the 1950s, the council bought land higher on the bluffs and further to the north and a &quot;new Camp Geiger&quot; was begun with the bulk of the camp moved to the higher land in 1952. The original swimming pool lower on the bluff was replaced in 1971 with a new pool on top of the bluff.

In the late 1970s the Pony Express Council began Project COPE, which is aimed at encouraging teamwork, self-confidence, trust, leadership, communication, decision-making, and problem-solving. It was championed by Pony Express Council Executive Parvin Bishop who expanded the program when he became Director of Program at the National Office. 

A new Dining Hall and Headquarters/Health Lodge buildings were built in 1992 after land was purchased on the road entering the camp.

==Baden-Powell Service Association in Missouri==

Missouri is home to the Baden-Powell Service Association&#x27;s former Chief Commissioner, David Atchley. Atchley, an Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America, joined up in 2008, after being asked to leave his local Greater St. Louis Area Council after attempting to create a non-discrimination policy for the Cub Scout pack he was Cubmaster for. He started forming youth scouting sections for the BPSA based on other Traditional Scouting groups based in Canada and Great Britain. In 2009, Atchley became Chief Commissioner. Atchley then chartered his own BPSA scout group in 2010 called 10th Daniel Boone (now defunct) in Washington, Missouri. He resigned his position as Chief Commissioner to Susan Pesznecker in August 2015.

Currently, the Baden-Powell Service Association has just one chartered scout group in Missouri, and that is in the St. Louis, Missouri area. The BPSA is an inclusive, &quot;back to basics&quot; organization that welcomes boys and girls from 5 years of age through adulthood.

===66th Confluence===
The 66th Confluence scout group was formed in November 2012 following a BPSA Brownsea Training Camp that took place September 14–16, 2012 at Klondike Park in Augusta, Missouri. Several of the newly received Rover Squires from that training returned to St. Louis to begin the formation of the scout group, the ordinal &quot;66&quot; coming from the U.S. Route 66 highway that once crossed St. Louis, as well as the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which is also in St. Louis.

<text>Scouting in Arkansas has a long history, from 1913 to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. 
==Boy Scouts of America in Arkansas==

===Early history (1910–1950)===
The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) began in Arkansas in 1913, when the Little Rock Council was chartered by the National Boy Scout Council and was directed by a volunteer commissioner. In 1920, the Little Rock Council was reclassified and W. G. Moseley became the first council executive in 1921. Two years later, the Little Rock Council was renamed to the Pulaski County Council.

In 1916, the De Soto Area Council was formed (#013). In 1916, the Blytheville Council was formed; it disbanded in 1917. In 1916, the Westark Area Council (#016) was formed. In 1916, Kia Kima Scout Reservation was opened in Hardy by the Chickasaw Council (#558).

In 1917, the Jonesboro Council (#019) was formed; it changed its name to the Saint Francis Valley Council (#019) in 1923. The council disbanded in 1930.

In 1918, the Hot Springs Council (#014) was formed; it changed its name to the Ouachita Area Council (#014) in 1925.

In 1919, the Jefferson County Council (#017) was formed; it changed its name to the Kanawha Area Council (#017) in 1930.

In 1920, the Fort Smith Council (#016) was formed; it changed its name to the Fort Smith-Van Buren Council (#016) in 1924. In 1928 the council merged into the Northwest Arkansas Council (#016). In 1926, the Ozark Council (#753) was formed; it merged into Northwest Arkansas in 1928. In 1930, the council changed its name to the Fort Smith Area Council, changing again in 1936 to the Westark Area Council (#016) .

In 1922, the Fayetteville Council (#015) was formed; it changed its name to the Eastern Arkansas Area Council (#015) in 1935.

In 1924, the Crowley Ridge Council (#677) was formed; it changed its name to the Mohawk Council (#677) in 1926.

In 1930, the Kanawha Area Council was formed; it disbanded in 1934. The council disbanded in 1930, with half of the council moving to the De Soto Area Council (#013) and the other half to the Quapaw Area Council (#018).

===Arkadelphia Boy Scout Hut===

The Arkadelphia Boy Scout Hut, located in Central Park, Arkadelphia, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Since the roof and the original shutters and windows were replaced in 1953, the Hut is precluded from being listed on the National Register under Criterion C. However, it is listed under Criterion A as a &quot;property that made a contribution to the major pattern of American history&quot;.

The Boy Scout Hut was constructed from 1938 to 1939 as a National Youth Administration (NYA) project. It is an example of the typical type of buildings constructed by the New Deal&#x27;s Works Progress Administration (WPA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and NYA during the Great Depression. However, it is the only known building constructed by the NYA and the only building designed in a Rustic style that remains standing in Arkadelphia that was designed and constructed during the New Deal era.

Aubrey Williams, Executive Director of the National Youth Administration, stated in a press release on 24 September 1937:
While the Boy Scout Hut was constructed specifically as a meeting place for two local Boy Scout troops, and its use is controlled by the Boy Scouts, the building is actually owned by the city of Arkadelphia. Starting around 1958, the Boy Scouts allowed local Girl Scout troops to use the building. Currently Cub Scout Pack 3024 and Girl Scout Troop 454 use the building.

===Boy Scouting in Arkansas today===
Currently, all BSA Scouts in the State of Arkansas are served by four area councils: the Caddo Area Council, the De Soto Area Council, the Natural State Council, and the Chickasaw Council.

====Caddo Area Council====
The Caddo Area Council serves youth in ten counties in southwest Arkansas and northeast Texas.

=====Organization=====

The council is divided into the Cossatot, Double Eagle and Longhorn districts.

=====Order of the Arrow=====
The council is supported by the Akela Wahinapay Lodge #232.

=====Camps=====
* Camp Preston Hunt - in Texarkana, Arkansas, is a year-round camping facility is used for Cub Scouts, Scouts BSA, and outside organizations. Located on the outskirts of Texarkana, Camp Preston Hunt is over 250 acres, with cabins, as well as numerous areas for primitive tent camping, a large dining hall, lake with canoes, shower facilities, cub pirate ship, and pavilions. Camp Preston Hunt is used year-round. 
====Chickasaw Council====

The Chickasaw Council serves Scouts in Crittenden County, Arkansas, as well as in Shelby County, Tennessee, and fifteen counties in northwest Mississippi. It was founded on February 22, 1916, to oversee the many Boy Scout troops already present in Memphis, Tennessee. The Chickasaw Council has two camps: Kia Kima Scout Reservation and Camp Currier. The Chickasaw Council is also home to the Order of the Arrow Ahoalan-Nachpikin Lodge 558.

====De Soto Area Council====

The De Soto Area Council serves youth in eleven counties in southeastern Arkansas.
=====Organization=====
The council is divided into three districts.

=====Camps=====
* Camp De Soto

=====Order of the Arrow=====
The council is supported by the Abooikpaagun Lodge (#399). The lodge&#x27;s headquarters is located in El Dorado and was founded in 1948, the same year the Order of the Arrow became officially integrated into the national camping program of the Boy Scouts of America.

====Quapaw Area Council====

The Quapaw Area Council is the largest in Arkansas in both area and members, and is headquartered in Little Rock. In 1927, the Pulaski County Council was renamed the Quapaw Area Council and covered several counties. In 1934, the Kanawha Area Council of Jefferson County was split between the Quapaw Area Council and the De Soto Area Council, which had a council office in El Dorado (Union County).

In 2002 and 2012 respectively, the Eastern Arkansas Area Council and Ouachita Area Council merged with the Quapaw Area Council. These mergers enlarged the Quapaw Area Council from seventeen counties to thirty-nine.

On October 26, 2023, the Quapaw Area Council Executive Board and voting membership held a special meeting and voted in favor of merging with the Westark Area Council to create the &quot;Natural State Council&quot;. Westark Area Council&#x27;s Executive Board and Membership held a similar meeting and vote on Tuesday, October 24, 2023, and also voted in favor of the resolution. The Natural State Council will be officially formed on December 1, 2023. https://www.quapawbsa.org/merger

The council serves over 18,000 youth and 3,600 adults in thirty-nine counties divided into nine districts, and approximately 100 boys become Eagle Scouts each year.

Council members who have received national honors include Dr. Raymond V. Biondo and Dr. David Briscoe, both of whom received the Silver Buffalo Award.

=====Order of the Arrow=====

The Order of the Arrow Quapaw Lodge 160 was formed with fifteen members in June 1939 and inducted sixty-two members during the summer of 1939. Today, the lodge has about 500 members.

=====Camps=====

Currently the Quapaw Area Council owns and operates the Gus Blass Scout Reservation, west of Damascus.

The first permanent camping facility for the Quapaw council was Camp Quapaw, opened in 1925. It was located on the Saline River west of Benton in Saline County. This early facility was limited, so between 1930 and 1931, fifty-five additional acres were purchased, and a mess hall was constructed. The numbers of scouts attending camp increased, which led to overuse of the facilities. Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers was considering a dam on the Saline River. This would have flooded a section of the camp.

In 1975, the council acquired Camp Kiwanis in order to accommodate more Scouts and camping activities. This was an unimproved site which included over 2,900 acres west of Damascus. It was renamed the Cove Creek Scout Reservation and opened in 1976. Camp Quapaw was then closed and later sold.

In 1981, the portion of Cove Creek that was used as a permanent summer camp was named Camp Montgomery, after Nile Montgomery, a previous scout executive. The lake was named Lake Butler, for Richard C. Butler Sr., a supporter of the local scouting program.

In 2001, the Cove Creek Scout Reservation and Camp Nile Montgomery were renamed the Gus Blass Scout Reservation and Camp Rockefeller in honor of Gus Blass II and Lieutenant Governor Winthrop P. Rockefeller, both of whom were supporters of the Boy Scout program for many years.

The Gus Blass Scout Reservation also includes the Donald W. Reynolds Scout Training Center. This facility includes a 320-seat dining hall with commercial kitchen, 88 person/28 room sleeping wing including two ADA compliant rooms, three large classrooms, an area with a large fireplace, two large terraced areas and additional camping on the adjacent property.

====Westark Area Council====

The WestArk Area Council was originally organized in July 1920. The council is divided into five districts and is headquartered in Fort Smith. It serves over 6,500 youth in seventeen counties located in northwestern Arkansas.

Starting in July 1920, the council originally included only the city of Fort Smith and was named the Fort Smith Council. From 1922 to 1937 the council underwent a number of name changes and expansions. In 1922, the council expanded to include the city of Van Buren and was named the Fort Smith – Van Buren Council. Then in 1927, the council incorporating all of Crawford and Sebastian Counties, and the portion of Franklin County south of the Arkansas River. In 1928, the council took over an additional 13 counties, 10 of which had previously been part of the Ozark Council. From 1922 to 1930 the council was named the Northwest Arkansas Council, and from 1922 to 1937 it was named the Fort Smith Area Council. Finally, in 1937 the name changed to the Westark Area Council.

The Westark Area Council currently serves over 6,500 youth in seventeen counties in northwestern Arkansas. The Council Scout Service Center is located at 1401 Old Greenwood Road, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 72901 and was built in 1963.

In 2003, the council began a Youth Diversion Program that provides an alternative to the formal court proceedings for first-time offenders and gives a second chance to those young adults who are willing to accept responsibility and move forward. Through structured activities, this program aims to reduce the recidivism rate among these youth.

=====OA=====

The council is supported by the Wachtschu Mawachpo Lodge 559. The Lodge began in 1963 with 103 members. The first Lodge chapters were Butterfield, Northwest, Ozark, and Magazine Mountain. It now has five chapters: Butterfield Trail, Magazine Mountain, Ozark, Razorback and Cornerstone.

=====Camps=====
In 1953, land for a Scout camp was purchased and developed in Camp Orr. It has been in use since 1955 and covers nearly 600 acres of the Buffalo National River Wilderness Area. It is located south of Harrison, and is the only Boy Scout Camp situated within a National Park.

In 1973 the Arkansas State Legislature permitted the Westark Area Council to purchase 2,842 acres of the Booneville Sanatorium, just south of Booneville, for a future camp development. The land development began in 1975 and completed in May 1976. Construction of the camp started in the spring of 1976. The Scout camp is now known as Rogers Scout Reservation.

The council also owns Camp Spencer, a 100-acre primitive camping facility, located on the shore of Lake Norfork, east of Mountain Home.

====High Adventure====
There is one High Adventure Scouting event in Arkansas.
* White River Canoe Race

There is also one regional High Adventure Base within Arkansas. Camp ORR High Adventure Base located in Jasper Ar off of the Buffalo National River. Camp ORR Is the first and only camp or proprietary within a National Park.
 Camp ORR is filled with over 100 miles of hiking in the Ozarks, The Buffalo river where you have access to all 165 miles to float where you please. WestArk Area Council has also opened up nearly 20 miles of high quality mountain biking within the Camp. You will also have access to countless climbing and rappelling within the Camp.

<doc id="103067" wikidata="Q145806" url="?curid=103067" title="Stand-up comedy">
<text>Stand-up comedy is a performance directed to a live audience, where the performer stands on a stage and delivers humorous and satirical monologues sometimes incorporating physical acts. These performances are typically composed of rehearsed scripts but often include varying degrees of live crowd interaction. Stand-up comedy consists of one-liners, stories, observations, or shticks that can employ props, music, impressions, magic tricks, or ventriloquism.

A performer in this genre can be known by the masculine and gender-neutral terms &quot;stand-up comedian&quot; and &quot;stand-up comic&quot;, or by the feminine term &quot;stand-up comedienne&quot;. Performances can take place in various venues, including comedy clubs, comedy festivals, bars, nightclubs, colleges, or theaters.

== History ==

Stand-up comedy originated in various traditions of popular entertainment in the late 19th century. These include vaudeville, the stump-speech monologues of minstrel shows, dime museums, concert saloons, freak shows, variety shows, medicine shows, American burlesque, English music halls, circus clown antics, Chautauqua, and humorist monologues, such as those delivered by Mark Twain in his 1866 touring show &quot;Our Fellow Savages of the Sandwich Islands&quot;.

Charles Farrar Browne (April 26, 1834 – March 6, 1867), better known by his nom de plume, Artemus Ward, is considered America&#x27;s first stand-up comedian.

The first documented use of &quot;stand-up&quot; appeared in &quot;The Stage&quot; in 1911, describing Nellie Perrier delivering &#x27;stand-up comic ditties in a chic and charming manner&#x27;. However, this referred to a performance of comedy songs rather than stand-up comedy in its modern form.

The term appeared again in the “Stage Gossip” column of &quot;The Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; on November 10, 1917. The article discussed the career of a comedian Finlay Dunn, stating that Dunn was &quot;what he calls a stand-up comedian&#x27;&quot; during the latter part of the 19th century. However, the term may have been used retrospectively.

== Genres ==

Stand-up has multiple genres and styles with their formats. Common ones include:
* Alternative: Intended to counter the established figures of mainstream comedy.
* Anecdotal comedy: Storytelling using exaggeration and humor.
* Character: A fictional persona created by the performer. 
* Deadpan: The deliberate display of emotional neutrality or no emotion, commonly as a form of comedic delivery to contrast with the ridiculousness or absurdity of the subject matter. This is also called dry humor, or dry-wit humor.
* Impressionist: Imitating notable figures.
* Insult: Consists mainly of offensive insults, usually directed at the audience or other performers.
* Musical: Humorous songs or musical parodies, sometimes without lyrics.
* Observational: Conversation on the absurdities of everyday life.
* Satire: Ridicule of people, institutions, or ideas through jokes.
* Topical: Framed around a specific topic related to current events or dealing with issues that are important or popular at the current time.
* Wordplay comedy: Tends to involve the use of tactics like puns, double entendres and rhymes to entertain audiences. Thus, delivery tends to be filled with many one-liners.
* Self-Deprecating comedy: In this genre, comedians make jokes at their own expense, often poking fun at their own flaws, insecurities, or embarrassing experiences. The humor comes from vulnerability and relatability, which can make the comedian more likable. (see: Self-deprecation) 

== Stand up performances ==
=== Opener, feature, and headliner ===

In a typical stand-up show, the host, compere, or emcee &quot;warms up&quot; the audience and introduces the other performers. This is followed by the opener, the feature, and then the headliner. The host may also act as the opener for smaller shows. Proven comics tend to earn regular bookings at clubs that are part of a chain and comedy venues. Jobbing stand-ups may perform sets at two or more venues on the same day.

=== Open mic ===
Clubs and small venues often run open mic events; these slots may be booked in advance or left for walk-ins. Comedians use open mics to work on material or to show off their skills to get an opener slot. &quot;Bringer shows&quot; are shows that require amateur performers to bring a specified number of paying guests with them to receive stage time.

=== Festivals ===
As well as being a mainstay of the comedy circuit, festivals often also showcase up-and-coming acts, with promoters and agents using the festivals to seek out new talent.

=== TV specials and albums ===
Experienced comics with a following may produce a television special or a comedy album. It may be recorded on tour or at a show advertised and performed specifically for the purpose. A TV special originally released on television, video on demand, or in film theatre&#x27;s may be re-released as an album on audio CD, LP record, or audio streaming. A &quot;half-hour special&quot; is typically between 20 and 35 minutes in runtime excluding commercial breaks and an &quot;hour-long special&quot; is typically between 40 and 65 minutes excluding commercial breaks.

== Comedy set ==

=== Routine ===
Stand-up comedians define their craft through the development of routines, which they construct and refine with jokes and interconnected &quot;bits.&quot; These bits form an interwoven narrative, leading to the &quot;closer,&quot; the final joke that ties the show&#x27;s themes together for a satisfying conclusion.

Most jokes are the juxtaposition of two incongruous things and are made up of the premise, set-up, and punchline, often adding a twist, topper, or tagline for an intensified or extra laugh. Delivery relies on the use of intonation, inflection, attitude, and timing as well as other stylistic devices, such as the rule of three, idioms, archetypes, or wordplay. Another popular joke structure is the paraprosdokian, a surprising punchline that changes the context or meaning of the setup.

In order to falsely frame their stories as true or to free themselves of responsibility for breaking social conventions, comedians can use the jester&#x27;s privilege, which is the right to discuss and mock anything freely without being punished. Social commentators have referred to the concepts of &quot;punching up&quot; and &quot;punching down&quot; in attempting to describe who should be the &quot;butt of the joke&quot;. This carries the assumption that, relative to the comedian&#x27;s own socio-political identity, comedy should &quot;punch up&quot; at the rich and powerful without &quot;punching down&quot; at those who are marginalized and less fortunate. Many comedians have criticized the cultural rhetoric concerning &quot;punching up&quot; and &quot;punching down&quot;, including Colin Quinn, who described the terms as a product of activism and &quot;not created by humorous people.&quot;

=== Joke theft ===
Appropriation and plagiarism are considered &quot;social crimes&quot; by most stand-ups. There have been several high-profile accusations of joke theft, some ending in lawsuits for copyright infringement. Those accused will sometimes claim cryptomnesia or parallel thinking, but it is difficult to successfully sue for joke theft regardless due to the idea–expression distinction.

== Audiences ==

According to Anna Spagnolli, stand-up comedy audiences &quot;are both &#x27;co-constructors of the situation&#x27; and &#x27;co-responsible for it.

In stand-up comedy, an unspoken contract with the audience allows for the exploration of unexpected, controversial, or scandalous subjects. The reception of a joke, whether met with laughter or disapproval, hinges on the audience&#x27;s understanding of the premise and appreciation of the punchline. A seasoned comic is able to instantly react to the audience&#x27;s reaction and use it to further the narrative.

Stand-up comedy, distinct from traditional performing arts, features a lone comedian directly engaging the audience. Success hinges on creating spontaneity, fostering intimacy, and deterring heckling.

Part of the appeal of stand up is in appreciation of the skill of the performer, as studies have shown that many people find the idea of standing on stage daunting; research on the subject has consistently found that the fear of public speaking is more intense than the fear of dying.

The audience is integral to live comedy, both as a foil to the comedian and as a contributing factor to the overall experience. The use of canned laughter in television comedy reveals this, with shows often seeming &quot;dry&quot; or dull without it. Shows may be filmed in front of a live audience for the same reason.

<text>Kimberlite is an igneous rock and a rare variant of peridotite. It is most commonly known to be the main host matrix for diamonds. It is named after the town of Kimberley in South Africa, where the discovery of an 83.5-carat (16.70 g) diamond called the Star of South Africa in 1869 spawned a diamond rush and led to the excavation of the open-pit mine called the Big Hole. Previously, the term kimberlite has been applied to olivine lamproites as Kimberlite II, however this has been in error.

Kimberlite occurs in the Earth&#x27;s crust in vertical structures known as kimberlite pipes, as well as igneous dykes and can also occur as horizontal sills. Kimberlite pipes are the most important source of mined diamonds today. The consensus on kimberlites is that they are formed deep within Earth&#x27;s mantle. Formation occurs at depths between 150 and 450 kilometres (93 and 280 mi), potentially from anomalously enriched exotic mantle compositions, and they are erupted rapidly and violently, often with considerable carbon dioxide and other volatile components. It is this depth of melting and generation that makes kimberlites prone to hosting diamond xenocrysts.

Despite its relative rarity, kimberlite has attracted attention because it serves as a carrier of diamonds and garnet peridotite mantle xenoliths to the Earth&#x27;s surface. Its probable derivation from depths greater than any other igneous rock type, and the extreme magma composition that it reflects in terms of low silica content and high levels of incompatible trace-element enrichment, make an understanding of kimberlite petrogenesis important. In this regard, the study of kimberlite has the potential to provide information about the composition of the deep mantle and melting processes occurring at or near the interface between the cratonic continental lithosphere and the underlying convecting asthenospheric mantle.

== Morphology and volcanology ==
Many kimberlite structures are emplaced as carrot-shaped, vertical intrusions termed &quot;pipes&quot;. This classic carrot shape is formed due to a complex intrusive process of kimberlitic magma, which inherits a large proportion of CO2 (lower amounts of H2O) in the system, which produces a deep explosive boiling stage that causes a significant amount of vertical flaring. Kimberlite classification is based on the recognition of differing rock facies. These differing facies are associated with a particular style of magmatic activity, namely crater, diatreme and hypabyssal rocks.

The morphology of kimberlite pipes and their classical carrot shape is the result of explosive diatreme volcanism from very deep mantle-derived sources. These volcanic explosions produce vertical columns of rock that rise from deep magma reservoirs. The eruptions forming these pipes fracture the surrounding rock as it explodes, bringing up unaltered xenoliths of peridotite to surface. These xenoliths provide valuable information to geologists about mantle conditions and composition. The morphology of kimberlite pipes is varied, but includes a sheeted dyke complex of tabular, vertically dipping feeder dykes in the root of the pipe, which extends down to the mantle. Within of the surface, the highly pressured magma explodes upwards and expands to form a conical to cylindrical diatreme, which erupts to the surface. The surface expression is rarely preserved but is usually similar to a maar volcano. Kimberlite dikes and sills can be thin (1–4 meters), while pipes range in diameter from about 75 meters to 1.5 kilometers.

== Petrology ==

Both the location and origin of kimberlitic magmas are subjects of contention. Their extreme enrichment and geochemistry have led to a large amount of speculation about their origin, with models placing their source within the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) or even as deep as the transition zone. The mechanism of enrichment has also been the topic of interest with models including partial melting, assimilation of subducted sediment or derivation from a primary magma source.

Historically, kimberlites have been classified into two distinct varieties, termed &quot;basaltic&quot; and &quot;micaceous&quot; based primarily on petrographic observations. This was later revised by C. B. Smith, who renamed these divisions &quot;group I&quot; and &quot;group II&quot; based on the isotopic affinities of these rocks using the Nd, Sr, and Pb systems. Roger Mitchell later proposed that these group I and II kimberlites display such distinct differences, that they may not be as closely related as once thought. He showed that group II kimberlites show closer affinities to lamproites than they do to group I kimberlites. Hence, he reclassified group II kimberlites as orangeites to prevent confusion.

=== Group I kimberlites ===

Group-I kimberlites are of CO2-rich ultramafic potassic igneous rocks dominated by primary forsteritic olivine and carbonate minerals, with a trace-mineral assemblage of magnesian ilmenite, chromium pyrope, almandine-pyrope, chromium diopside (in some cases subcalcic), phlogopite, enstatite and of Ti-poor chromite. Group I kimberlites exhibit a distinctive inequigranular texture caused by macrocrystic () to megacrystic () phenocrysts of olivine, pyrope, chromian diopside, magnesian ilmenite, and phlogopite, in a fine- to medium-grained groundmass.

The groundmass mineralogy, which more closely resembles a true composition of the igneous rock, is dominated by carbonate and significant amounts of forsteritic olivine, with lesser amounts of pyrope garnet, Cr-diopside, magnesian ilmenite, and spinel.

=== Olivine lamproites ===

Olivine lamproites were previously called group II kimberlite or orangeite in response to the mistaken belief that they only occurred in South Africa. Their occurrence and petrology, however, are identical globally and should not be erroneously referred to as kimberlite. Olivine lamproites are ultrapotassic, peralkaline rocks rich in volatiles (dominantly H2O). The distinctive characteristic of olivine lamproites is phlogopite macrocrysts and microphenocrysts, together with groundmass micas that vary in composition from phlogopite to &quot;tetraferriphlogopite&quot; (anomalously Al-poor phlogopite requiring Fe to enter the tetrahedral site). Resorbed olivine macrocrysts and euhedral primary crystals of groundmass olivine are common but not essential constituents.

Characteristic primary phases in the groundmass include zoned pyroxenes (cores of diopside rimmed by Ti-aegirine), spinel-group minerals (magnesian chromite to titaniferous magnetite), Sr- and REE-rich perovskite, Sr-rich apatite, REE-rich phosphates (monazite, daqingshanite), potassian barian hollandite group minerals, Nb-bearing rutile and Mn-bearing ilmenite.

=== Kimberlitic indicator minerals ===

Kimberlites are peculiar igneous rocks because they contain a variety of mineral species with chemical compositions that indicate they formed under high pressure and temperature within the mantle. These minerals, such as chromium diopside (a pyroxene), chromium spinels, magnesian ilmenite, and pyrope garnets rich in chromium, are generally absent from most other igneous rocks, making them particularly useful as indicators for kimberlites.

== Geochemistry ==
Kimberlites exhibit unique geochemical characteristics that distinguish them from other igneous rocks, reflecting their origin deep within the Earth&#x27;s mantle. These features provide insights into the mantle&#x27;s composition and the processes involved in the formation and eruption of kimberlite magmas.

=== Composition ===
Kimberlites are classified as ultramafic rocks due to their high magnesium oxide (MgO) content, which typically exceeds 12%, and often surpasses 15%. This high MgO concentration indicates a mantle-derived origin, rich in olivine and other magnesium-dominant minerals. Additionally, kimberlites are ultrapotassic, with a molar ratio of potassium oxide (K2O) to aluminum oxide (Al2O3) greater than 3, suggesting significant alterations or enrichment processes in their mantle source regions.

=== Elemental abundance ===
Characteristic of kimberlites is their abundance in near-primitive elements such as nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), and cobalt (Co), with concentrations often exceeding 400 ppm for Ni, 1000 ppm for Cr, and 150 ppm for Co. These high levels reflect the primitive nature of their mantle source, having undergone minimal differentiation.

=== Rare Earth and lithophile elements ===
Kimberlites show enrichment in rare earth elements (REEs), which are pivotal for understanding their genesis and evolution. This enrichment in REEs, along with a moderate to high large-ion lithophile element (LILE) enrichment (more than 1,000 ppm) including potassium, barium, and strontium, points to a significant contribution from metasomatized mantle sources, where the rock composition has been altered by fluids.

=== Volatile content ===
A defining feature of kimberlites is their high volatile content, particularly of water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The presence of these volatiles influences the explosivity of kimberlite eruptions and facilitates the transport of diamonds from deep within the mantle to the Earth&#x27;s surface. The high levels of H2O and CO2 are indicative of a deep mantle origin, where these compounds are more abundant.

== Exploration techniques ==
Kimberlite exploration techniques encompass a multifaceted approach that integrates geological, geochemical, and geophysical methodologies to locate and evaluate potential diamond-bearing deposits.

=== Indicator minerals sampling ===
Exploration techniques for kimberlites primarily hinge on the identification and analysis of indicator minerals associated with the presence of kimberlite pipes and their potential diamond content. Sediment sampling is a fundamental approach, where kimberlite indicator minerals (KIMs) are dispersed across landscapes due to geological processes like uplift, erosion, and glaciations. Loaming and alluvial sampling are utilized in different terrains to recover KIMs from soils and stream deposits, respectively. Understanding paleodrainage patterns and geological cover layers aids in tracing KIMs back to their source kimberlite pipes. In glaciated regions, techniques such as esker sampling, till sampling, and alluvial sampling are employed to recover KIMs buried beneath thick glacial deposits. Once collected, heavy minerals are separated and sorted by hand to identify these indicators. Chemical analysis confirms their identity and categorizes them. Techniques like thermobarometry help understand the conditions under which these minerals formed and where they came from in the Earth&#x27;s mantle. By analyzing these indicators and geological curves, scientists can estimate the likelihood of finding diamonds in a kimberlite pipe. These methods help prioritize where to drill in the search for valuable diamond deposits.

=== Geophysical methods ===
Geophysical methods are particularly useful in areas where direct detection of kimberlites is challenging due to significant overburden or weathering. These methods leverage physical property contrasts between kimberlite bodies and their surrounding host rocks, enabling the detection of subtle anomalies indicative of potential kimberlite deposits. Airborne and ground surveys, including magnetics, electromagnetics, and gravity surveys, are commonly employed to acquire geophysical data over large areas efficiently. Magnetic surveys detect variations in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field caused by magnetic minerals within kimberlites, which typically exhibit distinct magnetic signatures compared to surrounding rocks. Electromagnetic surveys measure variations in electrical conductivity, with conductive kimberlite bodies producing anomalous responses. Gravity surveys detect variations in gravitational attraction caused by differences in density between kimberlite and surrounding rocks. By analyzing and interpreting these geophysical anomalies, geologists can delineate potential kimberlite targets for further investigation, such as drilling. However, the interpretation of geophysical data requires careful consideration of geological context and potential masking effects from surrounding geology, highlighting the importance of integrating geophysical results with other exploration techniques for accurate targeting and successful diamond discoveries.

=== 3-D modeling ===

Three-dimensional (3D) modeling offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the internal structure and distribution of key geological features within potential diamond-bearing deposits. This process begins with the collection and integration of various datasets, including drill-hole data, ground geophysical surveys, and geological mapping information. These datasets are then integrated into a cohesive digital platform, often utilizing specialized software packages tailored for geological modeling. Through advanced visualization techniques, geologists can create detailed 3D representations of the subsurface geology, highlighting the distribution and geometry of kimberlite bodies alongside other significant geological features such as faults, fractures, and lithological boundaries. Within the model, efforts are made to accurately depict the internal phases of kimberlite pipes, incorporating different facies, country rock xenoliths, and mantle xenoliths identified through careful interpretation of drill-core data and geophysical surveys. Once validated, the 3D model serves as a valuable decision-making tool, offering insights into potential diamond-bearing potential, identifying high-priority drilling targets, and guiding exploration strategies to maximize the chances of successful diamond discoveries.

== Historical significance ==
Kimberlites are a valuable source of information about the composition of the Earth&#x27;s mantle and the dynamic processes that occur within it. The study of kimberlites has contributed to our understanding of the Earth’s deep geochemical cycles and the mechanism of mantle plumes, which are upwellings of abnormally hot rock within the Earth&#x27;s mantle.

Moreover, kimberlites are unique in their ability to transport material from the Earth&#x27;s mantle to its surface. This process, known as xenolith transport, provides geologists with samples of the Earth&#x27;s mantle, which are otherwise inaccessible. Analyzing these samples has led to significant advances in our knowledge of the Earth&#x27;s deep interior, including its physical conditions, composition, and the evolutionary history of the planet.

The role of kimberlites in diamond exploration cannot be overstated. Diamonds are formed under the high-pressure, high-temperature conditions of the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Kimberlites act as carriers for these diamonds, transporting them to the Earth&#x27;s surface. The discovery of diamond-bearing kimberlites in the 1870s in Kimberley sparked a diamond rush, transforming the area into one of the world’s largest diamond-producing regions. Since then, the association between kimberlites and diamonds has been crucial in the search for new diamond deposits around the globe.

Kimberlites also serve as a window into the Earth&#x27;s past, offering clues about the formation of continents and the dynamic processes that shape our planet. Their distribution and age can provide insights into ancient continental movements and the assembly and breakup of supercontinents.

== Economic importance ==

Kimberlites are the most important source of primary diamonds. Many kimberlite pipes also produce rich alluvial or eluvial diamond placer deposits. about 6,400 kimberlite pipes are known on Earth including about 900 that have been found to contain diamonds, with mining of diamonds occurring at about 30 pipes.

The discovery of diamond-rich kimberlite pipes in northern Canada during the early 1990s serves as a prime example of how challenging these deposits can be to locate, as their surface features are often subtle. In this case, the pipes were hidden beneath ice-covered shallow ponds, which filled depressions formed by the softer kimberlite rock eroding slightly faster than the surrounding harder rock.
The deposits occurring at Kimberley, South Africa, were the first recognized and the source of the name. The Kimberley diamonds were originally found in weathered kimberlite, which was colored yellow by limonite, and so was called &quot;yellow ground&quot;. Deeper workings encountered less altered rock, serpentinized kimberlite, which miners call &quot;blue ground&quot;. Yellow ground kimberlite is easy to break apart and was the first source of diamonds to be mined. Blue ground kimberlite needs to be run through rock crushers to extract the diamonds.

The blue and yellow ground were both prolific producers of diamonds. After the yellow ground had been exhausted, miners in the late 19th century accidentally cut into the blue ground and found gem-quality diamonds in quantity. The economic situation at the time was such that, with a flood of diamonds being found, the miners undercut each other&#x27;s prices and eventually decreased the diamonds&#x27; value down to cost in a short time.

<doc id="103071" wikidata="Q408626" url="?curid=103071" title="Cystine">
<text>Cystine is the oxidized derivative of the amino acid cysteine and has the formula (SCH2CH(NH2)CO2H)2. It is a white solid that is poorly soluble in water. As a residue in proteins, cystine serves two functions: a site of redox reactions and a mechanical linkage that allows proteins to retain their three-dimensional structure.

==Formation and reactions==
===Structure===
Cystine is the disulfide derived from the amino acid cysteine. The conversion can be viewed as an oxidation:
Cystine contains a disulfide bond, two amine groups, and two carboxylic acid groups. As for other amino acids, the amine and carboxylic acid groups exist in rapid equilibrium with the ammonium-carboxylate tautomer. The great majority of the literature concerns the &quot;l,l-&quot;cystine, derived from &quot;l&quot;-cysteine. Other isomers include &quot;d,d&quot;-cystine and the meso isomer d,l-cystine, neither of which is biologically significant.

=== Occurrence ===
Cystine is common in many foods such as eggs, meat, dairy products, and whole grains as well as skin, horns and hair. It was not recognized as being derived of proteins until it was isolated from the horn of a cow in 1899. Human hair and skin contain approximately 10–14% cystine by mass.

=== History ===
Cystine was discovered in 1810 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston, who called it &quot;cystic oxide&quot;. In 1833, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius named the amino acid &quot;cystine&quot;. The Norwegian chemist Christian J. Thaulow determined, in 1838, the empirical formula of cystine. In 1884, the German chemist Eugen Baumann found that when cystine was treated with a reducing agent, cystine revealed itself to be a dimer of a monomer which he named &quot;cysteïne&quot;. In 1899, cystine was first isolated from protein (horn tissue) by the Swedish chemist Karl A. H. Mörner (1855-1917). The chemical structure of cystine was determined by synthesis in 1903 by the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer.

The history of cystine and cysteine is complicated by the dimer-monomer relationship of the two. The cysteine monomer was proposed as the actual unit by Embden in 1901.

The sulfur within the structure of cysteine and cystine has been subject of historical interest. In 1902, Osborne partially succeeded in analysing cystine content via lead compounds. An improved colorimetric method was developed in 1922 by Folin and Looney. An iodometric analysis method was developed by Okuda in 1925.

===Redox===
It is formed from the oxidation of two cysteine molecules, which results in the formation of a disulfide bond. In cell biology, cystine residues (found in proteins) only exist in non-reductive (oxidative) organelles, such as the secretory pathway (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vesicles) and extracellular spaces (e.g., extracellular matrix). Under reductive conditions (in the cytoplasm, nucleus, etc.) cysteine is predominant. The disulfide link is readily reduced to give the corresponding thiol cysteine. Typical thiols for this reaction are mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol:
:(SCH2CH(NH2)CO2H)2 + 2 RSH → 2 HSCH2CH(NH2)CO2H + RSSR
Because of the facility of the thiol-disulfide exchange, the nutritional benefits and sources of cystine are identical to those for the more-common cysteine. Disulfide bonds cleave more rapidly at higher temperatures.

===Cystine-based disorders===

The presence of cystine in urine is often indicative of amino acid reabsorption defects. Cystinuria has been reported to occur in dogs.
In humans the excretion of high levels of cystine crystals can be indicative of cystinosis, a rare genetic disease. Cystine stones account for about 1-2% of kidney stone disease in adults.

==Biological transport==
Cystine serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter. This transport system, which is highly specific for cystine and glutamate, increases the concentration of cystine inside the cell. In this system, the anionic form of cystine is transported in exchange for glutamate. Cystine is quickly reduced to cysteine. Cysteine prodrugs, e.g. acetylcysteine, induce release of glutamate into the extracellular space.

==Nutritional supplements==

Cysteine supplements are sometimes marketed as anti-aging products with claims of improved skin elasticity. Cysteine is more easily absorbed by the body than cystine, so most supplements contain cysteine rather than cystine. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is better absorbed than other cysteine or cystine supplements.

<doc id="103072" wikidata="Q7438561" url="?curid=103072" title="Scouting in Louisiana">
<text>Scouting in Louisiana has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910–1960)==
The first Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Troop in Louisiana was founded in 1910 in Monroe, LA by Isaac Cowden. The group of boys had formed the year before as &quot;The Newsboy&#x27;s Club&quot; and met Sundays in the Knights of Pythias Hall on St. John Street. This troop was among the first in the south. The first Scout Master to be commissioned in Louisiana was Osee W. Zeagler.

In the days of segregation, five of the seven Louisiana councils maintained a separate summer camp for Negro scouts and the other two ran a special session at the regular council camp in order that black scouts would not be denied a camping program. In the period 1957-1967, each of the &quot;Negro Scout Camps&quot; were closed and the regular councils camps were integrated. Negro camps in Louisiana were: Camp Pioneer (Norwela Council), Camp Britton (Ouachita Valley Council), Camp Chenier (Evangeline Area Council), Indian Village Scout Camp (New Orleans Area Council), and Camp Carver (Istrouma Area Council).

In 1924, the Evangeline Area Council (#212) was formed. In 1917, the Minden Council was formed, ending in 1919. In 1917, the Ruston Council was formed, ending in 1918. In 1917, the Minden Council was formed, ending in 1919. In 1923, the Fourth District Council (#213) was formed, changing its name to the Ouachita Valley Council (#213) in 1925. In 1919, the Alexandria Council (#208) was formed, changing its name to the Attakapas Council (#208) in 1921. In 1923 the council changed its name to Rapides Parish Council (#208), and back to Attakapas (#208) in 1925. Attakapas (#208) dissolved in 1925, reforming in 1938. In 1917, the Baton Rouge Council (#211) was formed, changing its name to the East Baton Rouge Parish Council (#211) in 1922. It changed its name to the Istrouma Area Council (#211) in 1924. In 1924, the Old Hickory Area Council (#657) was formed, merging into the Istrouma Area Council (#211) in 1931. 

In 1923, the Choctaw Area Council (#210) was formed. In 1919, the Calcasieu Parish Council (#209) was formed, changing its name to the Lake Charles Council (#209) in 1920. It changed its name to the Calcasieu Parish Council (#209) in 1922. In 1925, Calcasieu Parish changed its name to the Calcasieu and Cameron Parishes Council (#209). In 1930, the Choctaw Area (#210) and Calcasieu and Cameron Parishes (#209) councils merged to form the Calcasieu Area Council (#209).

In 1917, the Minden Council was formed, ending in 1919. In 1924, the Mississippi-Gulf Coast Area Council (#666) was formed, merging into the New Orleans Area Council (#214) in 1927. 

In 1916, the New Orleans Council (#214) was formed, changing its name to the New Orleans Area Council (#214) in 1927. In 1925, the ClaiBienWeb Council (#699) was formed. In 1921, the Shreveport Council (#215) was formed, changing its name to the NorWeLa Area Council (#215) in 1923. The ClaiBienWeb Council merged into the NorWeLa Area Council (#215) in 1923.

==Recent history (1960–2010)==
The Louisiana Purchase Council was formed from 2003 the merger between the Ouachita Valley and Attakapas councils. In 1999, the New Orleans Area Council (#214) changed its name to the Southeast Louisiana Council (#214).

====Order of the Arrow====
*Chilantakoba Lodge 

Before the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, Chilantakoba Lodge was the largest Order of the Arrow lodge in its section. The membership peaked around 600 but, following the storm, fell to nearly 100. The Council&#x27;s camp, and much of the area it serves, was impacted severely. There were downed trees, damaged buildings, destroyed trails, and loss of many other assets on the council&#x27;s property. Members of Chilantakoba Lodge helped in the resurrection of the Council Camp, Salmen Scout Reservation, and helped to staff the summer program, putting on three weeks of Boy Scout summer camp. It is this level of dedication, and desire to serve, that has caused Chilantakoba Lodge to produce five Lodge Chiefs who have later gone on to receive the Distinguished Service Award, the highest award for service to the Order.

<text>In neuroanatomy, a plexus (from the Latin term for &quot;braid&quot;) is a branching network of vessels or nerves. The vessels may be blood vessels (veins, capillaries) or lymphatic vessels. The nerves are typically axons outside the central nervous system. 

The standard plural form in English is plexuses. Alternatively, the Latin plural plexūs may be used.

==Types==
===Nerve plexuses===
The four primary nerve plexuses are the cervical plexus, brachial plexus, lumbar plexus, and the sacral plexus.

====Cardiac plexus====
====Celiac plexus====
====Renal plexus====
===Venous plexus===
===Choroid plexus===
The choroid plexus is a part of the central nervous system in the brain and consists of capillaries, brain ventricles, and ependymal cells.

==Invertebrates==
The plexus is the characteristic form of nervous system in the coelenterates and persists with modifications in the flatworms. The nerves of the radially symmetric echinoderms also take this form, where a plexus underlies the ectoderm of these animals and deeper in the body other nerve cells form plexuses of limited extent.
