<text>The culture of France has been shaped by geography, by historical events, and by foreign and internal forces and groups. France, and in particular Paris, has played an important role as a center of high culture since the 17th century and from the 19th century on, worldwide. From the late 19th century, France has also played an important role in cinema, fashion, cuisine, literature, technology, the social sciences, and mathematics. The importance of French culture has waxed and waned over the centuries, depending on its economic, political and military importance. French culture today is marked both by great regional and socioeconomic differences and strong unifying tendencies. A global opinion poll for the BBC saw France ranked as the country with the fourth most positive influence in the world (behind Germany, Canada and the UK) in 2014.

==French culture ==

The Académie Française sets an official standard of linguistic purism; however, this standard, which is not mandatory, is occasionally ignored by the government itself: for instance, the left-wing government of Lionel Jospin pushed for the feminisation of the names of some functions (&quot;madame la ministre&quot;) while the Académie pushed for some more traditional &quot;madame le ministre&quot;.

Some action has been taken by the government to promote French culture and the French language. For instance, they have established a system of subsidies and preferential loans for supporting French cinema. The Toubon law, from the name of the conservative culture minister who promoted it, makes it mandatory to use French in advertisements directed to the general public. Note that contrary to some misconceptions sometimes found in the Anglophone media, the French government neither regulates the language used by private parties in commercial settings, nor makes it compulsory that France-based WWW sites should be in French.

France counts many regional languages, some of them being very different from standard French, such as Breton (a Celtic language close to Cornish and Welsh) and Alsatian (an Alemannic dialect of German). Some regional languages are Roman, like French, such as Occitan. The Basque language is completely unrelated to the French language and to any other language in the world; it is spoken in an area that straddles the border between the southwest of France and the north of Spain.

Many of these languages have enthusiastic advocates; however, the real importance of local languages remains subject to debate. In April 2001, the Minister of Education, Jack Lang, admitted formally that for more than two centuries, the political powers of the French government had repressed regional languages. He announced that bilingual education would, for the first time, be recognised, and bilingual teachers recruited in French public schools to support teaching these other languages. 
In French schools, pupils are expected to learn at least two foreign languages, the first of which is typically German or English.

A revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles in July 2008.

==Religions in France==

France is a secular country where freedom of thought and of conscience which encompasses and supersedes freedom of religion is preserved, by virtue of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Republic is based on the principle of &quot;laïcité&quot;, which relies on the division between private life, where adherents believe religion belongs, and the public sphere, in which each individual should appear as a simple citizen who is equal to all other citizens, not putting the emphasis on any ethnic, religious, or other particularities. French secularism also includes freedom of conscience i.e. the freedom to believe or not to believe and even to change one&#x27;s faith across one&#x27;s life (including of agnosticism and atheism) enforced by the Jules Ferry laws and the 1905 law on the separation of the State and the Church, enacted at the beginning of the Third Republic (1871–1940). A 2011 European poll found that a third (33%) of the French population &quot;does not believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. In 2011, in a poll published by Institut français d&#x27;opinion publique 65% of the French population describes itself as Christians, and 25% as not adhering any religion.

According to Eurobarometer poll in 2012, Christianity is the largest religion in France accounting 60% of French citizens. Catholics are the largest Christian group in France, accounting for 50% of French citizens, while Protestants make up 8%, and other Christians make up 2%. Non believer/Agnostic account for 20%, Atheist 13%, and Muslim 7%.

France guarantees freedom of religion as a constitutional right, and the government generally respects this right in practice. A long history of violent conflict between groups led the state to break its ties to the established Catholic Church early in the last century, which previously had been the state religion. The government adopted a strong commitment to maintaining a totally secular public sector.

===Catholicism===

Long the established state religion, the Catholic Church has historically played a significant role in French culture and in French life. Kings were prominent members as well as head of the state and social order. Most French people are Catholics; however, many of them are secular but still place high value on Catholicism.

The Catholic faith is no longer considered the state religion, as it was before the 1789 Revolution and throughout the various, non-republican regimes of the 19th century (the Restoration, the July Monarchy and the Second Empire). The institutional split of the Catholic Church and French State (&quot;Séparation de l&#x27;Eglise et de l&#x27;Etat&quot;) was imposed by the latter in 1905 and represented the crest of a wave of the laicist and anti-clericalist movement among French Radical Republicans in this period.

At the beginning of the 20th century, France was a largely rural country with conservative Catholic mores, but in the hundred years since then, the countryside has become depopulated as people have become urbanized. The urban populations have become more secular. A December 2006 poll by Harris Interactive, published in &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, found that 32% of the French population described themselves as agnostic, some 32% as atheist, and only 27% believed in any type of God or supreme being. according to the French Market research Ipsos, Catholics today constitute 57.5% of the French population.

===Protestantism===

France was touched by the Reformation during the 16th century; some 30% of the population converted to Protestantism and became known as French Huguenots. Some princes joined the reform movement. But the national monarchy felt threatened by people who wanted to leave the established state religion. Protestants were discriminated against and suppressed. On 24 August 1572, the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre took place in Paris and the French Wars of Religion are considered to have begun. this French civil war took place between Catholics, led by Henry I, Duke of Guise, and Protestants, led by Henri de Navarre. Henri de Navarre became king after converting to Catholicism in 1589.

Louis XIII, Henri IV&#x27;s son, began to suppress Protestants in violent attacks, such as the Siege of La Rochelle. After Louis XIV revoked the Edit de Nantes in 1685, Protestants who did not leave the country were generally suppressed. Thousands of Protestant Huguenots emigrated from France for their safety and to gain religious freedom, generally going to Protestant nations such as the Netherlands, England, South Africa, and the North American colonies. Their exile continued during the 17th century and until 1787, when religious freedom was re-established by Louis XVI.

===Judaism===

The current Jewish community in France numbers around 600,000, according to the World Jewish Congress and 500,000 according to the Appel Unifié Juif de France. It is concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Paris, Marseille and Strasbourg.

The history of the Jews in France dates back over 2,000 years. In the early Middle Ages, France was a center of Jewish learning, but persecution increased as the Middle Ages wore on. France was the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution, but despite legal equality anti-Semitism remained an issue, as illustrated in the Dreyfus affair of the late 19th century. However, through the 1870 &quot;Décret Crémieux&quot;, France secured full citizenship for the Jews in then French-ruled Algeria. Despite the death of a quarter of all French Jews during the Holocaust, France currently has the largest Jewish population in Europe.

In the early 21st century, French Jews are mostly Sephardic and of North African origins. More than a quarter of the historic Ashkenazi Jewish community was destroyed during the Holocaust of World War II after German forces occupied France and established the Vichy Regime. Jewish religious affiliations range from the ultra-Orthodox Haredi communities to the large segment of Jews who are secular and identify culturally as Jews.

===Islam===
Islam is the third-largest faith in France in the early 21st century. The Grand Mosque was constructed in Paris in 1929 in honour of French colonial troops from North Africa who fought in the First World War. Arabs from North Africa started to settle in France. In the early 21st century, France had the largest Muslim population (in percentage) of any Western European country. This is a result of immigration and permanent family settlement in France, from the 1960s on, of groups from, principally, former French colonies in North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia), and, to a lesser extent, other areas such as Turkey and West Africa. The government does not collect data on religious beliefs in census records, but estimates and polls place the percentage of Muslims at between 4% and 7%.

===Buddhism===

Buddhism is widely reported to be the fifth largest religion in France, after Christianity, atheism, Islam, and Judaism. France has over two hundred Buddhist meditation centers, including about twenty sizable retreat centers in rural areas. The Buddhist population mainly consists of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants, with a substantial minority of native French converts and &quot;sympathizers&quot;. The rising popularity of Buddhism in France has been the subject of considerable discussion in the French media and academy in recent years. The Plum Village Tradition school of Buddhism was developed in France with the Plum Village Monastery located in the Dordogne.

===Cults and new religious movements===
France created in 2006 the first French parliamentary commission on cult activities which led to a report registering a number of cults considered as dangerous. Supporters of such movements have criticized the report on the grounds of the respect of religious freedom. Proponents of the measure contend that only dangerous cults have been listed as such, and state secularism ensures religious freedom in France.

==Regional customs and traditions==
Modern France is the result of centuries of nation building and the acquisition and incorporation of a number of historical provinces and overseas colonies into its geographical and political structure. These regions all evolved with their own specific cultural and linguistic traditions in fashion, religious observance, regional language and accent, family structure, cuisine, leisure activities, industry, and including the simple way to pour wine, etc.

The evolution of the French state and culture, from the Renaissance up to this day, has however promoted a centralization of politics, media and cultural production in and around Paris (and, to a lesser extent, around the other major urban centers), and the industrialization of the country in the 20th century has led to a massive move of French people from the countryside to urban areas. At the end of the 19th century, around 50% of the French depended on the land for a living; today French farmers only make up 6–7%, while 73% live in cities. Nineteenth century French literature abounds in scenes of provincial youth &quot;coming up&quot; to Paris to &quot;make it&quot; in the cultural, political or social scene of the capital (this scheme is frequent in the novels of Balzac). Policies enacted by the French Third Republic also encouraged this displacement through mandatory military service, a centralized national educational system, and suppression of regional languages. While government policy and public debate in France in recent years has returned to a valorization of regional differences and a call for decentralization of certain aspects of the public sphere (sometimes with ethnic, racial or reactionary overtones), the history of regional displacement and the nature of the modern urban environment and of mass media and culture have made the preservation of a regional &quot;sense of place or culture&quot; in today&#x27;s France extremely difficult.

The names of the historical French provinces – such as Brittany (&quot;Bretagne&quot;), Berry, Orléanais, Normandy (&quot;Normandie&quot;), Languedoc, Lyonnais, Dauphiné, Champagne, Poitou, Guyenne and Gascony (&quot;Gascogne&quot;), Burgundy (&quot;Bourgogne&quot;), Picardy (&quot;Picardie&quot;), Provence, Touraine, Limousin, Auvergne, Béarn, Alsace, Flanders, Lorraine, Corsica (&quot;Corse&quot;), Savoy (&quot;Savoie&quot;)... (please see individual articles for specifics about each regional culture) — are still used to designate natural, historical and cultural regions, and many of them appear in modern région or département names. These names are also used by the French in their self-identification of family origin.

Regional identification is most pronounced today in cultures linked to regional languages and non-French-speaking traditions – French language itself being only a dialect of Langue d&#x27;oïl, the mother language of many of the languages to-be-mentioned, which became a national vehicular language, like (in alphabetical order): Alsatian, Arpitan, Basque, Brezhoneg (Breton), Burgundian, Corsu (Corsican), Català (Catalan), Francique, Gallo, Lorrain, Norman, Occitan, Picard, Poitevin, Saintongeais, etc., and some of these regions have promoted movements calling for some degree of regional autonomy, and, occasionally, national independence (see, for example, Breton nationalism, Corsica and Occitania).

There are huge differences in life style, socioeconomic status and world view between Paris and the provinces. The French often use the expression &quot;la France profonde&quot; (&quot;Deep France&quot;, similar to &quot;&quot;) to designate the profoundly &quot;French&quot; aspects of provincial towns, village life and rural agricultural culture, which escape the hegemony of Paris. The expression can however have a pejorative meaning, similar to the expression &quot;le désert français&quot; (&quot;the French desert&quot;) used to describe a lack of acculturation of the provinces. Another expression, &quot;terroir&quot; is a French term originally used for wine and coffee to denote the special characteristics that geography bestowed upon these products. It can be very loosely translated as &quot;a sense of place&quot; which is embodied in certain qualities, and the sum of the effects that the local environment (especially the &quot;soil&quot;) has had on the growth of the product. The use of the term has since been generalized to talk about many cultural products.

In addition to its metropolitan territory, France also consists of overseas departments made up of its former colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana in the Caribbean, and Mayotte and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. (There also exists a number of &quot;overseas collectivities&quot; and &quot;overseas territories&quot;. For a full discussion, see administrative divisions of France. Since 1982, following the French government&#x27;s policy of decentralisation, overseas departments have elected regional councils with powers similar to those of the regions of metropolitan France. As a result of a constitutional revision which occurred in 2003, these regions are now to be called overseas regions.) These overseas departments have the same political status as metropolitan departments and are integral parts of France, (similar to the way in which Hawaii is a state and an integral part of the United States), yet they also have specific cultural and linguistic traditions which set them apart. Certain elements of overseas culture have also been introduced to metropolitan culture (as, for example, the musical form the biguine).

Industrialization, immigration and urbanization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have also created new socioeconomic regional communities in France, both urban (like Paris, Lyon, Villeurbanne, Lille, Marseille, etc.) and the suburban and working class hinterlands (like Seine-Saint-Denis) of urban agglomerations (called variously &quot;banlieues&quot; (&quot;suburbs&quot;, sometimes qualified as &quot;chic&quot; or &quot;pauvres&quot; or &quot;les cités&quot; &quot;housing projects&quot;)) which have developed their own &quot;sense of place&quot; and local culture (much like the various boroughs of New York City or suburbs of Los Angeles), as well as cultural identity.

==Other specific communities==
Paris has traditionally been associated with alternative, artistic or intellectual subcultures, many of which involved foreigners. Such subcultures include the &quot;Bohemians&quot; of the mid-nineteenth century, the Impressionists, artistic circles of the Belle époque (around such artists as Picasso and Alfred Jarry), the Dadaists, Surrealists, the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; (Hemingway, Gertrude Stein) and the post-war &quot;intellectuals&quot; associated with Montparnasse (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir).

France has an estimated 280,000–340,000 Roma, generally known as &quot;Gitans&quot;, &quot;Tsiganes&quot;, &quot;Romanichels&quot; (slightly pejorative), &quot;Bohémiens&quot;, or &quot;Gens du voyage&quot; (&quot;travellers&quot;).

There are gay and lesbian communities in the cities, particularly in the Paris metropolitan area (such as in Le Marais district of the capital). Although homosexuality is perhaps not as well tolerated in France as in Spain, Scandinavia, and the Benelux nations, surveys of the French public reveal a considerable shift in attitudes comparable to other Western European nations. , 55% of the French consider homosexuality &quot;an acceptable lifestyle.&quot; The past mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, is gay.
A 2017 Pew Research Center poll found that 73% of French people were in favour of same-sex marriage, while 23% were opposed. The 2019 Eurobarometer found that 79% of French respondents thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 15% were against. Additionally, 85% believed gay, lesbian and bisexual people should enjoy the same rights as heterosexual people. See also LGBT rights in France.

==Families and romantic relationships==
===Household structure===
Growing out of the values of the Catholic Church and rural communities, the basic unit of French society was traditionally held to be the family. Over the twentieth century, the &quot;traditional&quot; family structure in France has evolved from various regional models (including extended families and nuclear families) to, after World War II, nuclear families. Since the 1960s, marriages have decreased and divorces have increased in France, and divorce law and legal family status have evolved to reflect these social changes.

According to INSEE figures, household and family composition in metropolitan France continues to evolve. Most significantly, from 1982 to 1999, single parent families have increased from 3.6% to 7.4%; there have also been increases in the number of unmarried couples, childless couples, and single men (from 8.5% to 12.5) and women (from 16.0% to 18.5%). Their analysis indicates that &quot;one in three dwellings are occupied by a person living alone; one in four dwellings are occupied by a childless couple..&quot;

===Civil unions and same-sex marriages===
Voted by the French Parliament in November 1999 following some controversy, the &quot;pacte civil de solidarité&quot; (&quot;civil pact of solidarity&quot;) commonly known as a &quot;PACS&quot;, is a form of civil union between two adults (same-sex or opposite-sex) for organizing their joint life. It brings rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage. From a legal standpoint, a PACS is a &quot;contract&quot; drawn up between the two individuals, which is stamped and registered by the clerk of the court. Individuals who have registered a PACS are still considered &quot;single&quot; with regard to family status for some purposes, while they are increasingly considered in the same way as married couples are for other purposes. While it was pushed by the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in 1998, it was also opposed, mostly by people on the right-wing who support traditionalist family values and who argued that PACS and the recognition of homosexual unions would be disastrous for French society.

, same-sex marriage is legally recognized in France. Same-sex marriage was an important factor in the presidential election of 2012 between François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy, who represents the right-wing UMP party, opposed gay marriage, while François Hollande, of the left wing socialist party, supported it. Hollande was elected in May 2012 and his government proposed the law known as &quot;Marriage pour tous&quot; (&quot;marriage for all&quot;) to the parliament in November 2012. The law was passed in April 2013 and validated by the Conseil constitutionnel (the constitutional council, tasked with insuring that the new laws passed do not contradict the French constitution) in May 2013. The first French same-sex marriage took place on 29 May 2013 in Montpellier.

==Role of the State==
The French state has traditionally played an important role in promoting and supporting culture through the educational, linguistic, cultural and economic policies of the government and through its promotion of national identity. Because of the closeness of this relationship, cultural changes in France are often linked to, or produce, political crisis.

The relationship between the French state and culture is an old one. Under Louis XIII&#x27;s minister Richelieu, the independent Académie française came under state supervision and became an official organ of control over the French language and seventeenth-century literature. During Louis XIV&#x27;s reign, his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert brought French luxury industries, like textile and porcelain, under royal control and the architecture, furniture, fashion and etiquette of the royal court (particularly at the Château de Versailles) became the preeminent model of noble culture in France (and, to a great degree, throughout Europe) during the latter half of the seventeenth century.

At times, French state policies have sought to unify the country around certain cultural norms, while at other times they have promoted regional differences within a heterogeneous French identity. The unifying effect was particularly true of the &quot;radical period&quot;&quot; of the French Third Republic which fought regionalisms (including regional languages), supported anti-clericalism and a strict separation of church from state (including education) and actively promoted national identity, thus converting (as the historian Eugen Weber has put it) a &quot;country of peasants into a nation of Frenchmen&quot;. The Vichy Regime, on the other hand, promoted regional &quot;folk&quot; traditions.

The cultural policies of the (current) French Fifth Republic have been varied, but a consensus seems to exist around the need for preservation of French regionalisms (such as food and language) as long as these don&#x27;t undermine national identity. Meanwhile, the French state remains ambivalent over the integration into &quot;French&quot; culture of cultural traditions from recent immigrant groups and from foreign cultures, particularly American culture (movies, music, fashion, fast food, language, etc.). There also exists a certain fear over the perceived loss of French identity and culture in the European system and under American &quot;cultural hegemony&quot;.

===Education===
The French educational system is highly centralized. It is divided into three different stages: primary education, or &quot;enseignement primaire, &quot;corresponding to grade school in the United States; secondary education, or &quot;collège&quot; and &quot;lycée, &quot;corresponding to middle and high school in the United States; and higher education (l&#x27;université or &quot;les Grandes écoles&quot;).

Primary and secondary education is predominantly public (private schools also exist, in particular a strong nationwide network of primary and secondary Catholic education), while higher education has both public and private elements. At the end of secondary education, students take the baccalauréat exam, which allows them to pursue higher education. The baccalauréat pass rate in 2012 was 84.5%.

In 1999–2000, educational spending amounted to 7% of the French GDP and 37% of the national budget.

France&#x27;s performance in math and science at the middle school level was ranked 23 in the 1995 Trends in International Math and Science Study. France was ranked 22 in 2019.

Since the Jules Ferry laws of 1881–2, named after the then Minister of Public Instruction, all state-funded schools, including universities, are independent from the (Roman Catholic) Church. Education in these institutions is free. Non-secular institutions are allowed to organize education as well. The French educational system differs strongly from Northern-European and American systems in that it stresses the importance of partaking in a society as opposed to being responsibly independent.

Secular educational policy has become critical in recent issues of French multiculturalism, as in the &quot;affair of the Islamic headscarf&quot;.

===Minister of Culture===

The Minister of Culture is in the Government of France, the cabinet member in charge of national museums and monuments; promoting and protecting the arts (visual, plastic, theatrical, musical, dance, architectural, literary, televisual and cinematographic) in France and abroad; and managing the national archives and regional &quot;maisons de culture&quot; (culture centres). The Ministry of Culture is located on the Palais Royal in Paris.

The modern post of Minister of Culture was created by Charles de Gaulle in 1959 and the first Minister was the writer André Malraux. Malraux was responsible for realizing the goals of the &quot;droit à la culture&quot; (&quot;the right to culture&quot;) – an idea which had been incorporated in the French constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) – by democratizing access to culture, while also achieving the Gaullist aim of elevating the &quot;grandeur&quot; (&quot;greatness&quot;) of post-war France. To this end, he created numerous regional cultural centres throughout France and actively sponsored the arts. Malraux&#x27;s artistic tastes included the modern arts and the avant-garde, but on the whole he remained conservative.

The Ministry of Jacques Toubon was notable for a number of laws (the &quot;Toubon Laws&quot;) enacted for the preservation of the French language, both in advertisements (all ads must include a French translation of foreign words) and on the radio (40% of songs on French radio stations must be in French), ostensibly in reaction to the presence of English.

===Académie Française===

The Académie Française (English: French Academy) is the pre-eminent French learned body on matters pertaining to the French language. The Académie was officially established in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister to King Louis XIII. Suppressed in 1793 during the French Revolution, it was restored in 1803 by Napoleon Bonaparte (the Académie considers itself having been suspended, not suppressed, during the revolution). It is the oldest of the five &quot;académies&quot; of the Institut de France.

The Académie consists of forty members, known as &quot;immortels&quot; (immortals). New members are elected by the members of the Académie itself. Académicians hold office for life, but they may be removed for misconduct. The body has the task of acting as an official authority on the language; it is charged with publishing an official dictionary of the language. Its rulings, however, are only advisory; not binding on either the public or the government.

===Military service===
Until 1996, France had compulsory military service of young men. This has been credited by historians for further promoting a unified national identity and by breaking down regional isolationism.

===Labour and employment policy===
In France, the first labour laws were Waldeck Rousseau&#x27;s laws passed in 1884. Between 1936 and 1938 the Popular Front enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each year of paid vacation for workers, and a law limiting the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The Grenelle accords negotiated on 25 and 26 May in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise. The minimum wage was also increased by 25%. In 2000 Lionel Jospin&#x27;s government then enacted the 35-hour workweek, down from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister Dominique de Villepin enacted the New Employment Contract (CNE). Addressing the demands of employers asking for more flexibility in French labour laws, the CNE sparked criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it was lending favour to contingent work. In 2006 he then attempted to pass the First Employment Contract (CPE) through a vote by emergency procedure, but that it was met by students and unions&#x27; protests. President Jacques Chirac finally had no choice but to repeal it.

===Healthcare and social welfare===
The French are profoundly committed to the public healthcare system (called &quot;sécurité sociale&quot;) and to their &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; social welfare system.

In 1998, 75% of health payments in France were paid through the public healthcare system. Since 27 July 1999, France has a universal medical coverage for permanent residents in France (stable residence for more than three months). Using five performance indicators to measure health systems in 191 member states, it finds that France provides the best overall health care followed among major countries by Italy, Spain, Oman, Austria and Japan (The World Health Report).

==Lifestyle==

===Food and alcohol===
Traditional French culture places a high priority on the enjoyment of food. French cuisine was codified in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier to become the modern version of &quot;haute cuisine&quot;. Escoffier&#x27;s major work, however, left out much of the regional character to be found in the provinces of France. Gastro-tourism and the &quot;Guide Michelin&quot; helped to bring people to the countryside during the 20th century and beyond, to sample this rich &quot;bourgeois&quot; and peasant cuisine of France. Basque cuisine has also been a great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France.

Ingredients and dishes vary by region (see: Regional cuisine). There are many significant regional dishes that have become both national and regional. Many dishes that were once regional, however, have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. Cheese (see: List of French cheeses) and wine (see: French wine) are also a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations and &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws, (lentils from Le Puy-en-Velay also have an AOC status). Another French product of special note is the Charolais cattle.

The French typically eat only a simple breakfast (&quot;petit déjeuner&quot;) which consists of coffee, tea or hot chocolate with milk, served traditionally in a large handleless &quot;bol&quot; (bowl) and bread or breakfast pastries (croissants). Lunch (&quot;déjeuner&quot;) and dinner (&quot;dîner&quot;) are the main meals of the day. Formal four course meals consist of a starter course (&quot;entrée&quot;), a salad, a main course (&quot;plat principal&quot;), and finally a cheese or dessert course. While French cuisine is often associated with rich desserts, in most homes dessert consists of only fruit or yogurt.

Food shopping in France was formerly done almost daily in small local shops and markets, but the arrival of the supermarket and the even larger &quot;hypermarchés&quot; (large-surface distributors) in France have disrupted this tradition. With depopulation of the countryside, many towns have been forced to close shops and markets.

Rates of obesity and heart disease in France have traditionally been lower than in other north-western European countries. This is sometimes called the French paradox (see, for example, Mireille Guiliano&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;French Women Don&#x27;t Get Fat&quot;). French cuisine and eating habits have however come under great pressure in recent years from modern fast food, such as American products and the new global agricultural industry. While French youth culture has gravitated toward fast food and American eating habits (with an attendant rise in obesity), the French in general have remained committed to preserving certain elements of their food culture through such activities as including programs of taste acquisition in their public schools, by the use of the appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée laws, and by state and European subsidies to the French agricultural industry. Emblematic of these tensions is the work of José Bové, who founded in 1987, the &quot;Confédération Paysanne&quot;, an agricultural union that places its highest political values on humans and the environment, promotes organic farming and opposes genetically modified organisms; Bové&#x27;s most famous protest was the dismantling of a McDonald&#x27;s franchise in Millau (Aveyron), in 1999.

In France, cutlery is used in the continental manner (with the fork in the left hand, prongs facing down and the knife in the right hand). French etiquette prohibits the placing of hands below the table and the placing of elbows on it.

The legal drinking age is officially 18 (see: Legal drinking age).

France is one of the oldest wine producing regions of Europe. France now produces the most wine by value in the world (although Italy rivals it by volume and Spain has more land under cultivation for wine grapes). Bordeaux wine, Bourgogne wine and Champagne are important agricultural products.

===Tobacco and drugs===
The cigarette smoking age is 18 years. According to a widespread cliché, smoking has been part of French culture – actually figures indicate that in terms of consumption per capita, France is only the 60th country out of 121.

France, from 1 February 2007, tightened the existing ban on smoking in public places found in the 1991 Évin law: Law n°91-32 of 10 January 1991, containing a variety of measures against alcoholism and tobacco consumption.

Smoking is now banned in all public places (stations, museums, etc.); an exception exists for special smoking rooms fulfilling drastic conditions, see below. A special exemption was made for cafés and restaurants, clubs, casinos, bars, etc. which ended, 1 January 2008. Opinion polls suggest 70% of people support the ban. Previously, under the former implementation rules of the 1991 Évin law, restaurants, cafés etc. just had to provide smoking and non-smoking sections, which in practice were often not well separated.

Under the new regulations, smoking rooms are allowed, but are subjected to very strict conditions: they may occupy at most 20% of the total floor space of the establishment and their size may not be more than 35 m2; they need to be equipped with separate ventilation which replaces the full volume of air ten times per hour; the air pressure of the smoking room must constantly be lower than the pressure in the contiguous rooms; they have doors that close automatically; no service can be provided in the smoking rooms; cleaning and maintenance personnel may enter the room only one hour after it was last used for smoking.

Popular French cigarette brands include Gauloises and Marlboro.

The possession, sale and use of cannabis (predominantly Moroccan hashish) is illegal in France. Since 1 March 1994, the penalties for cannabis use are from two months to a year and/or a fine, while possession, cultivation or trafficking of the drug can be punished much more severely, up to ten years. According to a 1992 survey by SOFRES, 4.7 million French people ages 12–44 have smoked cannabis at least once in their lives.

===Sports and hobbies===


France hosts &quot;the world&#x27;s biggest annual sporting event&quot;, the annual cycling race Tour de France. Other popular sports played in France include: football, judo, tennis, rugby union and pétanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations&#x27; Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France&#x27;s largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1923, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race. Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing.

France has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games&#x27; revival, at the end of the 19th century. After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics&#x27; Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900 (see: France at the Olympics). Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne. Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 5 further occasions: the 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics, both in Paris and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville). Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924 with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic, Eugène Rubens-Alcais who paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of the Summer Deaflympics in Paris.

Both the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed &quot;Les Bleus&quot; in reference to the team&#x27;s shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players and over 18,000 registered clubs. While football is the most popular, rugby union and rugby league takes dominance in the southwest, especially around the city of Toulouse (see: Rugby union in France and Rugby league in France). The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup; it takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship.

The French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.

Professional sailing in France is centred on singlehanded and shorthanded ocean racing with the pinnacle of this branch of the sport being the Vendée Globe singlehanded around the world race which starts every four years from the French Atlantic coast. Other significant events include the Solitaire du Figaro, Mini Transat 6.50, Tour Voile and Route du Rhum transatlantic race. France has been a regular competitor in the America&#x27;s Cup since the 1970s.

Other important sports include:
* Skiing – France has an extensive number of ski resorts in the French alps such as Tignes. Ski resorts are also located in the Pyrénées and Vosges mountain chains.
* Parkour – Developed in France, Parkour is a training discipline with similarities to self-defense or martial arts.
* Babyfoot (table football) – A very popular pastime in bars and homes in France, and the French are the predominant winners of worldwide table football competitions.
* Kitesurfing
* Bullfighting – Spanish style bullfighting is still popular in the southern part of France.

Like other cultural areas in France, sport is overseen by a government ministry, the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, which is in charge of national and public sport associations, youth affairs, public sports centers and national stadia (like the Stade de France). Sport is encouraged in school, and local sports clubs receive financial support from the local governments.

===Fashion===

Along with Milan, London and New York, Paris is center of an important number of fashion shows. Some of the world&#x27;s biggest fashion houses (e.g. Chanel) have their headquarters in France.

The association of France with fashion () dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. France renewed its dominance of the high fashion ( or ) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses, the fashion press (&quot;Vogue&quot; was founded in 1892; &quot;Elle&quot; was founded in 1945) and fashion shows. The first modern Parisian couturier house is generally considered the work of the Englishman Charles Frederick Worth who dominated the industry from 1858 to 1895. In the early twentieth century, the industry expanded through such Parisian fashion houses as the house of Chanel (which first came to prominence in 1925) and Balenciaga (founded by a Spaniard in 1937). In the post-war years, fashion returned to prominence through Christian Dior&#x27;s famous &quot;new look&quot; in 1947, and through the houses of Pierre Balmain and Hubert de Givenchy (opened in 1952). In the 1960s, &quot;high fashion&quot; came under criticism from France&#x27;s youth culture while designers like Yves Saint Laurent broke with established high fashion norms by launching &quot;prêt-à-porter&quot; (&quot;ready to wear&quot;) lines and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing and marketing. Further innovations were carried out by Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established in the 1970s and 1980s by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH.

Since the 1960s, France&#x27;s fashion industry has come under increasing competition from London, New York, Milan and Tokyo, and the French have increasingly adopted foreign (particularly American) fashions (such as jeans, tennis shoes). Nevertheless, many foreign designers still seek to make their careers in France.

===Pets===

In 2006, 52% of French households had at least one pet: In total, 9.7 million cats, 8.8 million dogs, 2.3 million rodents, 8 million birds, and 28 million fish were kept as pets in France during this year.

==Media and art==

===Art and museums===

The first paintings of France are those that are from prehistoric times, painted in the caves of Lascaux well over 10,000 years ago. The arts were already flourishing 1,200 years ago, at the time of Charlemagne, as can be seen in many hand made and hand illustrated books of that time.

Gothic art and architecture originated in France in the 12th century around Paris and then spread to all of Europe. In the 13th century, French craftsmen developed the stained glass painting technique and sophisticated illuminated manuscripts for private devotion in the new gothic style. The final phase of gothic architecture, known as Flamboyant, also began in France in the 15th century before spreading to the rest of Europe.

The 17th century was one of intense artistic achievements: French painting emerged with a distinct identity, moving from Baroque to Classicism. Famous classic painters of the 17th century in France are Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. French architecture also proved influential with the Palace of Versailles, built for the powerful king Louis XIV, becoming the model of many European royal palaces. During the 18th century the Rococo style emerged as a frivolous continuation of the Baroque style. The most famous painters of the era were Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. At the end of the century, Jacques-Louis David and Dominique Ingres were the most influential painters of the Neoclassicism.

Géricault and Delacroix were the most important painters of the Romanticism. Afterwards, the painters were more realistic, describing nature (Barbizon school). The realistic movement was led by Courbet and Honoré Daumier. Impressionism was developed in France by artists such as Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Camille Pissarro. At the turn of the century, France had become more than ever the center of innovative art. The Spaniard Pablo Picasso came to France, like many other foreign artists, to deploy his talents there for decades to come. Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Cézanne were painting then. Cubism is an avant-garde movement born in Paris at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Louvre in Paris is one of the most famous and the largest art museums in the world, created by the new revolutionary regime in 1793 in the former royal palace. It holds a vast amount of art of French and other artists, e.g. the Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, and classical Greek Venus de Milo and ancient works of culture and art from Egypt and the Middle East.

===Music===
France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the &quot;Roi Soleil&quot;, French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer of the harpsichord.

In the field of classical music, France has produced a number of notable composers such as Gabriel Fauré, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Hector Berlioz. Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. The two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. His music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. Ravel&#x27;s piano compositions, such as &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot;, &quot;Miroirs&quot;, &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot; and &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot;, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot;, &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; and his orchestral work &quot;Boléro&quot; (1928). Erik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde. Francis Poulenc&#x27;s best-known works are his piano suite &quot;Trois mouvements perpétuels&quot; (1919), the ballet &quot;Les biches&quot; (1923), the &quot;Concert champêtre&quot; (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; (1957) and the &quot;Gloria&quot; (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. More recently, in the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolution of contemporary classical music.

French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as &quot;chanson française&quot;, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg. Modern pop music has seen the rise of popular French hip hop, French rock, techno/funk, and turntablists/DJs. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries, bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira, or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity.

The Fête de la Musique was created in France (first held in 1982), a music festival, which has since become celebrated worldwide as world music day. It takes place every 21 June, on the first day of summer.

===Theater===
===Cinema===

France has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895. The world&#x27;s first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France. Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the Government of France. Philippe Binant realized, on 2 February 2000, the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.

France remains a leader in filmmaking, producing more films than any other European country. The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world. Additionally, France is an important Francophone film production country. A certain amount of the movies created share international distribution in the western hemisphere thanks to Unifrance. Although French cinema industry is rather small in terms of budget and revenues, it enjoys qualitative screenplay, cast and story telling. French cinema is often portrayed as more liberal in terms of subjects (e.g. sex, society, politics, historical, etc.).

Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan. French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK. In 2013 France was the second greatest exporter of films in the world, after the United States.

French major cinema operators are UGC and Pathé, mainly located in city suburbs due to the number of screens and seating capacity. Many &quot;small&quot; cinemas are located in the downtown parts of a city, resisting the big cinema operators nationwide. Paris has the highest density of cinemas in the world, and in most downtown Paris cinemas, foreign movies, which would be secluded to &quot;art houses&quot; cinemas in other places, are shown alongside &quot;mainstream&quot; works. The Cinémathèque Française holds one of the largest archives of films, movie documents and film-related objects in the world. Located in Paris, the Cinémathèque holds daily screenings of films unrestricted by country of origin.

As part of its advocacy of cultural exception, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products, France succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993. Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a vote by UNESCO in 2005: the principle of &quot;cultural exception&quot; won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against it.

===Television===

Just like many other European countries, France has public and private television channels. The public broadcasting corporation France Télévisions comprises the channels France 2, France 3, France 4, France 5 and France Info.

France Télévisions is also a shareholder of TV5Monde, Arte and the multilingual pan-European news channel Euronews. TV5Monde is a French-language common channel of France, Belgium and the French-speaking areas of Canada and Switzerland and, after the BBC, CNN and MIV, the fourth largest television network in the world. Arte is a German-French channel controlled by Arte France together with the German public broadcasting corporations ARD and ZDF.

The private broadcasting corporation TF1 is the largest television channel in France. TF1 was public until 1987. The corporation also controls the sports channel Eurosport. Other major private channels include M6 and Canal +.

BFM TV is an independent private news channel, which is also broadcast on the Internet – just like the French and English language news channel France 24, which has been broadcasting since December 2006 and is controlled by TF1 and France Télévisions.

===Books, newspapers and magazines===

France has the reputation of being a &quot;literary culture&quot;, and this image is reinforced by such things as the importance of French literature in the French educational system, the attention paid by the French media to French book fairs and book prizes (like the Prix Goncourt, Prix Renaudot or Prix Femina) and by the popular success of the (former) literary television show &quot;Apostrophes&quot; (hosted by Bernard Pivot).

Although the official literacy rate of France is 99%, some estimates have placed functional illiteracy at between 10% and 20% of the adult population (and higher in the prison population).

While reading remains a favorite pastime of French youth today, surveys show that it has decreased in importance compared to music, television, sports and other activities. The crisis of academic publishing has also hit France (see, for example, the financial difficulties of the Presses universitaires de France (PUF), France&#x27;s premier academic publishing house, in the 1990s).

Literary taste in France remains centered on the novel (26.4% of book sales in 1997), although the French read more non-fiction essays and books on current affairs than the British or Americans. Contemporary novels, including French translations of foreign novels, lead the list (13% of total books sold), followed by sentimental novels (4.1%), detective and spy fiction (3.7%), &quot;classic&quot; literature (3.5%), science fiction and horror (1.3%) and erotic fiction (0.2%). About 30% of all fiction sold in France today is translated from English (authors such as William Boyd, John le Carré, Ian McEwan, Paul Auster and Douglas Kennedy are well received).

An important subset of book sales is comic books (typically Franco-Belgian comics like &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and &quot;Astérix&quot;) which are published in a large hardback format; comic books represented 4% of total book sales in 1997. French artists have made the country a leader in the graphic novel genre and France hosts the Angoulême International Comics Festival, Europe&#x27;s preeminent comics festival.

Like other areas of French culture, book culture is influenced, in part, by the state, in particular by the &quot;Direction du livre et de la lecture&quot; of the Ministry of Culture, which oversees the &quot;Centre national du livre&quot; (National Book Center). The French Ministry of Industry also plays a role in price control. Finally, the VAT for books and other cultural products in France is at the reduced rate of 5.5%, which is also that of food and other necessities (see here).

In terms of journalism in France, the regional press (see list of newspapers in France) has become more important than national dailies (such as &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot;) over the past century: in 1939, national dailies were 2/3 of the dailies market, while today they are less than 1/4. The magazine market is currently dominated by TV listings magazines followed by news magazines such as &quot;L&#x27;Obs&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; and &quot;Le Point&quot;.

==Architecture and housing==


During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d&#x27;Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe.

Gothic architecture, originally named &quot;Opus Francigenum&quot; meaning &quot;French work&quot;, was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be imitated throughout Europe. Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d&#x27;Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.

The final victory in the Hundred Years&#x27; War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 as a first reference the Château de Montsoreau. Examples of such residential castles include the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d&#x27;Amboise.

Following the Renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, Baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one. In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many Baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architects of the Baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides. Some of the most impressive provincial Baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.

After the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France before the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire-style architecture. Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-Baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; most notably, Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris. The architecture associated with this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as the Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the Eiffel Tower.

In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under . France&#x27;s largest financial district is La Défense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located. Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc and Paul Andreu.

==Transportation==
There are significant differences in lifestyles with respect to transportation between very urbanized regions such as Paris, and smaller towns and rural areas. In Paris, and to a lesser extent in other major cities, many households do not own an automobile and simply use efficient public transport. The cliché about the Parisien is rush hour in the &quot;Métro&quot; subway. However, outside of such areas, ownership of one or more cars is standard, especially for households with children.

=== Odonymy ===

France has a number of traditional road naming conventions.

==Holidays==

Despite the principles of &quot;laïcité&quot; and the separation of church from state, public and school holidays in France generally follow the Roman Catholic religious calendar (including Easter, Christmas, Ascension Day, Pentecost, Assumption of Mary, All Saints Day, etc.). Labor Day and the National Holiday are the only business holidays determined by government statute; the other holidays are granted by &quot;convention collective&quot; (agreement between employers&#x27; and employees&#x27; unions) or by agreement of the employer.

The five holiday periods of the public school year are:
* the &quot;vacances de la Toussaint&quot; (All Saints Day) – two weeks starting near the end of October.
* the &quot;vacances de Noël&quot; (Christmas) – two weeks, ending after New Years.
* the &quot;vacances d&#x27;hiver&quot; (winter) – two weeks in February and March.
* the &quot;vacances de printemps&quot; (spring), formerly &quot;vacances de Pâques&quot; (Easter) – two weeks in April and May.
* the &quot;vacances d&#x27;été&quot; (summer), or &quot;grandes vacances&quot; (literally: big holidays) – two months in July and August.

On 1 May, Labour Day (&quot;La Fête du Travail&quot;) the French give flowers of Lily of the Valley (Le Muguet) to one another.

The National holiday (called Bastille Day in English) is on 14 July. Military parades, called Défilés du 14 juillet, are held, the largest on the Champs-Élysées avenue in Paris in front of the President of the Republic.

On 2 November, All Souls Day (&quot;La Fête des morts&quot;), the French traditionally bring chrysanthemums to the tombs of departed family members.

On 11 November, Remembrance Day (&quot;Le Jour de la Commémoration&quot; or &quot;L&#x27; Armistice&quot;) is an official holiday.

Christmas is generally celebrated in France on Christmas Eve by a traditional meal (typical dishes include oysters, boudin blanc and the bûche de Noël), by opening presents and by attending the midnight mass (even among Catholics who do not attend church at other times of the year).

Candlemas (&quot;La Chandeleur&quot;) is celebrated with crêpes. The popular saying is that if the cook can flip a crêpe singlehandedly with a coin in the other hand, the family is assured of prosperity throughout the coming year.

The Celtic holiday Halloween, which is popular throughout the English-speaking world, has grown in popularity following its introduction in the mid-1990s by the trade associations. The growth seems to have stalled during the following decade.

==Conventions==
* France is the home of the International System of Units (the metric system). Some pre-metric units are still used, essentially the &quot;livre&quot; (a unit of weight equal to half a kilogram) and the &quot;quintal&quot; (a unit of weight equal to 100 kilograms).
* In mathematics, France uses the infix notation like most countries. For large numbers the long scale is used. Thus, the French use the word &quot;billion&quot; for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using short scale is called a trillion. However, there exists a French word, &quot;milliard&quot;, for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite the use of the long scale, one billion is called &quot;un milliard&quot; (&quot;one milliard&quot;) in French, and not &quot;mille millions&quot; (&quot;one thousand million&quot;). It should also be noted that names of numbers above the &quot;milliard&quot; are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called &quot;mille milliards&quot; (&quot;one thousand milliard&quot;) in French, and rarely &quot;un billion&quot;.
* In the French numeral notation, the comma (,) is the decimal separator, whereas a space is used between each group of three digits (fifteen million five hundred thousand and thirty-two should be written as 15 500 032). In finance, the currency symbol is used as a decimal separator or put after the number. For example, €25,048.05 is written either 25 048€05 or €25 048,05 (always with an extra space between the figure and the currency symbol).
* In computing, a bit is called a bit yet a byte is called an octet (from the Latin root &quot;octo&quot;, meaning &quot;8&quot;). SI prefixes are used.
* 24-hour clock time is used, with h being the separator between hours and minutes (for example 2:30 pm is 14h30).
* The all-numeric form for dates is in the order day-month-year, using a slash as the separator (example: 31 December 1992 or 31/12/92).

==Problem in defining &quot;French&quot; culture==
Wherever one comes from, &quot;culture&quot; consists of beliefs and values learned through the socialization process as well as material artifacts. &quot;Culture is the learned set of beliefs, values, norms and material goods shared by group members. Culture consists of everything we learn in groups during the life course-from infancy to an old age.&quot;

The conception of &quot;French&quot; culture however poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what precisely the expression &quot;French&quot; means. Whereas American culture posits the notion of the &quot;melting-pot&quot; and cultural diversity, the expression &quot;French culture&quot; tends to refer implicitly to a specific geographical entity (as, say, &quot;metropolitan France&quot;, generally excluding its overseas departments) or to a specific historico-sociological group defined by ethnicity, language, religion and geography. The realities of &quot;Frenchness&quot; however, are extremely complicated. Even before the late 18th–19th century, &quot;metropolitan France&quot; was largely a patchwork of local customs and regional differences that the unifying aims of the Ancien Régime and the French Revolution had only begun to work against, and today&#x27;s France remains a nation of numerous indigenous and foreign languages, of multiple ethnicities and religions, and of regional diversity that includes French citizens in Corsica, Guadeloupe, Martinique and elsewhere around the globe also in America.

The creation of some sort of typical or shared French culture or &quot;cultural identity&quot;, despite this vast heterogeneity, is the result of powerful internal forces – such as the French educational system, mandatory military service, state linguistic and cultural policies – and by profound historic events – such as the Franco-Prussian war and the two World Wars — which have forged a sense of national identity over the last 200 years. However, despite these unifying forces, France today still remains marked by social class and by important regional differences in culture (cuisine, dialect/accent, local traditions) that many fear will be unable to withstand contemporary social forces (depopulation of the countryside, immigration, centralization, market forces and the world economy).

In recent years, to fight the loss of regional diversity, many in France have promoted forms of multiculturalism and encouraged cultural enclaves (&quot;communautarisme&quot;), including reforms on the preservation of regional languages and the decentralization of certain government functions, but French multiculturalism has had a harder time of accepting, or of integrating into the collective identity, the large non-Christian and immigrant communities and groups that have come to France since the 1960s.

The last 70 years has also seen French cultural identity &quot;threatened&quot; by global market forces and by American &quot;cultural hegemony&quot;. Since its dealings with the 1943 GATT free trade negotiations, France has fought for what it calls the &quot;exception culturelle&quot;, meaning the right to subsidize or treat favorably domestic cultural production and to limit or control foreign cultural products (as seen in public funding for French cinema or the lower VAT accorded to books). The notion of an explicit &quot;exception française&quot; however has angered many of France&#x27;s critics.

The French are often perceived as taking a great pride in national identity and the positive achievements of France (the expression &quot;chauvinism&quot; is of French origin) and cultural issues are more integrated in the body of the politics than elsewhere (see &quot;The Role of the State&quot;, above). The French Revolution claimed universalism for the democratic principles of the Republic. Charles de Gaulle actively promoted a notion of French &quot;grandeur&quot; (&quot;greatness&quot;). Perceived declines in cultural status are a matter of national concern and have generated national debates, both from the left (as seen in the anti-globalism of José Bové) and from the right and far right (as in the discourses of the National Front).

According to Hofstede&#x27;s Framework for Assessing Culture, the culture of France is moderately individualistic and high Power Distance Index.

Now, the interracial blending of some native French and newcomers stands as a vibrant and boasted feature of French culture, from popular music to movies and literature. Therefore, alongside mixing of populations, exists also a cultural blending (&quot;le métissage culturel&quot;) that is present in France. It may be compared to the traditional US conception of the melting-pot. The French culture might have been already blended in from other races and ethnicities, in cases of some biographical research on the possibility of African ancestry on a small number of famous French citizens. Author Alexandre Dumas, père possessed one-fifth black Haitian descent, and Empress Josephine Napoleon who was born and raised in the French West Indies from a plantation estate family.
We can mention as well, the most famous French-Canadian singer Celine Dion whose grandmother was a North African from Kabylie.

For a long time, the only objection to such outcomes predictably came from the far-left schools of thought. In the past few years, other unexpected voices are however beginning to question what they interpret, as the new philosopher Alain Finkielkraut coined the term, as an &quot;Ideology of miscegenation&quot; (&quot;une idéologie du métissage&quot;) that may come from what one other philosopher, Pascal Bruckner, defined as &quot;The Tears of the White Man&quot; (&quot;le sanglot de l&#x27;homme blanc&quot;). These critics have been dismissed by the mainstream and their propagators have been labelled as new reactionaries (&quot;les nouveaux réactionnaires&quot;), even if racist and anti-immigration sentiment has recently been documented to be increasing in France at least according to one poll.

== Cultural imperialism ==

French culture, language, and education have been mobilized to further French imperial interests. The concept of or &#x27;civilizing mission&#x27; figured into France&#x27;s throughout its colonies, with its goal fluctuating between assimilation and of colonial subjects with French culture.

Aspects of French cultural imperialism—as embodied in the or —have endured beyond the decolonization period.

Transformations in French ethnographic museums since the early 2000s have provoked criticisms of their alleged political role: reconciling increasing ethnic diversity among the nation&#x27;s population within its republican model of assimilation, and even homogeneity. The criticisms have also included allegations of an erasure of France&#x27;s colonial past as well as an erasure of the history of the collections.

== Culture of Overseas France ==
Culture within European France and Overseas France differs. Overseas France consists of 13 French-administered territories outside Europe, mostly the remains of the French colonial empire that remained a part of the French state under various statuses after decolonization. Overseas French cultures include the cultures of Martinique and Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, the Culture of French Guiana in South America, the blend of European, African, Indian, Chinese and insular traditions in Reunion, the Polynesian cultures of French Polynesia, and the mix of indigenous Kanak, European, and Polynesian cultures of New Caledonia.

<text>Thierry la Fronde (&quot;Terry the Sling&quot;) was a French television series that aired from 1963 to 1966 on the television station, ORTF. The original script was by Jean-Claude Deret.

Dubbed into English, the series was shown internationally in the 1960s, including Canada and Australia, where it was referred to under the original name, and also as &quot;The King&#x27;s Outlaw&quot;. It was shown as well in Poland as &quot;Thierry Śmiałek&quot; (Thierry the Daredevil). On ABC in Australia, it was called &quot;The King&#x27;s Outlaw&quot;. In the Netherlands, 32 of the 52 episodes were shown in 1967 as &quot;Thierry de Slingeraar&quot; (Thierry the Sling), as a Netherlands Television Service programme.

==Synopsis==
In 1356, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, France is occupied by the English, and the Black Prince rules France with an iron fist. In Sologne in the heart of France, Thierry of Janville, a young lord, fights gallantly against the English occupation but is betrayed by his steward, Florent, and loses his title and his lands. He then takes the name of &quot;Thierry La Fronde&quot;, and with the help of his faithful companions continues his fight undercover.

This preceded each episode on the Australian version.
Early in the 14th century France and England were locked in a long war.
The French King had been captured by the Prince of Wales The black prince
and the Dauphin Charles leading the French fought on against the English on one side and his rebel cousin Charles of Navarre on the other
During the sojourn The Loyal duke of jombere was forced to become an outlaw
With his favorite weapon the fronde or sling
he became the legendary hero
Thierry La Fronde
The kings outlaw

==Production==

The programme theme music was a simple tune in the Dorian mode composed by Jacques Loussier, and performed on a brass instrument (possibly a French horn) for the melody.

A co-production of Téléfrance and RTF, 52 episodes of 26 minutes each were produced in black and white (November 1963 to March 1966), and first broadcast in 1963.

==Reception==

The series was created to compete with the overwhelming British and U.S. film productions with mediaeval themes and became one of the most popular programmes on French television in the 1960s. It is credited with boosting the use of the sling shot in French school playgrounds and turning the relatively rare first name, Thierry, into one of the most popular names for French boys.

In 1964 Lucien Nortier drew a comic strip adaptation, published in &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot;. In October 2012, it was announced that a modern version of the programme was in production.

<doc id="98991" wikidata="Q40187" url="?curid=98991" title="Dogma (film)">
<text>Dogma is a 1999 American fantasy comedy film written and directed by Kevin Smith, who also stars with Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, George Carlin, Linda Fiorentino, Janeane Garofalo, Chris Rock, Jason Lee, Salma Hayek, Bud Cort, Alan Rickman, Alanis Morissette in her feature film debut, and Jason Mewes. It is the fourth film in Smith&#x27;s View Askewniverse series. Brian O&#x27;Halloran and Jeff Anderson, stars of the first Askewniverse film &quot;Clerks&quot;, appear in the film, as do Smith regulars Scott Mosier, Dwight Ewell, Walt Flanagan, and Bryan Johnson.

The story revolves around two fallen angels who plan to employ an alleged loophole in Catholic dogma to return to Heaven after being cast out by God, but as existence is founded on the principle that God is infallible, their success would prove God wrong, thus undoing all creation. The last scion and two prophets are sent by the seraph Metatron to stop them.

The film&#x27;s irreverent treatment of Catholicism and the Catholic Church triggered considerable controversy, even before its opening. The Catholic League denounced it as blasphemy. Organized protests delayed its release in many countries and led to at least two death threats against Smith. Despite this, &quot;Dogma&quot; was well received by critics, and grossed $43 million against its $10 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing film in the View Askewniverse series to date.

==Plot==

Bartleby and Loki are fallen angels, eternally banished from Heaven to Wisconsin for insubordination, after an inebriated Loki resigned as the Angel of Death at Bartleby&#x27;s suggestion. In a newspaper article that arrives anonymously, the angels discover a way home: Cardinal Ignatius Glick is rededicating his church in Red Bank, New Jersey, in the image of the &quot;Buddy Christ.&quot; Anyone who enters the church during the rededication festivities will receive a plenary indulgence, remitting all sins. Were the banished angels to undergo this rite—and then die after transmuting into human form—God would have no choice but to allow them re-entry into Heaven. They are encouraged by the demon Azrael and the Stygian triplets, three teenage hoodlums who serve Azrael in hell.

Bethany Sloane, a despondent abortion clinic counselor, attends a service at her church in McHenry, Illinois. Donations are solicited for a campaign to stop a Red Bank hospital from disconnecting life support on John Doe Jersey, a homeless man who was beaten into a coma by the triplets. Metatron—a seraph, and the voice of God—appears to Bethany in a pillar of fire and explains that if Bartleby and Loki succeed in re-entering Heaven, they will overrule the word of God, disprove the fundamental concept of God&#x27;s omnipotence, and nullify all of existence. Bethany, aided by two prophets, must stop the angels and save the universe.

Now a target, Bethany is attacked by the triplets, who are driven off by the two foretold prophets, drug-dealing stoners Jay and Silent Bob. Bethany and the prophets are joined by Rufus, the 13th apostle, and Serendipity, the Muse of creative inspiration, who now works at a strip club in search of inspiration of her own. Azrael summons the Golgothan, a vile creature made of human excrement, but Bob immobilizes it with aerosol air freshener.

On a train to Red Bank, a drunken Bethany reveals her mission to Bartleby, who tries to kill her; Bob throws the angels off the train. Bartleby and Loki now realize the consequences of their scheme; Loki wants no part of destroying all existence, but Bartleby remains angry at God for his expulsion, and for granting free will to humans while demanding servitude from angels, and resolves to proceed.

In Red Bank, Bethany asks why she has been called upon to save the universe; why can&#x27;t God simply do it himself? Metatron admits that God&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown; he disappeared while visiting New Jersey in human form to play skee ball. The task falls to Bethany because—she now learns—she is the last scion, a distant but direct blood relative of Jesus.

The group cannot persuade Glick to cancel the celebration. Jay steals one of Glick&#x27;s golf clubs. Their only remaining option is to keep the angels out of the church, but Azrael and the triplets trap them in a bar to prevent them from doing so. Azrael reveals that he sent the news clipping to the angels; he would rather end all existence than spend eternity in Hell. Bob kills Azrael with the golf club, which Glick had blessed to improve his game. Bethany blesses the bar sink&#x27;s contents, and the others drown the triplets in the holy water. They race to the church, where Bartleby has killed Glick, his parishioners, and assorted bystanders. When Loki (who is now wingless and therefore mortal, with a conscience) attempts to stop him, Bartleby kills him as well.

All appears lost; Jay attempts to seduce Bethany before all existence ends. When he mentions John Doe Jersey, Bethany finally puts all the clues together. She and Bob race across the street to the hospital, as the others try to keep Bartleby from entering the church. But in doing so, Jay destroys his wings with automatic gunfire, making him mortal as well. Her faith restored, Bethany disconnects John&#x27;s life support, liberating God, but killing herself. Bartleby reaches the church entrance where he confronts God, manifested in female form, who annihilates him with her voice. Bob arrives with Bethany&#x27;s lifeless body; God resurrects her and conceives a child—the new last scion—within her womb. God, Metatron, Rufus, and Serendipity return to Heaven, leaving Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob to reflect on the past and the future.

==Production==
===Development===
On October 25, 2000, Kevin Smith wrote an essay titled &quot;In the Beginning... The Story of Dogma&quot;, which details the history and genesis of how &quot;Dogma&quot; came to be. His essay is available on the &quot;Dogma&quot; 2-disc Special Edition DVD.

Before Smith began writing &quot;Clerks&quot;, he began noting down ideas for a film called &quot;God&quot;. During his brief period in film school, he essentially wrote the scene introducing Rufus, but this version did not feature Jay and Silent Bob. During the development of &quot;Clerks&quot;, Smith continued to jot down ideas for his &quot;God&quot; project, including having the main character be a high school jock, the conception of 13th Apostle, Rufus, and a muse named Serendipity; but, Smith didn&#x27;t have a story to work off of.

By the time &quot;Clerks&quot; had been picked up for distribution, Smith began writing the first draft for the film. He felt calling the project &quot;God&quot; was inappropriate, and retitled it &quot;Dogma&quot;. The first draft was completed in August 1994, with 148 pages accomplished, and more additions; the high school protagonist was changed to a stripper named Bethany who meets Jay and Silent Bob at a nudie booth, Azrael (or known throughout the script as the &quot;Shadowy Figure&quot;) was introduced in the final 30 pages, and Bethany blew up the church in order to not let Bartleby and Loki pass through the archway. After Smith and &quot;Clerks&quot; producer Scott Mosier reread the draft, they decided that they didn&#x27;t want &quot;Dogma&quot; to be their sophomore film; they didn&#x27;t want to tackle a bigger scale picture until they felt ready to do it. Despite including the line &quot;Jay and Silent Bob will return in &quot;Dogma&quot;&quot; at the end of &quot;Clerks&quot;, Smith moved to Universal Studios in order to develop his next film, &quot;Mallrats&quot;.

During &quot;Mallrats″&quot; production, Smith revisited the &quot;Dogma&quot; script and made some changes; Bethany&#x27;s job went from stripper to an abortion clinic and included an orangutan for Jay and Silent Bob to hang out with. In 1996, he dropped the orangutan and reworked Bethany to be played by his then-girlfriend Joey Lauren Adams. During that time, he was writing &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and got Ben Affleck to agree to be in both projects. After &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; was released to critical and box-office success, Smith felt confident enough to make &quot;Dogma&quot;.

===Visual effects===
Smith and Mosier assembled a group of visual artists to realize their concept of a surreal, abstract environment &quot;somewhere between reality and unreality&quot;: production designer Robert Holtzman, special effects supervisor Charles Belardinelli, creature effects supervisor Vincent Guastini, costume designer Abigail Murray, and director of photography Robert Yeoman.

===Locations===

Principal filming took place from March to June 1998. The triplets&#x27; attack on John Doe Jersey was filmed on the boardwalk in Asbury Park, New Jersey; all other scenes were shot in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Mexican restaurant in which Metatron explains Bethany&#x27;s mission was the Franklin Inn in Franklin Park, north of Pittsburgh. Serendipity&#x27;s pole dance and the Golgothan confrontation took place at the Park View Cafe (since renamed Crazy Mocha and later Yinz Coffee) on East North Avenue in Pittsburgh. The heroes plan their final strategy in the Grand Concourse Restaurant in the restored Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Station. St Michael&#x27;s Church, site of the apocalyptic climax, is the Saints Peter and Paul Church—currently vacant—in East Liberty.

===Casting===

Jason Lee was initially attached to play Loki. When that role went to Matt Damon, due to his onscreen chemistry with Affleck in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, Lee received the Azrael role due to scheduling conflicts with filming &quot;Mumford&quot;. Smith envisioned Samuel L. Jackson as Rufus, but was convinced to hire Chris Rock after meeting him. Alan Rickman was recruited to play Metatron. Albert Brooks was offered the role of Cardinal Glick, but turned it down. Emma Thompson was originally attached to play God, but had to withdraw when she became pregnant. Smith — a fan of &quot;The X-Files&quot; — offered the role of Bethany to Gillian Anderson, but &quot;heard back that she really hated it.&quot;

Critics expressed surprise at the film&#x27;s eclectic casting, which Smith said was done deliberately to emphasize contrasts between characters — Rickman as the powerful Metatron, for example, opposite Mewes as the hopelessly verbose stoner Jay, &quot;...a Shakespearean trained actor of the highest order next to a dude from New Jersey.&quot; Smith warned Mewes that he would have to take his acting to a higher level. &quot;I really impressed upon him that he had to be prepared for this movie. &#x27;There are real actors in this one,&#x27; we kept telling him.&quot; In response, Mewes memorized not only his own dialogue but the entire screenplay, because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to piss off that Rickman dude&quot;.

Other unorthodox casting decisions included George Carlin, who had made his atheism a cornerstone of his public image, as a Catholic priest; Mexican actress Salma Hayek as Serendipity — &quot;the [Muse] who throughout history inspired all the geniuses of art and music, like Mozart and Michelangelo, and never got any of the credit&quot; — and singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette as God. &quot;There&#x27;s a Zen Buddhist serenity to Alanis that calls to mind something otherworldly,&quot; Smith explained. &quot;She&#x27;s definitely ethereal in nature, even when not speaking, and she carries an air about her that played into the role.&quot;

It was rumored in the years following the film’s release that Fiorentino and Smith did not get along during the filming. Smith stated that rumors of a falling out between the two had been misconstrued and overstated, and that while the two hadn’t spoken in years, they amicably reconnected following his near fatal heart attack. He attributed the rumors to a careless comment: “ I remember on a commentary track on the DVD — Janeane Garofalo was in the movie and at one point I said it would have better if she played the lead, which was a really shitty and stupid thing to say. Thoughtless, considering that Linda was the lead and Linda did a great job. So it had been years since I had spoken with Linda and I got an email from her. And of course I was thankful to hear from her and it also gave me a chance to say I’m so sorry that I ever said that thing years ago. It gives you a chance to make amends. So that was my favorite one. I heard from so many people, but that one really stood out for me because, if somebody had said, ‘Oh, the movie would have been better if Ben Affleck directed it,’ that would have hurt my feelings. I know it hurt her feelings and really unnecessarily because I always loved her performance in the movie.”

===Deleted scenes===
On the film&#x27;s official website, Smith described a scene that did not make the final cut: a climactic face-off in the hospital between Silent Bob, a badly burned and half-decomposed triplet, and the Golgothan. The battle was to end with the triplet killing Bethany (temporarily), and God, newly liberated, transforming the Golgothan into flowers. Test audiences felt the scene had &quot;too much Golgothan&quot;, and the film&#x27;s run time already exceeded two hours, so the scene was eliminated.

Another deleted scene has come to be known as the &quot;&quot;Fat Albert&quot; sequence&quot;. In the strip club, a gang (led by Dwight Ewell) grows jealous that the stripper is paying more attention to Jay &amp; Silent Bob than to them. The gang confronts them and draws guns. Jay &amp; Silent Bob then defuse the situation by taking to the stage and performing the theme song from &quot;Fat Albert.&quot; Rufus realizes that the stripper is the muse Serendipity, and she actually deescalated things by giving Jay &amp; Silent Bob the idea. The sequence was in the film when it screened at Cannes, but was removed before its general release. The scene gained notoriety as fans began speculating as to why it was removed. On the &quot;Dogma: Special Edition&quot; DVD, Smith said the feedback he received was that the scene ran too long and was not very funny.

==Release==
&quot;Dogma&quot; was originally scheduled for a November 1998 release by Miramax Films, but due to controversy, the film was postponed for a 1999 release, and the rights were passed on to Lions Gate Films for the United States, although Miramax Films retained foreign distribution rights.

The film was screened but was not entered into competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.

===Home media===
&quot;Dogma&quot; was released on DVD and VHS by Columbia TriStar Home Video in May 2000. This was followed by a 2-disc Special Edition DVD in 2001 and then on Blu-ray in 2008. A thirty-seven minute documentary produced for the DVD, &quot;Judge Not: In Defense of Dogma&quot;, was not completed in time for the release and was instead included on the DVD release for the Smith-produced film &quot;Vulgar&quot;.

===Rights issues===
After going out of print on home media, &quot;Dogma&quot; was unavailable to stream or purchase digitally due to the film&#x27;s rights being owned personally by Bob and Harvey Weinstein in a deal that predated the streaming era. In early 2020, after Harvey was convicted and sentenced to 23 years&#x27; incarceration for rape, he reportedly contacted Bob offering to sell the rights for $5 million, but Bob refused. In 2022, while promoting the release of &quot;Clerks III&quot;, Kevin Smith publicly commented on his efforts to reacquire rights to the film, claiming he had made two offers that were turned down, and quipping, &quot;My movie about angels is owned by the devil himself.&quot;

In June 2024, at a Smodcastle Theater screening of &quot;&quot;, Smith announced that the Weinsteins had finally sold the rights to the film, and later confirmed on a podcast interview that he had regained the rights himself, announcing his intent to re-release the film on home media and digital the following year, in addition to touring the film theatrically.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack album accompanying the film was released in the United States on November 2, 1999, by Maverick Records. It features an orchestral score by Howard Shore, performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra; and the song &quot;Still&quot;, written, performed, and produced by Morissette. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the &quot;rich, effective&quot; score as &quot;alternately melodramatic and humorous&quot;.

Several songs used in the film do not appear on the soundtrack, including &quot;Magic Moments&quot; performed by Perry Como, &quot;Candy Girl&quot; by New Edition, &quot;Alabamy Bound&quot; performed by Ray Charles, and others. In one scene, Matt Damon&#x27;s Loki recites the hook of the Run-DMC song &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Dogma&quot; was the third-highest-grossing film in its opening weekend, behind &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; and &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;, grossing $8.7 million. The film grossed a domestic total of $30.7 million from a $10 million budget. It remains the highest-grossing film in Smith&#x27;s View Askewniverse series.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Dogma&quot; has an approval rating of 68% based on 130 reviews, with an average rating of 6.25/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Provocative and audacious, &quot;Dogma&quot; is an uneven but thoughtful religious satire that&#x27;s both respectful and irreverent.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 62 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three-and-a-half stars (out of four).

Some religious groupsin particular the activist Catholic Leaguedenounced the film as blasphemous. Other groups staged protests outside theaters screening the film. Director Kevin Smith himself attended one of these protests, pretending to be opposed to the movie. Roger Ebert noted that no official objection came from the Catholic Church itself. &quot;We are actually free in this country to disagree about religion,&quot; Ebert wrote, &quot;and blasphemy is not a crime.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Possible sequel==
In late November 2005, Smith responded to talk of a possible sequel on the ViewAskew.com message boards:

When asked about the sequel in October 2017, Smith said it would not happen, as he no longer desired to make any new religious films.

Near the same time as the cancellation, just weeks before the Weinstein scandal broke to the public, Harvey Weinstein pitched to Smith about doing a sequel. Not much came from this pitch, but it was just a mere idea for Weinstein. According to Smith in an interview with &quot;Business Insider&quot;, he recalls:

Smith believes that he only got the call because, &quot;It was him looking to see who was a friend still because his life was about to shift completely.&quot;

Damon returned to reprise his role as a reborn Loki in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;. In a fourth-wall breaking monologue, he explains after the events of &quot;Dogma&quot; God once again banished him to Earth, this time to the Mediterranean Sea where he was rescued by Italian fishermen after getting amnesia, describing the plot of Damon&#x27;s film &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;: he remarks that would make his current form his &quot;&quot;reborn&quot; identity&quot;.

While promoting &quot;Clerks III&quot;, Smith reiterated that Weinstein still owned &quot;Dogma&quot;, and tried to buy the film&#x27;s rights back once he was assured the money would not go directly to Weinstein, who is currently imprisoned. Despite increasingly larger offers from Smith&#x27;s camp and a letter sharing how personal &quot;Dogma&quot; was for him, their offers were denied by Weinstein&#x27;s lawyer. Smith described the film as a movie that is &quot;held hostage&quot; and shared his wish to both tour the film as a re-release and to produce a sequel if he would get the rights back.

== In pop culture ==
A scene in which Jay says the lines, &quot;I fell in love with you! We fell in love with you! Guys like us just don&#x27;t fall out of the fucking sky, you know?&quot; and &quot;Beautiful, naked, big-titty women just don&#x27;t fall out the sky, you know?&quot;, was sampled on Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign&#x27;s song, &quot;Back to Me&quot;, featuring Freddie Gibbs. The song is the fifth track on the duo&#x27;s collaborative album &quot;Vultures 1&quot;, according to the official tracklist.

<text>The National Lacrosse League (NLL) is a men&#x27;s professional box lacrosse league in North America. The league is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is the oldest lacrosse league in North America.

The NLL currently has fourteen teams: eight in the United States and six in Canada. The NLL ranks third in average attendance for pro indoor sports worldwide, behind only the NHL and NBA. Unlike other box lacrosse leagues, which play in the summer, the NLL plays its games in the winter and spring, from December to June. Each year, the playoff teams battle for the National Lacrosse League Cup. The NLL has averaged between 8,900 and 10,700 spectators per game each year since 2004.

==Box lacrosse rules==

The NLL plays four 15-minute quarters with 2-minute breaks between quarters and a 15-minute half-time. At the start of the each quarter and after every goal, players &quot;face-off&quot; at the center of the field to determine who will get possession. This is done by the two players pushing the heads of their sticks together with the game ball in the middle. A scrum-like match usually happens when the players on either team try and win the ball.

If a game is tied after regulation, the two teams play sudden death overtime. Each team may take a 45-second timeout per half. Each team dresses 19 players: 2 goaltenders and 17 &quot;runners&quot;. NLL goals are wide and tall.

The NLL uses a 30-second shot clock, which is similar to a professional or collegiate basketball shot clock. The clock starts its countdown once one team gets possession of the ball. If the offense does not shoot the ball in time, they lose possession. However, if the offense shoots on goal and then retrieves the ball, the shot clock is restarted.

Fighting is a 5-minute major penalty and does not result in an automatic ejection.

==Season and playoffs==

Each team in the NLL plays eighteen games during the regular season, nine each at home and away. The league has one standings table for its 14 teams. NLL games are typically played on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays while some weekends see teams play twice.

The regular season begins in December and ends in April. Starting in 2018, the league announced that the playoffs would be expanded to eight teams to accommodate expansion.

Beginning with the 2024 season, the playoffs feature the top 8 teams in the standings. The first round is single-elimination, and the Conference Finals and Championship rounds are best-of-three.

==Players==
As of the 2024 season, the NLL had a salary cap of US$1,615,000 per team with a minimum salary of $50,000 per player. The average salary as of the 2024 season was $85,000, and the maximum salary for a veteran player $150,000. Most NLL players have full-time jobs off the floor, such as Buffalo&#x27;s John Tavares, a high school teacher in Mississauga, Ontario. As of 2024, the NLL salary cap was $1,615,000, with Buffalo Business First reporter Paul Lane citing the following pay scale:

* Rookies: $50,000
* Second-year players: $50,000-$75,000
* Veteran minimum: $100,000
* Veteran maximum: $150,000
* Average salary: $85,000

Although eight of the fourteen teams are based in the U.S., less than 7% of players are American. Approximately 83% are Canadian and 10% are Haudenosaunee, from either Canada or the U.S.

==Teams==
===Current teams===
Beginning with the 2024 NLL season, the league eliminated its East and West Conferences that existed during the 2023 NLL season and all teams play in a single division with every team playing every other team at least once.
An asterisk (*) denotes the franchise moved to its present location and has been in one or more previous locations in its history (see franchise timeline below or team pages for relocation history).

==History==
===Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League===

The rebirth of major professional box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13, 1986, with the formation of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League (EPBLL), which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz. The &quot;Eagle League&quot; moniker was inspired by a meeting with Iroquois leaders, whose culture views the animal as a tutelary spirit. Previously, in 1985, box lacrosse sponsored an event played at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The USA/Canada Superseries was an eight-game series seen as a precursor to the new league.

Darrell Russell was named Commissioner of the league, which had four teams based in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and East Rutherford, New Jersey. The EPBLL opened play for the 1987 season with two games on 10 January 1987: the Philadelphia Wings at the New Jersey Saints (Philadelphia defeated New Jersey 11–8) and the Baltimore Thunder at the Washington Wave.

The four teams contested a six-game regular season before a postseason that saw all four teams qualify for a single knockout tournament, which ended with the Baltimore Thunder being crowned as the EPBLL&#x27;s first champion. Coached by Bob Griebe, the Baltimore Thunder defeated the Washington Wave by a score of 11–10 to capture the league&#x27;s first championship.

The league announced that a total of 124,536 fans attended Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League games in its first season.

====1988====
The same four teams played in the second season of the EPBLL. The teams expanded to an eight-game schedule, and set up a three-team playoff with the regular season winner claiming a bye to the title game. The New Jersey Saints became the second league champions by defeating the Washington Wave 17–16 before 8,125 fans at the Capital Centre. For the Wave, it was the second time in as many years they reached the championship game, only to lose a one-goal game.

After the season, the league announced that the champion Saints would relocate to the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island and be called the New York Saints beginning in the 1989 season. Moreover, the league itself would be changing its name, adopting the more conventional Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL) name, as the spiritual implications of its original name proved too cryptic for most people to understand.

The MILL announced that it awarded expansion teams to Detroit and Boston, to begin play in the 1989 season. The Detroit team was named the Turbos, and played at Joe Louis Arena; the Boston entry was called the New England Blazers and they played their home games at the Worcester Centrum.

====1989====
Each of the six teams played an eight-game schedule in 1989, with an even four home and road games.

In its first ever regular season game, 12,171 fans watched the expansion Turbos defeat the Washington Wave 11–9 in Detroit to start 1989 season. As the season went on, regular season attendance figures for the league totaled at 230,724 for 24 regular season games, which made an average of 9,614 people in the stands per game. When adding the postseason, the numbers grew to 255,088 total and an average of 9,811 a game. The Philadelphia Wings captured the league championship in front of a record postseason crowd of 16,042 at the Spectrum, defeating the New York Saints 11–10.

After the championship game, the league announced expansion into Pittsburgh, with a team called the Pittsburgh Bulls. The new team effectively replaced the Washington Wave, who closed operations after three seasons.

====1990====
In 1990, each of the six teams played an eight-game schedule. Near of the end of the season, the New York Saints defeated the Philadelphia Wings 8–5 before the first sellout and the largest crowd in league history: 17,177 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Saints&#x27; victory forced a playoff rematch the following week. However, the Wings won that game and later went on to become the first team to win a second league championship, defeating the New England Blazers 17–7 in front of 11,479 fans for their second consecutive title.

The league announced that attendance for 26 total games during the season was 287,585, increasing the average attendance per game to 11,060. After the season, the MILL announced the signing of twin brothers Paul Gait and Gary Gait, 3-time All-Americans at Syracuse, to the Detroit Turbos after being drafted. The two brothers had won national championships with the Syracuse Orange in 1988, 1989, and 1990.

====1991====

The Vancouver Ravens suspended operations after three seasons, while the owners of the Minnesota Wild purchased the dormant Montreal Express franchise and relocated it to Saint Paul, calling the team the Minnesota Swarm.

====2005====

===Franchise timeline by team===

=== NLL Unboxed program ===
In November 2023, ahead of the 2024 season, the NLL launched an initiative known as &quot;NLL Unboxed&quot; (stylized as &quot;NLL unBOXed&quot;). It is designed to help promote the sport of lacrosse via youth and school programs in strategic markets that do not currently have NLL franchises, and build interest in the sport in the lead-up to lacrosse at the 2028 Summer Olympics. Each market in the program receives a team brand as a &quot;lacrosse community&quot;, which is used as part of promotion for the program and related activities.

As part of the program, the league began to hold &quot;NLL Unboxed Series&quot; games in the 2024 season, which are played in the market of one of the lacrosse communities in the program. The first of these games was hosted by Castors de Montréal in February 2024, with the Toronto Rock playing the New York Riptide at Place Bell in Laval, Quebec. It marked the first NLL game played in the Montreal area since the Montreal Express&#x27; first and only season in 2002.
==National Lacrosse League Players&#x27; Association==

The National Lacrosse League Players&#x27; Association (NLLPA), formerly the Professional Lacrosse Players&#x27; Association (PLPA), is the trade union of players in the NLL. The PLPA was founded in 1991 by Dave Succamore (a former Detroit Turbos player), Peter Schmitz (a former Boston Blazers player and president) and four other players from other teams with assistance by labor attorney Ronald L. Jaros. The union was organized to assist with missed work pay for players who miss their regular jobs for games; expanded expense reimbursement; more opportunities for promotional pay on top of their regular game salaries; more time for rookies to assess their initial contracts; game compensation for practice players; free agency; a standard grievance and arbitration process for fines and suspensions. Before the players&#x27; union was in place, injured players&#x27; medical bills were paid by the League through workman&#x27;s compensation insurance in the states where teams were located.

==Media coverage==
In the early 2000s, CNN Sports Illustrated aired NLL games regularly. The NLL had had its All-Star Games and Championship games on NBC in 2005 and ESPN2 in 2006.

In 2007, the NLL had a regularly scheduled &quot;Game of the Week&quot; on Versus. For the 2008 season, due to dispute between the Professional Lacrosse Players&#x27; Association and the NLL owners in completing the collective bargaining agreement, the &quot;Game of the Week&quot; on Versus was cancelled. Also in 2007, the NLL signed an agreement with Sirius Satellite Radio, who were the &quot;Official Satellite Radio Partner&quot;. The pact included a &quot;Game of the Week&quot; as well as a weekly highlight show.

For the 2011 season, the NLL returned to Versus, beginning with coverage of the 2011 All-Star Game, followed by 6 weekly games, and 2 playoff games, one of these being the championship game. In the 2012 season, the rights shifted to CBS Sports Network, which carried a package of eight regular season games.

In 2012, the NLL reached an agreement with the YouTube channel The Lacrosse Network, with most games broadcast live on the channel, and all games available on-demand after their broadcast. For the 2016 season, the league moved to Fox Sports&#x27; streaming platform Fox Sports Go. Beginning with the 2016 division semifinals, the NLL introduced an in-house NLLTV service operated by NeuLion.

In the 2017 season, the NLL reached a two-season deal with Twitter to stream a weekly game, as well as playoff games and the Champion&#x27;s Cup, via the social network&#x27;s live streaming features. A separate deal was reached with CBS Sports Digital to stream games on its subscription platform SportsLive.

For the 2018–19 season, the league announced a broadcasting agreement with Turner Sports, under which its games would be streamed exclusively by B/R Live.

For the 2021–22 season, the NLL reached a new media rights agreement with ESPN Inc., under which all games would stream on ESPN+ in the United States, and at least 10 would air on an ESPN television channel. In Canada, the league also returned to TSN (which is minority-owned by ESPN) for the first time since 2016, airing a Saturday-night package focusing on its Canadian franchises, playoff games, and streaming of other games online on subscription platform TSN+. All other game broadcasts are produced in-house by the league, using a mix of on-site staff and REMI hubs (with Dome Productions, a joint venture between TSN&#x27;s parent company Bell Media and rival Rogers Media, handling the hub for Canadian teams and other games broadcast by TSN).

==Video games==
&quot;Blast Lacrosse&quot;, a video game based on the NLL, was released on 23 May 2001. Developed by Sandbox Studios and published by Acclaim Entertainment, it was the first lacrosse video game and included all nine teams from the NLL&#x27;s 15th season (2001).

On 31 March 2010, the NLL announced it had partnered with Crosse Studio and Triple B Games to develop &quot;NLL Lacrosse 2010&quot; presented by Reebok Lacrosse. The game was released exclusively on Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Indie Games on April 23, 2010. Crosse Studio and Triple B Games developed &quot;Inside Lacrosse&#x27;s College Lacrosse 2010&quot; in 2009 before approaching the NLL to license their next game.

<doc id="98996" wikidata="Q725859" url="?curid=98996" title="Herman of Carinthia">
<text>Herman of Carinthia (1105/1110 – after 1154), also called Hermanus Dalmata or Sclavus Dalmata, Secundus, by his own words born in the &quot;heart of Istria&quot;, was a philosopher, astronomer, astrologer, mathematician and translator of Arabic works into Latin.

Alongside Adelard of Bath, John of Seville, Gerard of Cremona and Plato of Tivoli, Herman is the most important translator of Arabic astronomical works in 12th century. The influence of his translations on the development of medieval European astronomy was especially large.

==Name==
Herman (also spelled Hermann) is known by several bynames in English and Latin referring to his land of origin or his ethnicity: Hermann of Carinthia (&quot;Hermannus de Carinthia&quot;); Hermann of Dalmatia or Hermann the Dalmatian (&quot;Hermannus Dalmata&quot;); or Hermann the Slav (&quot;Hermannus Sclavus&quot;). Herman always refers to his homeland as Carinthia or Istria. His own preferred nickname was &quot;Hermannus Secundus&quot;, that is, the &quot;second Hermann&quot;, by way of which he declared himself the successor of Hermannus Contractus, an earlier writer on the astrolabe.

==Life==
The main sources for Herman&#x27;s life are the prologues to his own works. These can be supplemented by a few references to him in the writings of his contemporaries. In his own account, he was born in the early 12th century, possibly around 1105 or 1110, in central Istria, then part of the Duchy of Carinthia in the Holy Roman Empire. The location is difficult to pin down given the much broader extent of the March of Istria in the 12th century, which included the Karst Plateau, Trieste, Duino and most of the area of later Inner Carniola, possibly even encompassing the upper Vipava Valley. The term &quot;central Istria&quot; was likely used for all those (predominantly Slavic-inhabited) areas under the rule of the margrave of Istria, as opposed to the predominantly Romance-speaking coastal towns which lived under an autonomous municipal regime.

Herman most likely went to a Benedictine monastic school in Istria. He subsequently studied under Thierry of Chartres, either at Paris or at Chartres, before 1138. It is possible that he first met Robert of Ketton in Paris or Chartres. Richard Hakluyt, quoting an anonymous Latin source from the time of the Second Crusade, says that Robert &quot;traveled through France, Italy, Dalmatia, and Greece, and came at last into Asia, where he lived in great danger of his life among the cruel Saracens, but yet learned perfectly the Arabian tongue&quot; and &quot;returned by sea into Spain&quot;, adding that Herman &quot;had accompanied him in his long voyage.&quot; This single passage has been elaborated with many conjectures by later historians, some having him pass through Constantinople on his way to Baghdad in 1135 and sojourning in Damascus in 1136–1138.

The first securely datable event in Herman&#x27;s life is his translation of Sahl ibn Bishr&#x27;s &quot;Fatidica&quot; in 1138. In fact, all his activities can be traced only for the period 1138–1143, when he was in Spain.

==Works==
===Translation of Islamic works===
In 1142 Herman was in Spain and became involved in a project to translate Islamic texts.
Peter the Venerable recruited a team, including Herman, to translate five texts about Islam into Latin. Different members of the team appear to have concentrated on different works, and Herman is credited as the main translator of two of them: &quot;De generatione Muhamet et nutritura eius&quot; and &quot;De doctrina Muhamet&quot;.

The most significant translation in the collection was that of the Qur&#x27;an. This was entitled &quot;Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete&quot; and was the first known translation of the Qur&#x27;an into a European language. Robert of Ketton was its principal translator, according to most sources (including the &quot;Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete&quot; itself). However, Herman may have had some input, given the team nature of the project.
Despite being an imperfect translation, &quot;Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete&quot; remained the standard one for centuries, circulating in manuscript before being printed in the 1543 edition published in Basel by Theodor Bibliander. In this edition both Herman&#x27;s above-mentioned translations of treatises about Islam appeared together with a preface by Martin Luther.

===Translations of the classics===
*Herman translated Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; around 1140, possibly in collaboration with Robert of Ketton. (There were also other twelfth century translations).
*Herman translated Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Planisphaerium&quot; in Toulouse in 1143. Herman translated it from an Arabic translation from the Greek (jointly with commentaries of Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti, who worked in Córdoba in the 10th century). Western European scholastics became aware of Ptolemy&#x27;s astronomical views via this translation dedicated to Thierry of Chartres. (This translation was for a long time believed to be the only surviving link to Ptolemy&#x27;s original. Later another Arabic translation was found to have been preserved in Istanbul).

Herman also translated Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Canon of Kings&quot;. For long many thought that Ptolemy was translated by German Herman Contractus and not by Herman of Carinthia.

===Astrology and astronomy===
Herman&#x27;s first known translation was the sixth book of an astrological treatise &quot;Liber sextus astronomie&quot; by the Jewish writer Sahl ibn Bishr. It was released in Spain in 1138 under the title &quot;Zaelis fatidica&quot; (&quot;Prophesy&quot;). Sahl ibn Bishr had been writing in the Greek astrological tradition. Ibn Bishr&#x27;s first five books were preserved in the translation of John of Seville (Johannes Hispanus) (circa 1090 – circa 1150). The sixth book deals with three thematic topics regarding the influences on the world and its inhabitants. The work contains divinations based on the movements of the planets and comets.

Circa 1140 Herman translated into Latin the astronomical work of Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi &quot;Kitab al-madkhal ila ilm ahkam al nujum&quot; (&quot;Introduction to Astronomy&quot;). The work contains problems from Greek philosophy, Arabic astronomy and Eastern astrology, and was first translated into Latin by John of Seville in 1133. Herman&#x27;s less literal translation was published several times under the title &quot;Liber introductorius in astronomiam Albumasaris, Abalachii&quot; (Augusta Vindelicorum, Augsburg 1489; Venice 1495 and 1506). A large part of Herman&#x27;s translation was copied into Roger of Hereford&#x27;s &quot;Book of Astronomical Judgements&quot;. Sections of Herman&#x27;s translation were also compiled by the otherwise-unknown medieval author Georgius Zothorus Zaparus Fendulus into his richly illustrated &quot;Liber astrologiae&quot; (&quot;Liber Abumazarus&quot;).

Herman produced a version of Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Ḵwārizmī&#x27;s astronomical tables (&quot;zij&quot;) – they were also translated in 1126 by Adelard of Bath (1075–1164).

Charles Burnett (2001) postulates that Herman collaborated with Robert of Ketton and Hugo of Santalla on the &quot;Liber novem iudicum&quot; (the Book of Nine Judges), a collection of translations of Arabic astrologers, notably al-Kindi. Their project may have been to supplant the current superstitious Latin astrology with Arabic astronomical science. Arabic texts cite often Hermes as an authority. Burnett postulates that Renaissance magi merely continued this Hermetic tradition begun by Herman, Robert and Hugh. Herman shares technical terminology with Hugh and a penchant for evocation of the &quot;Asclepius&quot;, most notably in &quot;De essentiis&quot; (see below)

===Original writings===
His original contribution to philosophy was &quot;De essentiis&quot; (&quot;On essences&quot;). In this work Herman deals with five Aristotelian categories (causa, motus, spatium, tempus, habitudo). He started to write this treatise in 1143 in Toulouse and he completed it the same year in Béziers. In 1982 this book was reprinted in Germany.

Some other works are believed to be Herman&#x27;s:
* meteorological &quot;Liber imbrium&quot; (&quot;A book about precipitations&quot;) (1140 to 1141)
* astrological &quot;De indagatione cordis&quot; (&quot;About heart researches&quot;) (after 1140)
In the text (or &quot;a manuscript&quot;, the syntax of this article was not clear) of &quot;De indagatione cordis&quot; there are many names of scientists and scholars whose work Herman knew and used: Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi (787–886), Sahl ibn Bishr, Aomar Tiberia, Abu al-Kindi (801–873), the eighth-century Jewish astrologer Al Batrig Mashallah (Messahalla), Hermes, and Dorotheos of Sidon.
*mathematical and astronomical &quot;De mensura, De utilitatibus astrolabii&quot;, &quot;De compositione et usu astrolabii&quot; (before 1143 – Herman was certainly interested in the Astrolabe – the portrait shows Herman with one)

Many medieval authors refer to Herman&#x27;s work, for instance Albert the Great (Albert von Bollstädt, Albertus Magnus), instructor to Thomas Aquinas, in his work &quot;Speculum astronomiae&quot;.

<doc id="98998" wikidata="Q117060" url="?curid=98998" title="Spasticity">
<text>Spasticity () is a feature of altered skeletal muscle performance with a combination of paralysis, increased tendon reflex activity, and hypertonia. It is also colloquially referred to as an unusual &quot;tightness&quot;, stiffness, or &quot;pull&quot; of muscles.

Clinically, spasticity results from the loss of inhibition of motor neurons, causing excessive velocity-dependent muscle contraction. This ultimately leads to hyperreflexia, an exaggerated deep tendon reflex. Spasticity is often treated with the drug baclofen, which acts as an agonist at GABA receptors, which are inhibitory.

Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common form of cerebral palsy, which is a group of permanent movement problems that do not get worse over time. GABA&#x27;s inhibitory actions contribute to baclofen&#x27;s efficacy as an anti-spasticity agent.

== Pathophysiology ==
Spasticity is usually caused by damage to nerve pathways within the brain or spinal cord that control muscle movement. This can cause an imbalance in the inhibitory and excitatory signals sent to the muscles. 

Spasticity mostly occurs in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) affecting the upper motor neurons in the form of a lesion, such as spastic diplegia, or upper motor neuron syndrome, and can also be present in various types of multiple sclerosis, where it occurs as a symptom of the progressively-worsening attacks on myelin sheaths and is thus unrelated to the types of spasticity present in neuromuscular cerebral palsy rooted spasticity disorders.

The cause of spasticity is thought to be where an imbalance occurs in the excitatory and inhibitory input to α motor neurons caused by damage to the spinal cord and/or central nervous system. The damage causes a change in the balance of signals between the nervous system and the muscles, leading to increased excitability in muscles. This is common in people who have cerebral palsy, brain injuries or a spinal cord injury, but it can happen to anybody e.g. having a stroke.

One factor that is thought to be related to spasticity is the stretch reflex. This reflex is important in coordinating normal movements in which muscles are contracted and relaxed and in keeping the muscle from stretching too far. Although the result of spasticity is problems with the muscles, spasticity is actually caused by an injury to a part of the central nervous system (the brain or spinal cord) that controls voluntary movements. The damage causes a change in the balance of signals between the nervous system and the muscles. This imbalance leads to increased activity (excitability) in the muscles. Receptors in the muscles receive messages from the nervous system, which sense the amount of stretch in the muscle and sends that signal to the brain. The brain responds by sending a message back to reverse the stretch by contracting or shortening.

Overall, a defining feature of spasticity is that the increased resistance to passive stretch is velocity-dependent. Lance (1980) describes it this way: &quot;...a motor disorder, characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyper-excitability of the stretch reflex as one component of the upper motor neurone (UMN) syndrome&quot;.

Spasticity is found in conditions where the brain and/or spinal cord are damaged or fail to develop normally; these include cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and acquired brain injury including stroke. Damage to the CNS as a result of stroke or spinal cord injury, alter the [net inhibition] of peripheral nerves in the affected region. This change in input to bodily structures tends to favor excitation and therefore increase nerve excitability. CNS damage also causes nerve cell membranes to rest in a more [depolarized] state. The combination of decreased inhibition and an increased depolarized state of cell membranes, decreases action potential threshold for nerve signal conduction, and thus increases activity of structures innervated by the affected nerves (spasticity). Muscles affected in this way have many other potential features of altered performance in addition to spasticity, including muscle &quot;weakness&quot;; decreased movement control; clonus (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions often symptomatic of muscle over-exertion and/or muscle fatigue); exaggerated deep tendon reflexes; and decreased endurance.

Clonus (i.e. involuntary, rhythmic, muscular contractions and relaxations) tends to co-exist with spasticity in many cases of stroke and spinal cord injury likely due to their common physiological origins. Some consider clonus as simply an extended outcome of spasticity. Although closely linked, clonus is not seen in all patients with spasticity. Clonus tends to not be present with spasticity in patients with significantly increased muscle tone, as the muscles are constantly active and therefore not engaging in the characteristic on/off cycle of clonus. Clonus results due to an increased motor neuron excitation (decreased action potential threshold) and is common in muscles with long conduction delays, such as the long reflex tracts found in distal muscle groups. Clonus is commonly seen in the ankle but may exist in other distal structures as well, such as the knee or spine.

== Characteristics of spasticity ==

A commonly known feature of spasticity, known as Clasp-knife response is the sudden decrease of tone after initial resistance, also referred to as a lengthening reaction or a &quot;catch-yield sequence&quot;. This is because of inverse stretch reflex activation mediated by the Golgi tendon organ on sustained muscle stretching resulting in sudden relaxation of the muscle. 

Another characteristic of spasticity, which may be referred to as &quot;seatbelt effect&quot; of spasticity, is different as the amount of resistance offered by the muscle is directly proportional to velocity of the passive movement. It is caused by increased muscle spindle excitability and velocity sensitivity of Ia spindle afferent nerve fibres, resulting in excessive activation of alpha motor neurons of the spinal cord. It is similar to the tug we feel initially while pulling the seatbelt of a car beyond a certain velocity, hence the name &quot;seatbelt effect&quot;

== Diagnosis ==
The clinical underpinnings of two of the most common spasticity conditions, spastic cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, can be described as follows: in spastic diplegia, the upper motor neuron lesion arises often as a result of neonatal asphyxia, while in conditions like multiple sclerosis, spasticity is thought by some to be as a result of the autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheaths around nerve endings—which in turn can &quot;mimic&quot; the gamma amino butyric acid deficiencies present in the damaged nerves of spastic cerebral palsy children, leading to roughly the same &quot;presentation&quot; of spasticity, but which clinically is fundamentally different from the latter.

===Grading===
Spasticity can be graded on scales including the modified Ashworth scale, the Tardieu scale and the Penn spasm frequency scale.

===Assessment===
Spasticity is assessed by feeling the resistance of the muscle to passive lengthening in its most relaxed state. A spastic muscle will have immediately noticeable, often quite forceful, increased resistance to passive stretch when moved with speed and/or while attempting to be stretched out, as compared to the non-spastic muscles in the same person&#x27;s body (if any exist). Spasticity can be differentiated from rigidity with the help of simple clinical examination, as rigidity is a uniform increase in the tone of agonist and antagonist muscles which is not related to the velocity at which the movement is performed passively and remains the same throughout the range of movement while spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in tone resulting from the hyperexcitability of stretch reflexes. It primarily involves the antigravity muscles – flexors of the upper limb and extensors of the lower limb. During the passive stretch, a brief &quot;free interval&quot; is appreciated in spasticity but not in rigidity because the resting muscle is electromyographically silent in spasticity. In contrast, in rigidity, the resting muscle shows firing.

As there are many features of the upper motor neuron syndrome, there are likely to be multiple other changes in affected musculature and surrounding bones, such as progressive malalignments of bone structure around the spastic muscles (leading for example to the scissor gait and tip-toeing gait due to ankle equinus or ankle planter flexion deformity in spastic cerebral palsy children, scissor gait is caused by spasticity of the hip adductor muscles while tip-toeing gait is caused by spasticity of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex or calf musculature. Also, following an upper motor neuron lesion, there may be multiple muscles affected, to varying degrees, depending on the location and severity of the upper motor neuron damage. The result for the affected individual, is that they may have any degree of impairment, ranging from a mild to a severe movement disorder. A relatively mild movement disorder may contribute to a loss of dexterity in an arm, or difficulty with high level mobility such as running or walking on stairs. A severe movement disorder may result in marked loss of function with minimal or no volitional muscle activation. There are several scales used to measure spasticity, such as the King&#x27;s hypertonicity scale, the Tardieu, and the modified Ashworth. Of these three, only the King&#x27;s hypertonicity scale measures a range of muscle changes from the UMN lesion, including active muscle performance as well as passive response to stretch.

Assessment of a movement disorder featuring spasticity may involve several health professionals depending on the affected individual&#x27;s situation, and the severity of their condition. This may include physical therapists, physicians (including neurologists and rehabilitation physicians), orthotists and occupational therapists. Assessment is needed of the affected individual&#x27;s goals, their function, and any symptoms that may be related to the movement disorder, such as pain. A thorough assessment will include analysis of posture, active movement, muscle strength, movement control and coordination, and endurance, as well as spasticity (response of the muscle to stretch). Spastic muscles typically demonstrate a loss of selective movement, including a loss of eccentric control (decreased ability to actively lengthen). While multiple muscles in a limb are usually affected in the upper motor neuron syndrome, there is usually an imbalance of activity, such that there is a stronger pull in one direction, such as into elbow flexion. Decreasing the degree of this imbalance is a common focus of muscle strengthening programs. Spastic movement disorders also typically feature a loss of stabilisation of an affected limb or the head from the trunk, so a thorough assessment requires this to be analysed as well.

Secondary effects are likely to impact on assessment of spastic muscles. If a muscle has impaired function following an upper motor neuron lesion, other changes such as increased muscle stiffness are likely to affect the feeling of resistance to passive stretch. Other secondary changes such as loss of muscle fibres following acquired muscle weakness are likely to compound the weakness arising from the upper motor neuron lesion. In severely affected spastic muscles, there may be marked secondary changes, such as muscle contracture, particularly if management has been delayed or absent.

== Treatment ==
Treatment should be based on assessment by relevant health professionals. For spastic muscles with mild-to-moderate impairment, exercise should be the mainstay of management, and is likely needed to be prescribed by a physiatrist (a doctor specialized in rehabilitation medicine), occupational therapist, physical therapist, accredited exercise physiologist (AEP) or other health professional skilled in neurological rehabilitation.

Muscles with severe spasticity are likely to be more limited in their ability to exercise, and may require help to do this. In spastic cerebral palsy children the main treatment modality of spasticity is conservative in the form of botulinum toxin A injection and various physical therapy modalities such as serial casting, sustained stretching and medical pharmacologic treatment. Spasticity in cerebral palsy children is usually generalized although with varying degrees of severity across the affected extremities and trunk musculature. Neglected or inappropriately treated spasticity can eventually lead to joint contractures. Both spasticity and contractures can cause joint subluxations or dislocations and severe gait difficulties. In the event of contracture there is no role for conservative treatment. Hip dislocation and ankle equinus deformity are known to arise from muscle spasticity primarily. Orthopedic surgical reconstruction of the hip is commonly practiced to improve sitting balance, nursing care and relieve hip pain.
Treatment should be done with firm and constant manual contact positioned over nonspastic areas to avoid stimulating the spastic muscle(s). Alternatively, rehabilitation robotics can be used to provide high volumes of passive or assisted movement, depending on the individual&#x27;s requirements; this form of therapy can be useful if therapists are at a premium, and has been found effective at reducing spasticity in patients with strokes. For muscles that lack any volitional control, such as after complete spinal cord injury, exercise may be assisted, and may require equipment, such as using a standing frame to sustain a standing position.

A general treatment guideline can be followed that involves:
* The initial focus on first activating contraction of antagonist muscles to provide reciprocal inhibition and lengthen spastic muscles
* Reciprocal actions are attempted. Agonist contractions are performed first in small ranges progressing to larger arcs of movement
* Highly stressful activities be minimized early in training
* Functional skills are targeted for training
* Patients and family/caregivers should be educated about the importance of maintaining range of motion and doing daily exercise

Medical interventions may include oral medications such as baclofen, clonazepam, clonidine, diazepam, or dantrolene. If refractive to oral agents, spasticity may be treated with intrathecal baclofen therapy (IBT) when spasticity. IBT may also be used in patients with limited tolerance to other modalities. Phenol injections can be used, or botulinum toxin injections into the muscle belly, to attempt to dampen the signals between nerve and muscle. The effectiveness of medications vary between individuals, and vary based on location of the upper motor neuron lesion (in the brain or the spinal cord). Medications are commonly used for spastic movement disorders, but research has not shown functional benefit for some drugs. Some studies have shown that medications have been effective in decreasing spasticity, but that this has not been accompanied by functional benefits. Surgery could be required for a tendon release in the case of a severe muscle imbalance leading to contracture. In spastic CP, selective dorsal rhizotomy has also been used to decrease muscle overactivity.

Incorporating hydrotherapy in the treatment program may help decrease spasm severity, promote functional independence, improve motor recovery and decrease medication required for spasticity, which may help reduce the side effects that are possible with oral drug treatments. A 2004 study compared the effects of hydrotherapy on spasticity, oral baclofen dosage and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores of patients with a spinal cord injury (SCI). It was found that subjects who received hydrotherapy treatment obtained increased FIM scores and a decreased intake of oral baclofen medication. A 2009 study looked at the effect of hydrotherapy to decrease spasticity on post-stroke, hemiparetic patients with limited mobility and concluded that there was a significantly larger increase in FIM scores compared to the control group that did not receive hydrotherapy.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for those with spastic muscles depends on multiple factors, including the severity of the spasticity and the associated movement disorder, access to specialised and intensive management, and ability of the affected individual to maintain the management plan (particularly an exercise program). Most people with a significant UMN lesion will have ongoing impairment, but most of these will be able to make progress. The most important factor to indicate ability to progress is seeing improvement, but improvement in many spastic movement disorders may not be seen until the affected individual receives help from a specialised team or health professional.

== Research ==
Doublecortin positive cells, similar to stem cells, are extremely adaptable and, when extracted from a brain, cultured and then re-injected in a lesioned area of the same brain, they can help repair and rebuild it. The treatment using them would take some time to be available for general public use, as it has to clear regulations and trials.

== History ==

Historical progression of spasticity and the upper motor neuron lesion on which it is based has progressed considerably in recent decades. However, the term &quot;spasticity&quot; is still often used interchangeably with &quot;upper motor neuron syndrome&quot; in the clinical settings, and it is not unusual to see patients labeled as &quot;spastic&quot; who actually demonstrate not just spasticity alone, but also an array of upper motor neuron findings.

Research has clearly shown that exercise is beneficial for spastic muscles, even though in the very early days of research it was assumed that strength exercise would &quot;increase&quot; spasticity. Also, from at least the 1950s through at least the 1980s, there was a strong focus on other interventions for spastic muscles, particularly stretching and splinting, but the evidence does not support these as effective. While splinting is not considered effective for decreasing spasticity, a range of different orthotics are effectively used for preventing muscle contractures on patients with spasticity. In the case of spastic diplegia there is also a permanent neurosurgical treatment for spasticity, selective dorsal rhizotomy, that directly targets nerves in the spine that cause the spasticity, and destroys them, so that the spasticity cannot be activated at all.

<text>Richmond () is a city in eastern Wayne County, Indiana, United States. Bordering the state of Ohio, it is the county seat of Wayne County. In the 2020 census, the city had a population of 35,720. It is the principal city of the Richmond micropolitan area. Situated largely within Wayne Township, its area includes a non-contiguous portion in nearby Boston Township, where Richmond Municipal Airport is located.

Richmond is sometimes called the &quot;cradle of recorded jazz&quot; because the earliest jazz recordings and records were made at the studio of Gennett Records, a division of the Starr Piano Company. Gennett Records was the first to record such artists as Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Jelly Roll Morton, Hoagy Carmichael, Lawrence Welk, and Gene Autry. The city has twice received the All-America City Award, most recently in 2009.

==History==

In 1806 the first European Americans in the area, Quaker families from the state of North Carolina, settled along the East Fork of the Whitewater River. This was part of a general westward migration in the early decades after the American Revolution. John Smith was one of the earliest settlers. Richmond is still home to several Quaker institutions, including Friends United Meeting, Richmond Friends School, Earlham College and the Earlham School of Religion.

The first post office in Richmond was established in 1818 with Robert Morrison as the first postmaster. The town was officially incorporated in 1840, with John Sailor elected the first mayor.

Early cinema and television pioneer Charles Francis Jenkins grew up on a farm north of Richmond, where he began inventing useful gadgets. As the Richmond Telegram reported, on June 6, 1894, Jenkins gathered his family, friends and newsmen at his cousin&#x27;s jewelry store in downtown Richmond and projected a filmed motion picture for the first time in front of an audience. The motion picture was of a vaudeville entertainer performing a butterfly dance, which Jenkins had filmed himself. Jenkins filed for a patent for the Phantoscope projector in November 1894 and it was issued in March 1895. A modified version of the Phantoscope was later sold to Thomas Edison, who named it Edison&#x27;s Vitascope and began projecting motion pictures in New York City vaudeville theaters, raising the curtain on American cinema.

Joseph E. Maddy is credited with founding the country&#x27;s first complete high school orchestra at Richmond, and later founded the National High School Orchestra Camp, which became the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan.

Hoagy Carmichael recorded &quot;Stardust&quot; for the first time in Richmond at the Gennett recording studio. Famed trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong was first recorded at Gennett as a member of King Oliver and his Creole Jazz Band. Many other internationally famous musicians recorded at Gennett&#x27;s Richmond facility, including Jelly Roll Morton, Bix Beiderbecke, Duke Ellington, and Fats Waller. Gennett also recorded Klan musicians.

A group of artists in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries came to be known as the Richmond Group. They included John Elwood Bundy, Charles Conner, George Herbert Baker, Maude Kaufman Eggemeyer and John Albert Seaford. The Richmond Art Museum has a collection of regional and American art. Many consider the most significant painting in the collection to be a self-portrait of Indiana-born William Merritt Chase.

The city was connected to the National Road, the first road built by the federal government and a major route west for pioneers of the 19th century. It became part of the system of National Auto Trails. The highway is now known as U.S. Route 40. One of the extant &quot;Madonna of the Trail&quot; monuments was dedicated at Richmond on October 28, 1928. It sits in a corner of Glen Miller Park adjacent to US 40.

Richmond&#x27;s cultural resources include two of Indiana&#x27;s three Egyptian mummies. One is held by the Wayne County Historical Museum and the other by Earlham College&#x27;s Joseph Moore Museum, leading to the local nickname &quot;Mummy capital of Indiana&quot;.

The arts were supported by a strong economy increasingly based on manufacturing. Richmond was once known as &quot;the lawnmower capital&quot; because it was a center for manufacturing of lawnmowers from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century. Manufacturers included Davis, Motomower, Dille-McGuire and F&amp;N. The farm machinery builder Gaar-Scott was based in Richmond. The Davis Aircraft Co., builder of a light parasol wing monoplane, operated in Richmond beginning in 1929.

After starting out in nearby Union City, Wayne Agricultural Works moved to Richmond. Wayne manufactured horse-drawn vehicles, including the &quot;kid hack&quot;, a precursor of the motorized school bus. From the early 1930s through the 1940s, Richmond had several automobile designers and manufacturers. Among the automobiles locally manufactured were the Richmond, built by the Wayne Works; the &quot;Rodefeld&quot;; the Davis; the Pilot; the Westcott; and the Crosley. In the 1950s Wayne Works changed its name to Wayne Corporation, by then a well-known bus and school-bus manufacturer. In 1967 it relocated to a site adjacent to Interstate 70. The company was a leader in school-bus safety innovations, but closed in 1992 during a period of school-bus manufacturing industry consolidations.

Richmond was known as the &quot;Rose City&quot; because of the many varieties once grown there by Hill&#x27;s Roses. The company had several sprawling complexes of greenhouses, with a total of about under glass. The annual Richmond Rose Festival honored the rose industry and was a popular summer attraction.

===Downtown explosion===

On April 6, 1968, an explosion triggered by a natural gas leak destroyed or damaged several downtown blocks and killed 41 people; more than 150 were injured. The event is documented in the book &quot;Death in a Sunny Street: The Civil Defense Story of the Richmond, Indiana Disaster, April 6, 1968&quot;, compiled by Esther Kellner.

===Cityscape===

Richmond is noted for its rich stock of historic architecture. In 2003, a book entitled &quot;Richmond Indiana: Its Physical Development and Aesthetic Heritage to 1920&quot; by Cornell University architectural historians, Michael and Mary Raddant Tomlan, was published by the Indiana Historical Society. Particularly notable buildings are the 1902 Pennsylvania Railroad Station designed by Daniel H. Burnham of Chicago and the 1893 Wayne County Court House designed by James W. McLaughlin of Cincinnati. Local architects of note include John A. Hasecoster, William S. Kaufman and Stephen O. Yates.

The significance of the architecture has been recognized. Five large districts, such as the Depot District, and several individual buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the Historic American Buildings Survey and the Historic American Engineering Record.

<text>Jay and Silent Bob are fictional characters portrayed by American actors Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, respectively. They appear in the View Askewniverse, a fictional universe used in most of the films, comics, and television programs written and produced by Smith.

Jay and Silent Bob are the only characters that have appeared in every Askewniverse film. This excludes Smith&#x27;s other projects: &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;, &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;, &quot;Cop Out&quot;, &quot;Red State&quot;, &quot;Tusk&quot;, and &quot;Yoga Hosers&quot;. The characters are shown spending most of their time selling marijuana in front of the convenience store in the &quot;Clerks&quot; films. In &quot;&quot;, they were also shown selling illegal fireworks.

==Character profiles==

Jay and Silent Bob are fictional characters created by Kevin Smith, prominently featured in his View Askewniverse films. They first appeared in &quot;Clerks&quot;.

Silent Bob, portrayed by Kevin Smith, has a reticent nature, communicating mostly through gestures and facial expressions rather than speech. When he does speak, his comments are often poignant and insightful, providing critical reflections that influence the course of the narratives. Silent Bob is characterized by his long dark hair, beard, and a backwards baseball cap, and typically wears a long coat resembling a Jedi robe. Originally a smoker, the character has been shown to have quit in later films. His background includes being raised Catholic and possessing a talent for gadgetry.

Jay, played by Jason Mewes, contrasts sharply with Silent Bob. He is verbose, frequently using crude and offensive language. Jay&#x27;s demeanor is outgoing and sometimes aggressive. He is slim, with long blonde hair, and typically wears a black knit cap in the later films. Jay&#x27;s overt sexual behavior and ambiguous sexuality are a recurring theme in his character development across the series.

=== Fictional biography ===
Both characters are said to have been born in Leonardo, New Jersey, meeting during their infancy. Throughout the series, they are often seen loitering outside the Quick Stop Groceries and engaging in various misadventures. Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s roles often serve as comic relief, but also include moments where they drive the plot or deliver key thematic messages.

==Filmography==
===&quot;Clerks&quot; (1994)===

&quot;Clerks&quot;, released in 1994, is the first film to feature Jay and Silent Bob. In the View Askewniverse timeline, it takes place the day after &quot;Mallrats&quot;. Jay and Silent Bob return to their primary business location in front of Quick Stop. Throughout the day, they are seen dancing, loitering, and harassing pedestrians. Silent Bob enters the store to buy powdered sugar while Jay goes inside to steal food. They deal marijuana to various people (including Willam Black), much to the chagrin of Quick Stop clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O&#x27;Halloran). In addition, the duo hangs out with Silent Bob&#x27;s Russian cousin Olaf, who runs a heavy metal band and is looking to do a gig in New York City.

Aware of Dante&#x27;s love triangle with Caitlin Bree and Veronica, Silent Bob says to him, &quot;You know, there&#x27;s a million fine-looking women in the world, dude. But they don&#x27;t all bring you lasagna at work. Most of &#x27;em just cheat on you.&quot;

The end credits of &quot;Clerks&quot; contain a reference to the return of Jay and Silent Bob in &quot;Dogma&quot;.

===&quot;Mallrats&quot; (1995)===

Although it was filmed one year later, the events in &quot;Mallrats&quot; occur one day before the events in &quot;Clerks&quot;. In the film, Jay and Silent Bob are loitering at a local New Jersey mall (filmed in Minnesota at the Eden Prairie Center Mall). There they are met by Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) and T.S. Quint (Jeremy London), who have broken up with their girlfriends—Rene (Shannen Doherty) and Brandi (Claire Forlani), respectively. A local game show called &quot;Truth or Date&quot; is set to be filmed at the mall that day, which is to feature Brandi. Brodie asks Jay and Silent Bob to make sure the show does not happen, and Jay says they were going to destroy the stage anyway, for lack of anything better to do.

They make several attempts to destroy the stage but fail. Later, they help Brodie and T.S. win back their girlfriends. Jay incapacitates the male contestants on &quot;Truth or Date&quot; by getting them stoned, which allows Brodie and T.S. to take their places. Silent Bob overrides the production&#x27;s video input, allowing him to play a videotape of Rene&#x27;s new boyfriend, Shannon Hamilton (Ben Affleck), having sex with a minor. The film concludes with Brodie and T.S. reconciling with their girlfriends. Jay and Silent Bob walk off into the distance with an orangutan named Susanne.

In this film, Silent Bob is revealed to be an electronics expert and won a science fair in eighth grade by turning his mother&#x27;s vibrator into a CD player using &quot;chicken wire and shit&quot;.

After the credits roll, Jay and Silent Bob are announced to return in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;.

===&quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997)===

&quot;Chasing Amy&quot; reveals that in the years since the events of &quot;Clerks&quot;, Jay and Silent Bob have found out that comic book writers/artists Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) created a popular independent comic book series entitled &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; starring the duo.

This film centers on Holden&#x27;s romantic relationship with Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), a self-identified lesbian. Though their love is initially passionate, the relationship begins to deteriorate when Holden discovers Alyssa&#x27;s past. Toward the end of the film, Jay and Silent Bob meet Holden to accept their likeness rights payment, and during this meeting, Silent Bob tells Holden the story of his former girlfriend Amy.

In his longest speech to date, Silent Bob explains that, much like in Holden&#x27;s relationship with Alyssa, he became distressed at the revelation of Amy&#x27;s sexual past, specifically that she had engaged in |threesomes. Upon discovering this, he broke up with her. Bob later realized he was not annoyed at her; rather, he felt inadequate given his lack of experience. By the time he realized this, it was too late, and she had moved on. He has since spent his life &quot;chasing Amy, so to speak&quot;.

Moved by Silent Bob&#x27;s story, Holden devises a plan to fix his relationship with Alyssa, but as in Silent Bob&#x27;s past relationship, it is too late. Holden passes the reins of power over the &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; comic and creates a new comic named &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, based on the relationship.

The scene in which Jay and Silent Bob meet Holden at the cafe to accept payment is their only appearance in &quot;Chasing Amy.&quot; However, their voices were heard again during the end credits of the movie, which contained a reference to the return of Jay and Silent Bob in &quot;Dogma&quot;, released two years after the events of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;.

===&quot;Dogma&quot; (1999)===

The events in &quot;Dogma&quot; take place after their disappointing adventure in the fictional Shermer, Illinois. These events are chronicled in the comic book story &quot;Chasing Dogma&quot;. Jay and Silent Bob decide to go back home to New Jersey. Before they leave, they meet Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino), a Roman Catholic abortion clinic worker who has lost her faith in God.

Though she is unaware of it, Bethany is the last living relative of Jesus. She has been charged with the holy quest of stopping two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon), from entering a church in New Jersey. The angels were expelled from Heaven after Loki got drunk, quit his position as the Angel of Death, and gave the finger to God. They realize that they can exploit a doctrinal loophole and get back into heaven if they lose their wings, are absolved of their sins, and then die by some means other than suicide. Bartleby reasons that entering the church in New Jersey will automatically forgive all of their sins, as total remission of sins had been granted to whoever visited that specific church on a specific date, thus allowing them to return to Heaven. Though they do not know it, if the two were to return to heaven this way, they would overturn God&#x27;s decision, thus &quot;proving God wrong&quot; and unmaking all of existence. The Metatron (Alan Rickman) tells Bethany that she is to follow two people who refer to themselves as &quot;prophets&quot;. This is revealed to be Jay and Silent Bob, who rescue Bethany from some thugs. She believes they are the prophets due to mis-hearing Jay&#x27;s statement that he &quot;could have stayed in Jersey and at least made himself a &#x27;profit&#x27;&quot;. Though initially only interested in sex, Jay and Silent Bob agree to let her come with them.

Jay and Silent Bob fulfill their roles as prophets. They predict the arrival of Rufus (Chris Rock), the 13th apostle, who was left out of the Bible because he was black, and they lead the others to former Muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek). They procure the divine instrument that will stop Azrael, and Jay reveals the location of God (&quot;John Doe Jersey&quot;). Ultimately, though inadvertently, they provide Bethany with the solution to preventing Armageddon. The Apostle Rufus also reveals that Jay entertains homosexual fantasies when masturbating. Jay reassures an uncomfortable Silent Bob, by explaining that he does not &#x27;always&#x27; think about men. During the journey, they also encounter Bartleby and Loki, and a host of demons who (in rebellion against Hell) are trying to help the angels cause the end of the world. Silent Bob also speaks, saying &quot;no ticket&quot; (a reference to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;) after throwing the rebel angels off a moving train, then being stared at by a speechless and concerned passenger.

Once at the church, Jay and Silent Bob, along with the others, try to stop the angels from entering. Loki has a change of heart and tries to help them out, but is killed by Bartleby. Though their efforts to fight Bartleby are unsuccessful (in fact, Jay accidentally helps Bartleby out by shooting his wings off with a MAC-10, turning him to a mortal), God (Alanis Morissette) arrives, and proceeds to set things in order. After Jay spouts an obscenity-filled tirade on Serendipity and Rufus, the movie ends with Jay suggesting that Silent Bob and he take Bethany to the Quick Stop.

The ending credits claim that Jay and Silent Bob would return in &quot;Clerks II&quot;.

===&quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001)===

&quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; takes place eight years after the events of &quot;Clerks&quot;. Due to their excessive disturbances, drug dealing and starting rumors about Dante and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) being a gay couple, Dante and Randal file a restraining order against Jay and Silent Bob. It prohibits them from coming within of the Quick Stop or RST Video for at least a year. Having no place to loiter, they decide to pay a visit to Brodie (Jason Lee), where they learn that Miramax Films is making a &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; film.

They visit Holden and ask for the money that belongs to them for using their likenesses in the film, only to find out that he sold his half of the rights to &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; to the other co-creator Banky Edwards (also Jason Lee); after Holden introduces them to the internet, they also discover that a number of people have bashed the upcoming film and insulted Jay and Silent Bob numerous times for alleged &quot;selling out&quot; to Miramax. Jay and Silent Bob decide that they must defend their honor, and embark on a road trip to Hollywood to stop the movie from being made and to protect their reputations, or at least get their money.

After being refused passage on a bus for not having tickets, they decide to hitch-hike there and stop at a local Mooby&#x27;s restaurant, whereupon Jay falls victim to love at first sight with Justice (Shannon Elizabeth), an international jewel thief posing as an animal rights activist. Justice offers them a ride under the pretense that they are traveling cross country to release animals from an animal-testing facility, much to the unhappiness of her partners Chrissy (Ali Larter), Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith), and Sissy (Eliza Dushku).

Once inside the facility, Jay and Silent Bob find a tranquilizer gun and the ape, an orangutan named Suzanne (a reference to the ending scene in &quot;Mallrats&quot;). After freeing her from her cage, Silent Bob becomes sympathetic for the other animals, so they let them loose, as well. In the meantime, the four women escape with the diamonds and place a bomb on the van; Jay and Silent Bob witness the van explode, and while assuming that Justice is dead, they manage to escape just as the authorities arrive.

Federal Wildlife Marshall Willenholly (Will Ferrell) arrives to take over the case, as it involves the release of animals. Suzanne is subsequently taken by the occupants of a car labeled &quot;Critters of Hollywood&quot;. Jay laments that they will never see Suzanne again, only to have Silent Bob angrily, and loudly, explain that the sign on the car (also calling Jay a dumbfuck for not getting what Silent Bob&#x27;s gesturing right after Suzanne was stolen was about) indicated that they will probably meet up with Suzanne in Hollywood.

They are eventually able to hitch a ride and make it to Hollywood. There, they evade a security guard (Diedrich Bader) and make their way through multiple movie sets, including &quot;Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season&quot;. They are reunited with Suzanne on the set of the then-fictional &quot;Scream 4&quot;, where Suzanne is playing the part of a masked killer.

Pursued by a group of security guards, they are able to escape by riding a bicycle over a ramp (a reference to the iconic E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial moon scene), propelling them through the window of a nearby building. By sheer luck, they land in the dressing room of James Van Der Beek (of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;) and Jason Biggs (of &quot;American Pie&quot;), who happen to be playing Jay and Silent Bob in &quot;The Bluntman and Chronic Movie&quot;; Silent Bob is appalled that his comic-book counterpart is being played by the &quot;pie fucker&quot;.

After learning this, Jay and Bob form a huddle in the corner and decide to beat up Biggs and Van Der Beek, but while their backs are turned, Suzanne does this for them. Jay and Silent Bob then give the ape the tranquilizer gun and set her loose in the ventilation ducts.

They put on the &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; outfits, so they will not be noticed, but are mistaken for Biggs and Van Der Beek, and are escorted to the set of the movie. Despite the fact that they do not know what they are doing, once on set, filming begins. Jay and Silent Bob battle with Bluntman and Chronic&#x27;s nemesis, Cockknocker (Mark Hamill), eventually cutting off his hand.

At this point, Justice enters the set to confess her love for Jay and admits her profession as a professional jewel thief; an unassuming Jay forgives her and they kiss. Willenholly reappears with a shotgun, soon followed by Missy, Chrissy, and Sissy. Justice and Sissy fight hand-to-hand, while Missy and Chrissy get into a gun battle with Willenholly.

During the chaos, Jay and Silent Bob locate Banky and demand their money. After Banky refuses on account of Miramax paying him a lot of money for the film, Silent Bob breaks his silence and explains why Banky can be sued if he does not heed to their demands. Banky finally agrees to give them half of whatever he makes from the movie.

After the fight, Willenholly stands up, believing he has killed Missy and Chrissy. Suzanne takes this opportunity to shoot him in the buttocks with a tranquilizer dart, incapacitating him; Justice uses the situation to her advantage and offers Willeholly an opportunity to get into the FBI by turning herself in along with Missy, Sissy, and Chrissy, as long as she gets a reduced sentence and the charges against Jay and Silent Bob are dropped. He agrees and Justice tells Jay to wait for her.

Banky approaches Jay and Silent Bob and tells them that they are now rich. Jay expresses his displeasure at the fact that, despite all of their efforts, they were still unable to stop the internet insults. They decide that the only way to achieve this, using their newfound wealth, is to visit and beat up everyone who had insulted them, including children and members of the clergy, to the tune of &quot;Kick Some Ass&quot; by Stroke 9.

The ending credits claim that Jay and Silent Bob &quot;have left the building&quot;.

===&quot;Clerks II&quot; (2006)===

Thirteen years after the events in &quot;Clerks&quot;, and five years after the events in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, Jay and Silent Bob are in their early 30s and have become devoutly sober Christians, prompted by an incident where they were arrested and forced to go to rehab.

Once out of rehab, they are clean, but continue to deal while trying to teach the word of God, in a manner similar to evangelists. In one scene, Jay even suggests to a couple of buyers that they should read the &quot;Holy Fucking&quot; Bible. The Quick Stop where Dante worked was burned in a fire due to Randal leaving the coffee pot on, and Randal and Dante moved over to the Mooby&#x27;s fast food restaurant. Jay and Silent Bob follow the two there.

At the beginning of the film, Jay expresses some disillusionment at being a drug dealer and weighs on other ideas of what to do in life. At one point during the movie, Jay, knowing boredom is the first step to relapse, dances to the song &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; by Q Lazzarus after Silent Bob puts the tape in the boom box. He parodies exactly the same dance done by Buffalo Bill in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, complete with the &quot;tuck&quot;, although it is alleged Jay has been doing this in real life before &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was released.

Near the end of the film, they are jailed with Dante, Elias (Trevor Fehrman), and Randal, for a party at which a donkey show is hired to celebrate Dante moving away. Jay and Silent Bob were charged for possession of drugs, which violated their probation. They bear witness to Dante and Randal&#x27;s fight in the jailhouse, but at first provide no meaningful help, with Silent Bob unable to come up with his usual wisdom and instead criticizing Jay for never contributing to a conversation. Randal wants to reopen the Quick Stop with Dante, but neither of the two has the money, so Jay and Silent Bob offer some of the &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; movie royalty money under the condition that the two are allowed to loiter outside the shop and that the police cannot be called to arrest them. After the Quick Stop is reopened, Jay and Silent Bob return to where they started so many years ago, and promptly restart the &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; routine.

===&quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob&#x27;s Super Groovy Cartoon Movie!&quot; (2013)===

After winning $10 million from a scratchcard they bought at the Quick Stop, Jay &amp; Silent Bob decide to become superheroes Bluntman and Chronic (a parody of Batman and Robin). They build a secret Fortress of Solitude beneath RST Video and acquire all the necessary gadgets and accessories to make them ideal crime-fighters. They also hire their own butler, Albert (a parody of Alfred Pennyworth).

Throughout their crime-fighting ordeals, they manage to accidentally create a few super-powered enemies of their own, who together form &quot;The League of Shitters&quot;. The League of Shitters consists of Lipstick Lesbian, Dickhead, NewsGroup, Cocknocker, and the Diddler. While at a ceremony in which Bluntman and Chronic are to be awarded the key to the city of Red Bank, The League of Shitters attack the dynamic duo and knock them unconscious. They then attempt to infiltrate the &quot;Bluntcave&quot;, resulting in the deaths of NewsGroup and Diddler (they are crushed by a wall that reveals the entrance to the hideout). Lipstick Lesbian mortally stabs Albert in the back and places Bluntman and Chronic into a giant bong that is slowly filling up with water. After leaving the heroes to die, the villains descend upon Red Bank, killing everyone in their path. Albert uses the last of his strength to free the heroes before dying.

Vowing to avenge Albert, Bluntman, and Chronic fly to Red Bank in the Blunt Jet to save the city from The League of Shitters&#x27; mayhem. An epic fight ensues in which Bluntman subdues Dickhead by tricking him into entering a gay bar and Chronic kills Cocknocker with a broken beer bottle. Lipstick Lesbian draws a gun and attempts to shoot Bluntman and Chronic, but they are miraculously saved by a new heroine, Bluntgirl. Bluntgirl defeats Lipstick Lesbian single-handedly and begins to show romantic interest in Bluntman. Chronic is jealous and expresses his desire for anal sex. Bluntgirl agrees to this, however, she penetrates Chronic with a dildo, much to Chronic&#x27;s distaste. Bluntgirl asks Bluntman if he&#x27;s ever experienced anything of the like, to which he replies, &quot;Yeah, when Ben Affleck played Daredevil.&quot;. During the credits, it is noted that &quot;Jay and Silent Bob will return in Clerks III.&quot;

After the credits, Jay and Silent Bob are visited by Stan Lee, who wishes to speak to them about the &quot;Avenger Initiative&quot;. Shortly after, they are all picked up by Doc Brown, who requests their help in getting back to the future.

===&quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot (2019)&quot;===

In the years after &quot;Clerks II&quot;, Jay and Silent Bob convert the former RST Video into a fake chicken sandwich shop, which they use as a front for an illegal marijuana dispensary. The film opens with them getting arrested, and subsequently lose a court case to Saban Films, who are making a new &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; film, &quot;Bluntman V Chronic&quot;. The two also learn they have lost their naming rights, and can no longer self-identify as &quot;Jay and Silent Bob&quot;.

Jay and Bob visit Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee), who tells them about the &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; reboot, which is being directed by Kevin Smith. The film is largely completed, but a major scene is to be shot at the annual fan convention &quot;Chronic-Con&quot; in Hollywood. Jay and Bob have three days to get to Los Angeles to stop the film from being completed and win back their identities. The two depart for California.

They arrive in Chicago, where Jay learns his former girlfriend Justice (Shannon Elizabeth) works as a local weatherperson. Jay and Bob visit Justice, who tells Jay he left her heartbroken by never visiting her in jail. She has since married and given birth to their love child, Millennium &quot;Milly&quot; Faulken (Harley Quinn Smith). She introduces Jay to their daughter and her best friend Soapy (Treshelle Edmond) but urges him to never reveal his identity to her.

Justice leaves for vacation, and Milly forces Jay to take her and Soapy to Hollywood with him and Bob. Milly drugs Jay and Bob with a strong edible, and they wake up on a highway in New Orleans, where they meet Milly&#x27;s two other friends, Jihad (Aparna Brielle) and Shan Yu (Alice Wen). They tell Jay that they want to visit Chronic-Con because Shan Yu is a huge fan of the first &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; film and it is her dream to attend Chronic-Con. They steal a van and drive to California. Milly admits to Jay that her bad behavior is attributed to her never knowing her father.

Jay and Bob are abandoned by the group and set off in search of the van. They find it in a vacant area, where the Ku Klux Klan have kidnapped the girls and are having a rally. Bob steals a Klan hood and passes himself off as the new Grand Dragon to distract them using Alec Baldwin&#x27;s speech from &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; while Jay rescues the girls. They throw a portable toilet at the Klansmen and flee.

The group makes it to Chronic-Con and sneaks in. Jay and Bob plan to ruin the shoot, while the girls want to be extras in the film to fulfill Shan Yu&#x27;s dream. They agree to part ways, with Jay hugging Milly and letting her know he is proud of her.

After attempting to sneak past a familiar security guard (Diedrich Bader), Jay and Bob are pursued throughout the con. They hide in an empty panel room where they are met by Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck), who has just finished recording a podcast with Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams). Holden has donated his sperm to Alyssa and her wife (Virginia Smith) so they may have a child, whom he helps co-parent. Holden tells Jay that fatherhood gave him a new purpose. This inspires Jay to abort their mission and be a father to Milly. Holden gives them VIP badges, which grants him and the girls access to the panel with Kevin Smith.

Noticing that Bob bears a resemblance to Smith, Milly sneaks backstage and knocks out Smith, giving Smith&#x27;s clothes to Bob as a disguise. They bring Milly and Shan Yu on stage to film the scene, but Shan Yu sees through their ruse and knocks Bob unconscious, bringing out the real Kevin Smith. Bob is thrown out of the hall and Shan Yu reveals herself to be a Russian spy, bent on destroying American pop culture conventions. Jay reveals to Milly that he is her father. Bob regains consciousness outside and steals a large metal &quot;Iron Bob&quot; suit that was to be used in the filming of the scene. Controlling the suit, Bob incites a riot at the panel and disarms Shan Yu and her henchmen.

After making their way back home, Jay shows Milly the Quick Stop and tells her the stories of his and Bob&#x27;s adventures, including meeting Justice. Dante Hicks (Brian O&#x27;Halloran) arrives to open Quick Stop and bemoans the fact that the steel shutters are once again jammed closed. Jay then reveals it has been him and Silent Bob doing it the whole time.

===&quot;Clerks III&quot; (2022)===

Sometime later, Jay and Silent Bob open another (legally this time) marijuana dispensary in the former RST Video, although they still deal outside the store for old time&#x27;s sake. The pair are recruited to appear as themselves in Randal&#x27;s film about their lives at the Quick Stop, and also join in as cinematographers. Silent Bob has the idea to shoot the film in black-and-white, arguing that it will hide the poor color in the store while also exemplifying a metaphor for corporate culture sapping the color out of their lives. Jay proves to be a self-conscious actor, refusing to dance in a pivotal scene until everyone present on their small film crew leaves, and having trouble delivering the lasagna Aesop in his story to Dante, prompting an exasperated Silent Bob to offer to take the line (all of these, of course, referencing actual incidents during the filming of the original &quot;Clerks&quot;).

While filming the &quot;salsa shark&quot; scene, Jay and Silent Bob film Dante&#x27;s outburst at first with interest, only to quietly turn off their equipment upon realizing they are witnessing an emotionally charged argument between him and Randal, which leads to Dante suffering a heart attack. They later help Randal distract the hospital staff so he can show Dante the final cut of the movie. After Dante&#x27;s death, they attend his funeral along with Milly, who later joins Quick Stop as an employee. When Blockchain (Austin Zajur) and Elias&#x27;s NFT is a hit, Jay and Silent Bob offer the two some marijuana to celebrate, before running off to fly a kite with them.

==Television==
===&quot;Clerks: The Animated Series&quot; (2000–2002)===

&quot;&quot; continues Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s adventures in front of the Quick Stop with Dante and Randal. In one episode, Jay and Silent Bob sell illegal fireworks instead of drugs. These events are not necessarily contiguous with events depicted elsewhere in the View Askewniverse. Silent Bob follows the film format and only speaks once during the episodes. In the show, it is revealed that Jay is 26 years old (a year younger than Dante and Randal), but still in the fourth grade, having been held back &quot;a lot&quot;.

In most of the episodes, Jay and Silent Bob have some public service announcement videos, where they talk about safety tips, science lessons, or magic tricks. When they introduce themselves to kids, Charles Barkley also appears, but is immediately shooed away by Jay. In the &quot;Science Sez&quot; skit, Barkley attempt to tell a kid the importance of science, when Jay and Silent Bob arrive and beat him up, reminding him that only they do the segments. Silent Bob is more vocal in these segments.

In the series&#x27; final episode &quot;The Last Episode Ever&quot;, Jay is revealed to be the show&#x27;s animator, as he constantly redraws the physical forms of Dante and Randal (similar to one of Bugs Bunny&#x27;s antics in &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;) toward the end of the episode.

==Comics==
===&quot;Clerks&quot; (1998)===

The two appear in many of the &quot;Clerks&quot; comics in supporting roles.
* In &quot;Clerks: The Comic Book&quot;, Jay and Silent Bob&#x27;s drug dealing is compromised by the recent popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures. In an attempt to strike up business, the two hijack a toy store delivery truck and drive it into a secret compound behind the store. The two sell the figures at extremely low prices, ruining their value.
* In &quot;Clerks The Holiday Special&quot;, the two are seen working for Santa Claus, who is working in the apartment in between the Quick Stop and RST Video. The duo works on the toy-making machines.
* In &quot;Clerks: The Lost Scene&quot;, the two are seen in the bookend segments of the comic, which parodied the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; comic books.

===&quot;Chasing Dogma&quot; (1998–1999)===

In between the events of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and &quot;Dogma&quot;, Jay and Silent Bob decide to go to be the &quot;blunt connection&quot; in Shermer, Illinois, (where most of John Hughes&#x27; films are set) because they believe that all the guys there are jerks and that there would be girls crawling all over them. They discover in Chicago that Shermer, Illinois, does not exist.

Since many of the events were reused in the 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, not all the events depicted here are necessarily continuous with those depicted elsewhere in the View Askewniverse.

==Video games==
===&quot;Jay and Silent Bob: Mall Brawl&quot;===
Interabang Entertainment and Spoony Bard Productions produced &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Mall Brawl&quot; as a Limited Run Games release for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was later announced that the game would be available on digital platforms. The 8-bit-style game, a tribute to 1980s beat &#x27;em up games, was released on May 7, 2020, on Steam and Nintendo Switch. PlayStation 4 also got a release from Limited Run Games that included the last patch known as the Arcade Edition. This patch also dropped to the Steam, Sony PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch versions of the game. The NES release is still the original unpatched release of the game.

===&quot;Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch&quot;===
In February 2016, Interabang announced the development of &quot;Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch&quot;, a beat &#x27;em up video game in the style of &quot;Castle Crashers&quot; featuring the title characters fighting through miscreants in the &quot;mall of purgatory&quot; down the street from the Quick Stop. In addition to combat, the game includes a means to use insults as finishing moves in combat. The game is being developed with input from Smith and considered part of the View Askewniverse. Interabang used the Fig crowdfunding to raise $400k to complete the title, which successfully raised over $435,000 at the completion of the campaign.

===&quot;Jay and Silent Bob VR&quot;===
In April 2018, Kevin Smith announced that he had signed a deal to make a live-action VR project for STX Entertainment&#x27;s virtual reality division, STXsureal.

===Other===

Randal&#x27;s Monday was the first video game of Nexus Game Studio. Even though Jeff Anderson voices Randal in the game and plays Randal in the Clerks films that this games Randal is not the Clerks films Randal and bears no relation to the View Askewniverse films.

Two mobile games featuring Jay and Silent Bob were released on IOS devices in 2012. One was titled &quot;Too Fat To Fly&quot;, in which Silent Bob is launched from a slingshot and must keep flying without hitting obstacles.

<doc id="99015" wikidata="Q950865" url="?curid=99015" title="Doctor Dolittle (1967 film)">
<text>Doctor Dolittle is a 1967 American musical fantasy film directed by Richard Fleischer and starring Rex Harrison, Samantha Eggar, Anthony Newley, and Richard Attenborough. It was adapted by Leslie Bricusse from the &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; novel series by Hugh Lofting, primarily &quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1920), &quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1922), and &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Circus&quot; (1924).

Various attempts to make a film based on Doctor Dolittle began as early as the 1920s. In the early 1960s, actress-turned-producer Helen Winston acquired the film rights, but did not succeed in producing a film. In 1963, producer Arthur P. Jacobs acquired the rights and recruited Alan Jay Lerner to compose songs and Rex Harrison to star in the project. After numerous delays, Lerner was fired and replaced by Bricusse. In addition to the numerous technical difficulties inherent to working with the large number of animals required for the story, the production was impacted by numerous setbacks stemming from poorly chosen shooting locations and creative demands from Harrison, and the finished film cost almost three times more than its original budget of $6 million.

The film premiered in London on December 12, 1967. It recouped $9 million during its theatrical run, earning only $6.2 million in theatrical rentals and becoming a box-office bomb. Although the film received negative critical reviews, it was nominated for nine Oscars, including Best Picture, at the 40th Academy Awards, thanks to intense lobbying by 20th Century-Fox, and won Best Original Song and Best Visual Effects. Over time, the film has become a cult classic.

==Plot==
In 1845, in the small port town of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh, England, Matthew Mugg brings his young friend Tommy Stubbins with him when he takes an injured duck to his friend, the eccentric Doctor John Dolittle, who he claims is the best veterinarian in the world because he can talk to animals. A former medical doctor, Dolittle lives with a large menagerie of various creatures, including a talking blue-and-yellow macaw named Polynesia, a chimpanzee named Chee-Chee, a dog named Jip, and a piglet named Gub-Gub. He explains that the many animals he kept in his home created havoc with his human patients who began to go elsewhere for their medical needs, so his sister Sarah who served as his housekeeper demanded that he dispose of the animals or she would leave. He chose the animals. Polynesia then revealed that she could speak over 2,000 animal languages and offered to teach Dolittle so he could become an animal doctor. Dolittle says he can now speak nearly 500 animal languages and he is currently in the process of learning how to speak with sea creatures for an upcoming expedition to search for the legendary Great Pink Sea Snail.

The next morning, Dolittle is treating a horse for near-sightedness when the horse&#x27;s owner, the local magistrate General Bellowes, bursts in and accuses him of stealing the animal. Bellowes ends up getting chased away by skunks and his niece Emma Fairfax chides Dolittle for his rudeness and lack of compassion for humans. Dolittle expresses his contempt for her uncle, who hunts foxes, and for her, who, he says, does absolutely nothing, and she storms off.

To help Dolittle earn money for his expedition, a friend sends him a rare pushmi-pullyu, which is a creature that looks like a llama with a head on each end of its body and that likes to dance. Dolittle takes the pushmi-pullyu to a nearby circus run by Albert Blossom, and it becomes the star attraction. The doctor talks with a sad seal named Sophie and learns she longs to return to her husband at the North Pole, so he smuggles her out of the circus, disguises her in women&#x27;s clothing to convey her to the coast, and throws her in the ocean. Some fishermen witness this and have Dolittle arrested for murder.

When he appears in court before Bellowes, Dolittle is able to prove he can converse with animals by talking with Bellowes&#x27;s dog and revealing details only Bellowes and the dog could know. Certain he will be set free, he tells Matthew to get ready to begin their expedition the next day. While he is acquitted on the murder charge, the vindictive Bellowes orders him committed to an insane asylum.

Polynesia engineers Dolittle&#x27;s escape during his transfer to the asylum by obtaining the cooperation of the police horses and dogs. Dolittle, Matthew, Tommy, Polynesia, Chee-Chee, and Jip set sail in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail. Dolittle is surprised to discover Emma, who has become fascinated by him and is seeking adventure, is also on board his ship the &quot;Flounder&quot;. As he will be arrested if he turns back, he agrees to let her be his cook and cabin boy. It is decided by randomly pointing at a map that the crew will search for the Snail on Sea Star Island which is a floating island that is probably currently somewhere off the western coast of Africa. Assisted by various sea creatures, they near the Sea Star Island where they encounter a violent storm and the &quot;Flounder&quot; is destroyed.

Everyone washes ashore on Sea Star Island and Dolittle and Emma admit they have grown to like each other. The party is soon captured by the island&#x27;s natives who they learn are highly-educated and cultured from reading books that have washed ashore after innumerable shipwrecks and often name their children after their favorite authors. Their chieftain is William &quot;Willie&quot; Shakespeare the Tenth who explains that his tribe blames newcomers for its misfortunes, and the tropical island is currently drifting north into colder waters, which has given all of the animals colds.

Dolittle tends to the animals and then persuades a whale to push the island south. The jolt causes a large balancing rock to drop into a volcano, condemning Dolittle and his friends to die of 1,000 screams. Just as they are about to be killed, the island collides with Africa and the two pieces fit perfectly, confirming a legend that Sea Star Island had broken off from Africa 5,000 years earlier. For bringing them home, the natives cancel the execution and revere Dolittle as a god.

A loud sneeze alerts Dolittle to the presence of the Great Pink Sea Snail which lives in a cave on the island. In exchange for curing its cold, the Great Pink Sea Snail agrees to carry Dolittle&#x27;s friends back to Britain in its watertight shell as it wants to visit its cousin the Loch Ness Monster anyway. Emma wishes to stay on the island with Dolittle and search for the Giant Lunar Moth, a creature that flies back and forth between Earth and the Moon, but he says he is not good with people so she says she will miss him and kisses him goodbye.

Sometime later, Sophie and her husband bring Dolittle the news that Bellowes has agreed to pardon him after all of the animals in England went on strike to protest his sentence. Having realized that he has feelings for Emma, Dolittle has the natives position themselves in the shape of the Giant Lunar Moth. Later that night, Dolittle rides the Giant Lunar Moth back to Puddleby.

==Production==
===Development===
As early as 1922, Fox Film Corporation made Hugh Lofting an offer for the film rights to Doctor Dolittle. Decades later, Walt Disney sought to obtain the rights to make a film adaptation of the novels. The Disney studio offered Lofting a flat fee of $7,500 for the ancillary rights to the property, and the contract negotiations reached an impasse. In 1960, Lofting&#x27;s widow Josephine gave a short-term option of the film rights to Helen Winston, a Canadian actress who had produced the film &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; (1960). 20th Century Fox signed a multi-picture production deal with Winston&#x27;s company, Luster Enterprises, in April 1962, with plans to commence production in the following months. Winston had actor George Gobel in mind to portray Doctor Dolittle in the project. She had completed a script with writer Larry Watkin by June 1962, but Fox decided to cancel their option two months later.

Arthur P. Jacobs first heard that the film rights were available on December 5, 1963, which was before the release of &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; (1964), his debut film as a producer. Jacobs met with the Loftings&#x27; attorney, Bernard Silbert, and expressed his intentions to produce &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; as a musical with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner and actor Rex Harrison attached. He acquired the rights on Christmas Day, with the condition that he find a distributor within six months. In January 1964, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Lerner had signed on to write the script and compose the songs. That March, Jacobs pitched his project to studio executive Darryl Zanuck, and 20th Century Fox signed on as the distributor. On March 22, Rex Harrison signed to star as Doctor Dolittle. Because Lerner&#x27;s collaborator Frederick Loewe had retired, Jacobs hired André Previn to compose the musical score. The film was given a budget of $6 million.

After not producing a complete draft of the screenplay in over a year, Lerner, who was more focused at the time on his work on the Broadway musical &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, was fired from the &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; project on May 7, 1965. Jacobs considered replacing Lerner with the Sherman Brothers, who had just won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for their work on &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), but they were still under contract to Disney, so he hired Leslie Bricusse, who was in high demand after his success with the stage musical &quot;Stop the World – I Want to Get Off&quot;. Determined to make a good impression for his first screenplay commission, Bricusse proved agreeably productive from the start for Jacobs, suggesting numerous story ideas and adding a female leading character to the film during their first meeting on May 6. Zanuck decided to give Bricusse a trial run, at first only hiring him to complete two songs and the first twenty pages of a script. Two weeks after he was brought on to the project, Bricusse presented the song &quot;Talk to the Animals&quot;, which he composed especially for Harrison. By July, Bricusse had written a full script, including various song suggestions, that effectively blunted the book&#x27;s racist content, and his adaptation received the approval of Josephine Lofting.

For the director, Vincente Minnelli was initially attached to the project, but left before Bricusse was hired. William Wyler, George Roy Hill, and John Huston were considered, but Richard Zanuck settled on Richard Fleischer.

===Casting===
Lerner&#x27;s replacement by Bricusse gave Harrison the option of sitting out his contract, which gave him unusual leverage over the film. Sammy Davis Jr. was hired to play the character of Prince Bumpo, but Harrison demanded that Davis be fired from the project, as he wanted to work with &quot;a real actor, not a song-and-dance man&quot;. Instead, Harrison suggested Sidney Poitier, despite the fact that Poitier was not a musical performer. Jacobs and Fleischer flew to New York to meet with Poitier, who accepted the part on condition that he meet with and approve of Bricusse. The producer and director then met with Davis to inform him that he would be released from his contract and, angered at the casting change, Davis threatened to go public and sue Harrison. Poitier considered leaving the project the next day, as he did not want to betray Davis, but he eventually decided to stay in the role. Just before shooting was set to commence, Fleischer and Zanuck reduced Bumpo&#x27;s role, which had been drastically increased after Poitier was cast, in order to save money, and they informed Poitier that he would be released from his contract before he started filming his scenes. Geoffrey Holder was cast as his replacement in the renamed role of William Shakespeare X.

For the role of Matthew, Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye were among those on the shortlist, but Bricusse&#x27;s sometime-songwriting partner Anthony Newley was ultimately cast, which angered Harrison, who had suggested David Wayne. Harrison later showed contempt for Bricusse&#x27;s script and lyrics and demanded to sing live on set, rather than lip-syncing to pre-recorded tracks, and he left the project at one point. After considering Peter Ustinov, Alec Guinness, and Peter O&#x27;Toole to replace Harrison, Christopher Plummer was cast as Doctor Dolittle. When Harrison agreed to stay, the producers paid Plummer his entire agreed-upon salary to leave the production.

Harrison suggested Maggie Smith, his co-star in &quot;The Honey Pot&quot; (1967), for the role of Emma Fairfax. Barbra Streisand and Hayley Mills were approached, but salary negotiations broke down (Mills later claimed she pulled out because her sister Juliet wanted the role), and Samantha Eggar was cast. Eggar&#x27;s singing voice was overdubbed by Diana Lee, the daughter of playback singer Bill Lee.

===Filming===
In June 1966, principal photography was underway, with the scenes that take place in the fictional village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh being shot in Castle Combe, Wiltshire. All signs of modern life in Castle Combe, such as cars, television antennas, and Coca-Cola promotional signs, were removed or hidden, which irritated the locals, and, in an attempt to raise publicity for how the village was being treated, British Army officer (and future explorer) Ranulph Fiennes even attempted to blow up a concrete dam built by the production to block a stream. Additionally, the filmmakers did not realize that the animals trained for the production would be quarantined upon entering the United Kingdom, and, at considerable expense, they had to replace the animals to meet production deadlines. The producers ignored reports of the area&#x27;s frequently rainy summers, and the weather continually interfered with shooting and caused health problems for the animals. As if that were not enough, Richard Attenborough was hired to replace Hugh Griffith in the role of Albert Blossom during the shoot. Production costs soared to $15 million.

In October, the shoot moved to Marigot Bay in Saint Lucia. This location had its own issues, and problems related to insects and frequent tropical storms delayed filming and left eight crew members bedridden due to vomiting, diarrhea, and high fever. The Great Pink Sea Snail proved to be problematic not only because of its poor design, but also due to the fact that the island&#x27;s children had recently been struck by a gastrointestinal epidemic caused by freshwater snails; mobs of angry locals threw rocks at the large prop. Within a month, the film had fallen 39 days behind schedule, and the production crew had to decamp back to California.

After reconstructing the sets on the Fox studio lot in California, the production budget reached $17 million. Four months later, after principal photography was complete, Harrison insisted on re-recording his songs live on set. This infuriated conductor Lionel Newman, but he gave in to Harrison&#x27;s demands, even though it meant more work for him, since the orchestral arrangements had to be added later. Filming was finished by April 1967.

====Personality conflicts====

Personality conflicts added to the tension on the set. Anthony Newley was incensed by comments made by Harrison that he deemed antisemitic. Harrison was apparently jealous of his Jewish co-star&#x27;s participation in the project, and he demanded Newley&#x27;s role be reduced and would disrupt scenes featuring Newley. Geoffrey Holder received racist abuse from Harrison&#x27;s entourage. The younger cast members grew to loathe Harrison for this abuse, and they retaliated by antagonizing him.

====Animal issues====
Over 1,200 live animals were used in the film, all of which required understudies. There are anecdotes of a goat eating Fleischer&#x27;s script, and a parrot that learned to yell &quot;cut&quot;. At one point, ducks were placed in a lake, but did not have their water-repellent feathers, as it was the wrong time of year, so they began to sink, and crew members had to jump in the water to save them. Animals also bit and defecated on the cast and crew, including Harrison.

==Post-production==
The film&#x27;s first test screening took place in September 1967 at the Mann Theatre in Minneapolis, and it was a failure. The audience consisted mainly of adults, who were not the primary target audience, and the general response during the screening was muted. Comment cards rated the film poorly, with frequent complaints about the length, so, in an attempt to improve the pacing, several verses were dropped from the songs, including &quot;Beautiful Things&quot;, and the song &quot;Where Are the Words?&quot; was removed before the film was screened again in San Francisco. The shorter edit screened to a younger audience in a different city was no more successful, so additional edits were made, including the removal of the song &quot;Something in Your Smile&quot;, before the film was screened in San Jose, California. This version of the film, which ran 151 minutes, was received well enough to be approved as the final cut.

In October, as the film&#x27;s release date approached, Helen Winston sued 20th Century Fox for $4.5 million alleging that the plot point about animals threatening to go on strike on Dolittle&#x27;s behalf was plagiarized from her screenplay. As Bricusse had read Winston&#x27;s script and, assuming this idea was from one of Lofting&#x27;s books, included it in his treatment, the producers had no legal defense and were forced to settle out of court. The animal strike is mentioned at the end of the movie, but was not actually filmed.

==Music==
The lyrics and music for &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; were composed by Leslie Bricusse, and the music was scored and conducted by Lionel Newman and Alexander Courage. In the original cut of the film, Dolittle and Emma eventually begin a relationship, and he sings a song titled &quot;Where Are the Words?&quot; when he realizes he is falling in love with her. In a revised version, Matthew falls for Emma and sings the song, and, although the song was deleted from the film before its release, Newley&#x27;s recording of the song is featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. The footage of both Harrison and Newley performing the song, as well as Harrison&#x27;s vocal track, are lost. Another song deleted from the film is titled &quot;Something in Your Smile&quot;, which was sung by Dolittle while writing a letter to Emma after she has returned to England. The footage of this scene is lost, but Harrison&#x27;s vocal track survives.

There was an enormous media blitz surrounding the release of the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, and half a million copies of the mono and stereo LP were shipped to retail stores four months before the premiere of the film. The song &quot;Talk to the Animals&quot; was recorded by such artists as Bobby Darin, Andy Williams, Tony Bennett, Dizzy Gillespie, Jack Jones, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass and Andre Kostelanetz. Sammy Davis Jr., who had been dropped from the film, recorded an entire album of music from the film. &quot;Bobby Darin Sings Doctor Dolittle&quot; was released on Atlantic Records in August 1967, and Darin&#x27;s recording of &quot;Beautiful Things&quot; from this LP was featured in a 2013 TV commercial for Etihad Airways. A cover version of the same song by the Shiny Lapel Trio was used in a 2008 Christmas television commercial campaign for the United States retail chain Kohl&#x27;s.

In November 2017, a 50th Anniversary Expanded Soundtrack was released by La-La Land Records as a lavish 2-CD set that included numerous demos, rehearsal takes, and alternative versions of songs from the film.

==Release==
The film had its official Royal World Charity Premiere on December 12, 1967, at the Odeon Marble Arch in London, with Queen Elizabeth II in attendance. On December 19, it had a reserved-seating premiere at the Loew&#x27;s State Theatre in New York City. Two days later, the film opened at the Paramount Theatre in Los Angeles as a benefit for the Motion Picture Relief Fund.

===Marketing===
Thirteen months before the release of the film, Fox began an extensive marketing campaign to promote it. On September 30, 1966, the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine featured a picture of Harrison, in character as Doctor Dolittle, riding a giraffe, and inside there was an article documenting the film&#x27;s production. The release was accompanied by 50 licensees ready to spend $12 million in advertising, and the 300 different promotional items related to the film were carried by 10,000 retail stores, totaling an estimated retail value of $200 million.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
Reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther said: &quot;The music is not exceptional, the rendering of the songs lacks variety, and the pace, under Richard Fleischer&#x27;s direction, is slow and without surprise.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claimed that &quot;&quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;, though it is beautiful, often funny, often charming, tuneful and gay, is in an odd way never really sentimentally moving, even in the sense that it sets up in us elders a yearning for lost youth. It is a picture we can greatly enjoy seeing our children enjoy, but without feeling quite at one with them.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Somehow—with the frequent but by no means infallible exception of Walt Disney—Hollywood has never learned what so many children&#x27;s book writers have known all along: size and a big budget are no substitutes for originality and charm.&quot; Robert B. Frederick of &quot;Variety&quot; acknowledged the film as an &quot;imperfect gem&quot;, but felt &quot;there&#x27;s sufficient values going for it to survive any barbs aimed at it by the critics&quot;.

Retrospectively, in his annual &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, critic and film historian Leonard Maltin admired the film&#x27;s photography, but called it a &quot;colossal musical dud that almost ruined 20th Century-Fox studios.&quot; He concluded by admitting that &quot;The movie has one merit: if you have unruly children, it may put them to sleep.&quot; On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 29% based on 21 reviews, with an average score of 4.3/10. On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

===Box office===
The film faced strong competition at the box office from Disney&#x27;s animated feature film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, which had opened to considerable critical and audience acclaim two months earlier and was still in wide release. &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;″s appeal as family fare was undermined when the press drew attention to allegedly racist content in Lofting&#x27;s books, prompting demands to have them removed from school libraries.

According to studio records, the film needed to earn $31,275,000 in rentals to break even, and by December 1970 it had only made $16.3 million. In September 1970, Fox estimated it had lost $11,141,000 on the film.

==Accolades==
20th Century-Fox&#x27;s decision to mount an Oscar campaign for the film was partially due to their lackluster slate of releases during the holiday season in 1967, while a major commercial success, &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, had received a less-than-stellar critical reception. Encouraged by the success of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, and Fox&#x27;s own &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; at the Academy Awards in 1965 and 1966, Fox and other major film studios in Hollywood aimed to replicate this success by launching extravagant Oscar campaigns for their musical films. Around that time, Warner Bros. Pictures, Walt Disney Productions, and Universal Pictures have mounted similar campaigns for their respective musical films released in 1967: &quot;Camelot&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, and &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;. As a result, in January and February 1968, Fox booked 16 consecutive nights of free screenings of &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; on the studio lot for members of the Academy, complete with dinner and champagne. Thanks to the studio&#x27;s efforts, the film received nine Academy Award nominations.

The film was recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Talk to the Animals&quot; – Nominated

==Stage adaptation==

In 1998, the film was adapted into a stage musical. The show, which was, at the time, one of the most expensive stage musicals ever produced, ran for 400 performances in London&#x27;s West End. It starred Phillip Schofield as Doctor Dolittle and Bryan Smyth as Matthew, and featured a pre-recorded Julie Andrews as the voice of Dolittle&#x27;s parrot Polynesia and the animatronics of Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop.

<doc id="99017" wikidata="Q1483458" url="?curid=99017" title="Oliver!">
<text>Oliver! is a stage musical, with book, music and lyrics by Lionel Bart. The musical is based upon the 1838 novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; by Charles Dickens.

It premiered at the Wimbledon Theatre, southwest London in 1960 before opening in the West End, where it enjoyed a record-breaking long run. &quot;Oliver!&quot; ran on Broadway, after being brought to the U.S. by producer David Merrick in 1963. Major London revivals played from 1977 to 1980, 1994 to 1998, 2008 to 2011 and on tour in the UK from 2011 to 2013. Additionally, its 1968 film adaptation, directed by Carol Reed, won six Academy Awards including Best Picture.

&quot;Oliver!&quot; received thousands of performances in British schools, becoming one of the most popular school musicals. In 1963 Lionel Bart received the Tony Award for Best Original Score. Many songs are well known to the public, such as &quot;Food, Glorious Food&quot;, &quot;Consider Yourself&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Oliver!&quot; was the first musical adaptation of a famous Charles Dickens work to become a stage hit. There had been two previous Dickens musicals in the 1950s, both of them television adaptations of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. The plot of Dickens&#x27;s original novel is considerably simplified for the purposes of the musical, with Fagin being represented more as a comic character than as a villain, and large portions of the latter part of the story being completely left out. Although Dickens&#x27;s novel has been called antisemitic in its portrayal of the Jewish Fagin as evil, the production by Bart (himself Jewish) was more sympathetic and featured many Jewish actors in leading roles: Ron Moody (Ronald Moodnick), Georgia Brown (Lilian Klot), and Martin Horsey.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

The musical opens in the workhouse, as the half-starved orphan boys are entering the enormous dining hall for supper. They are fed only gruel, but find some solace by imagining a richer menu (&quot;Food Glorious Food&quot;). Oliver gathers up the courage to ask for more, and is immediately apprehended by parish beadle Mr. Bumble and the Widow Corney, the heartless and greedy caretakers of the workhouse (&quot;Oliver!&quot;). Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney are left alone, and Mr. Bumble begins to make amorous advances (&quot;I Shall Scream!&quot;). Mrs. Corney pretends to resent his attentions, but ends up on Mr. Bumble&#x27;s lap, as he eventually proposes to her. Mr. Bumble then takes Oliver and sells him as an apprentice to an undertaker, Mr. Sowerberry (&quot;Boy for Sale&quot;). Mr. Sowerberry and his wife taunt Oliver and Mr. Bumble (&quot;That&#x27;s Your Funeral&quot;), causing Mr. Bumble to become angry and storm out. Oliver is sent to sleep in the basement with the coffins (&quot;Where Is Love?&quot;).

The next morning, Noah Claypole, another employee of Mr. Sowerberry, insults Oliver&#x27;s dead mother, whereupon Oliver begins pummeling him. Mrs. Sowerberry and her daughter, Charlotte, who is also Noah&#x27;s girlfriend, run in. The three lock Oliver inside a coffin, and Mr. Bumble is sent for. The entrance of an intoxicated Mr. Sowerberry doesn&#x27;t aid matters, and during all the commotion Oliver escapes. After a week on the run, he ends up in the city of London and meets a boy about 16 years old known as the Artful Dodger. Dodger seems a kindly boy, and welcomes Oliver to join him and his friends (&quot;Consider Yourself&quot;). Dodger is, unknown to Oliver, a pickpocket, and invites Oliver to come and live in Fagin&#x27;s lair. Fagin is a veteran criminal &quot;fence&quot; who sends out young boys as pickpockets. Oliver is completely unaware of any criminality and believes that the boys make handkerchiefs rather than steal them. Oliver is introduced to Fagin and his boys and taught their ways (&quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Pick a Pocket or Two&quot;).

The next day, Oliver meets Nancy, an older member of Fagin&#x27;s gang and the girlfriend of Fagin&#x27;s terrifying associate Bill Sikes, a brutal house-burglar whose abuse she endures because she loves him. Nancy, along with her good friend Bet and the boys sing about how they mostly like their unconventional if dangerous lifestyle (&quot;It&#x27;s a Fine Life&quot;). Oliver bows deeply to Nancy and Bet, trying to be polite. All the boys laugh and mimic Oliver. Nancy singles out Dodger to demonstrate the way the rich people treat each other (&quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;). Nancy and Bet leave, and Oliver is sent out with the other boys on his first pickpocketing job (&quot;Be Back Soon&quot;). Fagin tells Oliver to go with Dodger and another boy named Charley Bates, but when Dodger and Charley steal a handkerchief from Mr. Brownlow, a wealthy old man, they run off, leaving the horrified Oliver to be arrested for the crime (&quot;The Robbery&quot;).

===Act II===
In the Three Cripples pub, at the request of boisterous customers, Nancy strikes up an old tavern song with the low-life ruffians, (&quot;Oom-Pah-Pah&quot;). Bill Sikes makes his first appearance and disperses the crowd (&quot;My Name&quot;). Dodger runs in and tells Fagin about Oliver&#x27;s capture and removal to the Brownlow household. Worried that Oliver will &quot;blow upon them&quot; (i.e. betray the gang to the authorities), Fagin and Bill decide to abduct Oliver and bring him back to the den, with Nancy&#x27;s help. Nancy, who has come to care for Oliver, at first refuses to help, but Bill physically abuses her and forces her into obedience. In spite of this, Nancy still loves Bill and believes he loves her too (&quot;As Long as He Needs Me&quot;).

The next morning, at Mr. Brownlow&#x27;s house in Bloomsbury, Mrs. Bedwin, the housekeeper, sings to Oliver (&quot;Where Is Love? [Reprise]&quot;), and Oliver wakes up as street-sellers begin their day&#x27;s work outside (&quot;Who Will Buy?&quot;). Mr. Brownlow and Dr. Grimwig decide that Oliver is well enough to go outside, so Brownlow sends Oliver to return some books to the bookseller. Oliver sees a group of street vendors and joins them in song (&quot;Who Will Buy? [Reprise]&quot;). As the vendors leave, Nancy and Bill appear and grab Oliver. They bring him back to Fagin&#x27;s den, where Nancy saves Oliver from a beating from Sikes after the boy tries to flee. Nancy remorsefully reviews their dreadful life, but Bill maintains that any living is better than none while Fagin tries to smooth things over (&quot;It&#x27;s A Fine Life [Reprise]&quot;). Left alone, Fagin ponders his current existence and possible life changes (&quot;Reviewing the Situation&quot;); however, after thinking of various excuses, he elects to stay just as he is.

Back at the workhouse, Mr. Bumble and the Widow Corney, now unhappily married, are told by the dying pauper Old Sally that Oliver&#x27;s mother, Agnes, left a gold locket when she died in childbirth. Old Sally had stolen the locket, which she gives to the Widow Corney before she dies. Mr. and Mrs. Bumble realize that Oliver may have wealthy relatives (&quot;Oliver! [Reprise]&quot;) and visit Mr. Brownlow (who has advertised for news of Oliver), hoping to profit from any reward given for information . Mr. Brownlow realizes they are not interested in Oliver&#x27;s welfare but only money and throws them out. Recognizing the picture inside the locket as a picture of his daughter, he realizes that Oliver is actually his grandson.

Nancy visits Mr. Brownlow, explains how she and Bill abducted Oliver, and remorsefully promises to deliver Oliver to him safely that night on London Bridge but refuses to give up her fellow gang members. She ponders again about Bill (&quot;As Long as He Needs Me [Reprise]&quot;). Suspecting Nancy, Bill follows her as she sneaks Oliver out of Fagin&#x27;s den. At London Bridge, he confronts them and viciously clubs Nancy to death. He then grabs Oliver and runs off. Mr. Brownlow arrives and discovers Nancy&#x27;s body. A large crowd forms, among them the distraught Bet. Bullseye, Bill&#x27;s terrier, turns on his master and returns to the scene of the crime, and the crowd prepares to follow him. After Sikes brings Oliver to Fagin&#x27;s hideout looking for aid, Fagin and his boys flee in panic. The constables break in, and Dodger is arrested before he can escape. Not finding Bill at the hideout, the crowd returns to the Thames Embankment. Bill appears at the top of the bridge, holding Oliver as hostage and threatening to kill him. When a memory of the dead Nancy freezes Sikes, two policemen sneak up on him, and one of them shoots Bill while the other grabs Oliver. After Oliver is reunited with Mr. Brownlow, the mob disperses. Fagin appears and decides that the time has never looked better for him to straighten out his life (&quot;Reviewing the Situation [Reprise]&quot;).

==Production history==

===Original London production===
&quot;Oliver!&quot; premiered at the Wimbledon Theatre for a preliminary engagement before opening at the New Theatre (now the Noël Coward Theatre, formerly the Albery) on 30 June 1960 and ran for 2,618 performances, a record for a musical in London at the time. Directed by Peter Coe, the choreographer was Malcolm Clare and costumes and scenery were by Sean Kenny. The original cast featured Ron Moody as Fagin, Georgia Brown as Nancy, and Barry Humphries in the supporting role of Mr. Sowerberry, the undertaker. Keith Hamshere (the original Oliver) is now a Hollywood still photographer; Martin Horsey (the original Artful Dodger) worked as an actor/director and authored the play &quot;L&#x27;Chaim&quot;. Other boys who alternated in the juvenile leads included Phil Collins, Leonard Whiting and Davy Jones as the Artful Dodger. The cast also included Tony Robinson as one of the Workhouse boys/Fagin&#x27;s Gang, and John Bluthal as Fagin. Former professional boxer Danny Sewell was the original Bill Sikes and remained in the role (including the original Broadway and US touring productions) for almost six years. Steve Marriott played workhouse boys including The Artful Dodger, and he is featured on the original soundtrack LP. Michael Cashman played the role of Oliver during his time in the production.

Sid James turned down the part of Fagin as the timing of the production coincided with his own attempts to move away from the shady and roguish roles for which he was well known.

===Original Broadway production===

David Merrick brought &quot;Oliver!&quot; to the Broadway stage, where it premiered at the Imperial Theatre on 6 January 1963. It closed on 14 November 1964, after 774 performances. The cast featured child actor Bruce Prochnik in the title role alongside Georgia Brown, Danny Sewell and Barry Humphries, reprising their West End roles as Nancy, Bill Sikes and Mr. Sowerberry, respectively, and Clive Revill as Fagin, replacing Ron Moody. The national tour and cast recording featured Michael Goodman as The Artful Dodger, but on Broadway the role was played by future Monkee Davy Jones, another veteran of the London production. The Broadway production was a critical success and received ten Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, Best Actor in a Musical, Best Actress in a Musical and Best Featured Actor in a Musical. It won the awards for Best Scenic Design, Best Original Score and Best Music Direction. The Broadway production was revived shortly after the original production closed. The revival opened in 1965 and was directed by Peter Coe. It ran at the Martin Beck Theatre for 64 performances, featuring Victor Stiles as Oliver, Robin Ramsay as Fagin, Maura K. Wedge as Nancy, Joey Baio as The Artful Dodger, Dominic Chianese as Mr. Sowerberry, Alan Crofoot as Mr. Bumble, Danny Sewell as Bill Sikes, Bram Nossen as Mr. Brownlow, and Dodi Protero as Mrs. Bedwin. The cast recording was done in Los Angeles in advance of its New York opening.

Georgia Brown, Davy Jones, Ronnie Kroll, Joan Lombardo, and Robin Ramsay appeared performing two musical numbers from &quot;Oliver!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; and the Act II reprise of &quot;As Long as He Needs Me&quot;) on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on the evening of 9 February 1964, the same evening that the Beatles made their first U.S. television appearance on that show.

===1967 and 1977 London revivals===
A revival opened in April 1967 at the Piccadilly Theatre, starring Paul Bartlett as the title character and Barry Humphries as Fagin, with Marti Webb as Nancy, running for 331 performances. It was directed by David Phethean, produced by Donald Albery, with sets by Sean Kenney.

Cameron Mackintosh produced a revival opening on 21 December 1977 at the Albery Theatre (the renamed New Theatre; now the Noël Coward Theatre), starring Roy Hudd as Fagin (later replaced by Roy Dotrice and then George Layton,) and ran until 20 September 1980, following a three-week try-out at the Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham from 6 September 1977. This production was totally faithful to the 1960 original version, using Sean Kenny&#x27;s set. The original production&#x27;s sepia background painted on the rear stage wall was still extant.

===1983 London and Broadway revivals===
Mackintosh was asked to revive the show yet again in 1983 for a limited five-week Christmas season at the Aldwych Theatre, directed by Peter Coe. Ron Moody returned as Fagin, with Jackie Marks as Nancy, Linal Haft as Bill Sikes, Meg Johnson as Mrs Corney, Peter Bayliss as Mr. Bumble, and Geoffrey Toone as Mr Brownlow. Oliver was played by Anthony Pearson and the Artful Dodger by David Garlick. The original Sean Kenny sets were used. The last professional production to use Sean Kenny&#x27;s original stage design was at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch, Essex, in 1986. This production starred Victor Spinetti as Fagin.

The 1983 London revival of &quot;Oliver!&quot; transferred to Broadway in 1984. It opened at the Mark Hellinger Theatre and ran from 29 April 1984 through 13 May 1984, for 17 performances and 13 previews. Ron Moody reprised the role of Fagin and Patti LuPone played Nancy. David Garlick reprised his West End performance as The Artful Dodger, the first British youngster to appear on Broadway since Davy Jones, creating the Equity Exchange Program in the process. The original creative staff were used for this production, including director Peter Coe. For this production, the song &quot;I Shall Scream&quot; was eliminated.

LuPone, in her memoirs, said that the production should have run longer, noting that this production utilized the original sets, costumes, blocking (staging), and direction, and commented: &quot;Hmm...maybe &#x27;that&#x27; was the problem&quot;. Moody was nominated for a Tony Award despite the short run. The show only received one negative review; it was from Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; who called the production &quot;likely to hold the attention of only the youngest and most obedient children&quot; and &quot;just dull&quot;. It prompted one of the main backers to pull out. The positive reviews were quoted in the ad for the show, including a Clive Barnes quote: &quot;&quot;Oliver!&quot; is glorious food for Broadway&quot;.

LuPone had asked the show&#x27;s Musical Director to change her keys because they were too low for her, but was told she could not. She wrote that she &quot;had major battles with the musical director&quot;, one concerning the term &quot;vamp&quot;; &quot;he never waited for me to finish my dialogue.&quot;

===1994 London revival===
Cameron Mackintosh produced another revival of the show which opened at the London Palladium in the West End on 8 December 1994. The production team included a young Sam Mendes as director, with Anthony Ward as designer, Matthew Bourne as choreographer, Martin Koch as music supervisor and William David Brohn as orchestrator. The cast included Jonathan Pryce (after much persuasion) as Fagin, Sally Dexter as Nancy, Miles Anderson as Bill Sikes, James Villiers as Mr. Brownlow, James Saxon as Mr. Bumble, Jenny Galloway as Widow Corney, David Delve as Mr. Sowerberry and Julia Deakin as Mrs. Sowerberry. The role of Oliver was played by numerous child actors during the run of four years, including Gregory Bradley, Ben Reynolds, Jon Lee, Steven Webb, James Bourne, Simon Schofield, James Rowntree and Tom Fletcher, while the Artful Dodger was played by Adam Searles and others including Matt Johnson, Paul Bailey and Bronson Webb. The role of Bet was played by Danielle McCormack, Rosalind James, Francesca Jackson and Lindsey Fawcett. The role of Fagin was later played by many notable British actors and comedians including George Layton, Russ Abbot, Jim Dale and Robert Lindsay (who won an Olivier Award for his performance in 1997). Bill Sikes was later portrayed by Steven Hartley and Joe McGann, and Nancy by Sonia Swaby, Claire Moore and Ruthie Henshall. The musical closed on 21 February 1998.

==== 1998 UK tour ====
Following the Palladium production, a UK tour produced by Mackintosh (in co-production with Theatre Royal, Plymouth) began in 1998 starring Gary Wilmot as Fagin, Sonia Swaby as Nancy and David Birrell as Bill Sikes.

===2008 London revival===

A production heavily based upon the 1994 Palladium production began previews at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 12 December 2008 (with an opening night on 14 January 2009). Produced once again by Cameron Mackintosh, this revival was directed by Shakespeare expert Rupert Goold and choreographed/co-directed by Matthew Bourne. Anthony Ward repeated his acclaimed scenic and costume designs while William David Brohn joined the team as orchestrator, revising some of the musical arrangements. Designer Anthony Ward created a new cobblestone effect for the entire stage while the orchestrations were expanded with new dance arrangements given to &quot;Consider Yourself&quot; and &quot;Who Will Buy?&quot; as well as new curtain call/exit music. The prologue from the Palladium production was removed, and the show now opens as it originally did in 1960, with the workhouse children entering, singing &quot;Food, Glorious Food&quot;.

British comedian Rowan Atkinson played Fagin. He had played the role in a school production but had turned it down in the Palladium revival. Burn Gorman played Bill Sikes, making his West End musical debut. Three actors shared the role of Oliver: Harry Stott, Laurence Jeffcoate and Gwion Wyn Jones. Rob Madge, Ross McCormack, Eric Dibb Fuller and Jack Glister played The Artful Dodger. Jodie Prenger won the role of Nancy, shared with Australian Tamsin Carroll, who played two performances each week. Sarah Lark, a runner-up on &quot;I&#x27;d do Anything&quot; understudied the role. Royal Shakespeare Company actor Julian Glover played Mr. Brownlow with Julian Bleach as Mr. Sowerberry/Dr. Grimwig, Louise Gold as Mrs. Sowerberry, Julius D&#x27;Silva as Mr. Bumble and Wendy Ferguson as Widow Corney. The revival was nominated for three 2010 Olivier Awards: Best Revival of a Musical, Best Actor in a Musical (Atkinson) and Best Theatre Choreography, but failed to win any. After the departure of the original Olivers, the role was passed on to Zac Hurst, Francesco Piancentini-Smith, Edward Cooke, Edward Holtom and Ethan Smith. Edward Holtom left the role one month before his scheduled departure, when his contract expired. No reason was given for this.

When Rowan Atkinson fell ill in April 2009, Russ Abbot stepped in to play the role temporarily who previously starred in the 1997 Palladium run. In July 2009, British comedian Omid Djalili replaced Atkinson as Fagin, receiving positive reviews. In December 2009, Griff Rhys Jones took over as Fagin, with Steven Hartley as Bill Sikes. Hartley had played Sikes in the 1997 Palladium production. In March 2010, Kerry Ellis took over the role of Nancy, also receiving positive reviews. Bleach, D&#x27;Silva, and Ferguson were replaced by Jason Morell, Christian Patterson, and Claire Machin, respectively. In June 2010, Russ Abbot again took over as Fagin. Stephen Moore was a replacement for Mr. Brownlow. Ron Moody, the original Fagin, joined the cast at the end of the performance on 14 June 2010, in celebration of the show&#x27;s 50th Anniversary. Griff Rhys Jones returned as Fagin in December 2010.

The production closed on 8 January 2011, to be replaced at the theatre by the original London production of &quot;Shrek The Musical&quot;.

==== 2011-13 UK and Ireland tour ====
After the 2009 revival closed in January 2011, Cameron Mackintosh announced that a new production based on the Drury Lane production with a new set and direction by Laurence Connor would embark on a 13-month UK and Ireland tour beginning at the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff in December 2011 and ending February 2013 at the Bristol Hippodrome. The tour was announced to star Neil Morrissey and Brian Conley sharing the role of Fagin and Samantha Barks (who came third in the BBC reality show &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;, which was won by Jodie Prenger to be cast in the 2009 revival as Nancy) as Nancy before sharing the role with Cat Simmons while Barks left to appear as Éponine in the film adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (after Mackintosh announced the casting in January 2011 during the curtain call of a performance at the Palace Theatre, Manchester).

===2023 Encores!===
In June 2022, it was announced New York City Center would stage &quot;Oliver&quot; as a part of its Encores! series. The cast features Lilli Cooper (Nancy), Raúl Esparza (Fagin), Julian Lerner (The Artful Dodger), Tam Mutu (Bill Sikes), Brad Oscar (Mr. Bumble), Benjamin Pajak (Oliver), Michael Siberry (Mr. Brownlow), and Mary Testa (Widow Corney) with direction by Lear deBessonet. The production ran from May 3rd - 14th 2023. Gavin Lee was the standby for Fagin but went on several times during the run.

=== 2024 London revival ===
A new production presented by Cameron Mackintosh is set to open at the Gielgud Theatre in London&#x27;s West End beginning previews on 14 December 2024 (with an opening night on 14 January 2025) following a hit sell-out season at Chichester Festival Theatre from 8 July to 7 September 2024.

The Australian tour was a successful trip through Sydney, Melbourne, and Singapore from 2002 to 2004. The show, which mirrored Sam Mendes&#x27;s production, was recreated by Graham Gill. John Waters played Fagin, Tamsin Carroll was Nancy, and the production also featured Stuart Wagstaff, Steve Bastoni and Madison Orr and Keegan Joyce in the title role, which was rotated between the two. The role of the Artful Dodger was shared between Mathew Waters and Tim Matthews, with Waters performing on the opening night. Waters declined the tour after the Sydney production to appear in the Hollywood movie &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.

A North American tour began in 2003, produced by Cameron Mackintosh and Networks. It ran till March 2005 and played most major theatrical venues in the U.S. and one in Canada. The show was directed by the London team which managed the Sam Mendes version in London and the Australian tour, with Graham Gill as director.

<text>Sir Reginald Carey &quot;Rex&quot; Harrison (5 March 1908 – 2 June 1990) was an English actor. Harrison began his career on the stage at the Liverpool Playhouse in 1924. He made his West End debut in 1936 appearing in the Terence Rattigan play &quot;French Without Tears&quot;, in what was his breakthrough role. He won his first Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance as Henry VIII in the Broadway play &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; in 1949. He returned to Broadway portraying Professor Henry Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1956) where he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.
In addition to his stage career, Harrison also appeared in numerous films. His first starring role was opposite Vivien Leigh in the romantic comedy &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot; (1937). Receiving critical acclaim for his performance in &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1941), which was shot in London during the Blitz, his roles since then included &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1945), &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (1946), &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1947), &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), reprising his stage role as Henry Higgins which won him an Academy Award for Best Actor, and the titular character in &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967).

In 1975, Harrison released his first autobiography. In June 1989, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He was married six times and had two sons: Noel and Carey Harrison. He continued working in stage productions until shortly before his death from pancreatic cancer in June 1990 at the age of 82. His second autobiography, &quot;A Damned Serious Business: My Life in Comedy&quot;, was published posthumously in 1991.

==Early life==
Reginald Carey Harrison was born on 5 March 1908 at Derry House in Huyton, Lancashire, the son of Edith Mary (née Carey) and William Reginald Harrison, a cotton broker. From the age of 10 he went by the name “Rex”, which he adopted for himself. He was the youngest of three children and had two older sisters, Edith Marjorie Harrison (1900-1976) and Sylvia Sackville, Countess De La Warr, DBE (1903-1992). He was educated at Birkdale preparatory school and Liverpool College. After a bout of childhood measles, Harrison lost most of the sight in his left eye. He showed an early desire to become an actor, with regular appearances in school plays, and visits to the Liverpool Playhouse.

==Stage career==

Harrison first appeared on stage in 1924 in &quot;Thirty Minutes in a Street&quot; at the Liverpool Playhouse, when he was 16 years old. He remained there, playing small parts, until 1927 when he joined a touring production of &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt.&quot; Six years of touring and repertory followed. He achieved critical acclaim for &quot;Heroes Don&#x27;t Care&quot; in 1936. His West End debut in the same year was in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;French Without Tears&quot; which proved to be his breakthrough stage role as a leading light comedian. His acting career was interrupted by World War II, during which he served in the Royal Air Force (1942–1944), reaching the rank of Flight Lieutenant. 
He alternated appearances in London and New York in such plays as &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1950), &quot;Venus Observed&quot;, &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot;, &quot;The Kingfisher&quot; and &quot;The Love of Four Colonels&quot;, which he also directed. He won his first Tony Award for his appearance at the Shubert Theatre as Henry VIII in Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s play &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; and international superstardom (and a second Tony) for his portrayal of Henry Higgins in the 1956 stage musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, where he appeared opposite Julie Andrews.

Later appearances included a 1984 appearance at the Haymarket Theatre with Claudette Colbert in Frederick Lonsdale&#x27;s &quot;Aren&#x27;t We All?&quot;, and one on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre presented by Douglas Urbanski, at the Haymarket in J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; with Edward Fox. He returned as Henry Higgins in the revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; directed by Patrick Garland in 1981.

Having retired from films after &quot;A Time to Die&quot; in 1983, Harrison continued to act on Broadway and the West End until the end of his life, despite suffering from glaucoma, painful teeth, and a failing memory. Later roles included Julius Caesar in &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, and General Burgoyne in a Los Angeles production of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;. He was nominated for a third Tony Award in 1984 for his performance as Captain Shotover in the revival of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;. He followed with two successful pairings with Claudette Colbert, &quot;The Kingfisher&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Aren&#x27;t We All?&quot; in 1986. In 1989, he appeared with Edward Fox in &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; in London. In 1989/90, he appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Circle&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham, opposite Glynis Johns, Stewart Granger, and Roma Downey. The production opened at Duke University for a three-week run followed by performances in Baltimore and Boston before opening 14 November 1989 on Broadway.

==Film career==
Harrison&#x27;s film debut was in &quot;The Great Game&quot; (1930) and he had a bit part in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1930). 

He had support roles in &quot;Get Your Man&quot; (1934), &quot;Leave It to Blanche&quot; (1934), and &quot;All at Sea&quot; (1935), and a better part in &quot;Men Are Not Gods&quot; (1936) as a reporter in love with Miriam Hopkins; this was the first time Harrison worked for Alexander Korda.
===Leading man===
Harrison&#x27;s first starring role was in the romantic comedy &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot; (1937), opposite Vivien Leigh, for Korda. He starred in &quot;School for Husbands&quot; (1937) then reteamed with Leigh in &quot;St. Martin&#x27;s Lane&quot; (1938).

Harrison had a key support role in &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1938) for MGM and starred in a comedy for Korda, &quot;Over the Moon&quot; (1939) alongside Merle Oberon. He starred in some thrillers: &quot;The Silent Battle&quot; (1939), &quot;Ten Days in Paris&quot; (1940) and &quot;Night Train to Munich&quot; (1940), the latter directed by Carol Reed and co starring Margaret Lockwood.

Harrison played Adolphus in &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1941)—filmed in London during The Blitz of 1940, a role for which he received critical acclaim, and a success at the British box office. He was then absent from screens due to war service (1942–1944).

Harrison returned to films as the lead in &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1945), from the play by Noël Coward, directed by David Lean. Coward described him as &quot;The best light comedy actor in the world—except for me.&quot; 

Harrison appeared opposite Anna Neagle in &quot;I Live in Grosvenor Square&quot; (1945) which was another big hit. Also popular was &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1946), directed by Sidney Gilliat.

===20th Century Fox===
Harrison received an offer from 20th Century Fox to star in &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (1946) in Hollywood. Harrison signed a long term contract with Fox.

&quot;Anna&quot; was popular, as was &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1947) with Gene Tierney and &quot;The Foxes of Harrow&quot; (1947) with Maureen O&#x27;Hara. &quot;Escape&quot; (1949) reunited Harrison with Joseph L. Mankiewicz who had made &quot;Ghost and Mrs Muir&quot;.
===Return to England===
Back in England, he appeared in &quot;The Long Dark Hall&quot; (1951) opposite his then wife Lilli Palmer. They co-starred in an adaptation of &quot;The Four Poster&quot; (1952).

In Hollywood, he made his first action film, the medieval epic &quot;King Richard and the Crusaders&quot; (1954) playing Saladin.

In England, Harrison was in &quot;The Constant Husband&quot; (1955) for Sidney Gilliat and British Lion. It was a hit at the box office.

=== America ===
Harrison was offered top billing in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; (1958) alongside his wife Kay Kendall.

He co-starred opposite Doris Day in &quot;Midnight Lace&quot; (1960) and Rita Hayworth in &quot;The Happy Thieves&quot; (1961).
Harrison received an offer from Joseph L. Mankiewicz to play Julius Caesar in the 20th Century Fox epic &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963).

In 1964 Harrison reprised his 1956 stage performance as Henry Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, for which he won an Oscar for Best Actor.

He was one of several stars in the popular &quot;The Yellow Rolls-Royce&quot; (1964), and played the Pope opposite Charlton Heston in Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy&quot; (1965), for Carol Reed.

Harrison starred in 1967&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;. At the height of his box office fame after the success of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, Harrison proved a temperamental force during production, demanding auditions for prospective composers after musical playwright Leslie Bricusse was contracted and demanding to have his singing recorded live during shooting, only to agree to have it rerecorded in post-production. He also disrupted production by engaging in incidents with his then wife, Rachel Roberts, and through other deliberate misbehaviour, such as intentionally moving his yacht in front of cameras during shooting in St Lucia and refusing to move it out of sight, all prompted by contract disputes. Harrison was at one point temporarily replaced by Christopher Plummer, until he agreed to be more cooperative. Harrison was not by any objective standards a singer and the &quot;talking on pitch&quot; style he used in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; was adopted by many other classically trained actors with limited vocal ranges; the music was written to allow for long periods of recitative, or &quot;speaking to the music&quot;. Nevertheless &quot;Talk to the Animals&quot;, which Harrison performed in &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1967. In a rare coincidence the very next year his son Noel Harrison sang the song that won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind.&quot;

Harrison reunited with Mankiewicz in &quot;The Honey Pot&quot; (1967), a modern adaptation of Ben Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;Volpone&quot;. Two of his co-stars, Maggie Smith and Cliff Robertson, were to become lifelong friends. Both spoke at his New York City memorial at the Little Church Around the Corner when he died in 1990. 

Harrison made two more films for 20th Century Fox, both expensive play adaptations that failed at the box office: &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot; (1968), and &quot;Staircase&quot; (1969).

===Later film career===
After a break from screen acting, Harrison appeared in &quot;The Prince and The Pauper&quot; (1977) and a Hindi film, &quot;Shalimar&quot;, alongside Indian Bollywood stars Dharmendra and Zeenat Aman. He had small roles in &quot;Ashanti&quot; (1979), &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; (1979) and &quot;A Time to Die&quot; (shot 1979), his last film.

==Personal life==
Alexander Walker wrote: &quot;in looks and temperament, Rex went back to the Elizabethans. They would have called him &#x27;a man of passionate parts&#x27;. His physique and looks were far more striking once middle age had literally stretched too smooth and callow a youthful face into a long, saturnine physiognomy, whose hooded eyes and wide mouth had satyr-like associations for some people.&quot;

Harrison was married six times. In 1942, he divorced his first wife, Noel Margery Colette Thomas, and married actress Lilli Palmer the next year; they later appeared together in numerous plays and films, including &quot;The Four Poster&quot;. Whilst married to Palmer, he built a villa at Portofino, San Genesio, where over the years he hosted showbiz royalty including Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and John Gielgud and royalty, the Duke of Windsor and his wife the Duchess.

In 1947, while married to Palmer, Harrison began an affair with actress Carole Landis. Landis took her own life in 1948 after spending the evening with Harrison. Harrison&#x27;s involvement in the scandal by waiting several hours before calling a doctor and police briefly damaged his career and his contract with Fox was ended by mutual consent.

In 1955, Harrison starred opposite Kay Kendall in &quot;The Constant Husband&quot;, and they had an affair. When he learned that Kendall had been diagnosed with myeloid leukaemia, he and Palmer agreed to divorce so that he could marry Kendall and provide for her care. Harrison and Palmer divorced in 1957 and he married Kendall the same year. Kendall died of myeloid leukaemia in 1959. Terence Rattigan&#x27;s 1973 play &quot;In Praise of Love&quot; was written about the end of this marriage, and Harrison appeared in the New York production playing the character based on himself. Rattigan was said to be &quot;intensely disappointed and frustrated&quot; by Harrison&#x27;s performance, as &quot;Harrison refused to play the outwardly boorish parts of the character and instead played him as charming throughout, signalling to the audience from the start that he knew the truth about [the] illness.&quot; Critics, however, were quite pleased with the performance and although it did not have a long run it was yet another of Harrison&#x27;s well-plotted naturalistic performances.

He was subsequently married to Welsh actress Rachel Roberts from 1962 to 1971. Harrison then married Elizabeth Rees-Williams, divorcing in 1975; finally, in 1978, he married Mercia Tinker, his sixth and final wife. In 1980, despite his having married twice since their divorce, Roberts made a final attempt to win Harrison back, which proved to be futile; she took her own life that same year.

Harrison&#x27;s elder son, Noel Harrison, became an Olympic skier, singer and occasional actor; he toured in several productions including &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in his father&#x27;s award-winning role; Noel died suddenly of a heart attack on 19 October 2013 at age 79. Rex&#x27;s younger son, Carey Harrison, was a playwright and social activist. He died of a heart attack on 22 January 2025, at age 80.

Harrison&#x27;s sister Sylvia was married to the 1st Earl of Kilmuir (better known to history as Sir David Maxwell Fyfe), a lawyer, Conservative politician and judge who was successively the lead British prosecutor at Nuremberg, Home Secretary and Lord Chancellor (head of the English judiciary); after his death she married another Cabinet minister, the 9th Earl De La Warr.

Chronology of Harrison&#x27;s six marriages:
* Noel M Colette-Thomas, 1934–1942 (divorced); one son, the actor/singer Noel Harrison, (29 January 1934 – 19 October 2013)
* Lilli Palmer, 1943–1957 (divorced); one son, the novelist/playwright Carey Harrison (19 February 1944 – 22 January 2025).
* Kay Kendall, 1957–1959 (her death)
* Rachel Roberts, 1962–1971 (divorced)
* Elizabeth Rees-Williams, 1971–1975 (divorced)
* Mercia Tinker, 1978–1990 (his death)

Grandchildren:
* Granddaughters: Cathryn, Harriott, Chloe, Chiara, Rosie, Faith
* Grandsons: Will, Simon, Sam

Harrison owned properties in London, New York City and Portofino, Italy. His villa in Portofino was named San Genesio after the patron saint of actors.

==Death==
Harrison died from the effects of pancreatic cancer at his home in Manhattan, New York City, on 2 June 1990 at the age of 82. He had been diagnosed with the disease only a short time before. The stage production in which he was appearing at the time, &quot;The Circle&quot;, came to an end upon his death.

His body was cremated, some of his ashes being subsequently scattered in Portofino, and the rest being scattered at his second wife Lilli Palmer&#x27;s grave at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, in the Commemoration section, Map 1, Lot 4066, Space 2.

Harrison&#x27;s second autobiography, &quot;A Damned Serious Business: My Life in Comedy&quot;, was published posthumously in 1991.

==Honours and legacy==
* On 17 June 1989, Harrison was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.

* Rex Harrison has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one at 6906 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to films, and the other at 6380 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to television. Harrison is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame. He was inducted in 1979.

== Recognition ==
Seth MacFarlane, creator of the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, modelled the voice of the character Stewie Griffin after Harrison, after seeing him in the film adaptation of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;.

Ex-CIA chief of disguise Jonna Mendez stated in 2019 that a mask of Harrison was used by multiple CIA agents for covert work. The moulds of his face were larger and so could fit over a smaller agents face. The moulds were made from aluminium and bought from Hollywood film facilities. She mentioned that his likeness was &quot;taking part in a lot of operations&quot;. According to Mendez, Rex Harrison&#x27;s aluminium facial props mould was used as a baseline for over-the-head masks that the agency would create and use operationally. The masks came in small, medium and large sizes, with Rex&#x27;s mould becoming the agency&#x27;s standard &quot;large&quot; size. Subsequently, many undercover operatives&#x27; real identities were disguised by masks bearing Rex&#x27;s facial features.

<text>Funny Girl is a musical with score by Jule Styne, lyrics by Bob Merrill, and book by Isobel Lennart, that first opened on Broadway in 1964. The semi-biographical plot is based on the life and career of comedian and Broadway star Fanny Brice, featuring her stormy relationship with entrepreneur and gambler Nicky Arnstein.

Barbra Streisand starred in the original Broadway musical, produced by Brice&#x27;s son-in-law Ray Stark. The production received eight nominations at the 18th Tony Awards. The original cast recording of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2004.

A Broadway revival opened April 24, 2022, starring Beanie Feldstein as Brice and Ramin Karimloo as Arnstein. Lea Michele stepped into the lead role that September, with rave reviews prompting a new Broadway cast recording two months later.

==Background==
Stark married Fanny Brice&#x27;s and Nicky Arnstein&#x27;s daughter Frances Brice in 1940. In telling Fanny&#x27;s story, Stark produced the Broadway musical, film version and film sequel &quot;Funny Lady&quot;.

Ray Stark commissioned an authorized biography of Brice, based on taped recollections that she had dictated, but the result of which she was unhappy with. Stopping the publication of &quot;The Fabulous Fanny&quot;, as it had been titled by the author, eventually cost him $50,000. Stark then turned to Ben Hecht to write the screenplay for a biopic, but neither Hecht nor the 10 writers who succeeded him were able to produce a version that satisfied Stark. Finally, Isobel Lennart submitted &quot;My Man&quot;, which pleased both Stark and Columbia Pictures executives, who offered Stark $400,000 plus a percentage of the gross for the property.

After reading the screenplay, Mary Martin contacted Stark and proposed it be adapted for a stage musical. Stark discussed the possibility with producer David Merrick, who suggested Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim compose the score. Sondheim told Styne &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do the life of Fanny Brice with Mary Martin. She&#x27;s not Jewish. You need someone ethnic for the part.&quot; Shortly after, Martin lost interest in the project and withdrew.

Merrick discussed the project with Jerome Robbins, who gave the screenplay to Anne Bancroft. She agreed to play Brice if she could handle the score. Merrick suggested Styne collaborate with Dorothy Fields, but the composer was not interested. He went to Palm Beach, Florida for a month and composed music he thought Bancroft would be able to sing. While he was there, he met Bob Merrill, and he played the five melodies he already had written for him. Merrill agreed to write lyrics for them; these included &quot;Who Are You Now?&quot; and &quot;The Music That Makes Me Dance&quot;. Styne was happy with the results and the two men completed the rest of the score, then flew to Los Angeles to play it for Stark, Robbins, and Bancroft. Bancroft was at odds with Merrill because of an earlier personal conflict, and after listening to the score, she stated &quot;I want no part of this. It&#x27;s not for me&quot;.

With Bancroft out of the picture, Eydie Gormé was considered, but she agreed to play Brice only if her husband Steve Lawrence was cast as Nick Arnstein. Because they thought he was wrong for the role, Stark and Robbins approached Carol Burnett, who said &quot;I&#x27;d love to do it but what you need is a Jewish girl.&quot; With options running out, Styne recalled Barbra Streisand, whom he remembered from &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot;, and thought that she would be perfect. She was performing at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village at the time; Styne urged Robbins to go see her there. He was impressed and asked her to audition. Styne later recalled, &quot;She looked awful ... All her clothes were out of thrift shops. I saw Fran Stark staring at her, obvious distaste on her face.&quot; Despite his wife&#x27;s objections, Stark hired Streisand on the spot.

Robbins had an argument with Lennart and told Stark he wanted her replaced because he thought she was not capable of adapting her screenplay into a viable book for a stage musical. Stark refused and Robbins quit the project.

&quot;Funny Girl&quot; temporarily was shelved, and Styne moved on to other projects, including &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot; for Carol Burnett. Merrick signed Bob Fosse to direct &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, and work began on it again, until Fosse quit and the show went into limbo for several months, at which point Merrick suggested that Stark hire Garson Kanin. It was Merrick&#x27;s last contribution to the production; shortly afterward he bowed out, and Stark became sole producer.

Streisand was not enthusiastic about Kanin as a director and insisted she wanted Robbins back, especially after Kanin suggested &quot;People&quot; be cut from the score because it didn&#x27;t fit the character. Streisand already had recorded the song for a single release, and Merrill insisted, &quot;It has to be in the show because it&#x27;s the greatest thing she&#x27;s ever done.&quot; Based on audience reaction to it, Kanin agreed to let it remain. By the time the show opened in Boston, audiences were so familiar with &quot;People&quot; that they applauded it during the overture.

There were problems with the script and score throughout rehearsals, and when &quot;Funny Girl&quot; opened at the Shubert Theatre in Boston it was too long, even after thirty minutes had been cut. The critics praised Streisand but disliked the show. Lennart continued to edit her book and deleted another thirty minutes before the show moved to Philadelphia, where critics thought the show could be a hit if the libretto problems were rectified.

The New York opening was postponed five times while extra weeks were played out of town. &quot;Funny Girl&quot; played two tryout periods in Philadelphia at the Forrest and Erlanger theaters. Five songs were cut, and &quot;You Are Woman&quot;, a solo for Sydney Chaplin, was rewritten as a counterpoint duet. Streisand was still unhappy with Kanin and was pleased when Robbins returned to oversee the choreography by Carol Haney.

Kanin&#x27;s novel &quot;Smash&quot; is based loosely on his experience directing &quot;Funny Girl&quot;.

==Productions==

=== Broadway ===
After 17 previews, the Broadway production opened March 26, 1964 at the Winter Garden Theatre, subsequently transferring to the Majestic Theatre and The Broadway Theatre, where it closed on July 1, 1967 to complete its total run of 1,348 performances. The musical was directed by Garson Kanin and choreographed by Carol Haney under the supervision of Jerome Robbins. In addition to Streisand and Chaplin, the original cast included Kay Medford, Danny Meehan, Jean Stapleton, and Lainie Kazan, who also served as Streisand&#x27;s understudy. Later in the run, Streisand and Chaplin were replaced by Mimi Hines and Johnny Desmond, and Hines&#x27; husband and comedy partner Phil Ford also joined the cast.

=== West End ===
Streisand reprised her role in the West End production at the Prince of Wales Theatre directed by Lawrence Kasha, which opened April 13, 1966. When Streisand became pregnant and had to drop out of the show, her understudy Lisa Shane, wife of &quot;The Italian Job&quot; director Peter Collinson, took over, and continued to perform until the show closed.

=== Australia ===
The Australasian premiere season commenced March 4, 1966, at the Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney. The production starred Jill Perryman as Fanny Brice, Bruce Barry as Nick Arnstein, Evie Hayes as Mrs. Brice, and Bill Yule as Eddie Ryan.

In 1999, The Production Company produced &quot;Funny Girl&quot; at the Arts Centre Melbourne, starring Caroline O&#x27;Connor and Nancye Hayes. The production was revived in 2016, with O&#x27;Connor and Hayes reprising their roles.

A concert version was staged at the Sydney Opera House from July 12–14, 2018. The role of Fanny Brice on stage was shared by Michala Banas, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Casey Donovan, Virginia Gay, Verity Hunt-Ballard, Dami Im, Maggie McKenna, Zahra Newman, Caroline O’Connor, Queenie van de Zandt and Megan Washington. The show also starred Trevor Ashley, Nancye Hayes and Don Hany as Nick Arnstein.

=== North American tours ===
The First National Tour gave top billing to Lillian Roth as Mrs. Brice, Anthony George as Nick, with Marilyn Michaels as Fanny billed third.

A 1996 United States National tour starred Debbie Gibson as Fanny Brice and Robert Westenberg as Nick Arnstein. The planned 30-city tour started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in October 1996, but ended prematurely in November 1996 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

A 2023 United States national tour of the 2022 Broadway revival opened in Providence, Rhode Island on September 9, 2023, starring Katerina McCrimmon, Stephen Mark Lukas, and Melissa Manchester.

=== West End revival ===
The show&#x27;s first ever full-scale revival began previews at the Menier Chocolate Factory on November 20, 2015, officially opening December 2 for a limited run to March 5, 2016. The production starred Sheridan Smith, with Darius Campbell as Nick, directed by Michael Mayer, with a revised book by Harvey Fierstein. The entire run sold out within a day, making it the Menier&#x27;s fastest selling show on record. Following this, the show transferred to London&#x27;s Savoy Theatre on April 9, 2016, for a run through to September 10, 2016. The show subsequently extended until October 8 due to phenomenal public demand. However, Smith became indisposed on April 28, 2016, and the show was halted 15 minutes in. She was replaced by her understudy Natasha J Barnes, who continued to play the role until Smith&#x27;s eventual return on July 8.

A UK tour of the Menier production began in February 2017 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester. After very favourable reviews, both Smith and Barnes returned to the role of Fanny Brice and alternative venues throughout the UK tour.

=== Paris ===
A Paris production opened in November 2019 at Théâtre Marigny, directed and choreographed by Stephen Mear and featuring Christina Bianco as Fanny. The show received unanimous rave reviews, with significant praise for Bianco. The production was extended, doubling its initial run dates.

=== Broadway revival ===
A revival production began Broadway previews on March 26, 2022, at the August Wilson Theatre with an official opening on April 24, 2022, starring Beanie Feldstein as Fanny Brice, directed by Michael Mayer, music directed by Michael Rafter, with a revised book by Harvey Fierstein. The production also starred Ramin Karimloo as Nick Arnstein, Jared Grimes as Eddie Ryan, and Jane Lynch as Mrs. Brice. The production received mostly negative reviews from critics, though Grimes received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. On July 10, 2022, Feldstein announced that she would depart the production at the end of the month, instead of September as previously planned; the following day, the production confirmed that Lea Michele and Tovah Feldshuh would replace Feldstein and Lynch respectively from September 6, with Julie Benko as Fanny in the interim. On August 9, 2022, Lynch announced that she would depart the production on August 14 instead of the previously planned date in September and that standby Liz McCartney would play the role of Mrs. Brice until Feldshuh began her run. On March 28, 2023, Paolo Montalban and Anne L. Nathan replaced Peter Francis James and Toni DiBuono as Florenz Ziegfeld and Mrs. Strakosh, respectively. From June 27 to July 16, Stephen Mark Lukas played Nick Arnstein when Karimloo went to Italy to star in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

Producers announced in March 2023 that the show would close September 3 after 599 performances. The production successfully recouped its $16.5M capitalization.

Lea Michele assuming the role of Fanny Brice parallels her &quot;Glee&quot; character storyline, where Rachel Berry lands her dream role in Broadway&#x27;s (fictional) first revival of &quot;Funny Girl&quot;. Michele&#x27;s performance turned declining box office numbers around and received critical acclaim in the role with universally positive reviews, including many citing superior vocals compared to her predecessor.

=== Other productions ===
On September 23, 2002, a concert version for the benefit of the Actors&#x27; Fund was staged in New York City at the New Amsterdam Theatre. Performers included Carolee Carmello, Kristin Chenoweth, Sutton Foster, Ana Gasteyer, Whoopi Goldberg, Jane Krakowski, Judy Kuhn, Julia Murney, LaChanze, Ricki Lake, Andrea Martin, Idina Menzel, Bebe Neuwirth, Kaye Ballard, Alice Playten, Lillias White, Len Cariou, Jason Danieley, Peter Gallagher, Gary Beach, Brad Oscar, Richard Kind, and The Rockettes.

In regional theatre the Paper Mill Playhouse, Millburn, New Jersey, production ran in April to May 2001 with Leslie Kritzer and Robert Cuccioli. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer noted: &quot;What makes it all the more impressive is that few actors, or theater companies outside of summer stock, dare to attempt Jule Styne&#x27;s and Bob Merrill&#x27;s grand spectacle that propelled Barbra Streisand&#x27;s career nearly 40 years ago.&quot; The Westchester Broadway Theatre production ran from March to June 2009, with Jill Abramovitz as Fanny. The production at Drury Lane Oakbrook ran from December 2009 to March 7, 2010. Gary Griffin was the co-director with Drury Lane artistic director William Osetek, with the cast that featured Sara Sheperd.

A revival directed by Bartlett Sher had been announced to premiere at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in January 2012 with Lauren Ambrose starring as Fanny Brice and Bobby Cannavale as Nick Arnstein, and then open on Broadway in April 2012. However, on November 3, 2011, producer Bob Boyett announced that this production has been postponed. He said &quot;We have made the extremely difficult decision today to postpone our production of &quot;Funny Girl&quot;. Given the current economic climate, many Broadway producing investors have found it impossible to maintain their standard level of financial commitment.&quot;

The first lavish Israeli production of the musical premiered in 2016, 52 years after the original Broadway premiere. There was a controversy about the casting for the role of Fanny Brice. The role was promised for actress Tali Oren, who was a freelanced actress, but then the role was offered to Mia Dagan who was signed with Beit Lessin Theatre. Dagan, who jumped on the opportunity in the first minute, took the role and signed off the contract with Beit Lessin. The production also included Amos Tamam as Nick Arnstein.

==Synopsis==
The musical is set in and around New York City just before and following World War I. &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; star Fanny Brice, awaiting the return of her husband Nicky Arnstein from prison, reflects on their life together, and their story is told as a flashback.

===Original Broadway Version===
Act 1

Fanny is a stage-struck teen who gets her first job in vaudeville. Her mother and her mother’s friend Mrs. Strakosh try to dissuade her from show business because Fanny is not the typical beauty (&quot;If a Girl Isn&#x27;t Pretty&quot;). But Fanny perseveres (&quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest Star&quot;) and is helped and encouraged by Eddie Ryan, a dancer she meets in the vaudeville shows. Once Fanny&#x27;s career takes off, Eddie and Mrs. Brice lament that once she&#x27;s on Broadway she&#x27;ll forget about them (&quot;Who Taught Her Everything?&quot;). Fanny performs a supposedly romantic number in the Follies, but she turns it into a classic comic routine, ending the number as a pregnant bride (&quot;His Love Makes Me Beautiful&quot;), causing an uproar.

She meets the sophisticated and handsome Nick Arnstein, who accompanies Fanny to her mother&#x27;s opening night party on &quot;Henry Street&quot;. Fanny is clearly falling in love with Nick, while acknowledging their complex vulnerabilities (&quot;People&quot;). Later they meet in Baltimore and have a private dinner at a swanky restaurant and declare their feelings (&quot;You Are Woman, I Am Man&quot;). Fanny is determined to marry Nick, regardless of his gambling past (&quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade&quot;).

Act 2

The two marry, move to a mansion on Long Island, and have a daughter, Frances (&quot;Sadie, Sadie&quot;). In the meantime, Mrs. Strakosh and Eddie suggest to Mrs. Brice that she should find a man to marry, now that her daughter is supporting her (&quot;Find Yourself a Man&quot;). Fanny has become a major star with the Ziegfeld Follies (&quot;Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat&quot;). Nick asks Ziegfeld to invest in a gambling casino, but although Ziegfeld passes, Fanny insists on investing. When the venture fails and they lose their money, Fanny tries to make light of it, which propels Nick to get involved in a shady bond deal, resulting in his arrest for embezzlement. Fanny feels helpless but stronger than ever in her love for him (&quot;The Music That Makes Me Dance&quot;).

In the present, Fanny is waiting for Nick to arrive and has time to reflect on her situation. Nick arrives, newly released from prison, and he and Fanny decide to separate. She is heartbroken, but resolves to pick up her life again (&quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade (Reprise)&quot;).

=== 2022 Broadway Revival ===
Act 1

In the present, Fanny Brice sits in her dressing room whilst preparing to star in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, awaiting news to hear if her husband, Nicky Arnstein, has been freed from prison and reminiscing on her earlier life (&quot;Who Are You Now?&quot;) In the past, Fanny is a stage-struck teen, though her mother and her mother’s friends Mrs. Strakosh and Mrs. Meeker try to dissuade her from show business because Fanny is not the typical beauty (&quot;If a Girl Isn&#x27;t Pretty&quot;). This is proved true when at her first vaudeville job as a chorus dancer, she is fired by the theater&#x27;s owner, Tom Keeney. She confides to her friend Eddie Ryan, who got her the job, that she knows she will succeed (&quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest Star&quot;). Later, rehearsing with Eddie to re-audition for Keeney, Mrs. Brice echos Fanny&#x27;s point (&quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest Star (Reprise)&quot;) and Fanny revolves to audition again for Keeney. After &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Tap,&quot; Fanny nervously performs her first number &quot;Cornet Man,&quot; though eventually, she wins over the audience and the attention of handsome gambler, Nicky Arnstein, who is able to wager Keeney a higher pay for Fanny and gives her his card.

A year later, Fanny receives a telegram from Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. asking her to meet him at his theater, which Fanny proposes is connected to her interaction with Nick. At the theater, Fanny argues with Ziegfeld over his song choice for her but is forced to perform the song. However, she turns the supposedly romantic number, &quot;His Love Makes Me Beautiful,&quot; into a comedy in which she portrays a pregnant bride. Backstage, Fanny&#x27;s family and friends are thrilled but Ziegfeld reprimands her to which she apologizes, though he admits he found the act funny. Nick appears backstage, congratulating Fanny on her performance, and escorts her home (&quot;I Wanna Be Seen With You Tonight&quot;) where her mother and close friends have thrown her a party, celebrating her success (&quot;Henry Street&quot;). Later in the evening, Fanny opens up to Nick about her desire to find love (&quot;People&quot;), and Nick admits that he would initiate a relationship between them, but acknowledges that he is leaving New York the next day.

Sometime later, Fanny is touring with the follies and she and Nick both find themselves in Baltimore. Nick brings her to dinner at a fancy establishment, where she panics in response to his somewhat rapid advances, though she eventually gives in (&quot;You Are Woman, I Am Man&quot;). Later, the follies company is preparing to leave Cleveland and Fanny and Nick appear arm in arm. However, he tells her he will not be following the company, as he has to win back his money in Monte Carlo. He tells her he loves her but when she asks him to marry her, he insists that they cannot wed until he is rich again. In a last minute decision, she decides that she needs to follow him in pursuit of marriage, no matter what it means for her career (&quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on my Parade&quot;).

Act 2

Fanny surprises Nick in Monte Carlo (&quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot;/&quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on my Parade (Reprise)&quot;). He tells her that he has won back his wealth and the two are married and move to a mansion on Long Island, with Fanny soon revealing that she is pregnant (&quot;Sadie, Sadie&quot;). Back on Henry Street (&quot;Sadie, Sadie (Playoff)&quot;), Mrs. Brice and Eddie lament that Fanny no longer needs them (&quot;Who Taught Her Everything She Knows?&quot;). A few months later, as Fanny prepares to go back to rehearsals for a new show, Nick abruptly tells her that he is heading to Philadelphia to find investors for a casino he&#x27;s building in Miami. Fanny reacts badly, nervous about leaving their daughter, Frances, for a whole day, though Nick promises that he will only be gone for a day, but in the end, she convinces him to stay and she is welcomed back to the theater (&quot;You Are Woman (Reprise)&quot;/&quot;Henry Street (Reprise)&quot;). Nick follows her to the theater and attempts to convince Ziegfeld to invest in his project, but Ziegfeld dismisses him. In response, Fanny decides to invest $68,000 of her money into Nick&#x27;s project. Over the next few days, Nick travels to Florida and enters in a series of business deals with Fanny&#x27;s money (&quot;Temporary Arrangement&quot;).

On Fanny&#x27;s opening night for her new show, she anxiously waits Nick&#x27;s arrival, who is still traveling, telling Eddie that this would be the first opening night of hers he has missed. After her performance (&quot;Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat&quot;), Fanny&#x27;s mother comforts her before Nick appears in her dressing room, revealing that a hurricane in Florida has destroyed the casino and lost them their money. She assures him that they will rebuild their success and that the most important thing to her is him (&quot;Who Are You Now? (Reprise)&quot;/&quot;People (Reprise)&quot;). The following year, Nick is involved in a business proposal to become a partner at a talent agency without putting up any money, though he sees through the act and realizes that Fanny has put up the money on their behalf. Nick reacts badly, insisting that he does not need her help to succeed and calls about a mob deal he was informed about, agreeing to join the deal in exchange for $68,000 (&quot;You&#x27;re a Funny Girl/Beekman Call&quot;). Back at the follies, Fanny prepares a new routine (&quot;What Do Happy People Do?&quot;), but her mother arrives to inform her that Nick has been arrested for embezzlement. When Fanny insists that Nick couldn&#x27;t have known the deal was faulty, her mother calls her out for making him feel unimportant in her life. Alone, Fanny reflects on how important he is to her (&quot;The Music That Makes Me Dance&quot;).

Flashing back to the present, (&quot;Dream Ballet&quot;), three years after the arrest, Fanny and Eddie share one last tender moment as Nick appears in the doorway. She insists that she&#x27;s willing to change to make their relationship better but he abruptly asks her for a divorce. She is taken aback but thanks him for making her feel &quot;almost, sorta...beautiful.&quot; He assures her that she is beautiful, then leaves. Fanny somberly reflects on their marriage (&quot;Funny Girl&quot;) but as she is called to the stage, she resolves to start again, stating &quot;That&#x27;s life in the theatre!&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on my Parade (Reprise II)&quot;).

<text>Rachel, Rachel is a 1968 American drama film produced and directed by Paul Newman and starring his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the title role and co-starring Estelle Parsons and James Olson. The screenplay, by Stewart Stern based on the 1966 novel &quot;A Jest of God&quot; by Canadian author Margaret Laurence, concerns a schoolteacher in small-town Connecticut and her sexual awakening and independence in her mid-30s. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress for Woodward, and Best Supporting Actress for Parsons) and won two Golden Globes: Best Director and Best Actress (Drama).

==Plot==
Rachel Cameron is a shy, 35-year-old, unmarried schoolteacher living with her widowed mother in an apartment above the funeral home once owned by her father in a small town in Connecticut. School is out for summer vacation, and Rachel anticipates a typically boring summer at home with her mother. Fellow unmarried teacher and best friend Calla Mackie persuades Rachel to attend a revival meeting, where a visiting preacher encourages Rachel to express her need for the love of Jesus. Rachel is overwhelmed by the experience, expressing so much suppressed emotion that she is embarrassed. Calla tries to comfort Rachel and suddenly kisses her passionately. Rachel is shocked and runs home and then begins to avoid Calla.

Nick Kazlik, Rachel&#x27;s high-school classmate who now teaches at an inner city school in the Bronx, arrives for a short visit. Nick&#x27;s first appearance in the film happens in a flashback to Rachel&#x27;s childhood, when he and Rachel talked right after his dead twin brother was carried into Rachel&#x27;s father&#x27;s funeral home in a basket.

Upon first seeing the adult Rachel many years later, Nick makes a crude pass that Rachel rebuffs, but after the episode with Calla, she succumbs to his charms and has her first sexual experience. Mistaking lust for love, she begins to plan a future with Nick, who tries to rebuff her gently by showing her a photo of a young boy who looks exactly like him that Rachel thinks is his son. Through a telephone call to Nick&#x27;s mother, Rachel later discovers that he never married. The child in the photograph who looked exactly like Nick must have been Nick&#x27;s twin brother, and he must have carried the loss with him into adulthood, perhaps keeping him from having close relationships.

Believing that she is pregnant, Rachel plans to leave town and raise the child. With Calla&#x27;s assistance, she finds a teaching job in Oregon, but before the summer ends, she learns, to her great disappointment, that she is not pregnant and that her symptoms are the result of a benign cyst. After undergoing surgery to have the cyst removed, Rachel tells her mother that she is moving to Oregon (where her sister lives with her husband and children), and that her mother may accompany her if she wishes. Her mother reluctantly agrees to accompany her. Rachel sets out with hope for the future, having learned that she has choices, that she is able to give and receive sexual pleasure, and that it is possible for her to actively embrace life rather than waiting for it to find her. On the bus ride she fantasizes about walking along the beach holding the hand of a young child.

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Renata Adler called &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; &quot;the best written, most seriously acted American movie in a long time&quot; and wrote &quot;The direction is mainly sensitive and discreet, but now and then the whole thing goes awash in excess of sentimentality or even ambition. You cannot convey the quality of life in this sort of town, through Rachel&#x27;s perspective, without losing proportion in melodrama and glop. Petty tragedies, faithfully portrayed, are a little embarrassing...If this were a less ironic age, it might work seriously and completely—like a kind of American cinema Balzac.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; wrote: &quot;Stewart Stern often gets too close to the novel, adopting where he should adapt. Rachel is shackled with prosy monologues that should have been given visual form. Despite its failings, &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; has several unassailable assets...It is in the transcendent strength of Joanne Woodward that the film achieves a classic stature. There is no gesture too minor for her to master. She peers out at the world with the washed-out eyes of a hunted animal. Her walk is a ladylike retreat, a sign of a losing battle with time and diets and fashion. Her drab voice quavers with a brittle strength that can command a student but break before a parent&#x27;s will. By any reckoning, it is [her] best performance.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; an &quot;offbeat film&quot; that &quot;moves too slowly&quot; and added &quot;There is very little dialog—most of which is very good—but this asset makes a liability out of the predominantly visual nature of the development, which in time seems to become redundant, padded and tiring...Direction is awkward. Were Woodward not there the film could have been a shambles.&quot;

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 92% of 12 critics gave a positive review of the film, with an average rating of 7.1 out of 10. On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 74 out of 100 based on nine reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<doc id="99024" wikidata="Q753118" url="?curid=99024" title="Du hast">
<text>&quot;Du hast&quot; () is a song by German metal band Rammstein. It was released as the second single from their second album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; (1997). It has appeared on numerous soundtracks for films, most notably &quot;The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture&quot;, &quot;How High&quot;, and the home video &quot;CKY2K&quot;. It is featured in the music video games &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot; and &quot;Rock Band 3&quot;. The song&#x27;s title is a play on the homophones &quot;du hasst&quot; (&quot;you hate&quot;) and &quot;du hast&quot; (&quot;you have&quot;).

==Overview==
There are two versions of the song: the original version completely in German, and a second version partially in English (found on special editions of the &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; album). In the second version, the first chorus and the verses are in English and the last chorus is in German. The English lyrics are not a direct translation of the German; the original lyrics take advantage of a pair of German homophones: when conjugated in the second person singular form (i.e. &quot;you&quot;), the verbs &quot;haben&quot; (to have) and &quot;hassen&quot; (to hate) become respectively &quot;du hast&quot; and &quot;du hasst&quot;, which sound identical. The guitar riff is similar to Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Just One Fix&quot;. The music was written by keyboardist Flake and guitarist Richard Kruspe. The intro section and the verses were a combination of a synth sequence by Flake and a guitar riff by Kruspe, and the chorus was written around a chord sequence by Flake.

==Live performances==
The first known performance of the song dates from 9 April 1997 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Over the years, several stunts have been used during the live performances of &quot;Du hast&quot;, ranging from the dildo used in &quot;Bück dich&quot;, to the bow used in &quot;Du riechst so gut&quot;. In their &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; and &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot; tours, flames shoot several feet into the air and Till Lindemann fired with a different bow into the air, &quot;starting&quot; a chain reaction that fired rockets over the audience. Being a fan favourite, it has been played at almost every concert to date since its initial performance. When performed live, the intro is always a bit longer than the studio version.

The song has been covered by Motionless in White for &quot;Punk Goes 90s Vol. 2&quot; in 2014 and was referenced by Lizzo while performing in Germany in 2023.

==Music video==
The music video for the song was directed by Philipp Stölzl, and was summed up by one review as &quot;crime, masks, love, violence, betrayal, fire and booze&quot;. It begins with Rammstein drummer Christoph Schneider pulling up outside an isolated building in a car with a woman played by German actress Astrid Meyerfeldt, whom Schneider kisses and embraces. The video then cuts to masked men aggressively singing towards the camera, before cutting back and forth between this and Schneider taking a handgun out of a bag in the car and tucking it into his belt as he enters the building. Inside, he sees the masked men lined up behind a chair. They remove their masks to reveal that they are the other members of the band, and a relieved Schneider releases his grip from the gun and embraces them, drinking and celebrating with them. All the while, the woman waits nervously outside, first in the car, and then pacing outside of it, then sitting on the ground beside it smoking a cigarette, as dusk falls. More imagery from inside the building appears to show Till smacking someone from camera view, then the band members menacing someone on the floor emphasizing the song chorus, then administering an unknown substance with a syringe, then a figure walking engulfed in flames. The video ends with Schneider and the rest of the band walking out of the building in an abreast row and past the car, with Schneider glancing at the woman leaning against it and checking his watch before the car detonates, but the woman&#x27;s fate is unconfirmed.

<text>Romeo and Juliet () is a 1968 period romantic tragedy film, based on the play of the same name by William Shakespeare. Directed and co-written by Franco Zeffirelli, the film stars Leonard Whiting as Romeo and Olivia Hussey as Juliet. Laurence Olivier spoke the film&#x27;s prologue and epilogue and dubs the voice of Antonio Pierfederici, who played Lord Montague but was not credited on-screen. The cast also features Milo O&#x27;Shea, Michael York, John McEnery, Bruce Robinson, and Robert Stephens.

The film adaptation of a Shakespeare play was a financial success during its time of release. It became popular among teenagers because it was the first adaptation to cast actors close to the age of the characters from the original play. Many critics also praised the film. It won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design. Additionally, it was nominated for Best Director and Best Picture, making it the last Shakespearean film to be nominated for the latter category. Whiting and Hussey both won Golden Globe Awards for Most Promising Newcomers.

==Plot==
One summer morning in Verona, a longstanding feud between the Montague and the Capulet clans breaks out in a street brawl. The brawl is broken up by the Prince, who warns both families that any future violence between them will result in harsh consequences. That night, two teenagers of the two families—Romeo and Juliet—meet at a Capulet masked ball and fall in love. Later, Romeo stumbles into the secluded garden under Juliet&#x27;s bedroom balcony and the two exchange impassioned pledges. They are secretly married the next day by Romeo&#x27;s confessor and father figure, Friar Laurence, with the assistance of Juliet&#x27;s nurse.

That afternoon, Juliet&#x27;s cousin Tybalt, furious that Romeo had attended his family&#x27;s ball, insults him and challenges him to a brawl. Romeo now regards Tybalt as family and he refuses to fight him, which leads Romeo&#x27;s best friend, Mercutio, to fight Tybalt instead. Despite Romeo&#x27;s efforts to stop the fight, Tybalt mortally wounds Mercutio, who curses both the Montague and Capulet houses before dying. Enraged over his friend&#x27;s death, Romeo retaliates by fighting Tybalt and killing him. Romeo is subsequently punished by the Prince with banishment from Verona, with the threat of death if he ever returns. Romeo then secretly spends his wedding night with Juliet, the couple consummate their marriage, and Romeo flees.

Juliet&#x27;s parents, unaware of their daughter&#x27;s secret marriage, have arranged for Juliet to marry wealthy Count Paris. Juliet pleads with her parents to postpone the marriage, but they refuse and threaten to disown her. Juliet seeks out Friar Laurence for help, hoping to escape her arranged marriage to Paris and remain faithful to Romeo. At Friar Laurence&#x27;s behest, she reconciles with her parents and agrees to their wishes. On the night before the wedding, Juliet consumes a potion prepared by Friar Laurence intended to make her appear dead for 42 hours. Friar Laurence plans to inform Romeo of the hoax so that Romeo can meet Juliet after her burial and escape with her when she recovers from her swoon, so he sends Friar John to give Romeo a letter describing the plan.

However, when Balthasar, Romeo&#x27;s servant, sees Juliet being buried under the impression that she is dead, he goes to tell Romeo and reaches him before Friar John. In despair, Romeo goes to Juliet&#x27;s tomb and kills himself by drinking poison. Soon afterwards, Friar Laurence arrives as Juliet awakens. Despite his attempts to persuade her to flee from the crypt, Juliet refuses to leave Romeo, and once the Friar flees, she kills herself by plunging his dagger into her chest. Later, the two families, having ended their feud, attend their joint funeral and are condemned by the Prince.

==Production==
===Casting===
Paul McCartney has said he was considered by Franco Zeffirelli for the role of Romeo. Although Zeffirelli does not mention it in his autobiography, McCartney provided details on this account (including meeting with Olivia Hussey and exchanging telegrams with her) in his co-written autobiography.

Zeffirelli engaged in a worldwide search for unknown teenage actors to play the parts of the two lovers. Musician Phil Collins was in the running for Romeo, while his then-girlfriend Lavinia Lang (herself a great friend to Hussey) was in the running for Juliet, as was actress Anjelica Huston, but the latter&#x27;s father, director John Huston, withdrew her from consideration when he decided to cast her in his film &quot;A Walk with Love and Death&quot;. When they were cast, Whiting and Hussey were 16 and 15 years old respectively. However, both stars had aged a year by the time filming began in the summer of 1967. Zeffirelli adapted the play in such a way as to play to their strengths and hide their weaknesses: for instance, long speeches were trimmed, and he emphasized reaction shots. Zeffirelli said of the casting: &quot;It&#x27;s a tremendous risk. We just hope to have the right chemistry – a melancholy Romeo who rebels like all the youth of today and a pure, determined Juliet. If we fail, it will be ridiculous.&quot;

Laurence Olivier&#x27;s involvement in the production was by happenstance. He was in Rome to film &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; and visited the studio where &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was being shot. He asked Zeffirelli if there was anything he could do, and was given the Prologue to read, then ended up dubbing the voice of Lord Montague as well as other assorted minor roles.

===Filming===
After cast readings in late May, rehearsals and filming began at the end of June 1967 in Tuscania, Italy, then moved to Pienza, Gubbio, and Artena, before completing at Cinecittà movie studios in Rome. The famous Romeo and Juliet balcony scene was filmed in Artena in September 1967.

The film is set in 14th century Renaissance Italy.
* The balcony scene: at the Palazzo Borghese, built by Cardinal Scipione Borghese in the 16th century, in Artena, 40 km southeast of Rome.
* The interior church scenes: at the Romanesque church of San Pietro, Tuscania in the town of Tuscania, 90 km northwest of Rome.
* The tomb scene: also in Tuscania.
* The palace of the Capulets&#x27; scenes: at Palazzo Piccolomini, built from 1459 to 1462 by Pope Pius II, in the city of Pienza in the Siena province.
* The duelling scenes with swords were filmed in the old Umbrian town of Gubbio.
* The film also has some scenes filmed in Montagnana.
* The street scenes: also in Pienza and on the Cinecittà Studios backlot, Rome.

===Editing===
During post-production, several scenes were trimmed or cut. Act 5, Scene 3, in which Romeo fights and eventually kills Paris outside Juliet&#x27;s crypt, was filmed but deleted from the final print. According to Leonard Whiting and Roberto Bisacco, Zeffirelli cut the scene because he felt it unnecessarily made Romeo less sympathetic.

The final budgeted cost for the film was .

== Release and reception ==

On March 4, 1968, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; premiered during the Royal Film Performance, and was widely released in the United Kingdom the next day. It was released on 8 October 1968 in the United States and on 19 October in Italy. The film earned $14.5 million in North American box-office rentals during 1969 (equivalent to $ million in ). It was re-released in 1973 and earned US$1.7 million in rentals (equivalent to $ million in ).

The Motion Picture Association of America initially gave the film a G rating in the United States when it was first released, although they re-rated it to a PG rating in its 1973 re-release.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a &quot;Fresh&quot; score of 95% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10, accompanied by a positive consensus: &quot;The solid leads and arresting visuals make a case for Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; as the definitive cinematic adaptation of the play.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;I believe Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is the most exciting film of Shakespeare ever made.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
===Lawsuit===
Despite her previous defense of the film&#x27;s nudity, asserting that it was done &quot;tastefully&quot; and was &quot;needed for the film&quot;, Hussey, along with Whiting, filed a lawsuit on 3 January 2023 in the Los Angeles County Superior Court against Paramount Pictures for US$500 million, alleging sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud, and for allowing Zeffirelli to film them in the nude without their knowledge. The suit alleges that the actors feel this caused them to suffer through emotional damage and mental anguish for decades after the film&#x27;s success, and left them with careers that failed to reflect that success. Zeffirelli&#x27;s son responded to the lawsuit critically, calling it &quot;embarrassing&quot; that Hussey and Whiting filed the suit &quot;55 years after filming&quot; and that they owe their entire careers to the success of the film.

The lawsuit was later dismissed on 25 May 2023, by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Alison Mackenzie, who stated that the case did not meet the requirements for suspending the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse. Mackenzie also criticized the plaintiffs for &quot;cherry picking&quot; which statutes applied to their case. Hussey and Whiting are allegedly planning to appeal the ruling, as well as file a separate lawsuit based on a much more &quot;recent Criterion DVD release of the film which would not be affected by the statute of limitations.&quot;

A second lawsuit was dismissed on 21 October 2024, by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Holly J. Fujie, in which Hussey and Whiting claimed that the Criterion physical media release triggered a new statute of limitations. The new lawsuit was filed under state and federal laws intended to combat &quot;revenge pornography&quot;, which prohibit non-consensual distribution of intimate images. Judge Fujie stated in full, &quot;A comparison of the 2023 release with the prior versions shows no significant visible improvement in the film, particularly in the bedroom scene, to the naked eye. Even in the absence of express consent, however, Plaintiffs&#x27; subsequent conduct in the decades that followed since the film&#x27;s original 1968 release speaks to Plaintiffs&#x27; implied ratification and approval of the film, including the bedroom scene. This includes, among others, appearances and statements made by Plaintiffs during interviews and attendance at film festivals, during which Plaintiffs did not object to the continuing release and distribution of the successive releases of the film.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

Two releases of the score of the film, composed by Nino Rota, have been made.

The film&#x27;s &quot;Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet&quot; was widely disseminated, notably in &quot;Our Tune&quot;, a segment of Simon Bates&#x27;s radio show. In addition, various versions of the theme have been recorded and released, including a highly successful one by Henry Mancini, whose instrumental rendition was a success in the United States during June 1969.

There are two different sets of English lyrics to the song.
* The film&#x27;s version is called &quot;What Is a Youth?&quot;, featuring lyrics by Eugene Walter, and sung by Glen Weston. This version has been released on the complete score/soundtrack release.
* An alternate version, called &quot;A Time for Us&quot;, features lyrics by Larry Kusik and Eddie Snyder. This version has been recorded by Johnny Mathis, Andy Williams and Shirley Bassey for her 1968 album &quot;This Is My Life&quot;. Josh Groban performed &quot;Un Giorno Per Noi&quot;, an Italian version of &quot;A Time for Us&quot;. Jonathan Antoine, a classically trained tenor from Great Britain, performed &quot;Un Giorno Per Noi&quot; as one of the tracks on his album &quot;Believe&quot;, released in August 2016.

A third version called &quot;Ai Giochi Addio&quot;, featuring lyrics by Elsa Morante and sung in the Italian version by Bruno Filippini, who plays the minstrel in the film, has been performed by opera singers such as Luciano Pavarotti and Natasha Marsh.

<text>The basal ganglia (BG) or basal nuclei are a group of subcortical nuclei found in the brains of vertebrates. In humans and other primates, differences exist, primarily in the division of the globus pallidus into external and internal regions, and in the division of the striatum. Positioned at the base of the forebrain and the top of the midbrain, they have strong connections with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, brainstem and other brain areas. The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of functions, including regulating voluntary motor movements, procedural learning, habit formation, conditional learning, eye movements, cognition, and emotion.

The main functional components of the basal ganglia include the striatum, consisting of both the dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle), the globus pallidus, the ventral pallidum, the substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus. Each of these components has complex internal anatomical and neurochemical structures. The largest component, the striatum (dorsal and ventral), receives input from various brain areas but only sends output to other components of the basal ganglia. The globus pallidus receives input from the striatum and sends inhibitory output to a number of motor-related areas. The substantia nigra is the source of the striatal input of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays an important role in basal ganglia function. The subthalamic nucleus mainly receives input from the striatum and cerebral cortex and projects to the globus pallidus.

The basal ganglia are thought to play a key role in action selection, aiding in the choice of behaviors to execute. More specifically, they regulate motor and premotor cortical areas, facilitating smooth voluntary movements.
 Experimental studies show that the basal ganglia exert an inhibitory influence on a number of motor systems, and that a release of this inhibition permits a motor system to become active. The &quot;behavior switching&quot; that takes place within the basal ganglia is influenced by signals from many parts of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, which plays a key role in executive functions. It has also been hypothesized that the basal ganglia are not only responsible for motor action selection, but also for the selection of more cognitive actions. Computational models of action selection in the basal ganglia incorporate this.

The basal ganglia are of major importance for normal brain function and behaviour. Their dysfunction results in a wide range of neurological conditions including disorders of behaviour control and movement, as well as cognitive deficits that are similar to those that result from damage to the prefrontal cortex. Those of behaviour include Tourette syndrome, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and addiction. Movement disorders include, most notably Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which involves degeneration of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra; Huntington&#x27;s disease, which primarily involves damage to the striatum; dystonia; and more rarely hemiballismus. The basal ganglia have a limbic sector whose components are assigned distinct names: the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area (VTA). There is considerable evidence that this limbic part plays a central role in reward learning as well as cognition and frontal lobe functioning, via the mesolimbic pathway from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens that uses the neurotransmitter dopamine, and the mesocortical pathway. A number of highly addictive drugs, including cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine, are thought to work by increasing the efficacy of this dopamine signal. There is also evidence implicating overactivity of the VTA dopaminergic projection in schizophrenia.

== Structure ==
In terms of the development of the nervous system in humans, the central nervous system is often classified based on the original three primitive brain vesicles: These primary vesicles form in the normal development of the neural tube of the embryo and initially include the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, in rostral to caudal (from head to tail) orientation. Later in development each section itself turns into smaller components. During development, the cells that migrate tangentially to form the basal ganglia are directed by the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences. The following table demonstrates this developmental classification and traces it to the anatomic structures found in the basal ganglia. The structures relevant to the basal ganglia are shown in bold.

The basal ganglia form a fundamental component of the cerebrum. In contrast to the cortical layer that lines the surface of the forebrain, the basal ganglia are a collection of distinct masses of gray matter lying deep in the brain not far from the junction of the thalamus. They lie to the side of and surround the thalamus. Like most parts of the brain, the basal ganglia consist of left and right sides that are virtual mirror images of each other.

In terms of anatomy, the basal ganglia are divided into four distinct structures, depending on how superior or rostral they are (in other words depending on how close to the top of the head they are): Two of them, the striatum and the pallidum, are relatively large; the other two, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus, are smaller. In the illustration to the right, two coronal sections of the human brain show the location of the basal ganglia components. Of note, and not seen in this section, the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra lie farther back (posteriorly) in the brain than the striatum and pallidum.

===Striatum===
The striatum is a subcortical structure generally divided into the dorsal striatum and ventral striatum. The dorsal striatum is further divided into a dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum.

The striatum is composed mostly of medium spiny neurons. These GABAergic neurons project to the external (lateral) globus pallidus and internal (medial) globus pallidus as well as the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The projections into the globus pallidus and substantia nigra are primarily dopaminergic, although enkephalin, dynorphin and substance P are expressed. The striatum also contains interneurons that are classified into nitrergic neurons (due to use of nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter), tonically active (i.e. constantly releasing neurotransmitter unless inhibited) cholinergic interneurons, parvalbumin-expressing neurons and calretinin-expressing neurons. The dorsal striatum receives significant glutamatergic inputs from the cortex, as well as dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra pars compacta. The dorsal striatum is generally considered to be involved in sensorimotor activities. The ventral striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from the limbic areas as well as dopaminergic inputs from the VTA, via the mesolimbic pathway. The ventral striatum is believed to play a role in reward and other limbic functions. The dorsal striatum is divided into the caudate and putamen by the internal capsule while the ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The caudate has three primary regions of connectivity, with the head of the caudate demonstrating connectivity to the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and amygdala. The body and tail show differentiation between the dorsolateral rim and ventral caudate, projecting to the sensorimotor and limbic regions of the striatum respectively. Striatopallidal fibres connect the striatum to the pallidus.

===Pallidum===
The &quot;pallidum&quot; consists of a large structure called the globus pallidus (&quot;pale globe&quot;) together with a smaller ventral extension called the ventral pallidum. The globus pallidus appears as a single neural mass, but can be divided into two functionally distinct parts, the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the external globus pallidus (GPe). Both segments contain primarily GABAergic neurons, which therefore have inhibitory effects on their targets. The two segments participate in distinct neural circuits. The GPe receives input mainly from the striatum, and projects to the subthalamic nucleus. The GPi receives signals from the striatum via the &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; pathways. Pallidal neurons operate using a disinhibition principle. These neurons fire at steady high rates in the absence of input, and signals from the striatum cause them to pause or reduce their rate of firing. Because pallidal neurons themselves have inhibitory effects on their targets, the net effect of striatal input to the pallidum is a reduction of the tonic inhibition exerted by pallidal cells on their targets (disinhibition) with an increased rate of firing in the targets.

===Substantia nigra===
The substantia nigra is a midbrain gray matter portion of the basal ganglia that has two parts – the pars compacta (SNc) and the pars reticulata (SNr). SNr often works in unison with GPi, and the SNr–GPi complex inhibits the thalamus. Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) however, produces the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is very significant in maintaining balance in the striatal pathway. The circuit portion below explains the role and circuit connections of each of the components of the basal ganglia.

===Subthalamic nucleus===

The subthalamic nucleus is a diencephalic gray matter portion of the basal ganglia, and the only portion of the ganglia that produces an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. The role of the subthalamic nucleus is to stimulate the SNr–GPi complex and it is part of the indirect pathway. The subthalamic nucleus receives inhibitory input from the external part of the globus pallidus and sends excitatory input to the GPi.

===Circuit connections===

Multiple models of basal ganglia circuits and function have been proposed, however there have been questions raised about the strict divisions of the direct and indirect pathways, their possible overlap and regulation. The circuitry model has evolved since the first proposed model in the 1990s by DeLong in the parallel &quot;processing model&quot;, in which the cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta project into the dorsal striatum giving rise to an inhibitory indirect and excitatory direct pathway.
*The inhibitory indirect pathway involved the inhibition of the globus pallidus externus, allowing for the disinhibition of the globus pallidus internus (through STN) allowing it to inhibit the thalamus.
*The direct or excitatory pathway involved the disinhibition of the thalamus through the inhibition of the GPi/SNr. However the speed of the direct pathway would not be concordant with the indirect pathway in this model leading to problems with it. To get over this, a hyperdirect pathway where the cortex sends glutamatergic projections through the subthalamic nucleus exciting the inhibitory GPe under the &quot;center surround model&quot;, as well as a shorter indirect pathway have been proposed.

While implemented as a gradient without exact borders (or septa within the nuclei), the basal ganglia circuitry has often been divided into five pathways: one limbic, two associative (prefrontal), one oculomotor, and one motor pathway. The motor and oculomotor pathways are sometimes grouped into one motor pathway. Furthermore, a simplified scheme into three domains (motor, associative and limbic) has gained popularity. The five general pathways are organized as follows:

*The motor loop involving projections from the supplementary motor area, arcuate premotor area, primary motor cortex and somatosensory cortex into the putamen, which projects into the ventrolateral GPi and caudolateral SNr which projects into the cortex through the ventralis lateralis pars medialis and ventralis lateralis pars oralis.
*The oculomotor loop involved projections from the frontal eye fields, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the posterior parietal cortex into the caudate, into the caudal dorsomedial GPi and ventrolateral SNr, finally looping back into the cortex through the lateral ventralis anterior pars magnocellularis(VAmc).
*The first cognitive/associative pathway proposes a pathway from the DLPFC, into the dorsolateral caudate, followed by a projection into the lateral dorsomedial GPi, and rostral SNr before projecting into the lateral VAmc and medial pars magnocellularis.
*The second cognitive/associative pathway proposed is a circuit projecting from the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, the temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex into the ventromedial caudate, followed by a projection into the lateromedial GPi, and rostrolateral SNr before looping into the cortex via the medial VAmc and medial magnocellularis.
*The limbic circuit involving the projections from the ACC, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and insula into the ventral striatum, then into the rostrodorsal GPi, ventral pallidum and rostrodorsal SNr, followed by a loop back into the cortex through the posteromedial part of the medial dorsal nucleus. However, more subdivisions of loops have been proposed, up to 20,000.

These circuits are known to interact (at least) on a cortico-cortical level (U-fibers), a cortico-striatal level (by diffuse projections from cortex to striatum), a thalamo-cortical level (by diffuse reciprocal connections across thalamus and cortex) and striato-nigral level. The latter interaction has been characterized in more detail by Suzanne Haber and colleagues in their &#x27;spiral model&#x27;, which postulated how the ventral striatum (limbic circuit) can influence the dorsal striatum (motor circuit) through the midbrain dopamine cells (ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta and other regions). In this model, connections from the ventral tegmental area to the shell region of the nucleus accumbens form a “closed,” reciprocal loop. However, these projections also extend laterally to influence dopamine neurons that send signals to the rest of the ventral striatum, creating the initial segment of a feed-forward loop, or &#x27;spiral&#x27;. This spiral continues through striato-nigro-striatal pathways, whereby the VS affects cognitive and motor striatal areas via midbrain dopamine neurons.

The direct pathway, originating in the dorsal striatum inhibits the GPi and SNr, resulting in a net disinhibition or excitation of the thalamus. This pathway consists of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that express dopamine receptor D1, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4, and adenosine receptor A1. The direct pathway has been proposed to facilitate motor actions, timing of motor actions, gating of working memory, and motor responses to specific stimuli.

The (long) indirect pathway originates in the dorsal striatum and inhibits the GPe, resulting in disinhibition of the GPi which is then free to inhibit the thalamus. This pathway consists of MSNs that express dopamine receptor D2, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, and adenosine receptor A2a. This pathway has been proposed to result in global motor inhibition(inhibition of all motor activity), and termination of responses. Another shorter indirect pathway has been proposed, which involves cortical excitation of the subthalamic nucleus resulting in direct excitation of the GPe, and inhibition of the thalamus. This pathway is proposed to result in inhibition of specific motor programs based on associative learning.

A combination of these indirect pathways resulting in a hyperdirect pathway that results in inhibition of basal ganglia inputs besides one specific focus has been proposed as part of the &quot;center surround theory&quot;. This hyperdirect pathway is proposed to inhibit premature responses, or globally inhibit the basal ganglia to allow for more specific top down control by the cortex.

The interactions of these pathways are currently under debate. Some say that all pathways directly antagonize each other in a &quot;push pull&quot; fashion, while others support the &quot;center surround theory&quot;, in which one focused input into the cortex is protected by inhibition of competing inputs by the rest of the indirect pathways.

===Neurotransmitters===
The basal ganglia receive many afferent glutamatergic inputs, with predominantly GABAergic efferent fibers, modulatory cholinergic pathways, significant dopamine in the pathways originating in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, as well as various neuropeptides. Neuropeptides found in the basal ganglia include substance P, neurokinin A, cholecystokinin, neurotensin, neurokinin B, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, dynorphin, enkephaline. Other neuromodulators found in the basal ganglia include nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and phenylethylamine.

===Functional connectivity===
The functional connectivity, measured by regional co-activation during functional neuroimaging studies, is broadly consistent with the parallel processing models of basal ganglia function. The putamen was generally coactivated with motor areas such as the supplementary motor area, caudal anterior cingulate cortex and primary motor cortex, while the caudate and rostral putamen were more frequently coactivated with the rostral ACC and DLPFC. The ventral striatum was significantly associated with the amygdala and hippocampus, which although was not included in the first formulations of basal ganglia models, has been an addition to more recent models.

== Function ==

===Eye movements=== 
One intensively studied function of the basal ganglia is its role in controlling eye movements. Eye movement is influenced by an extensive network of brain regions that converges on a midbrain area called the superior colliculus (SC). The SC is a layered structure whose layers form two-dimensional retinotopic maps of visual space. A &quot;bump&quot; of neural activity in the deep layers of the SC drives an eye movement directed toward the corresponding point in space.

The SC receives a strong inhibitory projection from the basal ganglia, originating in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Neurons in the SNr usually fire continuously at high rates, but at the onset of an eye movement they &quot;pause&quot;, thereby releasing the SC from inhibition. Eye movements of all types are associated with &quot;pausing&quot; in the SNr; however, individual SNr neurons may be more strongly associated with some types of movements than others. Neurons in some parts of the caudate nucleus also show activity related to eye movements. Since the great majority of caudate cells fire at very low rates, this activity almost always shows up as an increase in firing rate. Thus, eye movements begin with activation in the caudate nucleus, which inhibits the SNr via the direct GABAergic projections, which in turn disinhibits the SC.

===Role in motivation===

Extracellular dopamine in the basal ganglia has been linked to motivational states in rodents, with high levels being linked to satiated state, medium levels with seeking, and low with aversion. The limbic basal ganglia circuits are influenced heavily by extracellular dopamine. Increased dopamine results in inhibition of the Ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata, resulting in disinhibition of the thalamus. This model of direct D1, and indirect D2 pathways explain why selective agonists of each receptor are not rewarding, as activity at both pathways is required for disinhibition. The disinhibition of the thalamus leads to activation of the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, selective for increased D1 activity leading to reward. There is also evidence from non-human primate and human electrophysiology studies that other basal ganglia structures including the globus pallidus internus and subthalamic nucleus are involved in reward processing.

===Decision making===

Two models have been proposed for the basal ganglia, one being that actions are generated by a &quot;critic&quot; in the ventral striatum and estimates value, and the actions are carried out by an &quot;actor&quot; in the dorsal striatum. Another model proposes the basal ganglia acts as a selection mechanism, where actions are generated in the cortex and are selected based on context by the basal ganglia. The CBGTC loop is also involved in reward discounting, with firing increasing with an unexpected or greater than expected reward. One review supported the idea that the cortex was involved in learning actions regardless of their outcome, while the basal ganglia was involved in selecting appropriate actions based on associative reward based trial and error learning.

===Working memory===

The basal ganglia has been proposed to gate what enters and what doesn&#x27;t enter working memory. One hypothesis proposes that the direct pathway (Go, or excitatory) allows information into the PFC, where it stays independent of the pathway, however another theory proposes that in order for information to stay in the PFC the direct pathway needs to continue reverberating. The short indirect pathway has been proposed to, in a direct push pull antagonism with the direct pathway, close the gate to the PFC. Together these mechanisms regulate working memory focus.

==Clinical significance==

Basal ganglia disease is a group of movement disorders that result from either excessive output from the basal ganglia to the thalamus – hypokinetic disorders, or from insufficient output – hyperkinetic disorders. Hypokinetic disorders arise from an excessive output from the basal ganglia, which inhibits the output from the thalamus to the cortex, and thus limits voluntary movement. Hyperkinetic disorders result from a low output from the basal ganglia to the thalamus which gives not enough inhibition to the thalamic projections to the cortex and thus gives uncontrolled/involuntary movements. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia circuitry can also lead to other disorders.

The following is a list of disorders, conditions, and symptoms that have been linked to the basal ganglia: 

==History==
The acceptance that the basal ganglia system constitutes one major cerebral system took time to arise. The first anatomical identification of distinct subcortical structures was published by Thomas Willis in 1664. For many years, the term corpus striatum was used to describe a large group of subcortical elements, some of which were later discovered to be functionally unrelated. For many years, the putamen and the caudate nucleus were not associated with each other. Instead, the putamen was associated with the pallidum in what was called the nucleus lenticularis or nucleus lentiformis.

A thorough reconsideration by Cécile and Oskar Vogt (1941) simplified the description of the basal ganglia by proposing the term striatum to describe the group of structures consisting of the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the mass linking them ventrally, the nucleus accumbens. The striatum was named on the basis of the striated (striped) appearance created by radiating dense bundles of striato-pallido-nigral axons, described by anatomist Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson (1912) as &quot;pencil-like&quot;.

The anatomical link of the striatum with its primary targets, the pallidum and the substantia nigra, was discovered later. The name &quot;globus pallidus&quot; was attributed by Déjerine to Burdach (1822). For this, the Vogts proposed the simpler &quot;pallidum&quot;. The term &quot;locus niger&quot; was introduced by Félix Vicq-d&#x27;Azyr as &quot;tache noire&quot; in (1786), though that structure has since become known as the substantia nigra, due to contributions by Von Sömmering in 1788. The structural similarity between the substantia nigra and globus pallidus was noted by Mirto in 1896. Together, the two are known as the pallidonigral ensemble, which represents the core of the basal ganglia. Altogether, the main structures of the basal ganglia are linked to each other by the striato-pallido-nigral bundle, which passes through the pallidum, crosses the internal capsule as the &quot;comb bundle of Edinger&quot;, and finally reaches the substantia nigra.

Additional structures that later became associated with the basal ganglia are the &quot;body of Luys&quot; (1865) (nucleus of Luys on the figure) or subthalamic nucleus, whose lesion was known to produce movement disorders. More recently, other areas such as the centromedian nucleus and the pedunculopontine complex have been thought to be regulators of the basal ganglia.

Near the beginning of the 20th century, the basal ganglia system was first associated with motor functions, as lesions of these areas would often result in disordered movement in humans (chorea, athetosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease).

===Terminology===
The nomenclature of the basal ganglia system and its components has always been problematic. Early anatomists, seeing the macroscopic anatomical structure but knowing nothing of the cellular architecture or neurochemistry, grouped together components that are now believed to have distinct functions (such as the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus), and gave distinct names to components that are now thought to be functionally parts of a single structure (such as the caudate nucleus and putamen).

The term &quot;basal&quot; comes from the fact that most of its elements are located in the basal part of the forebrain. The term ganglia is a misnomer: In modern usage, neural clusters are called &quot;ganglia&quot; only in the peripheral nervous system; in the central nervous system they are called &quot;nuclei&quot;. For this reason, the basal ganglia are also occasionally known as the &quot;basal nuclei&quot;. Terminologia anatomica (1998), the international authority for anatomical naming, retained &quot;nuclei basales&quot;, but this is not commonly used.

The International Basal Ganglia Society (IBAGS) informally considers the basal ganglia to be made up of the striatum, the pallidum (with two nuclei), the substantia nigra (with its two distinct parts), and the subthalamic nucleus, whereas Terminologia anatomica excludes the last two. Some neurologists have included the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus as part of the basal ganglia, and some have also included the pedunculopontine nucleus.

The basal ganglia form one of the basic components of the forebrain, and can be recognized in all species of vertebrates. Even in the lamprey (generally considered one of the most primitive of vertebrates), striatal, pallidal, and nigral elements can be identified on the basis of anatomy and histochemistry.

The names given to the various nuclei of the basal ganglia are different in different species. In cats and rodents the internal globus pallidus is known as the &quot;entopeduncular nucleus&quot;. In birds the striatum is called the &quot;paleostriatum augmentatum&quot; and the external globus pallidus is called the &quot;paleostriatum primitivum&quot;.

A clear emergent issue in comparative anatomy of the basal ganglia is the development of this system through phylogeny as a convergent cortically re-entrant loop in conjunction with the development and expansion of the cortical mantle. There is controversy, however, regarding the extent to which convergent selective processing occurs versus segregated parallel processing within re-entrant closed loops of the basal ganglia. Regardless, the transformation of the basal ganglia into a cortically re-entrant system in mammalian evolution occurs through a re-direction of pallidal (or &quot;paleostriatum primitivum&quot;) output from midbrain targets such as the superior colliculus, as occurs in sauropsid brain, to specific regions of the ventral thalamus and from there back to specified regions of the cerebral cortex that form a subset of those cortical regions projecting into the striatum. The abrupt rostral re-direction of the pathway from the internal segment of the globus pallidus into the ventral thalamus—via the path of the ansa lenticularis—could be viewed as a footprint of this evolutionary transformation of basal ganglia outflow and targeted influence.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Sound is an Academy Award that recognizes the finest or most euphonic sound mixing, recording, sound design, and sound editing. The award used to go to the studio sound departments until a rule change in 1969 said it should be awarded to the specific technicians, the first of which were Murray Spivack and Jack Solomon for &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;. It is generally awarded to the production sound mixers, re-recording mixers, and supervising sound editors of the winning film. In the lists below, the winner of the award for each year is shown first, followed by the other nominees. Before the 93rd Academy Awards, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing were separate categories.

For the second and third years of this category (i.e., the 4th Academy Awards and the 5th Academy Awards) only the names of the film companies were listed. Paramount Publix Studio Sound Department won in both years.

<doc id="99030" wikidata="Q3636043" url="?curid=99030" title="Bass fishing">
<text>Bass fishing is the recreational fishing activity, typically via rod-based angling, for various North American freshwater game fishes known collectively as &quot;black bass&quot;. There are numerous black bass species targeted in North America, including largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;), smallmouth bass (&quot;Micropterus dolomieui&quot;), spotted bass or Kentucky bass (&quot;Micropterus punctulatus&quot;), and Guadalupe bass (&quot;Micropterus treculii&quot;). All black bass species are members of the sunfish family Centrarchidae.

Modern bass fishing has evolved into a multibillion-dollar industry. The sport has changed drastically since its beginnings in the late 19th century. From humble beginnings, the black bass has become the most specifically sought-after sport fish in the United States. The sport has driven the development of all manner of fishing gear in the market, including rods, reels, lines, lures, electronic depth and fish-finding instruments, drift boats, float tubes, kayaks and also motor boats made specifically for bass fishing (colloquially called bass boats).

==Black bass==

All black bass are fished recreationally and are well known as strong fighters when hooked. Depending upon species and various other factors such as water quality and availability of food, black bass may be found in lakes, reservoirs, ponds, rivers, streams, creeks, and even roadside ditches. Largemouth are known for their greater overall size and tolerance of urban environments, and also tend to jump more than other black bass and fight aggressively near the surface. However, smallmouth bass tend to fight even more aggressively when hooked, favoring extremely powerful runs to underwater structures such as submerged logs, weed beds, and rock piles. The All-Tackle world record Black Bass was a largemouth that was caught at Montgomery Lake, GA by George Perry, weighing in at 22 lbs. 4 oz. Perry&#x27;s record fish, which some consider the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of all freshwater sport fishing records, was finally challenged by Japanese angler Manabu Kurita on July 22, 2009. Kurita&#x27;s catch was officially certified by the IGFA, weighing 22 lbs. 4 oz, the same weight as Perry&#x27;s legendary catch. There are also several stories of fish that may have exceeded this record weight, but only these two were officially certified. Perry and Kurita have shared the All-Take world record since 2009.

All black bass rely heavily on scent to forage, so care should be taken when fishing to ensure no foreign scents such as outdoor chemicals like sun block and bug spray, or any personal chemicals like tobacco, can deter the black bass. It is also important to wash hands frequently when handling fishing line, reels, rods, artificial baits, and particularly soft plastics. The flesh of smaller specimens is often white and flaky, with a mild, more pleasant taste when cooked.

==Background==
Bass fishing in the United States largely evolved on its own, and was not influenced by angling developments in Europe or other parts of the world. Indeed, modern British sea bass fishermen look to the United States freshwater bass techniques for inspiration for lure fishing and to the US, Japan and China for tackle. During the early-to-mid-19th century, wealthy sport anglers in the United States (mostly located in the northeastern portion of the country) largely confined themselves to trout and salmon fishing using fly rods. While smallmouth bass were sought by some fly fishermen, most bass fishing was done by sustenance anglers using poles and live bait. The working-class heritage of bass fishing strongly influenced the sport and is manifested even today in its terminology, hobbyist literature, and media coverage. Many people who began fishing for bass a long time ago simply used a long stick, with some sort of line, tied to a hook, and normally used live bait.

In the mid-19th century, the first artificial lure used for bass was developed in the form of an artificial fly. At first, these artificial fly patterns were largely derivations of existing trout and salmon flies. As time went on, new fly patterns were specifically developed to fish for bass, as well as heavier spinner/fly lures that could be cast by the baitcasting and fixed-spool casting reels and rods available at the time. Floating wooden lures (plugs) or poppers of lightweight cork or balsa were introduced around 1900, sometimes combined with hooks dressed with artificial fur or feathers. Production of the plastic worm began in 1949, but it was not until the 1960s that its use became popular. The plastic worm revolutionized the sport of bass fishing.

In the United States, the sport of bass fishing was greatly advanced by the stocking of largemouth and smallmouth bass outside their native ranges in the latter portion of the 19th century. As the nation&#x27;s railroad system expanded, large numbers of &#x27;tank&#x27; ponds were built by damming various small creeks that intersected the tracks to provide water for steam engines; later, new towns often sprang up alongside these water stops. Shippers found that black bass were a hardy species that could be transported in buckets or barrels via the railroad, sometimes using the spigot from the railroad water tank to aerate the fingerlings.
Largemouth bass were often stocked in tank ponds and warmer lakes, while smallmouth bass were distributed to lakes and rivers throughout the northern and western United States, as far west as California. Smallmouth were transplanted east of the Appalachians just before the Civil War, and afterwards introduced into New England.

Largemouth bass populations boomed after the U.S. Department of Agriculture began to advise and assist farmers in constructing and stocking farm ponds with largemouth bass, even offering advice on managing various fish species. Soon, those who had stocked largemouth bass on their farm ponds began to pursue them on a burgeoning number of new reservoirs and impoundments built in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s. These impoundments coincided with a postwar fishing boom, additional funds from sales of fishing licenses for the first large-scale attempts at bass fisheries management. This was especially true in the southern United States, where the largemouth bass thrived in waters too warm or turbid for other types of gamefish.

With increased industrialization and development, many of the nation&#x27;s eastern trout rivers were dammed, polluted, or allowed to silt up, raising water temperatures and killing off the native brook trout. Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers now too warm for native trout, and slowly became a popular gamefish with many anglers. Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range. Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by overdevelopment and industrial and agricultural pollution, as well as a loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers to form lakes or reservoirs. In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation&#x27;s rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.

==Rise of modern bass fishing==

By the early 20th century, bass fishing had been well established as a sport with its own following. Though the use of artificial lures for bass had begun with the artificial fly and fly fishing tackle, the bait casting rod and reel soon came to dominate the sport. Although fixed-spool reels were introduced in use in the United States as early as the 1870s, spinning reels and rods did not gain wide acceptance as an angling tool until the 1950s. Since that time, most bass anglers have used bait casting or spinning tackle, using either artificial lures or live bait (See Fishing rod, Fishing reel).

During the 1950s and 1960s, the development of specific angling tools for bass significantly increased angler bass catches and helped stimulate the development of the sport. Some of these innovations include the invention of monofilament nylon fishing lines, the fiberglass (later graphite composite) fishing rod, the electric trolling motor, the fish finder/depth locator, and new artificial lures and baits made of various plastics. Recently, advanced electronics that mimic the sounds of schooling bait fish have been introduced, and a controversy has arisen over the proper use of these devices in bass tournament fishing.

Since the early 1990s, fly fishing for bass, particularly smallmouth bass, has again become popular, using fly patterns, rods, and fly lines suited for bass. The Largemouth Bass is the most common sport fish in America. Many people are unaware that fly fishing is a growing source of bass catching, specifically in places where trophy bass are available such as Southern California and San Diego. Here prime Florida largemouth are some of the largest in the world and some of the toughest to catch. Several well known bass fishermen have been attracting attention to the fishery. Local fly shops offer services to pursue the fish which can be challenging. There are several very well known bass lakes here including; Lake Dixon, Lake Jennings, Miramar Reservoir, and Lake Murray (California).

Fishermen, conservation groups, and governmental wildlife departments have introduced black bass of various species across the world for the sport of fishing. Outside North America, Japan and South Africa have active programs.
Bass fishing as a sport was helped along by the chase for the standing world record which has held for over 75 years. Though surrounded by controversy it is widely accepted that in 1932 a 22-pound 4 ounce bass was caught by George Perry in Montgomery Lake, Georgia. It is one of the longest standing records in the sport of fishing. This record was tied on July 2, 2009 when Aichi Japan resident Manabu Kurita caught a 22-pound 4 ounce largemouth bass in Lake Biwa.

==Population management==
The increasing popularity of the sport combined with &quot;catch and release&quot; practices have in some cases led to an overpopulation of bass.

An overpopulated, stunted bass population can best be detected in the spring when all the bass are at least one year old. If virtually all the bass are 4 inches long or smaller, the population is probably stunted. Some indicators that a bass population is overpopulated:

# The largemouth bass caught are all less than 1 pound and are &quot;skinny&quot;.
# The bluegills are 1/2 pound and larger (too large for the bass to eat).

An overpopulation and/or stunting of bass may be caused by several factors including:

# Not enough bass being harvested.
# Too few bluegill or redear sunfish were stocked initially or they are failing to reproduce and the bass population does not have an adequate food supply.

It is posited that the easiest way to control an overpopulation of largemouth bass is by increasing the take of bass. This is clearly an effective method of thinning the bass population providing recreation at the same time. It may take two to three years to bring the population back into balance. If forage fish are scarce, stock adult bluegill or redear sunfish (7 to 8 inches long). These fish will be too large to be eaten by the bass. The large panfish will spawn in the spring and produce a supply
of forage. 

==Florida Bass Conservation Center==
The Florida Bass Conservation Center, located in Webster, Florida is a hatchery and research facility for healthy fish production and conservation of the Florida Large Mouth Bass. The hatchery also supplies fresh fish production of crappie, catfish, bream, trifold grass carp, striped bass and sunshine bass.

==Other species==
Black bass should not be confused with a multitude of unrelated fish species found around the world and called &quot;bass&quot;, such as the butterfly peacock bass (&quot;Cichla ocellaris&quot;), speckled peacock bass (&quot;Cichla temensis&quot;), Papuan black bass (&quot;Lutjanus goldiei&quot;) (also called Niugini bass), Australian bass, rock bass (&quot;Ambloplites rupestris&quot;), American striped bass, sand bass, and calico bass, white bass, and British sea bass (&quot;Dicentrarchus labrax&quot;).

==Competition==
In 1955 Earl Golding of the Waco Tribune Herald decided it was time to put the &quot;biggest fish tale&quot; to the test and organized the first ever bass tournament on Lake Whitney in Texas. Golding started with inviting 75 teams and 73 showed up to compete. The Central Texas Invitational was such a success that it evolved into the Texas State Bass Tournament that is still held today.

In 1967, Ray Scott founded the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.). This organization brought bass fishing tournaments to the mainstream; starting clubs across the United States and holding invitation only tournaments for the best anglers.

Modern day bass fishing competitions can take on many forms depending on the tournament trail, but the most common format is each angler weighs their 5 best fish each day over a 1 to 4-day span. Competitors are penalized heavily for dead fish and in some cases dead fish are not weighed. Fish turned in for weighing are immediately released or placed in tanks and treated for stress and glyco-protein (slime coat) injury, then released back into the water.

However, a new tournament trail known as Major League Fishing emerged in 2019 with a new format – weighing in every fish over 1 pound and immediately releasing them. This caught the eye of many top professional anglers, leading to a mass exodus from B.A.S.S.

=== United States ===
There are several major bass fishing competitions in the United States, with the three most dominant circuits being Major League Fishing, Bassmasters and the FLW series.

* Major League Fishing is a new trail for 2019 and organized by Bass Pro Shops. The trail brought over professionals like Michael Iaconelli, Kevin VanDam, Aaron Martens, Cliff Pace and Luke Clausen.
*The &quot;Bassmaster Tournament Trail&quot; is organized by the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS) and was started by Ray Scott, the &quot;father&quot; of competitive bass fishing. There are a handful of events in which anglers compete for prizing over $100,000 and a chance to make Bassmaster Classic.
* The &quot;Walmart FLW Tour&quot; was named after Forrest L. Wood of Ranger Boats fame. The top prize of the Forrest Wood Cup is $1 million. Both tours are nationally televised on networks like ESPN and Fox Sports Net, and covered extensively by news media.
* American Bass Anglers (ABA), formerly the Military Bass Anglers Association, award National championship tournament winners with a Triton Bass boat and Championship ring among other prizes. Thomas Wayne Jones Sr., from Springfield Tennessee won the 2007 ABA National championship.
* On the West Coast, WON BASS has been the main regional circuit in operation since the 1980s. Annually, WON BASS conducts the &quot;U.S. Open of Bass Fishing&quot; at Lake Mead, Nevada, which pays back nearly $500,000 per event. This is a test of both angling skill and endurance as the anglers compete for 3 days in the scorching hot sun and windy conditions of the Mojave Desert. Renowned anglers Rick Clunn, Byron Velvick, Aaron Martens, and Gary Klein have all been crowned champions during the Open&#x27;s 25-year history.

==== High school ====
The state of Illinois was the first to make competitive bass fishing a state-sanctioned high school sport in 2009. They offer 22 sectional tournaments which cater to 250 high school teams across the state. Teams which qualify at the sectional level compete for the state title in May.

States across the country have taken to Illinois&#x27; lead. Kentucky was the second to follow suit in 2012. Private groups have seen the opportunity to grow the industry as well through exposure of high school student to tournament bass fishing. The Bass Federation, for example, offers high school tournament series in over 40 states, eventually crowning a State Champion and giving them the opportunity to compete on the national level.

==== Collegiate ====
Competitive collegiate bass fishing circuits in the United States include FLW College Fishing, the Bassmaster College Series, and Cabela&#x27;s Collegiate Bass Fishing Series.

The FLW College Series includes three regional qualifiers in each of the five regions of the United States denoted by FLW. The top fifteen finishing teams in each of these regional qualifiers advance to the Regional Invitational tournament and have an opportunity to advance to the FLW College National Championship and fish for a place in the following year&#x27;s Forrest L Woods Cup Professional Bass Tournament.

Similarly, the Bassmaster College Series divides the nation into 5 regions. They only offer one qualifying opportunity at the regional level as opposed to the three offered by the FLW College Series. The top 15 from each of the 5 regional qualifiers advance directly to the Bassmaster College Series National Champion and compete for a position in the following year&#x27;s Bassmaster Classic.

The Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series is compiled of numerous tournaments accredited by the Association of Collegiate Anglers. The tournaments range in size from 20–30 boats all the way up to 100+ boats. The Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series compiles a ranking of &quot;School of the Year&quot; points, which are often coveted by schools across the country. These points are gathered through successful tournament finishes in tournaments recognized by the Association of Collegiate Anglers. Cabelas Collegiate Bass Fishing Series also hosts a large-scale national open. This is not the only one of its kind, as BoatUS also hosts a similar &quot;National Championship.&quot; Unlike the Bassmaster College Series and FLW College Series National Championships, these require no qualification from regional tournaments, and can be entered simply by signing up and paying the entry fee.

Indiana University was the first to establish a tournament fishing club in 1989, with Purdue University creating one soon afterwards. The University of Illinois was third to make a tournament bass fishing student organization, and the trend has grown tremendously ever since.

=== Other countries ===

Competitive bass fishing has also spread to anglers in other countries such as Japan, Korea, Italy, Australia and South Africa. , a Japanese angler living in Texas, won the 2004 Bassmaster Classic title. Australian tournaments are based on a native freshwater fish called Australian bass that is unrelated to largemouth bass.

== Professional Bass Angling ==
With the rise in popularity of competitive bass fishing came the multibillion-dollar industry of professional bass angling. The rise in popularity and the companies that have supported the sport have now made it possible to turn bass angling into a professional sport. A professional bass angler is a person who competes in bass fishing pro circuit and may also have company sponsorships. Some famous pro circuits include Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS), Walmart FLW Tour, and the Major League Fishing (MLF) Bass Pro Tour (BPT) .

Professional bass anglers are not able to simply sign up for these professional circuits. The angler must compete and win local and smaller events in order create a reputation. Many professional bass anglers also get company sponsorships. These sponsorships help fund the expenses of being a bass angler. In turn the angler is also promoting the company that they are sponsored by. A relatively new and popular technique for many fledgling pro anglers is to document and record their fishing adventures, and post them online in order to gain a following and attract even more sponsors. Being a professional bass angler is a full-time job. When the angler is not fishing, it is essential for them to attend public seminars and give presentations. It is the anglers job to market himself for the sponsors to become a more well known company.

Some of the most famous names in professional bass angling include Ray Scott, Kevin VanDam, Scott Martin, Bill Dance, Roland Martin, Jimmy Houston, Rick Clunn and Mike Iaconelli. Ray Scott is the founder of Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, otherwise known as BASS. Ray Scott started BASS in 1967 and has paved the way for professional circuits by starting the BASS Tournament Trail. Kevin VanDam is a professional competition angler who has won the BASSMASTER Classic four times. He also gained great fame by being named Angler of the Year in 1992. Mike Iaconelli is a professional competition angler in the BASS Elite Series, who has made a name for himself by winning BASSMASTER Classic and the Toyota Elite Series AOY.

Professional bass angling salaries fluctuate greatly depending on how marketable the angler is, in 2006 Kevin VanDam made $500,000 from his sponsors while Mike Iaconelli made $370,000. This does not include the prize money from winning competitions. Although there are some professionals that earn this much money, it is not the case for all of them. Gene Ellison the executive director of the Professional Anglers Association is quoted saying, &quot;more than half of the guys out here this weekend are going broke&quot;, during the BASSMASTER Classic of 2006.

In recent years the sport has not only reached out to men but to women as well. There is a large following of women bass fishing who are trying to become professional and have their own women circuit. The Lady Bass Anglers Association was started for that purpose.

<text>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a 1969 American Western buddy film directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman. Based loosely on fact, the film tells the story of Wild West outlaws Robert LeRoy Parker, known as Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman), and his partner Harry Longabaugh, the &quot;Sundance Kid&quot; (Robert Redford), who are on the run from a crack US posse after a string of train robberies. The pair and Sundance&#x27;s lover, Etta Place (Katharine Ross), flee to Bolivia to escape the posse.

In 2003, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The American Film Institute ranked &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; as the 73rd-greatest American film on its &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)&quot; list, and number 50 on the original list. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were ranked 20th-greatest heroes on &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains&quot;. &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; was selected by the American Film Institute as the 7th-greatest Western of all time in the AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list in 2008.

==Plot==

In 1899 Wyoming, Butch Cassidy is the affable, clever, talkative leader of the outlaw Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. His closest companion is the laconic dead-shot &quot;Sundance Kid&quot;. The two return to their hideout at Hole-in-the-Wall to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Cassidy&#x27;s long absences, have selected Harvey Logan as their new leader.

Logan challenges Cassidy to a knife fight over the gang&#x27;s leadership. Cassidy defeats him using trickery, but embraces Logan&#x27;s idea to rob a Union Pacific train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and thus reap more money than the first.

The first robbery goes well. To celebrate, Cassidy visits a favorite brothel in a nearby town, where the town marshal unsuccessfully attempts to organize a posse to track down the gang, only to have his address to the townsfolk hijacked by a friendly bicycle salesman. Sundance, meanwhile, visits his lover, schoolteacher Etta Place. Cassidy joins up with them the next morning, and takes Place for a ride on his new bike.

On the second train robbery, Cassidy uses too much dynamite to blow open the safe. The explosion demolishes the baggage car in the process and the money flies everywhere. As the gang scrambles to gather it, a second train arrives carrying a six-man team of lawmen. The crack squad pursues Cassidy and Sundance, who try to hide out in the brothel, and then to seek amnesty from Sheriff Bledsoe, to no avail.

The posse remains in pursuit, and it includes renowned Indian tracker &quot;Lord Baltimore&quot; and lawman Joe Lefors, recognizable by his white skimmer. Cassidy and Sundance elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Place that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head E. H. Harriman to remain on their trail until they are both killed.

Cassidy convinces Sundance and Place that the three should go to Bolivia, which he envisions as a robber&#x27;s paradise. On their arrival there, Sundance is dismayed by the living conditions and regards the country with contempt, but Cassidy remains optimistic. However, they know too little Spanish to pull off a bank robbery, so Place attempts to teach them the language. With her as an accomplice, they become successful bank robbers known as . However, their confidence drops after seeing a man wearing a white skimmer and fear that Harriman&#x27;s posse is still after them.

Cassidy suggests &quot;going straight&quot;, and he and Sundance land their first honest job as payroll guards for a mining company. However, they are ambushed by local bandits on their first run and their boss, Percy Garris, is killed. They kill the bandits, the first time Cassidy has ever shot someone. The duo concludes the straight life is not for them. Sensing they will be killed should they return to robbery, Place decides to return to the United States.

Cassidy and Sundance steal a payroll and a burro used to carry it, and arrive in a small town. A boy recognizes the burro&#x27;s livestock branding and alerts the police, leading to a gunfight with the outlaws. Cassidy has to make a desperate run to the burro to get ammunition, while Sundance provides covering fire. Wounded, the two take cover inside a building. Cassidy suggests their next destination should be Australia. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the two men, the local police have called on the Bolivian Army. The pair charge out of the building, guns blazing, into a hail of bullets from the massed troops who have occupied all the surrounding vantage points. The film ends with the sound of gunfire on a freeze-frame shot of the two bandits.

===Screenplay===
William Goldman first came across the story of Butch Cassidy in the late 1950s and researched intermittently for eight years before starting to write the screenplay. Goldman says he wrote the story as an original screenplay because he did not want to do the research to make it as authentic as a novel. Goldman later stated:
The whole reason I wrote the ... thing, there is that famous line that Scott Fitzgerald wrote, who was one of my heroes, &quot;There are no second acts in American lives.&quot; When I read about Cassidy and Longabaugh and the superposse coming after them—that&#x27;s phenomenal material. They ran to South America and lived there for eight years and that was what thrilled me: they had a second act. They were more legendary in South America than they had been in the old West ... It&#x27;s a great story. Those two guys and that pretty girl going down to South America and all that stuff. It just seems to me it&#x27;s a wonderful piece of material.

The characters&#x27; flight to South America caused one executive to reject the script, as it was then unusual in Western films for the protagonists to flee.

===Development===
According to Goldman, when he first wrote the script and sent it out for consideration, only one studio wanted to buy it—and that was with the proviso that the two lead characters did not flee to South America. When Goldman protested that that was what had happened, the studio head responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a shit. All I know is John Wayne don&#x27;t run away.&quot;

Goldman rewrote the script, &quot;didn&#x27;t change it more than a few pages, and subsequently found that every studio wanted it.&quot;

The role of Sundance was offered to Jack Lemmon, whose production company, JML, had produced the film &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967) starring Newman. Lemmon, however, turned down the role because he did not like riding horses and felt that he had already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kid&#x27;s character before. Other actors considered for the role of Sundance were Steve McQueen and Warren Beatty, who both turned it down, with Beatty claiming that the film was too similar to &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. According to Goldman, McQueen and Newman both read the scripts at the same time and agreed to do the film. McQueen eventually backed out of the film due to disagreements with Newman. The two actors would eventually team up in the 1974 disaster film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. Redford took the role as he liked the script. Jacqueline Bisset was a top contender for the role of Etta Place.

Filming locations include the ghost town of Grafton, Zion National Park, Snow Canyon State Park, and the city of St. George. These areas remain popular film tourism destinations, including the Cassidy Trail in Red Canyon.

==Soundtrack==

Burt Bacharach and Hal David wrote the song &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; for the film. Some felt the song had the wrong tone for a Western, but George Roy Hill insisted on its inclusion. Robert Redford, one of the stars of the film, was among those who disapproved of using the song, though he later acknowledged he was wrong:

===Personnel===
*Marvin Stamm − trumpet
*Pete Jolly − piano
*Hubert Laws − flute
*Bob Bain, Bill Pitman − guitar
*Tommy Tedesco − ukelele
*Carol Kaye − electric bass
*Emil Richards − percussion

==Release==

===Premieres===
The world premiere of the film was on September 23, 1969, at the Roger Sherman Theater, in New Haven, Connecticut. The premiere was attended by Paul Newman, his wife Joanne Woodward, Robert Redford, George Roy Hill, William Goldman, and John Foreman, among others. It opened the next day in New York City at the Penthouse and Sutton theatres.

===Home media===
The film became available on DVD on May 16, 2000, in a Special Edition that is also available on VHS.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film grossed $82,625 in its opening week from two theatres in New York City. The following week it expanded and became the number one film in the United States and Canada for two weeks. It went on to earn $15 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada by the end of 1969. According to Fox records the film required $13,850,000 in rentals to break even and by December 11, 1970, had made $36,825,000 so made a considerable profit to the studio. It eventually returned $45,953,000 in rentals.

With a final US gross of over $100 million, it was the top-grossing film released in 1969.

It was the eighth-most-popular film of 1970 in France.

===Critical response===
After release, reviewers gave the film mediocre grades, and New York and national reviews were &quot;mixed to terrible&quot; although better elsewhere, screenwriter William Goldman recalled in his book &quot;Which Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot;.

&quot;New York Times&quot; film reviewer Vincent Canby wrote that the film is &quot;very funny in a strictly contemporary way&quot;, but said that &quot;at the heart of the film there is a gnawing emptiness that can&#x27;t be satisfied by an awareness that Hill and Goldman knew exactly what they were doing---making a very slick movie&quot;. He described the &quot;Raindrops&quot; sequence as part of an effort to &quot;play tricks on the audience&quot; by &quot;taking short cuts to lyricism&quot;. The performers, Canby wrote, &quot;succeed although the movie does not&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine said the film&#x27;s two male stars are &quot;afflicted with cinematic schizophrenia. One moment they are sinewy, battered remnants of a discarded tradition. The next, they are low comedians whose chaffing relationship—and dialogue—could have been lifted from a Batman and Robin episode.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; criticized the &quot;Raindrops&quot; sequence and the &quot;scat-singing sound track by Burt Bacharach at his most cacophonous&quot;, which it said made the film &quot;absurd and anachronistic&quot;.

Roger Ebert scored the film at two and a half out of four. He praised its beginning and the three lead actors, but felt it progressed too slowly and had an unsatisfactory ending. But after Harriman hires his posse, Ebert thought the quality declined: &quot;Hill apparently spent a lot of money to take his company on location for these scenes, and I guess when he got back to Hollywood he couldn&#x27;t bear to edit them out of the final version. So the Super-posse chases our heroes unceasingly, until we&#x27;ve long since forgotten how well the movie started.&quot; Ebert reaffirmed his review in 1989 stating that he still thought it was a &quot;turkey&quot; and was baffled by its success.

Gene Siskel also disliked the film stating he thought it was predictable and writing that it was &quot;too cute to be believed … not memorable&quot;. Siskel would later admit in 1989 that publishing his negative review was one of his first challenges as film critic, recalling that the editorial assistant was shocked that he was giving a bad review to a film starring Paul Newman and would give him a lesson that he had to be honest as a critic, no matter how unpopular his opinion.

==Legacy==

American movie reviewers have been widely favorable. The film holds an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews with an average score of 8.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With its iconic pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, jaunty screenplay and Burt Bacharach score, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; has gone down as among the defining moments in late-&#x27;60s American cinema&quot;.

The Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay eleventh on its list of 101 Greatest Screenplays ever written.

In 2003, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; was selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of &quot;The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made&quot;. In 2008, British film publication &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked the film #32 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;.

The film inspired the television series &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, starring Pete Duel and Ben Murphy as outlaws trying to earn an amnesty.

A parody titled &quot;Botch Casually and the Somedunce Kid&quot; was published in &quot;Mad&quot;. It was illustrated by Mort Drucker and written by Arnie Kogen in issue No. 136, July 1970.

Also in 1976, a made-for-television sequel to the film was released. &quot;Wanted: The Sundance Woman&quot; more heavily features Katharine Ross as Etta Place.

In 1979, &quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot;, a prequel, was released starring Tom Berenger as Butch Cassidy and William Katt as the Sundance Kid. It was directed by Richard Lester and written by Allan Burns. William Goldman, the writer of the original film, was an executive producer. Jeff Corey was the only actor to appear in the original and the prequel.

===Television adaptation===
In September 2022, Amazon Studios announced a television adaptation, starring Regé-Jean Page and Glen Powell. Joe and Anthony Russo will be executive producers under their AGBO production banner.

<doc id="99032" wikidata="Q1371693" url="?curid=99032" title="Hello, Dolly! (musical)">
<text>Hello, Dolly! is a 1964 musical with lyrics and music by Jerry Herman and a book by Michael Stewart, based on Thornton Wilder&#x27;s 1938 farce &quot;The Merchant of Yonkers&quot;, which Wilder revised and retitled &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; in 1954. The musical follows the story of Dolly Gallagher Levi, a strong-willed matchmaker, as she travels to Yonkers, New York, to find a match for the miserly &quot;well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire&quot; Horace Vandergelder.

&quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; debuted at the Fisher Theater in Detroit on November 18, 1963, directed and choreographed by Gower Champion and produced by David Merrick. It starred stage performer Carol Channing as Dolly Gallagher Levi, a role theatrical audiences of the world would forever associate with her. The show moved to Broadway in 1964, winning 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress in a Musical for Channing. The awards earned set a record which the play held for 37 years. The show album &quot;Hello, Dolly! An Original Cast Recording&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002. The album reached number one on the Billboard album chart on June 6, 1964, and was replaced the next week by Louis Armstrong&#x27;s album &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; Louis Armstrong also was featured in the film version of the show, performing a small part of the song &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;.

The show has become one of the most enduring musical theater hits, with four Broadway revivals and international success. It was also made into the 1969 film &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; by 20th Century Fox, which won three Academy Awards, including Best Score of a Musical Picture and was nominated in four other categories, including Best Picture at the 42nd Academy Awards.

==History==
The plot of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; originated in the 1835 English play &quot;A Day Well Spent&quot; by John Oxenford, which Johann Nestroy adapted into the farce &quot;Einen Jux will er sich machen&quot; (&quot;He Will Go on a Spree&quot; or &quot;He&#x27;ll Have Himself a Good Time&quot;) in 1842. Thornton Wilder adapted Nestroy&#x27;s play into his 1938 farcical play &quot;The Merchant of Yonkers&quot;. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; in 1954, expanding the role of Dolly (played by Ruth Gordon).

The role of Dolly Gallagher Levi was originally written for Ethel Merman but she turned it down, as did Mary Martin—although both eventually played it. Merrick then auditioned Nancy Walker, but he hired Carol Channing, who then went on to originate the role of Dolly. Director Gower Champion was not the producer&#x27;s first choice, but Hal Prince and others turned it down, among them Jerome Robbins and Joe Layton.

&quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; had rocky tryouts in Detroit, Michigan, and Washington, D.C. After receiving the reviews, the creators made major changes to the script and score, including the addition of the song &quot;Before the Parade Passes By&quot;. Initially called &quot;Dolly, A Damned Exasperating Woman&quot;, then &quot;Call on Dolly&quot;, Merrick revised the show&#x27;s title after hearing Louis Armstrong&#x27;s version of &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot;. The show became one of the most iconic Broadway shows of the latter half of the 1960s, and running for 2,844 performances, was the longest-running musical in Broadway history for a time.

==Synopsis==

Sources: Tams-Witmark Guide to Musical Theatre Masterworks Broadway

===Act I===

As the 19th becomes the 20th century, all of New York City is excited because brassy widow Dolly Gallagher Levi is in town (&quot;Call on Dolly&quot;). Dolly makes a living through what she calls &quot;meddling&quot; – matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and mandolin lessons (&quot;I Put My Hand In&quot;). She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself. Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace&#x27;s weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose&#x27;s vocation does not guarantee a steady living. Ambrose enlists Dolly&#x27;s help, and they travel to Yonkers, New York to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder&#x27;s Hay and Feed.

Horace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because &quot;It Takes a Woman&quot; to cheerfully do all the household chores. He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there. Dolly arrives in Yonkers and &quot;accidentally&quot; mentions that Irene&#x27;s first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace. Horace departs for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to mind the store in his absence.

Cornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers and have an adventure in New York. They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench as a pretext to close the store. Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay. She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she will enter them in the polka competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace. Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly all take the train to New York (&quot;Put on Your Sunday Clothes&quot;).

Irene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon. Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder. She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (&quot;Ribbons Down My Back&quot;). Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich. Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him. Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace&#x27;s clerk by day, he is a notorious New York playboy by night. Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire. Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics &quot;Alamo, remember the Alamo!&quot; (&quot;Motherhood March&quot;). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.

Dolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation. She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (&quot;Dancing&quot;). Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing. They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together. Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephraim behind her and to move on with life &quot;Before the Parade Passes By&quot;. She asks Ephraim&#x27;s permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him. Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance. She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.

===Act II===

Cornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn&#x27;t so sure. As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they&#x27;ve got &quot;Elegance&quot;. At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi&#x27;s return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be &quot;twice as lightning&quot; (&quot;The Waiters&#x27; Gallop&quot;). Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.

Cornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant. Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant&#x27;s opulence, order the menu&#x27;s most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (&quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;) She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace&#x27;s table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other&#x27;s. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change. Barnabay and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during &quot;The Polka Contest&quot;, but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.

Cornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he&#x27;ll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (&quot;It Only Takes A Moment&quot;). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn&#x27;t marry her if she were the last woman in the world. Dolly angrily bids him &quot;So Long, Dearie&quot;, telling him that while he&#x27;s bored and lonely, she&#x27;ll be living the high life. 

The next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life&#x27;s paths. A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign. Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephraim&#x27;s: &quot;Money is like manure. It&#x27;s not worth a thing unless it&#x27;s spread about, encouraging young things to grow.&quot; Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she&#x27;ll &quot;never go away again&quot; (&quot;Hello, Dolly&quot; (reprise)).

*Song cut before Broadway Opening, reinstated when Ethel Merman joined to play Dolly.
**Song was not included in the original version. During the tryouts in Detroit, Gower Champion invited Charles Strouse and Lee Adams to consult on improvements to the musical. David Merrick was aware of their involvement, but Jerry Herman was not, even though Strouse was under the impression that Herman knew about it. Strouse and Adams suggested re-working the ending of Act I, wrote a new song &quot;Before the Parade Passes By&quot; and sent it to Champion. By the time the next set of tryouts in Washington began, a different number with the same name, written by Herman, was included in the show. After Strouse and Adams threatened to sue the production, they were given a songwriting credit for the song. That conflict led to an eight-year-long feud between Champion and Michael Stewart on one side and Strouse and Adams on the other. The official songwriting credits as listed with ASCAP have Adams, Herman and Strouse as co-writers.
***Song replaced &quot;Come and Be My Butterfly&quot; during Broadway Run.

^Horace Vandergelder&#x27;s solo &quot;Penny in My Pocket&quot;, although it received rave responses out of town, was cut prior to the Broadway opening for reasons of time. For the 2017 Broadway Revival, it was added back in as the opening of Act Two in front of the curtain. It is not, however, included in the licensed version for stock and amateur productions from Tams Witmark.

The song &quot;Elegance&quot;, though credited to Herman, was written by Bob Merrill for the 1957 show &quot;New Girl in Town&quot; but deleted from the original production.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway production===
The musical, directed and choreographed by Gower Champion and produced by David Merrick, opened on January 16, 1964, at the St. James Theatre and closed on December 27, 1970, after 2,844 performances. Carol Channing starred as Dolly, with a supporting cast that included David Burns as Horace, Charles Nelson Reilly as Cornelius, Eileen Brennan as Irene, Jerry Dodge as Barnaby, Sondra Lee as Minnie Fay, Mary Jo Catlett as Ermengarde, and Igors Gavon as Ambrose. Although facing competition from &quot;Funny Girl&quot; with Barbra Streisand, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; swept the Tony Awards in 1964, winning awards in ten categories (out of eleven nominations) that tied the musical with the previous record keeper &quot;South Pacific&quot;, record that remained unbroken for 37 years until &quot;The Producers&quot; won twelve Tonys in 2001.
After Channing left the show, Merrick employed prominent actresses to play Dolly, including Ginger Rogers, who started on August 9, 1965; Martha Raye, starting on February 27, 1967; Betty Grable, from June 12, 1967, to November 5, 1967; Pearl Bailey (in an all-black version with Cab Calloway as Horace) starting on November 12, 1967 (with Thelma Carpenter as her alternate); Phyllis Diller, as of December 26, 1969; and Ethel Merman (after having turned down the lead at the show&#x27;s inception) from March 28, 1970, to December 27, 1970.

Two songs cut prior to the opening – typical belt style songs &quot;World, Take Me Back&quot; and &quot;Love, Look in My Window&quot; – were restored for Merman&#x27;s run. Jo Anne Worley was Channing&#x27;s original standby but she never went on. She later played Dolly in regional and summer stock productions. Bibi Osterwald was the standby for Dolly following Worley&#x27;s and Channings&#x27; departures, subbing for all the stars, including Bailey, despite the fact that Osterwald was white. Marie Bryant and Novella Nelson also covered for the role of Dolly. Bailey received a Special Tony Award in 1968.

The show received rave reviews, with &quot;praise for Carol Channing and particularly Gower Champion.&quot; The original production became the longest-running musical (and third longest-running show) in September 1970 in Broadway history up to that time, surpassing &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and then being surpassed in turn by &quot;Fiddler on the Roof.&quot; The run was not continuous, unlike &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, with several week-long breaks, including a week where the production moved to St. Louis. The Broadway production of &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; grossed $27 million. By August 1970, it had made a profit of $8.5 million against its $350,000 investment.

;Tour and regional Dollys
Mary Martin starred in a US tour, starting in April 1965 and playing in 11 cities. The production also toured in Japan, Korea and Vietnam for a special USO performance for U.S. troops.

After Channing left the Broadway show, she headed a second US tour beginning in September 1965. 18 months later, Rogers also joined the roadshow production. It ran for two years and nine months. Eve Arden and Dorothy Lamour were replacements. Grable led another touring company before joining the Broadway show. 

Bailey and Calloway headed an all-Black tour in 1967 prior to their Broadway run, which was given a second cast album. 

Carole Cook, (the second actress to play the title role, after Channing, appearing in Australia and New Zealand productions), Dorothy Lamour, Eve Arden, Ann Miller, Michele Lee, Edie Adams, and Yvonne De Carlo also played the role on tour. Betty White appeared with the Kenley Players as Dolly in the summer of 1979. Molly Picon appeared as Dolly in a 1971 production by the North Shore Music Theatre of Beverly, Massachusetts. Lainie Kazan starred in a production at the Claridge Atlantic City. Vicki Lawrence played the role twice, once for Sacramento Music Circus and once for Glendale Music Theatre. Both Tovah Feldshuh and Betsy Palmer played Dolly in productions by the Paper Mill Playhouse. Marilyn Maye also starred in several regional productions and recorded a full album of the score. 

=== Original Australian production ===
The Australian production was produced by J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd. and opened at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney on 27 March 1965. Carole Cook was imported to star, making her the second woman to play the role of Dolly Levi. Jack Goode played Horace, alongside Bill Millican as Cornelius, Jill Perryman as Irene, Tikki Taylor as Minnie Fay, and Brian Hannan as Barnaby.

Australian choreographer Betty Pounder was employed to stage the musical numbers. Jill Perryman served as understudy to Carole Cook. Nancye Hayes was featured in the ensemble as well as understudying the part of Irene Molloy.

After a successful season in Sydney, the show went on to play Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne, and His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Auckland in 1966.

==== Australian revivals ====
In 1995 a new Australian tour was presented by Gordon Frost. Jill Perryman, who starred as Irene Molloy in the 1965 production, starred as Dolly Levi. The production opened at the State Theatre, Melbourne, followed by Lyric Theatre, Brisbane, Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney, Festival Theatre, Adelaide and His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Perth.

The Production Company has staged &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; at the State Theatre, Melbourne twice: first in 2002, starring Amanda Muggleton, then again in 2017, starring Marina Prior.

===Original London production===
&quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; premiered in the West End at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on December 2, 1965, and ran for 794 performances. Champion directed and choreographed, and the cast starred Mary Martin as Dolly (after she, as well as Merman, had turned down the role for the original run of the show) and Loring Smith as Horace Vandergelder. Smith had created the Horace role in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Matchmaker&quot;, Johnny Beecher as Barnaby, Garrett Lewis as Cornelius, Mark Alden as Ambrose Kemper, and Marilynn Lovell as Irene Molloy. Dora Bryan replaced Martin from May 1966 until the show closed in October 1967.

===Revivals===
The show has been revived four times on Broadway:
*November 6, 1975 – December 28, 1975, Minskoff Theatre – Starring Pearl Bailey and Billy Daniels in an all-black production (42 performances)
*March 5, 1978 – July 9, 1978, Lunt-Fontanne Theatre – Starring Carol Channing and Eddie Bracken (147 performances)
*October 19, 1995 – January 28, 1996, Lunt-Fontanne Theatre – Starring Carol Channing and Jay Garner (116 performances)
*April 20, 2017 – August 25, 2018, Shubert Theatre – Starring Bette Midler and David Hyde Pierce (550 performances)

In the West End the show has been three times revived (to date, July 2024):
*1979 – Carol Channing headlining at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and Shaftesbury Theatre, with Eddie Bracken as Horace and Angela Curran as Ermengarde.
*January 3, 1984 – April 27, 1984 – Danny La Rue headlining at the Prince of Wales Theatre, with Lionel Jeffries as Horace, Mark Haddigan as Barnaby, and Jeremy Hawk as Rudolph.
*A third West End revival, headlined by Imelda Staunton under the direction of Dominic Cooke, played a limited ten-week season at the London Palladium from July 6 - September 14, 2024, with a July 18 press night. The production&#x27;s cast includes Andy Nyman (Horace), Jenna Russell (Irene), Harry Hepple (Cornelius) and Tyrone Huntley (Barnaby). This production had been scheduled to premiere on August 11, 2020 for a limited season at the Adelphi Theatre, its four-year postponement being due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

A 1989 UK tour of the show of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, directed and choreographed by Paul Kerryson, was headlined by Dora Bryan reprising her 1965-66 West End role. Bryan&#x27;s castmates included Norman Rossington as Horace and Kathryn Evans as Irene. Kerryson would subsequently direct the 2014 Curve Theatre (Leicester) production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, headlined by Janie Dee whose castmates included Laura Pitt-Pulford as Irene and Michael Xavier as Cornelius.

The 2009 Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot;, headlined by Samantha Spiro under the direction of Timothy Sheader, ran July 30 – September 12, with other cast members including Allan Corduner (Horace), Josefina Gabrielle (Irene), and Akiya Henry (Minnie Fay). The production was honored with the Olivier Award as the best London-area stage musical revival of 2009, also earning Olivier awards for leading lady Samantha Spiro and for choreographer Stephen Mear.

===2017 Broadway revival/national tour===

On January 19, 2016, it was announced that Bette Midler would play the title role in a Broadway revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;. Previews began March 15, 2017, officially opening on April 20, 2017, at the Shubert Theatre.

The production was produced by Scott Rudin, directed by Jerry Zaks and choreographed by Warren Carlyle. David Hyde Pierce played Horace Vandergelder. Other principal casting for this revival included Kate Baldwin as Irene Molloy, Gavin Creel as Cornelius Hackl, Jennifer Simard as Ernestina Money, Taylor Trensch as Barnaby Tucker, Will Burton as Ambrose Kemper, Melanie Moore as Ermengarde, and Beanie Feldstein as Minnie Fay. Donna Murphy played the role of Dolly at Tuesday evening performances beginning in June 2017, as well as covering Midler&#x27;s holiday dates. She played her final performance on January 7, 2018. Midler won the Tony for Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical, and Creel for Best Actor in a Featured Role in a Musical, at the 71st Tony Awards in 2017. 

Midler, Pierce, Trensch, and Feldstein left the production on January 14, 2018. Bernadette Peters took over the role of Dolly on January 20, 2018, and Victor Garber took over the role of Horace Vandergelder. Charlie Stemp assumed the role of Barnaby Tucker on January 20, 2018.

The production closed on August 25, 2018, with Midler and Hyde Pierce returning to play Dolly and Horace (respectively) from July 17, 2018, to closing.

Betty Buckley played the title role in the first national tour of the 2017 Broadway revival, which began performances in Cleveland, Ohio in October 2018 in the Connor Palace at Playhouse Square, after a tryout in Utica, New York in September 2018.

==Critical reception==
Opening night reviews of the original production were generally positive, and Carol Channing&#x27;s performance as Dolly Gallagher Levi was greatly acclaimed; however, some reviewers criticized the score and the libretto, implying that Channing&#x27;s performance was responsible for the efficacy of the show. In his review of the opening night performance, &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote

&quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ... Mr. Herman&#x27;s songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ... Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; for its warmth, color and high spirits.

John Chapman of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; lauded Carol Channing&#x27;s performance, declaring her &quot;the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today – big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a &quot;basso profundo&quot;.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say that Jerry Herman&#x27;s score is memorable.&quot; New York Post critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,

The fact that [&quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.

In the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, Walter Kerr wrote,

&quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse&#x27;s neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.

Kerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the &quot;lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them&quot;. John McClain of the New York Journal American particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that

Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion&#x27;s staging.

<text>James Francis Durante ( , ; February 10, 1893 – January 29, 1980) was an American comedian, actor, singer, and pianist. His distinctive gravelly speech, Lower East Side accent, comic language-butchery, jazz-influenced songs, and prominent nose helped make him one of the United States&#x27; most familiar and popular personalities of the 1920s through the 1970s. He often referred to his nose as &quot;the schnozzola&quot; (Italianization of the American Yiddish slang word &quot;schnoz&quot;, meaning &quot;big nose&quot;), and the word became his nickname.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Durante was born on the Lower East Side of New York City. He was the youngest of four children born to Rosa (née Lentino) and Bartolomeo Durante, both immigrants from Salerno, Campania, Italy. Bartolomeo was a barber. Durante served as an altar boy at St. Malachy Roman Catholic Church, known as the Actor&#x27;s Chapel.

===Early career===
Durante dropped out of school in seventh grade to become a full-time ragtime pianist. He played in piano bars under the name &quot;Ragtime Jimmy&quot; before he joined one of the first recognizable jazz bands in New York, the Original New Orleans Jazz Band. Durante was the only member not from New Orleans. His routine of breaking into a song to deliver a joke, with band or orchestra chord punctuation after each line, became a Durante trademark. In 1920 the group was renamed Jimmy Durante&#x27;s Jazz Band.

==Stardom==
By the mid-1920s, Durante had become a vaudeville star and radio personality in a trio named Clayton, Jackson and Durante. When the trio played Broadway&#x27;s famed Palace Theater during the week of June 4, 1928, Betty Felsen&#x27;s production of &quot;Ballet Caprice&quot; headlined the bill. Lou Clayton and Eddie Jackson, Durante&#x27;s closest friends, often reunited with Durante in subsequent years. Jackson and Durante appeared in the Cole Porter musical &quot;The New Yorkers&quot;, which opened on Broadway on December 8, 1930. Earlier the same year, the team appeared in the film &quot;Roadhouse Nights&quot;, ostensibly based on Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot;.

By 1934, Durante had a major record hit with his own novelty composition, &quot;Inka Dinka Doo&quot;, with lyrics by Ben Ryan. It became his theme song for the rest of his life. A year later, Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose stage musical &quot;Jumbo&quot;. Durante also appeared on Broadway in &quot;Show Girl&quot; (1929), &quot;Strike Me Pink&quot; (1934) and &quot;Red, Hot and Blue&quot; (1936).

During the early 1930s, Durante alternated between Hollywood and Broadway. Outstanding among his early motion pictures was &quot;The Phantom President&quot; (1932), starring George M. Cohan with Durante as his gregarious pal. Durante then replaced Cliff Edwards as the comic foil in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s Buster Keaton comedies: &quot;Speak Easily&quot; (1932), &quot;The Passionate Plumber&quot; (1932), and &quot;What! No Beer?&quot; (1933). Although his style of fast-talking comedy did not always mesh smoothly with the mimed visuals of Keaton, their series proved successful enough and might have continued. However, Keaton was experiencing personal problems including loss of control over his movies, alcohol abuse, and a messy divorce, so MGM fired Keaton and kept Durante. MGM gave Durante leads in moderately budgeted comedies like &quot;Meet the Baron&quot; (1933) and &quot;Hollywood Party&quot; (1934), but he couldn&#x27;t carry an entire feature film; he was more effective as somebody&#x27;s sidekick, and MGM released him in 1934.

Durante went to England to work in a Richard Tauber film musical, &quot;Land Without Music&quot; (released in the United States as &quot;Forbidden Music&quot;). Upon his return to Hollywood, there were no movie jobs for him. Columbia Pictures offered him a major role in its college musical &quot;Start Cheering&quot;, filmed in 1937, and he received excellent critical notices, re-establishing him in movies. From then on, he almost always appeared in strong supporting roles.

Durante went on to appear in the Gene Autry musical western &quot;Melody Ranch&quot; (1940), &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1942, playing Banjo, a character based on Harpo Marx), &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1945), &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot; (1962, based on the 1935 musical), and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963).

==Radio==
On September 10, 1933, Durante appeared on Eddie Cantor&#x27;s NBC radio show, &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;, continuing until November 12 of that year. When Cantor left the show, Durante took over as its star from April 22 to September 30, 1934. He then moved on to &quot;The Jumbo Fire Chief Program&quot; (1935–1936).

Durante teamed with Garry Moore for &quot;The Durante-Moore Show&quot; in 1943. Durante&#x27;s comic chemistry with the young, brush cut Moore brought Durante an even larger audience. &quot;Dat&#x27;s my boy dat said dat!&quot; became an instant catchphrase, which would later inspire the cartoon &quot;Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy&quot;. The duo was one of the nation&#x27;s favorites for the rest of the decade. Their Armed Forces Radio Network &quot;Command Performance&quot; with Frank Sinatra remains a favorite of radio-show collectors today. Moore left the duo in mid-1947, and the program returned October 1, 1947 as &quot;The Jimmy Durante Show&quot;. Durante continued the show for three more years and featured a reunion of Clayton, Jackson, and Durante on his April 21, 1948 broadcast.

==Television==
Durante first appeared on television showing up at the end of 1944 on John Reed King&#x27;s audience participation show on the local New York CBS television station WCBW (now WCBS-TV). His brief, unannounced, appearance on &quot;The Missus Goes a-Shopping&quot; seg apparently surprised most of the staff as well as the audience. Arrangements were made in the late afternoon for him to pop into camera range, which he did with the reported agility of a tele vet. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reviewed the appearance: &quot;Without script, rehearsal or make-up he went on and gave a top performance, proving that a star of Durante&#x27;s caliber shines in any entertainment medium. Aware of camera angle importance, Schnozzle played his profile for all its irregularity. His ad libbing was fast and funny&quot;. 

From 1950 to 1951, Durante was the host once a month (alternating with Ed Wynn, Danny Thomas, and Jack Carson) on NBC&#x27;s comedy-variety series &quot;Four Star Revue&quot;, airing on Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m. Jimmy continued with the show until 1954.

Durante then hosted a half-hour variety show, &quot;The Jimmy Durante Show&quot;, on NBC from October 2, 1954, to June 23, 1956.

Beginning in the early 1950s, Durante teamed with sidekick Sonny King, a collaboration that would continue until Durante&#x27;s death. Several times in the 1960s, Durante served as host of ABC&#x27;s variety hour &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, which was taped live (and consequently included ad-libs by the seasoned vaudevillian). His last regular television series paired him with The Lennon Sisters and was titled, appropriately, &quot;Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters&quot;. The series lasted for one season on ABC (1969–1970).

==Marriages==
Durante&#x27;s first wife was Jean &quot;Jeanne&quot; Olson, whom he married on June 19, 1921. She was born in Ohio on August 31, 1896. She was 46 years old when she died on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1943, after a lingering heart ailment of about two years, although different newspaper accounts of her death suggest she was 45 or perhaps 52. As her death was not immediately expected, Durante was touring in New York at the time and returned to Los Angeles right away to complete the funeral arrangements.
Durante&#x27;s radio show was bracketed with two trademarks: &quot;Inka Dinka Doo&quot; as his opening theme, and the invariable signoff that became another familiar national catchphrase: &quot;Good night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are.&quot; For years, no one knew who Mrs. Calabash referred to, and Durante preferred to keep the mystery alive until 1966. One theory was that it referred to the owner of a restaurant in Calabash, North Carolina, where Durante and his troupe had stopped to eat. He was so taken by the food, the service, and the chitchat that he told the owner that he would make her famous. Since he did not know her name, he referred to her as &quot;Mrs. Calabash&quot;. At a National Press Club meeting in 1966 (broadcast on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; program), Durante finally revealed that it was indeed a tribute to his wife. While driving across the country, they stopped in Calabash, a name she had loved. &quot;Mrs. Calabash&quot; became his pet name for her, and he signed off his radio program with &quot;Good night, Mrs. Calabash.&quot; He added &quot;wherever you are&quot; after the first year.

Durante married his second wife, Margaret &quot;Margie&quot; Little, at St. Malachy Roman Catholic Church in New York City on December 14, 1960. As a teenager she had been crowned Queen of the New Jersey State Fair. She attended New York University before being hired by the legendary Copacabana in New York City. She and Durante met there 16 years before their marriage, when he performed there and she was a hatcheck girl. She was 41 and he was 67 when they married. With help from their attorney, Mary G. Rogan, the couple were able to adopt a baby, Cecilia Alicia (nicknamed CeCe and now known as CeCe Durante-Bloum), on Christmas Day, 1961. CeCe became a champion horsewoman and then a horse trainer and horseriding instructor. Margie died on June 7, 2009, at the age of 89.

==Charitable work==
On August 15, 1958, for his charitable acts, Durante was awarded a three-foot-high brass loving cup by the Al Bahr Shriners Temple in San Diego, California. The inscription reads: &quot;JIMMY DURANTE THE WORLD&#x27;S MOST FAMOUS COMEDIAN. A loving cup to you Jimmy, it&#x27;s larger than your nose, but smaller than your heart. Happiness always, Al Bahr Temple, August 15, 1958.&quot; Jimmy Durante started out his career with Clayton and Jackson and when he became a big star and they were left behind, he kept them on his payroll for the rest of their lives.

Durante&#x27;s love for children continued through the Fraternal Order of Eagles, who among many causes raise money for disabled and abused children. At Durante&#x27;s first appearance at the Eagles International Convention in 1961, Judge Bob Hansen inquired about his fee for performing. Durante replied, &quot;Do not even mention money judge or I&#x27;ll have to mention a figure that&#x27;ll make ya sorry ya brought it up.&quot; &quot;What can we do then?&quot; asked Hansen. &quot;Help da kids,&quot; was Durante&#x27;s reply. Durante performed for many years at Eagles conventions free of charge, even refusing travel money. The Fraternal Order of Eagles changed the name of their children&#x27;s fund to the Jimmy Durante Children&#x27;s Fund in his honor, and in his memory have raised over $23 million to help children. A reporter once remarked of Durante after an interview: &quot;You could warm your hands on this one.&quot; One of the projects built using money from the Durante Fund was a heated therapy swimming pool at the Hughen School in Port Arthur, Texas. Completed in 1968, Durante named the pool the &quot;Inka Dinka Doo Pool&quot;.

==Religion==
Durante was deeply religious and a staunch Roman Catholic. In Las Vegas, he was seen regularly after Sunday Mass outside of the Guardian Angel Cathedral, standing next to the priest and greeting parishioners as they left the church. In 1968 he recorded 10 spiritual and inspirational songs for the album &quot;Songs for Sunday&quot;; it was expanded to 20 selections for a CD release under the same title in 1996.

==Politics==
Durante was an active member of the Democratic Party. In 1933, he appeared in an advertisement shown in theaters supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs and wrote a musical score titled &quot;Give a Man a Job&quot; to accompany it. He performed at both the inaugural gala for President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and a year later at the famous Madison Square Garden rally for the Democratic party that featured Marilyn Monroe singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to JFK.

==Later years and death==
Durante continued his film appearances through the popular 1963 &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; and a number of television appearances through the early 1970s. He narrated the Rankin-Bass animated Christmas special &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; (1969). The television work also included a series of commercial spots for Kellogg&#x27;s Corn Flakes cereals in the mid-1960s, which introduced Durante to millions of children. One of his last appearances was in a television commercial for the 1973 Volkswagen Beetle, where he proclaimed that the new, roomier Beetle had &quot;plenty of breathin&#x27; room... for de old schnozzola!&quot;

In 1963, Durante recorded the album of pop standards &quot;September Song&quot;. The album became a best-seller and provided Durante&#x27;s re-introduction to yet another generation, almost three decades later. &quot;Jimmy Durante&#x27;s Way of Life&quot; album featured his interpretation of the song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, which accompanied the opening credits of the romantic comedy hit &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, while his version of &quot;Make Someone Happy&quot; was in the film&#x27;s closing credits. Both are included on the film&#x27;s best-selling soundtrack. Durante also recorded a cover of the well-known song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot;, which became a trademark song on his 1960s TV show and was featured in the 2004 film &quot;The Notebook&quot;.

He wrote a foreword for a humorous book compiled by Dick Hyman, titled &quot;Cockeyed Americana&quot;. In the first paragraph of the &quot;Foreword!&quot;, as Durante called it, he describes meeting Hyman and discussing the book and the contribution that Hyman wanted Durante to make to it. Durante wrote, &quot;Before I can say gaziggadeegasackeegazobbath, we&#x27;re at his luxurious office.&quot; After reading the material Hyman had compiled for the book, Durante commented on it: &quot;COLOSSAL, GIGANTIC, MAGNANIMOUS, and last but not first, AURORA BOREALIS. &quot;[Capitalization Durante&#x27;s]&quot; Four little words that make a sentence—and a sentence that will eventually get me six months.&quot;

Durante retired from performing in 1972, following a stroke that left him reliant on a wheelchair. He made a public appearance in 1974 when MGM held a reunion of its former stars, in connection with its new &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; film.

Durante died as a result of pneumonia in Santa Monica, California, on January 29, 1980, 12 days before he would have turned 87. He received Catholic funeral rites four days later, with fellow entertainers Desi Arnaz, Ernest Borgnine, Marty Allen, and Jack Carter in attendance, and was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

==Animation==
Durante is known to most modern audiences as the character who narrated the 1969 animated special &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;. He also performed the title song of the 1968 comedy-adventure movie &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust!&quot; (titled &quot;Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies&quot; in the U.S.) over the film&#x27;s animated opening credits.

===Allusions and references in animation===
While his own career in animation was limited, Durante&#x27;s distinctive voice, looks, and catchphrases earned him numerous depictions and allusions in animation. He was caricatured as early as 1933, alongside Buster Keaton in the Ub Iwerks cartoon &quot;Soda Squirt&quot;. Director Tex Avery presented him as a persecuted turkey in the MGM cartoon &quot;Jerky Turkey&quot;. In MGM&#x27;s Tom and Jerry cartoons with father-and-son bulldogs Spike and Tyke, Durante was referenced with a raspy voice and an affectionate &quot;Dat&#x27;s my boy!&quot; In another Tom and Jerry short, &quot;Surf-Bored Cat&quot;, a starfish lands on Tom&#x27;s head, giving him a big nose. He then proceeds with Durante&#x27;s famous &quot;Ha-cha-cha-cha&quot; call. The 1943 Tex Avery cartoon &quot;What&#x27;s Buzzin&#x27; Buzzard&quot; featured a vulture with a voice that sounded like Jimmy Durante. Hanna-Barbera continued to use the Durante voice (imitated by Doug Young) in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy&quot; cartoons, Doggie Daddy invariably addressing the junior dachshund with a Durante-like &quot;Augie, my son, my son&quot;, and with frequent citations of, &quot;That&#x27;s my boy who said that!&quot;

Many &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons had characters based on Durante, using lines like &quot;Umbriago&quot;, &quot;Everybody wants to get into the act&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m mortified!&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m disgustipated&quot;, &quot;Those are the conditions that prevail&quot;, &quot;I got a million of them!&quot; and &quot;Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha&quot; from his films, songs and radio acts. One Harman-Ising short from 1933, &quot;Bosko&#x27;s Picture Show&quot;, featured a caricature of Adolf Hitler chasing Durante with a meat cleaver. Three examples from the 1940s include &quot;A Gruesome Twosome&quot;, which features a cat based on Durante, and &quot;Baby Bottleneck&quot;, which in unedited versions opens with a Durante-like stork. He also appears as a walrus in the 1945 United States Armed Forces World War II-era training film &quot;In the Aleutians – Isles of Enchantment&quot;. &quot;Book Revue&quot; shows the well-known (at that time) 1924 Edna Ferber novel &quot;So Big&quot; featuring a Durante caricature on the cover. The &quot;so big&quot; refers to his nose, and as a runaway criminal turns the corner by the book, Durante turns sideways using his nose to trip the criminal, allowing his capture. In &quot;Hollywood Daffy&quot;, Durante is directly depicted as himself, pronouncing his catchphrase &quot;Those are the conditions that prevail!&quot; In &quot;The Mouse-Merized Cat&quot;, Catstello (a Lou Costello mouse) briefly is hypnotized to imitate Jimmy Durante singing &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot;. One of Durante&#x27;s common catchphrases &quot;I got a million of &#x27;em!&quot; was used as Bugs&#x27; final line in &quot;Stage Door Cartoon&quot;.

A Durante-like voice was also used for Marvel Comics superhero the Thing in the Hanna-Barbera cartoon &quot;Fred and Barney Meet the Thing&quot;. The voice and appearance of Crispy, the mascot for Crispy Critters cereal, was also based on Durante. In &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, a character named Mortimer Mouse (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) was based on Durante, complete with the &quot;ha-cha-cha!&quot;. One of the main characters in Terrytoons&#x27; Heckle and Jeckle cartoon series also takes to imitating Jimmy in 1948&#x27;s &quot;Taming The Cat&quot; (&quot;Get a couple of song birds today...&quot;).

==Legacy==
Since Durante&#x27;s death, his songs have featured in several films. Dan Aykroyd and Kim Basinger performed impressions of Durante from &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, singing &quot;Did You Ever Have the Feeling&quot; in 1988&#x27;s &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot;. His performance of &quot;Young at Heart&quot; was featured in &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991), and his versions of &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; and &quot;Make Someone Happy&quot; played over the opening and closing credits of &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993). Michael J. Fox performed an impression of Durante singing &quot;Inka Dinka Doo&quot; in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Greedy&quot;. His rendition of &quot;Smile&quot; was in the film &quot;Joker&quot; (2019) and its trailer. His rendition of &quot;The Glory of Love&quot; was also used in the end credits of the horror film &quot;Orphan&quot; (2009), and in its prequel, &quot;&quot; (2022), with a rendition of it sung by Isabelle Fuhrman. His song &quot;The Day I Read a Book&quot; is regularly played on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition&quot; before author interviews and reviews.
Also featured in sketches by British Comedians Morecambe &amp; Wise.

<text>Carlos Antonio Romero Barceló (September 4, 1932 – May 2, 2021) was a Puerto Rican politician who served as the governor of Puerto Rico from 1977 to 1985. He was the second governor to be elected from the New Progressive Party (PNP). He also served on several other political positions including Mayor of San Juan from 1969 to 1977 and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in United States Congress from 1993 to 2001.

Romero Barceló was the grandson of Antonio R. Barceló, a Union Party leader and advocate of Puerto Rican independence during the early 20th century, and the son of Josefina Barceló, the first woman to preside over a major political party in Puerto Rico.

Romero Barceló was born in 1932 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the son of Antonio Romero Moreno and Josefina Barceló Bird. His father was a lawyer and engineer who served as a superior court judge. His maternal grandfather was Antonio Rafael Barceló the son of Jaime José Barceló Miralles from Palma, Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain and Josefa Martínez de León from Naguabo.

==Education==
Carlos Romero Barceló attended Phillips Exeter Academy in the state of New Hampshire, graduating in 1949. Later he attended Yale University, obtaining a B.A. in Political Science and Economics in 1953. That same year, at age 21, he returned to Puerto Rico and enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico Law School, becoming a licensed lawyer in 1956.

==Political career==
Romero Barceló, an avid supporter of Puerto Rico statehood with the United States of America, became involved with the &quot;Partido Estadista Republicano&quot;, the forerunner of the New Progressive Party, which at the time was led by Miguel Angel Garcia Mendez. He formed part of &quot;Ciudadanos pro Estado 51&quot; (Citizens for the 51st State) in 1965. Later, he was one of the founder&#x27;s of the pro-statehood group &quot;Estadistas Unidos&quot;, founded by Luis Ferre.

===Mayor===
Romero was one of the founding members of the New Progressive Party in 1967. The following year he was elected Mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, succeeding the legendary &quot;doña Fela&quot; (Felisa Rincón de Gautier) and becoming the first popularly elected mayor of San Juan, since previous mayors were elected by the San Juan City Council, not directly by the electorate. During his second term, in 1973, he became the first Hispanic to become vice-president of the National League of Cities and in 1974 became president of the organization. He served as mayor until 1976 when he defeated incumbent governor of Puerto Rico Rafael Hernández Colón. While Hernán Padilla was elected to succeed him, technically, his immediate successor was Carlos S. Quirós, his Vice Mayor who became full mayor for over a week until Padilla&#x27;s term began. Some of his notable accomplishments as mayor were the inclusion of San Juan into U.S. President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Model Cities Program, which changed the face of the slum called &quot;El Fanguito&quot; to become the area of the &quot;new&quot; San Juan where modern facilities such as the San Juan Natatorium, the Puerto Rico Coliseum and numerous residential condominium projects were eventually built; the construction of the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and the first municipal educational institution of Puerto Rico: the Colegio Universitario de San Juan.

===Governor===
Romero Barceló brought well-received economic resolutions to the island during his terms in office, emphasizing the island&#x27;s tourism potential. However, during his administration the economy recovered sluggishly, with unemployment dropping to 17% in 1979 from 19.0% in 1975, a disappointing 2% decline. The economy did not fully recover, and the island&#x27;s government services deteriorated during his term in office. Moreover, his statements declaring the policemen that carried out the Maravilla murders to be heroes damaged his image.

In 1980 he was elected for a second term as governor by a margin of 3,037 votes again over PPD-candidate Rafael Hernández Colón. The 1980 gubernatorial elections were among the closest in Puerto Rican history, requiring the intervention of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico to rule whether improperly cast ballots should be counted. In particular, the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association under Luis Fortuño generated over 1,500 absentee ballots for Romero Barceló that proved an important factor in his re-election. However, the New Progressive Party lost control of the legislature, and party-affiliated mayors won in only 28 of the 78 municipalities on the island. The 1980 elections were the most controversial as many PPD followers said that the elections were stolen in which the PPD won the elections except for the governor candidacy in which almost every election the parties win with straight-party ballots.
This election was similar to the 2004 and 2012 elections, decided by less-than-one-percent margins.

In his second term Puerto Rico was badly hit by a severe recession starting in 1980 and ending in 1983,
the unemployment drastically rose to 25% in 1983 the highest since the Great Depression.

Romero Barceló is frequently associated with the &quot;Cerro Maravilla Incident&quot; of 1978 in which two young pro-Independence activists at Cerro Maravilla were killed at the hands of rogue members of the Puerto Rican Police after being lured by the police to a mountainous area that housed communications and television towers. The tragic incident was investigated several times by the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the F.B.I., and was widely reported on by the local press. In 1984, 10 police officers were indicted and found guilty of perjury, destruction of evidence, and obstruction of justice, with four being convicted of second-degree murder.

He sought re-election for a third term in 1984 but was defeated by Rafael Hernández Colón. After the elections, Romero-Barceló&#x27;s reaction to the defeat, in response to TV news reporter Rafael Bracero, was &quot;¿Derrota, qué Derrota?&quot; (&quot;Defeat, what defeat?&quot;). For him, he said, what had occurred was not a defeat, but simply an &quot;electoral loss&quot;. The comment has become legendary in Puerto Rican politics.

===Senator===

In 1986, he was elected by his party to fill a vacancy in the Senate of Puerto Rico, a position for which he did not seek re-election in 1988. Instead, he returned to his private law practice and shortly thereafter merged his law firm with Del Toro &amp; Santana where he practiced until his election to the United States Congress in 1992.

===Resident Commissioner===

In the 1992 elections, Romero was elected to the 103rd and 104th United States Congress as Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, and relocated to Washington, D.C. He was re-elected to the 105th and 106th United States Congress as well.

During his tenure as Resident Commissioner he campaigned for Puerto Rican statehood, successfully proposed to Congress the derogation of the 936 tax code and endorsed the Young Project, which sought to call a referendum to resolve Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status. In 2000, he sought a third term but was defeated by PPD&#x27;s Aníbal Acevedo Vilá. He once again sought his party&#x27;s nomination for the post of Resident Commissioner in 2003, but was defeated by Luis Fortuño. Although he retired from electoral politics, he remained active in PNP political gatherings, the Puerto Rico Democratic Party, the United States Democratic party, and was a member of the League of United Latin American Citizens.

===Shadow United States Senator===

On July 3, 2017, he was appointed by Governor Ricardo Rosselló as Puerto Rico&#x27;s first United States Shadow Senator to the U.S. Senate under the Tennessee Plan approved by Act No. 30 of June 5, 2017 of the Puerto Rico Legislature. Holders of this position do not officially participate in Senate proceedings, but may serve as an advocate for their territories.

==Death==
Romero Barceló was hospitalized in San Juan, Puerto Rico in March 2021 for sepsis and a urinary tract infection. He died a month later on May 2, 2021, at the age of 88.

==Legacy==
Romero Barceló married Kate Donnelly on January 2, 1966. His daughter, Melinda Romero Donnelly, was an NPP member of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico for 8 years, later becoming state senator when she won a special election in 2009 for the vacant seat of former senator Jorge De Castro Font. Romero Barceló was a boxing fan, and advocated for holding world championship bouts in San Juan during his terms in office. Some of his accomplishments were the Minillas Tunnel, the Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferre, the creation of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, and the Roberto Clemente Coliseum (while the Mayor of San Juan).

Federal charges filed against Puerto Rico former governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá stemmed from a tip brought to federal prosecutors by Romero Barceló. Romero openly admitted to being the catalyst of the federal investigation against Acevedo Vilá. In 2000, Acevedo accused Romero Barcelo of receiving $175,000 USD of illegal contributions to fund his own campaign bid for Resident Commissioner. In the end, Acevedo Vilá was acquitted of all charges.

==Accolades==
In 1977, he received a doctorate Honoris causa from the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut.

<doc id="99040" wikidata="Q211781" url="?curid=99040" title="Free jazz">
<text>Free jazz, or free form in the early to mid-1970s, is a style of avant-garde jazz or an experimental approach to jazz improvisation that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when musicians attempted to change or break down jazz conventions, such as regular tempos, tones, and chord changes. Musicians during this period believed that the bebop and modal jazz that had been played before them was too limiting, and became preoccupied with creating something new. The term &quot;free jazz&quot; was drawn from the 1960 Ornette Coleman recording &quot;Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation&quot;. Europeans tend to favor the term &quot;free improvisation&quot;. Others have used &quot;modern jazz&quot;, &quot;creative music&quot;, and &quot;art music&quot;.

The ambiguity of free jazz presents problems of definition. Although it is usually played by small groups or individuals, free jazz big bands have existed. Although musicians and critics claim it is innovative and forward-looking, it draws on early styles of jazz and has been described as an attempt to return to primitive, often religious, roots. Although jazz is an American invention, free jazz musicians drew heavily from world music and ethnic music traditions from around the world. Sometimes they played African or Asian instruments, unusual instruments, or invented their own. They emphasized emotional intensity and sound for its own sake, exploring timbre.

== Characteristics ==
Free jazz was a reaction to the convolution of bop. Conductor and jazz writer Loren Schoenberg wrote that free jazz &quot;gave up on functional harmony altogether, relying instead on a far ranging, stream-of-consciousness approach to melodic variation&quot;. The style was largely inspired by the work of jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman. 

Some jazz musicians resist any attempt at classification. One difficulty is that most jazz has an element of improvisation. Many musicians draw on free jazz concepts and idioms, and free jazz was never entirely distinct from other genres, but free jazz does have some unique characteristics. Pharoah Sanders and John Coltrane used harsh overblowing or other extended techniques to elicit unconventional sounds from their instruments. Like other forms of jazz it places an aesthetic premium on expressing the &quot;voice&quot; or &quot;sound&quot; of the musician, as opposed to the classical tradition in which the performer is seen more as expressing the thoughts of the composer.

Earlier jazz styles typically were built on a framework of song forms, such as twelve-bar blues or the 32-bar AABA popular song form with chord changes. In free jazz, however, the dependence on a fixed and pre-established form is often eliminated, and the role of improvisation is correspondingly increased.

Other forms of jazz use regular meters and pulsed rhythms, usually in 4/4 or (less often) 3/4. Free jazz retains pulsation and sometimes swings but without regular meter. Frequent and ritardando give an impression of rhythm that moves like a wave.

Previous jazz forms used harmonic structures, usually cycles of diatonic chords. When improvisation occurred, it was founded on the notes in the chords. Free jazz almost by definition is free of such structures, but also by definition (it is, after all, &quot;jazz&quot; as much as it is &quot;free&quot;) it retains much of the language of earlier jazz playing. It is therefore very common to hear diatonic, altered dominant and blues phrases in this music.

Guitarist Marc Ribot commented that Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler &quot;although they were freeing up certain strictures of bebop, were in fact each developing new structures of composition.&quot; Some forms use composed melodies as the basis for group performance and improvisation. Free jazz practitioners sometimes use such material. Other compositional structures are employed, some detailed and complex.

The breakdown of form and rhythmic structure has been seen by some critics to coincide with jazz musicians&#x27; exposure to and use of elements from non-Western music, especially African, Arabic, and Indian. The atonality of free jazz is often credited by historians and jazz performers to a return to non-tonal music of the nineteenth century, including field hollers, street cries, and jubilees (part of the &quot;return to the roots&quot; element of free jazz). This suggests that perhaps the movement away from tonality was not a conscious effort to devise a formal atonal system, but rather a reflection of the concepts surrounding free jazz. Jazz became &quot;free&quot; by removing dependence on chord progressions and instead using polytempic and polyrhythmic structures.

Rejection of the bop aesthetic was combined with a fascination with earlier styles of jazz, such as dixieland with its collective improvisation, as well as African music. Interest in ethnic music resulted in the use of instruments from around the world, such as Ed Blackwell&#x27;s West African talking drum, and Leon Thomas&#x27;s interpretation of pygmy yodeling. Ideas and inspiration were found in the music of John Cage, Musica Elettronica Viva, and the Fluxus movement.

Many critics, particularly at the music&#x27;s inception, suspected that abandonment of familiar elements of jazz pointed to a lack of technique on the part of the musicians. By 1974, such views were more marginal, and the music had built a body of critical writing.

Many critics have drawn connections between the term &quot;free jazz&quot; and the American social setting during the late 1950s and 1960s, especially the emerging social tensions of racial integration and the civil rights movement. Many argue those recent phenomena such as the landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision in 1954, the emergence of the Freedom Riders in 1961, the 1963 Freedom Summer of activist-supported black voter registration, and the free alternative black Freedom Schools demonstrate the political implications of the word &quot;free&quot; in context of free jazz. Thus many consider free jazz to be not only a rejection of certain musical credos and ideas, but a musical reaction to the oppression and experience of black Americans.

== History ==
Although free jazz is widely considered to begin in the late 1950s, there are compositions that precede this era that have notable connections to the free jazz aesthetic. Some of the works of Lennie Tristano in the late 1940s, particularly &quot;Intuition&quot;, &quot;Digression&quot;, and &quot;Descent into the Maelstrom&quot; exhibit the use of techniques associated with free jazz, such as atonal collective improvisation and lack of discrete chord changes. Other notable examples of proto-free jazz include &quot;City of Glass&quot; written in 1948 by Bob Graettinger for the Stan Kenton band and Jimmy Giuffre&#x27;s 1953 &quot;Fugue&quot;. It can be argued, however, that these works are more representative of third stream jazz with its references to contemporary classical music techniques such as serialism.

Keith Johnson of AllMusic describes a &quot;Modern Creative&quot; genre, in which &quot;musicians may incorporate free playing into structured modes—or play just about anything.&quot; He includes John Zorn, Henry Kaiser, Eugene Chadbourne, Tim Berne, Bill Frisell, Steve Lacy, Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and Ray Anderson in this genre, which continues &quot;the tradition of the &#x27;50s to &#x27;60s free-jazz mode&quot;.

Ornette Coleman rejected pre-written chord changes, believing that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression. His first notable recordings for Contemporary included &quot;Tomorrow Is the Question!&quot; and &quot;Something Else!!!!&quot; in 1958. These albums do not follow typical 32-bar form and often employ abrupt changes in tempo and mood.

The free jazz movement received its biggest impetus when Coleman moved from the west coast to New York City and was signed to Atlantic. Albums such as &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot; and &quot;Change of the Century&quot; marked a radical step beyond his more conventional early work. On these albums, he strayed from the tonal basis that formed the lines of his earlier albums and began truly examining the possibilities of atonal improvisation. The most important recording to the free jazz movement from Coleman during this era, however, came with &quot;Free Jazz&quot;, recorded in A&amp;R Studios in New York in 1960. It marked an abrupt departure from the highly structured compositions of his past. Recorded with a double quartet separated into left and right channels, &quot;Free Jazz&quot; brought a more aggressive, cacophonous texture to Coleman&#x27;s work, and the record&#x27;s title would provide the name for the nascent free jazz movement.

Pianist Cecil Taylor was also exploring the possibilities of avant-garde free jazz. A classically trained pianist, Taylor&#x27;s main influences included Thelonious Monk and Horace Silver, who prove key to Taylor&#x27;s later unconventional uses of the piano. &quot;Jazz Advance&quot;, his album released in 1956 for Transition showed ties to traditional jazz, albeit with an expanded harmonic vocabulary. But the harmonic freedom of these early releases would lead to his transition into free jazz during the early 1960s. Key to this transformation was the introduction of saxophonist Jimmy Lyons and drummer Sunny Murray in 1962 because they encouraged more progressive musical language, such as tone clusters and abstracted rhythmic figures. 
On &quot;Unit Structures&quot; (Blue Note, 1966) Taylor marked his transition to free jazz, as his compositions were composed almost without notated scores, devoid of conventional jazz meter, and harmonic progression. This direction influenced by drummer Andrew Cyrille, who provided rhythmic dynamism outside the conventions of bebop and swing Taylor also began exploring classical avant-garde, as in his use of prepared pianos developed by composer John Cage.

Albert Ayler was one of the essential composers and performers during the beginning period of free jazz. He began his career as a bebop tenor saxophonist in Scandinavia, and had already begun pushing the boundaries of tonal jazz and blues to their harmonic limits. He soon began collaborating with notable free jazz musicians, including Cecil Taylor in 1962. He pushed the jazz idiom to its absolute limits, and many of his compositions bear little resemblance to jazz of the past. Ayler&#x27;s musical language focused on the possibilities of microtonal improvisation and extended saxophone technique, creating squawks and honks with his instrument to achieve multiphonic effects. Yet amidst Ayler&#x27;s progressive techniques, he shows an attachment for simple, rounded melodies reminiscent of folk music, which he explores via his more avant-garde style.

One of Ayler&#x27;s key free jazz recordings is &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot;, including his often recorded and most famous composition, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, in which a simple spiritual-like melody is gradually shifted and distorted through Ayler&#x27;s unique improvisatory interpretation. Ultimately, Ayler serves as an important example of many ways which free jazz could be interpreted, as he often strays into more tonal areas and melodies while exploring the timbral and textural possibilities within his melodies. In this way, his free jazz is built upon both a progressive attitude towards melody and timbre as well as a desire to examine and recontextualize the music of the past.

In a 1963 interview with &quot;Jazz&quot; Magazine, Coltrane said he felt indebted to Coleman. While Coltrane&#x27;s desire to explore the limits of solo improvisation and the possibilities of innovative form and structure was evident in records like &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, his work owed more to the tradition of modal jazz and post-bop. But with the recording of &quot;Ascension&quot; in 1965, Coltrane demonstrated his appreciation for the new wave of free jazz innovators. On &quot;Ascension&quot; Coltrane augmented his quartet with six horn players, including Archie Shepp and Pharoah Sanders. The composition includes free-form solo improvisation interspersed with sections of collective improvisation reminiscent of Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Free Jazz&quot;. The piece sees Coltrane exploring the timbral possibilities of his instrument, using over-blowing to achieve multiphonic tones. Coltrane continued to explore the avant-garde in his following compositions, including such albums as &quot;Om&quot;, &quot;Kulu Se Mama&quot;, and &quot;Meditations&quot;, as well as collaborating with John Tchicai. 

Much of Sun Ra&#x27;s music could be classified as free jazz, especially his work from the 1960s, although Sun Ra said repeatedly that his music was written and boasted that what he wrote sounded more free than what &quot;the freedom boys&quot; played. &quot;The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra&quot; (1965) was steeped in what could be referred to as a new black mysticism. But Sun Ra&#x27;s penchant for nonconformity aside, he was along with Coleman and Taylor an integral voice to the formation of new jazz styles during the 1960s. As evidenced by his compositions on the 1956 record &quot;Sounds of Joy&quot;, Sun Ra&#x27;s early work employed a typical bop style. But he soon foreshadowed the free jazz movements with compositions like &quot;A Call for All Demons&quot; off of the 1955–57 record &quot;Angels and Demons at Play&quot;, which combines atonal improvisation with Latin-inspired mambo percussion. His period of fully realized free jazz experimentation began in 1965, with the release of &quot;The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra&quot; and &quot;The Magic City.&quot; These records placed a musical emphasis on timbre and texture over meter and harmony, employing a wide variety of electronic instruments and innovative percussion instruments, including the electric celeste, Hammond B-3, bass marimba, harp, and timpani. As result, Sun Ra proved to be one of the first jazz musicians to explore electronic instrumentation, as well as displaying an interest in timbral possibilities through his use of progressive and unconventional instrumentation in his compositions.

The title track of Charles Mingus&#x27; &quot;Pithecanthropus Erectus&quot; contained one improvised section in a style unrelated to the piece&#x27;s melody or chord structure. His contributions were primarily in his efforts to bring back collective improvisation in a music scene that had become dominated by solo improvisation as a result of big bands.

Outside of New York, a number of significant free jazz scenes appeared in the 1960s. They often gave birth to collectives. In Chicago, numerous artists were affiliated with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, founded in 1965. In St. Louis, the multidisciplinary Black Artists Group was active between 1968 and 1972. Pianist Horace Tapscott founded the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra and Union of God&#x27;s Musicians and Artists Ascension in Los Angeles. Although they did not organize as formally, a notable number of free jazz musicians were also active in Albert Ayler&#x27;s hometown of Cleveland. They included Charles Tyler, Norman Howard, and the Black Unity Trio.

By the 1970s, the setting for avant-garde jazz was shifting to New York City. Arrivals included Arthur Blythe, James Newton, and Mark Dresser, beginning the period of New York loft jazz. As the name may imply, musicians during this time would perform in private homes and other unconventional spaces. The status of free jazz became more complex, as many musicians sought to bring in different genres into their works. Free jazz no longer necessarily indicated the rejection of tonal melody, overarching harmonic structure, or metrical divide, as laid out by Coleman, Coltrane, and Taylor. Instead, the free jazz that developed in the 1960s became one of many influences, including pop music and world music.

Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill have suggested,
the freer aspects of jazz, at least, have reduced the freedom acquired in the sixties. Most successful recording artists today construct their works in this way: beginning with a strain with which listeners can relate, following with an entirely free portion, and then returning to the recognizable strain. The pattern may occur several times in a long selection, giving listeners pivotal points to cling to. At this time, listeners accept this – they can recognize the selection while also appreciating the freedom of the player in other portions. Players, meanwhile, are tending toward retaining a key center for the seemingly free parts. It is as if the musician has learned that entire freedom is not an answer to expression, that the player needs boundaries, bases, from which to explore.
Tanner, Gerow and Megill name Miles Davis, Cecil Taylor, John Klemmer, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Pharoah Sanders, McCoy Tyner, Alice Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, Anthony Braxton, Don Cherry, and Sun Ra as musicians who have employed this approach.

Canadian artist Stan Douglas uses free jazz as a direct response to complex attitudes towards African-American music. Exhibited at documenta 9 in 1992, his video installation &quot;Hors-champs&quot; (meaning &quot;off-screen&quot;) addresses the political context of free jazz in the 1960s, as an extension of black consciousness and is one of his few works to directly address race. Four American musicians, George E. Lewis (trombone), Douglas Ewart (saxophone), Kent Carter (bass) and Oliver Johnson (drums) who lived in France during the free jazz period in the 1960s, improvise Albert Ayler&#x27;s 1965 composition &quot;Spirits Rejoice.&quot;

&quot;New York Eye and Ear Control&quot; is Canadian artist Michael Snow&#x27;s 1964 film with a soundtrack of group improvisations recorded by an augmented version of Albert Ayler&#x27;s group and released as the album &quot;New York Eye and Ear Control&quot;. Critics have compared the album with the key free jazz recordings: Ornette Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation&quot; and John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Ascension&quot;. John Litweiler regards it favourably in comparison because of its &quot;free motion of tempo (often slow, usually fast); of ensemble density (players enter and depart at will); of linear movement&quot;. Ekkehard Jost places it in the same company and comments on &quot;extraordinarily intensive give-and-take by the musicians&quot; and &quot;a breadth of variation and differentiation on all musical levels&quot;.

French artist Jean-Max Albert, as trumpet player of Henri Texier&#x27;s first quintet, participated in the 1960s in one of the first expressions of free jazz in France. As a painter, he then experimented plastic transpositions of Ornette Coleman&#x27;s approach. &quot;Free jazz&quot;, painted in 1973, used architectural structures in correspondence to the classical chords of standard harmonies confronted with an unrestrained all over painted improvisation.
Jean-Max Albert still explores the free jazz lessons, collaborating with pianist François Tusques in experimental films : Birth of Free Jazz, Don Cherry... these topics considered through a pleasant and poetic way.

Founded in 1967, the Quatuor de Jazz Libre du Québec was Canada&#x27;s most notable early free jazz outfit. Outside of North America, free jazz scenes have become established in Europe and Japan. Alongside the aforementioned Joe Harriott, saxophonists Peter Brötzmann, Evan Parker, trombonist Conny Bauer, guitarist Derek Bailey, pianists François Tusques, Fred Van Hove, Misha Mengelberg, drummer Han Bennink, saxophonist and bass clarinetist Willem Breuker were among the most well-known early European free jazz performers. European free jazz can generally be seen as approaching free improvisation, with an ever more distant relationship to jazz tradition. Specifically Brötzmann has had a significant impact on the free jazz players of the United States.

Japan&#x27;s first free jazz musicians included drummer Masahiko Togashi, guitarist Masayuki Takayanagi, pianists Yosuke Yamashita and Masahiko Satoh, saxophonist Kaoru Abe, bassist Motoharu Yoshizawa, and trumpeter Itaru Oki. A relatively active free jazz scene behind the iron curtain produced musicians like Janusz Muniak, Tomasz Stańko, Zbigniew Seifert, Vyacheslav Ganelin and Vladimir Tarasov. Some international jazz musicians have come to North America and become immersed in free jazz, most notably Ivo Perelman from Brazil and Gato Barbieri of Argentina (this influence is more evident in Barbieri&#x27;s early work).

South African artists, including early Dollar Brand, Zim Ngqawana, Chris McGregor, Louis Moholo, and Dudu Pukwana experimented with a form of free jazz (and often big-band free jazz) that fused experimental improvisation with African rhythms and melodies. American musicians like Don Cherry, John Coltrane, Milford Graves, and Pharoah Sanders integrated elements of the music of Africa, India, and the Middle East for world-influenced free jazz.

<text>Mare Imbrium (Latin &quot;imbrium&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Showers&quot; or &quot;Sea of Rains&quot;) is a vast lava plain within the Imbrium Basin on the Moon and is one of the larger craters in the Solar System. The Imbrium Basin formed from the collision of a proto-planet during the Late Heavy Bombardment. Basaltic lava later flooded the giant crater to form the flat volcanic plain seen today. The basin&#x27;s age has been estimated using uranium–lead dating methods to approximately 3.9 billion years ago, and the diameter of the impactor has been estimated to be 250 ± 25 km. The Moon&#x27;s maria (plural of mare) have fewer features than other areas of the Moon because molten lava pooled in the craters and formed a relatively smooth surface. Mare Imbrium is not as flat as it would have originally been when it first formed as a result of later events that have altered its surface.

== Origin ==
Mare Imbrium formed when a proto-planet from the asteroid belt collided with the Moon during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The impact is dated to approximately 3922 ± 12 million years ago, based on radiometric dating techniques. Ejecta from the impact covers large areas of the near side of the Moon.

== Characteristics ==
With a diameter of 1145 km, Mare Imbrium is second only to Oceanus Procellarum in size among the maria, and it is the largest mare associated with an impact basin.

The Imbrium Basin is surrounded by three concentric rings of mountains, uplifted by the colossal impact event that excavated it. The outermost ring of mountains has a diameter of 1300 km and is divided into several different ranges; the Montes Carpatus to the south, the Montes Apenninus to the southeast, and the Montes Caucasus to the east. At their highest, the outer ring of mountains rise more than 5 km above the surface of Mare Imbrium. The ring mountains are not as well developed to the north and west, and it appears they were simply not raised as high in these regions by the Imbrium impact. The middle ring of mountains forms the Montes Alpes and Montes Archimedes.
The innermost ring, with a diameter of 650 km, is defined by Montes Recti, Montes Teneriffe, and possibly Montes Spitzbergen. Much of this ring is submerged under the mare&#x27;s basalt, resulting in only isolated peaks remaining in some areas, such as Mons Pico and Mons La Hire.
Numerous estimates of the depth of the mare material have been made using various methods. These include analyses of gravity, seismic, and radar data; studies of craters partially filled with basalt and those that have completely penetrated the mare; and comparisons of lunar basins filled with mare deposits to unfilled basins. These studies have yielded depth estimates ranging from 2 km
to 5 km in the central part of the mare. It is thought that the original crater left by the Imbrium impact was as much as 100 km deep, but that the floor of the basin bounced back upwards immediately afterwards.
Surrounding the Imbrium Basin is a region blanketed by ejecta from the impact, extending roughly 800 km outward. Also encircling the basin is a pattern of radial grooves called the &quot;Imbrium Sculpture&quot;, which have been interpreted as furrows cut in the Moon&#x27;s surface by large projectiles blasted out of the basin at low angles, causing them to skim across the lunar surface ploughing out these features. The sculpture pattern was first identified by Grove Karl Gilbert in 1893. Furthermore, a Moon-wide pattern of faults which run both radial to and concentric to the Imbrium basin were thought to have been formed by the Imbrium impact; the event literally shattered the Moon&#x27;s entire lithosphere. At the region of the Moon&#x27;s surface exactly opposite Imbrium Basin, there is a region of chaotic terrain (the crater Van de Graaff) which is thought to have been formed when the seismic waves of the impact were focused there after travelling through the Moon&#x27;s interior. Mare Imbrium is about wide.

A mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Imbrium from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The Imbrium mascon is the largest on the Moon. It was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL.

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Imbrium was named by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.

The earliest known name for the mare may be &quot;The Shrine of Hecate&quot;; Plutarch records that the Ancient Greeks gave this name to the largest of the &quot;hollows and deeps&quot; on the Moon, believing it to be the place where the souls of the deceased were tormented. Ewen A. Whitaker argues that this likely refers to Mare Imbrium, &quot;the largest regular-shaped dark area unbroken by bright patches&quot; that can be seen with the naked eye.

Around 1600, William Gilbert made a map of the Moon that names Mare Imbrium &quot;Regio Magna Orientalis&quot; (the Large Eastern Region). Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map named it &quot;Mare Austriacum&quot; (the Austrian Sea).

==Observation and exploration==
Mare Imbrium is visible to the naked eye from Earth. In the traditional &#x27;Man in the Moon&#x27; image seen on the Moon in Western folklore, Mare Imbrium forms the man&#x27;s right eye.

=== Luna 17 ===
On 17 November 1970 at 03:47 Universal Time, the Soviet spacecraft Luna 17 made a soft landing in the mare, at latitude 38.28 N, and longitude 35.00 W. Luna 17 carried Lunokhod 1, the first robotic rover to be deployed on the Moon or any extraterrestrial body. Lunokhod 1, a remote-controlled rover, was successfully deployed and undertook a mission lasting several months.

=== Apollo 15 ===
In 1971, the crewed Apollo 15 mission landed in the southeastern region of Mare Imbrium, between Hadley Rille and the Apennine Mountains. Commander David Scott and Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin spent three days on the surface of the Moon, including 18½ hours outside the spacecraft on lunar extra-vehicular activity. Command Module Pilot Alfred Worden remained in orbit and acquired hundreds of high-resolution photographs of Mare Imbrium (and other regions of the Moon) as well as other types of scientific data. The crew on the surface explored the area using the first lunar rover and returned to Earth with of lunar surface material. Samples were collected from Mons Hadley Delta, believed to be a fault block of pre-Imbrian (Nectarian or Pre-Nectarian) lunar crust, including the &quot;Genesis Rock.&quot; This was also the only Apollo mission to visit a lunar rille, and to observe outcrops of lunar bedrock visible in the rille wall.

=== 2013 Impact ===
On 17 March 2013, an object hit the lunar surface in Mare Imbrium and exploded in a flash of apparent magnitude 4. The resulting crater was 18 meters wide. This was the brightest impact recorded since NASA&#x27;s lunar impact team began monitoring in 2005.

===Chinese landing===
Chang&#x27;e 3 landed on 14 December 2013 on Mare Imbrium, about 40 km south of the 6 km diameter &quot;Laplace F&quot; crater, at 44.1260°N 19.5014°W.
The lander deployed the Yutu rover 7 hours and 24 minutes later. Chang&#x27;e 3 mission attempted to perform the first direct measurement of the structure and depth of the lunar soil down to a depth of , and investigate the lunar crust structure down to several hundred meters deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuanet.com/politics/2012-06/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The rover&#x27;s ground penetrating radar found evidence of at least nine distinct rock layers, indicating that the area had surprisingly complex geological processes and is compositionally distinct from the Apollo and Luna landing sites.

<doc id="99047" wikidata="Q2645447" url="?curid=99047" title="Calumet, Michigan">
<text>Calumet ( or ) is a village in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The village is located within Calumet Township, Houghton County, and had a population of 621 at the 2020 census.

Calumet was once the center of Michigan&#x27;s copper mining industry. The village is home to a unit of Keweenaw National Historical Park, and also includes the Calumet Downtown Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Most of the village itself is also included within the Calumet Historic District, a larger area which is NRHP-listed and which is a National Historic Landmark District.

== History ==

What is now Calumet was settled in 1864, originally under the name of Red Jacket, for a Native American Chief of the Seneca tribe. Until 1895 the name &quot;Calumet&quot; was used by the nearby town of Laurium, Michigan; present-day Calumet was not legally named so until 1929.

Red Jacket grew due to the copper mines in the area. It was incorporated as a town in 1867. The copper mines were particularly rich; the Boston-based Calumet and Hecla Mining Company produced more than half of the United States&#x27; copper from 1871 through 1880. In addition to copper mining and smelting, the region also supported the dairy industry and truck farming. Many immigrants (from Poland and other countries) settled there in the late 19th century.
By 1900, Red Jacket had a population of 4,668, and Calumet Township, which contained Red Jacket and nearby mining towns, had a population of 25,991. However, in 1913, Red Jacket suffered from the Copper Country Strike of 1913–1914, and the population began to decline. In the same year, the town was the site of the Italian Hall Disaster. Striking miners and their families were gathered on Christmas Eve for a party in Italian Hall, when the cry of &quot;fire&quot; precipitated a stampede that crushed or suffocated seventy-three victims, over half of them children under ten years old. The identity of the person(s) who started the stampede has never been determined. Folk singer Woody Guthrie&#x27;s 1945 song, &quot;1913 Massacre&quot;, is based on this event.

Loss of wartime demand caused the copper price to drop following World War I. With the decreased demand for copper, thousands left Red Jacket in the 1920s, many moving to Detroit, Michigan, where the automobile industry was booming.

During the Great Depression, almost all mines were shut down. As a result, many miners and their families left to find work. In 1950, the population of Calumet was 1,256 people. Small-time mining continued in the area, particularly during World War II, until it was shut down completely by a labor strike in 1968.

In 1984, Calumet&#x27;s name was borrowed by Hollywood. Calumet was moved from Michigan to Colorado, where it was invaded by Soviet paratroopers in the original &quot;Red Dawn&quot; film. Producer and screenwriter Kevin Reynolds was a seasonal resident of the Keweenaw Peninsula.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

Calumet is at an elevation of above sea level. The village of Calumet sits on of underground mine shafts, drifts and stopes, empty for many decades. Large portions of the Keweenaw National Historical Park are located inside the village limits, mostly covering the intricate complex of the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company&#x27;s main operations.

==Transportation==

=== Major highways ===

* passes just outside village limits, and serves as a primarily southwest–northeast route on Copper Island. The highway can be used to access Hancock and Houghton about to the southwest, and further on to cities like Marquette and Escanaba. Immediately southeast of Calumet is an intersection with M-26, which can be used to access Laurium and Lake Linden.
* passes immediately north of the village. The route is a primarily recreational route, providing access to McLain State Park and the Keweenaw Waterway between Calumet and Hancock.

===Airport===
Houghton County Memorial Airport (KCMX), largely in nearby Oneco, serves Calumet, Houghton County and the surrounding communities.

=== Train ===
Calumet was host to a number of railroad routes, including:

* The Copper Range Railroad traveled through Calumet and continued northeast to the stamp mills at Gay.
* The Hecla &amp; Torch Lake Railroad, which carried ore from the mines in the village off to the stamp mills in Lake Linden.
* The Mineral Range Railroad also operated here.

==People and culture==

===Food===
One of the biggest parts of the food culture of not only Calumet, but the entire Copper Country, is the pasty. This was a main part of copper miners&#x27; diets. A pasty is a mixture of meat, potatoes, rutabaga, carrots and onions wrapped in a crust made of flour and lard. Traditionally Cornish, they have even sparked local events such as the Pasty Fest, where there are eating contests (with consumption of pasties, of course), games, events, and even a tug of war event where the losers take a dive into an inflatable pool filled with ketchup.

===Theatre===
The Calumet Theatre is a theater and opera house which opened in 1900. In 1898, the copper mining industry was booming, and the town had an enormous surplus in its treasury. The town council decided to spend some of the surplus on a theater. The theater hosted a large number of famous actors, musicians, and opera singers. With the closing of the mines, the theater became a movie theater and fell into general disrepair for many years. In 1975, the town began a large project to repair and restore the theater, which is now used for many local and touring productions. The theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 1971, and is also a Michigan State Historic Site. The Theatre was the original recording venue of the &quot;Red Jacket Jamboree&quot;, an old-time radio variety show heard on Michigan public radio stations including Interlochen Public Radio and WNMU Public Radio 90.

===Summer activities===
Every two years there is an all-school reunion for the graduates of Calumet High School. Many activities occur at this time, including a classic car show and parade.

Pasty Fest is a one-day event that takes place every summer downtown Calumet. The event celebrates the pasty, which was brought over by Cornish miners in the mid 1800s. The meat and vegetable &quot;pie&quot; became a staple for miners throughout the Upper Peninsula. The event includes a parade, street fair, live music, a pasty eating contest and a competition among restaurants for the best pasty.

== Public education ==
Public education in Calumet is served by Public Schools of Calumet-Laurium-Keweenaw. High school education is served by Calumet High School, whose teams are known as the &quot;Copper Kings&quot;.

==Churches==

===St. Paul the Apostle Church===
St. Paul the Apostle Church, formerly known as St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church, was formed in 1889 by Slovenian immigrants who came to the Calumet area to work in the booming copper mines. The first church that they built burnt down in 1902, but the church was rebuilt in sandstone by 1908. The church &quot;rises authoritatively over the village like a cathedral of medieval Europe.&quot; When the church was completed, the cost of construction was an amazing $100,000. It is constructed of local Jacobsville sandstone, and features beautiful stained glass windows, a custom-built 19’ by 18’ pipe organ, and a beautifully painted interior. The interior of the church remains virtually unchanged architecturally. In 1966, four of the five Catholic churches in the Calumet area were forced to merge because of the low number of parishioners and economic constraints. This included St. Anne&#x27;s (the French church), St. John&#x27;s (the Croatian church), St. Mary&#x27;s (the Italian church), and St. Joseph&#x27;s. The combined parish is housed in the old St. Joseph&#x27;s building, and has changed its name to St. Paul the Apostle Church. Today, they have a large and active congregation, which pays for the upkeep of the church.
===Protestant churches===
The city, at one time, Calumet had six active Lutheran churches (two of which were Laestadian), three Methodist churches, as well as an Episcopal, Congregationalist, Baptist and Presbyterian church.

Today, only one Lutheran, Baptist, Methodist, and Episcopal church remain open. Additionally, another Baptist church has opened. Two of the former Lutheran churches and the Presbyterian church are still standing today but are not in use.
