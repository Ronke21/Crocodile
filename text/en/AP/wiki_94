<text>Nelson Lagoon (Unangax̂: &quot;Niilsanam Alĝuudaa&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Aleutians East Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census the population was 41, down from 52 in 2010 and 83 in 2000.

Nelson Lagoon was established around 1960 and is the youngest of the Borough communities. It is the only Aleut settlement on the Bering Sea shore. The community is on the northern coast of the Alaska Peninsula and sits on a narrow sand spit that separates the lagoon from the Bering Sea. Nelson Lagoon is in the middle of a rich and productive salmon fisheries area. The community&#x27;s dock, boat ramp, harbormaster&#x27;s office and warehouse were completed in the late 1990s. Nelson Lagoon has excellent docking facilities as well as boat and gear storage. A state-owned 4,000-foot-long lighted gravel runway allows regularly scheduled flights.

In March 2016, Nelson Lagoon was coated with tephra, during a strong eruption of nearby Mount Pavlof.

== History ==
The location where Nelson Lagoon sits was used as an Aleut summer campsite during the fishing season. In 1882, the lagoon was named for Edward William Nelson, a naturalist and explorer who travelled the region between 1877 and 1920. From 1906 until 1917, a salmon salting facility operated at the location, which was staffed mainly by Scandinavian fishermen. These men married local women, and today most native people in Nelson Bay have partial Scandinavian ancestry.

A permanent settlement was established in 1960. A school was built five years later, and the settlement grew into a larger permanent community.

In 1985, an environmental impact statement by the Minerals Management Service of the United States Department of the Interior was released, producing an in-depth analysis of the Nelson Bay community and its cultural, demographic, religious, political and educational atmosphere as well as predictions. The statement wrote about a well-organized, tight-knit community. The study reported the five-member Nelson Bay village council was formed in 1971, still consisted of all its original members, met often, and was competent and unified in its representation of the community. Unlike other villages, in Nelson Bay, politics were a familial affair; village councils represented the three main families in the village.

The environmental impact statement wrote that culturally and economically, the village was much as it was at the time of its founding: small, relatively undeveloped and very isolated. The village&#x27;s younger generations were reported to have developed the unique tendency of brothers of one family marrying sisters of another family, thus requiring future generations to find spouses in other communities.

The Russian Orthodox Church was the village&#x27;s dominant religion at the time, but secularization was taking place. Education was highly valued in the Nelson Bay, and the 1985 environmental impact statement wrote this could have been a legacy of the village&#x27;s Scandinavian ancestors.

<text>Sand Point, also known as Popof Island, is a city in Aleutians East Borough, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 976, up from 952 in 2000, but by the 2020 Census this had reduced to 578. It is on northwestern Popof Island, one of the Shumagin Islands, off the Alaska Peninsula. It is the borough seat of Aleutians East Borough, and is near the entrance to the Bering Sea.

The Aleutians East Borough School District is in Southwestern Alaska along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Chain The District was formed in 1988 from smaller districts that consolidated and formed a Borough with taxing authority. The Borough and District boundaries are the same, and stretch over approximately of roadless, mostly treeless tundra, from the middle of the Alaska Peninsula to the north and east, going southwest out to Akutan just east of Dutch Harbor.

==History==

Sand Point was founded by a San Francisco fishing company in 1898 as a cod fishing station and trading post. Aleuts and Scandinavians were among the early residents. Gold mining was briefly a part of the economy during the early 1900s. Fishing remains an important industry, as Sand Point is home to one of the largest fishing fleets in the Aleutian Chain.

==Description==
Almost half the inhabitants are of Aleut descent - mainly from the Qagan Tayagungin tribe, and support themselves by fishing and fish processing. There is a cold storage and fish-processing plant owned and operated by Trident Seafoods and Peter Pan has a support facility. There is an airport with a paved runway and daily flights (weather permitting) to Anchorage, to the northeast.

The town is above the treeline, and there is a small herd of 120 bison (first introduced in the 1930s) which provides some meat for the island&#x27;s inhabitants. It is notorious for the high winds caused by the meeting of cold air flows from the Bering Sea with the warm air over the Japan Current.

<text>Adak (; , ), formerly Adak Station, is a city located on Adak Island, in the Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 171, down from 326 in 2010. It is the westernmost municipality in the United States and the southernmost city in Alaska. (See Extreme points of the United States.) The city is the former location of the Naval Air Facility Adak, NAVFAC Adak.

==History==
===19th century===
The Aleutian Islands were historically occupied by the Unanga, more commonly known now as the Aleuts. The once heavily populated island was eventually abandoned in the early 19th century as the Aleutian Island hunters followed the Russian fur trade eastward, and famine set in on the Andreanof Island group. However, they continued to hunt and fish actively around the island over the years, until World War II broke out.

=== Military===
Adak Army installations allowed U.S. and Canadian forces to mount a successful offensive against the Japanese-held islands of Kiska and Attu. After the war, Adak was developed as a naval air station, playing an important role during the Cold War as a submarine surveillance center. Large earthquakes rocked the island in 1957, 1964 and 1977.

At its peak, the station housed over 6,000 naval and Coast Guard personnel and their families. In 1994, the base was downsized, the local McDonald&#x27;s and both the family housing and schools were closed. The station officially closed on March 31, 1997, as a result of 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC). The Aleut Corporation purchased Adak&#x27;s facilities under a land transfer agreement with the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Navy/Department of Defense. This agreement was finalized in March 2004. About 30 families with children relocated to Adak in September 1998, most of them Aleut Corp. shareholders, and the former high school was reopened at that time as a K–12 institution. The community incorporated as a second-class city in April 2001. Substantially all of the infrastructure and facilities on Adak are owned by Aleut Corporation, which is currently developing Adak as a commercial center via their subsidiary companies. For example, properties in active use are leased by Adak Commercial Properties, LLC.

Since World War II, the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard developed facilities and recreation opportunities at Adak. At its peak, Adak had a college, a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, a Baskin-Robbins ice cream stand, movie theater, roller skating rink, swimming pool, ski lodge, bowling alleys, skeet range, auto hobby shop, photo lab, and racquetball &amp; tennis courts. A new $18-million hospital was built in 1990, just seven years prior to the closure of the station. By March 2003, six years after the closure of the station, most of these facilities had closed.

As of March 2021, the U.S. Navy is considering reopening the air base at Adak.

==Geography==
Adak is located on Kuluk Bay, on Adak Island, in the Andreanof Islands group of the Aleutian Islands Recording District, and in the 3rd Judicial District. It lies southwest of Anchorage and west of Dutch Harbor at 51.872° North, 176.636° West (Sec. 10, T096S, R195W, Seward Meridian), near the Russian end of the arc that makes up this volcanic island chain. Flight time to Anchorage is 3 hours or longer, depending on weather. Adak is the southernmost community in Alaska and on the same latitude as Haida Gwaii in Canada, and London, England. It is less than three degrees of latitude north of the 49th parallel, which forms the western part of the land border between the Contiguous United States and Canada.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (3.87%) is water.

===Climate===
Adak has a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc), characterized by persistently overcast skies, moderate temperatures, high winds, significant precipitation, and frequent cyclonic storms. Winter squalls produce wind gusts in excess of . During the summer, extensive fog forms over the Bering Sea and North Pacific. Average temperatures range from , but wind chill factors can be severe. Average annual precipitation is annually, concentrated markedly in fall and winter. December is the wettest single month on average, while June and July are markedly the driest months, with thunderstorms virtually unknown here. Snowfall averages nearly per winter season, which however tends to melt soon after falling. With 263 rainy days per year, Adak has the second highest number of any inhabited locality in the United States after Hilo, Hawaii.

==Demographics==
Adak first appeared on the 2000 U.S. Census as a census-designated place (CDP), although it previously was the Adak Naval Station from 1970 to 1990. In 2001, it formally incorporated as a city. As of the 2010 census, Adak was the only city in Alaska to have a majority Asian population (171 of 326 residents). Akutan and Kodiak have Asian pluralities.

===2020 census===
===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 316 people, 159 households, and 61 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 884 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 49.68% White, 1.27% Black or African American, 35.13% Native American, 9.81% Asian, 1.90% Pacific Islander, and 2.22% from two or more races. Of the population, 5.06% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 159 households, 18.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.9% were married couples living together, 2.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 61.6% were non-families. Of all households, 46.5% were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.99 and the average family size was 2.90.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 18.7% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 44.3% from 25 to 44, 26.3% from 45 to 64, and 1.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 184.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 188.8 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $52,727, and the median income for a family was $53,889. Males had a median income of $46,429 versus $35,000 for females. The per capita income for the city was $31,747. About 3.3% of families and 4.7% of the population were below the poverty line, none of whom were under the age of eighteen or over the age of sixty-five.

==Economy==

A land exchange between Aleut Corp., the U.S. Navy, and the Department of the Interior transferred most of the former naval facilities to the Aleut Corp. in March 2004. A portion of the island remains within the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The U.S. Navy retains part of the north end of Adak Island (Parcel 4) and does annual sweeps of the Andrew Lake Seawall for unexploded ordnance. Their website lists the Institutional Controls in place for all of Adak as part of the land exchange or Interim Conveyance. The Navy provides the trail maps as part of the ordnance awareness information required to be shown to all Adak residents and visitors. Adak currently provides a fueling port and crew transfer facility for a combination of Seattle and Alaskan based fishing fleet — an airport, docks, housing facilities, restaurant, grocery, and ship supply store are available.

Golden Harvest Alaska Seafood processes Pacific cod, pollock, mackerel, halibut, snow and king crabs at a 144,000-square-foot seafood processing facility on the island. Four local residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for groundfish; however, commercial fishing vessels based out of Seattle and other parts of Alaska provide most of the work for the seafood plant by regularly offloading their catch at the facility&#x27;s large dock. The local airport allows the company to send orders via air cargo from Adak to markets around the world, including entire planes full of live king crab to China.

==Government==
===Elections===
Because Adak is in HST (once Daylight Saving Time ends), the furthest-west time zone in all areas of the United States that vote in US presidential elections, combined with the fact that polls in Alaska close at 8:00 PM while polls in Hawaii close at 7:00 PM, Adak ends up being the place where the last person votes in a US presidential election—when the polls close in Adak, the time is 1:00 AM Eastern Standard Time.

==Infrastructure==

===Water===
Water is derived from Lake Bonnie Rose, Lake De Marie, and Nurses Creek, stored in seven water tanks throughout the community, and piped to facilities and housing units. The wastewater treatment system discharges through a marine outfall line to Kuluk Bay. Adak&#x27;s water system is reported to have lead in it.

===Waste===
Waste was previously removed by a permitted landfill site; This site was operated on Adak Island under Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (Alaska DEC) solid waste regulations. The landfill operated from the early 1950s until 1972 and from 1975 until 2002. The site was used to dispose of sanitary trash, metal debris, batteries, solvents, waste paints, and construction rubble. From 1975 on, the landfill only accepted sanitary trash.

The landfill was closed in 1997 by placing a low permeability soil cover over the landfill, implementing access restrictions, installing surface erosion controls, and placing a vegetative cover. In March 2002, the State of Alaska approved resumption of operations at Roberts Landfill through 2002 to dispose of inert demolition waste monofill and one cell for disposal of approximately 10 cubic yards of asbestos-containing material. Alaska DEC approved closure of the landfill in 2002.

===Identified contaminants===
Metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and surface water.

===Current actions===
The Navy inspects institutional controls (ICs) annually. The Navy conducts groundwater monitoring at four wells and surface water monitoring at five locations annually.

===Electricity===
Electricity is provided by TDX which has invested over one million dollars in improving generating and distribution systems. The price of electricity has been reported to have been reduced due to a greater reliance on wind power.

===Schools===
There was one school located in the community: Adak School, operated by the Aleutian Region School District. In 2014, the Adak School had 25 students. It was previously served by the Adak Region School District, which closed in June 1996. The Adak School closed in 2023, reportedly due to low enrollment.

===Internet access===
Internet, though available, is typically expensive, with caps on data. Average use can be extremely expensive, and a monopoly existed as personal satellite internet has not been available due to the satellite locations. Solar activity blocks communications during equinox seasons for several days of both spring and fall seasons.

Due to its remoteness the internet connection has historically been very poor, and applications that require high bandwidth could not work as intended. However, since late 2022 and 2023, Starlink has provided further internet access to many residents across rural Alaska, including to those in Adak.

===Health care===
There is no hospital; however there is Adak Community Health Center, managed by Eastern Aleutian Tribes, Inc. (EAT).

The health center provides Family Medicine, Chronic Care and urgent care services, and is staffed by a physician-assistant or, at times, by a community health practitioner. There is no doctor, no blood supply, and limited medications to stabilize a patient awaiting a medical evacuation, weather permitting. Behavioral Health is also provided via tele-video and quarterly site visits. EAT sends a dentist to Adak one week per year to provide limited dental services; otherwise, dental services must be referred outside of Adak. Tele-Radiology (X-ray) and Tele-Medicine are also present. Limited lab, pharmacy, and public health services are also available. The pharmacy medications are limited to acute medications. Filling of prescriptions from outside facilities usually cannot be accommodated. All visitors should bring plenty of their own medications as the health center stocks a very limited supply of chronic medications. Auxiliary emergency health care is provided by Adak Volunteer Fire Department.

===Facilities===
Other facilities in Adak include three deep water docks and fueling facilities. The city has requested funds to greatly expand the Sweeper Cove small boat harbor, including new breakwaters, a dock and new moorage floats . There are approximately of paved and primitive roads on Adak, all privately owned by the Aleut Corporation.

The Aleut are also seeking to develop their water system, which has been well-maintained and -designed for a larger Naval population, as an export industry.

===Airport===

Because of its naval aviation past, Adak has an unusually large and sophisticated airport for the Aleutian Islands. The airport is currently operated by the State of Alaska Department of Transportation. Complete with an Instrument Landing System, Adak Airport has no control tower and two wide asphalt paved runways at elevation. One runway measures long while the other runway measures . Alaska Airlines operates twice-weekly Boeing 737 passenger jet service from Anchorage. At present, flights operate each Wednesday and Saturday, weather permitting. Occasionally, extra seasonal flights are operated to meet the demand of the fishing season.

<text>Attu is a census-designated place (CDP) located on Attu Island in the Aleutians West Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 21 at the 2010 census, consisting entirely of coast guard personnel who resided and worked at Casco Cove Coast Guard Station, but left the island when the station was closed in August 2010, leaving it uninhabited. LORAN Station Attu had provided a navigational signal for mariners of the North Pacific since the 1970s.

Although it is relatively the westernmost point in the United States, Attu Station is technically one of the easternmost points, located at , opposite the 180th meridian from the rest of the United States.

==History==

After the Japanese invasion of Attu Island and the battle to retake it, the United States government constructed a LORAN station on the southern tip of the island, at Theodore Point. The equipment to build the station came from Holtz Bay and was ferried on barges and landing craft to Baxter Cove, about east of the station. Bulldozers were used to cut a road from Baxter Cove to Theodore Point.

In 1960, the station was moved to Casco Cove, near the former United States Navy base at Massacre Bay. Later, it was moved to Massacre Bay. LORAN Station Attu ceased transmission of the LORAN signal on February 8, 2010, and the Russian-American signal ceased on August 1, 2010.

In 2025, the U.S. Naval Institute proposed reviving the military airfield on Attu.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , for which of it is land and of it (0.75%) is water.

==Demographics==

Attu (Naval) Station first appeared on the 1980 U.S. Census as &quot;Attu&quot;, a census-designated place (CDP). It did not return on the 1990 census. The name was changed to Attu Naval Station and redesignated a CDP in 2000. It appeared on the 2010 census with a population of 21 just before the closure of the station in August that year and the departure of its remaining residents.

===2020 census===
At the 2000 census there were 20 people, 0 households, and 0 families in the CDP. The population density was . There were 0 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 18 White, 1 from other races, and 1 from two or more races. Five of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The age distribution was 7 from 18 to 24, 12 from 25 to 44, and 1 from 45 to 64. The median age was 30 years. There were 19 men and one woman.

Males had a median income of $26,250, which is the same as for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $26,964. None of the population was below the poverty line.

As noted above, however, due to the closure of the station the community is presently uninhabited.

<text>Nikolski (&quot;Chalukax̂&quot; in Aleut; ) is a census-designated place (CDP) on Umnak Island in Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska, United States. The population was 39 at the 2020 census, up from 18 in 2010. Nikolski is on Nikolski Bay, off the southwest end of the island. It is 116 air miles west of Unalaska, and 900 air miles from Anchorage. Residents are known as Unangan, and Aleut is spoken in most of the remaining homes.

==History==
The Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association reports that Nikolski is thought to be one of the oldest continuously occupied communities in the world. Archaeological evidence from Ananiuliak Island, 5 km offshore in Nikolski Bay, dates human habitation to 8,500 years ago. A site known as Chaluka in Nikolski shows 4,000 years of virtually continuous occupation. Subsistence activities, sheep and cattle raising, and fishing are the main livelihoods and the latter has been traced back thousands of years by archaeologists, through analysis of midden sites and fish hook designs in the 1960s. Previous activities from the 1800s included sea otter hunting and fox farming. A sheep ranch was established in 1926 as part of the Aleutian Livestock Company and there are thousands on the island today. In the early 1900s the residents purchased a large fishing boat with money made from those activities, the “Umnak Native”, but it was wrecked in 1933.

In June 1942 during World War II, the Japanese attacked Unalaska to the East and had also seized Attu and Kiska islands, to the west. Residents of Umnak Island were evacuated to the Ketchikan area in far southeastern Alaska, although an American airstrip and military base on the north of the island, Fort Glenn Army Air Base (abandoned by 1950) repelled Japanese forces. The Battle of Attu and associated campaigns in 1943 recaptured the lost islands to the west. Nikolski locals returned in 1944, but some had experienced the outside world for the first time and since then, many natives have remained offshore, working in canneries or on fishing vessels. The US Air Force built a White Alice radar communication site on the edge of town in the 1950s, but it was abandoned by 1977. A 3,500-foot gravel runway, the unattended Nikolski Air Station remains, and there are passenger, mail and cargo services depending on the harsh weather conditions. Nikolski has no harbour.

==Geography==
Nikolski is located at .

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (0.55%) is water. The island is in the maritime climate zone. Temperatures range from 11 degrees F (−11 C) to 65 degrees (18 C). Snowfall is considerable and covers Mount Vsevidof and other peaks, with rain and strong winds much of the year, and summer fog.

On a clear day the view from Nikolski is dominated by Mount Vsevidof to the northeast, the highest point on Umnak Island (). Vsevidof is tectonically active, and an eruption last occurred on March 11, 1957, following an earthquake. A cataclysmic eruption of Mount Okmok in the northernmost part of the island severely affected Nikolski residents in July 2008.

The boundary between the Alaska Time Zone (UTC−9) and Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone (UTC−10) passes just west of Nikolski, along the line of 169°30&#x27;W through Samalga Pass. This places Nikolski in the Alaska Time Zone.
However, as Nikolski is part of the Aleutian Region School District the settlement effectively observes Hawaii–Aleutian time.

==Demographics==
Nikolski first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated Aleut village of &quot;Nikolsky.&quot; It had 127 residents, of whom 117 were Aleut, 8 were Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Native) and 2 were White. In 1890, it returned as &quot;Umnak&quot;, with 94 residents, of whom 80 were native and 14 were Creole. It did not appear again until 1920, when it again reported as &quot;Umnak.&quot; Beginning with the 1930 census and to date, it has reported as Nikolski. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980.

As of the census of 2000, there were 39 people, 15 households, and 12 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 28 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 30.77% White and 69.23% Native American.

Of the 15 households, 40.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.3% were married couples living together, 20.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.0% were non-families. 20.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 2.92.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 35.9% under the age of 18, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 10.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 105.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $38,750, and the median income for a family was $40,250. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $11,875 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $14,083. There were 23.5% of families and 20.7% of the population living below the poverty line, including 13.6% of under eighteens and 55.6% of those over 64.

==Education==

Nikolski is served by the Aleutian Region Schools.

The Nikolski School served grades K-12. The school had one live-in teacher that occupied a small home owned by the school district adjacent to the school building and purpose-built for teachers and their family. The school was constructed in 1939 by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Circa 1978, the school had a single teacher, and 15 students. In 2008, the number of students fell below 9. Beginning in 1998, schools in rural Alaska had to have at least 10 students, in order to retain funding from the state, and campuses not meeting the number had to close. The school district used its budget to keep the school open. An American Samoan family arrived, but as the school lost more students, that family did not have enough children to enroll to make up the required 10 students and, subsequently, the family moved away. A student living elsewhere was offered to relocate to Nikolski, where he would be the 10th student, but he chose not to, partly because the Nikolski School could not offer welding classes, and thus the school could not reach the 10 student threshold. The school closed down after the conclusion of the 2009–2010 school year. The permanent teacher left during the fall semester, so a volunteer had to fill in for the rest of the school year. After it closed down, some of the students left the village, while others were home schooled.

==Media==
An episode of angler and TV presenter Jeremy Wade&#x27;s Dark Waters (2019) was partially filmed in Nikolski. He failed to catch elusive large halibut offshore, and was stranded due to bad weather for several days.

==Education==

St. George is served by the Pribilof Island School District. In 2004, the district began offering 9–12th grade to St. George students via video conference. Students have a choice: they can live at home and attend distance education classes or they can leave home and attend a boarding school like Mt. Edgecumbe High School.

In 2017, St. George School was closed entirely due to low enrollment. The district now offers a correspondence program for grades K-10.

== Geography and wildlife ==
The island is notable as being the breeding site of over 75% of the known population of red-legged kittiwakes.

In 2016, a new species of beaked whale, &quot;Berardius beringiae&quot;, was discovered near the island.

St. George Island is considered part of the Bering Sea Volcanic Province.

<text>St. Paul ( or , ) is a city in the Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska, United States. It is the main settlement of Saint Paul Island in the Pribilofs, a small island group in the Bering Sea. The population was 413 at the 2020 census, down from 479 in 2010. Saint Paul Island is known as a birdwatching haven.

The three closest islands to Saint Paul Island are Otter Island to the southwest, Saint George slightly to the south, and Walrus Island to the east.

St. Paul Island&#x27;s land area is . St. Paul Island in 2008 had one school (K-12, 76 students), one post office, one bar, one small store, and one church (the Russian Orthodox Sts. Peter and Paul Church), which is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

The island was one of the last places where woolly mammoths survived, until around 5,600 years ago.

==Geography and geology==
St. Paul is located at (57.133806, −170.266614).

Saint Paul is the largest of the Pribilof Islands and lies the farthest north. With a width of at its widest point and a length of on its longest axis (which runs from northeast to southwest), it has a total area of . Volcanic in origin, Saint Paul features a number of cinder cones and volcanic craters in its interior. The highest of these, Rush Hill, rises to on the island&#x27;s western shore, though most of the upland areas average less than in elevation. Most of the island is a low-lying mix of rocky plateaus and valleys, with some of the valleys holding freshwater ponds. Much of its of shoreline is rugged and rocky, rising to sheer cliffs at several headlands, though long sandy beaches backed by shifting sand dunes flank a number of shallow bays.

Like the other Pribilof Islands, Saint Paul rises from a basaltic base. Its hills are primarily brown or red tufa and cinder heaps, though some (like Polavina) are composed of red scoria and breccia. The island sits on the southern edge of the Bering-Chukchi platform, and may have been part of the Bering Land Bridge&#x27;s southern coastline when the last ice age&#x27;s glaciers reached their maximum expansion. Sediment core samples taken on Saint Paul show that tundra vegetation similar to that found on the island today has been present for at least 9,000 years. The thick rough turf is dominated by umbellifers (particularly &quot;Angelica&quot;) and &quot;Artemisia&quot;, though grasses and sedges are also abundant.
== History and culture ==
The Aleut people knew of the Pribilofs long before westerners discovered the islands. They called the islands &quot;Amiq&quot;, Aleut for &quot;land of mother&#x27;s brother&quot; or &quot;related land&quot;. According to their oral tradition, the son of an Unimak Island elder found them after paddling north in his boat in an attempt to survive a storm that caught him out at sea; when the winds finally died, he was lost in dense fog—until he heard the sounds of Saint Paul&#x27;s vast seal colonies.

The Pribilofs, named after the Russian navigator Gavriil Pribylov, were discovered in 1786 by Russian fur traders; no Alaska Natives are known to have lived on the island prior to this point. They landed first on St. George on St. Peter and St. Paul&#x27;s Day, July 12, 1788, and named the larger island to the north St. Peter and St. Paul Island. Three years later the Russian merchant vessel &quot;John the Baptist&quot; was shipwrecked off the shore. The crew were listed as missing until 1793, when the survivors were rescued by Gerasim Izmailov.

In the 18th century, the Russian-American Company forced Aleuts from the Aleutian chain (several hundred miles south of the Pribilofs) to hunt seal for them on the Pribilof Islands. Before this the Pribilofs were not regularly inhabited. The Aleuts were essentially slave labor for the Russians—hunting, cleaning, and preparing fur seal skins, which the Russians sold for a great deal of money. The Aleuts were not taken back to their home islands; they lived in inhumane conditions, they were beaten, and they were regulated by the Russians down to what they could eat and wear and whom they could marry. Their descendants live on the two islands today.

In 1870, the now-American owned Alaska Commercial Company (formerly the Russian-American Company) was awarded a 20-year sealing lease by the U.S. Government, and provided housing, food and medical care to the Aleuts in exchange for seal harvesting. In 1890, a second 20-year lease was awarded to the North American Commercial Company, however, the fur seals had been severely over-harvested and only an estimated 200,000 fur seals remained. The 1910 Fur Seal Treaty ended private sealing on the islands and placed the community and fur seals under the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. Food and clothing were scarce, social and racial segregation were practiced, and working conditions were poor.

Saints Peter and Paul Church, a Russian Orthodox church, was built on the island in 1907.

During World War II, as the Imperial Japanese Army threatened the Aleutians; the 881 Aleuts on the Pribilof islands were forcibly removed, with no more than several hours&#x27; notice, to internment in abandoned salmon canneries and mines in Southeast Alaska until May 1944. The Aleut men were brought back to the islands temporarily in the summer of 1943 to conduct the fur seal harvest for the federal government, seal oil being used in the war effort. Most Aleuts from the Pribilofs were imprisoned at Funter Bay on Admiralty Island in Southeast Alaska. In 1979, the Aleut people from the Pribilof islands received $8.5 million in partial compensation for the unfair and unjust treatment they were subject to under federal administration between 1870 and 1946. In 1983, Congress passed the Fur Seal Act Amendments, which ended government control of the commercial seal harvest and most of the federal presence on the island. Responsibility for providing community services and management of the fur seals was left to local entities. USD$20 million was provided to help develop and diversify the Island economy—USD$12 million to St. Paul and USD$8 million to St. George. Commercial harvesting on St. Paul ceased in 1985. Ownership of fur seal pelts is now prohibited except for subsistence purposes.

== Demographics ==

Saint Paul Island has the largest Aleut community in the United States, one of the U.S. government&#x27;s officially recognized Native American &quot;tribal entities&quot; of Alaska. Out of a total population of 480 people, 457 of them (86 percent) are Alaska Natives.

Saint Paul first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated Aleut village. Of its 298 residents, 284 were Aleut and 14 were white. In 1890, it reported with 244 residents. A plurality of 111 were creole (mixed Russian &amp; Native), 108 were Native, 22 were white and 3 were Asian. It did not report in 1900, but from 1910 to 1940, it reported as &quot;Saint Paul Island.&quot; From 1950-onward, it has reported as Saint Paul. It formally incorporated in 1971.

As of the census of 2000, there were 532 people, 177 households, and 123 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 214 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 85.90% Native American, 12.97% white, 0.56% Pacific Islander, and 0.56% from two or more races.

There were 177 households, out of which 38.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.1% were married couples living together, 22.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.5% were non-families. 24.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.88 and the average family size was 3.44.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 29.5% under the age of 18, 9.6% from 18 to 24, 32.5% from 25 to 44, 22.9% from 45 to 64, and 5.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 123.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 125.9 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $50,750, and the median income for a family was $51,750. Males had a median income of $32,583 versus $29,792 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,408. About 6.4% of families and 11.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.9% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Nature and wildlife==

Saint Paul Island, like all of the Pribilof Islands, is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Its seabird cliffs were purchased in 1982 for inclusion in the refuge. The island has also been designated as an Important Bird Area.

It is the breeding grounds for more than 500,000 northern fur seals and millions of seabirds, and is surrounded by one of the world&#x27;s richest fishing grounds.

Woolly mammoths survived on Saint Paul Island until around 5,600 years ago (~3,600 BC), which is the most recent survival of North American mammoth populations. It is thought that this population died out as a result of diminishing fresh water, brought on by climate change making the island more arid, and exacerbated by the erosion of the few freshwater lakes present on the island that the mammoths used for drinking water as a result of mammoth activity.

A mass die-off of puffins at St. Paul Island between October 2016 and January 2017 has been attributed to ecosystem changes resulting from climate change. Climate change has also made it warm enough for rats to survive St. Paul&#x27;s cold winters, and so the island&#x27;s harbor is equipped with a number of traps to catch any rats carried in aboard ships.

===Birds===
No fewer than 319 species of birds have been recorded on the island. In spring (May through mid-June) and fall (August through October), many rare birds, including Siberian vagrants, may be spotted on the island. The cliffs of Saint Paul, Saint George and Otter Island support large numbers of breeding seabirds, including critical nesting habitat for the very range-restricted red-legged kittiwake. The auk family is well represented here, with horned and tufted puffin, thick-billed and common murre, parakeet, crested and least auklets and ancient murrelet occurring as breeders, and several other species occurring as vagrants or seasonal visitors. Breeding ducks include long-tailed duck, northern pintail, and green-winged teal. Breeding shorebirds include semipalmated plover, the Pribilof subspecies of rock sandpiper, least sandpiper and red-necked phalarope. Breeding landbirds are few, but include insular subspecies of gray-crowned rosy finch and Pacific wren, snow bunting, Lapland longspur, and the occasional hoary or common redpoll, or common raven. Saint Paul Island Tours (part of the TDX Corp.) runs a natural history tourist program to the island of Saint Paul from May through early October, offering interested visitors the chance to explore the avifauna of the island.

===Northern fur seals===

One of the most notable sights on the island are the northern fur seal rookeries. The Pribilof Islands support about half of the global population, with some of the individual rookeries on Saint Paul Island containing over 100,000 seals. In late May, the male seals begin to arrive and stake out their territories in preparation for the arrival of the females, who typically arrive during the third week of June. The females give birth soon after making landfall, and by mid-July there will be hundreds of young pups around the island. On June 1, the rookeries are closed and remain off limits until mid-October. During the summer these marine mammals may be viewed, by permit, from blinds at two rookeries.

===Harbor seals, sea lions, walrus, whales===
Harbor seals breed on Otter Island, several miles southwest of St. Paul Island, but nonetheless are often seen off St. Paul shores. Occasionally, Steller sea lions haul out on St. Paul, but usually take refuge in the rookery at Walrus Island, some northeast of St. Paul. On extremely rare occasions, grey whales, orcas, and walrus are observed offshore.

===Blue fox===
The Blue fox is a subspecies of the Arctic fox. Endemic to the island, the fox can be found roaming the hills and climbing the cliffs as it scavenges for food. Though clearly able to capture the occasional gull, foxes near the town prefer to scavenge garbage and explore the fishing docks and Processing Plant. Kits hide under storage containers and gobble a fisherman&#x27;s offered scraps. Some kits shed their dark color much faster than their siblings and adopt a fluffy white/grey coat by mid-September. Foxes inhabiting areas farther from the human dwellings boast a more aggressive and territorial manner. Edging the fur seal rookeries, the two species cohabit easily.

===Reindeer===
A large herd of reindeer roam the island. Of domesticated Russian stock, 25 reindeer were introduced to the island in the fall of 1911, but, after a peak of 2,046 organisms in 1938, the number decreased to 8.

===Wildflowers===
In spring, with the greening of the island, wildflowers begin to decorate the maritime tundra landscape. There are more than 100 species of wildflowers, from the Arctic lupine, with its bluish-purple blossoms, to the glowing yellow Alaska poppy, that can be viewed.

==Climate==

The climate of St. Paul is Arctic maritime. The Bering Sea location results in cool weather year-round and a narrow range of mean temperatures varying from 19 to 51 degrees Fahrenheit. Average precipitation is , with snowfall of . Heavy fog is common during summer months. Lightning and thunder are virtually unheard of. The last time a thunderstorm occurred in St. Paul was on November 8, 1982, which was the first thunderstorm in 40 years.

Saint Paul&#x27;s climate is strongly influenced by the cold waters of the surrounding Bering Sea, and is classified as polar (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;) due to the raw chilliness of the summers. It experiences a relatively narrow range of temperatures, high wind, humidity and cloudiness levels, and persistent summer fog. There is high seasonal lag: February is the island&#x27;s coldest month, while August is its warmest; the difference between the average low temperature in February and the average high temperature in August is only . Although the mean average temperature for the year is above freezing, at , the monthly daily average temperature remains below freezing from December to April. Low temperatures at or below occur an average of 4.7 nights per year (mostly from January to March), and the island is part of USDA Hardiness Zone 6. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on January 27, 1919, up to on August 14, 2020, and August 25, 1987. Winds are strong and persistent year-round, averaging around . They are strongest from late autumn through winter, when they increase to an average of nearly , blowing mostly from the north. In the summer, they become weaker and blow primarily from the south.

The island&#x27;s humidity level, which averages more than 80 percent year round, is highest during the summer. Cloud cover levels peak during the summer as well. Although high year-round, with an average of 88 percent, cloud cover levels rise to 95 percent in the summer. Fog too is more common in the summer, occurring on roughly one-third of the days. The island receives about of precipitation per year, with the highest monthly totals occurring between late summer and early winter, when Bering Sea storms batter the island. Snowfall levels are highest between December and March, averaging per year. Other than trace amounts, the period from June to September is generally snow-free. High winds and relatively warm temperatures combine to keep snow levels low, resulting in monthly mean snow depths of less than . Hours of daylight range from a low of 6.5 hours in midwinter to a high of 18 hours in midsummer.
==Facilities and utilities==

Water is supplied by wells and an aquifer and is treated. There are two new wooden tanks; one 500,000 gallon and one 300,000 gallon. All 167 homes and facilities are connected to the piped water and sewer system and are fully plumbed. An ocean outfall line was recently added for seafood processing waste. The city collects refuse. The Tribe operates a recycling program which is currently on hold. A landfill, incinerator, sludge and oil disposal site have recently been completed. A new $3million power plant came online in 2000. A small wind turbine provides power and hot water to the village office, but it is not connected to the power grid. Electricity is provided by St. Paul Municipal Electric Utility.

TDX Power&#x27;s first energy-generation facility was built on St. Paul Island. Completed in 1999, the wind energy-based electric and thermal cogeneration facility was widely regarded as one of the more technologically advanced wind-energy power projects in America. The TDX Power wind/diesel hybrid facility is known for its efficiency and reduction in diesel fuel consumption. The -tall turbine is a major point of pride for the ecologically conscious Aleut community of Saint Paul. Two additional units were installed in 2007. Each unit is rated at 225 kW and the blade lengths are 44.3 ft (13.5 m).

==Health care==
Local hospitals or health clinics include St. Paul Health Clinic. The clinic is a qualified Emergency Care Center. St. Paul is classified as an isolated town/Sub-Regional Center. It is found in EMS Region 2H in the Aleutian/Pribilof Region. Currently the City of St. Paul&#x27;s Department of Public Safety provides no emergency medical services to residents or visitors on island. Two advanced life support ambulances sit idle at the community clinic due to a lack of staffing and funding provided for by the city.

==Education==
St. Paul is served by the Pribilof Island School District, headquartered in the city. St. Paul School is attended by 73 students and covers grades K–12.

==Economy and transportation==

Some of the island&#x27;s residents stay only part of the year and work in the crab and boat yards. The large boats that have been fishing the Bering Sea offload their fish onto the island and workers prepare them for shipping around the world.

The federally controlled fur seal industry dominated the economy of the Pribilofs until 1985. St. Paul is a port for the Central Bering Sea fishing fleet, and major harbor improvements have fueled economic growth. Trident Seafoods and Icicle Seafoods process cod, crab, halibut and other seafoods in St. Paul. 30 residents hold commercial fishing permits for halibut. Several offshore processors are serviced out of St. Paul. The community is seeking funds to develop a halibut processing facility. Fur seal rookeries and more than 210 species of nesting seabirds attract almost 700 tourists annually. There is also a reindeer herd on the island from a previous commercial venture. Residents subsist on halibut, fur seals (1,645 may be taken each year), reindeer, marine invertebrates, plants and berries.

St. Paul is accessible by sea and air. Most supplies and freight arrive by ship. There is a breakwater, of dock space, and a barge off-loading area. A small boat harbor is under construction through 2005 by the Corps of Engineers.

The island has an airport, known as St. Paul Island Airport. RAVN Alaska provides regularly scheduled flights to Anchorage using de Havilland DHC-8-100 turboprop aircraft. There is one asphalt north–south oriented runway that is in length. Runway 36 has an ILS approach system, allowing for instrument approaches during times of fog and low ceilings.

==Media==
St. Paul is served by KUHB-FM 91.9, an NPR affiliate that broadcasts a wide variety of programming and music. St. Paul also has two low-power translators of the statewide Alaska Rural Communications Service on Channel 4 (K04HM) and Channel 9 (K09RB-D).

Novastoshnah, the northeastern presque-isle of the island, and Lukannon, on the island&#x27;s south peninsula (see survey map above) are settings of the Rudyard Kipling story &quot;The White Seal&quot; and poem &quot;Lukannon&quot; in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. Walrus Island, visible on the same map off to the east, is also mentioned in the same story.

<text>The City of Unalaska (; ) is the main population center in the Aleutian Islands. The city is in the Aleutians West Census Area, a regional component of the Unorganized Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. Unalaska is located on Unalaska Island and neighboring Amaknak Island in the Aleutian Islands off mainland Alaska. The population was 4,254 at the 2020 census, which is 81% of the entire Aleutians West Census Area. Unalaska is the second largest city in the Unorganized Borough, behind Bethel.

The Aleut (Unangan) people have lived on Unalaska Island for thousands of years. The Unangan, who were the first to inhabit the island of Unalaska, named it &quot;Ounalashka&quot;, meaning &quot;near the peninsula&quot;. The regional native corporation has adopted this moniker, and is known as the Ounalashka Corporation. The Russian fur trade reached Unalaska when Stepan Glotov and his crew arrived on August 1, 1759. Natives, Russians and their Alaskan Creole descendants comprised most of the community&#x27;s population until the mid-20th century, when the involvement of the United States in World War II led to a large-scale influx of people and construction of buildings all along the strategically located Aleutians.

Almost all of the community&#x27;s port facilities are on Amaknak Island, better known as Dutch Harbor or just &quot;Dutch&quot;. It is the largest fisheries port in the U.S. by volume caught. It includes Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears, U.S. Army, a U.S. National Historic Landmark. Dutch Harbor lies within the city limits of Unalaska and is connected to Unalaska by a bridge. Amaknak Island is home to almost 59 percent of the city&#x27;s population, although it has less than 3 percent of its land area.

As a result of the town&#x27;s strong fishing industry, Unalaska has also become notable for its large population of bald eagles, which number in the hundreds and were attracted to the area by human activity.

==History==

The island of Unalaska was first inhabited by the Aleut people.

Unalaska and Amaknak Islands contained 24 settlements with more than 1,000 Aleut inhabitants in 1759, when the first Russian group under Stepan Glotov came and started trading for three years on Umnak and Unalaska. Between 1763 and 1766, a conflict between the Russian fur traders and the Unalaska Natives occurred; the Aleuts destroyed four Russian ships and killed 175 hunters/traders. In the 1760s, Unalaska was temporarily used as a Russian fur trading post. The post was permanently established in 1774, and was eventually incorporated into the Russian-American Company. It was there that Captain James Cook encountered the navigator Gerasim Izmailov in 1778.

In 1788, the Spanish made contact with the Russians in Alaska for the first time. An expedition by Esteban José Martínez and Gonzalo López de Haro visited several Russian settlements. Their westernmost visit was to Unalaska. On August 5, 1788, they claimed Unalaska for Spain, calling it &quot;Puerto de Dona Marie Luisa Teresa&quot;.

Alexander Andreyevich Baranov was shipwrecked here in 1790.
In 1825, the Russian Orthodox Church of the Holy Ascension was built in Unalaska. The founding priest, Ivan Veniaminov, later canonized as Saint Innocent of Alaska, composed the first Aleut writing system with local assistance, and translated scripture into Aleut. Between 1836 and 1840, measles, chicken-pox and whooping-cough epidemics drastically reduced the population; thus, at the end of the decade, only 200 to 400 Aleuts lived in Unalaska.

On October 18, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska, which made Unalaska part of the U.S. territory.

In 1880, the Methodist Church opened a school and a clinic for orphans in Unalaska. Between 1899 and 1905, the Gold Rush brought many ships through Dutch Harbor, where the North American Commercial Company had a coaling station.
During the first half of the century, the island was touched by numerous epidemics, first in 1900, and then in 1919 the Spanish flu touched the island: these contributed to a dramatic decrease of the population in Unalaska.

Fearing the threat from Imperial Japan during World War II, the neutral United States began fortifying Dutch Harbor in 1940, resulting in the construction of the Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears. Construction finished entirely by September 1941, three months before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor that caused the U.S. to enter the war. On June 3, 1942, the town was attacked by Japanese air forces in the Battle of Dutch Harbor, part of the Aleutian Islands Campaign. After the attack and the Japanese occupations of Kiska and Attu, almost all of the native residents of Amaknak Island were evacuated. Many were held under poor conditions in camps in Southeast Alaska for the duration of the war; a substantial number of the internees died during the imprisonment.

Beginning in the 1950s, Unalaska became a center of the Alaskan king crab fishing industry; by 1978 it was the largest fishing port in the United States. A 1982 crash in king crab harvests decimated the industry, and the mid-1980s saw a transition to bottom fishing.

On October 25, 1977, an extremely intense extratropical system struck the area. A pressure of 926 millibars was recorded at Dutch Harbor, which was the lowest non-tropical pressure ever recorded in the United States until December 31, 2020, when another system struck the islands with a pressure of 924.8 millibars. Winds in excess of 100 knots caused the shipwreck of MV Kuroshima in 1997.

===Recent history===

The city has struggled with problems like alcoholism and unemployment in the past and still does, although the situation has improved in recent years. One example is the Elbow Room, a bar which locally, and later abroad, became infamous for its raucousness. It was closed in 2005.

Since 2005, the Discovery Channel&#x27;s documentary show &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; has focused on fishermen who are based in Dutch Harbor.

In 2023 Starlink&#x27;s first community gateway, a small ground station, was built in Unalaska.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (47.71%) is water.

Makushin Volcano () is located on the island; it is not quite visible from within the town of Unalaska, though the steam rising from its cone is visible on the rare clear day. By climbing one of the smaller hills in the area, such as Pyramid Peak or Mount Newhall, it is possible to get a good look at the snow-covered cone.

===Paleontology===
A major find was announced in 2015 after scientists examined a group of giant, tusked, quadruped, marine mammal fossils. The species had been unearthed during excavation for the construction of a school. They are unique, shore dwellers belonging to the extinct order Desmostylia, and possibly related to Proboscidea or Sirenia. A rendition of a group was drawn by Alaskan artist Ray Troll.

===Climate===
As in all of the Aleutian islands in the south of Akutan Island (32 °F or 0 °C isotherm) the climate of Unalaska is a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;), closely bordering a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) following the trend of warming have predominates the first one. Even so, other climatic maps present even in group D in the Köppen Classification (even though all months average above freezing), with moderate and fairly uniform temperatures and heavy precipitation. Winters are consistently cold, but relatively mild in comparison to other parts of the state. Summers are cool, with most afternoons only reaching highs of to . Fog is often present even when it is not raining. Summer weather is around cooler than Southeast Alaska (Sitka), but the winter temperatures are nearly the same, although despite the higher latitudes of cities such as Sitka and Ketchikan, both of the two cities have warmer winters than Unalaska.

The mean annual temperature for Unalaska is about , being about in January and about in August. The coldest month has been February 1984 with a mean temperature of , while the warmest month was August 2019 at ; the annual mean temperature has ranged from in 1916 to in 2016. With about 225 rainy days a year, Unalaska is among the rainiest places in the United States. June through August are markedly the driest months of the year, with very rare thunderstorms. Precipitation is especially heavy from October to February, when frequent, often-intense storms from the North Pacific Ocean cross the area, bringing high to very high winds and heavy precipitation in any form, and sometimes, changing forms (rain, freezing rain, sleet, snow). On average, December is the year&#x27;s wettest month. Snowfall averages over per winter season, and can be heavy from December to March.

Unalaska&#x27;s recorded temperature range is from in August 1982 to in January 1986. The coldest daytime maximum recorded is and the annual mean coldest day is . The warmest night on record is well above the average daily summer high temperature, standing at , with the mean for the annual warmest night being .


===Note===
==Demographics==

Unalaska first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as the Aleut and Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Aleut) village of Iliuliuk. Of its 406 residents, 230 were Aleut, 162 were Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Native) and 14 were White. It was the 9th largest community in Alaska. In 1890, it returned as Unalaska with 317 residents. This included a majority of 165 Creoles, 84 Natives, 66 Whites and 2 Asians (the total population included adjacent Dutch Harbor, and 5 docked vessels including the steamers &quot;Arago&quot; and &quot;Dora&quot; and schooners &quot;Nellie Martin&quot;, &quot;Pearl&quot; and &quot;Matthew Turner&quot;). In 1900, it reported as Unalaska again, but did not present a racial breakdown. It reported again as Iliuliuk in 1910, but has reported from 1920 onwards as Unalaska. It was formally incorporated in 1942.

===2020 census===
===2010 census===
In the census of 2010, there were 4,376 people, 927 households, and 533 families residing in the city. There were 1106 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 39% White, 7% Black or African American, 6% Native American, 33% Asian (28% Filipino, 3% Vietnamese, 1% Japanese, 1% Other Asian), 2% Pacific Islander, 7% from other races, and 6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 15% of the population.

There were 927 households, out of which 34% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43% were married couples living together, 8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43% were non-families. 35% of all households had individuals under 18 and 5% had someone living who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.5 and the average family size was 3.2.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 15% under the age of 20, 6% from 20 to 24, 40% from 25 to 44, 36% from 45 to 64, and 3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.7 years. For every 100 females, there were 194.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 218.7 males.

==Economy==

The port of Unalaska / Dutch Harbor is the main port and field base for the storied Bering Sea king crab fishery. The Dutch Harbor crabbing fleet is featured in the television show &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;, a documentary style show on the Discovery Channel, and Dutch Harbor&#x27;s facilities and local pub are featured prominently in numerous episodes.

Dutch Harbor has also been the largest fisheries port in the United States, in terms of volume of seafood caught, for nearly every year since 1981. Until 2000, it also ranked first in terms of the dollar value of its catch; since 2000, however, the port of New Bedford, Massachusetts, has outranked Dutch Harbor in that category.

A pilot project in Unalaska / Dutch Harbor, Alaska, is producing fish oil biodiesel from the local fish processing industry in conjunction with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It is rarely economical to ship the fish oil elsewhere and Alaskan communities are heavily dependent on diesel power generation. The local factories process 3.5 million gallons of fish oil annually.

Unalaska has a council–manager form of government. The mayor is elected at large, and serves a three-year term; their powers are mostly ceremonial.

The city council is the legislative body of the city; it is made up of six members, who are elected at large by a direct vote of the city&#x27;s electorate. They also serve three-year terms. The city council has for its mission to &quot;enact the laws of the city, set the mill rate for property taxes within the city, approve the annual budget for the city, and appropriate funds to provide for city services&quot;.

The incumbent mayor is Vincent M. Tutiakoff Sr. Former mayor Frank Kelty served more terms than any other Unalaska mayor, with a total of six terms over the years.

Unalaska also maintains its own municipal police department.

===Legislative representation===
Unalaska is located in the Aleutians No. 2 voting precinct, in the 37th election district and Senate district S. The city is represented in the Alaska House of Representatives by Bryce Edgmon, an Independent from Dillingham, and in the Alaska Senate by Lyman Hoffman, a Democrat from Bethel.

Unalaska was home to Carl Moses, who moved there from King Cove in the mid-1960s and was a business and political leader in the community for decades until shortly before his death in 2014. Moses was the longest-serving member in the history of the Alaska House, serving a total of 22 years, from 1965 to 1973 and from 1993 to 2007. He also served under three different political parties, first as a Republican, later switching to Democrat, and also served the majority of one term as a member of the Alaskan Independence Party. The only other Unalaska resident to serve in the legislature was Eric G. Sutcliffe, at the time owner of Stormy&#x27;s Restaurant. Sutcliffe served a single term in the House, from 1981 to 1983.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===
As Unalaska is designated a first-class city and located within the Unorganized Borough, it is required under state law to operate its own schools rather than participate in a Rural Education Attendance Area. The Unalaska City School District reported an enrollment of 418 students for the 2018–2019 school year, split roughly evenly between Eagle&#x27;s View Elementary School (pre-elementary through 4th grade) and Unalaska Jr/Sr High School (5th through 12th grades).

UCSD was voted one of the best 100 school districts in the United States by &quot;Offspring Magazine&quot;, a &quot;Forbes&quot; publication. It has also consistently been one of the highest scoring schools in Alaska in both the Standards-based exams and Alaska Exit Exam. In 2006, the Alaska Association of School Boards awarded the school district with the Outstanding School Board Award and Superintendent of the Year award.

Unalaska Headstart also serves the community&#x27;s pre-elementary education needs.

Previously the Aleutian Region School District, which serves rural areas in the western Aleutian Islands, had its administrative headquarters in Unalaska; the school board&#x27;s mailing address was in Unalaska.

===Tertiary education===
The University of Alaska Fairbanks also has a campus in Unalaska, the University of Alaska, Aleutian Pribilof campus. This college is part of the College of Rural Alaska network and offers both conventional classroom and distance classes. It offers university classes, community workshops, local courses, as well as dual credit for high school students.

11% of Unalaska residents age 25 and older have a bachelor&#x27;s or advanced college degree.

==Transportation==
Unalaska is connected to the rest of the state by air via the Unalaska Airport, a paved runway owned by the state of Alaska, from which daily flights are scheduled. These flights consist of turboprop service to and from Anchorage. A seaplane base is also available. In 2002, the state of Alaska changed the name of the airport to &quot;Tom Madsen Airport&quot;, after a bush pilot killed in an accident that year, although the FAA still uses the airport&#x27;s original name.

The Alaska Marine Highway operates once every two weeks from Kodiak between April and October. Out of the ten major docks in Unalaska, three are operated by the city. A World War II sub dock was refurbished and now offers ship repair services.

There are approximately of paved road, and of road total in Unalaska. According to traffic counts taken by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, the most heavily traveled roads in Unalaska are Airport Beach Road between 5th Street and East Point Road, 5th Street between Broadway Avenue and Airport Beach Road, and Broadway Avenue between 5th Street and Steward Road. These roads recorded an annual average daily traffic volume of approximately 3,000 cars.

Akiachak is located on the west bank of the Kuskokwim River in the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, northeast of Bethel. The area averages of precipitation, with snowfall of . Summer temperatures range from . Winter temperatures range from .

==History and culture==
The Yup&#x27;ik peoples used this region as a seasonal subsistence site. Called &quot;Akiakchagamiut&quot; in the 1890 census, the village had a population of 43 then. A post office was established in 1934. It incorporated as a second-class city on February 7, 1974. The city government was dissolved in 1987, in favor of traditional village council governance.

A federally recognized Alaska Native tribal entity, the Akiachak Native Community, is located here. Akiachak is a Yup&#x27;ik Eskimo village with a fishing and subsistence lifestyle. It has a strong traditional community, and was the first city in Alaska to dissolve its city government in favor of the Native village government. The sale, importation and possession of alcohol are banned in the village.

==Demographics==


Akiachak first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as the unincorporated native village of &quot;Akiakchagmiut.&quot; All 43 of its residents were Native. It returned as Akiachak in 1900. It did not appear again on the census until 1940, when it returned as &quot;Akiachok.&quot; It returned in 1950 and every successive census as Akiachak. It formally incorporated in 1974. In 1990, it disincorporated and was assigned the status of census-designated place (CDP).

As of the census of 2000, there were 585 people, 133 households, and 111 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 150 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 3.42% White, 92.31% Native American, and 4.27% from two or more races. 1.20% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 133 households, out of which 63.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.4% were married couples living together, 15.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 15.8% were non-families. 14.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.40 and the average family size was 4.89.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 44.4% under the age of 18, 9.6% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 14.5% from 45 to 64, and 5.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 121.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 118.1 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $35,833, and the median income for a family was $35,288. Males had a median income of $31,667 versus $18,750 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $8,321. About 16.2% of families and 21.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 25.7% of those under age 18 and 34.8% of those age 65 or over.

Currently half of the village is hooked up to a plumbing system. The village is currently working to write a grant in order to receive federal funding to plumb the rest of the village who still use honey buckets and must get their water from the river, rain, or snow. The village would like to purchase an incinerator and use the waste heat for public buildings. Electricity is provided by Akiachak Native Community Electric Co. There is one school located in the community, attended by over 200 students each year and growing. Local hospitals or health clinics include Akiachak Health Clinic. Akiachak Health Clinic is a Primary Health facility - they do not have authorization to prescribe drugs, give birth control, or handle much more than colds, small cuts, or routine strep throat treatment which is pervasive in the community. Most live births, birth control, injury, or serious illness will be referred to the Bethel hospital or patients may be air lifted to Anchorage in serious cases. Akiachak is classified as an isolated village. It is found in EMS Region 7A in the Yukon/Kuskokwim Region. Emergency Services have river and air access. Emergency service is provided by a health aide.

==Economy and transportation==

The majority of year-round employment in Akiachak is in education and other public services. The Yupiit School District, which serves both Akiachak and nearby Tuluksak, has its headquarters located in the community. As part of the district&#x27;s curriculum, students can take part in substance harvesting and moose hunts, in order to learn the traditions of the Yupiit communities.

Residents rely on seasonal employment such as commercial fishing, construction and BLM fire-fighting. 70 residents hold commercial fishing permits, and some work at canneries in Bristol Bay. The community is developing a fish processing facility and freezer. Subsistence activities provide most food sources. Poor fish returns since 1997 have significantly affected the community.

Akiachak Airport, a state-owned long by wide gravel airstrip and public seaplane facilities, provides scheduled and chartered services year-round to Akiachak. Relocation of the Akiachak Airport is planned for the future. Boats, snowmachines and ATVs are used extensively by locals on the Kuskokwim River. A winter trail exists to Bethel (19 mi). Barges deliver bulk fuel and supplies during the summer.

<text>Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.
Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% are due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity or excessive alcohol consumption. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation, and environmental pollutants. Infection with specific viruses, bacteria and parasites is an environmental factor causing approximately 16–18% of cancers worldwide. These infectious agents include &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not directly cause cancer but it causes immune deficiency that can magnify the risk due to other infections, sometimes up to several thousandfold (in the case of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma). Importantly, vaccination against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus have been shown to nearly eliminate risk of cancers caused by these viruses in persons successfully vaccinated prior to infection.

These environmental factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.
The risk of developing certain cancers can be reduced by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, limiting consumption of processed meat and red meat, and limiting exposure to direct sunlight. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening for breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. More personalized therapies that harness a patient&#x27;s immune system are emerging in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at diagnosis, the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%. For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66% for all ages.

In 2015, about 90.5 million people worldwide had cancer. In 2019, annual cancer cases grew by 23.6 million people, and there were 10 million deaths worldwide, representing over the previous decade increases of 26% and 21%, respectively.

The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer. In females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer. If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancer cases each year, it would account for around 40% of cases. In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors are most common, except in Africa, where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often. In 2012, about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer. The risk of cancer increases significantly with age, and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries. Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world. The global total economic costs of cancer were estimated at US$1.16 trillion (equivalent to $ trillion in ) per year .


== Etymology and definitions ==
The word comes from the ancient Greek καρκίνος, meaning &#x27;crab&#x27; and &#x27;tumor&#x27;. Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, among others, noted the similarity of crabs to some tumors with swollen veins. The word was introduced in English in the modern medical sense around 1600.

Cancers comprise a large family of diseases that involve abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. They form a subset of neoplasms. A neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump, but may be distributed diffusely.
All tumor cells show the six hallmarks of cancer. These characteristics are required to produce a malignant tumor. They include:
* Cell growth and division absent the proper signals
* Continuous growth and division even given contrary signals
* Avoidance of programmed cell death
* Limitless number of cell divisions
* Promoting blood vessel construction
* Invasion of tissue and formation of metastases

The progression from normal cells to cells that can form a detectable mass to cancer involves multiple steps known as malignant progression.

== Signs and symptoms ==

When cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates. The findings that result depend on cancer&#x27;s type and location. Few symptoms are specific. Many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions. Cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a &quot;great imitator&quot;.

People may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis. The risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double.

=== Local symptoms ===
Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration. For example, mass effects from lung cancer can block the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia; esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, affecting bowel habits. Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps. Ulceration can cause bleeding that can lead to symptoms such as coughing up blood (lung cancer), anemia or rectal bleeding (colon cancer), blood in the urine (bladder cancer), or abnormal vaginal bleeding (endometrial or cervical cancer). Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial tumor is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen.

=== Systemic symptoms ===
Systemic symptoms may occur due to the body&#x27;s response to the cancer. This may include fatigue, unintentional weight loss, or skin changes. Some cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle loss and weakness, known as cachexia.

Some cancers, such as Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, leukemias, and liver or kidney cancers, can cause a persistent fever.

Shortness of breath, called dyspnea, is a common symptom of cancer and its treatment. The causes of cancer-related dyspnea can include tumors in or around the lung, blocked airways, fluid in the lungs, pneumonia, or treatment reactions including an allergic response. Treatment for dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer can include fans, bilevel ventilation, acupressure/reflexology and multicomponent nonpharmacological interventions.

Some systemic symptoms of cancer are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor, known as paraneoplastic syndromes. Common paraneoplastic syndromes include hypercalcemia, which can cause altered mental state, constipation and dehydration, or hyponatremia, which can also cause altered mental status, vomiting, headaches, or seizures.

=== Metastasis ===

Metastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize. Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.

Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both. The typical steps in metastasis are:

# Local invasion
# Intravasation into the blood or lymph.
# Circulation through the body.
# Extravasation into the new tissue.
# Proliferation
# Angiogenesis

Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs. Overall, the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain, and the bones.

While some cancers can be cured if detected early, metastatic cancer is more difficult to treat and control. Nevertheless, some recent treatments are demonstrating encouraging results.
== Causes ==

The majority of cancers, some 90–95% of cases, are due to genetic mutations from environmental and lifestyle factors. The remaining 5–10% are due to inherited genetics. &quot;Environmental&quot; refers to any cause that is not inherited, such as lifestyle, economic, and behavioral factors and not merely pollution. Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco use (25–30%), diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), lack of physical activity, and pollution. Psychological stress does not appear to be a risk factor for the onset of cancer, though it may worsen outcomes in those who already have cancer.

Environmental or lifestyle factors that caused cancer to develop in an individual can be identified by analyzing mutational signatures from genomic sequencing of tumor DNA. For example, this can reveal if lung cancer was caused by tobacco smoke, if skin cancer was caused by UV radiation, or if secondary cancers were caused by previous chemotherapy treatment.

Cancer is generally not a transmissible disease. Exceptions include rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors. However, transmissible infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr virus, Human Papilloma Virus and HIV, can contribute to the development of cancer.

=== Chemicals ===
Exposure to particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer. These substances are called &quot;carcinogens&quot;.

Tobacco smoke, for example, causes 90% of lung cancer. Tobacco use can cause cancer throughout the body including in the mouth and throat, larynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, kidney, cervix, colon/rectum, liver and pancreas. Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Tobacco is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide and about one in three in the developed world. 
Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.

Alcohol increases the risk of cancer of the breast (in women), throat, liver, oesophagus, mouth, larynx, and colon.
In Western Europe, 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol exposure, especially liver and digestive tract cancers. Cancer from work-related substance exposures may cause between 2 and 20% of cases, causing at least 200,000 deaths. Cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma can come from inhaling tobacco smoke or asbestos fibers, or leukemia from exposure to benzene.

Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is predominantly used in the production of Teflon, is known to cause two kinds of cancer.

Chemotherapy drugs such as platinum-based compounds are carcinogens that increase the risk of secondary cancers

Azathioprine, an immunosuppressive medication, is a carcinogen that can cause primary tumors to develop.

=== Diet and exercise ===

Diet, physical inactivity, and obesity are related to up to 30–35% of cancer deaths. In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of cancer deaths. A UK study including data on over 5 million people showed higher body mass index to be related to at least 10 types of cancer and responsible for around 12,000 cases each year in that country. Physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk, not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on the immune system and endocrine system. More than half of the effect from the diet is due to overnutrition (eating too much), rather than from eating too few vegetables or other healthful foods.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Some specific foods are linked to specific cancers. A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer. Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminant, causes liver cancer. Betel nut chewing can cause oral cancer. National differences in dietary practices may partly explain differences in cancer incidence. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to its high-salt diet while colon cancer is more common in the United States. Immigrant cancer profiles mirror those of their new country, often within one generation.

=== Infection ===
{{Main|Infectious causes of cancer}}
Worldwide, approximately 18% of cancer deaths are related to infectious diseases. This proportion ranges from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world. Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but bacteria and parasites may also play a role. Oncoviruses (viruses that can cause human cancer) include:

* Human papillomavirus (cervical cancer),
* Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma),
* Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas),
* Hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma)
* Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias).
* Merkel cell polyomavirus (Merkel cell carcinoma)

Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in

* &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;-induced gastric carcinoma.
* Colibactin, a genotoxin associated with &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; infection (colorectal cancer)

Parasitic infections associated with cancer include:

* &quot;Schistosoma haematobium&quot; (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder)
* The liver flukes, &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot; and &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot; (cholangiocarcinoma).

=== Radiation ===
{{Main|Radiation-induced cancer}}
Radiation exposure such as ultraviolet radiation and radioactive material is a risk factor for cancer. Many non-melanoma skin cancers are due to ultraviolet radiation, mostly from sunlight. Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging and radon gas.

Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen. Residential exposure to radon gas, for example, has similar cancer risks as passive smoking. Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon plus tobacco smoke. Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals and at any age. Children are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.

Medical use of ionizing radiation is a small but growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer. It is also used in some kinds of medical imaging.

Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.

Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission and other similar sources has been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer. Evidence, however, has not supported a concern. This includes that studies have not found a consistent link between mobile phone radiation and cancer risk.

=== Heredity ===
{{Main|Cancer syndrome}}
The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (sporadic). Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. Less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a genetic mutation that has a large effect on cancer risk and these cause less than 3–10% of cancer. Some of these syndromes include: certain inherited mutations in the genes &quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome), which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer, among others.

Statistically for cancers causing most mortality, the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer when a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has been diagnosed with it is about 2. The corresponding relative risk is 1.5 for lung cancer, and 1.9 for prostate cancer. For breast cancer, the relative risk is 1.8 with a first-degree relative having developed it at 50 years of age or older, and 3.3 when the relative developed it when being younger than 50 years of age.

Taller people have an increased risk of cancer because they have more cells than shorter people. Since height is genetically determined to a large extent, taller people have a heritable increase of cancer risk.

=== Physical agents ===
Some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects. A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma (cancer of the serous membrane) usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs. Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers, such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects. Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite and tridymite). Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhalation) and require years of exposure to produce cancer.

Physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare. Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have not been proven. Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer or brain cancer. One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present. Frequent consumption of scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer. Generally, it is believed that cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of healing, rather than directly by the trauma. However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Chronic inflammation has been hypothesized to directly cause mutation. Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing the tumor microenvironment. Oncogenes build up an inflammatory pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.

=== Hormones ===
Hormones also play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation. Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.

Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers, such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary and testis and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer. For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain their higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene. Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry and have a correspondingly higher level of prostate cancer. Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.

Other factors are relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers. Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones. On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones and lower risk of cancer. Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones. Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers.

=== Autoimmune diseases ===
There is an association between celiac disease and an increased risk of all cancers. People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment. This may be due to the adoption of a gluten-free diet, which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease. However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies. Rates of gastrointestinal cancers are increased in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis, due to chronic inflammation. Immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat these diseases may promote developing extra-intestinal malignancies.

== Pathophysiology ==
{{Main|Carcinogenesis}}

=== Genetics ===
{{Main|Oncogenomics}}

Cancer is fundamentally a disease of tissue growth regulation. For a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell, the genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered.

The affected genes are divided into two broad categories. Oncogenes are genes that promote cell growth and reproduction. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division and survival. Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes. Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.

Genetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms. The gain or loss of an entire chromosome can occur through errors in mitosis. More common are mutations, which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA.

Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal locus, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.

Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter region of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene&#x27;s coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, leading to the expression of &quot;viral&quot; oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.

Replication of the data contained within the DNA of living cells will probabilistically result in some errors (mutations). Complex error correction and prevention are built into the process and safeguard the cell against cancer. If a significant error occurs, the damaged cell can self-destruct through programmed cell death, termed apoptosis. If the error control processes fail, then the mutations will survive and be passed along to daughter cells.

Some environments make errors more likely to arise and propagate. Such environments can include the presence of disruptive substances called carcinogens, repeated physical injury, heat, ionising radiation, or hypoxia.

The errors that cause cancer are self-amplifying and compounding, for example:
* A mutation in the error-correcting machinery of a cell might cause that cell and its children to accumulate errors more rapidly.
* A further mutation in an oncogene might cause the cell to reproduce more rapidly and more frequently than its normal counterparts.
* A further mutation may cause loss of a tumor suppressor gene, disrupting the apoptosis signaling pathway and immortalizing the cell.
* A further mutation in the signaling machinery of the cell might send error-causing signals to nearby cells.

The transformation of a normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors, which compound into more severe errors, each progressively allowing the cell to escape more controls that limit normal tissue growth. This rebellion-like scenario is an undesirable survival of the fittest, where the driving forces of evolution work against the body&#x27;s design and enforcement of order. Once cancer has begun to develop, this ongoing process, termed &quot;clonal evolution&quot;, drives progression towards more invasive stages. Clonal evolution leads to intra-tumour heterogeneity (cancer cells with heterogeneous mutations) that complicates designing effective treatment strategies and requires an evolutionary approach to designing treatment.

Characteristic abilities developed by cancers are divided into categories, specifically evasion of apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, metastasis, reprogramming of energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction.

=== Epigenetics ===
{{Main|Cancer epigenetics}}
The classical view of cancer is a set of diseases driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes, and in chromosomal abnormalities. A role for epigenetic alterations was identified in the early 21st century.

Epigenetic alterations are functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not change the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are changes in DNA methylation (hypermethylation and hypomethylation), histone modification and changes in chromosomal architecture (caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as HMGA2 or HMGA1). Each of these alterations regulates gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These changes may remain through cell divisions, endure for multiple generations, and can be considered as equivalent to mutations.

Epigenetic alterations occur frequently in cancers. As an example, one study listed protein coding genes that were frequently altered in their methylation in association with colon cancer. These included 147 hypermethylated and 27 hypomethylated genes. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers.

While epigenetic alterations are found in cancers, the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes, causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins, may be of particular importance. Such alterations may occur early in progression to cancer and are a possible cause of the genetic instability characteristic of cancers.

Reduced expression of DNA repair genes disrupts DNA repair. This is shown in the figure at the 4th level from the top. (In the figure, red wording indicates the central role of DNA damage and defects in DNA repair in progression to cancer.) When DNA repair is deficient DNA damage remains in cells at a higher than usual level (5th level) and causes increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation (6th level). Mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR). Chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy also increase in HRR defective cells.

Higher levels of DNA damage cause increased mutation (right side of figure) and increased epimutation. During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damage, incompletely cleared repair sites can cause epigenetic gene silencing.

Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can increase cancer risks. Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article DNA repair-deficiency disorder) have increased cancer risk, with some defects ensuring a 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations). Germ line DNA repair mutations are noted on the figure&#x27;s left side. However, such germline mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers.

In sporadic cancers, deficiencies in DNA repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a DNA repair gene but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes. This is indicated in the figure at the 3rd level. Many studies of heavy metal-induced carcinogenesis show that such heavy metals cause a reduction in expression of DNA repair enzymes, some through epigenetic mechanisms. DNA repair inhibition is proposed to be a predominant mechanism in heavy metal-induced carcinogenicity. In addition, frequent epigenetic alterations of the DNA sequences code for small RNAs called microRNAs (or miRNAs). miRNAs do not code for proteins, but can &quot;target&quot; protein-coding genes and reduce their expression.

Cancers usually arise from an assemblage of mutations and epimutations that confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion (see Field defects in progression to cancer). Mutations, however, may not be as frequent in cancers as epigenetic alterations. An average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein-altering mutations, of which about three or four may be &quot;driver&quot; mutations and the remaining ones may be &quot;passenger&quot; mutations.

=== Metastasis ===
{{Main|Metastasis}}
Metastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize. Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.

Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both. The typical steps in metastasis are local invasion, intravasation into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, extravasation into the new tissue, proliferation and angiogenesis. Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain and the bones.

=== Metabolism ===
{{Main|Tumor metabolome}}

Normal cells typically generate only about 30% of energy from glycolysis, whereas most cancers rely on glycolysis for energy production (Warburg effect). But a minority of cancer types rely on oxidative phosphorylation as the primary energy source, including lymphoma, leukemia, and endometrial cancer. Even in these cases, however, the use of glycolysis as an energy source rarely exceeds 60%. A few cancers use glutamine as the major energy source, partly because it provides nitrogen required for nucleotide (DNA, RNA) synthesis. Cancer stem cells often use oxidative phosphorylation or glutamine as a primary energy source.

== Diagnosis ==
{{Refimprove-section|date=January 2025}}

Most cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of signs or symptoms or through screening. Neither of these leads to a definitive diagnosis, which requires the examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist. People with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests. These commonly include blood tests, X-rays, (contrast) CT scans and endoscopy.

The tissue diagnosis from the biopsy indicates the type of cell that is proliferating, its histological grade, genetic abnormalities and other features. Together, this information is useful to evaluate the prognosis and to choose the best treatment.

Cytogenetics and immunohistochemistry are other types of tissue tests. These tests provide information about molecular changes (such as mutations, fusion genes and numerical chromosome changes) and may thus also indicate the prognosis and best treatment.

Cancer diagnosis can cause psychological distress and psychosocial interventions, such as talking therapy, may help people with this. Some people choose to disclose the diagnosis widely; others prefer to keep the information private, especially shortly after the diagnosis, or to disclose it only partially or to selected people.

== Classification ==
{{further|List of cancer types|List of oncology-related terms}}{{Refimprove section|date=January 2025}}
Cancers are classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor. These types include:
* Carcinoma: Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers and include nearly all those in the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and colon. Most of these are of the adenocarcinoma type, which means that the cancer has gland-like differentiation.
* Sarcoma: Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develops from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside the bone marrow.
* Lymphoma and leukemia: These two classes arise from hematopoietic (blood-forming) cells that leave the marrow and tend to mature in the lymph nodes and blood, respectively.
* Germ cell tumor: Cancers derived from pluripotent cells, most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary (seminoma and dysgerminoma, respectively).
* Blastoma: Cancers derived from immature &quot;precursor&quot; cells or embryonic tissue.

Cancers are usually named using &quot;-carcinoma&quot;, &quot;-sarcoma&quot; or &quot;-blastoma&quot; as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example, cancers of the liver parenchyma arising from malignant epithelial cells is called &quot;hepatocarcinoma&quot;, while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma and a cancer arising from fat cells is called a &quot;liposarcoma&quot;. For some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called &quot;ductal carcinoma of the breast&quot;. Here, the adjective &quot;ductal&quot; refers to the appearance of cancer under the microscope, which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts.

Benign tumors (which are not cancers) are named using &quot;-oma&quot; as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a &quot;leiomyoma&quot; (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is &quot;fibroid&quot;). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the &quot;-noma&quot; suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma.

Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma.

== Prevention ==
{{Main|Cancer prevention}}
Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk. The vast majority of cancer cases are due to environmental risk factors. Many of these environmental factors are controllable lifestyle choices. Thus, cancer is generally preventable. Between 70% and 90% of common cancers are due to environmental factors and therefore potentially preventable.

Greater than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding risk factors including: tobacco, excess weight/obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol, sexually transmitted infections and air pollution. Further, poverty could be considered as an indirect risk factor in human cancers. Not all environmental causes are controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation and cancers caused through hereditary genetic disorders and thus are not preventable via personal behavior.

In 2019, ~44% of all cancer deaths – or ~4.5 M deaths or ~105 million lost disability-adjusted life years – were due to known clearly preventable risk factors, led by smoking, alcohol use and high BMI, according to a GBD systematic analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01438-6&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tran KB, Lang JJ, Compton K, Xu R, Acheson AR, Henrikson HJ, etal | title = The global burden of cancer attributable to risk factors, 2010-19: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 | language = English | journal = Lancet | volume = 400 | issue = 10352 | pages = 563–591 | date = August 2022 | pmid = 35988567 | pmc = 9395583 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01438-6 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dietary ===
{{Main|Diet and cancer}}
While many dietary recommendations have been proposed to reduce cancer risks, the evidence to support them is not definitive. The primary dietary factors that increase risk are obesity and alcohol consumption. Diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat have been implicated but reviews and meta-analyses do not come to a consistent conclusion. A 2014 meta-analysis found no relationship between fruits and vegetables and cancer. Coffee is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer. Studies have linked excessive consumption of red or processed meat to an increased risk of breast cancer, colon cancer and pancreatic cancer, a phenomenon that could be due to the presence of carcinogens in meats cooked at high temperatures. In 2015 the IARC reported that eating processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) and, to a lesser degree, red meat was linked to some cancers.

Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains and fish and an avoidance of processed and red meat (beef, pork, lamb), animal fats, pickled foods and refined carbohydrates.

=== Medication ===
Medications can be used to prevent cancer in a few circumstances. In the general population, NSAIDs reduce the risk of colorectal cancer; however, due to cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects, they cause overall harm when used for prevention. Aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of death from cancer by about 7%. COX-2 inhibitors may decrease the rate of polyp formation in people with familial adenomatous polyposis; however, it is associated with the same adverse effects as NSAIDs. Daily use of tamoxifen or raloxifene reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women. The benefit versus harm for 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor such as finasteride is not clear.

Vitamin supplementation does not appear to be effective at preventing cancer. While low blood levels of vitamin D are correlated with increased cancer risk, whether this relationship is causal and vitamin D supplementation is protective is not determined. One 2014 review found that supplements had no significant effect on cancer risk. Another 2014 review concluded that vitamin D3 may decrease the risk of death from cancer (one fewer death in 150 people treated over 5 years), but concerns with the quality of the data were noted.

Beta-Carotene supplementation increases lung cancer rates in those who are high risk. Folic acid supplementation is not effective in preventing colon cancer and may increase colon polyps. Selenium supplementation has not been shown to reduce the risk of cancer.

=== Vaccination ===
Vaccines have been developed that prevent infection by some carcinogenic viruses. Human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil and Cervarix) decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer. The hepatitis B vaccine prevents infection with hepatitis B virus and thus decreases the risk of liver cancer. The administration of human papillomavirus and hepatitis B vaccinations is recommended where resources allow.

== Screening ==
{{Main|Cancer screening}}
Unlike diagnostic efforts prompted by symptoms and medical signs, cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed, but before any noticeable symptoms appear. This may involve physical examination, blood or urine tests or medical imaging.

Cancer screening is not available for many types of cancers. Even when tests are available, they may not be recommended for everyone. &quot;Universal screening&quot; or &quot;mass screening&quot; involves screening everyone. &quot;Selective screening&quot; identifies people who are at higher risk, such as people with a family history. Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening. These factors include:
* Possible harms from the screening test: for example, X-ray images involve exposure to potentially harmful ionizing radiation
* The likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer
* The likelihood that cancer is present: Screening is not normally useful for rare cancers.
* Possible harms from follow-up procedures
* Whether suitable treatment is available
* Whether early detection improves treatment outcomes
* Whether cancer will ever need treatment
* Whether the test is acceptable to the people: If a screening test is too burdensome (for example, extremely painful), then people will refuse to participate.
* Cost

=== Recommendations ===

==== U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ====
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues recommendations for various cancers:
* Strongly recommends cervical cancer screening in women who are sexually active and have a cervix at least until the age of 65.
* Recommend that Americans be screened for colorectal cancer via fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy starting at age 50 until age 75.
* Evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening for skin cancer, oral cancer, lung cancer, or prostate cancer in men under 75.
* Routine screening is not recommended for bladder cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, or prostate cancer.
* Recommends mammography for breast cancer screening every two years from ages 50–74, but does not recommend either breast self-examination or clinical breast examination. A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that breast cancer screening by mammography had no effect in reducing mortality because of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

==== Japan ====
Screens for gastric cancer using photofluorography due to the high incidence there.

=== Genetic testing ===
{{See also|Cancer syndrome}}

Genetic testing for individuals at high risk of certain cancers is recommended by unofficial groups. Carriers of these mutations may then undergo enhanced surveillance, chemoprevention, or preventative surgery to reduce their subsequent risk.

== Management ==
{{Main|Treatment of cancer|Oncology|}}

Many treatment options for cancer exist. The primary ones include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy and palliative care. Which treatments are used depends on the type, location and grade of the cancer as well as the patient&#x27;s health and preferences. The treatment intent may or may not be curative.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

=== Chemotherapy ===
Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with one or more cytotoxic anti-neoplastic drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized regimen. The term encompasses a variety of drugs, which are divided into broad categories such as alkylating agents and antimetabolites. Traditional chemotherapeutic agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly, a critical property of most cancer cells.

It was found that providing combined cytotoxic drugs is better than a single drug, a process called the combination therapy, which has an advantage in the statistics of survival and response to the tumor and in the progress of the disease. A Cochrane review concluded that combined therapy was more effective to treat metastasized breast cancer. However, generally it is not certain whether combination chemotherapy leads to better health outcomes, when both survival and toxicity are considered.

Targeted therapy is a form of chemotherapy that targets specific molecular differences between cancer and normal cells. The first targeted therapies blocked the estrogen receptor molecule, inhibiting the growth of breast cancer. Another common example is the class of Bcr-Abl inhibitors, which are used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Currently, targeted therapies exist for many of the most common cancer types, including bladder cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, and thyroid cancer as well as other cancer types.

The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. In combination with surgery, chemotherapy has proven useful in cancer types including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and certain lung cancers. Chemotherapy is curative for some cancers, such as some leukemias, ineffective in some brain tumors, and needless in others, such as most non-melanoma skin cancers. The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by its toxicity to other tissues in the body. Even when chemotherapy does not provide a permanent cure, it may be useful to reduce symptoms such as pain or to reduce the size of an inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will become possible in the future.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

=== Radiation ===
Radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or improve symptoms. It works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue, causing mitotic catastrophe resulting in the death of the cancer cells. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs, which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from multiple exposure angles to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. As with chemotherapy, cancers vary in their response to radiation therapy.

Radiation therapy is used in about half of cases. The radiation can be either from internal sources (brachytherapy) or external sources. The radiation is most commonly low energy X-rays for treating skin cancers, while higher energy X-rays are used for cancers within the body. Radiation is typically used in addition to surgery and or chemotherapy. For certain types of cancer, such as early head and neck cancer, it may be used alone. Radiation therapy after surgery for brain metastases has been shown to not improve overall survival in patients compared to surgery alone. For painful bone metastasis, radiation therapy has been found to be effective in about 70% of patients.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery is the primary method of treatment for most isolated, solid cancers and may play a role in palliation and prolongation of survival. It is typically an important part of definitive diagnosis and staging of tumors, as biopsies are usually required. In localized cancer, surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with, in certain cases, the lymph nodes in the area. For some types of cancer this is sufficient to eliminate the cancer.

=== Palliative care ===
Palliative care is treatment that attempts to help the patient feel better and may be combined with an attempt to treat the cancer. Palliative care includes action to reduce physical, emotional, spiritual and psycho-social distress. Unlike treatment that is aimed at directly killing cancer cells, the primary goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life.

People at all stages of cancer treatment typically receive some kind of palliative care. In some cases, medical specialty professional organizations recommend that patients and physicians respond to cancer only with palliative care. This applies to patients who:

Palliative care may be confused with hospice and therefore only indicated when people approach end of life. Like hospice care, palliative care attempts to help the patient cope with their immediate needs and to increase comfort. Unlike hospice care, palliative care does not require people to stop treatment aimed at the cancer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

Multiple national medical guidelines recommend early palliative care for patients whose cancer has produced distressing symptoms or who need help coping with their illness. In patients first diagnosed with metastatic disease, palliative care may be immediately indicated. Palliative care is indicated for patients with a prognosis of less than 12 months of life even given aggressive treatment.

=== Immunotherapy ===
{{Main|Cancer immunotherapy}}
A variety of therapies using immunotherapy, stimulating or helping the immune system to fight cancer, have come into use since 1997. Approaches include:

* Monoclonal antibody therapy
* Checkpoint therapy (therapy that targets the immune checkpoints or regulators of the immune system)
* Adoptive cell transfer

=== Laser therapy ===
{{Main|Lasers in cancer treatment}}
Laser therapy uses high-intensity light to treat cancer by shrinking or destroying tumors or precancerous growths. Lasers are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers that are on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs. It is used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like cervical, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and non-small cell lung cancer. It is often combined with other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT), or interstitial laser photocoagulation, uses lasers to treat some cancers using hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer cells. Laser are more precise than surgery and cause less damage, pain, bleeding, swelling, and scarring. A disadvantage is surgeons must have specialized training. It may be more expensive than other treatments.

=== Alternative medicine ===
Complementary and alternative cancer treatments are a diverse group of therapies, practices and products that are not part of conventional medicine. &quot;Complementary medicine&quot; refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while &quot;alternative medicine&quot; refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine. Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been studied or tested using conventional techniques such as clinical trials. Some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted. Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers stated, &quot;The label &#x27;unproven&#x27; is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been &#x27;disproven&#x27;.&quot;

== Prognosis ==
{{See also|Cancer survival rates|List of cancer mortality rates in the United States|Cancer survivor}}
Survival rates vary by cancer type and by the stage at which it is diagnosed, ranging from majority survival to complete mortality five years after diagnosis. Once a cancer has metastasized, prognosis normally becomes much worse. About half of patients receiving treatment for invasive cancer (excluding carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; and non-melanoma skin cancers) die from that cancer or its treatment. A majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases of the primary tumor.

Survival is worse in the developing world, partly because the types of cancer that are most common there are harder to treat than those associated with developed countries.

Those who survive cancer develop a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed. The increased risk is believed to be due to the random chance of developing any cancer, the likelihood of surviving the first cancer, the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, unwanted side effects of treating the first cancer (particularly radiation therapy), and better compliance with screening.

Predicting short- or long-term survival depends on many factors. The most important are the cancer type and the patient&#x27;s age and overall health. Those who are with other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people. Centenarians are unlikely to survive for five years even if treatment is successful. People who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer. People with lower quality of life may be affected by depression and other complications and/or disease progression that both impairs quality and quantity of life. Additionally, patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report poorer quality of life because they perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

People with cancer have an increased risk of blood clots in their veins which can be life-threatening. The use of blood thinners such as heparin decrease the risk of blood clots but have not been shown to increase survival in people with cancer. People who take blood thinners also have an increased risk of bleeding.

Although extremely rare, some forms of cancer, even from an advanced stage, can heal spontaneously. This phenomenon is known as spontaneous remission.

|align=right

Estimates are that in 2018, 18.1 million new cases of cancer and 9.6 million deaths occur globally. About 20% of males and 17% of females will get cancer at some point in time while 13% of males and 9% of females will die from it.

In 2008, approximately 12.7 million cancers were diagnosed (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers and other non-invasive cancers) and in 2010 nearly 7.98 million people died. Cancers account for approximately 16% of deaths. The most common {{as of|2018|lc=yes}} are lung cancer (1.76 million deaths), colorectal cancer (860,000) stomach cancer (780,000), liver cancer (780,000), and breast cancer (620,000). This makes invasive cancer the leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading in the developing world. Over half of cases occur in the developing world.

Deaths from cancer were 5.8 million in 1990. Deaths have been increasing primarily due to longer lifespans and lifestyle changes in the developing world. The most significant risk factor for developing cancer is age. Although it is possible for cancer to strike at any age, most patients with invasive cancer are over 65. According to cancer researcher Robert A. Weinberg, &quot;If we lived long enough, sooner or later we all would get cancer.&quot; Some of the association between aging and cancer is attributed to immunosenescence, errors accumulated in DNA over a lifetime and age-related changes in the endocrine system. Aging&#x27;s effect on cancer is complicated by factors such as DNA damage and inflammation promoting it and factors such as vascular aging and endocrine changes inhibiting it.

Some slow-growing cancers are particularly common, but often are not fatal. Autopsy studies in Europe and Asia showed that up to 36% of people have undiagnosed and apparently harmless thyroid cancer at the time of their deaths and that 80% of men develop prostate cancer by age 80. As these cancers do not cause the patient&#x27;s death, identifying them would have represented overdiagnosis rather than useful medical care.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

The three most common childhood cancers are leukemia (34%), brain tumors (23%) and lymphomas (12%). In the United States cancer affects about 1 in 285 children. Rates of childhood cancer increased by 0.6% per year between 1975 and 2002 in the United States and by 1.1% per year between 1978 and 1997 in Europe. Death from childhood cancer decreased by half between 1975 and 2010 in the United States.

== History ==
{{Main|History of cancer}}
Cancer has existed for all of human history. The earliest written record regarding cancer is from {{circa|1600 BC}} in the Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus and describes breast cancer. Hippocrates ({{circa|460 BC|370 BC}}) described several kinds of cancer, referring to them with the Greek word &quot;karkinos&quot; (crab or crayfish). This name comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumor, with &quot;the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet, whence it derives its name&quot;. Galen stated that &quot;cancer of the breast is so called because of the fancied resemblance to a crab given by the lateral prolongations of the tumor and the adjacent distended veins&quot;.{{rp|738}} Celsus ({{circa|25 BC}} – 50 AD) translated &quot;karkinos&quot; into the Latin &quot;cancer&quot;, also meaning crab and recommended surgery as treatment. Galen (2nd century AD) disagreed with the use of surgery and recommended purgatives instead. These recommendations largely stood for 1000 years.

In the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, it became acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death. The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius, a follower of Descartes, believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads and concluded that it was contagious.

The physician John Hill described tobacco sniffing as the cause of nose cancer in 1761. This was followed by the report in 1775 by British surgeon Percivall Pott that chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma, a cancer of the scrotum, was a common disease among chimney sweeps. With the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the &#x27;cancer poison&#x27; spread from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites (&quot;metastasis&quot;). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874.

== Society and culture ==
Although many diseases (such as heart failure) may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer, cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos. The euphemism of &quot;a long illness&quot; to describe cancers leading to death is still commonly used in obituaries, rather than naming the disease explicitly, reflecting an apparent stigma. Cancer is also euphemised as &quot;the C-word&quot;; Macmillan Cancer Support uses the term to try to lessen the fear around the disease. In Nigeria, one local name for cancer translates into English as &quot;the disease that cannot be cured&quot;. This deep belief that cancer is necessarily a difficult and usually deadly disease is reflected in the systems chosen by society to compile cancer statistics: the most common form of cancer—non-melanoma skin cancers, accounting for about one-third of cancer cases worldwide, but very few deaths—are excluded from cancer statistics specifically because they are easily treated and almost always cured, often in a single, short, outpatient procedure.

Western conceptions of patients&#x27; rights for people with cancer include a duty to fully disclose the medical situation to the person, and the right to engage in shared decision-making in a way that respects the person&#x27;s own values. In other cultures, other rights and values are preferred. For example, most African cultures value whole families rather than individualism. In parts of Africa, a diagnosis is commonly made so late that cure is not possible, and treatment, if available at all, would quickly bankrupt the family. As a result of these factors, African healthcare providers tend to let family members decide whether, when and how to disclose the diagnosis, and they tend to do so slowly and circuitously, as the person shows interest and an ability to cope with the grim news. People from Asian and South American countries also tend to prefer a slower, less candid approach to disclosure than is idealized in the United States and Western Europe, and they believe that sometimes it would be preferable not to be told about a cancer diagnosis. In general, disclosure of the diagnosis is more common than it was in the 20th century, but full disclosure of the prognosis is not offered to many patients around the world.

In the United States and some other cultures, cancer is regarded as a disease that must be &quot;fought&quot; to end the &quot;civil insurrection&quot;; a War on Cancer was declared in the US. Military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancer&#x27;s human effects, and they emphasize both the state of the patient&#x27;s health and the need to take immediate, decisive actions himself rather than to delay, to ignore or to rely entirely on others. The military metaphors also help rationalize radical, destructive treatments.
In the 1970s, a relatively popular alternative cancer treatment in the US was a specialized form of talk therapy, based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude. People with a &quot;cancer personality&quot;—depressed, repressed, self-loathing and afraid to express their emotions—were believed to have manifested cancer through subconscious desire. Some psychotherapists claimed that treatment to change the patient&#x27;s outlook on life would cure the cancer. Among other effects, this belief allowed society to blame the victim for having caused the cancer (by &quot;wanting&quot; it) or having prevented its cure (by not becoming a sufficiently happy, fearless and loving person). It also increased patients&#x27; anxiety, as they incorrectly believed that natural emotions of sadness, anger or fear shorten their lives. The idea was ridiculed by Susan Sontag, who published &quot;Illness as Metaphor&quot; while recovering from treatment for breast cancer in 1978. Although the original idea is now generally regarded as nonsense, the idea partly persists in a reduced form with a widespread, but incorrect, belief that deliberately cultivating a habit of positive thinking will increase survival. This notion is particularly strong in breast cancer culture.

One idea about why people with cancer are blamed or stigmatized, called the just-world fallacy, is that blaming cancer on the patient&#x27;s actions or attitudes allows the blamers to regain a sense of control. This is based upon the blamers&#x27; belief that the world is fundamentally just and so any dangerous illness, like cancer, must be a type of punishment for bad choices, because in a just world, bad things would not happen to good people.

=== Economic effect ===
The total health care expenditure on cancer in the US was estimated to be $80.2 billion in 2015. Even though cancer-related health care expenditure have increased in absolute terms during recent decades, the share of health expenditure devoted to cancer treatment has remained close to 5% between the 1960s and 2004. A similar pattern has been observed in Europe where about 6% of all health care expenditure are spent on cancer treatment. In addition to health care expenditure and financial toxicity, cancer causes indirect costs in the form of productivity losses due to sick days, permanent incapacity and disability as well as premature death during working age. Cancer causes also costs for informal care. Indirect costs and informal care costs are typically estimated to exceed or equal the health care costs of cancer.

=== Workplace ===
In the United States, cancer is included as a protected condition by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), mainly due to the potential for cancer having discriminating effects on workers. Discrimination in the workplace could occur if an employer holds a false belief that a person with cancer is not capable of doing a job properly, and may ask for more sick leave than other employees. Employers may also make hiring or firing decisions based on misconceptions about cancer disabilities, if present. The EEOC provides interview guidelines for employers, as well as lists of possible solutions for assessing and accommodating employees with cancer.

=== Effect on divorce ===

A study found women were around six times more likely to be divorced soon after a diagnosis of cancer compared to men. Rate of separation for cancer-survivors showed correlations with race, age, income, and comorbidities in a study. A review found a somewhat decreased divorce rate for most cancer types, and noted study heterogeneity and methodological weaknesses for many studies on effects of cancer on divorce.

== Research ==
{{Main|Cancer research}}

Because cancer is a class of diseases, it is unlikely that there will ever be a single &quot;cure for cancer&quot; any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases. Angiogenesis inhibitors were once incorrectly thought to have potential as a &quot;silver bullet&quot; treatment applicable to many types of cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors and other cancer therapeutics are used in combination to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality.

Experimental cancer treatments are studied in clinical trials to compare the proposed treatment to the best existing treatment. Treatments that succeeded in one cancer type can be tested against other types. Diagnostic tests are under development to better target the right therapies to the right patients, based on their individual biology.

Cancer research focuses on the following issues:
* Agents (e.g. viruses) and events (e.g. mutations) that cause or facilitate genetic changes in cells destined to become cancer.
* The precise nature of the genetic damage and the genes that are affected by it.
* The consequences of those genetic changes on the biology of the cell, both in generating the defining properties of a cancer cell and in facilitating additional genetic events that lead to further progression of the cancer.

The improved understanding of molecular biology and cellular biology due to cancer research has led to new treatments for cancer since US President Richard Nixon declared the &quot;War on Cancer&quot; in 1971. Since then, the country has spent over $200 billion on cancer research, including resources from public and private sectors. The cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) declined by five percent between 1950 and 2005.
Competition for financial resources appears to have suppressed the creativity, cooperation, risk-taking and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries, unduly favoring low-risk research into small incremental advancements over riskier, more innovative research. Other consequences of competition appear to be many studies with dramatic claims whose results cannot be replicated and perverse incentives that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and facilities.

Virotherapy, which uses convert viruses, is being studied.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a worry that cancer research and treatment are slowing down.

On 2 December 2023, Nano Today published a groundbreaking discovery involving &quot;NK cell-engaging nanodrones&quot; for targeted cancer treatment. The development of &quot;NK cell-engaging nanodrones&quot; represents a significant leap forward in cancer treatment, showcasing how cutting-edge nanotechnology and immunotherapy can be combined to target and eliminate cancer cells with unprecedented precision. These nanodrones are designed to harness the power of natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in the body&#x27;s immune response against tumors. By directing these NK cells specifically to the sites of tumors, the nanodrones can effectively concentrate the immune system&#x27;s attack on the cancer cells, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.

The key innovation here lies in the use of protein cage nanoparticle-based systems. These systems are engineered to carry signals that attract NK cells directly to the tumor, overcoming one of the major challenges in cancer immunotherapy: ensuring that the immune cells find and attack only the cancer cells without harming healthy tissue. This targeted approach not only increases the efficacy of the treatment but also minimizes side effects, a common concern with broader-acting cancer therapies.

== Pregnancy ==
Cancer affects approximately 1 in 1,000 pregnant women. The most common cancers found during pregnancy are the same as the most common cancers found in non-pregnant women during childbearing ages: breast cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.

Diagnosing a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy. As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average. Some imaging procedures, such as MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scans, ultrasounds and mammograms with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as PET scans, are not.

Treatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women. However, radiation and radioactive drugs are normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries are often used to advance the start of treatment. Surgery is generally safe, but pelvic surgeries during the first trimester may cause miscarriage. Some treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester, increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).

Elective abortions are not required and, for the most common forms and stages of cancer, do not improve the mother&#x27;s survival. In a few instances, such as advanced uterine cancer, the pregnancy cannot be continued and in others, the patient may end the pregnancy so that she can begin aggressive chemotherapy.

Some treatments can interfere with the mother&#x27;s ability to give birth vaginally or to breastfeed. Cervical cancer may require birth by Caesarean section. Radiation to the breast reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of mastitis. Also, when chemotherapy is given after birth, many of the drugs appear in breast milk, which could harm the baby.

== Other animals ==
Veterinary oncology, concentrating mainly on cats and dogs, is a growing specialty in wealthy countries and the major forms of human treatment such as surgery and radiotherapy may be offered. The most common types of cancer differ, but the cancer burden seems at least as high in pets as in humans. Animals, typically rodents, are often used in cancer research and studies of natural cancers in larger animals may benefit research into human cancer.

Across wild animals, there is still limited data on cancer. Nonetheless, a study published in 2022, explored cancer risk in (non-domesticated) zoo mammals, belonging to 191 species, 110,148 individual, demonstrated that cancer is a ubiquitous disease of mammals and it can emerge anywhere along the mammalian phylogeny. This research also highlighted that cancer risk is not uniformly distributed along mammals. For instance, species in the order Carnivora are particularly prone to be affected by cancer (e.g. over 25% of clouded leopards, bat-eared foxes and red wolves die of cancer), while ungulates (especially even-toed ungulates) appear to face consistently low cancer risks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

In non-humans, a few types of transmissible cancer have also been described, wherein the cancer spreads between animals by transmission of the tumor cells themselves. This phenomenon is seen in dogs with Sticker&#x27;s sarcoma (also known as canine transmissible venereal tumor), and in Tasmanian devils with devil facial tumour disease (DFTD).

<doc id="105222" wikidata="Q74195" url="?curid=105222" title="Menlo Park, California">
<text>Menlo Park ( ) is a city at the eastern edge of San Mateo County in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, United States. It is bordered by San Francisco Bay on the north and east; East Palo Alto, Palo Alto, and Stanford to the south; and Atherton, North Fair Oaks, and Redwood City to the west. It had 33,780 residents at the 2020 United States census. It is home to the corporate headquarters of Meta, and is where Google, Roblox Corporation, and Round Table Pizza were founded. The train station holds the record as the oldest continually operating train station in California. It is one of the most educated cities in California and the United States; nearly 70% of residents over 25 have earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

==Toponym==
&quot;Menlo&quot; is derived from Menlo (the anglicized spelling of Irish Gaelic &#x27;Mionloch&#x27;, meaning &#x27;small lake&#x27;) in County Galway, Ireland. The name &quot;Menlo Park&quot; was given to a ranch purchased by Irish settlers in honor of their home village in Ireland.

==History==

The area of Menlo Park was inhabited by the Ohlone people when the Portolá expedition arrived in 1769.

In 1795, the Rancho de las Pulgas Spanish land grant was made that included the area of the current city.

===Original Menlo Park gate===
In 1851, two Irish immigrants, Dennis J. Oliver and his brother-in-law, D.C. McGlynn, purchased a tract of land on the former Rancho de las Pulgas. In 1854, they erected a gate with a wooden arch bearing the inscription &quot;Menlo Park&quot; and the date &quot;August 1854&quot; at the entrance to their property (now the intersection of Middle Ave and El Camino Real).

===Railroad===
In 1863, the San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road had built the railroad from San Francisco to as far as Mayfield (now California Avenue station in Palo Alto) and started running trains to the area. They named a nearby station &quot;Menlo Park&quot; after the sign. The 1867 station building still stands on the platform of the current Caltrain station, used by the local Chamber of Commerce. It holds the record as the oldest, continually operating train station in California. The town of Menlo Park grew up around this station, becoming a popular home for San Francisco businessmen. A post office was established in 1870, and the city was incorporated in 1874 (it dissolved after two years, but later was permanently incorporated in 1927). The original arch, which gave its name to the stations and ultimately, the city, survived until 1922, when it was destroyed in an automobile accident. The origin of the name of Menlo Park, California () antedates any work done by Thomas Edison () in Menlo Park, New Jersey; Menlo Park, New Jersey, was named after Menlo Park, California, as was Menlo, Washington.

===Camp Fremont===
In 1917–18, a large portion of Menlo Park was the site of Camp Fremont, a training camp for, at its height, 27,000 men being sent to fight in World War I. It did not last long (the camp was dismantled after the war), but army engineers paved the first streets in Menlo Park and laid the first water and gas lines. The army did retain the camp hospital, and it is now the site of a Veterans Administration Hospital off of Willow Road in Menlo Park. In the autumn of 1918, a flu pandemic hit Camp Fremont and killed 147.

===Dibble General Hospital===
At the start of World War II, the US government bought the estate of Timothy Hopkins from his widow and created the Palo Alto General Hospital, later renamed the Dibble General Hospital (after Colonel John Dibble, who was killed in 1943). After the war ended, some of the land was sold to the city and became the sites of the main library and city hall. More of the land was bought by Stanford University to house the increase in students due to the G.I. Bill; the area was known as the &quot;Stanford Village&quot;, which existed as student housing until the mid-1960s. This land also was the site of the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) starting in 1947; between 1955 and 1968, SRI bought the rest of the Stanford Village.

===&quot;Sunset&quot; magazine headquarters===
&quot;Sunset&quot; magazine moved to its headquarters in Menlo Park in 1951, designed by architect, Cliff May, with a similar layout to a California ranch-style house. &quot;Sunset&quot; referred to its Menlo Park headquarters as the Laboratory of Western Living.

===Sharon Heights===
In the 1960s, the former estate of Frederick W. Sharon (1859–1914) (son of Senator William Sharon) and his wife, Louise Tevis Breckinridge Sharon (1858–1938; daughter of Lloyd Tevis and divorced wife of John Witherspoon Breckinridge), in the hills of south west Menlo Park was developed and called &quot;Sharon Heights&quot;.

===Development of Google===
The development of leading Internet search engine provider Google occurred in 1998 in the garage in a Menlo Park home owned by Susan Wojcicki. Wojcicki&#x27;s Menlo Park garage was used as the office for Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin for $1,700 a month.

===Replica of Menlo Park gate===
In 2015, the Menlo Park Historical Association (MPHA) began a project to raise funds for and build a replica of the original Menlo Park gates. The chosen site was at 800 Alma Street in front of the Menlo Park public library. The replica was completed in 2019. On March 17, 2019, Menlo Park Mayor Ray Mueller officially dedicated the reproduction of the Menlo Gates.

==Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are covered by water. Menlo Park is long and narrow on a northeast to southwest axis. The northeast portion borders the San Francisco Bay and includes the Dumbarton Bridge that connects Menlo Park to Fremont on the east side of the bay. The city shoreline includes the city&#x27;s largest park, Bedwell Bayfront Park () and the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. San Francisquito Creek marks much of the southeast border of the city. West Menlo Park (unincorporated area) along Alameda de las Pulgas nearly separates the southwestern part of the city (known as Sharon Heights) from the rest. The extreme southwest is clipped by Interstate 280.

The Bayshore Freeway (part of U.S. Route 101) traverses Menlo Park northwest to southeast near the shoreline and somewhat parallel to the Bayshore Freeway to the southwest is El Camino Real. The intersection of El Camino Real and Santa Cruz Avenue is considered the heart of the city. Nearby, the Menlo Park Civic Center is bounded by Ravenswood Avenue, Alma Street, Laurel Street, and Burgess Drive. It contains the council offices, library, police station, and Burgess Park, which has various recreational facilities. Other major roads include Sand Hill Road in the Sharon Heights area.

The residential areas of Menlo Park can be unofficially divided into several neighborhoods. From &quot;east&quot; (northeast toward San Francisco Bay) to &quot;west&quot; (southwest toward the Pacific Coast), they are defined by the &quot;Palo Alto Weekly&quot; as: Belle Haven is the only neighborhood east of Route 101; much of the rest of that area is business or protected land. Between 101 and the roughly parallel Middlefield Road are the neighborhoods of the Willows, Suburban Park, Lorelei Manor, Flood Triangle, Vintage Oaks, and South of Seminary (the seminary being Saint Patrick&#x27;s Seminary). Between Middlefield and El Camino Real are the Caltrain track and Felton Gables, Linfield Oaks, and Park Forest. West of El Camino until the foothills of the Peninsula are the neighborhoods of Downtown Menlo Park, Central Menlo Park, and Allied Arts (sometimes also known as Stanford Park, it is named for the Allied Arts Guild in it). In the hills are Sharon Heights and Stanford Hills. Several other neighborhoods are closely associated with Menlo Park but are actually in unincorporated San Mateo county; these include Menlo Oaks and Fair Oaks (latter part of the North Fair Oaks census area) between Bayshore and Middlefield, University Heights (also known as West Menlo Park) between Sharon Heights and most of the rest of the city, and Stanford Weekend Acres, which is somewhat near Stanford Hills.

== Transportation ==
Santa Cruz Avenue runs as the &quot;Main Street&quot; within Menlo Park; terminates at El Camino Real which runs concurrently with California State Route 82. The city is also the western end of the Dumbarton Bridge, which connects Menlo Park with the East Bay city of Fremont; the Menlo Park end is located immediately adjacent to Meta Platforms&#x27; headquarters. The city is flanked by U.S. Route 101 on its eastern end and by Interstate 280 on its western end.

Menlo Park&#x27;s transit is primarily served by its eponymous train station, served by Caltrain. SamTrans is the primary provider of bus transport throughout the city. Menlo Park&#x27;s eastern ends were previously considered for a short-lived BART extension along the Bayshore Freeway.

BART and Caltrain are also the primary transit modes for Menlo Park&#x27;s connections to the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s airports. Menlo Park is located about halfway between San Francisco International Airport and San Jose International Airport; the former can be accessed by using Caltrain and either BART&#x27;s Red, or Yellow Line during 3-line service, or SamTrans route 292 (both connecting to Caltrain at Millbrae station), while the latter connects to Menlo Park through Caltrain and VTA services through a transfer at Diridon station. Drivers to and from Menlo Park can connect to both San Jose and San Francisco airports through using US 101. Oakland Airport is the farthest of the three major Bay Area airports from Menlo Park, with drivers having to cross the Bay through one of the three bridges across it, and transit users needing to use either the Dumbarton Express, SamTrans, or Caltrain to connect to BART services..

<doc id="105223" wikidata="Q192466" url="?curid=105223" title="Homocysteine">
<text>Homocysteine (; symbol Hcy) is a non-proteinogenic α-amino acid. It is a homologue of the amino acid cysteine, differing by an additional methylene bridge (-CH2-). It is biosynthesized from methionine by the removal of its terminal Cε methyl group. In the body, homocysteine can be recycled into methionine or converted into cysteine with the aid of vitamin B6, B9, and B12.

High levels of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia) is regarded as a marker of cardiovascular disease, likely working through atherogenesis, which can result in ischemic injury. Therefore, hyperhomocysteinemia is a possible risk factor for coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque blocks blood flow to the coronary arteries, which supply the heart with oxygenated blood.

Hyperhomocysteinemia has been correlated with the occurrence of blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes, although it is unclear whether hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for these conditions. Hyperhomocysteinemia has also been associated with early-term spontaneous abortions and with neural tube defects.

== Structure ==

Homocysteine exists at neutral pH values as a zwitterion.

==Biosynthesis and biochemical roles==

Homocysteine is biosynthesized naturally via a multi-step process. First, methionine receives an adenosine group from ATP, a reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-methionine synthetase, to give &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e). SAM-e then transfers the methyl group to an acceptor molecule, (e.g., norepinephrine as an acceptor during epinephrine synthesis, DNA methyltransferase as an intermediate acceptor in the process of DNA methylation). The adenosine is then hydrolyzed to yield -homocysteine. -Homocysteine has two primary fates: conversion via tetrahydrofolate (THF) back into -methionine or conversion to -cysteine.

===Biosynthesis of cysteine===
Mammals biosynthesize the amino acid cysteine via homocysteine. Cystathionine β-synthase catalyses the condensation of homocysteine and serine to give cystathionine. This reaction uses pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. Cystathionine γ-lyase then converts this double amino acid to cysteine, ammonia, and α-ketobutyrate. Bacteria and plants rely on a different pathway to produce cysteine, relying on &quot;O&quot;-acetylserine.

===Methionine salvage===
Homocysteine can be recycled into methionine. This process uses N5-methyl tetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor and cobalamin (vitamin B12)-related enzymes. More detail on these enzymes can be found in the article for methionine synthase.

===Other reactions of biochemical significance===
Homocysteine can cyclize to give homocysteine thiolactone, a five-membered heterocycle. Because of this &quot;self-looping&quot; reaction, homocysteine-containing peptides tend to cleave themselves by reactions generating oxidative stress.

Homocysteine also acts as an allosteric antagonist at Dopamine D2 receptors.

It has been proposed that both homocysteine and its thiolactone may have played a significant role in the appearance of life on the early Earth.

==Homocysteine levels==

Homocysteine levels typically are higher in men than women, and increase with age.

Common levels in Western populations are 10 to 12 μmol/L, and levels of 20 μmol/L are found in populations with low B-vitamin intakes or in the elderly (e.g., Rotterdam, Framingham).

It is decreased with methyl folate trapping, where it is accompanied by decreased methylmalonic acid, increased folate, and a decrease in formiminoglutamic acid. This is the opposite of MTHFR C677T mutations, which result in an increase in homocysteine.

The ranges above are provided as examples only; test results always should be interpreted using the range provided by the laboratory that produced the result.

==Elevated homocysteine==

Abnormally high levels of homocysteine in the serum, above 15 μmol/L, are a medical condition called hyperhomocysteinemia. This has been claimed to be a significant risk factor for the development of a wide range of diseases, in total more than 100 including thrombosis, neuropsychiatric illness, in particular dementia and fractures. It also is found to be associated with microalbuminuria (moderately increased albuminuria), which is a strong indicator of the risk of future cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction. Vitamin B12 deficiency, even when coupled with high serum folate levels, has been found to increase overall homocysteine concentrations as well.

Typically, hyperhomocysteinemia is managed with vitamin B6, vitamin B9, and vitamin B12 supplementation. However, supplementation with these vitamins does not appear to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes.

<doc id="105224" wikidata="Q733359" url="?curid=105224" title="Space Ritual">
<text>Space Ritual (officially known as The Space Ritual Alive in Liverpool and London) is a 1973 live double album recorded in 1972 by UK rock band Hawkwind. It is their fourth album since their debut, &quot;Hawkwind&quot;, in 1970. It reached number 9 in the UK Albums Chart and briefly dented the &quot;Billboard Hot 200&quot;, peaking at number 179.

==Background==
The album was recorded during the tour to promote their &quot;Doremi Fasol Latido&quot; album, which comprises the bulk of this set. In addition there are new tracks (&quot;Born To Go&quot;, &quot;Upside Down&quot; and &quot;Orgone Accumulator&quot;) and the songs are interspersed by electronic and spoken pieces, making this one continuous performance. Their recent hit single &quot;Silver Machine&quot; was excluded from the set, and only &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; remains from their first two albums.

The Space Ritual show attempted to create a full audio-visual experience, representing themes developed by Barney Bubbles and Robert Calvert entwining the fantasy of starfarers in suspended animation travelling through time and space with the concept of the music of the spheres. The performance featured dancers Stacia, Miss Renee and Tony Carrera, stage set by Bubbles, lightshow by Liquid Len and poetry recitations by Calvert. On entering the venue, audience members were given a programme (reproduced on the 1996 remaster CD) featuring a short sci-fi story by Bubbles setting the band in a Starfarers scenario returning to Earth.

The original release featured edits and overdubs, the sleeve notes explaining that &quot;We had to cut a piece out of Brainstorm and Time We Left because they were too long&quot;, but the 1985 &quot;Space Ritual Volume 2&quot; album contains the full unedited versions. A previously unheard edited version of &quot;You Shouldn&#x27;t Do That&quot; (segued with an unlisted &quot;Seeing It As You Really Are&quot;) from this concert was included on the 1976 &quot;Roadhawks&quot; compilation album, then subsequently included as a bonus track on the 1996 remaster CD. The full unedited version of the track can be found on the &quot;Hawkwind Anthology&quot; album. June 2007 saw another EMI 2CD remaster issue with different bonus tracks and DVD-audio - this remaster would be reissued in 2013, minus the DVD-audio.

&quot;Sonic Attack&quot; had been written by science fiction author Michael Moorcock, who often performed with the band when convenient and Calvert was unavailable. Here it is recited by Calvert and it was scheduled for single release, promotional copies being distributed in a cloth sleeve, but it never did receive a full release.

==Recording==
The album was recorded at Liverpool Stadium, 22 December 1972 and Brixton Sundown, 30 December 1972 by Vic Maile and the Pye Mobile. It was produced by Hawkwind, then mixed by Vic Maile and Anton Matthews at Olympic Studios, Barnes. The bonus track &quot;You Shouldn&#x27;t Do That&quot; was recorded at Brixton Sundown, 30 December 1972, and originally released on the &quot;Roadhawks&quot; compilation album. &quot;Master Of The Universe&quot; and &quot;Born To Go&quot;, bonus tracks on the 1996 2CD release, were recorded at The Roundhouse, 13 February 1972, and originally released on the &quot;Greasy Truckers Party&quot; various artists album.

*&quot;The Awakening&quot; is a spoken piece which had previously been printed in the Hawklog which accompanied the group&#x27;s 1971 &quot;In Search of Space&quot; album.
*&quot;Black Corridor&quot; is a spoken piece, adapted from the Michael Moorcock book of the same name.
*&quot;Orgone Accumulator&quot; lyrics were inspired by Wilhelm Reich. Pop Will Eat Itself covered the song in 1987 on their &quot;Love Missile F1-11&quot; single.

==Sleeve==

The sleeve was designed by Barney Bubbles and came in 3x2 panel foldout, the outer 6 panels being colour, the inner 6 panels being monochrome, the discs in psychedelic patterned orange &amp; yellow inner sleeves were folded into this.

==Space Ritual Live 2014==
On 22 February 2014, Hawkwind performed a one-off show at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, London in conjunction with Rock 4 Rescue in aid of various animal charities (Wet Nose Animal Aid, Animals Asia Foundation, Team Badger and Doris Banham Dog Rescue). The night consisted of two sets, the second being an almost entire run-through of the original Space Ritual album - &quot;Electronic Number 1&quot; being replaced by a new electronic instrumental piece titled &quot;A Step into Space&quot;. The event was compered by TV presenter Matthew Wright, and the group were joined by former Soft Machine guitarist John Etheridge on &quot;Down Through The Night&quot; and &quot;Space Is Deep&quot;, while &quot;Sonic Attack&quot; was recited from a pre-recording by Brian Blessed who had been involved in other Team Badger projects including the &quot;Save the Badger Badger Badger&quot; single with Brian May.

<text>The Académie Française (), also known as the French Academy, is the principal French council for matters pertaining to the French language. The Académie was officially established in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister to King Louis XIII. Suppressed in 1793 during the French Revolution, it was restored as a division of the in 1803 by Napoleon Bonaparte. It is the oldest of the five of the institute. The body has the duty of acting as an official authority on the language; it is tasked with publishing an official dictionary of the language.

The Académie comprises forty members, known as (&quot;the immortals&quot;). New members are elected by the members of the Académie itself. Academicians normally hold office for life, but they may resign or be dismissed for misconduct. Philippe Pétain, named Marshal of France after the Battle of Verdun of World War I, was elected to the Académie in 1931 and, after his governorship of Vichy France in World War II, was forced to resign his seat in 1945.

==History==
The Académie had its origins in an informal literary group deriving from the salons held at the Hôtel de Rambouillet during the late 1620s and early 1630s. The group began meeting at Valentin Conrart&#x27;s house, seeking informality. There were then nine members. Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of France, made himself protector of the group, and in anticipation of the formal creation of the academy, new members were appointed in 1634. On 22 February 1635, at Richelieu&#x27;s urging, King Louis XIII granted letters patent formally establishing the council; according to the letters patent registered at the Parlement de Paris on 10 July 1637, the was &quot;to labor with all the care and diligence possible, to give exact rules to our language, to render it capable of treating the arts and sciences&quot;. The has remained responsible for the regulation of French grammar, spelling, and literature.

Richelieu&#x27;s model, the first academy devoted to eliminating the &quot;impurities&quot; of a language, was the , founded in Florence in 1582, which formalized the already dominant position of the Tuscan dialect of Florence as the model for Italian; the Florentine academy had published its &quot;Vocabolario&quot; in 1612.

During the French Revolution, the National Convention suppressed all royal academies, including the . In 1792, the election of new members to replace those who died was prohibited; in 1793, the academies were themselves abolished. They were all replaced in 1795 by a single body called the . Napoleon Bonaparte, as First Consul, decided to restore the former academies, but only as &quot;classes&quot; or divisions of the . The second class of the Institut was responsible for the French language, and corresponded to the former . When King Louis XVIII came to the throne in 1816, each class regained the title of &quot;Académie&quot;; accordingly, the second class of the Institut became the . Since 1816, the existence of the has been uninterrupted.

The President of France is the &quot;protector&quot; or patron of the Académie. Cardinal Richelieu originally adopted this role; upon his death in 1642, Pierre Séguier, the Chancellor of France, succeeded him. King Louis XIV adopted the function when Séguier died in 1672; since then, the French head of state has always served as the Académie&#x27;s protector. From 1672 to 1805, the official meetings of the Académie were in the Louvre; since 1805, the has met in the Collège des Quatre-Nations (known now as the Palais de l&#x27;Institut). The remaining academies of the also meet in the Palais de l&#x27;Institut.

==Membership==
The has forty seats, each of which is assigned a separate number. Candidates make their applications for a specific seat, not to the Académie in general: if several seats are vacant, a candidate may apply separately for each. Since a newly elected member is required to eulogize their predecessor in the installation ceremony, it is not uncommon that potential candidates refuse to apply for particular seats because they dislike the predecessors.

Members are known as (&quot;the Immortals&quot;) in reference to the Académie&#x27;s motto, (&quot;To Immortality&quot;), which is inscribed on the official seal of the charter granted by Cardinal Richelieu.

One of the is chosen by their colleagues to be the Académie&#x27;s Perpetual Secretary. The Secretary is called &quot;Perpetual&quot;, as the holder serves for life, but holds the ability to resign; they may thereafter be styled as &quot;Honorary Perpetual Secretary&quot;, with three post-World War II Perpetual Secretaries having previously resigned due to old age. The Perpetual Secretary acts as a chairperson and chief representative of the Académie. The two other officers, a Director and a Chancellor, are elected for three-month terms. The most senior member, by date of election, is the Dean of the Académie.

New members are elected by the Académie itself; the original members were appointed. When a seat becomes vacant, a person may apply to the Secretary if they wish to become a candidate. Alternatively, existing members may nominate other candidates. A candidate is elected by a majority of votes from voting members. A quorum is twenty members. If no candidate receives an absolute majority, another election must be performed at a later date. The election is valid only if the protector of the Académie, the President of France, grants their approval. The President&#x27;s approbation is only a formality.

The new member is then installed at a meeting of the Académie. The new member must deliver a speech to the Académie, which includes a eulogy for the member being replaced. This is followed by a speech made by one of the members. Eight days thereafter, a public reception is held, during which the new member makes a speech thanking their colleagues for their election. On one occasion, one newly installed member, Georges de Porto-Riche, was not accorded a reception, as the eulogy he made of his predecessor was considered unsatisfactory, and he refused to rewrite it. Georges Clemenceau refused to be received, as he feared being received by his enemy, Raymond Poincaré.

Members remain in the Académie for life. The council may dismiss an academician for grave misconduct. The first dismissal occurred in 1638, when Auger de Moléon de Granier was expelled for theft. The most recent dismissals occurred at the end of World War II: Philippe Pétain, Abel Bonnard, Abel Hermant, and Charles Maurras were all excluded for their association with the Vichy regime. In total, 20 members have been expelled from the Académie.

There have been a total of 742 , of whom eleven have been women; Marguerite Yourcenar was the first woman to be elected, in 1980, but there have been 25 unsuccessful female candidacies, dating from 1874. Individuals who are not citizens of France may be, and have been, elected. Moreover, although most academicians are writers, it is not necessary to be a member of the literary profession to become a member. The Académie has included numerous politicians, lawyers, scientists, historians, philosophers, and senior Roman Catholic clergymen. Five French heads of state have been members – Adolphe Thiers, Raymond Poincaré, Paul Deschanel, Philippe Pétain, and Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing – and one foreign head of state, the poet Léopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal, who was also the first African elected, in 1983. Other famous members include Voltaire; Montesquieu; Victor Hugo; Alexandre Dumas, fils; Émile Littré; Louis Pasteur; Louis de Broglie; and Henri Poincaré.

Many notable French writers have not become members of the . In 1855, the writer Arsène Houssaye devised the expression &quot;forty-first seat&quot; for deserving individuals who were never elected to the Académie, either because their candidacies were rejected, because they were never candidates, or because they died before appropriate vacancies arose. Notable French authors who never became academicians include Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jean-Paul Sartre, Joseph de Maistre, Honoré de Balzac, René Descartes, Denis Diderot, Romain Rolland, Charles Baudelaire, Gustave Flaubert, Molière, Marcel Proust, Jules Verne, Théophile Gautier, and Émile Zola.

===Uniform===

The official uniform of a member is known as , or green clothing. The , worn at the Académie&#x27;s formal ceremonies, was first adopted during Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s reorganization of the . It consists of a long black coat and black-feathered bicorne, both richly embroidered with green leafy motifs, together with black trousers or skirt. Further, members other than clergy carry a ceremonial sword ().

The members bear the cost of their uniforms themselves. The robes cost around $50,000, and Amin Maalouf said that his induction cost him some $230,000 overall. The swords can be particularly expensive as they are individually designed. Some new members have had funds for them raised by committees.

==Role as authority on the French language==

The Académie is France&#x27;s official authority on the usages, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language.

===Dictionary===
The Académie publishes a dictionary of the French language, known as the , which is regarded as official in France. A special commission composed of several (but not all) of the members of the Académie compiles the work.

The Académie has published thirteen editions of the dictionary, of which three were preliminary, eight were complete, and two were supplements for specialised words. These are:

* Preliminary editions:
** (from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Aversion&quot;), pre-edition, Frankfurt am Main, 1687
** (from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Confiture&quot;), pre-edition, Frankfurt am Main, 1687
** (from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Neuf&quot;), pre-edition, Paris, 1687
* Complete editions:
** (&quot;1st edition&quot;), Paris, 1694
** (&quot;2nd edition&quot;), Paris, 1718
** (&quot;3rd edition&quot;), Paris, 1740
** (&quot;4th edition&quot;), Paris, 1762
** (&quot;5th edition&quot;), Paris, 1798
** (&quot;6th edition&quot;), Paris, 1835
** (&quot;7th edition&quot;), Paris, 1879
** (&quot;8th edition&quot;), Paris, 1932–1935
* Supplementary editions for the sciences, arts, and technology:
** Corneille, Thomas, , Paris, 1694
** Barré, Louis, , Paris, 1842

The Académie is continuing work on the ninth edition, of which the first volume (&quot;A&quot; to &quot;Enzyme&quot;) appeared in 1992, to was published in 2000, and to in 2011. In 1778, the Académie attempted to compile a &quot;historical dictionary&quot; of the French language; this idea was later abandoned, the work never progressing past the letter &quot;A&quot;.

===Anglicisms===

As the use of English terms by media increased over the years, the Académie has tried to prevent the Anglicization of the French language. For example, the Académie has recommended the avoidance of loanwords from modern English (such as &quot;walkman&quot;, &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;software&quot; and &quot;e-mail&quot;), in favour of neologisms, i.e. newly coined French words derived from existing ones (&#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; respectively).

The Académie has also noted that anglicisms have been present in the French language since the 1700s, and has criticized the view that anglicisms present an &quot;invasion&quot; on the French language. It distinguishes anglicisms into three categories: some that are useful to the French language and introduced vocabulary which did not have a French equivalent at the time (the Académie cites the word &quot;confortable&quot; as an example, from the English &quot;comfortable&quot;); others that are detrimental and only establish more confusion as the original meaning of the word is distorted in translation; and others still that are useless or avoidable, a category of anglicisms used by &quot;snobs&quot; who use words from an English provenance to demarcate themselves from society and appear &quot;in vogue&quot;. For the last category of anglicisms, the Académie writes that those words are typically short-lived in French parlance. The has informed government officials to stop using English gaming terms like &quot;e-sports&quot;, it should be &quot;jeu video de competition&quot;. Likewise &quot;streamer&quot; should be &quot;joueur-animateur en direct&quot;.

===Alleged conservatism===

The Académie, despite working on the modernization of the French orthography, has sometimes been criticized by many linguists for allegedly behaving in an overly conservative manner. For instance, in 1997, Lionel Jospin&#x27;s government began using the feminine noun &quot;&quot;la ministre&quot; to refer to a female minister, following the official practice of Canada, Belgium and Switzerland and a frequent, though until then unofficial, practice in France. The Académie insisted, in accordance with French grammar rules on the traditional use of the masculine noun, on the use of &quot;le ministre&quot;&quot; for a minister of either gender. In 2017, 77 linguists retaliated with an opinion column to denounce the &quot;incompetence and anachronism of the Académie&quot;. Use of either form remains highly controversial.

==Prizes==

The is responsible for awarding several different prizes in various fields (including literature, painting, poetry, theatre, cinema, history, and translation). Almost all of the prizes were created during the twentieth century, and only two prizes were awarded before 1780. In total, the Académie awards more than sixty prizes, most of them annually.

The most important prize is the Grand prix de la francophonie, which was instituted in 1986, and is funded by the governments of France, Canada, Monaco, and Morocco. Other important prizes include the &quot;Grand prix de littérature&quot; (for a literary work), the &quot;grand prix du roman&quot; (for a novel), the &quot;Grand prix de poésie de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; (for poetry), the &quot;Grand prix de philosophie&quot; (for a philosophical work), the &quot;Grand prix du cinéma&quot; (for film), and the &quot;grand prix Gobert&quot; (for a work on French history).

==Opposition of regional languages==
The intervened in June 2008 to oppose the French Government&#x27;s proposal to constitutionally offer recognition and protection to regional languages (Flemish, Alsatian, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Corsican, Occitan, Gascon, and Arpitan).

== History ==

&quot;Aniak&quot; is the Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik name for the area around present-day Aniak. The word means &quot;the place where it comes out&quot; - that is, where the Aniak River flows into the Kuskokwim. The local Yup&#x27;ik people had deserted the original village at Aniak by the early-19th century, when Russian explorers first arrived in the area.

20th-century prospectors believed that the early Russian traders discovered gold in a tributary to the Kuskokwim called &quot;Yellow River&quot; in 1832. Many think that the Yellow River these traders referred to is the Aniak River. Russian traders did discover a mercury deposit near the trading post called Kolmakov Redoubt east of Aniak in 1838. Placer gold was found by Russian traders in New York Creek east of Aniak in 1844. The Russians, however, did not engage in any significant mining activities, and it wasn&#x27;t until after Washington&#x27;s purchase of Alaska in 1867 that the American prospectors began seriously investigating the potential for prospecting along the Kuskokwim river. A handful of prospecting parties began venturing into the area, however they had to travel great distances to an area where trading posts were few and far between, so the activity was limited, especially given the exposure of other late-19th century strikes in Alaska which were better served by existing infrastructure.

The euphoria caused by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897-98 would set the stage for a change however, with thousands of prospectors across the District of Alaska poised to make a rush upon rumor of each potential new strike. One such rush was the Yellow River Stampede of 1900, in which many prospectors left Nome to venture into the Kuskokwim basin upon rumors that someone had found the Yellow River strike - despite the feven although the location of that strike was unknown. Finding precious little gold and experiencing substantial hardship, many of these folks would return to Nome following the difficult winter of 1901, but some stayed behind to continue their search. A 1906 gold-discovery at the head of the Innoko River, a tributary of the Yukon River, caused another gold rush in 1907, with many of the prospectors choosing to access the site via the Kuskokwim River instead. Trading posts were established at the Takotna River which required riverboat service to travel the Kuskokwim river. With riverboat service now available on the Kuskokwim River, prospecting activity picked up, and some strikes started to occur in the Kuskokwim basin. Strikes were made at Crooked Creek, George River, New York Creek, and Aniak River among others. Most strikes were short-lived. However, the Kuskokwim River was now seeing an increase in river traffic that needed servicing.

In 1910, a lone prospector named &quot;Old Man&quot; Keeler reportedly found placer gold in the Aniak River basin. In 1911, three prospectors, Harry Buhro, E. W. &quot;Kid&quot; Fisher, and Fred Labelle, who had been working the George River area, decided to give the Aniak River basin area a try; they discovered gold at Marvel, Fisher, and Dome creeks. These creeks feed into the Aniak River about south of Aniak. Initially prospectors would reach this site by poling up the river in boats, however that was a difficult journey due to the nature of the river. The trip would take 15 to 20 days from the Kuskokwim river. By 1913, a hydraulic plant had been installed at Marvel Creek and in 1914 construction of a cat trail began, starting south of Aniak on the mouth of the Aniak Slough and proceeding to the diggings at Marvel Creek. The cat trail was last used in the spring of 2006 by miners still working claims.

This same year, Tom L. Johnson homesteaded the site of the long-abandoned Yup&#x27;ik village in the Aniak area and opened a store and post office there to service prospectors and miners in the vicinity. Willie Pete and Sam Simeon brought their Yup&#x27;ik families from Ohagamiut to Aniak. In 1936 a territorial school was opened. In anticipation of the Lend-Lease program to help supply Russia with war materials, construction of an airfield began in 1939. With the airfield in place, Aniak became the transportation hub for villages in the area including Chuathbaluk, Anvik, Kalskag, Crooked Creek, Holy Cross and others. In 1956 during the Cold War, construction of a White Alice Relay Station began bringing money, jobs, and communication capability to the area. The impact to the community from the relay station was immediate: the first telephone capable of long-distance phone calls was installed at the Aniak Lodge in 1957 and Aniak&#x27;s population more than doubled from 142 in 1950 to 308 in 1960. The 2000 census places Aniak&#x27;s population at 572.

==Education==
The Kuspuk School District operates two schools in Aniak: Auntie Mary Nicoli Elementary School and Aniak Jr/Sr High School.

<text>Bethel () is a city in the U.S. state of Alaska, located on the Kuskokwim River approximately from where the river flows into Kuskokwim Bay. It is the largest community in western Alaska and in the Unorganized Borough and the eighth-largest in the state. Bethel has a population of 6,325 as of the 2020 census, up from 6,080 in 2010.

Annual events in Bethel include the Kuskokwim 300 dogsled race; Camai, a Yup&#x27;ik dance festival held each spring; and the Bethel Fair held in August.

==History==
Southwestern Alaska has been the homelands of Yup&#x27;ik peoples and their ancestors for thousands of years. The residents of what became Bethel were called the Mamterillermiut, meaning &quot;Smokehouse People&quot;, after their nearby fish smokehouse. In the late 19th century, the Alaska Commercial Company established a trading post in the town, called Mumtrekhlogamute, which had a population of 41 people by the 1880 census.

In 1885, the Moravian Church established a mission in the area under the leadership of William and Caroline Weinland and John and Edith Kilbuck. He made Yup&#x27;ik the language of the Moravian Church in the community and region, and helped translate the Christian Bible into the language. The missionaries moved Bethel from Mamterillermiut to its present location on the west side of the Kuskokwim River. A United States post office was opened in 1905.

In 1971, Bethel established a community radio station KYUK, the first Native-owned and -operated radio station in the U.S. Similar stations were soon started in Kotzebue, and by 1990, there were 10 stations in communities of fewer than 3,500 people.

On February 19, 1997, a school shooting attracted widespread media attention to Bethel when 16-year-old Evan Ramsey, a student at Bethel Regional High School, shot and killed his principal and one student and wounded two others, for which he later received a 210-year prison sentence.

In 2009, Bethel opted out of status as a &quot;Local Option&quot; community, theoretically opening the door to allowing alcohol sales in the city; residents and city officials maintained that all liquor license requests would be actively opposed. In October 2015, though, a vote for allowing alcohol sales in Bethel passed and two liquor licenses were approved for existing stores in the city.

In 2012, pranksters distributed flyers falsely announcing the launch of a Taco Bell restaurant in Bethel, prompting Taco Bell to airlift into the town a Taco Bell food truck loaded with ingredients for 10,000 tacos.

On November 3, 2015, the Kilbuck building housing both the Ayaprun Elitnaurviat Yup&#x27;ik immersion school and the Kuskokwim Learning Academy caught fire, destroying the immersion school and damaging the boarding school. Fire fighters demolished part of the building in an effort to save a media center containing Yup&#x27;ik artifacts and elder interviews.

An extinct volcano, Tern Mountain, is visible in the distance to the south. Large, blocky, igneous rocks are a common sight in the village and the surrounding tundra.

The Kinia River (Urrsukvaaq) and its many tributaries are important to the people of the village, because of water travel to hunting and fishing areas, as well as because of difficulties presented by flooding and erosion.

==Demographics==

Chefornak first appeared on the 1950 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It formally incorporated in 1974.

Yup&#x27;ik dancing is popular in the village. The high school has an Yup&#x27;ik Dance Team which often visits other villages for feasts and festivals. Often the village hosts a dance festival in the spring, and the large Cama-i festival in Bethel attracts many from Chefornak and the surrounding villages to display their dances and to see the dances of other regions.

==Subsistence living==

Many of the villagers live a subsistence lifestyle, which means that they continue to carry out the hunter-gatherer activities that their ancestors developed adapted to the local ecosystem. Important staples include fish such as halibut, salmon, and herring, which are dried and eaten like jerky. The Alaska blackfish is an important part of the local diet, and can be caught year round in the river. Residents gather berries such as salmonberries (cloudberries), black berries (crowberries), and blueberries (bog bilberries) are also gathered and used to prepare akutaq, a whipped dessert. Other native foods that are gathered include mousefood, Labrador tea, and greens such as sourdock.

==Village buildings==
Beside houses, public buildings in the village include:
* Chefarnrmute, Inc., the village corporation
* Avugiak&#x27;s Store
* post office
* town hall/bingo hall
* school (elementary and high school are in one building)
* The Old School (formerly B.I.A. school)
* St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church
* power plant.

==Education==

The Lower Kuskokwim School District operates the Chaputnguak School, an elementary school, and Amaqigciq School, a high school, which share a building.

The Chaputnguak School was named for Chaputnguak, the original name for Chefornak and a Yup&#x27;ik word referring to an object or thing obstructing a pathway. The Amaqigciq School is named after Alexie Amaqigciq, a Yup&#x27;ik elder who selected the village site and first inhabitant of Chefornak.

==Transportation==

People access the village of Chefornak primarily by small aircraft but can also reach it via snowmobile in the winter. Goods and mail are brought into the village by plane and, during the summer months, up the Kinia River by barge. Chefornak&#x27;s airport has been moved further from the village due to concerns with its proximity to the school. The new airstrip has been constructed and is now in operation. Within the village, transportation options include four-wheel, bicycle, snow machine, and on foot.

==Demographics==

Chuathbaluk first appeared on the 1970 census as an unincorporated village. It formally incorporated in 1975. Prior to that, the community had been known as &quot;Little Russian Mission.&quot; This was not to be confused with the present city of Russian Mission (Ikogmute) on the Yukon, so it was often called the Little Russian Mission to avoid confusion. Under the prior name, it never reported a population separately.

==History==
During the 19th century, Deg Hit&#x27;an Athabascan people had summer fish camps in the area. The Russian Orthodox Church built the St. Sergius Mission by 1894, and residents of Kukuktuk from downriver moved to the mission.

Once established, village has been called Chukbak, St. Sergius Mission, Kuskokwim Russian Mission, and Little Russian Mission. The village was often confused with Russian Mission on the Yukon, so in the 1960s the name was changed to Chuathbaluk, which is derived from the Yup&#x27;ik word &quot;Curapalek&quot;, meaning &quot;the hills where the big blueberries grow.&quot;

Much of the village was lost in an influenza epidemic in 1900. By 1929, the site was deserted, although Russian Orthodox members continued to hold services at the mission. In 1954, the Crow Village Sam Phillips family from Crow Village resettled the mission, and later residents of Aniak and Crooked Creek joined their settlement. The church was rebuilt in the late 1950s, and a state school opened in the 1960s. The city was incorporated in 1975.

==Education==
The Kuspuk School District operates a K-12 rural school, Crow Village Sam School.

<text>Eek () is a city in Bethel Census Area, Alaska, United States. As of the 2020 census there were 404 residents, the majority being Alaska Natives.

==Toponymy==
Eek is derived from a Yupik word meaning &quot;two eyes&quot;. It has been noted on lists of unusual place names.

==Services==

Eek is serviced primarily by the Eek Airport. A second (former) airport east of the village is the current site of a cellular transmission tower, but the runway remains in marginally usable condition and is occasionally used by private aircraft. A town dock provides access to the Eek River, which feeds into the Kuskokwim providing access to most surrounding villages by boat. During winter months many residents utilize travel by snow machine and trails are laid out between the villages in the area. Trails from Eek run to Quinhagak to the south, Tuntutuliak to the west and the Bethel area to the north.

Airfare to the nearest large town, Bethel, is expensive, running about $250 in 2020. This severely limits medical care and governmental access.

Houses in Eek are not numbered, which makes gaining identification difficult for residents.

The Principal is Troy Poage and the school board President is Clarence Daniel. About $21,000 is spent per pupil. In 2020 the state awarded $34.4 million to create a new school in Eek to reduce severe classroom overcrowding, a result of a quickly growing population. It is expected to be finished in 2022.

Two teachers at the Eek School, Paul and Eloise Forrer, compiled a large collection of photos of Eek and surrounding villages, as well as a film entitled &quot;The Children of Eek and their art&quot;. Their work, dating mostly from the 1970s to 1990s, is held at the Anchorage Museum.

<doc id="105249" wikidata="Q936472" url="?curid=105249" title="Argent">
<text>In heraldry, argent () is the tincture of silver, and belongs to the class of light tinctures called &quot;metals&quot;. It is very frequently depicted as white and usually considered interchangeable with it. In engravings and line drawings, regions to be tinctured &quot;argent&quot; are either left blank, or indicated with the abbreviation &quot;ar&quot;.

The name derives from Latin &quot;argentum&quot;, translated as &quot;silver&quot; or &quot;white metal&quot;. The word &quot;argent&quot; had the same meaning in Old French &quot;blazon&quot;, whence it passed into the English language.

In some historical depictions of coats of arms, a kind of silver leaf was applied to those parts of the device that were argent. Over time, the silver content of these depictions has tarnished and darkened. As a result, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish regions that were intended as &quot;argent&quot; from those that were &quot;sable&quot;. This leaves a false impression that the rule of tincture has been violated in cases where, when applied next to a dark colour, argent now appears to be sable due to tarnish.

==Argent versus white==
Arthur Charles Fox-Davies argued in his book &quot;The Art of Heraldry&quot; that, though extremely rare, the colour white existed as an independent tincture in heraldry separate from argent. He bases this in part on the &quot;white labels&quot; used to differentiate the arms of members of the British royal family. However, it has been argued that these could be regarded as &quot;white labels proper&quot;, thus rendering white not a heraldic tincture.

==Poetic meaning==
The different tinctures are traditionally associated with particular heavenly bodies, precious stones, virtues, and flowers, although these associations have been mostly disregarded by serious heraldists. In addition to the metal silver, Argent is associated with:
* Of jewels, the pearl (or sometimes crystal)
* Of heavenly bodies, the Moon
* Of virtues, innocence

<text>In heraldry, gules () is the tincture with the colour red. It is one of the class of five dark tinctures called &quot;colours&quot;, the others being azure (blue), sable (black), vert (green) and purpure (purple).

Gules is portrayed in heraldic hatching by vertical lines, or indicated by the abbreviation g. or gu. when a coat of arms is tricked.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;gules&quot; derives from the Middle English &quot;goules&quot;, which itself is an Old French word meaning &quot;neckpiece made of red fur&quot;. &quot;Goules&quot; is derived from the Old French &quot;gole&quot; or &quot;guele&quot;, both of which mean &quot;throat&quot;, which are ultimately derived from the Latin &quot;gula&quot;, also meaning &quot;throat&quot;. Gules is similar to the English word &quot;gullet&quot;. A. C. Fox-Davies states that the term originates from the Persian word , meaning &quot;rose&quot;, but according to Brault there is no evidence to support this derivation.

The modern French spelling of the tincture is &quot;gueules&quot;. Both &quot;gules&quot; and &quot;rojo&quot; are used for red in Spanish heraldry. In Portugal, red is known as &quot;vermelho&quot;, and in Germany the colour is called &quot;rot&quot;. In Dutch heraldry, the tincture is called &quot;keel&quot;.

==Poetic meanings==
Centuries ago, arms were often described poetically and the tinctures were associated with different gemstones, flowers and heavenly bodies. Gules usually represented the following:
* Of jewels, the ruby
* Of heavenly bodies, Mars

* Of virtues, Courage

==Examples==

Gules is the most widely used heraldic tincture. Through the sixteenth century, nearly half of all noble coats of arms in Poland had a field gules with one or more argent charges on them.

Examples of coats of arms consisting of purely a red shield (blazoned &quot;gules plain&quot;) include those of the d&#x27;Albret family, the Rossi family, the Swiss canton of Schwyz (prior to 1815), and the old coats of arms of the cities of Nîmes and Montpellier.

<doc id="105254" wikidata="Q107738887" url="?curid=105254" title="Census tract">
<text>A census tract, census area, census district or meshblock is a geographic region defined for the purpose of taking a census. Sometimes these coincide with the limits of cities, towns or other administrative areas and several tracts commonly exist within a county. In unincorporated areas of the United States these are often arbitrary, except for coinciding with political lines.

Census tracts represent the smallest territorial entity for which population data are available in many countries. In the United States, census tracts are subdivided into block groups and census blocks. In Canada they are divided into dissemination areas. In the U.S., census tracts are &quot;designed to be relatively homogeneous units with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions&quot; and &quot;average about 4,000 inhabitants&quot;.

==By country==
=== Brazil ===
The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics uses the term census sector (&quot;setor censitário&quot;). As of the 2022 Census, there were approximately 452,000 sectors in Brazil.

=== France ===
In 1999 in France, in order to prepare for the dissemination of the 1999 French population census, INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques) developed a system for dividing the country into units of equal size, known as IRIS2000, but now known simply as &#x27;IRIS&#x27;. The acronym stands for &#x27;Ilots Regroupés pour l&#x27;Information Statistique&#x27; (‘aggregated units for statistical information&#x27;) and the 2000 in the name referred not only to the upcoming millennium year but to the target size of 2,000 residents per basic unit. Since 1999, IRIS has represented the fundamental unit for dissemination of infra-municipal data in France and its overseas departments and regions. Towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants, and a large proportion of towns with between 5,000 and 10,000 inhabitants, are divided into several IRIS units. France is composed of around 16,100 IRIS in total, of which 650 are in the overseas departments. There are 3 types of IRIS unit in use: residential IRIS (pop. between 1,800 and 5,000), business IRIS (containing more than 1,000 employees) and miscellaneous IRIS (specific large zones which are sparsely inhabited and have large surface areas (leisure parks, ports, forests etc.).

=== Ireland ===
In the Republic of Ireland, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), established in 1949, organises the census. Beginning from the 2011 census, the CSO website has made available &quot;Small Area Population Statistics&quot; (SAPS) for each &quot;small area&quot;, a subdivision of an electoral division (ED) defined by Ordnance Survey Ireland constrained by natural landscape features. Formerly main roads also constrained the borders but this was changed to increase data privacy. A small area has a minimum of 65 and average of 90 households. For the 2016 census there were 18,641 small areas. The 2016 census also provides the population of each of 50,117 townlands, except those with a population of one sex or two people.

From 1926 to 2006, the smallest unit of public reporting was the electoral division (till 1996 called &quot;district electoral divisions&quot; in counties or &quot;wards&quot; in the cities). There were 3,409 EDs in 2016. Until 1911, the smallest reported unit was the townland in rural areas and the ward in urban areas. Subsequently, townland data was available on application to the CSO. All of the aforementioned are legally defined administrative units, although with no local government functions. From 1996 to 2006, &quot;census enumeration areas&quot; were included in data made available on request for areas within the five county boroughs but not the 29 administrative counties. A census enumeration area was the area covered by a single enumerator, and had an average of 330 households. This data has since been published online.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand census tracts are known as meshblocks, or mesh blocks, and are defined by Statistics New Zealand as being &quot;the smallest geographic unit for which statistical data is collected and processed by Statistics New Zealand&quot;. It is a defined area, varying in size from part of a city block to large areas of rural land. Each of these borders another to form a network covering the whole country including inlets and coasts, and extending out to the 200 mile economic zone. Meshblocks are added together to &quot;build up&quot; larger geographic areas such as area units and urban areas. They are also used to draw up and define New Zealand electorates and local authority boundaries.

===United Kingdom===

British census tracts were first developed in the city of Oxford. The Inter-University Census Tract Committee was formed in 1955 and Oxford was divided into 48 tracts with an average population of 2,645 each. The Registrar General, however, opted for enumeration districts containing less than 1,000 people on average, rather than adopting census tracts. While tracts composed of enumeration districts were later developed, these were not extensively used. Census tracts have, however, been constructed and used by British demographers. The Office for National Statistics now uses enumeration districts only for the collection of data, with output areas used as the base unit in census releases.

===United States===
The concept of the census tract was first developed in the United States. In 1906, Walter Laidlaw originated the concept of permanent, small geographic areas as a framework for studying change from one decennial United States Census to another in neighborhoods within New York City. For the 1910 Census, eight cities—New York, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis—delineated census tracts (then termed ‘‘districts’’) for the first time. No additional jurisdictions delineated census tracts until just prior to the 1930 Census, when an additional ten cities chose to do so. The increased interest in census tracts for the 1930 Census is attributed to the promotional efforts of Howard Whipple Green, who was a statistician in Cleveland, Ohio, and later the chairman of the American Statistical Association&#x27;s Committee on Census Enumeration Areas. For more than 25 years, Green strongly encouraged local citizens, via committees, to establish census tracts and other census statistical geographic areas. The committees created by local citizens were known as Census Tract Committees, later called Census Statistical Areas Committees.
After 1930, the Census Bureau saw the need to standardize the delineation, review, and updating of census tracts and published the first set of census tract criteria in 1934. The goal of the
criteria has remained unchanged; that is, to assure comparability and data reliability through the standardization of the population thresholds for census tracts, as well as requiring that their
boundaries follow specific types of geographic features that do not change frequently. The Census Bureau began publishing census tract data as part of its standard tabulations beginning with
the 1940 Census. Prior to that time, census tract data were published as special tabulations.

For the 1940 Census, the Census Bureau began publishing census block data for all cities with 50,000 or more people. Census block numbers were assigned, where possible, by census
tract, but for those cities that had not yet delineated census tracts, ‘‘block areas’’ (called ‘‘block numbering areas’’ [BNAs] in later censuses) were created to assign census block numbers.
Starting with the 1960 Census, the Census Bureau assumed a greater role in promoting and coordinating the delineation, review, and update of census tracts. For the 1980 Census, criteria for BNAs were changed to make them more comparable in size and shape to census tracts. For the 1990 Census, all counties contained either census tracts or BNAs.

Census 2000 was the first decade in which census tracts were defined in all counties. In addition, the Census Bureau increased the number of geographic areas whose boundaries could be used as census tract boundaries. It also allowed tribal governments of federally recognized American Indian tribes with a reservation and/or off-reservation trust lands to delineate tracts without regard to State and/or county boundaries, provided the tribe had a 1990 Census population of at least 1,000.

Census tracts are also used by the Small Business Administration to define boundaries of HUBZones.

<doc id="105256" wikidata="Q4401253" url="?curid=105256" title="Purpure">
<text>In heraldry, purpure () is a tincture, equivalent to the colour purple, and is one of the five main or most usually used &quot;colours&quot; (as opposed to &quot;metals&quot;). It may be portrayed in engravings by a series of parallel lines at a 45-degree angle running from upper right to lower left from the point of view of an observer, or else indicated by the abbreviation purp.
Purpure has existed since the earliest periods, for example in the purpure lion of the arms of León; at that time, it was painted in a greyer shade. However, it has never been as common as the other colours, and this has led to some controversy as to whether it should be counted among the common colours. In French heraldry, the colour is usually excluded from the common colours as well as considered &quot;ambiguous&quot; (could be either &quot;colour&quot; or &quot;metal&quot;), and Finnish heraldry restricts its use to certain additaments.

There is at least one instance of it being blazoned as &quot;Imperial Purple&quot;. One of the most expensive colours to acquire in ancient times, Tyrian purple was used in the war banner of Byzantine Emperor Komnenos: Purpur (porphyr red) a double-headed eagle displayed Or.

==Poetic meanings==
The different tinctures are traditionally associated with particular heavenly bodies, precious stones, virtues, and flowers, although these associations have been mostly disregarded by serious heraldists. Purpure is associated with:
* Of jewels, the amethyst
* Of heavenly bodies, Mercury (however, Western alchemy associates the amethyst with Jupiter). The planet Mercury is further associated with the element mercury or &quot;quicksilver&quot; in traditional alchemical/occultistic lore.
* Of virtues, temperance

<text>Blayne Nutron Weaver (born April 9, 1976) is an American actor, and filmmaker. He is best known for voicing Peter Pan in &quot;Return to Never Land&quot; (2002) following Bobby Driscoll&#x27;s death in 1968.

==Early life==
Weaver was born in Bossier City, Louisiana on April 9, 1976.

==Career==
Weaver began to perform in the children&#x27;s theater group The Peter Pan Players in Shreveport, Louisiana. His first major film performance was in the independent film &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;. In the late 1990s, he appeared in several TV movies and was also a guest star on several shows including &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, and &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. In 2001, he became the new voice of Disney&#x27;s Peter Pan, and has performed that voice in various children&#x27;s films as well as in recordings for the Disney theme parks.

In 2001, Weaver co-wrote the film &quot;Manic&quot;, which starred actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He continues to play the voice of Peter Pan and pursue acting in Los Angeles. In late 2004, he directed, wrote and starred in the short film &quot;Losing Lois Lane&quot;, which made a big impact online. He then wrote, directed and starred in Secret Identity Productions&#x27; (SIP) first feature film &quot;Outside Sales&quot;, which won awards on the film festival circuit and was released nationwide through Echo Bridge Entertainment. Weaver wrote, directed and played a small role in SIP&#x27;s next feature, &quot;Weather Girl&quot;, with an ensemble cast that boasted Tricia O&#x27;Kelley, Mark Harmon, Jon Cryer and Jane Lynch. &quot;Weather Girl&quot; enjoyed an extensive festival run followed by a ten-city theatrical and a worldwide television and DVD release. Weaver wrote, directed and stars in his next feature film &quot;6 Month Rule&quot; with a cast featuring Martin Starr, Jaime Pressly, John Michael Higgins and Dave Foley.

In 2016, Weaver wrote and directed &quot;Cut to the Chase&quot;, a feature film he also starred in about an ex-con that sets out in search of his kidnapped sister through the criminal underbelly of Shreveport, Louisiana. He also starred in the feature film &quot;Where We&#x27;re Meant to Be&quot; by Michael Howard that deals with the interconnected stories of various characters during the pivotal changes and moments in their lives. His performance earned him a Best Actor nomination at the Eastern NC Film Festival.

In 2019, Weaver directed the Netflix original movie &quot;Santa Girl&quot;. The movie is about Santa&#x27;s daughter, Cassandra &quot;Cassie&quot; Claus, (played by Jennifer Stone) wanting to find herself and see the world despite the wishes of her father (played by Barry Bostwick) who wants her to take over the family business. It first premiered at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Winchester, Virginia.

In 2020, Weaver co-wrote American Pie Presents: Girls&#x27; Rules with David H. Steinberg.

<text>The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS; , ONUSIDA) is the main advocate for accelerated, comprehensive and coordinated global action on the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

The mission of UNAIDS is to lead, strengthen and support an expanded response to HIV and AIDS that includes preventing transmission of HIV, providing care and support to those already living with the virus, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV and alleviating the impact of the epidemic. UNAIDS seeks to prevent the HIV/AIDS epidemic from becoming a severe pandemic.

UNAIDS is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, where it shares some site facilities with the World Health Organization. It is a member of the United Nations Development Group. Currently, Winnie Byanyima leads UNAIDS as executive director. Former executive directors are Peter Piot (1995–2008) and Michel Sidibé (2009–2019).

UNAIDS regularly publishes articles and reports on the status of the AIDS epidemic, including roadmaps to ending HIV as a public health threat and updates on the current scientific findings on vaccines and treatments for HIV infections and AIDS.

The agency promotes the GIPA principle (greater involvement of people living with HIV) formulated in 1994, and endorsed by the United Nations in 2001 and 2006.

==Goals==
# Leadership and advocacy for effective action on the pandemic;
# Strategic information and technical support to guide efforts against AIDS worldwide;
# Tracking, monitoring and evaluation of the pandemic and of responses to it;
# Civil society engagement and the development of strategic partnerships;
# Mobilization of resources to support an effective response.

==Role==
The aim of UNAIDS is to help mount and support an expanded response to HIV/AIDS, one that engages the efforts of many sectors and partners from government and civil society.

Established by ECOSOC resolution 1994/24 on 26 July 1994, UNAIDS officially launched in January 1996. The organization is guided by a Programme Coordinating Board with representatives of 22 governments from all geographic regions, the UNAIDS Cosponsors, and five representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including associations of people living with HIV/AIDS.

==History==

While UN AIDS was officially created in 1994 with UN resolution, and launched in 1996, the roots of UN AIDS can be traced back to the first recorded case of HIV/AIDS 15 years prior in 1981, and the launch of the Global Network of People living with HIV/AIDS (&quot;GNP+&quot;) started in 1986 by Dietmar Bolle, an HIV positive specialist nurse and activist, who aimed to connect people living with HIV/AIDS around the world.

=== Origin: 1920s–1980 and Pre-HIV/AIDS Crisis ===
It is widely believed that HIV first crossed over from chimpanzees to humans in the 1920s through humans eating chimps infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a virus similar to HIV, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Scientific and medical research determined the chimps hunt and eat two smaller monkey species red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys which carried two strains of SIV which combined through infection and transmission into &quot;SIVcpz&quot;, a virus almost identical to HIV, which eventually spread to humans.

The first &quot;verified&quot; case of HIV was detected retrospectively using a blood sample from 1959 from a man living in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, albeit there are believed to be numerous other HIV cases prior based on observed symptoms and patterns of death.

=== 1981 First AIDS Cases Reported ===
The first ever AIDS cases were reported on 5 June 1981 in the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#x27;s weekly epidemiological digest &quot;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly&quot;, which described rare pneumonia in five patients and &quot;the possibility of a cellular-immune dysfunction related to a common exposure that predisposes individuals to opportunistic infections such as pneumocystosis and candidiasis&quot;. In 1982, the CDC adopted the term AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. From 1981 to 1985, doctors around the world in countries such as Belgium and France, and African countries, Zaire, Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia noted they had observed and treated medical cases with similar symptoms as HIV/AIDS in the 1970s. In 1985, the CDC hosted the First International Conference on AIDS in Atlanta.

=== 1981–1994: The Global Response Prior to UNAIDS ===
As Lindsay Knight summarises the understanding and outlook of the early 1980s in her report, &quot;UNAIDS: The first ten years, 1996–2006&quot;: &quot;No one could have imagined that a few cases of rare diseases damaging the immune system would herald a pandemic that has killed more than all those who died in battle during the whole of the twentieth century.&quot; However, views with respect to the speed and success of the initial response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and crisis are mixed.

The global response to the HIV/AIDS crisis was initially led by the US based Center for Disease Control which discovered the first HIV/AIDS case. A 2011 report &quot;AIDS: the Early Years and the CDC&#x27;s Response&quot;, makes the case that it is due to the CDC&#x27;s rapid and effective approach, and staff, that the virus was even discovered in the first place. The report further argues that the CDC&#x27;s approach, along with partnerships with the US Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health, are the reason that initial recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and containment were developed, issued and disseminated so quickly (within 1–2 years of first reported case), The report states that the CDC&#x27;s &quot;excellent surveillance, rapid identification, innovative science, committed persons&quot;, among other factors help to &quot;illustrate the power of epidemiologic investigation in understanding and preventing new diseases, even in the absence of an identified cause&quot; and that the &quot;CDC&#x27;s reputation and staff accomplishments led to the formation of the Global AIDS program.&quot;

Critics of the global response to the HIV/AIDS crisis prior to UNAIDS assert that the initial response was slow, faltering, negligent, and exacerbated the crisis which could have been contained more expeditiously if it were not for failures of leadership, missed opportunities, wasted time, among other factors. One book which examines the global response, and describes both the positive and negative aspects states that during the first fifteen years of the HIV/AIDS crisis, &quot;most of the world&#x27;s leaders, in all sectors of society, displayed a staggering indifference to the growing challenge of this new epidemic.&quot; It explains that a combination of factors – (1) biases and stereotyped views that those ill were only from stigmatized communities such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, drug users, migrants, among others, as well as (2) political issues such as countries not wanting to admit there was a crisis and taking steps to block journalists and media reports on the breakout, (3) politicians falsely believing that the disease was limited to lower income countries with less developed medical and healthcare systems, and some politicians fear of associating their own country with sex and death – all led to a slow response, and low levels of funding for research, treatment, and support at a time when greater actions could have been taken. Other reasons for delays include some scientists dismissing concerns about HIV/AIDS becoming a global pandemic as unnecessarily alarmist.

===Sexual harassment scandal===
Sidibé offered his resignation from his post as head of UNAIDS following an expert report on sexual harassment in the agency that criticized his &quot;defective leadership&quot;. Initially, when allegations surfaced in mid-2018, Sidibe refused to quit. In response to heightened scrutiny and reports of his gross mismanagement, however, Sidibe informed the agency&#x27;s board on 13 December 2018 that he would leave his post in June 2019.

A panel of independent experts released a report on 13 December 2018 saying Sidibe was overseeing a &quot;patriarchal&quot; workplace and promoting a &quot;cult of personality&quot; centred on him as the all-powerful chief. The experts further said the situation could not be changed unless Sidibe, a native of Mali who has headed the UN agency for nine years, resigned.

One official with ties to senior management at the UNAIDS Geneva secretariat also noted, under Sidibe&#x27;s leadership, that &quot;UNAids mirrors the whole UN as a &#x27;boys club&#x27; with hierarchical and patriarchal culture of discrimination, lack of transparency and accountability that enables harassment.&quot;

Sidibe denied claims that he tried to force an employee to drop allegations that she was sexually assaulted by his former deputy. Despite the scathing report, he insisted he was the right man to turn around the organisation, a claim which had been roundly rejected.

==Staff, Sponsors and Partners==
===Cosponsors===
* The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
* United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF)
* World Food Programme (WFP)
* United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
* United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
* United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
* International Labour Organization (ILO)
* United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
* World Health Organization (WHO)
* World Bank
* UN Women

The co-sponsors and the UNAIDS Secretariat form the Committee of Cosponsoring Organizations, which meets twice each year.

===Leadership===
The executive director of UNAIDS is Winnie Byanyima, who assumed the role on 1 November 2019. Peter Piot was the first executive director of UNAIDS. He served from its inception in 1995 until 2008, when he departed to lead the Institute for Global Health at Imperial College London. On 1 January 2009, Michel Sidibé became the new executive director of UNAIDS until 2019 when he was appointed as Minister of Health and Social Affairs of Mali. Following Mr Sidibé&#x27;s departure and until the appointment of Ms Byanyima, Gunilla Carlsson, the Deputy Executive Director, Management and Governance, was appointed as UNAIDS Executive Director, ad interim. Shannon Hader is the Deputy Executive Director, Programme.

===Partnerships===
The United Nations Declaration Commitment on HIV/AIDS provides the guiding framework for UNAIDS action. Promoting partnerships among various stakeholders is reflected within the leadership section of the Declaration of Commitment. In particular, it calls for complementation of government efforts by the full and active participation of civil society, the business community and the private sector through:
* Establishing and strengthening mechanisms that involve civil society including faith-based organizations (FBOs), the private sector, and people living with HIV/AIDS at all levels
* Encouraging and supporting local and national organizations to expand and strengthen regional partnerships, coalitions and networks
* Full participation of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), those in vulnerable groups and people mostly at risk, particularly young people
* Addressing issue of stigma and discrimination.

UNAIDS works to promote partnerships among and between this diverse and broad range of non-state entities. This calls for increases in both the number of new actors, as well as in innovative ways of working, to facilitate increased capacity of non-state entities to respond effectively to the epidemic at all levels.

With the momentum generated by the UN Special Session on HIV/AIDS, the main challenges are to:
* Sustain and deepen involvement of those contributing and critical to the response such as PLWHA organizations
* Move beyond the organizations already involved and reach out to optimally engage a broad range of sectors/actors.

UNAIDS has collaborated with the Roman Catholic Church, especially Caritas Internationalis, in the fight against AIDS, something which materialized in a December 2005 message by Pope Benedict XVI. However, it indicated in a 2009 communiqué that it did not agree with the Pope&#x27;s statement that condoms were unhelpful in AIDS prevention, instead calling them &quot;essential&quot;.

====From policy to action====
In engaging non-state entities in an expanded response to the epidemic, the UNAIDS Secretariat:
* Fosters and supports global, regional and country level partnerships which include linkages between and among civil society, private sector, philanthropy, media, and with particular attention to organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS
* Supports governments and UN agencies in developing partnerships with non-state entities. This includes support for approaches intended to increase participation, improve connectedness of efforts and strengthen the various participants&#x27; capacity for action.

===Donors===
As the main advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS leads, strengthens and supports an expanded response aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV, providing care and support, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV/AIDS, and alleviating the impact of the epidemic. To fulfil this mandate, UNAIDS is supported by voluntary contributions from governments, foundations, corporations, private groups (for example, students, universities, sporting clubs, etc.) and individuals.

In 2003, more than US$118.5 million was received from 30 governments, philanthropic organizations, individuals from around the world and others. The largest donors were the Netherlands followed by Norway, the United States, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Japan. In 2004, 35 governments contributed to UNAIDS including India.

In 2020 UNAIDS received US$ 247.2 million in 2020, in voluntary donations. In 2021, US$ 171.4 million in core funding was made available by twenty-seven governments, with the US leading donating $45,000,000, followed by Sweden and the Netherlands. In addition, In 2021, non-core resources amounting to US$ 75.9 million were made available to UNAIDS, led by the US, with $53,807,294, followed by the UNFPA and Russia.

<text>Mekoryuk (Nunivak Cup&#x27;ig: &quot;Mikuryarmiut&quot;; Central Yup&#x27;ik: &quot;Mikuryar&quot;) is a city located on Nunivak Island in the Bethel Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 191, down from 210 in 2000.

==History==
Nunivak Island has been inhabited for 2,000 years by the Nuniwarmiut, or Nunivak Cup&#x27;ig people.

The community&#x27;s first contact with Europeans was in 1821 when explorers from the Russian-American Company arrived on their island. These Russians recorded 400 people living in 16 villages on the Nunivak Island.

While conducting the 1880 United States Census, Ivan Petrof recorded 702 Yup&#x27;ik in 9 villages, including 117 people at &quot;Koot&quot;, near the site of present-day Mekoryuk. An epidemic in 1900 left only four surviving families in the village.

In the 1930s, the Evangelical Covenant Church was built at Mekoryuk, followed by a school in 1939. People moved to the village from other areas of the island to be near the school. Reindeer herding was introduced in 1920 by an Eskimo-Russian trader. The operation was purchased by the United States government in the 1940s and a slaughterhouse was built in 1945. The reindeer were crossed with caribou from Denali Park. The resulting animals were larger and less tame than other reindeer. 34 musk ox from Greenland were transferred to the Nunivak Island in 1934 in an effort to save the species from extinction. Today, the musk-ox herd numbers around 500, and calves from this herd have been relocated and introduced to other areas of Alaska.

In the mid-20th century, Mekoryuk became the only permanent population center on the island. Until the 1940s, the traditional lifestyle and traditional ceremonies and religious beliefs were practiced.

The 1950s and 1960s brought considerable change. Mekoryuk Airport was built in 1957. When the Territorial Guard was formed, men were sent to Fort Richardson near Anchorage for training.

<text>Newtok () is a small village on the Ningliq River in the Bethel Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census, the population was 354, up from 321 in 2000. Climate change is forcing the primarily Central Yup&#x27;ik Alaska Native village to consider relocation. Mertarvik is the destination of those leaving the village.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (7.21%) is water.

==Demographics==
Newtok first appeared on the 1950 U.S. Census as &quot;Keyaluvik&quot;, an unincorporated native village. This was also the name of the earlier settlement just to the west, which became known as &quot;Old Keyaluvik.&quot; In 1960, the name was changed to Newtok. Newtok formally incorporated in 1976, but disincorporated in 1997. It was then made a census-designated place (CDP), effective with the 2000 census.
As of the census of 2000, there were 321 people, 63 households, and 51 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 67 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 3.12% White, 95.33% Native American, and 1.56% from two or more races.

There were 63 households, out of which 68.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.5% were married couples living together, 11.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.0% were non-families. 19.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 5.10 and the average family size was 5.96.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 45.2% under the age of 18, 10.0% from 18 to 24, 26.8% from 25 to 44, 14.3% from 45 to 64, and 3.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 21 years. For every 100 females, there were 118.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 112.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $32,188, and the median income for a family was $32,188. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $15,625 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $9,514. About 29.8% of families and 31.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 38.9% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Environmental issues==

In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that erosion made Newtok an island between the widening Ningliq River and a slough to the north, because Alaskan permafrost is melting due to climate change. Coastal storms and thawing permafrost have worn away the land upon which Newtok was built. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; article, because the village is below sea-level and sinking, the town could be washed away within a decade.

Erosion of the tundra by the river has destroyed much of the area of the village, including the barge dock. The United States Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; March 2009 report estimates the highest point in the town, the high school, will be under water by the year 2017.

The town was featured in the 2009 History Channel&#x27;s TV show, &quot;Tougher in Alaska,&quot; in the episode called &quot;Dangerous Earth.&quot;

In 2015, Newtok was one of the two towns featured in the Al Jazeera English &quot;Fault Lines&quot; documentary, &quot;When the Water Took the Land.&quot;

By 2019, the first residents moved to a new town, Mertarvik.

In 2022 Patagonia released a feature length documentary on Newtok.

==Education==
Lower Kuskokwim School District operates the Ayaprun School, K-12. the school has 128 students, 12 teachers, and 27 other employees. Its continuation is the Mertarvik Pioneer School.

==Relocation==

Land has been acquired for a new townsite called Mertarvik on nearby Nelson Island about away, and $1 million in government funding has been obtained to build a dock for delivering building supplies.

As of 2016, although the town&#x27;s roughly 400 residents voted in 2003 to relocate to higher ground nine miles away, progress has been slow.

On December 24, 2016, the village made a disaster declaration request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for disaster assistance due to &quot;flooding, persistent erosion, and permafrost degradation starting on January 1, 2006 and continuing.&quot; The request would &quot;include relocation of the Yupik Tribe (population of ~350 people).&quot;

During the summer of 2018, a 6,000 square-foot community center was built, as were 8 houses. Plans for 2019 include interior work in the community center so it can be used as a school, a generator building, and 13 more houses. Construction of roads, pipes, and a water treatment plant is planned. The goal is to complete relocation by 2023.

In September 2022, Typhoon Merbok caused damage to fuel barrels and moved the ocean shoreline closer to the edge of the town.

In 1926, Walter Smith, an Eskimo, discovered what he thought was &quot;white gold&quot; at the mouth of Fox Gulch, a tributary of Platinum Creek. Samples sent to the United States Bureau of Mines in Fairbanks determined it was actually platinum. In 1928, Charles Thorsen discovered platinum in Clara Creek, while Edward St. Clair discovered platinum in Squirrel Creek. Consolidation of the subsequent mining claims resulted in Goodnews Bay Mining Co. and Clara Creek Mining Co. becoming the major operators mining these placer deposits containing 60 per cent platinum and 22 percent iridium. The largest nugget was found on Squirrel Creek and weighed 1.5 ounces. These placers are found in the drainage east of Red Mountain, which is composed of dunite. However, platinum has not been found on the mountain. Goodnews Bay Mining Co. started operating a dragline excavator on Squirrel Creek on August 11, 1934, and on Platinum Creek and Fox Gulch in 1937. The company started operations with a dredge in Nov. 1937. The Clara Creek Mining Co. started mining operations on Clara Creek in 1936. A total of 3000 ounces of platinum metals were recovered from all mining operations between 1927 and 1934, and 18,000 ounces between 1934 and 1937.

<text>Upper Kalskag () is a city in Bethel Census Area, Alaska, United States. It is thirty miles west of Aniak. At the 2010 census the population was 210, down from 230 in 2000.

== Culture and history ==
Upper Kalskag is a traditional Yup&#x27;ik village, with a culture centered on subsistence activities. The founding residents were from the native village of Kaltkhagamute, four miles down river. The Russian explorer Lavrenty Zagoskin reported a population of 120 in 1843 for Kaltkhagamute (Khalkagmute). Over the years, residents of Crow Village, Ohagamiut, Russian Mission, and Paimute also moved to the village. Russian and American explorers brought both Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox religious influences, but the village&#x27;s Russian Orthodox practitioners left to establish Lower Kalskag 2 miles downriver in 1940. George Morgan, a German immigrant who founded Georgetown, established a general store and post office in 1932. Paul N. Kameroff Sr. also established a general store, a pool hall, and a coffee shop around 1930. The government school was built in that timeframe as well. The community once owned a herd of about 2000 caribou.

<text>King Salmon is a census-designated place (CDP) in Bristol Bay Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is southwest of Anchorage. As of the 2020 census the population was 307, down from 374 in 2010. It is home to Katmai National Park and Preserve. 
King Salmon is the borough seat of neighboring Lake and Peninsula Borough, but does not serve that purpose in its own borough, whose borough seat is in Naknek.

==Geography==

King Salmon is on the north bank of the Naknek River on the Alaska Peninsula, about upriver from Naknek, near Naknek Lake. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of , of which, is land and (0.82%) is water.

===Climate===

King Salmon has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) even though it is at 58° North. Temperatures, especially extreme ones, are much less moderate than in the subpolar oceanic climate of the Pacific Ocean side of the Alaska Peninsula; however, average temperatures in winter are still milder than some locations in the coterminous United States, such as Fargo, North Dakota. The town lies just below the southern limit of sporadic permafrost in Alaska, and is strongly sheltered from the extremely wet Aleutian Low which drops most of its moisture on the opposite (eastern) side of the mountains. It is a lot colder than fellow west-coast climates of Europe on the same latitude due to the influence of the Siberian High on Bering Sea surface temperatures. In summer, King Salmon catches up to similar latitudes in the British Isles, where the difference is much stronger in winter. The area remains quite a bit colder year round than around the Baltic Sea in a similar west-facing location.

The warmest temperature recorded is in July 2019 and the coldest is in January 1989. Winter days are sometimes very cold due to winds from the interior during cold waves. The coldest daily maximum measured was , also in January 1989. During the 1991–2020 normals, the coldest daily maximum averaged . Warm summer nights are a rarity, although was recorded in August 1919. The warmest low in a regular year averages a modest .

==Parks==
*Katmai National Park and Preserve

== History ==
In the 1930s, the U.S. government built an air navigation silo at the site of present-day King Salmon. At the beginning of World War II, the U.S. Army Air Forces built an air base around the silo. It was maintained by the Civil Aeronautics Administration throughout the war.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a long road from King Salmon to Naknek. Other government agencies, such as the National Park Service, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and the United States Weather Bureau, built facilities at King Salmon. The King Salmon Inn opened in 1956.

King Salmon is now a government, transportation, and service and shipment center for the commercial red salmon and sport fishing industries.

The Air Force base closed in 1994, and is kept in caretaker status (mothballed) by Anchorage-based Chugach Federal Solutions, Inc. King Salmon Airport is now a public access airport.

King Salmon is one of the sites of Super Dual Auroral Radar Network.

In 2010, a local National Weather Service employee and his wife were involved in a domestic terrorism plot that had proceeded to the operational phase. A hit list of 20 people that included media and military personnel was found.

The community appeared on Ivan Petroff&#x27;s 1880 Census map as &quot;Kinghiak&quot;, but did not include a separate population. There is confusion as to whether the villages listed on the 1890 census, Pakwik (population 93) and Kinuyak (AKA Kinghiak) (population 51) were on either the south or north side of the river, but credited &quot;Kinuyak&quot; here for Naknek, which also included an unnamed native village on Naknek Lake. In 1900, it returned as Naknek. It did not appear on the 1910 census, but returned again in 1920 and to date. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) as of the 1980 census.

There were 247 households, out of which 44.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.0% were married couples living together, 6.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.4% were non-families. 25.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

==Demographics==

South Naknek first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as one of two unincorporated Inuit villages called &quot;Paugwik.&quot; This apparently also included the future village of Naknek on the north side of the Naknek River. There is confusion as to whether the villages listed on the 1890 census, Pakwik (population 93) and Kinuyak (AKA Kinghiak) (population 51) were on either the south or north side of the river. Not until the 1940 census would South Naknek return again, and (for the first time) under that name. It did not appear in 1950, but returned again in 1960 and in every successive census. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) as of the 1980 census. Within the present boundaries is also the former village of Savonoski, which appeared once on the 1940 census with a population of 20, located east of the village of South Naknek (now a ghost). This is not to be confused with a village of the same name, which was evacuated following the Katmai eruptions of 1912.

As of the census of 2000, there were 137 people, 46 households, and 33 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 137 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 13.14% White, 1.46% Black or African American, 83.94% Native American, 0.73% Asian and 0.73% Pacific Islander. 2.19% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 46 households, out of which 39.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.0% were married couples living together, 10.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.1% were non-families. 15.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.98 and the average family size was 3.32.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 29.9% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 32.1% from 25 to 44, 22.6% from 45 to 64, and 6.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 128.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 128.6 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $22,344, and the median income for a family was $44,375. Males had a median income of $30,625 versus $23,750 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $13,019. There were 16.1% of families and 27.1% of the population living below the poverty line, including 41.7% of under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==Education==
Young residents of South Naknek attend high school at Bristol Bay High School, in Naknek, Alaska. Naknek is located on the opposite side of the river. There is no bridge connecting the two towns, so school-children must be flow across the river and the beginning and the end of the school day. The Bristol Bay School District has provided this service as recently as 2008 for school-children whose &quot;school bus&quot; from South Naknek to Naknek is an airplane.

<text>Anderson is a city in the Denali Borough, Alaska, United States, and the borough&#x27;s only incorporated community. At the 2010 census the population was 246, down from 367 at the 2000 census. At the 2020 census, the population dropped to 177 residents. The city is named after one of the original homesteaders.

==History==

===Early years===
Anderson is named after Arthur Anderson, one of several homesteaders who settled in the area in the late 1950s. In 1959, Anderson subdivided his homestead into house lots and sold most of the lots to civilian workers from Clear Air Force Station, a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System station completed in 1961. An elementary school was built in the community in 1961, and Anderson incorporated as a city on June 2, 1962.

In the 1960s, a road was completed between Anderson and Nenana. A ferry across the Tanana River at Nenana provided access to the Fairbanks–Nenana Highway, and hence to Fairbanks and the contiguous North American highway system via the Richardson and Alaska Highways. The ferry was replaced with a bridge in 1968. In 1972, the George Parks Highway was completed, which provided direct road access to points south, including Anchorage.

===21st century===
In March 2007, the city announced a plan to attract more residents: the awarding of free land to interested applicants. This concept has been compared to that of the Homestead Act.

The Anderson/Clear Lions Club, in conjunction with commercial sponsors and Two Rivers-based concert promoters Acoustic Adventures, hosted the annual Anderson Bluegrass Festival. Held on the last weekend of every July from Friday through Sunday at Riverside Park, the festival was the city&#x27;s significant visitor attraction. The festival was discontinued in 2012. It was replaced with a similar, privately run family music festival held in the same location starting in 2015.

==Geography==
Anderson is located at (64.345372, -149.195352), abutting the northern border of the Denali Borough. Anderson is north of Healy, south of Nenana and southwest of Fairbanks. The Anderson townsite lies in between the Alaska Railroad mainline and the Nenana River, along the northern edge of city limits. The George Parks Highway ( east of the townsite) and Clear Air Force Station ( south of the townsite) are also within city limits. Clear Air Force Station is home to the 213th Space Warning Squadron. Anderson lies north of Anchorage, the most populous city of Alaska, and southwest of Fairbanks.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.49%, is water.

Anderson attracts mostly curious visitors, owing to its &quot;out of the way&quot; location at the end of a side road, plus those stopping to camp or access the Nenana River at Riverside Park.

<text>Cantwell (&quot;Yidateni Na’&quot; in Ahtna Athabascan) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Denali Borough, Alaska, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the CDP was 200.

Cantwell is the western terminus of the Denali Highway. Once an Alaska Railroad flag stop at the junction with the Denali Highway, it was founded off the Parks Highway.

== History ==
Prior to the western settlement of Cantwell, the only inhabitants of the area were nomadic Ahtna Athabaskans who subsisted off the land. The Ahtna people know Cantwell as &#x27;Yedatene&#x27;na&#x27;. Then Cantwell was renamed after Lieutenant J. C. Cantwell, military explorer and commander of the revenue steamer &quot;Nunivak&quot; on the Yukon River, 1899-1901. The settled town began as a flag stop on the Alaska Railroad. This flagstop supplied the Valdez Creek mining area, which had the name &quot;Denali&quot; for the Valdez Creek community. Many Indians from the village of Tyone came to work at Valdez Creek and later lived out their lives in the Cantwell area. Many Tyones are buried in the old Cantwell graveyard, next to the railroad tracks. Oley Nicklie, a Native Alaskan, sought work with the railroad after fur prices dropped. He and his two brothers then founded part of the settlement. Cantwell is 20 miles away from a giant abandoned igloo shaped hotel, which is not made out of ice.

Cantwell served as a partial filming location for the &quot;Lure of the Yukon&quot; during the 1920s, and for the 2007 movie &quot;Into the Wild&quot;.

==Geography==
Cantwell is located in the southern part of Denali Borough at (63.388000, -148.900204). It is situated at the north end of Broad Pass, along Cantwell Creek and the Jack River, tributaries of the north-flowing Nenana River. Alaska Route 3, the George Parks Highway, passes through Cantwell: Anchorage is to the south, and Fairbanks is to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Cantwell CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.29%, is water.

==Climate==

<text>Healy is a census-designated place (CDP) and the borough seat of Denali Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 966 at the time of the 2020 census, down from 1,021 in 2010.

==History==

The history of Healy is intertwined with that of coal mining and construction of the Alaska Railroad, which both began in the area in 1918 and 1919 respectively.

Healy was originally named Healy Fork after the Healy River. The Healy River was named after John J. Healy, manager of the North American Trading and Transportation Company.

==Geography==
Healy is located at (63.970833, -149.126944). The George Parks Highway (Alaska Route 3) runs through the community, leading south to Denali Park and north to Nenana.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Healy CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.03%, is water. By area, it is the second-largest CDP in the United States, exceeded by only Willow, Alaska.

==Climate==
As is typical of the Alaska Interior, Healy experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with very long, bitterly cold winters and short, warm summers, and straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 2 and 3, indicating the coldest temperature of the year is typically around . Average temperatures are below freezing from early October to mid-April, though occasionally chinook winds will push temperatures up to even in the depths of winter.

== Economy ==
Usibelli Coal Mine, Golden Valley Electric Association, the Denali Borough School District, and the National Park Service are the major employers in Healy. Proximity to Denali National Park &amp; Preserve supports local RV parks, hotels, restaurants, bed and breakfast, and other small businesses. The Denali Chamber of Commerce represents the economic interests of Healy and the Denali Borough, Alaska. The 24 MW Eva Creek Wind Farm opened in 2013, 12 miles north of Healy.

==Demographics==
Healy first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as the unincorporated community of &quot;Healey Fork.&quot; In 1940, it appeared as Healy Fork. It was shortened to *Healy beginning in 1950. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980.

*Note there was also another locale named &quot;Healey (Healy) Village&quot; on the 1930 &amp; 1940 U.S. Censuses (with a population of 16 and 77, respectively). It was stated that this place was located in the Fairbanks Recording District rather than Nenana (where then Healy Fork was located). It is unclear whether this was a geographic error on the census and both places were located at or around Healy Fork and merged in 1950, or if the former was a native village on or near present-day Healy Lake (within Southeast Fairbanks Census Area).

At the 2000 census there were 1,000 people, 436 households, and 245 families in the CDP. The population density was . There were 604 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 90.20% White, 0.30% Black or African American, 2.30% Native American, 1.90% Asian, 0.70% Pacific Islander, 0.80% from other races, and 3.80% from two or more races. 2.00%. were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 436 households 33.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.4% were married couples living together, 3.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.6% were non-families. 37.6% of households were one person and 0.9% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.29 and the average family size was 3.12.

The age distribution was 27.4% under the age of 18, 5.5% from 18 to 24, 34.3% from 25 to 44, 30.6% from 45 to 64, and 2.2% 65 or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 132.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 142.8 males.

The median household income was $60,000 and the median family income was $77,806. Males had a median income of $65,729 versus $30,227 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $28,225. About 2.5% of families and 4.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.9% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
K-12 students attend Tri-Valley School, operated by the Denali Borough School District. The district is headquartered in Healy.

== Stampede Trail Bus ==
Just outside of Healy, (Approximately 6 miles) near the Stampede Trail, is the former location of the bus that Christopher McCandless occupied during his &quot;Great Alaskan Adventure&quot;. Fairbanks City Transit bus 142 drew others into the same wilderness, and seeking it out has ultimately lead to the deaths of two people. The bus has since been airlifted and transported to the University of Alaska Museum of the North (Antonette, 2021)

<text>Maresme () is a &quot;comarca&quot; (county) in the Barcelona region in Catalonia, located along the Mediterranean coast, between the &quot;comarques&quot; of Barcelonès (at the Southwest) and Selva (at the Northeast), and also bordering with Vallès Oriental (at the west).

Its capital and largest city is Mataró (pop. 119,035 in 2007).

==Geography==
Maresme occupies a long and narrow area between the Mediterranean Sea and the hills of Serralada Litoral (Catalonia&#x27;s coastal mountains), and specifically Montnegre&#x27;s and &#x27;s hills in the northern half and Sant Mateu&#x27;s hills in the southern half. This particular shape has conditioned both the geography and the history of this &quot;comarca&quot;. Probably the main distinct elements of its geography are the characteristic &quot;rieres&quot; (torrents). These short, intermittent streams, which cross the &quot;comarca&quot; transversally about every hundred meters, produce powerful and dangerous floods when it rains.

Maresme has been historically very well connected with the rest of the &quot;comarca&quot; as well as with Barcelona by the old &quot;Camí Ral&quot; (Royal Way) (current N-II main road) and railroad (The Barcelona–Mataró railroad route, finished in 1848, was the first ever in all the Iberian Peninsula). Communications were enhanced in recent years with the construction of the C-32&#x27;s Barcelona–Mataró section (1969), which was the first &quot;autopista&quot; (highway) ever in Spain, and its subsequent enlargement, the Mataró-Palafolls&#x27;s section (1995).

<text>Aleknagik ( ; ) is a second class city in the Dillingham Census Area of the Unorganized Borough of the U.S. state of Alaska. The population was 219 at the 2010 census, down from 221 in 2000.

==Geography==
Aleknagik is located at (59.278362, -158.622928) (Sec. 31, T010S, R055W, Seward Meridian), in the Bristol Bay Recording District.

Aleknagik is located at the head of the Wood River on the southeast end of Lake Aleknagik, northwest of Dillingham. The city is named after Aleknagik Lake.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 40.89%, is water.

== Climate ==
Aleknagik&#x27;s climate is similar to that of nearby Anchorage and Dillingham, having a typical subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfc). Fog and low clouds are common during July and August, and may preclude access. The lake and river are ice-free from June through mid-November. A weather station was operated between 1958 and 1973; however the climate data has many missing observations and appears slightly irregular, with March in many years being colder than February. The smoothed data, however, shows March slightly warmer:

==History and culture==
Wood River and Aleknagik Lake have been used historically as summer fish camps. The spelling of the Yupik word &quot;Aleknagik&quot; has been disputed, because Yupik was an unwritten language. The name was described by the resident Yako family in 1930 as meaning &quot;Wrong Way Home&quot;, because Nushagak River residents returning to their homes upriver would sometimes become lost in the fog and find themselves swept up the Wood River with the tide, inadvertently arriving at Aleknagik Lake.

Recorded history may not define the exact place of Aleknagik, and various reports have reported the original site with the name &quot;Alaqnaqiq&quot; as far to the south near entrance to the Wood River. James Van Stone, an anthropologist who traveled to Saint Petersburg and read diaries of the Russian explorers from 1867, noted that explorers traveled to &quot;Aleknagik Lake&quot; (in a spelling that is Russian but sounds out to Aleknagik).

In 2005, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources applied to own the waterways and compiled an extensive history of the area in their application (see Links below).

The 1929 U.S. Census found 55 people living in the &quot;Wood River village&quot; area to the south. During 1930, there were five families living on the shores of the lake year-round, the Waskeys, Polleys, Hansons, Yakos, and Smiths. A log cabin territorial school was built on the south shore of the lake in 1933, and Josie Waskey was the first teacher. Attracted by the school, other facilities, and plentiful fish, game and timber, a number of families from the Goodnews, Togiak, and Kulukak areas relocated to Aleknagik. A post office was established in March 1937, with Mrs Mabel M. Smith as postmaster. A two-story framed school with a teacher apartment was constructed in 1938. By 1939, Aleknagik had 78 residents, over 30 buildings, and a small sawmill. In the late 1940s, a Seventh-day Adventist mission and school were established on the north shore. During the 1950s, a Moravian church and a Russian Orthodox church were built in Aleknagik, and over 35 families lived along the lake. In 1959, the state constructed a road connecting the south shore to Dillingham. The road was passable only during the summer months, until the late 1980s when it was upgraded and maintained year-round. The city was incorporated in 1973. Over 24 additional square miles were annexed to the city in April 2000.

In the mid-1950s, Moravian church members formed a colony on the north shore of the lake, across from the post office. The Moravian pastor and his wife&#x27;s family built homes there and remain in the community.

In the late 19th century there were about 200 people in Aleknagik and the other Wood River villages. Varied illnesses killed most of the residents of the villages. The few survivors moved out of the area. In fall of 1930, there was one Yupik family living at the top of the Wood River in Aleknagik, and the village grew to about 40 people by 1931. By 1940, Aleknagik had over 30 buildings, including a community school, church, and small sawmill. The local religious mission school, run by Seventh-day Adventists, brought several new families to Aleknagik. Other families came to the village because of the territorial school.

In 1938, a territorial school was constructed in Aleknagik. During this period, a Moravian church, a Russian Orthodox church and a Seventh-day Adventist mission school were established in the community. In 1959, the State of Alaska constructed a road connecting Aleknagik to Dillingham.

The Aleknagik Traditional Council, a federally-recognized tribe, is located in the community.

In August 2010, an airplane carrying former Senator Ted Stevens crashed near Alegnagik, resulting in the death of Stevens and four others.

==Demographics==

Aleknagik first appeared on 1940 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It appeared as Aleknagik Lake (uninc.) on the 1960 census, and neighboring village of Aleknagik Mission showed 50 residents (for a combined total area of 231). In 1970, it appeared again simply as Aleknagik and was incorporated in 1973.

About 21.7% of families and 40.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 49.0% of those under the age of eighteen and 21.4% of those 65 or over.

==Public services==
The majority of residents (49 homes) have household plumbing, and most use individual wells. 12 homes do not have water or sewer service – some haul water from the community center, and a few are served by a spring water catchment system. Septic tanks, leachate fields and public sewage lagoons are used for sewage disposal. The North Shore uses eleven shared residential effluent pumps (REP units) which discharge into a piped system. There are three landfill sites. The North Shore landfill is being relocated; the South Shore landfill has an incinerator but is unfenced. A third landfill is located from the South Shore, on the West side of the Aleknagik-Dillingham road. Electricity is provided by Nushugak Electric Cooperative. Local hospitals or health clinics include North Shore Health Clinic (842–5512), South Shore Health Clinic (842–2185) or Kanakanak Hospital in Dillingham. Both, North and South Shore Clinics are Primary Health Care facilities. Aleknagik is classified as a highway village, it is found in EMS Region 2I in the Bristol Bay Region. Emergency Services have limited highway, air and satellite access. Emergency service is provided by volunteers and a health aide Auxiliary health care is provided by Aleknagik First Responders Group (907-842-2085); or Kanakanak Hospital in Dillingham (25 road miles).

There is one school located in the community, Aleknagik School, operated by the Southwest Region School District. It is attended by 26 students.

In 2021, Aleknagik became a part of the Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project via the Renewable Energy Alaska Project; the project will help the city (and several other remote villages in Alaska) develop renewable energy sources and increase its energy efficiency.

==Economy and transportation==
Many residents participate in commercial and subsistence activities on the Bristol Bay coast during the summer. 33 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Trapping is also an important means of income. Most families depend to some extent on subsistence activities to supplement their livelihoods. Salmon, freshwater fish, moose, caribou, and berries are harvested. Poor fish returns and prices since 1997 have significantly affected the community.

Aleknagik is the only village in the region coming close to a road link with Dillingham; a road connects to the south shore of Aleknagik Lake from which the city is within walking distance. The &quot;New Aleknagik&quot; airport is a State-owned by gravel airstrip located on the north shore, and regular flights are scheduled through Dillingham. The north shore of the lake was not road accessible until fall of 2016 when finally a two lane 440&#x27; bridge was constructed across the Wood River; residents used skiffs to travel to town on the south shore. Moody&#x27;s Aleknagik Seaplane Base, also on the north shore, accommodates float planes. There are two additional airstrips, the public Tripod Airport, a turf-gravel airstrip located southeast of Aleknagik, and the Adventist Mission School Airport, a gravel/dirt airstrip with a crosswind runway. The State owns and operates a dock on the north shore of Aleknagik Lake. A breakwater, barge landing, boat launch ramp and boat lift are available on the north shore. Vehicles, skiffs, ATVs and snowmachines are the most frequent means of local transportation.

Sales tax in the community is 5%, and there is also a 5% accommodations tax. There is no property tax.

<text>Dillingham (), also known as Curyung, is a city in Dillingham Census Area, Alaska, United States. Incorporated in 1963, it is an important commercial fishing port on Nushagak Bay. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,249, down from 2,329 in 2010.

==Geography==
Dillingham is on Nushagak Bay at the mouth of the Nushagak River, an inlet of Bristol Bay, an arm of the Bering Sea in the North Pacific, in southwestern Alaska. It is located at (59.046751, -158.508665).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land, and of it (7.64%) is water. This may change as the City of Dillingham will likely petition the State of Alaska to increase the size of its boundaries to include most of Nushagak Bay and Wood River, to gain revenue from the Nushagak District and Wood River Special Harvest Area commercial salmon fisheries.

Dillingham is located in the 37th district of the Alaska House of Representatives, and is represented by Independent Bryce Edgmon, who serves as Speaker for the Alaska House of Representatives.

==Transportation==
Dillingham is not connected to the statewide road system, thus the only way to reach the city is by air or boat. Dillingham Airport, located near the center of the city limits, has a runway and is served (in the summertime) by several flights daily through Alaska Airlines; year-round flights are available through PenAir. A paved road connects Dillingham with Aleknagik and the Wood-Tikchik State Park. Many residents live along the Aleknagik Lake Road, among other roads, connecting the city&#x27;s center with adjacent neighborhoods, such as Wood River and Kanakanak.

== Natural resources ==
Dillingham is the regional hub of the rich Bristol Bay salmon fishing district. Bristol Bay supports the world&#x27;s largest runs of wild sockeye salmon and returns of other species of Pacific salmon. The Nushagak district produces an average of 6.4 million salmon annually and as many as 12.4 million salmon in 2006. Harvests are closely regulated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to ensure adequate spawning escapement to ensure long term sustainability and provide for subsistence harvests by residents of upriver villages.

Commercial fishing remains an important part of the Dillingham economy, but prices paid for salmon vary due to international competition, especially from fish farming operations in Chile, Norway, Canada and elsewhere. Prices paid Bristol Bay fishermen for fresh sockeye salmon peaked at $2.11 per pound in 1988 but fell to just $0.42 per pound in 2001. Prices have since rebounded due to techniques to improve fish quality and enhanced marketing efforts, and were back up to $2.35 per pound in 2013, rising to $3.02 in 2016 when reporting ceased. Processed fresh sockeye were priced commercially at $6.43 per pound in 2019.

Dillingham is an important gateway to many sport fishing lodges and eco-tourism opportunities. Many of these are focused on the adjacent Wood-Tikchik State Park, the largest state park in the United States, known for its great fishing opportunities. Dillingham is also the headquarters for nearby Togiak National Wildlife Refuge, home to walruses, seals, terrestrial mammals, migratory birds, and fish, as well as one of the largest wild herring fisheries in the world. Togiak National Wildlife Refuge was established to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity, including salmon, to fulfill international treaty obligations, to provide for continued subsistence use, and to ensure necessary water quality and quantity.

In 2010, the City of Dillingham voted to re-authorize its position opposing the proposed Pebble Mine, a large gold-copper-molybdenum prospect located at the headwaters of Bristol Bay. The resolution explains that the value of the fishery totals about $100 million a year; that the commercial wild salmon fishery has been the backbone of livelihoods for more than 100 years; that the future of the renewable resource industry depends on its freshwater stream reputation; that local residents depend on subsistence activities which in turn depend on Bristol Bay&#x27;s pristine freshwater streams and habitat; and that Pebble threatens to destroy the last great wild salmon fishery on the planet.

==Demographics==

Dillingham first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as the unincorporated village of Kanakanak. In 1920, it returned as Chogiung and in 1930 and every successive census as Dillingham. It formally incorporated in 1963. See: Historic Locales &amp; Confusion Over Place Names Around Dillingham

Per-capita crime rates in Dillingham are persistently higher than state and national averages. In 2007, the city experienced the nation&#x27;s highest rate of forcible rape per person, with 1 incident for every 103.9 residents. The city ranked 22nd (out of 8,659 cities with available data) for overall violent crime, with 1 incident for every 32.8 residents.

== History ==

Dillingham and its surrounding areas were inhabited by the Yup&#x27;ik people for millennia, who lived off of the land and sea. British Navy Captain James Cook first charted the Bristol Bay region in 1778,but did not venture into Nushagak Bay. The Russian-American Company built a redoubt (trading post) at Nushagak Point, across the river from present-day Dillingham, in 1818; named &quot;Alexandrovski&quot; after the czar, the post attracted fur traders from as far as the Kuskokwim River, the Alaska Peninsula, and Cook Inlet. In 1837, a Russian Orthodox mission was built at Nushagak, but the post&#x27;s status was later downgraded in favor of other Russian-American Company posts in the Kuskokwim. In 1881, after the Alaska Purchase by the United States, the U.S. Signal Corps built a weather station at Nushagak.

In 1883, the Arctic Packing Company constructed the first cannery and seafood-processing plant in Bristol Bay at Kanulik, across the river from the site of modern-day Dillingham. Operations began the following year, with a pack of 400 cases of salmon, or 19.2k one-pound cans. By 1903 a total of ten canneries had been built along the Nushagak, including four within the city&#x27;s current limits, producing as many as one million cases of canned salmon, annually. Most of these canneries were closed in the 20th century for a variety of reasons, including coastal erosion, siltation, consolidation, and general changes in the industry, such as shifting focus to frozen fish.

In 1901, the Alaska-Portland Packers Association built a cannery near Snag Point, at what is now the city&#x27;s central business district. This cannery burned down in 1910, but was rebuilt the following year and was acquired by Pacific American Fisheries in 1929. Now known as Peter Pan Seafoods, the cannery in downtown Dillingham remains operational, and other seafood companies maintain corporate offices and support facilities within the city&#x27;s limits.

A courthouse was built in Kanakanak in 1903 and named after United States Senator William Paul Dillingham of Vermont, whose senate subcommittee investigated conditions in Alaska following the 1898 gold rush. Despite extensive travels throughout the territory, neither Dillingham nor his subcommittee ever set foot in the Bristol Bay region. Nonetheless, the post office later adopted the name, as did the entire community.

In 1918 and 1919, the global Spanish flu pandemic struck Bristol Bay, leaving no more than 500 survivors around Dillingham. A hospital and orphanage was established in Kanakanak after the epidemic, south of downtown Dillingham. An Indian Health Service hospital, operated by the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation, remains at Kanakanak.

The &quot;Dillingham News&quot;, the first local newspaper, was published in 1947 by the Dillingham Volunteer Fire Department as a way to attract new members. It was soon succeeded by the &quot;Beacon of Dillingham&quot;, a newspaper closely aligned by the unions of resident fishermen and cannery workers. Both were simple mimeograph editions.

In 1951, powerboats were first allowed to replace the sailboats used by fishermen in the Bristol Bay salmon fishery.

The City of Dillingham incorporated as a first class municipality in 1963.

In 1974, the first regional AM radio station for the Bristol Bay region was built by the Dillingham City School District under an educational grant. With the call letters KDLG and operating at 670 kHz, the station continues to provide education, entertainment, and important safety information to the fishing fleet and the surrounding communities. It is part of the National Public Radio (NPR) and Alaska Public Radio (APRN) networks.

Present-day industries around Dillingham are commercial salmon and herring fishing, seafood processing, sport fishing, government-related jobs and tourism.

Dillingham attracted national attention in 2006, when it installed 80 cameras at city-owned facilities and locations, such as the docks, harbor and police station, all funded by a Department of Homeland Security grant. The city justified the cameras by stating that they enhanced the ability to monitor and enforce security measures at those properties. Many criticized the project as an infringement on privacy, and also were critical that the funds were intended for national, rather than local, public safety issues. After spirited public debate, locally and nationally, the community held a referendum vote on the system on October 12, 2006, resulting in a rejection of the anti-camera initiative by a vote of 370 to 235.

On August 9, 2010, a DHC-3T Texas Turbine Otter crashed near Dillingham due to fog and reduced visibility. Former President Pro Tempore and Senator Ted Stevens was among the five killed aboard the plane. There were four survivors, including former NASA Administrator and EADS executive Sean O&#x27;Keefe.

On September 2, 2015, President Barack Obama visited Dillingham, as a part of his second-term trip around Alaska to call attention to climate change.

==Placenames==

Beginning in 1880, when census enumerators visited the present area of Dillingham at the northwest side of Nushagak Bay, they recorded only one village, that of Anagnak. Anagnak was apparently located on the Wood River near where it flows into Nushagak Bay and it reported 87 Inuit residents.

In 1890, enumerators reported two separate villages: Bradford and Kanakanak. Bradford, located at Bradford Point, was a cannery which reported 166 residents: 83 Asians, 82 Whites and 1 Native. Approximately &quot;1 kilometer south&quot; was the other village of Kanakanak, which reported 53 residents, all native. The earlier village of Anagnak (also called Anugnak) did not report at all.

In 1900, only one community was reported: Kanakanak (erroneously spelled on the census as &quot;Knankanak&quot;). However, this village, which reported 145 residents (but no racial breakdown), was not the same Kanakanak reported on the 1890 census. This was apparently a &quot;new&quot; village that had taken over the site of the former Bradford (and the cannery itself was demolished shortly after 1900). The previous Kanakanak was called &quot;Old Kanakanak.&quot; It was unknown if the &quot;New&quot; Kanakanak also included any residents from the old village.

In 1910, as with 1900, only one community was reported, and that was Kanakanak (this time correctly spelled), with 165 residents. However, again, this was apparently not the same locale in either the 1890 or 1900 censuses, but was located at Snag Point, about 3 miles north of the 1900 Kanakanak village. The alternative name reported was &quot;Chogiung.&quot; It was here in 1904 that the Dillingham Post Office first opened. At this time, it featured three different names (Chogiung, Kanakanak and Dillingham). Because census enumerators did not attempt to place the locales and boundaries on a map, it contributed to the confusion, which would persist for at least 4 more censuses.

In 1920, the census reported two villages: Chogiung and Dillingham. Chogiung, with 182 residents, was apparently the renamed 1910 Kanakanak (3rd village), but also was known as the Dillingham Post Office as this was the village at Snag Point. Again, compounding the confusion was the first appearance of the village of Dillingham. But this was apparently not the village with the post office, but the location of the former cannery of Bradford from the 1890 census and the 1900 &quot;New&quot; Kanakanak, and featured just 36 residents. Because of the influenza pandemic preceding the 1920 census, it caused much upheaval and movement of native persons all over Alaska, with the survivors of decimated villages relocating to new locales.

In 1930, the census reported three separate villages: Dillingham, Kanakanak &amp; Wood River. This Dillingham reported just 85 residents, and apparently was the renamed Chogiung/3rd Kanakanak village (however, it&#x27;s possible that it may have been the same 1920 Dillingham owing to the number of residents, and that it was erroneously reported). The second village was Kanakanak, which reported 177 residents. This was apparently the former 1920 Dillingham and &quot;New&quot; Kanakanak (the 2nd village from 1900). As cited, it is entirely possible that Dillingham &amp; Kanakanak were incorrectly reported under the others&#x27; names, and further research on individuals reported living in each would be required to solve this possible mystery. The third village cited on the 1930 census was Wood River (with 55 residents). This was apparently the locale of the 1880 Inuit village of Anagnak (Anugnak), which had not reported in 50 years.

In 1940, the census reported just two villages: Dillingham &amp; Kanakanak. Dillingham now reported 278 residents, and the presumption was that it was the present village at Snag Point. Kanakanak (the &quot;New&quot; or 2nd village and former Dillingham) reported 113 residents. Neither figure was able to adequately resolve the question as to whether the 1930 population figures were accidentally attributed to the wrong community.

1950 would be the last time both villages, Dillingham &amp; Kanakanak, would report. Dillingham would report 577 residents, while Kanakanak had declined to just 54 residents. In 1960 and in every successive census, Dillingham would be the sole community on the northwest Nushagak Bay to report on the census, and would formally incorporate as a city in 1963.

As for attempts to locate where the other census-reported villages (or remains of) are located at present, Anagnak (or Anugnak) (1880)/Wood Point (1930), is now within the present Dillingham city boundaries. Bradford (1890)/&quot;New&quot; Kanakanak (1900)/&quot;1st&quot; Dillingham (1920) (at Bradford Point) has since been annexed into the present Dillingham. The (3rd) Kanakanak (1910)/Chogiung (1920) is the present downtown of Dillingham. Only the original or &quot;Old&quot; Kanakanak apparently is outside the present city boundaries, just to the south of the Kanakanak Hospital.

<text>Togiak () is a city in Dillingham Census Area, Alaska, United States. At the 2010 census the population was 817, up from 809 in 2000.

==History==
Togiak is the successor village of two earlier Inuit villages, Togiagamute (Togiagamiut) &amp; Togiak Station (also known as Togiak or Owens). The prior two villages were on the eastern side of Togiak Bay. By the early 20th century, heavy winter snowfalls made wood gathering difficult, so residents began to relocate to the west side of the bay to the new village of Togiak, which first appeared on the 1920 census. The earlier village of Togiagamute is now within the adjacent Twin Hills CDP, and the old site is still occupied. Togiak Station, about 7 miles south of the former Togiagamute, is now a ghost.

The Togiak area became a draw for natives in the vicinity after the devastating influenza pandemic of 1918–19, which had almost wiped out many villages. Togiak was flooded in 1964, which prompted some residents to relocate and establish the new community of Twin Hills, northeast of the original village of Togiagamute on the upper east side of the bay.

==Geography==
Togiak is located at (59.059134, -160.383186), at the head of Togiak Bay, west of Dillingham. It lies in Togiak National Wildlife Refuge, and is the gateway to Walrus Island Game Sanctuary.

On the 1940 census, the area of &quot;Togiak Bay&quot; was reported separately, featuring 46 residents.

<text>Baix Llobregat () is a comarca (county) on the coast of Catalonia, Spain. It is located in the Barcelona region and its capital is Sant Feliu de Llobregat.

==Municipalities==
==Proposed changes==
It has long been proposed to split the northern part of Baix Llobregat into a separate comarca. The Catalan government&#x27;s &quot;Report on the revision of Catalonia&#x27;s territorial organisation model&quot; (the ), published in 2000, recommends many changes to comarcas, including the creation of , with its capital at Martorell, taking in several more municipalities from Alt Penedès, Anoia, Bages, and Vallès Occidental. Recent campaigns have referred to the proposed new comarca as &quot;Montserratí&quot;, due to the landmark Montserrat mountain marking part of its eastern border.

<doc id="105309" wikidata="Q246732" url="?curid=105309" title="Satyricon">
<text>The Satyricon, Satyricon liber (&quot;The Book of Satyrlike Adventures&quot;), or Satyrica, is a Latin work of fiction believed to have been written by Gaius Petronius in the late 1st century AD, though the manuscript tradition identifies the author as Titus Petronius. The &quot;Satyricon&quot; is an example of Menippean satire, which is different from the formal verse satire of Juvenal or Horace. The work contains a mixture of prose and verse (commonly known as ); serious and comic elements; and erotic and decadent passages. As with &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius (also called the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;), classical scholars often describe it as a Roman novel, without necessarily implying continuity with the modern literary form.

The surviving sections of the original (much longer) text detail the bizarre exploits of the narrator, Encolpius, and his (possible) slave and catamite Giton, a handsome sixteen-year-old boy. It is the second most fully preserved Roman novel, after the fully extant &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius, which has significant differences in style and plot. &quot;Satyricon&quot; is also regarded as useful evidence for the reconstruction of how lower classes lived during the early Roman Empire.

==Principal characters==
* Encolpius: The narrator and principal character, moderately well educated and presumably from a relatively elite background
* Giton: A handsome sixteen-year-old boy, a (possible) slave and a sexual partner of Encolpius
* Ascyltos: A friend of Encolpius, rival for the ownership of Giton
* Trimalchio: An extremely vulgar and wealthy freedman
* Eumolpus: An aged, impoverished and lecherous poet of the sort rich men are said to hate
* Lichas: An enemy of Encolpius
* Tryphaena: A woman infatuated with Giton
* Corax: A barber, the hired servant of Eumolpus
* Circe: A woman attracted to Encolpius
* Chrysis: Circe&#x27;s servant, also in love with Encolpius

==Synopsis==
The work is narrated by its central figure, Encolpius. The surviving sections of the novel begin with Encolpius traveling with a companion and former lover named Ascyltos, who has joined Encolpius on numerous escapades. Encolpius&#x27; slave, Giton, is at his owner&#x27;s lodging when the story begins.

===Chapters 1–26===
In the first passage preserved, Encolpius is in a Greek town in Campania, perhaps Puteoli, where he is standing outside a school, railing against the Asiatic style and false taste in literature, which he blames on the prevailing system of declamatory education (1–2). His adversary in this debate is Agamemnon, a sophist, who shifts the blame from the teachers to the parents (3–5). Encolpius discovers that his companion Ascyltos has left and breaks away from Agamemnon when a group of students arrive (6).

Encolpius then gets lost and asks an old woman for help returning home. She takes him to a brothel which she refers to as his home. There, Encolpius locates Ascyltos (7–8) and then Giton (8), who claims that Ascyltos made a sexual attempt on him (9). After raising their voices against each other, the fight ends in laughter and the friends reconcile but still agree to split at a later date (9–10). Later, Encolpius tries to have sex with Giton, but is interrupted by Ascyltos, who assaults him after catching the two in bed (11). The three go to the market, where they are involved in a convoluted dispute over stolen property (12–15). Returning to their lodgings, they are confronted by Quartilla, a devotee of Priapus, who condemns their attempts to pry into the cult&#x27;s secrets (16–18).

The companions are overpowered by Quartilla, her maids, and an aged &quot;cinaedus&quot;, who sexually torture them (19–21), then provide them with dinner and engage them in further sexual activity (21–26). An orgy ensues and the sequence ends with Encolpius and Quartilla exchanging kisses while they spy through a keyhole at the mock-wedding between Giton and Pennychis, a seven-year-old virgin girl (26).

===Chapters 26–78, &quot;Cena Trimalchionis&quot; (Trimalchio&#x27;s dinner)===
This section of the Satyricon, regarded by classicists such as Conte and Rankin as emblematic of Menippean satire, takes place a day or two after the beginning of the extant story. Encolpius and companions are invited by one of Agamemnon&#x27;s slaves to a dinner at the estate of Trimalchio, a freedman of enormous wealth, who entertains his guests with ostentatious and grotesque extravagance. After preliminaries in the baths and halls (26–30), the guests (mostly freedmen) enter the dining room, where their host joins them.

Extravagant courses are served while Trimalchio flaunts his wealth and his pretence of learning (31–41). Trimalchio&#x27;s departure to the toilet (he is incontinent) allows space for conversation among the guests (41–46). Encolpius listens to their ordinary talk about their neighbors, about the weather, about the hard times, about the public games, and about the education of their children. In his insightful depiction of everyday Roman life, Petronius delights in exposing the vulgarity and pretentiousness of the illiterate and ostentatious wealthy of his age.

After Trimalchio&#x27;s return from the lavatory (47), the succession of courses is resumed, some of them disguised as other kinds of food or arranged to resemble certain zodiac signs (35). Falling into an argument with Agamemnon (a guest who secretly holds Trimalchio in disdain), Trimalchio reveals that he once saw the Sibyl of Cumae, who because of her great age was suspended in a flask for eternity (48).

Supernatural stories about a werewolf (62) and witches are told (63). Following a lull in the conversation, a stonemason named Habinnas arrives with his wife Scintilla (65), who compares jewellery with Trimalchio&#x27;s wife Fortunata (67). Then Trimalchio sets forth his will and gives Habinnas instructions on how to build his monument when he is dead (71).

Encolpius and his companions, by now wearied and disgusted, try to leave as the other guests proceed to the baths, but are prevented by a porter (72). They escape only after Trimalchio holds a mock funeral for himself. The , mistaking the sound of horns for a signal that a fire has broken out, burst into the residence (78). Using this sudden alarm as an excuse to get rid of the sophist Agamemnon, whose company Encolpius and his friends are weary of, they flee as if from a real fire (78).

===Chapters 79–98===
Encolpius returns with his companions to the inn but, having drunk too much wine, passes out while Ascyltos takes advantage of the situation and seduces Giton (79). On the next day, Encolpius wakes to find his lover and Ascyltos in bed together naked. Encolpius quarrels with Ascyltos and the two agree to part, but Encolpius is shocked when Giton decides to stay with Ascyltos (80). After two or three days spent in separate lodgings sulking and brooding on his revenge, Encolpius sets out with sword in hand, but is disarmed by a soldier he encounters in the street (81–82).

After entering a picture gallery, he meets with an old poet, Eumolpus. The two exchange complaints about their misfortunes (83–84), and Eumolpus tells how, when he pursued an affair with a boy in Pergamon while employed as his tutor, the youth wore him out with his own high libido (85–87). After talking about the decay of art and the inferiority of the painters and writers of the age to the old masters (88), Eumolpus illustrates a picture of the capture of Troy, &quot;Troiae Halosis&quot;. by some verses on that theme (89).

This ends when those who are walking in the adjoining colonnade drive Eumolpus out with stones (90). Encolpius invites Eumolpus to dinner. As he returns home, Encolpius encounters Giton, who begs him to take him back as his lover. Encolpius finally forgives him (91). Eumolpus arrives from the baths and reveals that a man there (evidently Ascyltos) was looking for someone called Giton (92).

Encolpius decides not to reveal Giton&#x27;s identity, but he and the poet fall into rivalry over the boy (93–94). This leads to a fight between Eumolpus and the other residents of the (95–96), which is broken up by the manager Bargates. Then Ascyltos arrives with a municipal slave to search for Giton, who hides under a bed at Encolpius&#x27;s request (97). Eumolpus threatens to reveal him but after much negotiation ends up reconciled to Encolpius and Giton (98).

===Chapters 99–124===
In the next scene preserved, Encolpius and his friends board a ship, along with Eumolpus&#x27;s hired servant, later named as Corax (99). Encolpius belatedly discovers that the captain is an old enemy, Lichas of Tarentum. Also on board is a woman called Tryphaena, by whom Giton does not want to be discovered (100–101). Despite their attempt to disguise themselves as Eumolpus&#x27;s slaves (103), Encolpius and Giton are identified (105).

Eumolpus speaks in their defence (107), but it is only after fighting breaks out (108) that peace is agreed (109). To maintain good feelings, Eumolpus tells the story of a widow of Ephesus. At first she planned to starve herself to death in her husband&#x27;s tomb, but she was seduced by a soldier guarding crucified corpses, and when one of these was stolen she offered the corpse of her husband as a replacement (110–112).

The ship is wrecked in a storm (114). Encolpius, Giton, and Eumolpus get to shore safely (as apparently does Corax), but Lichas is washed ashore drowned (115). The companions learn they are in the neighbourhood of Crotona, and that the inhabitants are notorious legacy-hunters (116). Eumolpus proposes taking advantage of this, and it is agreed that he will pose as a childless, sickly man of wealth, and the others as his slaves (117).

As they travel to the city, Eumolpus lectures on the need for elevated content in poetry (118), which he illustrates with a poem of almost 300 lines on the Civil War between Julius Caesar and Pompey (119–124). When they arrive in Crotona, the legacy-hunters prove hospitable.

===Chapters 125–141===
When the text resumes, the companions have apparently been in Crotona for some time (125). A maid named Chrysis flirts with Encolpius and brings to him her beautiful mistress Circe, who asks him for sex. However, his attempts are prevented by impotence (126–128). Circe and Encolpius exchange letters, and he seeks a cure by sleeping without Giton (129–130). When he next meets Circe, she brings with her an elderly enchantress called Proselenos who attempts a magical cure (131). Nonetheless, he fails again to make love, as Circe has Chrysis and him flogged (132).

Encolpius is tempted to sever the offending organ, but prays to Priapus at his temple for healing (133). Proselenos and the priestess Oenothea arrive. Oenothea, who is also a sorceress, claims she can provide the cure desired by Encolpius and begins cooking (134–135). While the women are temporarily absent, Encolpius is attacked by the temple&#x27;s sacred geese and kills one of them. Oenothea is horrified, but Encolpius pacifies her with an offer of money (136–137).

Oenothea tears open the breast of the goose, and uses its liver to foretell Encolpius&#x27;s future (137). That accomplished, the priestess reveals a &quot;leather dildo&quot; (), and the women apply various irritants to him, which they use to prepare Encolpius for anal penetration (138). Encolpius flees from Oenothea and her assistants. In the following chapters, Chrysis herself falls in love with Encolpius (138–139).

An aging legacy-huntress named Philomela places her son and daughter with Eumolpus, ostensibly for education. Eumolpus makes love to the daughter, although because of his pretence of ill health he requires the help of Corax. After fondling the son, Encolpius reveals that he has somehow been cured of his impotence (140). He warns Eumolpus that, because the wealth he claims to have has not appeared, the patience of the legacy-hunters is running out. Eumolpus&#x27;s will is read to the legacy-hunters, who apparently now believe he is dead, and they learn they can inherit only if they consume his body. In the final passage preserved, historical examples of cannibalism are cited (141).

==Reconstruction of lost sections==
:In the text below &quot;books&quot; refers to what modern readers would call &quot;chapters&quot;.

Although interrupted by frequent gaps, 141 sections of consecutive narrative have been preserved. These can be compiled into the length of a longer novella. The extant portions were supposedly &quot;from the 15th and 16th books&quot; from a notation on a manuscript found in Trau in Dalmatia in 1663 by Petit. However, according to translator and classicist William Arrowsmith,
: &quot;this evidence is late and unreliable and needs to be treated with reserve, all the more since – even on the assumption that the &quot;Satyricon&quot; contained 16 rather than, say, 20 or 24 books – the result would have been a work of unprecedented length.&quot;
Still, speculation as to the size of the original puts it somewhere on the order of a work of thousands of pages, and comparisons for length range from &quot;Tom Jones&quot; to &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. The extant text runs to 140 pages in the Arrowsmith edition. The complete novel must have been considerably longer, but its true length cannot be known.

Statements in the extant narrative allow the reconstruction of some events that must have taken place earlier in the work. Encolpius and Giton have had contact with Lichas and Tryphaena. Both seem to have been lovers of Tryphaena (113) at a cost to her reputation (106). Lichas&#x27; identification of Encolpius by examining his groin (105) implies that they have also had sexual relations. Lichas&#x27; wife has been seduced (106) and his ship robbed (113).

Encolpius states at one point,
: &quot;I escaped the law, cheated the arena, killed a host&quot; (81).
To many scholars, that suggests Encolpius had been condemned for a crime of murder, or more likely he simply feared being sentenced, to fight to his death in the arena. The statement probably is linked to an earlier insult by Ascyltos (9), who called Encolpius a &quot;gladiator&quot;. One scholar speculates that Encolpius had been an actual gladiator rather than a criminal, but there is no clear evidence in the surviving text for that interpretation.

A number of fragments of Petronius&#x27;s work are preserved in other authors. Servius cites Petronius as his source for a custom at Massilia of allowing a poor man, during times of plague, to volunteer to serve as a scapegoat, receiving support for a year at public expense and then being expelled. Sidonius Apollinaris refers to &quot;Arbiter&quot;, by which he apparently means Petronius&#x27;s narrator Encolpius, as a worshipper of the &quot;sacred stake&quot; of Priapus in the gardens of Massilia. It has been proposed that Encolpius&#x27;s wanderings began after he offered himself as the scapegoat and was ritually expelled. Other fragments may relate to a trial scene.

Among the poems ascribed to Petronius is an oracle predicting travels to the Danube and to Egypt. Courtney notes that the prominence of Egypt in the ancient Greek novels might make it plausible for Petronius to have set an episode there, but expresses some doubt about the oracle&#x27;s relevance to Encolpius&#x27;s travels,
: &quot;since we have no reason to suppose that Encolpius reached the Danube or the far north, and we cannot suggest any reason why he should have.&quot;

==Analysis==
===Date and authorship===
The date of the &quot;Satyricon&quot; was controversial in 19th- and 20th-century scholarship, with dates proposed as varied as the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD. A consensus on this issue now exists. A date under Nero (1st century AD) is indicated by the work&#x27;s social background and in particular by references to named popular entertainers.

Evidence in the author&#x27;s style and literary concerns also indicate that this was the period during which he was writing. Except where the &quot;Satyricon&quot; imitates colloquial language, as in the speeches of the freedmen at Trimalchio&#x27;s dinner, its style corresponds with the literary prose of the period. Eumolpus&#x27; poem on the Civil War and the remarks with which he prefaces it (118–124) are generally understood as a response to the &quot;Pharsalia&quot; of the Neronian poet Lucan.

Similarly, Eumolpus&#x27;s poem on the capture of Troy (89) has been related to Nero&#x27;s &quot;Troica&quot; and to the tragedies of Seneca the Younger, and parody of Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Epistles&quot; has been detected in the moralizing remarks of characters in the &quot;Satyricon&quot;. There is disagreement about the value of some individual arguments but, according to S. J. Harrison, &quot;almost all scholars now support a Neronian date&quot; for the work.

The manuscripts of the &quot;Satyricon&quot; ascribe the work to a &quot;Petronius Arbiter&quot;, while a number of ancient authors (Macrobius, Sidonius Apollinaris, Marius Victorinus, Diomedes and Jerome) refer to the author as &quot;Arbiter&quot;. The name Arbiter is likely derived from Tacitus&#x27; reference to a courtier named Petronius as Nero&#x27;s &quot;arbiter elegantiae&quot; or fashion adviser (&quot;Annals&quot; 16.18.2). That the author is the same as this courtier is disputed. Many modern scholars accept the identification, pointing to a perceived similarity of character between the two and to possible references to affairs at the Neronian court. Other scholars consider this identification &quot;beyond conclusive proof&quot;.

===Genre===
The &quot;Satyricon&quot; is considered one of the gems of Western literature, and, according to Branham, it is the earliest of its kind in Latin. Petronius mixes together two antithetical genres: the cynic and parodic menippean satire, and the idealizing and sentimental Greek romance. The mixing of these two radically contrasting genres generates the sophisticated humor and ironic tone of &quot;Satyricon&quot;.

The name “satyricon” implies that the work belongs to the type to which Varro, imitating the Greek Menippus, had given the character of a medley of prose and verse composition. But the string of fictitious narrative by which the medley is held together is something quite new in Roman literature. The author was happily inspired in his devices for amusing himself and thereby transmitted to modern times a text based on the ordinary experience of contemporary life; the precursor of such novels as &quot;Gil Blas&quot; by Alain-René Lesage and &quot;The Adventures of Roderick Random&quot; by Tobias Smollett. It reminds the well-read protagonist of Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27;s &quot;À rebours&quot; of certain nineteenth-century French novels: &quot;In its highly polished style, its astute observation, its solid structure, he could discern curious parallels and strange analogies with the handful of modern French novels he was able to tolerate.&quot;

==Literary and cultural legacy==
===Apocryphal supplements===

The incomplete form in which the &quot;Satyricon&quot; survives has tantalized many readers, and between 1692 and the present several writers have attempted to round the story out. In certain cases, following a well-known conceit of historical fiction, these invented supplements have been claimed to derive from newly discovered manuscripts, a claim that may appear all the more plausible since the real fragments actually came from two different medieval sources and were only brought together by 16th- and 17th-century editors. The claims have been exposed by modern scholarship, even 21st-century apocryphal supplements.

===Historical contributions===
The Satyricon provides description, conversation, and stories that have become invaluable evidence of colloquial Latin. In the realism of Trimalchio&#x27;s dinner party, we are provided with informal that abounds in vulgarisms and solecisms which give us insight into the unknown Roman proletariat.

Chapter 41, the dinner with Trimalchio, depicts such a conversation after the overbearing host has left the room. A guest at the party, Dama, after calling for a cup of wine, begins first:

===Modern literature===
In the process of coming up with the title of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, F. Scott Fitzgerald had considered several titles for his book including &quot;Trimalchio&quot; and &quot;Trimalchio in West Egg;&quot; Fitzgerald characterizes Gatsby as Trimalchio in the novel, notably in the first paragraph of Chapter VII:

An early version of the novel, still titled &quot;Trimalchio&quot;, was published by the Cambridge University Press.

T. S. Eliot&#x27;s seminal poem of cultural disintegration, &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, is prefaced by a verbatim quotation out of Trimalchio&#x27;s account of visiting the Cumaean Sibyl (Chapter 48), a supposedly immortal prophetess whose counsel was once sought on all matters of grave importance, but whose grotto by Neronian times had become just another site of local interest along with all the usual Mediterranean tourist traps:

Arrowsmith translates:
In Isaac Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;All the Troubles of the World&quot;, Asimov&#x27;s recurring character Multivac, a supercomputer entrusted with analyzing and finding solutions to the world&#x27;s problems, is asked &quot;Multivac, what do you yourself want more than anything else?&quot; and, like the &quot;Satyricon&quot;&#x27;s Sibyl when faced with the same question, responds &quot;I want to die.&quot;

A sentence written by Petronius in a satyrical sense, to represent one of the many gross absurdities told by Trimalchio, reveals the feeling present in some Latin literature; a feeling perfectly seized by T. S. Eliot.

Oscar Wilde&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, mentions &quot;What to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the &quot;Satyricon&quot; once had been.&quot;

DBC Pierre&#x27;s novel &quot;Lights Out in Wonderland&quot; repeatedly references the &quot;Satyricon&quot;.

===Graphic arts===
A series of 100 etchings illustrating the &quot;Satyricon&quot; was made by the Australian artist Norman Lindsay. These were included in several 20th century translations, including, eventually, one by the artist&#x27;s son Jack Lindsay.

===Film===
In 1969 two film versions were made. &quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot;, directed by Federico Fellini, was loosely based upon the book. The film is deliberately fragmented and surreal though the androgynous Giton (Max Born) gives the graphic picture of Petronius&#x27;s character. Among the chief narrative changes Fellini makes to the &quot;Satyricon&quot; text is the addition of a hermaphroditic priestess, who does not exist in the Petronian version.

In Fellini&#x27;s adaptation, the fact that Ascyltos abducts this hermaphrodite, who later dies a miserable death in a desert landscape, is posed as an ill-omened event, and leads to the death of Ascyltos later in the film (none of which is to be found in the Petronian version). Other additions Fellini makes in his filmic adaptation: the appearance of a minotaur in a labyrinth (who first tries to club Encolpius to death, and then attempts to kiss him), and the appearance of a nymphomaniac whose husband hires Ascyltos to enter her caravan and have sex with her.

The other movie, &quot;Satyricon&quot;, was directed by Gian Luigi Polidoro.

===Music and theatre===
The Norwegian black metal band Satyricon is named after the book.

American composer James Nathaniel Holland adapted the story and wrote music for the ballet, &quot;The Satyricon&quot;.

Paul Foster wrote a play (called &quot;Satyricon&quot;) based on the book, directed by John Vaccaro at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in 1972.

British director Martin Foreman wrote a play (titled &quot;The Satyricon&quot;) based on the novel. It was staged in Edinburgh in October 2022 as a co-production between Arbery Theatre and the Edinburgh Graduate Theatre Group. In Foreman&#x27;s adaptation the presumed author of the book, Petronius, plays an editorializing role, commenting on structural aspects of the text, such as its fragmentary nature, as well as on philosophical themes it addresses, such as 1st-century AD Roman attitudes to slavery.

==English translations==

<text>Imre Kertész (; 9 November 192931 March 2016) was a Hungarian author and recipient of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Literature, &quot;for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history&quot;. He was the first Hungarian to win the Nobel in Literature. His works deal with themes of the Holocaust (he was a survivor of German concentration and death camps), dictatorship, and personal freedom.

== Life and work ==
Kertész was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 9 November 1929, the son of Aranka Jakab and László Kertész, a middle-class Jewish couple. After his parents separated when he was around the age of five, Kertész attended a boarding school, and, in 1940, he started secondary school where he was put into a special class for Jewish students. During World War II, Kertész was deported in 1944 at the age of 14 with other Hungarian Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and was later sent to Buchenwald. Upon his arrival at Auschwitz, Kertész claimed to be a 16-year-old worker, thus saving him from the instant extermination that awaited a 14-year-old person. After his camp was liberated in 1945, Kertész returned to Budapest, graduated from high school in 1948, and then went on to find work as a journalist and translator. In 1951, he lost his job at the journal &quot;Világosság&quot; (Clarity), after the publication started leaning towards Communism. For a short term, he worked as a factory worker, and then in the press department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. From 1953, he started freelance journalism and translated various works into Hungarian, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Elias Canetti.

His best-known work, &quot;Fatelessness&quot; (&quot;Sorstalanság&quot;), describes the experience of 15-year-old György (George) Köves in the concentration camps of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Zeitz. Written between 1969 and 1973, the novel was initially rejected for publication by the Communist regime in Hungary, but was published in 1975. Some have interpreted the book as quasi-autobiographical, but the author disavows a strong biographical connection. The book would go on to become part of many high school curriculums in Hungary. In 2005, a film based on the novel, for which he wrote the script, was made in Hungary. Although sharing the same title, some reviews noted that the film was more autobiographical than the novel on which it was based. It was released internationally at various dates in 2005 and 2006.

Following on from &quot;Fatelessness&quot;, Kertész&#x27;s &quot;Fiasco&quot; (1988) and &quot;Kaddish for an Unborn Child&quot; (1990) are, respectively, the second and third parts of his Holocaust trilogy. His writings translated into English include &quot;Kaddish for an Unborn Child&quot; (&quot;Kaddis a meg nem született gyermekért&quot;) and &quot;Liquidation&quot; (&quot;Felszámolás&quot;), the latter set during the period of Hungary&#x27;s evolution into a democracy from communist rule.

From the beginning, Kertész found little appreciation for his writing in Hungary, and he moved to Germany, where he received more active support from publishers and reviewers, along with more appreciative readers. After his move, he continued translating German works into Hungarian, notably &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, the plays of Dürrenmatt, Schnitzler, and Tankred Dorst, and various thoughts and aphorisms of Wittgenstein. Kertész also continued working at his craft, writing his fiction in Hungarian, but did not publish another novel until the late 1980s. From that point on, he submitted his work to publishers in Hungary. Grateful that he had found his most significant success as a writer and artist in Germany, Kertész left his abatement to the Academy of Arts in Berlin.

In November 2013, Kertész underwent successful surgery on his right hip, after falling down in his home. However, he continued to deal with various health concerns during the last few years of his life. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and was again suffering from depression, reported to have been a recurring battle in his life. In fact, Kertész had struggled with this same issue in his writing, as the main character of his 2003 book &quot;Felszámolás&quot; (&quot;Liquidation&quot;) commits suicide after struggling with depression.

Kertész died on 31 March 2016, at the age of 86, at his home in Budapest, after suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s for several years.

== Controversy ==
Kertész was a controversial figure within Hungary, especially since being Hungary&#x27;s first, and only, Nobel Laureate in Literature, he still lived in Germany. This tension was exacerbated by a 2009 interview with &quot;Die Welt&quot;, in which Kertész vowed himself a &quot;Berliner&quot; and called Budapest &quot;completely balkanized&quot;. Many Hungarian newspapers reacted negatively to this statement, claiming it to be hypocritical. Other critics viewed the Budapest comment ironically, saying it represented &quot;a grudge policy that is painfully and unmistakably, characteristically Hungarian&quot;. Kertész later clarified in a Duna TV interview that he had intended his comment to be &quot;constructive&quot;, and called Hungary &quot;his homeland&quot;.

Also controversial was Kertész&#x27;s criticism of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s depiction of the Holocaust in the 1993 film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; as &quot;kitsch&quot;, saying: &quot;I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life (whether in the private sphere or on the level of &#x27;civilization&#x27; as such) and the very possibility of the Holocaust.&quot;

In November 2014, Kertész was the subject of an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Kertész claimed the reporter was expecting him to question Hungary&#x27;s democratic values and was shocked to hear Kertész say that &quot;the situation in Hungary is nice, I&#x27;m having a great time&quot;. According to Kertész, &quot;he didn&#x27;t like my answer. His purpose must have been to make me call Hungary a dictatorship which it isn&#x27;t. In the end, the interview was never published.&quot;

<doc id="105319" wikidata="Q456688" url="?curid=105319" title="Bobby Hull">
<text>Robert Marvin Hull (January 3, 1939 – January 30, 2023) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. His blond hair, skating speed, end-to-end rushes, and ability to shoot the puck at very high velocity all earned him the nickname &quot;the Golden Jet&quot;. His talents were such that an opposing player was often assigned just to shadow him.

During his 23-year playing career, from 1957 to 1980, he played in both the National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA) with the Chicago Black Hawks, Winnipeg Jets, and Hartford Whalers. He won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player twice and the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading point scorer three times, while helping the Black Hawks win the Stanley Cup in 1961. He also led the WHA&#x27;s Winnipeg Jets to Avco Cup championships in 1976 and 1978. He led the NHL in goals seven times, the second most of any player in history, and led the WHA in goals one additional time while being the WHA&#x27;s most valuable player two times. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1997, and received the Wayne Gretzky International Award in 2003. In 2017 Hull was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

Off the ice, Hull was noted for domestic violence allegations and allegedly making comments supporting Adolf Hitler.

==Early life==
Hull was born in Point Anne, Ontario, on January 3, 1939. He was the son of Lena Cook and Robert Edward Hull, a cement company foreman. He played his minor hockey in nearby Belleville, and then Junior B hockey for the Woodstock Warriors in the fall of 1954. Hull led the Warriors to the 1955 Sutherland Cup as Ontario champions. Later, he played for the Galt Black Hawks and the St. Catharines Teepees in the Ontario Hockey Association, before joining the Chicago Black Hawks in 1957 at the age of 18.

==Playing career==

===NHL career===

Hull had a solid debut year, finishing second in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy. Hull originally wore numbers 16 and 7 as a Black Hawk but later switched to his famous number 9, a tribute to his childhood idol Gordie Howe. By his third season (1959–60), he led the league in goal- and point-scoring (the Art Ross Trophy), a double feat which he also achieved in 1961–62 and 1965–66. He led Chicago to the Stanley Cup in 1961—their third overall and first in 23 years. He finished second in point-scoring three further times.

On March 12, 1966, Hull became the first NHL player to score more than 50 goals in a season, surpassing Maurice Richard&#x27;s, Bernie Geoffrion&#x27;s, and his own mark of 50 goals. His 51st goal, scored on Cesare Maniago of the New York Rangers, earned him a seven-minute standing ovation from the Chicago Stadium faithful. Hull eventually scored 54 goals that season, the highest single-season total of the Original Six era. That same year, Hull set the record for the most points in a season with 97, one more than the previous record set by Dickie Moore 7 years earlier. His point total was tied the next year by teammate Stan Mikita and their record was broken three years later by Phil Esposito. Hull led the league in goal-scoring seven times during the 1960s. In 1968–69, despite Hull breaking his own goals in a season record by four goals (netting 58) and setting a career NHL high of 107 points (second in the league that year), the Hawks missed the playoffs for the first time since his rookie season. By his final NHL season, he had scored 50 goals or more a remarkable five times. This was only one time less than all other players in NHL history combined up until that point in time.

In his 15 full NHL seasons he was voted the First-Team All-Star left winger ten times and the Second-Team All-Star left winger twice. His slapshot was once clocked at 118.3 mph (190.5 km/h) and he could skate 29.7 mph (47.8 km/h). During his drive to be the first to eclipse the 50 goal mark, Hull&#x27;s wrist shot was said to be harder than his slapshot.

====&quot;Bobby Hull Rule&quot;====
Hull and teammate Stan Mikita were catalysts for a 1960s craze where players curved the blades of their hockey sticks, which became widely referred to as &quot;banana blades&quot;. Hull is the player typically linked most to the rule that banned this practice because of the potential danger to goalies, few of whom wore masks in that era. The curved blade made the puck&#x27;s trajectory unpredictable. The rule originally limited the blade curvature to between and ; in 1970, it was set at . NHL Rule 10.1 currently limits the curvature to .

===WHA career===
Long unhappy with his poor salary despite being one of hockey&#x27;s preeminent superstars, Hull responded to overtures from the upstart World Hockey Association&#x27;s Winnipeg Jets in 1972 by jesting that he would jump to them for a million dollars, a sum then considered absurd. Gathering the other league owners together to contribute to the unprecedented amount on the grounds that inking such a major star gave instant credibility to the new rival league that was competing directly against the entrenched NHL, Jets owner Ben Hatskin agreed to the sum, and signed Hull as a player-coach for a contract worth $1.75 million over 10 years plus a $1 million signing bonus. Although his debut with Winnipeg was held up in litigation by the NHL, Hull instantly became the WHA&#x27;s greatest star winning the Gordie Howe Trophy as league MVP in 1972–73 and 1974–75. With Swedish linemates Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson he formed one of the most formidable forward lines of the 1970s (known as &quot;The Hot Line&quot;), leading the Jets to two AVCO Cups during his time with the club. His best performance was during the 1974–75 season, when he scored 77 goals to set a new professional mark, while adding 65 assists for a total of 142 points, five behind the league leader, one of two times he finished second in the point-scoring race in the WHA. In the five WHA seasons in which he played more than half the schedule, he was voted a First-Team All-Star thrice and a Second-Team All-Star twice, while tallying 50 goals and 100 points four times each.

Because he joined the rival league, Hull was not allowed to represent Team Canada in the 1972 Summit Series, which pitted Canada&#x27;s top NHL players against the USSR&#x27;s national team. Two years later, a second Summit Series was held in which Hull and other top WHA stars (including Gordie Howe, who had been retired from the NHL at the time of the initial Summit Series) competed against the Soviet national team. The WHA lost the series four games to one (three ending in a tie), despite Hull&#x27;s seven goals. He was a key member of the Canadian squad that won the 1976 Canada Cup, though, scoring five goals and three assists in seven games.

===Later career and retirements===
Slowed by injuries and age, Hull played only a few games in the WHA&#x27;s final season of 1978–79. However, after the 1979 merger of the two leagues (including the Jets) and reportedly in financial straits, Hull came out of retirement to play once more for the NHL Jets. He played in eighteen games before being traded to the Hartford Whalers for future considerations, bringing the two-time Gordie Howe Trophy winner together with the 51-year-old Howe himself (who, after Hull&#x27;s initial contest with the Whalers, told the press, &quot;The kid looks good in his first game.&quot;). Hull played effectively in nine games (two goals and five assists) and three playoff games before retiring once more to care for his partner, who had been injured in an automobile accident.

In September 1981, Hull attempted one final comeback with the New York Rangers at age 42, at the suggestion of Rangers coach Herb Brooks, who wanted to try reuniting Hull with his former Jets teammates, Hedberg and Nilsson. The comeback attempt lasted five exhibition games, during which Hull had one goal and one assist, before he and the Rangers both decided it was best to end the comeback. It was the second time in Hull&#x27;s career that he had played exhibition games with the Rangers; in 1959, after missing the playoffs the previous spring, the Rangers and the Boston Bruins had been sent on an exhibition tour of Europe, and then-emerging star Hull and Eddie Shack were added to the Rangers&#x27; roster for the tour. Hull and Shack co-led the Rangers in scoring, each netting 14 goals over the 23-game tour.

Hull ended his career having played in 1,063 NHL games, accumulating 610 goals, 560 assists, 1,170 points, 640 penalty minutes, three Art Ross Trophies, two Hart Memorial Trophies (he finished second or third in the voting an additional six times), a Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, and a Stanley Cup Championship, adding 62 goals and 67 assists for 129 points in 119 playoff games. He played in 411 WHA games, scoring 303 goals, 335 assists, and 638 points, adding 43 goals and 37 assists in 60 playoff games. His North American major league professional total of 1,018 goals (NHL and WHA including playoffs) is the third most of all-time after Wayne Gretzky (1,072) and Gordie Howe (1,071), although the NHL does not recognize scoring statistics from the WHA in players&#x27; career totals.

==Post-playing career==
In 1978, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Besides his Hall of Fame induction, Hull&#x27;s no. 9 jersey has been retired by the Black Hawks, the Jets, and their successor team, the Arizona Coyotes. When Bobby&#x27;s son Brett Hull joined the Coyotes, they unretired the number for Brett to wear during his brief stint there to honour his father. Evander Kane, who wore number 9 for the current Winnipeg Jets franchise, sought and received Hull&#x27;s permission to wear the number.

In 2003, he was named the figurehead commissioner of a new World Hockey Association, intended to operate during the 2004–05 NHL lockout; it never entered play, and the organization subsequently ran several ephemeral low-minor league and unsanctioned Tier II junior leagues. Hull served as an ambassador for the Blackhawks through part of the 2021–22 season until the organization announced, &quot;When it comes to Bobby, specifically, we jointly agreed earlier this season that he will retire from any official team role.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Hull&#x27;s younger brother Dennis (nicknamed &quot;the Silver Jet&quot;) starred alongside him with the Chicago Black Hawks for eight seasons, scoring over 300 goals in his own right. When Bobby was excluded from the 1972 Summit Series because he had signed to play in the WHA, Dennis initially planned to boycott the event as well as a show of support for his brother, but Bobby persuaded him to stay on Team Canada.

Hull&#x27;s marriage to Joanne McKay ended in divorce in 1980 after several abusive incidents.

In 1986, he was arrested and charged with assault and battery after allegedly hitting his third wife, Deborah, after an argument. She eventually dropped the charges.
Hull was romantically involved with a woman named Claudia Allen. In 1980, Hull retired from the Hartford Whalers to take care of Allen, who was injured in a severe automobile accident. The couple never married.

In 1998, Hull allegedly made pro-Nazi comments to &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;. He was quoted as saying, &quot;Hitler, for example, had some good ideas. He just went a little bit too far.&quot; Hull later denied having complimented Hitler and said journalists had raised the subject. The incident was parodied on the Canadian news satire show &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, with Rick Mercer reading a spot saying Hull had been misquoted, and had actually said, &quot;&quot;Sittler&quot; had some good ideas.&quot;

===Children===
Brett Hull (the &quot;Golden Brett&quot;), was also a hockey star, finishing his NHL career with 741 goals (currently the fifth-highest goal total in NHL history). Bobby and Brett are the only father-and-son tandem to achieve the marks of more than 50 goals in an NHL season and more than 600 NHL goals. They are also the only father-and-son duo to win the Hart Memorial Trophy (Bobby twice and Brett once) and Lady Byng Trophy, and to lead the league in goal scoring (Bobby seven times and Brett three times). While playing for the Phoenix Coyotes in 2005, Brett donned his father&#x27;s retired No. 9 for the last five games of his career.

Bart Hull was a standout running back for the Boise State University&#x27; Broncos football team and played with the Ottawa Rough Riders and Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Canadian Football League (CFL) as well as one season of professional indoor football prior to recurring injuries. Post football, he briefly played professional hockey with the Idaho Steelheads.

Bobby Jr. and Blake both played junior and senior hockey. Bobby Jr. won the Memorial Cup with the 1980 Cornwall Royals. Later, the brothers played together for the Allan Cup-winning Brantford Mott&#x27;s Clamatos of the OHA Senior A Hockey League (AAA Men&#x27;s Amateur) in 1987.

Hull&#x27;s daughter, Michelle, was an accomplished figure skater, becoming British Columbia Pre-Novice Champion at the age of 11. After many knee injuries, she ended her figure skating career and is now an attorney licensed in two states. She works with battered women as a result of witnessing her father&#x27;s treatment of her mother, Joanne McKay.

===Bobby Hull Community Rink===

The Town of Cicero, Illinois created a public outdoor rink in his name. The rink hosts skating lessons, public skate, public Stick &amp; Puck, High School Hockey games, and more.

===Death===
On January 30, 2023, Hull died at his home in Wheaton, Illinois, at the age of 84. His son Brett released a statement following his father&#x27;s death via the Twitter account of the St. Louis Blues.

In February 2025, Hull&#x27;s family released a statement saying that researchers had determined that Hull had stage 2 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at the time of his death.

<doc id="105323" wikidata="Q22688" url="?curid=105323" title="Freedom of the press">
<text>Freedom of the press or freedom of the media is the fundamental principle that communication and expression through various media, including printed and electronic media, especially published materials, should be considered a right to be exercised freely. Such freedom implies the absence of interference from an overreaching state; its preservation may be sought through a constitution or other legal protection and security. It is in opposition to paid press, where communities, police organizations, and governments are paid for their copyrights.

Without respect to governmental information, any government may distinguish which materials are public or protected from disclosure to the public. State materials are protected due to either one of two reasons: the classification of information as sensitive, classified, or secret, or the relevance of the information to protecting the national interest. Many governments are also subject to &quot;sunshine laws&quot; or freedom of information legislation that define the ambit of national interest and enable citizens to request access to government-held information.

The United Nations&#x27; 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.&quot;

This philosophy is usually accompanied by legislation ensuring various degrees of freedom of scientific research (known as scientific freedom), publishing, and the press. The depth to which these laws are entrenched in a country&#x27;s legal system can go as far down as its constitution. The concept of freedom of speech is often covered by the same laws as freedom of the press, thereby giving equal treatment to spoken and published expression. Freedom of the press was formally established in Great Britain with the lapse of the Licensing Act in 1695. Sweden was the first country in the world to adopt freedom of the press into its constitution with the Freedom of the Press Act of 1766.

== Relationship to self-publishing ==
Freedom of the press is not construed as an absence of interference by outside entities, such as a government or religious organization, but rather as a right for authors to have their works published by other people. This idea was famously summarized by the 20th-century American journalist, A. J. Liebling, who wrote, &quot;Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one&quot;. Freedom of the press gives the printer or publisher exclusive control over what the publisher chooses to publish, including the right to refuse to print anything for any reason. If the author cannot reach a voluntary agreement with a publisher to produce the author&#x27;s work, then the author must turn to self-publishing.
==Status of press freedom worldwide==

Beyond legal definitions, several non-governmental organizations use other criteria to judge the level of press freedom worldwide. Some create subjective lists, while others are based on quantitative data:
* Reporters Without Borders considers the number of journalists murdered, expelled, or harassed, the existence of a state monopoly on TV and radio, as well as the existence of censorship and self-censorship in the media, and the overall independence of media as well as the difficulties that foreign reporters may face to rank countries in levels of press freedom.
* The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) systematically tracks the number of journalists killed and imprisoned in reprisal for their work. It says it uses the tools of journalism to help journalists by tracking press freedom issues through independent research, fact-finding missions, and a network of foreign correspondents, including local working journalists in countries worldwide. CPJ shares information on breaking cases with other press freedom organizations worldwide through the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of more than 119 free expression organizations. CPJ also tracks impunity in cases of journalist murders. CPJ staff applies strict criteria for each case; researchers independently investigate and verify the circumstances behind each death or imprisonment.
* Freedom House studies the more general political and economic environments of each nation in order to determine whether relationships of dependence exist that limit in practice the level of press freedom that might exist in theory. Panels of experts assess the press freedom score and draft each country summary according to a weighted scoring system that analyzes the political, economic, legal and safety situation for journalists based on a 100-point scale. It then categorizes countries as having a free, partly free, or not free press.

=== Annual report on journalists killed and Prison Census ===
Each year, The Committee to Protect Journalists produces a comprehensive list of all working journalists killed in relation to their employment, including profiles of each deceased journalist within an exhaustive database, and an annual census of incarcerated journalists (as of midnight, December 1). The year 2017 reported record findings of jailed journalists, reaching 262. Turkey, China, and Egypt account for more than half of all global journalists jailed.

As per a 2019 special report by the Committee to Protect Journalists, approximately 25 journalists were murdered on duty in 2019. The figure is claimed to be the lowest since 2002, a year in which at least 21 journalists were killed while they were reporting from the field. Meanwhile, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reported 49 killings, the lowest since 2003, when almost 36 journalists were killed. Leading press watchdogs fear persisting danger for the life of journalists. The drop in the murder of in-field journalists came across during the &quot;global attention on the issue of impunity in journalist murders&quot;, focusing on the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 and Daphne Caruana Galizia, a Maltese blogger in October 2017.
Every year, Reporters Without Borders establishes a subjective ranking of countries in terms of their freedom of the press. The Press Freedom Index list is based on responses to surveys sent to journalists that are members of partner organizations of the RWB, as well as related specialists such as researchers, jurists, and human rights activists. The survey asks questions about direct attacks on journalists and the media and other indirect sources of pressure against the free press, such as non-governmental groups.

In 2022, the eight countries with the most press freedom are, in order: Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Portugal, and Costa Rica. The ten countries with the least press freedom are, in order: North Korea, Eritrea, Iran, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, China, Vietnam, Cuba, Iraq, and Syria.

===&quot;Freedom of the Press&quot;===

&quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; is a yearly report by the US-based non-profit organization Freedom House. It is known to subjectively measure the level of freedom and editorial independence that is enjoyed by the press in every nation and significant disputed territories around the world. Levels of freedom are scored on a scale from 1 (most free) to 100 (least free). Depending on the basics, the nations are then classified in three types:
1. &quot;Free&quot; 
2. &quot;Partly Free&quot;
3. &quot;Not Free&quot;.

=== Democratic states ===
A free and independent press has been theorized to be a key mechanism of a functioning, healthy democracy. In the absence of censorship, journalism exists as a watchdog of private and government action, providing information to maintain an informed citizenry of voters. In this perspective, &quot;government efforts to influence published or broadcasted news content, either via media control or by inducing self-censorship, represent a threat to the access of important and necessary information to the public and affect the quality of democracy&quot;. An independent press &quot;serves to increase political knowledge, participation, and voter turnout&quot;, acting as an essential driver of civic participation.

===Non-democratic states===

Turkey, China, Egypt, Eritrea, and Saudi Arabia accounted for 70% of all journalists that were imprisoned in 2018. CPJ reported that &quot;After China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, the worst jailers are Eritrea, Vietnam, and Iran.&quot;

According to Reporters Without Borders, more than a third of the world&#x27;s people live in countries where there is no press freedom. Overwhelmingly, these people live in countries where there is no system of democracy or where there are serious deficiencies in the democratic process. 

Freedom of the press is an extremely problematic problem/concept for most non-democratic systems of government since, in the modern age, strict control of access to information is critical to the existence of most non-democratic governments and their associated control systems and security apparatus. To this end, most non-democratic societies employ state-run news organizations to promote the propaganda critical to maintaining an existing political power base and suppress (often very brutally, through the use of police, military, or intelligence agencies) any significant attempts by the media or individual journalists to challenge the approved &quot;government line&quot; on contentious issues. In such countries, journalists operating on the fringes of what is deemed to be acceptable will very often find themselves the subject of considerable intimidation by agents of the state. This can range from simple threats to their professional careers (firing, professional blacklisting) to death threats, kidnapping, torture, and assassination.
* The Lira Baysetova case in Kazakhstan.
* The Georgiy R. Gongadze case in Ukraine
* In Nepal, Eritrea, and mainland China, journalists may spend years in jail simply for using the &quot;wrong&quot; word or photo.

==History==

===Europe===

Central, Northern, and Western Europe have a long tradition of freedom of speech, including freedom of the press, which yet exists in the XVIII century and in the XIX century.

After World War II, Hugh Baillie, the president of the United Press wire service based in the U.S., promoted freedom of news dissemination. In 1944, he called for an open system of news sources and transmission, and a minimum of government regulation of the news. His proposals were aired at the Geneva Conference on Freedom of Information in 1948 but were blocked by the Soviets and the French.

Since 1950, the European Convention on Human Rights includes &quot;Article 10&quot; related to Freedom of expression which applies to Member states of the Council of Europe.

Media freedom is a fundamental right that applies to all member states of the European Union and its citizens, as defined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (since 2000) as well as the European Convention on Human Rights (since 1950). Within the EU enlargement process, guaranteeing media freedom is named a &quot;key indicator of a country&#x27;s readiness to become part of the EU&quot;.

====United Kingdom====
According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Britain has a long tradition of a free, inquisitive press&quot;, but &quot;[u]nlike the United States, Britain has no constitutional guarantee of press freedom.&quot; Freedom of the press was established in Great Britain in 1695, with Alan Rusbridger, former editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating: &quot;When people talk about licensing journalists or newspapers the instinct should be to refer them to history. Read about how licensing of the press in Britain was abolished in 1695. Remember how the freedoms won here became a model for much of the rest of the world, and be conscious of how the world still watches us to see how we protect those freedoms.&quot;
Until 1694, Great Britain had an elaborate system of licensing; the most recent was seen in the Licensing of the Press Act, 1662. No publication was allowed without the accompaniment of a government-granted license. Fifty years earlier, at a time of civil war, John Milton wrote his pamphlet &quot;Areopagitica&quot; (1644). In this work Milton argued forcefully against this form of government censorship and parodied the idea, writing &quot;when as debtors and delinquents may walk abroad without a keeper, but inoffensive books must not stir forth without a visible jailer in their title.&quot; Although at the time it did little to halt the practice of licensing, it would be viewed later a significant milestone as one of the most eloquent defenses of press freedom.

Milton&#x27;s central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason and distinguishing right from wrong, and good from bad. In order to be able to exercise this ration right, the individual must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in &quot;a free and open encounter.&quot; Milton&#x27;s writings developed the concept of the open marketplace of ideas, the idea that when people argue against each other, good arguments will prevail. One form of speech that was widely restricted in Great Britain was seditious libel, and laws were in place that made criticizing the government a crime. The king was above public criticism and statements critical of the government were forbidden, according to the English court of the Star Chamber. The truth was not a defense to seditious libel because the goal was to prevent and punish all condemnation of the government.

Locke contributed to the lapse of the Licensing Act in 1695, whereupon the press needed no license. Still, some libels were tried throughout the 18th century, until &quot;the Society of the Bill of Rights&quot; led by John Horne Tooke and John Wilkes organized a campaign to publish Parliamentary Debates. This culminated in three defeats of the Crown in the 1770 cases of Almon, Miller and Woodfall, who all had published one of the Letters of Junius, and the unsuccessful arrest of John Wheble in 1771. Thereafter the Crown was much more careful in the application of libel; for example, in the aftermath of the Peterloo Massacre, Burdett was convicted, whereas by contrast, the Junius affair was over a satire and sarcasm about the non-lethal conduct and policies of the government.

In Britain&#x27;s American colonies, the first editors discovered their readers enjoyed it when they criticised the local governor; the governors discovered they could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought John Peter Zenger to trial for criminal libel after the publication of satirical attacks. The defense lawyers argued that according to English common law, the truth was a valid defense against libel. The jury acquitted Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press. The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies, and the satirical attack on the government became common features in American newspapers.

In the Victorian era, the press became more influential than it had been previously, to the dismay of some readers. Thomas Carlyle, in his essay &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; (1829), said that the &quot;true Church of England, at this moment, lies in the Editors of its Newspapers. These preach to the people daily, weekly; admonishing kings themselves; advising peace or war, with an authority which only the first Reformers, and a long-past class of Popes, were possessed of&quot;. Similarly, Charles Dickens, in his &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; (1837), caricatured the newspapers as but the &quot;chosen organ and representative&quot; of either the Whigs or the Tories, and that they were &quot;essentially and indispensably necessary&quot; to the parties&#x27; operations.

John Stuart Mill in 1869 in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot; approached the problem of authority versus liberty from the viewpoint of a 19th-century utilitarian: The individual has the right of expressing himself so long as he does not harm other individuals. The good society is one in which the greatest number of persons enjoy the greatest possible amount of happiness. Applying these general principles of liberty to freedom of expression, Mill states that if we silence an opinion, we may silence the truth. The individual freedom of expression is therefore essential to the well-being of society. Mill wrote:
:If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and one, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.

The December 1817 Trials of writer and satirist William Hone for publishing three political pamphlets is considered a landmark in the fight for a free press.

====Denmark–Norway====
Between September 4, 1770 and October 7, 1771 the kingdom of Denmark–Norway had the most unrestricted freedom of press of any country in Europe. This occurred during the regime of Johann Friedrich Struensee, whose second act was to abolish the old censorship laws. However, due to the great amount of mostly anonymous pamphlets published that was critical and often slanderous towards Struensee&#x27;s own regime, he reinstated some restrictions regarding the freedom of press a year later, October 7, 1771.

====Italy====
After the Italian unification in 1861, the Albertine Statute of 1848 was adopted as the constitution of the Kingdom of Italy. The Statute granted the freedom of the press with some restrictions in case of abuses and in religious matters, as stated in Article 28:

After the abolition of the monarchy in 1946 and the abrogation of the Statute in 1948, the Constitution of the Republic of Italy guarantees the freedom of the press, as stated in Article 21, Paragraphs 2 and 3:

The Constitution allows the warrantless confiscation of periodicals in cases of absolute urgency, when the Judiciary cannot timely intervene, on the condition that a judicial validation must be obtained within 24 hours. Article 21 also gives restrictions against those publications considered offensive by public morality, as stated in Paragraph 6:

====Nazi Germany (1933–1945)====

In 1933, freedom of the press was suppressed in Nazi Germany by the Reichstag Fire Decree of President Paul von Hindenburg, just as Adolf Hitler was coming to power. Hitler suppressed freedom of the press through Joseph Goebbels&#x27; Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. The Ministry acted as a central control point for all media, issuing orders as to what stories could be run and what stories would be suppressed. Anyone involved in the film industry, from directors to the lowliest assistant, had to sign an oath of loyalty to the Nazi Party due to the opinion-changing power Goebbels perceived movies to have; Goebbels himself maintained some personal control over every single film made in Nazi Europe. Journalists who crossed the Propaganda Ministry were routinely imprisoned.

====Sweden====
One of the world&#x27;s first freedom of the press acts was introduced in Sweden in 1766 (Swedish Freedom of the Press Act), due in part to classical liberal member of parliament, Ostrobothnian priest, Anders Chydenius. Excepted and liable to prosecution was only vocal opposition to the king and the Church of Sweden. The act was largely rolled back after King Gustav&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in 1772, restored after the overthrowing of his son, Gustav IV of Sweden in 1809, and fully recognized with the abolition of the king&#x27;s prerogative to cancel licenses in the 1840s.

====Russia====
The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, criticized Russia for limiting the activities of VOA and Radio Free Europe in Russia with a governmental order demanding reviewing the subject by Moscow. 

On 4 March 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill introducing prison sentences of up to 15 years for those who publish &quot;knowingly false information&quot; about the Russian military and its operations in Ukraine, forcing independent media in Russia to stop reporting on Ukraine or cease operations. At least 1,000 Russian journalists have fled Russia since February 2022. About 85% of Russians get most of their information from Russian state-controlled media. 

&quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov was awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for his &quot;efforts to safeguard freedom of expression&quot;. In March 2022, &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; suspended its print activities after receiving a second warning from the Russian censorship apparatus &quot;Roskomnadzor&quot;. 

On 17 June 2024, a Moscow court issued arrest warrants for &quot;IStories&quot; editor-in-chief and award-winning investigative reporter Roman Anin and Ekaterina Fomina, a journalist at &quot;TV Rain&quot; and a former &quot;IStories&quot; correspondent, on charges of disseminating &quot;false information&quot; about the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. Russia&#x27;s Interior Ministry added two Russian journalists in exile to its wanted list. Fomina said the arrest warrant would affect her professional life as she would not be able to travel to many countries that could arrest her and extradite her to Russia.

====Romania====

Until 1989, Romania was part of the communist bloc as the Socialist Republic of Romania. The communist regime heavily restricted freedom of the press and other civil liberties. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, though available to the Romanian citizenry, was highly illegal and severe repercussions for existed for listening. 
Directly following the Romanian Revolution, post-communist corruption was largely the subject of investigative reports. At the same time, widespread violence against journalists began. During the June 1990 Mineriad, a series of protests against the National Salvation Front, counter-demonstrators assaulted reporting journalists. 

In 1992, President Ion Iliescu had a nervous meltdown when called journalist Paul Pârvu asked him if he felt guilt over Romanian deaths during the revolution. During the exchange, Iliescu referred to Pârvu as an &quot;animal&quot;.

Modern, major media outlets were founded during the mid-1990s, such as Antena 1 in 1994 and ProTV in 1995.

In 1999, the editor of a &quot;Ora&quot;, a local newspaper, Tiberiu Patru, was arrested before being able to publish an investigation of corruption in Dolj County under. In response, &quot;Ora&quot; moved its newsroom in front of the National Theater of Craiova to protest Patru&#x27;s arrest.

The 2000s saw the creation of many new media outlets across television, radio, and the traditional press. 

In 2023, Reporters Without Borders identified safety as a concern for Romanian journalists.

====Turkey====
More than 120 journalists remained in prison in Turkey in 2019, making it the most prolific incarcerator of journalists in the world.

In some countries, including Turkey, journalists were threatened or arrested for their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Americas===

====United States====

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution states:
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

====Canada====
Section 2(b) of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; states that everyone has &quot;the freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication.&quot;

The open court principle ensures the freedom of the press by requiring that court proceedings presumptively be open and accessible to the public and to the media.

====Mexico====

===Asia===
====Bahrain ====
According to Reporters without Borders, a number of reporters in Bahrain were jailed. Some were also tortured or were exiled.

====Iran====
According to the reports of the RSF in 2007, the freedom of Press in Iran ranked 166 among 169 states. The report reads the Iranian journalists face the &quot;extreme harsh behavior of the Iranian regime that prevents them criticizing authorities or expressing political and social demands.

After shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner, the agents of the Iranian Intelligence Service raided the houses and offices of many Iranian journalists seeking for their PCs, cell phones, books, and documents. These journalists had revealed the lies of the Iranian regime. Some of the journalists received warnings by the authorities and were forced to shut down their accounts in Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.

Demanding promotion of the global Freedom of Media, in December 1993, UNESCO called the 3rd of April as &quot;International day for Freedom of Media&quot;. This is while the RSF reported at least 860 journalists have been detained and imprisoned from 1979 to 2009 in Iran.

On April 21, 2020, Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in its annual press freedom rankings that the pandemic was &quot;highlighting many crises&quot; already casting a shadow on press freedom, around the world, with authoritarian states including Iran suppressing details of the outbreak.

RSF accused Iran—in 173rd place—of censoring major coronavirus outbreaks.

On May 2, 2020, on the occasion of the 3rd of May, the International Day of Freedom of Press, in a statement, the Iranian Writer Association emphasized on the existence of censorships and violation of freedom of speech and its destructive impacts on the structure and vital foundation of the society. It reminded that during the past decades, the rulers in the country imprisoned more than 890 journalists and reporters, some of whom have been executed. The Iranian Writer Association expressed its regret, when Iran ranked 173 among 180 states due to freedom of speech.

On 7 February 2020, the International Federation of Journalists in a statement condemned &quot;raiding of Iranian Security Forces upon the houses of six Iranian journalists, holding the forces of &quot;IRGC&#x27;s Intelligence&quot; responsible for recent pressures on the journalists. The secretary-general of the federation, Anthony Blunker, said that intimidating and threatening journalists are unpleasant tools to silence the public opinion of the administration.

On November 26, 2019, the RSF condemned the pressure on families of reporters by the Iranian regime, saying Iran ranked 170 among 180 states regarding Freedom of Press in 2019.

In its 2019 annual report, the Committee to Protect Journalists found at least 250 journalists in jail in relation to their work and stated that the number of imprisoned journalists in Iran was 11, citing the crackdown on protests by the Iranian people over rising gasoline prices. The report named Eritrea, Vietnam and Iran as &quot;the worst prisons for journalists&quot; after China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

On September 8, 2020, Reporters Without Borders expressed concern about the continuing detention and repression of journalists in Iran and warned for the journalists and Reporters who have been arrested for their activities and subjected to harassment. &quot;The Human Rights Council must take more serious action to protect and defend journalists,&quot; said an official.

On Monday, November 9, 2020, Ralph Nestmeyer, Vice President of the German Section of the Pen Association, referred to the repressive methods of authoritarian regimes: &quot;Freedom of expression has declined in many parts of the world.&quot; He added that dictatorial regimes respond to any criticism with violence and imprisonment. This year the World Pen Association (Pen), will concentrate on the fate of writers in Iran, China, Turkey, Peru and Uganda.

Human Rights Watch condemned the punishment of the death penalty and demanded that it be prevented at all costs, following the December 12 execution of an Iranian dissident on vague charges. Rouhallah Zam, the founder of Telegram channel Amadnews, was allegedly detained when he was visiting Iran in October 2019. He was deported forcibly to Iran and convicted of vague national security charges, as per Human Rights Watch. Zam faced trial for his ‘activism’ after being deported to Iran. The Iranian Supreme Court confirmed his verdict on December 8 and the journalist was executed on December 12.

====Palestine====
In October 2019, the Palestinian Authority blocked 59 websites, claiming that they were critical of the government. These websites were both Palestinian and Arabic and were identified to have been publishing material that &quot;threaten national security and civil peace.&quot; Quds News Network, among the blocked sites, stated that the move reflected the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s repression of the press.

====China====

Critics argue that the Communist Party in China has failed to live up to its promises about the freedom of the mainland Chinese media. Freedom House consistently ranks China as &#x27;Not Free&#x27; in its annual press freedom survey, including the 2014 report. PRC journalist He Qinglian says that the PRC&#x27;s media are controlled by directives from the Communist Party&#x27;s propaganda department and are subjected to intense monitoring which threatens punishment for violators, rather than to pre-publication censorship. In 2008, ITV News reporter John Ray was arrested while covering a &#x27;Free Tibet&#x27; protest. International media coverage of Tibetan protests only a few months before the Beijing Olympics in 2008 triggered a strong reaction inside China. Chinese media practitioners took the opportunity to argue with propaganda authorities for more media freedom: one journalist asked, &#x27;If not even Chinese journalists are allowed to report about the problems in Tibet, how can foreign journalists know about the Chinese perspective about the events?&#x27; Foreign journalists also reported that their access to certain websites, including those of human rights organizations, was restricted. 

International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge stated at the end of the 2008 Olympic Games that &quot;The regulations [governing foreign media freedom during the Olympics] might not be perfect but they are a sea-change compared to the situation before. We hope that they will continue.&quot; The Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC) issued a statement during the Olympics that &#x27;despite welcome progress in terms of accessibility and the number of press conferences within the Olympic facilities, the FCCC has been alarmed at the use of violence, intimidation and harassment outside. The club has confirmed more than 30 cases of reporting interference since the formal opening of the Olympic media centre on 25 July, and is checking at least 20 other reported incidents.&#x27;

Since the Chinese state continues to exert a considerable amount of control over media, public support for domestic reporting has come as a surprise to many observers. Not much is known about the extent to which the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CPC, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused on the changing relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China&#x27;s changing media environment has affected the government&#x27;s ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it.

In 2012 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Chinese government to lift restrictions on media access to the region and allow independent and impartial monitors to visit and assess conditions in Tibet. The Chinese government did not change its position.

====Pakistan====

Article 19 of the constitution of the Pakistan states that: &quot;Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defense of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, commission of or incitement to an offence.&quot; Since independence the electronic media in Pakistan remained dominated by the state-run Pakistan Television and Pakistan Broadcasting CorporationsIronically, press freedom in Pakistan flourished for the first time in 2002 during Gen R Prevaiz Musharraf&#x27;s era. 

To a large extent the media enjoys freedom of expression in spite of political pressure and direct bans sometimes administered by political stake holders. Political pressure on media is mostly done indirectly. One tool widely used by the government is to cut off &#x27;unfriendly&#x27; media from governmental advertising. Using draconian laws, the government has also banned or officially silenced popular television channels. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) has been used to silence the broadcast media by either suspending licenses or by simply threatening to do so. In addition, media is also threatened by non-state actors involved in the current conflict.

In its 2018 Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan number 139 out of 180 countries based on freedom of the press. The report implied considerable improvement in the freedom of press compared to the preceding years.

====Malaysia====
The press in Malaysia is controlled and journalists cannot have a conversation about certain things. For instance, a British reporter in Malaysia was arrested after she reported on the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal and published details of the alleged transfer of $681 million from 1MDB to bank accounts held by Najib Razak.

====Singapore====
Singapore&#x27;s media environment is considered to be controlled by the government.

====Saudi Arabia====

Saudi Arabia does not tolerate dissidents and it can impose penalties on such people. Saudi Arabia is also responsible for executing Saudi American journalist, Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. As he entered a Saudi embassy in Turkey, a group of Saudi assassins killed him.
====India====

The Indian Constitution, while not mentioning the word &quot;press&quot;, provides for &quot;the right to freedom of speech and expression&quot; (Article 19(1) a). However, this right is subject to restrictions under sub clause, whereby this freedom can be restricted for reasons of &quot;sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, preserving decency, preserving morality, in relation to contempt, court, defamation, or incitement to an offense&quot;. Laws such as the Official Secrets Act and Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act
(PoTA) have been used to limit press freedom. Under PoTA, person could be detained for up to six months for being in contact with a terrorist or terrorist group. PoTA was repealed in 2006, but the Official Secrets Act 1923 continues.

For the first half-century of independence, media control by the state was the major constraint on press freedom. Indira Gandhi famously stated in 1975 that All India Radio is &quot;a Government organ, it is going to remain a Government organ...&quot;
With the liberalization starting in the 1990s, private control of media has burgeoned, leading to increasing independence and greater scrutiny of government.

It ranks poorly at 142nd rank out of 180 listed countries in the Press Freedom Index 2021 released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Analytically India&#x27;s press freedom, as could be deduced by the Press Freedom Index, has constantly reduced since 2002, when it culminated in terms of apparent freedom, achieving a rank of 80 among the reported countries. In 2018, India&#x27;s freedom of press ranking declined two placed to 138. In explaining the decline, RSF cited growing intolerance from Hindu nationalist supporters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the murders of journalists such as Gauri Lankesh.

====Bangladesh====

Bangladeshi media is reportedly following self-censorship due to the controversial Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act. Under this act, 25 journalists and several hundred bloggers and Facebook users are reportedly prosecuted in Bangladesh in 2017.

Bangladesh ranks poorly at 146th rank out of 180 listed countries in the Press Freedom Index 2018 released by Reporters Without Borders (RWB). Bangladeshi media has faced many problems in 2018. The country&#x27;s most popular online newspaper bdnews24.com was blocked for a few hours on June 18, 2018, by Bangladesh&#x27;s regulatory authority. Another newspaper &quot;The Daily Star&quot; website was blocked for 22 hours on June 2, 2018, after it had published a report about a victim of an extrajudicial execution in the southeastern city of Cox&#x27;s Bazar.

During the road-safety protests in 2018, Bangladeshi government switched off 3G and 4G mobile data and also arrested a photographer named Shahidul Alam under ICT act, after he had given an interview with Al Jazeera.

===Africa===

====Tanzania====
As of 2018, online content providers must be licensed and pay an annual fee to the government.

====South Africa====
Following the transition to democracy in 1994, the post-apartheid Constitution of South Africa guarantees the freedom of the press.

==Implications of new technologies==
Many of the traditional means of delivering information are being slowly superseded by the increasing pace of modern technological advance. Almost every conventional mode of media and information dissemination has a modern counterpart that offers significant potential advantages to journalists seeking to maintain and enhance their freedom of speech. A few simple examples of such phenomena include:
* Satellite television versus terrestrial television: Whilst terrestrial television is relatively easy to manage and manipulate, satellite television is much more difficult to control as journalistic content can easily be broadcast from other jurisdictions beyond the control of individual governments. An example of this in the Middle East is the satellite broadcaster Al Jazeera. This Arabic-language media channel operates out of Qatar, whose government is relatively liberal compared to many of its neighboring states. As such, its views and content are often problematic to a number of governments in the region and beyond. However, because of the increased affordability and miniaturisation of satellite technology (e.g., dishes and receivers) it is simply not practicable for most states to control popular access to the channel.
* Internet-based publishing (e.g., blogging, social media) vs. traditional publishing: Traditional magazines and newspapers rely on physical resources (e.g., offices, printing presses) that can easily be targeted and forced to close down. Internet-based publishing systems can be run using ubiquitous and inexpensive equipment and can operate from any global jurisdiction. Nations and organisations are increasingly resorting to legal measures to take control of online publications, using national security, anti-terror measures and copyright laws to issue takedown notices and restrict opposition speech.
* Internet, anonymity software and strong cryptography: In addition to Internet-based publishing, the Internet (in combination with anonymity software such as Tor and cryptography) allows for sources to remain anonymous and sustain confidentiality while delivering information to or securely communicating with journalists anywhere in the world in an instant (e.g. SecureDrop, WikiLeaks).
* Voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) vs. conventional telephony: Although conventional telephony systems are easily tapped and recorded, modern VOIP technology can employ low-cost strong cryptography to evade surveillance. As VOIP and similar technologies become more widespread they are likely to make the effective monitoring of journalists (and their contacts and activities) a very difficult task for governments.

Governments are responding to the challenges posed by new media technologies by deploying increasingly sophisticated technology of their own (a notable example being China&#x27;s attempts to impose control through a state-run internet service provider that controls access to the Internet).

== World ranking ==
=== World ranking 2023 ===
In its 2023 report published on May 3, Reporters Without Borders evaluated the state of media freedom in 180 countries. According to this report, the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran ranks 177 out of 180 countries after North Korea, China and Vietnam, and it has also been named as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists.

=== World ranking 2021 ===
The World Press Freedom Index 2021, compiled by Reporters Without Borders, shows that journalism is completely blocked or severely restricted in 73 countries and restricted in 59 others. According to the report, Norway ranks first among 180 countries for the fifth year in a row. Finland is second and Sweden third. In this index, Iran is ranked 174th with a decline. Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria ranked consequently 150th, 177th, 170th, 166th and 173rd.

=== World ranking 2020 ===
On April 21, the RSF in its 2020 annual report published the latest ranking of Freedom of Media. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the 173rd in the list, declining three steps compared to 2019. The three Iranian allied countries, Syria, China, and North Korea are 174th, 177th, and 180th. This organization accuses China and Iran of censorship of news about an outbreak of coronavirus.

=== World ranking 2019 ===
On April 18, the RSF published its annual report, Indication for Free Media in the world. In this report, among 180 states, Norway was the freest and safest country in the world. Finland and Sweden are the next. Meanwhile, Iran lost its position in the list- compare to 2018- and is among the 11 countries that suppress the freedom of the media. Iran is on the bottom of the list, ranked as the 170th state.

=== World ranking 2018 ===
The RSF in its annual report in 2018 documented deadly violence and misbehavior against reporters saying for one year 80 reporters have been killed, 348 detained, and 60 taken hostage which indicates an unprecedented hostility against media staff. This organization recognizes Iran as one of the five states which is called &quot;prison of reporters&quot; along with China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey. Based on this report Iran is ranked 144th and is still one of the greatest prisons for journalists.

=== World ranking 2017 ===
Based on the 2017 annual report on RSF, Iran along with China, Turkey, Vietnam, and Syria are the largest prison for reporters and media activists. The report says during 2017, among professional journalists, 50 have been killed and 326 detained; 54 reporters have been taken hostage.

=== World ranking 2016 ===
On December 13, 2016, the Reporters without Borders (RSF) published its annual report. The report reads: 348 journalists have been detained and 52 taken hostage in Iran in 2016. Following Turkey, the countries China, Syria, Egypt, and Iran have almost two-thirds of detained journalists.
=== World ranking 2015 ===
On February 12, 2015, the Reporters without Borders (RSF) published its annual report. In this report, 180 states have been reviewed based on the freedom of press, independent media and also the situation of reporters and journalists. Iran is at the 173rd of this list that indicates, despite the Rouhani&#x27;s promises, freedom of speeches and journalists has not been improved; the RSF concerns continue. According to the report, Iran ranked third on the list on the imprisonment of journalists.

<doc id="105324" wikidata="Q5036720" url="?curid=105324" title="Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters">
<text>Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters is a 1974 satirical concept album by Robert Calvert, the former frontman of British space-rock band Hawkwind. It consists of a mixture of songs and comic spoken interludes.

The concept was based on the German Air Ministry&#x27;s purchase of the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter, which was eventually nicknamed &quot;Widowmaker&quot; by Luftwaffe pilots. In German service these planes had a poor safety record, with 262 out of 916 Luftwaffe Starfighters lost in accidents during the aircraft&#x27;s time in service, which lasted from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s. 

Although rarely commented upon specifically. The album&#x27;s focus was upon the irony of organisational dysfunction due to political decision-making based on the unfounded and biased assumptions of the politicians in charge. This situation, seen repeating itself to this day, includes assumptions such as that the plane they were ordering, could ever do, what they decided to believe it could do. 

This scenario is given the entirely realistic &quot;double twist&quot;, of Lockheed&#x27;s own sales-focussed intermediaries, also failing to challenge their own overoptimistic assumption that their engineers could do anything that was required, at a cost that could be afforded. When the pilots found the final plane uncontrollable and started dying, the response, according to Calvert, was to increasingly add cocktails of drugs to the pilot&#x27;s &quot;pre-take-off-final-cockpit-check&quot;. 110 pilots died before the project was finally mothballed.

Musicians who appeared on the album include members of Hawkwind, The Pink Fairies, Brian Eno (although not credited as Eno), Arthur Brown and Adrian Wagner. The spoken sketches are primarily performed by Calvert, Viv Stanshall and Jim Capaldi.

&quot;Ejection&quot; (coupled with &quot;Catch a Falling Starfighter&quot;) was released as a single, although both songs are slightly different versions to those on the album. &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Song&quot; was included in the libretto and Calvert had hoped to record it with Nico singing. It wasn&#x27;t recorded at the time but it was eventually recorded in 1984 with Calvert&#x27;s wife Jill Riches on lead vocals and included on the &quot;Hawkwind, Friends and Relations&quot; Vol.3 compilation.

The album has been re-released in the late 1990s by BGO Records and is currently available on Eclectic Records (ECLCD1056) with bonus tracks.

<text>Hemerythrin (also spelled haemerythrin; , ) is an oligomeric protein responsible for oxygen (O2) transport in the marine invertebrate phyla of sipunculids, priapulids, brachiopods, and in a single annelid worm genus, &quot;Magelona&quot;. Myohemerythrin is a monomeric O2-binding protein found in the muscles of marine invertebrates. Hemerythrin and myohemerythrin are essentially colorless when deoxygenated, but turn a violet-pink in the oxygenated state.

Hemerythrin does not, as the name might suggest, contain a heme. The names of the blood oxygen transporters hemoglobin, hemocyanin, and hemerythrin do not refer to the heme group (only found in globins). Instead, these names are derived from the Greek word for blood. Hemerythrin may also contribute to innate immunity and anterior tissue regeneration in certain worms.

==O2 binding mechanism==
The mechanism of dioxygen binding is unusual. Most O2 carriers operate via formation of dioxygen complexes, but hemerythrin holds the O2 as a hydroperoxide (HO2, or -OOH−). The site that binds O2 consists of a pair of iron centres. The iron atoms are bound to the protein through the carboxylate side chains of a glutamate and aspartates as well as through five histidine residues. Hemerythrin and myohemerythrin are often described according to oxidation and ligation states of the iron center:

The uptake of O2 by hemerythrin is accompanied by two-electron oxidation of the diferrous centre to produce a hydroperoxide (OOH−) complex. The binding of O2 is roughly described in this diagram:

Deoxyhemerythrin contains two high-spin ferrous ions bridged by hydroxyl group (A). One iron is hexacoordinate and another is pentacoordinate. A hydroxyl group serves as a bridging ligand but also functions as a proton donor to the O2 substrate. This proton-transfer result in the formation of a single oxygen atom (μ-oxo) bridge in oxy- and methemerythrin. O2 binds to the pentacoordinate Fe2+ centre at the vacant coordination site (B). Then electrons are transferred from the ferrous ions to generate the binuclear ferric (Fe3+,Fe3+) centre with bound peroxide (C).

==Quaternary structure and cooperativity==

Hemerythrin typically exists as a homooctamer or heterooctamer composed of α- and β-type subunits of 13–14 kDa each, although some species have dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric hemerythrins. Each subunit has a four-α-helix fold binding a binuclear iron centre. Because of its size hemerythrin is usually found in cells or &quot;corpuscles&quot; in the blood rather than free floating.

Unlike hemoglobin, most hemerythrins lack cooperative binding to oxygen, making it roughly 1/4 as efficient as hemoglobin. In some brachiopods though, hemerythrin shows cooperative binding of O2. Cooperative binding is achieved by interactions between subunits: the oxygenation of one subunit increases the affinity of a second unit for oxygen.

Hemerythrin affinity for carbon monoxide (CO) is actually lower than its affinity for O2, unlike hemoglobin which has a very high affinity for CO. Hemerythrin&#x27;s low affinity for CO poisoning reflects the role of hydrogen-bonding in the binding of O2, a pathway mode that is incompatible with CO complexes which usually do not engage in hydrogen bonding.

==Hemerythrin/HHE cation-binding domain==
The hemerythrin/HHE cation-binding domain occurs as a duplicated domain in hemerythrins, myohemerythrins and related proteins. This domain binds iron in hemerythrin, but can bind other metals in related proteins, such as cadmium in the &quot;Nereis diversicolor&quot; hemerythrin. It is also found in the NorA protein from &quot;Cupriavidus necator&quot;, this protein is a regulator of response to nitric oxide, which suggests a different set-up for its metal ligands. A protein from &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; (Filobasidiella neoformans) that contains haemerythrin/HHE cation-binding domains is also involved in nitric oxide response. A &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; protein containing this domain, iron-sulfur cluster repair protein ScdA, has been noted to be important when the organism switches to living in environments with low oxygen concentrations; perhaps this protein acts as an oxygen store or scavenger.

Hemerythrin/HHE (H-HxxxE-HxxxH-HxxxxD) proteins found in bacteria are implicated in signal transduction and chemotaxis. More distantly related ones include H-HxxxE-H-HxxxE proteins (including the E3 ligase) and animal F-box proteins (H-HExxE-H-HxxxE).
