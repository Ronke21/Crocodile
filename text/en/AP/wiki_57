<text>Robert Anthony Plant (born 20 August 1948) is an English singer and songwriter. He was the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band Led Zeppelin from its founding in 1968 until their breakup in 1980. Since then, he has had a successful solo career, sometimes collaborating with other artists such as Alison Krauss. Regarded by many as one of the greatest singers in rock music, he is known for his flamboyant persona, raw stage performances and his powerful, wide-ranging voice.

Plant was born and raised in the West Midlands area of England, where, after leaving grammar school, he briefly trained as a chartered accountant before leaving home at 16 years old to concentrate on singing with a series of local blues bands, including Band of Joy with John Bonham. In 1968, he was invited by Peter Grant and Jimmy Page to join The Yardbirds, which Grant and Page were attempting to keep going after it had broken up (a breakup that became public knowledge by early July at the latest). The new version of The Yardbirds changed their name to Led Zeppelin, and from the late 1960s to the end of the 1970s, the band enjoyed considerable success.

Plant developed a compelling image as a charismatic rock-and-roll frontman, comparable to other &#x27;70s contemporaries such as Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Roger Daltrey of the Who, and Jim Morrison of the Doors. After Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant continued to perform and record continuously on a variety of solo and group projects. His first two solo albums, &quot;Pictures at Eleven&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Principle of Moments&quot; (1983), each reached the top ten on the Billboard albums chart. With his band The Honeydrippers he scored a top-ten single hit with a remake of &quot;Sea of Love&quot;, which featured former Led Zeppelin bandmate Jimmy Page on guitar. Solo album &quot;Now and Zen&quot; (1988) was certified 3× Platinum and is Plant&#x27;s biggest-selling solo album to date. In the 1990s, another reunion project called Page and Plant released two albums and earned a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1998 for &quot;Most High&quot;. In 2007, Plant began a collaboration with bluegrass artist Alison Krauss, releasing the album &quot;Raising Sand&quot;, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2009 and produced the hit song &quot;Please Read the Letter&quot;, which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year the same year. In 2010, he revived the Band of Joy (which shared its name with an early band he performed with in the 1960s), and in 2012 formed a new band, the Sensational Space Shifters, followed by a reunion with Alison Krauss in 2019.

In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Plant as one of the 100 best singers of all time (2008); and he was the top pick for the greatest lead singer in a 2011 readers&#x27; poll. &quot;Hit Parader&quot; named Plant the &quot;Greatest Metal Vocalist of All Time&quot; (2006). Plant was named one of the 50 Great Voices by NPR. In 2009, Plant was voted &quot;the greatest voice in rock&quot; in a poll conducted by UK classic rock radio station Planet Rock. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked him number 4 on their list of The 50 Greatest Rock Lead Singers of All Time (2023).

==Early life and musical beginnings==
Robert Anthony Plant was born on 20 August 1948, in the Black Country town of West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England, to Robert C. Plant, a qualified civil engineer who worked in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, and Annie Celia Plant (née Cain), a Romani woman. He grew up in the Hayley Green area of Halesowen, Worcestershire. Plant gained an interest in singing and rock and roll music at an early age; in an interview with Andrew Denton on the &quot;Denton&quot; talk show in 1994, Plant stated his desire, as a ten-year-old, to be like Elvis Presley:When I was a kid I used to hide behind the curtains at home at Christmas and I used to try and be Elvis. There was a certain ambience between the curtains and the French windows, there was a certain sound there for a ten-year-old. which was all the ambience I got at ten years old ... And I always wanted to be ... a bit similar to that.He left King Edward VI Grammar School for Boys in Stourbridge in his mid-teens and developed a strong passion for the blues, mainly through his admiration for Willie Dixon, Robert Johnson and early renditions of songs in this genre.

He abandoned training as a chartered accountant after only two weeks to attend college in an effort to gain more GCE passes and to become part of the English Midlands blues scene. &quot;I left home at 16,&quot; he said, &quot;and I started my real education musically, moving from group to group, furthering my knowledge of the blues and of other music which had weight and was worth listening to.&quot;

Plant&#x27;s early blues influences included Johnson, Bukka White, Skip James, Jerry Miller, and Sleepy John Estes. Plant had various jobs while pursuing his music career, one of which was working for the major British construction company Wimpey in Birmingham in 1967, laying tarmac on roads. He also worked at Woolworth&#x27;s in Halesowen town for a short period of time. He cut three obscure singles on CBS Records and sang with a variety of bands, including the Crawling King Snakes, which brought him into contact with drummer John Bonham. They both went on to play in the Band of Joy, merging blues with newer psychedelic trends.

==Led Zeppelin (1968–1980)==

===Early years===
In 1968, guitarist Jimmy Page was in search of a lead singer for his new band and met Plant after being turned down by his first choice, Terry Reid, who referred him to a show at a teacher training college in Birmingham (where Plant was singing in a band named Hobbstweedle). In front of Page, Plant sang Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, leading Page to end his search. As recalled by Plant and Page:


With a shared passion for music, Plant and Page immediately developed a strong relationship, and began their writing collaboration with reworkings of earlier blues songs.

Initially dubbed the &quot;New Yardbirds&quot; in 1968, the band soon came to be known as Led Zeppelin. The band&#x27;s eponymous debut album hit the charts in 1969 and is widely credited as a catalyst for the heavy metal genre. Plant has commented that it is unfair for people to think of Zeppelin as heavy metal, as almost a third of their music was acoustic.

In 1975, Plant and his wife Maureen (now divorced) were seriously injured in a car crash in Rhodes, Greece. This significantly affected the production of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s seventh album &quot;Presence&quot; for a few months while he recovered, and forced the band to cancel the remaining tour dates for the year.

In July 1977, his son Karac died at the age of five while Plant was on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s concert tour of the United States. Plant retreated to his home in the Midlands of England and, for months afterward, questioned his future.

===Lyrics===
Plant began writing song lyrics with Led Zeppelin during the making of &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;, in 1969. According to Jimmy Page:

Plant&#x27;s lyrics with Led Zeppelin were often mystical, philosophical and spiritual, alluding to events in classical and Norse mythology, such as &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, which refers to Valhalla and Viking conquests. However, the song &quot;No Quarter&quot; is often misunderstood to refer to the god Thor; the song actually refers to Mount Thor (which is named after the god). Another example is &quot;The Rain Song&quot;.

Plant was influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien, whose book series inspired lyrics in some early Led Zeppelin songs. Most notably, &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;, &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, &quot;No Quarter&quot;, &quot;Ramble On&quot; and &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; contain verses referencing Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Conversely, Plant sometimes used more straightforward blues themes dealing with sex, as in &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;, &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot; about giving in to sexual temptation, and &quot;Black Dog&quot; narrated by a man obsessed with a woman.

Welsh mythology forms a basis of Plant&#x27;s interest in mystical lyrics. He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to Snowdonia. Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as Black Book of Carmarthen, Book of Taliesin, etc.) Plant&#x27;s first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior Caratacus. The song &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; is named after the 18th-century Welsh cottage Bron-Yr-Aur, owned by a friend of his father; it later inspired the song &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot;. The songs &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot;, and early dabblings in what would become &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant&#x27;s mystical view of the land. Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant&#x27;s early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).

Page&#x27;s passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically Marrakesh in Morocco, where he encountered Umm Kulthum:

Both he and Jimmy Page revisited these influences during their reunion album &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot; in 1994. During his solo career Plant tapped into these influences many times, most notably on the 2002 album &quot;Dreamland&quot;.

Most of the lyrics of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; from &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; were written spontaneously by Plant in 1970 at Headley Grange while the track was being recorded. While never released as a single, the song has topped polls as the greatest song of all time.

===Stage persona===
Plant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the charismatic rock-and-roll front man, similar to his contemporaries the Who&#x27;s singer Roger Daltrey, Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, and Jim Morrison of the Doors. With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the &quot;god of rock and roll&quot; or &quot;rock god&quot; archetype. On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.

According to &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, &quot;once he had a couple of US tours under his belt, &quot;Percy&quot; Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin&#x27;s rapidly burgeoning appeal.&quot; In 1994, during his &quot;Unledded&quot; tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:

One of the oddest awards he received was the &quot;Rock Scene&quot; magazine &quot;Chest O Rama&quot;. Readers of the magazine had to decide who had the best chest in rock, and Plant was the winner. When they contacted him about it, he replied: &quot;I&#x27;m really greatly honoured although it&#x27;s hard for me to be eloquent on the subject of my chest.&quot;

==Solo career (1981–present)==

===Early solo career and success (1981–1993)===

After Led Zeppelin disbanded in December 1980 (following the death of drummer John Bonham), Plant briefly considered abandoning music to pursue a career as a teacher in the Rudolf Steiner education system, going so far as to be accepted for teacher training. He nevertheless embarked on a successful solo career, helped by encouragement from Genesis drummer Phil Collins, who would go on to play with him. Plant&#x27;s solo career began with the album &quot;Pictures at Eleven&quot; in 1982, followed by 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Principle of Moments&quot;. Popular tracks from this period include &quot;Big Log&quot; (a Top 20 hit in 1983), &quot;In the Mood&quot; (1983), &quot;Little by Little&quot; (from 1985&#x27;s &quot;Shaken &#x27;n&#x27; Stirred&quot;), &quot;Far Post&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Burning Down One Side&quot;), which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 movie &quot;White Nights&quot; starring Gregory Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov, and popularised by airplay on album-oriented rock stations), &quot;Tall Cool One&quot; (a No. 25 hit from 1988&#x27;s &quot;Now and Zen&quot;) and later &quot;I Believe&quot; (from 1993&#x27;s &quot;Fate of Nations&quot;). This last track, like Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;All My Love&quot;, was written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac. Whilst Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period (although he would occasionally improvise his unique Zeppelin screams into his set), his tours in 1983 (with Phil Collins on drums) and in 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues. In 1986 Plant performed at the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert with other famous Midlands musicians. 
During the late 1980s and early 1990s Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter Phil Johnstone. These were: &quot;Now and Zen&quot; in 1988, &quot;Manic Nirvana&quot; in 1990, and the 1993 &quot;Fate of Nations&quot; (which features Moya Brennan of Clannad and former Cutting Crew guitarist Kevin Scott MacMichael). Songs from this third album, plus a smattering of Led Zeppelin classics, made up the set-list for Plant&#x27;s acclaimed sunset performance on the Main Stage at Glastonbury Festival, in 1993. It was Johnstone who talked Plant into playing Led Zeppelin songs in his live shows, something Plant had always previously resisted, not wanting to be forever known as &quot;the former Led Zeppelin vocalist&quot;.

Although Led Zeppelin disbanded in 1980, Plant occasionally collaborated with Jimmy Page on various projects through this period, including forming a short-lived all-star group with Page and Jeff Beck in 1984, called the Honeydrippers. They released an EP called &quot;The Honeydrippers: Volume One&quot;, and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of the Phil Phillips&#x27; tune &quot;Sea of Love&quot;, plus a follow-up hit with a cover of Roy Brown&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; at Midnight&quot;. The pair again worked together in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort &quot;Outrider&quot;, and in the same year Page contributed to Plant&#x27;s album &quot;Now and Zen&quot;. Also, on 15 May 1988 Plant appeared with Page as a member of Led Zeppelin, at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert (where he also performed in his own right as a solo artist). Plant&#x27;s live collaborations with other well-known musicians continued when he took to the stage with Queen at Wembley Stadium, for 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert&quot; for AIDS Awareness; where he sang Queen&#x27;s &quot;Innuendo&quot; and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot;.

===Page and Plant (1994–1998)===
Page and Plant became a full-fledged performing act from 1994 through 1998, releasing the &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot; album in 1994 and following with an enormously successful tour in 1995, including a return to the Glastonbury Festival. Fourteen years of speculation from their fans and occasional sniping between the two former members ended when they reconvened their former musical partnership to produce &quot;No Quarter&quot;. Having long resisted offers from MTV to reform to do an &quot;Unplugged&quot; show, they finally accepted as part of a deal that also allowed them to visit Morocco to record new material. The album combines the results of both of these projects. The Led Zeppelin material features new arrangements and new instrumentation, including strings, Egyptian musicians and the vocals of British-Asian star Najma Akhtar.

Page and Plant recorded their only post-Zeppelin album of original material as the 1998 album &quot;Walking into Clarksdale&quot;, an effort that was unsuccessful commercially, leading Plant to return to his solo career after another world tour. A song from this album, &quot;Please Read the Letter&quot;, was re-recorded by Plant with Alison Krauss, and was featured on their 2007 album which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year.

=== Priory of Brion and reunion with Page (1999–2001) ===
Starting in mid-1999, Plant performed until the end of 2000 at several small venues with his folk-rock band, named Priory of Brion. This band consisted of the original Band of Joy guitarist Kevyn Gammond alongside Andy Edwards (drums), Paul Timothy (keyboards), and Paul Wetton (bass). The Priory of Brion played around one hundred concerts across Europe at various small clubs and festivals. The band performed cover versions of songs that had influenced Plant in his formative years. Many of these cover versions would crop up later on his &quot;Dreamland&quot; album.

In 1999, Plant contributed to the tribute album for Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence, who was terminally ill. The album, &quot;More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album&quot; (Birdman, 1999), with the album title referring to Spence&#x27;s only solo album, &quot;Oar&quot; (Columbia, 1969), contained Plant&#x27;s version of Spence&#x27;s &quot;Little Hands&quot;. Plant had been an admirer of Spence and Moby Grape since the release of Moby Grape&#x27;s eponymous 1967 debut album.

In 2001, Plant appeared on Afro Celt Sound System&#x27;s album &quot;Volume 3: Further in Time&quot;. The song &quot;Life Begin Again&quot; features a duet with Welsh folksinger Julie Murphy, emphasising Plant&#x27;s recurring interest in Welsh culture (Murphy would also tour in support of Plant).

In the summer of 2001, Plant reunited with Page for both a cover of &quot;My Bucket&#x27;s Got a Hole in It&quot; for a Sun Records tribute album and an appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, the last time they worked outside of Led Zeppelin together.

===Strange Sensation and further collaborations (2002–2009)===
In 2002, with his then newly formed band Strange Sensation, Plant released a widely acclaimed collection of mostly blues and folk remakes, &quot;Dreamland&quot;. Contrasting with this lush collection of often relatively obscure remakes, the second album with Strange Sensation, &quot;Mighty ReArranger&quot; (2005), contains new, original songs. Both have received some of the most favourable reviews of Plant&#x27;s solo career and four Grammy nominations, two in 2003 and two in 2006.

As a former member of Led Zeppelin, along with Page and John Paul Jones, Plant received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005 and the Polar Music Prize in 2006.

From 2001 to 2007, Plant actively toured the US and Europe with Strange Sensation. His sets typically included recent, but not only, solo material and plenty of Led Zeppelin favourites, often with new and expanded arrangements. A DVD titled &quot;Soundstage: Robert Plant and Strange Sensation&quot;, featuring his &quot;Soundstage&quot; performance (filmed at the Soundstage studios in Chicago on 16 September 2005), was released in October 2006.

With Strange Sensation&#x27;s Justin Adams he appeared at the 2003 &quot;Festival au Desert&quot; held in Essakane in the North of Mali, captured in a French-language documentary film entitled &quot;Le Festival au Désert&quot; (2004).

On 23 June 2006, Plant was the headliner (backed by Ian Hunter&#x27;s band) at the Benefit For Arthur Lee concert at New York&#x27;s Beacon Theatre, a show which raised money for Lee&#x27;s medical expenses from his bout with leukaemia. Plant and band performed thirteen songs – five by Arthur Lee &amp; Love, five Led Zeppelin songs and three others, including a duet with Ian Hunter. At the show, Plant told the audience of his great admiration for Arthur Lee dating back to the mid-&#x27;60s. Lee died of his illness six weeks after the concert.

An expansive box set of his solo work, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, was released in November 2006, which expanded all of his albums with various B-sides, demos, and live cuts. It was accompanied by a DVD. All his solo works were re-released with these extra tracks individually.

In 2007, Plant contributed two tracks to the Fats Domino tribute album &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot;, &quot;It Keeps Rainin with the Lil&#x27; Band o&#x27; Gold and &quot;Valley of Tears&quot; with the Soweto Gospel Choir.

Plant performed with Strange Sensation guitarist Justin Adams and the West African riti (a one-string violin) master Juldeh Camara for the finale of the three day World of Music, Arts and Dance Festival in Abu Dhabi. Approximately 50,000 attended each of the free Womad concerts, which took place on the Corniche public beach from 23–25 April 2009.

===Alison Krauss (2007–2009 &amp; 2021)===
In 2007 and 2008, Plant recorded and performed with bluegrass star Alison Krauss. A duet album, &quot;Raising Sand&quot;, was released on 23 October 2007 on Rounder Records. The album, recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and produced by T Bone Burnett, includes performances of lesser-known material from R&amp;B, blues, folk and country songwriters including Mel Tillis, Townes Van Zandt, Gene Clark, Tom Waits, Doc Watson, Little Milton and the Everly Brothers. In February 2008 the song &quot;Gone Gone Gone (Done Moved On)&quot; from &quot;Raising Sand&quot; won a Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 50th Grammy Awards. In February 2009 at the 51st Grammy Awards, &quot;Raising Sand&quot; won 5 Grammys, for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, and Contemporary Folk/Americana Album. The album has been successful critically and commercially, and was certified platinum on 4 March 2008. The album was also nominated for the Mercury Prize in July 2008.

Plant and Krauss began an extended tour of the US and Europe in April 2008, playing music from &quot;Raising Sand&quot; and other American roots music as well as reworked Led Zeppelin tunes. Also in 2008, Plant performed with bluegrass musicians at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival and Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival. He appeared as a surprise guest during Fairport Convention&#x27;s set at the 2008 Cropredy Festival, performing Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; with Kristina Donahue as a tribute to Sandy Denny.

In 2021, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss released the 12-track studio album &quot;Raise the Roof&quot;, produced by T Bone Burnett, as a follow-up to &quot;Raising Sand.&quot; Accompanying the album&#x27;s launch, Plant and Krauss performed a globally live-streamed set, broadcast from Nashville&#x27;s Sound Emporium Studios.

===Band of Joy (2010–2011)===
In July 2010, Plant embarked on a twelve-date summer tour in the United States with his newly formed group called Band of Joy (reprising the name of his first band in the 1960s). The group included singer Patty Griffin, singer-guitarist Buddy Miller, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Darrell Scott, bassist-vocalist Byron House, and drummer-percussionist-vocalist Marco Giovino.

A one-off show in the United States on 12 September 2010 at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City, was followed by an eleven-date autumn 2010 tour in Europe and a North America tour in 2011.

A new studio album called &quot;Band of Joy&quot; was released on 13 September 2010 on the Rounder Records label. The album was nominated for Best Americana Album in the 2011 Grammy Awards, and Plant&#x27;s performance of &quot;Silver Rider&quot; on the album (a cover from the Low album &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot;) was nominated for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.

The band played their final scheduled show together at the Big Chill Festival at Eastnor Castle Deer Park in Herefordshire on 7 August 2011. The show ended with Plant bidding his bandmates &quot;a fond farewell&quot;.

September 2011 – Plant played in Marfa, TX at El Cosmic Trans – Pecos Festival as part of a band called Crown Vic consisting of Patty Griffin, Dony Wynn, David Grissom, Glenn Fukunaga, Michael Ramos.

On 30 September 2011, Plant and Band of Joy played in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park, as part of the 11th Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival.

Released in October 2011, Plant duetted with Alfie Boe on &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; for Alfie&#x27;s sixth album, Alfie, which he also recorded himself on 2002&#x27;s &quot;Dreamland&quot;.

===Sensational Space Shifters (2012–2018)===
It was first reported that Robert Plant&#x27;s new band, the Sensational Space Shifters, would be debuting at 2012&#x27;s WOMAD festival in Wiltshire, England. An intimate warm up gig was then announced in Gloucester on 8 May 2012 to a crowd of 400. Although it was initially reported that there were 10 members of the band, along with Plant the band consists of former Strange Sensation members, Cast guitarist Liam &quot;Skin&quot; Tyson, Justin Adams, Billy Fuller and John Baggott along with Dave Smith and Juldeh Camara. Patty Griffin was the special guest on the first few shows prior to her new album release and subsequent tour.

On 13 July 2012, the band released a download live album called &quot;Sensational Space Shifters (Live in London July &#x27;12)&quot;. This album featured a mix of Strange Sensation and Led Zeppelin reinterpretations as well as covers and a spot by Patty Griffin. In addition to WOMAD and the Gloucester show, the Sensational Space Shifters were scheduled for the free Sunflower River Blues &amp; Gospel Festival&#x27;s 25th anniversary in Clarksdale, Mississippi on 10–12 August 2012.

Released in 2014, &quot;Lullaby and the Ceaseless Roar&quot; is Plant&#x27;s tenth solo album and the first studio recording with his band the Sensational Space Shifters. 
On 28 June 2014, Plant and the Sensational Space Shifters played at the Glastonbury Extravaganza. The band featured West African musician Juldeh Camara, guitarists Skin Tyson and Justin Adams, drummer Dave Smith, Massive Attack keyboardist John Baggott, and bassist Billy Fuller. On 7 August 2014, Plant announced an autumn 2014 7-date North American tour from 25 September (in Port Chester, NY) to 7 October 2014 (in Los Angeles, CA).

To celebrate Record Store Day 2015 (Saturday 18 April), Plant released a special 10-inch live EP titled &quot;More Roar&quot;, which was limited to 10,000 copies. During a concert at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City on 19 September 2015, Plant hinted at plans for a new album with the Sensational Space Shifters, stating, &quot;We&#x27;ll go make another record and then we&#x27;ll come see you guys even more.&quot;

On 25 April 2015, Plant headlined a special event, &quot;Lead Belly at 125&quot; – a tribute to American Folk Legend Lead Belly at Kennedy Centre in conjunction with the Grammy Museum and performed with Alison Krauss, Viktor Krauss, Buddy Miller.

Plant covered Elbow&#x27;s track, &quot;Blanket of Night&quot;, featured on the British Red Cross&#x27; compilation LP &quot;The Long Road&quot;, released on 4 March 2016. The LP aimed to raise awareness of the &quot;struggles faced by refugees and asylum seekers at a time of increased global conflict and migration&quot;. &quot;We have a worldwide international catastrophe,&quot; says Plant. &quot;Talking about it is one thing, doing something about it is another. The position we are in, it&#x27;s paramount we all do our best one way or another to help.&quot; Plant later confirmed that in October he would join artists including Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle, Patty Griffin, for select dates on the Lampedusa Concerts for Refugees tour. The tour across 11 North American cities was a series of acoustic concerts intended to raise awareness of the worldwide refugee crisis and funds to support educational programs for refugees.

Plant&#x27;s eleventh solo album, &quot;Carry Fire,&quot; was released on 13 October 2017 and was the second studio album to be supported by his band the Sensational Space Shifters. In 2018, Plant received the AMA Lifetime Achievement Award at the UK Americana Honors &amp; Awards. Plant headlined the Sunday night of Iceland&#x27;s Secret Solstice Festival in Reykjavík on 23 June 2019.

On 19 July 2021, Plant appeared onstage for his first post-pandemic show in Worthing, England, performing with his band Saving Grace for the first time since 2019. He went on to tour the UK with Saving Grace for their rescheduled shows.

==Led Zeppelin-related projects and reunion rumours==
Plant performed with living members of Led Zeppelin both on 13 July 1985 for Live Aid (with Phil Collins and Tony Thompson on drums) and on 15 May 1988 for Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary. At the 1988 reunion, Jason Bonham, the son of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s late drummer John Bonham, played drums. Both sets featured only a few songs, performed with minimal rehearsal. Plant was unhappy with both performances, saying that &quot;it was like sleeping with your ex-wife but not making love.&quot; At the 1990 Silver Clef Award Winners Concert at Knebworth, Plant was joined by Jimmy Page. Some of their set was released on the subsequent live album and video. In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Plant performed a medley of blues numbers at the induction show with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Jason Bonham, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, then they were joined by fellow inductee Neil Young for &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;.

After years of reunion rumours, Led Zeppelin performed a full two-hour set on 10 December 2007 at the Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert, with Jason again filling in on drums. Despite enormous public demand, Plant declined a $200 million offer to tour with Led Zeppelin after the 2007 show. In interviews following the 2007 show, Plant left the door open to possible future performances with Led Zeppelin, saying that he enjoyed the reunion and felt that the show was strong musically. Although Page and Jones have expressed the strong desire to tour as Led Zeppelin, Plant has consistently opposed a full tour and has responded negatively to questions about another reunion. In a January 2008 interview, he stated that he does not want to &quot;tour like a bunch of bored old men following the Rolling Stones around.&quot; In a statement on his web site in late 2008, Plant stated, &quot;I will not be touring with Led Zeppelin or anyone else for the next two years. Anyone buying Led Zeppelin tickets will be buying bogus tickets.&quot;

In February 2013, Plant hinted that he was open to a Led Zeppelin reunion in 2014, though suggesting that he was not the reason for Led Zeppelin&#x27;s dormancy, saying that Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones &quot;are Capricorns...They&#x27;re quite contained in their own worlds and they leave it to me&quot;, adding that he was &quot;not the bad guy&quot; and that &quot;You need to see the Capricorns – I&#x27;ve got nothing to do in 2014&quot;.

In a spring 2014 interview with the BBC about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s first three albums, Page said he was sure fans would be keen on another reunion show, but Plant later replied that &quot;the chances of it happening [were] zero&quot;. Page then told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was &quot;fed up&quot; with Plant&#x27;s refusal to play, stating: &quot;I was told last year that Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He&#x27;s just playing games, and I&#x27;m fed up with it, to be honest with you. I don&#x27;t sing, so I can&#x27;t do much about it&quot;, adding: &quot;I definitely want to play live. Because, you know, I&#x27;ve still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play. So, yeah, I&#x27;ll just get myself into musical shape, just concentrating on the guitar.&quot;

On 30 July 2014, NME revealed that Plant was &quot;slightly disappointed and baffled&quot; by Page in an ongoing Led Zeppelin dispute during which Page declared he was &quot;fed up&quot; with Plant delaying Led Zeppelin reunion plans. Instead, Plant offered Led Zeppelin&#x27;s guitarist to write acoustically with him as he is interested in working with Page again but only in an unplugged way. Page responded:

==Personal life==
Plant married Maureen Wilson on 9 November 1968. The couple had three children: daughter Carmen Jane (1968) (who later married Charlie Jones, Plant&#x27;s bass player for solo tours); and sons Karac Pendragon (1972–1977), and Logan Romero (1979). In 1977, during Led Zeppelin&#x27;s US tour, their five-year-old son, Karac, died of a stomach illness. The song &quot;All My Love&quot;, co-written with John Paul Jones, is a tribute to him.

The couple divorced in August 1983.

In 1991, Plant and Shirley Wilson (sister of ex-wife Maureen) had a son, Jesse Lee.

From 1993 to 1995, Plant dated British singer Najma Akhtar, who provided vocals on the Page &amp; Plant Unledded tour.

Plant is interested in Welsh history and donated money to the creation of a bronze statue of the Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr, at Pennal Church, near Machynlleth, in Wales, unveiled in September 2004. He is also believed to have contributed funds to a slate carving of Glyndŵr&#x27;s coat of arms at the Celtica museum in Machynlleth. Plant is part of a Glyndŵr network, and attends meetings about him in Wales.

In the New Year Honours List 2009, Plant was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire &quot;for services to music&quot; and on 10 July 2009 invested by then-Prince of Wales King Charles III.

On 14 August 2009, football club Wolverhampton Wanderers announced that Plant has become the club&#x27;s third vice-president. Plant officially received the honour before kick-off at the club&#x27;s first match of the season against West Ham United. Plant was five years old when he first visited Molineux Stadium. He recalled in an interview with his local paper, the &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot;, in August 2010: &quot;I was five when my dad took me down for the first time and Billy Wright waved at me. Honest, he did. And that was it – I was hooked from that moment.&quot;

In late 2010, BBC Two aired a documentary titled &quot;Robert Plant: By Myself&quot;. It features Robert Plant discussing his journey with Led Zeppelin and various projects since.

In a July 2012 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, Plant stated he &quot;eloped and ran off to Texas&quot; with American singer Patty Griffin. Plant&#x27;s UK-based manager later told &quot;E! News&quot; that Plant was apparently being cheeky when he used the word &quot;eloped&quot; to describe his home life, for &quot;Robert has not married Patty Griffin,&quot; instead &quot;He was just referring to the fact that he&#x27;s been residing in Texas&quot; with her. According to a July 2012 &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; article, Plant and Griffin had been dating for over a year, spending half of their time together in Austin, Texas. On 23 August 2014, &quot;The Independent&quot; indicated Plant had broken up with Griffin: &quot;Patty and I tried a sort of zig-zag across the Atlantic,&quot; Plant told the publication, &quot;but she didn&#x27;t share my penchant for cider and she used to marvel at the Black Country character I became after four pints of Thatchers. My feelings are very much ones of sadness and regret.&quot;

In early 2013, Plant contributed to a community buyout scheme to save the Bath music venue The Bell Inn.

He currently resides at Shatterford, near Bewdley in the Wyre Forest District of Worcestershire.

In 2020, Plant donated money towards frontline medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The money went to the GoFundMe page of a small clothing manufacturer in Kidderminster, England that makes scrubs for local hospitals.

==Legacy==
Plant has influenced the style of many of his contemporaries, including Geddy Lee, Ann Wilson, Sammy Hagar, and later rock vocalists such as Jeff Buckley and Jack White who imitated his performing style. Freddie Mercury of Queen, and Axl Rose of Guns N&#x27; Roses were influenced by Plant. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; notes that &quot;Exaggerating the vocal style and expressive palette of blues singers such as Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Muddy Waters, Plant created the sound that has defined much hard rock and heavy metal singing: a high range, an abundance of distortion, loud volume, and emotional excess&quot;. Plant received the Knebworth Silver Clef Award in 1990.

In 2006, hard rock/heavy metal magazine &quot;Hit Parader&quot; named Plant as No. 1 on its list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time, a list that included Rob Halford of Judas Priest (No. 2), Steven Tyler (No. 3), Freddie Mercury (No. 6), Geddy Lee (No. 13) and Paul Stanley (No. 18), all of whom were influenced by Plant. In 2008, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Plant the 15th-greatest singer of all time on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;. In 2009, he was voted the &quot;greatest voice in rock&quot; in a poll conducted by &quot;Planet Rock&quot;. He was included in the &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2009 list of &quot;Artists of the Century&quot; and was ranked at number 8 in their list of &quot;100 Greatest Singers&quot; in 2007. In 2009, Plant also won the Outstanding Contribution to Music prize at the Q Awards. He was placed at No. 3 on &quot;SPIN&quot;″s list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Rock Frontmen of All Time&quot;.

On 20 September 2010 National Public Radio (NPR) named Plant as one of the &quot;50 Great Voices&quot; in the world.

In July 2018, Plant won the Silver Cleff Integro Outstanding Award, announced by music charity Nordoff Robbins.

On 15 March 2022 Plant was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His musical choices included &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Superstitious&quot; by Howlin&#x27; Wolf and &quot;Ohio&quot; by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. His book choice was &quot;The Earliest English Poems&quot;, translated by Michael Alexander, his luxury item was a basket containing photos of homing pigeons and his favourite musical piece was &quot;Serenade&quot; by Mario Lanza.

<text>Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural or cultural values. Protected areas are those areas in which human presence or the exploitation of natural resources (e.g. firewood, non-timber forest products, water, ...) is limited.

The term &quot;protected area&quot; also includes marine protected areas and transboundary protected areas across multiple borders. As of 2016, there are over 161,000 protected areas representing about 17 percent of the world&#x27;s land surface area (excluding Antarctica).

For waters under national jurisdiction beyond inland waters, there are 14,688 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), covering approximately 10.2% of coastal and marine areas and 4.12% of global ocean areas. In contrast, only 0.25% of the world&#x27;s oceans beyond national jurisdiction are covered by MPAs.

In recent years, the 30 by 30 initiative has targeted to protect 30% of ocean territory and 30% of land territory worldwide by 2030; this has been adopted by the European Union in its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, Campaign for Nature which promoted the goal during the Convention on Biodiversity&#x27;s COP15 Summit and the G7. In December 2022, Nations have reached an agreement with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework at the COP15, which includes the 30 by 30 initiative.

Protected areas are implemented for biodiversity conservation, often providing habitat and protection from hunting for threatened and endangered species. Protection helps maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Indigenous peoples and local communities frequently criticize this method of fortress conservation for the generally violent processes by which the regulations of the areas are enforced.

==Definition==
The definition that has been widely accepted across regional and global frameworks has been provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its categorisation guidelines for protected areas. The definition is as follows:

A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.

=== Protected Areas and Climate Change ===
Protected Areas alleviate climate change effects in a variety of ways:

* Prohibition of degradative activities including: fishing, hunting, development, agriculture, mining, logging, and sometimes entry.
* Reduction in: shifts in species distribution, intensity of storms, and impacts of sea level rise.
* Combats ocean acidification by: maintaining coastal primary producers, increasing teleost biomass (osmosregulation buffers pH change), and increasing natural carbon sequestration via the biological pump
* Increased: populations, species resilience, genetic diversity, and potential for adaptations, lowering the risk of extinction

==Protection of natural resources==
The objective of protected areas is to conserve biodiversity and to provide a way for measuring the progress of such conservation. Protected areas will usually encompass several other zones that have been deemed important for particular conservation uses, such as Important Bird Areas (IBA) and Endemic Bird Areas (EBA), Centres of Plant Diversity (CPD), Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCA), Alliance for Zero Extinction Sites (AZE) and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) among others. Likewise, a protected area or an entire network of protected areas may lie within a larger geographic zone that is recognised as a terrestrial or marine ecoregions (see Global 200), or a Crisis Ecoregions for example. As a result, Protected Areas can encompass a broad range of governance types. A wide variety of rights-holders and stakeholders are involved in the governance and management of protected areas, including forest protected areas, such as government agencies and ministries at various levels, elected and traditional authorities, indigenous peoples and local communities, private individuals and non-profit trusts, among others. Most protected-area and forest management institutions acknowledge the importance of recognizing the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, sharing the costs and benefits of protected areas and actively involving them in their governance and management. This has led to the recognition of four main types of governance, defined on the basis of who holds authority, responsibility, and who can be held accountable for the key decisions for protected areas. Indeed, governance of protected areas has emerged a critical factor in their success.

Subsequently, the range of natural resources that any one protected area may guard is vast. Many will be allocated primarily for species conservation whether it be flora or fauna or the relationship between them, but protected areas are similarly important for conserving sites of (indigenous) cultural importance and considerable reserves of natural resources such as;

* Carbon stocks: Carbon emissions from deforestation account for an estimated 20% of global carbon emissions, so in protecting the worlds carbon stocks greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and longterm land cover change is prevented, which is an effective strategy in the struggle against global warming. Of all global terrestrial carbon stock, 15.2% is contained within protected areas. Protected areas in South America hold 27% of the world&#x27;s carbon stock, which is the highest percentage of any continent in both absolute terms and as a proportion of the total stock.
* Rainforests: 18.8% of the world&#x27;s forest is covered by protected areas and sixteen of the twenty forest types have 10% or more protected area coverage. Of the 670 ecoregions with forest cover, 54% have 10% or more of their forest cover protected under IUCN Categories I – VI.
* Mountains: Nationally designated protected areas cover 14.3% of the world&#x27;s mountain areas, and these mountainous protected areas made up 32.5% of the world&#x27;s total terrestrial protected area coverage in 2009. Mountain protected area coverage has increased globally by 21% since 1990 and out of the 198 countries with mountain areas, 43.9% still have less than 10% of their mountain areas protected.

Annual updates on each of these analyses are made in order to make comparisons to the Millennium Development Goals and several other fields of analysis are expected to be introduced in the monitoring of protected areas management effectiveness, such as freshwater and marine or coastal studies which are currently underway, and islands and drylands which are currently in planning.

== Protection of biodiversity ==
The effectiveness of protected areas to protect biodiversity can be estimated by comparing population changes over time. Such an analysis found that the abundance of 2,239 terrestrial vertebrate populations changed at slower rate in protected areas. On average, vertebrate populations declined five times more slowly within protected areas (−0.4% per year) than at similar sites lacking protection (−1.8% per year).

== Protection of ecosystem services ==
Along with providing important stocks of natural resources, protected areas are often major sources of vital ecosystem services, unbeknownst to human society. Although biodiversity is usually the main reason for constructing protected areas, the protection of biodiversity also protects the ecosystem services society enjoys. Some ecosystem services include those that provide and regulate resources, support natural processes, or represent culture. Provisioning services provide resources to humanity, such as fuel and water, while regulating services include carbon sequestration, climate regulation, and protection against disease. Supporting ecosystem services include nutrient cycling, while cultural services are a source of aesthetic and cultural value for tourism and heritage. Such services are often overlooked by humanity, due to the ecosystem from which they originate being far from urbanized areas. The contamination of ecosystem services within a designated area ultimately degrades their use for society. For example, the protection of a water body inherently protects that water body&#x27;s microorganisms and their ability to adequately filter pollutants and pathogens, ultimately protecting water quality itself. Therefore, the implementation of protected areas is vital to maintaining the quality and consistency of ecosystem services, ultimately allowing human society to function without the interference of human infrastructure or policies.

==IUCN Protected Area Management Categories==

Through its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), the IUCN has developed six Protected Area Management Categories that define protected areas according to their management objectives, which are internationally recognised by various national governments and the United Nations. The categories provide international standards for defining protected areas and encourage conservation planning according to their management aims.

IUCN Protected Area Management Categories:
* Category Ia – Strict nature reserve
* Category Ib – Wilderness Area
* Category II – National park
* Category III – Natural monument or Feature
* Category IV – Habitat/Species Management Area
* Category V – Protected Landscape/Seascape
* Category VI – Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources

==History==
Protected areas are cultural artifacts, and their story is entwined with that of human civilization. Protecting places and natural resources is by no means a modern concept, whether it be indigenous communities guarding sacred sites or the convention of European hunting reserves. Over 2000 years ago, royal decrees in India protected certain areas. In Europe, rich and powerful people protected hunting grounds for a thousand years. Moreover, the idea of protection of special places is universal: for example, it occurs among the communities in the Pacific (&quot;tapu&quot; areas) and in parts of Africa (sacred groves).

The oldest legally protected reserve recorded in history is the Main Ridge Forest Reserve, established by an ordinance dated 13 April 1776. Other sources mention the 1778 approval of a protected area on then-Khan Uul, a mountain previous protected by local nomads for centuries in Mongolia, by then-ruling Qing China Tenger Tetgegch Khaan. However, the mass protected areas movement did not begin until late nineteenth-century in North America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, when other countries were quick to follow suit. While the idea of protected areas spread around the world in the twentieth century, the driving force was different in different regions. Thus, in North America, protected areas were about safeguarding dramatic and sublime scenery; in Africa, the concern was with game parks; in Europe, landscape protection was more common.

The designation of protected areas often also contained a political statement. In the 17th and 18th centuries, protected areas were mostly hunting grounds of rulers and thus, on the one hand, an expression of the absolute personal authority of a monarch, and on the other hand, they were concentrated in certain places and diminished with increasing spatial distance from the seat of power. In the late 19th century, modern territorial states emerged which, thanks to the transport and communication technologies of industrialisation and the closely meshed and well-connected administrative apparatus that came with it, could actually assert claims to power over large contiguous territories. The establishment of nature reserves in mostly peripheral regions thus became possible and at the same time underpinned the new state claim to power.

Initially, protected areas were recognised on a national scale, differing from country to country until 1933, when an effort to reach an international consensus on the standards and terminology of protected areas took place at the International Conference for the Protection of Fauna and Flora in London. At the 1962 First World Conference on National Parks in Seattle the effect the Industrial Revolution had had on the world&#x27;s natural environment was acknowledged, and the need to preserve it for future generations was established.

Since then, it has been an international commitment on behalf of both governments and non-government organisations to maintain the networks that hold regular revisions for the succinct categorisations that have been developed to regulate and record protected areas. In 1972, the Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment endorsed the protection of representative examples of all major ecosystem types as a fundamental requirement of national conservation programmes. This has become a core principle of conservation biology and has remained so in recent resolutions – including the World Charter for Nature in 1982, the Rio Declaration at the Earth Summit in 1992, and the Johannesburg Declaration 2002.

Recently, the importance of protected areas has been brought to the fore at the threat of human-induced global heating and the understanding of the necessity to consume natural resources in a sustainable manner. The spectrum of benefits and values of protected areas is recognised not only ecologically, but culturally through further development in the arena of Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs). ICCAs are &quot;natural and/or modified ecosystems containing significant bio - diversity values and ecological services, voluntarily conserved by (sedentary and mobile) indigenous and local communities, through customary laws or other effective means&quot;.

As of December 2022, 17% of land territory and 10% of ocean territory were protected. At the 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference almost 200 countries, signed onto the agreement which includes protecting 30% of land and oceans by 2030 (30 by 30).

==Convention on Biological Diversity==
In 1992, a protected area was defined in paragraph 2 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as &quot;a geographically defined area which is designated or regulated and managed to achieve specific conservation objectives.&quot; Under Article 8 of the CBD, parties who entered the treaty agreed to, among other things, &quot;establish a system of protected areas.&quot; 
In 2004, the CBD&#x27;s Conference of the Parties (COP) adopted the Program of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA) to further develop and promote protected areas. PoWPA&#x27;s objective was the &quot;establishment and maintenance by 2010 for terrestrial and by 2012 for marine areas of comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas that collectively, inter alia through a global network contribute to achieving the three objectives of the Convention and the 2010 target to significantly reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss.&quot;
In 2010, protected areas were included in Target 11 of the CBD&#x27;s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, known as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Target 11 states:
:&quot;By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes.&quot;

In 2018, to complement protected areas across landscapes and seascapes, the term &#x27;other effective area-based conservation measures&#x27; was defined as &quot;a geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socio-economic, and other locally relevant values.&quot; Other effective area-based conservation measures complement protected areas across landscapes, seascapes, and river basins. Protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures are referenced together in Target 3 of the draft Global Biodiversity Framework, which is due to be agreed at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which will be held 5 to 17 December in Montreal, Canada.

==Challenges==

How to manage areas protected for conservation brings up a range of challenges – whether it be regarding the local population, specific ecosystems or the design of the reserve itself – and because of the many unpredicatable elements in ecology issues, each protected area requires a case-specific set of guidelines.

Enforcing protected area boundaries is a costly and labour-heavy endeavour, particularly if the allocation of a new protected region places new restrictions on the use of resources by the native people which may lead to their subsequent displacement. This has troubled relationships between conservationists and rural communities in many protected regions and is often why many Wildlife Reserves and National Parks face the human threat of poaching for the illegal bushmeat or trophy trades, which are resorted to as an alternative form of substinence. Poaching has thus increased in recent years as areas with certain species are no longer easily and legally accessible. This increasing threat has often led governments to enforce laws and implement new policies to adhere to the initial goal of protected areas, though many illegal activities are often overlooked.

There is increasing pressure to take proper account of human needs when setting up protected areas and these sometimes have to be &quot;traded off&quot; against conservation needs. Whereas in the past governments often made decisions about protected areas and informed local people afterwards, today the emphasis is shifting towards greater discussions with stakeholders and joint decisions about how such lands should be set aside and managed. Such negotiations are never easy but usually produce stronger and longer-lasting results for both conservation and people.

In some countries, protected areas can be assigned without the infrastructure and networking needed to substitute consumable resources and substantively protect the area from development or misuse. The soliciting of protected areas may require regulation to the level of meeting demands for food, feed, livestock and fuel, and the legal enforcement of not only the protected area itself but also &#x27;buffer zones&#x27; surrounding it, which may help to resist destabilisation.

Protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD)

Protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) events are processes that change the legal status of national parks and other protected areas in both terrestrial and marine environments. Downgrading is a decrease in legal restrictions on human activities within a protected area, downsizing is a decrease in protected area size through a legal boundary change, and degazettement is the loss of legal protection for an entire protected area. Collectively, PADDD represents legal processes that temper regulations, shrink boundaries, or eliminate legal protections originally associated with establishment of a protected area.

Scientific publications have identified 3,749 enacted PADDD events in 73 countries since 1892 which have collectively impacted an area approximately the size of Mexico. PADDD is a historical and contemporary phenomenon. 78% of PADDD events worldwide were enacted since 2000 and governments in at least 14 countries are currently considering at least 46 PADDD proposals. Proximate causes of PADDD vary widely but most PADDD events globally (62%) are related to industrial scale resource extraction and development – infrastructure, industrial agriculture, mining, oil and gas, forestry, fisheries, and industrialization.

PADDD challenges the longstanding assumption that protected areas are permanent fixtures and highlights the need for decision-makers to consider protected area characteristics and the socioeconomic context in which they are situated to better ensure their permanence.

==Effectiveness==

A main goal of protected areas is to prevent loss of biodiversity. However, their effectiveness is limited by their small size and isolation from each other (which influence the maintenance of species), their restricted role in preventing climate change, invasive species, and pollution, their high costs, and their increasing conflict with human demands for nature&#x27;s resources. In addition, the type of habitat, species composition, legal issues and governance, play important roles.

One major problem is that only 18% of the area covered by protected areas have been assessed, hence the effectiveness of most of them remains unclear.

== Bhutan as a role model ==
Scientists advocate that 50% of global land and seas be converted to inter-connected protected areas to sustain these benefits. The Asian country Bhutan achieved this high-reaching target by reserving 51.4% of the country&#x27;s area as protected areas interconnected through biological corridors. Although these networks are well regulated (local communities are aware of their importance and actively contribute to their maintenance), Bhutan is currently a developing country that is undergoing infrastructure development and resource collection. The country&#x27;s economic progression has brought about human-wildlife conflict and increased pressure on the existence of its protected areas. In light of ongoing disputes on the topic of optimal land usage, Dorji (et al.), in a study using camera traps to detect wildlife activity, summarize the results of a nationwide survey that compares the biodiversity of Bhutan&#x27;s protected areas versus that of intervening non-protected areas.

The study indicated that Bhutan&#x27;s protected areas &quot;are effectively conserving medium and large mammal species, as demonstrated through the significant difference in mammal diversity between protected areas, biological corridors, and non-protected areas with the strongest difference between protected areas and non-protected areas&quot;. Protected areas had the highest levels of mammal biodiversity. This is made possible by the restriction of commercial activity and regulation of consumptive uses (firewood, timber, etc.). The regulation of such practices has allowed Bhutan&#x27;s protected areas to thrive with high carnivore diversity and other rare mammals such as Chinese pangolin, Indian pangolin, mountain weasel (&quot;Mustela altaica)&quot;, small-toothed ferret badger, Asian small clawed otter, the tiger, dhole &quot;(Cuon alpinus&quot;), Binturong, clouded leopard and Tibetan fox (&quot;Vulpes ferrilata)&quot;. Also found to be prevalent were the large herbivore species: Asiatic water buffalo Bubalus arnee, golden langur, musk deer, and Asian elephant. The maintenance of these charismatic megafauna and other threatened species can be attributed to the intensity of Bhutan&#x27;s management of its protected areas and its local communities&#x27; commitment to preserving them.

== By region ==

===Australia===

The National Heritage List is a heritage register, a list of national heritage places deemed to be of outstanding heritage significance to Australia, established in 2003. The list includes natural and historic places, including those of cultural significance to Indigenous Australians. Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) are formed by agreement with Indigenous Australians, and declared by Indigenous Australians, and form a specific class of protected area.

=== China ===
China, a megadiverse country, has begun implementing various protected areas in recent years. As of the year 2017, China has nearly 10,000 to 12,000 protected areas, 80% of which are nature reserves aiming to foster biodiversity conservation. These newly implemented reserves safeguard a range of ecosystems, from tropical forests to marine habitats. These protected areas encompass nearly 20% of China&#x27;s land area.

=== European Union ===
Natura 2000 is a network of protected areas established by the EU across all member states. It is made up of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) designated respectively under the Habitats Directive and Birds Directive. are designated as terrestrial sites and as marine sites. Overall, 18 percent of the EU land mass is designated.

=== India ===
Protected areas of India include National parks, Wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, reserved and protected forests, conservation and community reserves, communal forests, private protected areas and conservation areas.

===Lebanon===
Lebanon, home to one of the highest densities of floral diversity in the Mediterranean basin, hosts tree species with critical biogeographical locations (southernmost limit) on the western slopes of Mount Lebanon’s mountain range and has passed laws to protect environmental sites at the national level, including nature reserves, forests, and Hima (local community-based conservation), with some of these sites having acquired one or more international designations:
* Four Ramsar sites
* Five UNESCO World Heritage Sites
* 15 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) (under Birdlife International)
* One Specially Protected Area (SPA) 
* Two Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI) (under the Protocol of Specially Protected Areas and Biodiversity of the Barcelona Convention)

There are three biosphere reserves in Lebanon that have been designated by the UNESCO:
# Al Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve, designated in 2005
# Jabal Al Rihane Biosphere Reserve, designated in 2007
# Jabal Moussa Biosphere Reserve, designated in 2009

=== Nicaragua ===
O Parks, Wildlife, and Recreation is a private protected area, also known as a &#x27;Private Reserve&#x27; predominantly managed for biodiversity conservation, protected without formal government recognition and is owned and stewarded by the O corporation International. O parks plays a particularly important role in conserving critical biodiversity in a section of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor known as the Paso del Istmo, located along the 12-mile-wide isthmus between Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific Ocean.

=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines, protected areas are administered by the Biodiversity Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act of 1992.

As of 2020, there are 244 protected areas in the Philippines, covering a total area of about – 15.4% of the Philippines&#x27; total area.

=== Russia ===
On 21 May 2019, The &quot;Moscow Times&quot; cited a World Wildlife Fund report indicating that Russia now ranks first in the world for its amount of protected natural areas with 63.3 million hectares of specially protected natural areas. However, the article did not contain a link to WWF&#x27;s report and it may be based on previously gathered data.

=== United States ===
, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, the United States had a total of 6770 terrestrial nationally designated (federal) protected areas. These protected areas cover , or 27.08 percent of the land area of the United States. This is also one-tenth of the protected land area of the world. 

According to a report from the Center for American Progress, the administration of Joe Biden reached a record in conservation. In 3 years of ruling it conserved or in the process of conserving more than 24 millions acres of public land and in 2023 alone more than 12.5 million acres of public land became protected area. It is doing it together with the indigenous people as 200 agreements of co-stewardship with them were signed in 2023 alone. The goal of Biden is to protect 30% of the terrestrial and marine territory of the United States by the year 2030.

<text>Protected areas of the United Kingdom are areas in the United Kingdom which need and /or receive protection because of their environmental, historical or cultural value to the nation. Methods and aims of protection vary depending on the nature and importance of the resource. Protection operates at local, regional, national and international levels, and may be backed by legislation and international treaty, or less formally by planning policy. 

Within the United Kingdom, different approaches are taken to some forms of protection within the constituent countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, while other forms of protection are more consistent across the UK. Protected areas can be divided according to the type of resource which each seeks to protect. Primarily, these are: scenic or landscape value; biodiversity value (species and habitats); geodiversity value (relating to geology and geomorphology); and cultural or historic value. Several types of protected areas are focused on more than one of these areas. 

Besides protected areas, a number of individual features are protected through other designations, such as tree preservation orders, listed buildings, and protected shipwrecks.

==Areas protected for scenic value==

<doc id="100410" wikidata="Q503021" url="?curid=100410" title="Natura 2000">
<text>Natura 2000 is a network of nature protection areas in the territory of the European Union. It is made up of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas designated under the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive, respectively. The network includes both terrestrial and Marine Protected Areas.

The Natura 2000 network covered more than 18% of the European Union&#x27;s land area and more than 7% of its marine area in 2022.

==History==
In May 1992, the governments of the European Communities adopted legislation designed to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across Europe. The Habitats Directive complements the Birds Directive adopted in 1979, and together they make up the Natura 2000 network of protected areas.

The Birds Directive requires the establishment of Special Protection Areas for birds. The Habitats Directive similarly requires Sites of Community Importance which upon the agreement of the European Commission become Special Areas of Conservation to be designated for species other than birds, and for habitat types (e.g. particular types of forest, grasslands, wetlands, etc.). Together, Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation form the Natura 2000 network of protected areas.

The Natura 2000 network is the EU contribution to the &quot;Emerald network&quot; of Areas of Special Conservation Interest set up under the Bern Convention on the conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats. Natura 2000 is also a key contribution to the Program of Work of Protected Areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

As a prerequisite for joining the EU, accession states have to submit proposals for Natura 2000 sites meeting the same criteria as EU member states. Some new member states have large areas which qualify to be protected under the directives, and implementation has not always been simple.

The Natura 2000 sites are selected by member states and the European Commission following strictly scientific criteria according to the two directives mentioned above. The Special Protection Areas are designated directly by each EU member state, while the Special Areas of Conservation follow a more elaborate process: each EU member state must compile a list of the best wildlife areas containing the habitats and species listed in the Habitats Directive; this list must then be submitted to the European Commission, after which an evaluation and selection process on European level will take place in order to become a Natura 2000 site.

The Habitats Directive divides the EU territory into nine biogeographic regions, each with its own ecological coherence. Natura 2000 sites are selected according to the conditions in each biogeographical region; thus selected sites represent species and habitat types under similar natural conditions across a suite of countries.

Each Natura 2000 site has a unique identification form called a standard data form. This form is used as a legal reference when assessing the management of the species and habitats through the concept of favourable conservation status. The Natura 2000 Viewer is a tool to explore the network and gives access to every standard data form.

==Current status==
, Natura 2000 protected 27,312 sites with a terrestrial area of (around 18 percent of land of the EU countries) and marine area of , and was considered almost complete in the EU terrestrial environment. The process of designation has not always been smooth as the infringement procedures against member states show. While designation of sites may be near complete, the management and enforcement of protection on sites is less advanced and many sites lack management plans. Natura 2000 faced criticism from developers, farmers and politicians who fear that the conservation of habitats and species places a brake on development.

In 2013, there were designated as Natura 2000 in the marine environment. The network in marine areas is not considered complete and acknowledged by the Commission as a &quot;key challenge for EU biodiversity policy in the coming years&quot;.

Natura 2000 sites can vary considerably in character. They are not strictly protected in terms of how they are allowed to be used by people. Many sites are farmed, forested and some are even in urban areas. Other areas are much wilder. The European Commission developed guidelines on the relation between Natura 2000 and wild areas which are thought to make up around 13% of the network. This was in response to a report by Members of the European Parliament in 2009 which called for further protection of Europe&#x27;s wilderness.

==Raising awareness==
The Natura 2000 network is not well known among European Union citizens; only 11% of citizens knew what it was in 2013. As part of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, the European Commission committed to raise awareness about the network and biodiversity in general with the public.

===Natura 2000 Day===
In order to raise awareness about the Natura 2000 network, 21 May has been designated “Natura 2000 Day”. This precedes “International Day for Biological Diversity” on 22 May. The initiative came from SEO/BirdLife who sought and received funding from the EU LIFE+ programme in order to improve the knowledge of this network.

In 2013, the first Natura 2000 day took place with the aim to raise awareness of citizens about the importance of Natura 2000 network in their lives. Since then, every May 21 and the weeks before, awareness actions take place all over Europe. For example, in 2014, school children and politicians across the EU were encouraged to make a butterfly gesture and post photos on social media to raise awareness.

===The Natura 2000 Award===
The Natura 2000 Award was launched by the European Commission in 2013, with the first prizes awarded on Natura 2000 Day in 2014. The annual Award aims to raise awareness about the Natura 2000 network, showcase excellence and encourage networking between people working on Natura 2000 sites.

It awards prizes to those working on the management of or to raise awareness about Natura 2000 in five award categories: Conservation; Socio-Economic Benefits; Communication; Reconciling Interests and Perceptions; Cross-Border Cooperation and Networking. In its first year, winners were selected from Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Belgium and Spain.

== Controversy ==
The Natura 2000 legislation, notably with its habitats-test (or: habitats assessment, Article 6 of the Habitats Directive), dates back to the days climate change was not an issue and the concept of ecosystem services had not been well developed. Hence, in international law literature Kistenkas raised the question the habitats assessment was originally not designed for striking a balance of all relevant ecosystem services or to involve climate change into the assessment. Although well protecting nature conservation objectives, a rethinking of the habitats assessment might be necessary in the light of a new climate law as part of e.g. the European Green Deal.

In European law literature Borgstrom and Kistenkas have discussed some possible future incompatibilities of the Natura 2000 habitats-test with novel EU green infrastructure policies.

In the late 2010s the habitats assessment was at the basis of the nitrogen crisis in the Netherlands as the EU Court (C-293/17 and C-294/17, ECLI:EU:C:2018:882) ruled on agriculture nearby Natura 2000 sites.

In some other member states, such as Bulgaria, there was criticism a project had not been well communicated in advance. This led to construction in the Kaliakra zone of Bulgaria, including wind turbines and a golf course. Land owners have then been told they may not use their land in certain ways, otherwise non-compliance procedures would be used against Bulgaria. This led to protests by the land-owners.

<doc id="100413" wikidata="Q332412" url="?curid=100413" title="Tony Benn">
<text>Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn (3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014), known between 1960 and 1963 as Viscount Stansgate, was a British Labour Party politician and political activist who served as a Cabinet minister in the 1960s and 1970s. He was the Member of Parliament for Bristol South East and Chesterfield for 47 of the 51 years between 1950 and 2001. He later served as President of the Stop the War Coalition from 2001 to 2014.

The son of a Liberal and later Labour Party politician, Benn was born in Westminster and privately educated at Westminster School. He was elected for Bristol South East at the 1950 general election but inherited his father&#x27;s peerage on his death, which prevented him from continuing to serve as an MP. He fought to remain in the House of Commons and campaigned for the ability to renounce the title, a campaign which eventually succeeded with the Peerage Act 1963. He was an active member of the Fabian Society and served as chairman from 1964 to 1965. He served in Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government, first as Postmaster General, where he oversaw the opening of the Post Office Tower, and later as Minister of Technology.

Benn served as Chairman of the National Executive Committee from 1971 to 1972 while in Opposition. In the Labour government of 1974–1979, he returned to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Industry and subsequently served as Secretary of State for Energy. He retained that post when James Callaghan succeeded Wilson as Prime Minister. When the Labour Party was in opposition through the 1980s, he emerged as a prominent figure on the left wing of the party and unsuccessfully challenged Neil Kinnock for the Labour leadership in 1988. After leaving Parliament at the 2001 general election, Benn was President of the Stop the War Coalition until his death in 2014.

Benn was widely seen as a key proponent of democratic socialism and Christian socialism, though in regards to the latter he supported the United Kingdom becoming a secular state and ending the Church of England&#x27;s status as an official church of the United Kingdom. Originally considered a moderate within the party, he was identified as belonging to its left wing after leaving ministerial office. The terms Bennism and Bennite came into usage to describe the left-wing politics he espoused from the late 1970s and its adherents. He was an influence on the political views of Jeremy Corbyn, who was elected Leader of the Labour Party a year after Benn&#x27;s death, and John McDonnell, who served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer under Corbyn.

==Early life and family==
Benn was born in Westminster, London, on 3 April 1925. He had two brothers, Michael (1921–1944), who was killed in the Second World War, and David (1928–2017), a specialist in Russia and Eastern Europe. Following the Thames flood in January 1928 their house was uninhabitable so the Benn family moved to Scotland for over 12 months. Their father, William Benn, was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1906 who crossed the floor to the Labour Party in 1928 and was appointed Secretary of State for India by Ramsay MacDonald in 1929, a position he held until the Labour Party&#x27;s landslide electoral defeat in 1931.

William Benn was elevated to the House of Lords and Tony Benn was subsequently titled with the honorific prefix, &quot;The Honourable.&quot; William Benn was given the title of Viscount Stansgate in 1942: the new wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house. In 1945–46, William Benn was the Secretary of State for Air in the first majority Labour Government.

Benn&#x27;s mother, Margaret Benn (&quot;née&quot; Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, feminist and the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She was a member of the League of the Church Militant, which was the predecessor of the Movement for the Ordination of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the ordination of women. His mother&#x27;s theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were mostly about the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.

Benn was for over 30 years a committed Christian. He said that the teachings of Jesus Christ had a &quot;radical political importance&quot; on his life, and made a distinction between the historical Jesus as &quot;a carpenter of Nazareth&quot; who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and &quot;the way in which he&#x27;s presented by some religious authorities; by popes, archbishops and bishops who present Jesus as justification for their power&quot;, believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of the role of Jesus. He believed that it was a &quot;great mistake&quot; to assume that the teachings of Christianity are outdated in modern Britain, and Higgins wrote in &quot;The Benn Inheritance&quot; that Benn was &quot;a socialist whose political commitment owes much more to the teaching of Jesus than the writing of Marx&quot;. (Indeed, he did not read &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; until he was in his 50s.) &quot;The driving force of his life was Christian socialism,&quot; according to Peter Wilby, linking Benn to the &quot;high-minded&quot; founding roots of Labour.

Later in his life, Benn emphasised issues regarding morality and righteousness, as well as various ethical principles of Nonconformism. On &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; he said that he had been powerfully influenced by &quot;what I would call the Dissenting tradition&quot; (that is, the English Dissenters who left or were ejected from the established church, one of whom was his ancestor William Benn). &quot;I&#x27;ve never thought we can understand the world we lived in unless we understood the history of the church&quot;, Benn said to the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;. &quot;All political freedoms were won, first of all, through religious freedom. Some of the arguments about the control of the media today, which are very big arguments, are the arguments that would have been fought in the religious wars. You have the satellites coming in now—well, it is the multinational church all over again. That&#x27;s why Mrs Thatcher pulled Britain out of UNESCO: she was not prepared, any more than Ronald Reagan was, to be part of an organisation that talked about a New World Information Order, people speaking to each other without the help of Murdoch or Maxwell.&quot;

According to Wilby in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Benn &quot;decided to do without the paraphernalia and doctrine of organised religion but not without the teachings of Jesus&quot;. Although Benn became more agnostic as he became older, he was intrigued by the interconnections between Christianity, radicalism and socialism. Wilby also wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that although former Chancellor Stafford Cripps described Benn as &quot;as keen a Christian as I am myself&quot;, Benn wrote in 2005 that he was &quot;a Christian agnostic&quot; who believed &quot;in Jesus the prophet, not Christ the king&quot;, specifically rejecting the label of &quot;humanist&quot;.

Both of Benn&#x27;s grandfathers were Liberal Party MPs; his paternal grandfather was John Benn, a successful politician, MP for Tower Hamlets and later Devonport, who was created a baronet in 1914 (and who founded a publishing company, Benn Brothers), and his maternal grandfather was Daniel Holmes, MP for Glasgow Govan. Benn&#x27;s contact with leading politicians of the day dates back to his earliest years. He met Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald when he was five years old, and described him as: &quot;A kindly old gentleman [who] leaned over me and offered me a chocolate biscuit. I&#x27;ve looked at Labour leaders in a funny way ever since.&quot; Benn also met former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he was 12, and later recalled that, while still a boy, he once shook hands with Mahatma Gandhi, in 1931, while his father was Secretary of State for India.

During the Second World War, Benn joined and trained with the Home Guard from the age of 16, later recalling in a speech made in 2009: &quot;I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I&#x27;d seen a German officer having a meal I&#x27;d have tossed a grenade through the window. Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist?&quot; In July 1943, Benn enlisted in the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman 2nd Class. His father and elder brother Michael (who was later killed in an accident) were already serving in the RAF. He was granted an emergency commission as a pilot officer (on probation) on 10 March 1945. As a pilot officer, Benn served as a pilot in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. In June 1944, he made his first solo flight, at RAF Guinea Fowl, an RAF Elementary Flying Training School, in Southern Rhodesia. The aircraft was a Canadian-built Fairchild Cornell. In a 1993 article recounting the experience, he said, &quot;I always thought that I would feel a sense of panic when I saw the ground coming up at me on my first solo, but strangely enough I didn&#x27;t feel anything but exhilaration ...&quot;. He relinquished his commission with effect from 10 August 1945, three months after the Second World War ended in Europe on 8 May, and just days before the war with Japan ended on 2 September.

After attending Eaton House day school near Sloane Square, Benn entered Westminster School, and studied at New College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, politics and economics and was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1947. In later life, Benn removed public references to his private education from &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;. In 1970 all references to Westminster School were removed, and in the 1975 edition his entry stated: &quot;Education—still in progress&quot;. In the 1976 edition, almost all details were omitted except his name, jobs as a Member of Parliament and as a Government Minister, and address; the publishers confirmed that Benn had sent back the draft entry with everything else struck through. In the 1977 edition, Benn&#x27;s entry disappeared entirely, and when he returned to &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; in 1983, he was listed as &quot;Tony Benn&quot; and all references to his education or service record were removed.

In 1972, Benn said in his diaries that &quot;Today I had the idea that I would resign my Privy Councillorship, my MA and all my honorary doctorates in order to strip myself of what the world had to offer&quot;. While he acknowledged that he &quot;might be ridiculed&quot; for doing so, Benn said that Wedgie Benn&#x27; and &#x27;the Rt Honourable Anthony Wedgwood Benn&#x27; and all that stuff is impossible. I have been Tony Benn in Bristol for a long time.&quot; In October 1973, he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn, and his book &quot;Speeches&quot; from 1974 is credited to &quot;Tony Benn&quot;. Despite this name change, social historian Alwyn W. Turner writes: &quot;Just as those with an agenda to pursue still call Muhammed Ali by his original name ... so most newspapers continued to refer to Tony Benn as Wedgwood Benn, or Wedgie in the case of the tabloids, for years to come.&quot;

Benn met Caroline Middleton DeCamp (born 13 October 1926, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States) over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949; just nine days after meeting her, he proposed to her on a park bench in the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it in the garden of their home in Holland Park. Tony and Caroline had four children—Stephen, Hilary, Melissa, a feminist writer, and Joshua—and 10 grandchildren. Caroline Benn died of cancer on 22 November 2000, aged 74, after a career as an educationalist.

Two of Benn&#x27;s children have been active in Labour Party politics. His eldest son Stephen was an elected Member of the Inner London Education Authority from 1986 to 1990. His second son Hilary was a councillor in London, stood for Parliament in 1983 and 1987, and became Labour MP for Leeds Central in 1999. He was Secretary of State for International Development from 2003 to 2007, and then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until 2010, later serving as Shadow Foreign Secretary (2015–16). This makes him the third generation of his family to have been a member of the Cabinet, a rare distinction for a modern political family in Britain. Benn&#x27;s granddaughter Emily Benn was the Labour Party&#x27;s youngest-ever candidate when she failed to win East Worthing and Shoreham in 2010. Benn was a first cousin once removed of the actress Margaret Rutherford.

Benn and his wife Caroline became vegetarian in 1970, for ethical reasons, and remained so for the rest of their lives. Benn cited the decision of his son Hilary to become vegetarian as an important factor in his own decision to adopt a vegetarian diet.

==Early parliamentary career==
===Member of Parliament, 1950–1960===
Following the Second World War, Benn worked briefly as a BBC Radio producer. On 1 November 1950, he was selected to succeed Stafford Cripps as the Labour candidate for Bristol South East, after Cripps stood down because of ill-health. He won the seat in a by-election on 30 November 1950. Anthony Crosland helped him get the seat as he was the MP for nearby South Gloucestershire at the time. Upon taking the oath on 4 December 1950 Benn became &quot;Baby of the House&quot;, the youngest MP, for one day, being succeeded by Thomas Teevan, who was two years younger but took his oath a day later. He became the &quot;Baby&quot; again in 1951, when Teevan was not re-elected. In the 1950s, Benn held middle-of-the-road or soft left views, and was not associated with the young left wing group around Aneurin Bevan.

As MP for Bristol South East, Benn helped organise the 1963 Bristol Bus Boycott against the colour bar of the Bristol Omnibus Company against employing black and Asian drivers. Benn said that he would &quot;stay off the buses, even if I have to find a bike&quot;, and Labour leader Harold Wilson also told an anti-apartheid rally in London he was &quot;glad that so many Bristolians are supporting the [boycott] campaign&quot;, adding that he &quot;wish[ed] them every success&quot;.

===Peerage reform===
Benn&#x27;s father was created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill increased the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn&#x27;s elder brother Michael, then serving in the RAF, was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir-apparent to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.

In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn automatically became a peer, preventing him from sitting in the House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, who was at the time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.

Benn continued his campaign outside Parliament. Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had members in the same or similar situation to Benn&#x27;s (i.e., who were going to receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6 pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22 pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made at the time of his election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963.

Benn was a supporter of abolishing the House of Lords.

==In government, 1964–1970==

In the 1964 Government led by Harold Wilson, Benn was Postmaster General, where he oversaw the opening of the Post Office Tower, then the UK&#x27;s tallest building, and the creations of the Post Bus service and Girobank. He proposed issuing stamps without the monarch&#x27;s head, but this met with private opposition from Elizabeth II. Instead, the portrait was reduced to a small profile in silhouette, a format that is still used on commemorative stamps.

Benn also led the government&#x27;s opposition to the &quot;pirate&quot; radio stations broadcasting from international waters, which he was aware would be an unpopular measure. He claimed that some of these stations were causing interference to emergency radio used by shipping, although he was not responsible for introducing the Marine Broadcasting Offences Bill when it came before Parliament at the end of July 1966 for its first reading.

Earlier in the month, Benn was promoted to Minister of Technology, which included responsibility for the development of Concorde and the formation of International Computers Ltd. (ICL). The period also saw government involvement in industrial rationalisation, and the merger of several car companies to form British Leyland. Following Conservative MP Enoch Powell&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech to a Conservative Association meeting, in opposition to Harold Wilson&#x27;s insistence on not &quot;stirring up the Powell issue&quot;, Benn said during the 1970 general election campaign:

The mainstream press attacked Benn for using language deemed as intemperate as Powell&#x27;s language in his &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech (which was widely regarded as racist), and Benn noted in his diary that &quot;letters began pouring in on the Powell speech: 2:1 against me but some very sympathetic ones saying that my speech was overdue&quot;. Harold Wilson later reprimanded Benn for this speech, accusing him of losing Labour seats in the 1970 general election.

During the 1970s Benn publicly defended Marxism, saying:
Labour lost the 1970 election to Edward Heath&#x27;s Conservatives and upon Heath&#x27;s application to join the European Economic Community, a surge in left-wing Euroscepticism emerged. Benn &quot;was stridently against membership&quot;, and campaigned in favour of a referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership. The Shadow Cabinet voted to support a referendum on 29 March 1972, and as a result Roy Jenkins resigned as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.

==In government, 1974–1979==

In the Labour Government of 1974, Benn was Secretary of State for Industry and as such increased nationalised industry pay, provided better terms and conditions for workers such as the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and was involved in setting up worker cooperatives in firms which were struggling, the best known being at Meriden, outside Coventry, producing Triumph Motorcycles. In 1975, he was appointed Secretary of State for Energy, immediately following his unsuccessful campaign for a &quot;No&quot; vote in the referendum on the UK&#x27;s continued membership of the European Community (Common Market). Later in his diary, (25 October 1977) Benn wrote that he &quot;loathed&quot; the EEC; he claimed it was &quot;bureaucratic and centralised&quot; and &quot;of course it is really dominated by Germany. All the Common Market countries except the UK have been occupied by Germany, and they have this mixed feeling of hatred and subservience towards the Germans&quot;.

Harold Wilson resigned as Leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister in March 1976. Benn later attributed the collapse of the Wilson government to cuts enforced on the UK by global capital, in particular the International Monetary Fund. In the resulting leadership contest Benn finished in fourth place out of the six cabinet ministers who stood—he withdrew as 11.8 per cent of colleagues voted for him in the first ballot. Benn withdrew from the second ballot and endorsed Michael Foot; James Callaghan eventually won. Despite not receiving his support in the second and third rounds of the vote, Callaghan kept Benn on as Energy Secretary. In 1976, there was a sterling crisis, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey sought a loan from the International Monetary Fund. Underlining a wish to counter international market forces which seemed to penalise a larger welfare state, Benn publicly circulated the divided Cabinet minutes in which a narrow majority of the Labour Cabinet under Ramsay MacDonald supported a cut in unemployment benefits in order to obtain a loan from American bankers. As he highlighted, these minutes resulted in the 1931 split of the Labour Party in which MacDonald and his allies formed a National Government with Conservatives and Liberals. Callaghan allowed Benn to put forward the Alternative Economic Strategy, which consisted of a self-sufficient economy less dependent on low-rate fresh borrowing, but the AES, which according to opponents would have led to a &quot;siege economy&quot;, was rejected by the Cabinet. In response, Benn later recalled that: &quot;I retorted that their policy was a siege economy, only they had the bankers inside the castle with all our supporters left outside, whereas my policy would have our supporters in the castle with the bankers outside.&quot; Benn blamed the Winter of Discontent on these cuts to socialist policies.

Upon the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, Benn described Mao as &quot;one of the greatest—if not the greatest—figures of the twentieth century: a schoolteacher who transformed China, released it from civil war and foreign attack and constructed a new society there&quot; in his diaries, adding that &quot;he certainly towers above any twentieth-century figure I can think of in his philosophical contribution and military genius&quot;. On his trip to the Chinese embassy after Mao&#x27;s death, Benn recorded in an earlier volume of his diaries that he was &quot;a great admirer of Mao&quot;, while also admitting that &quot;he made mistakes, because everybody does&quot;.

During Benn&#x27;s time as energy minister from 1975 to 1979 he supported nuclear power in the United Kingdom. Later in his life he became an opponent of nuclear power, attributing his time as running it as a minister to persuading him it was not cheap, safe or peaceful. When asked in an interview in January 2009 on what he had changed his mind on over the course of his life he expanded on this issue by saying:

===Move to the left===

By the end of the 1970s, Benn&#x27;s views had shifted to the left wing of the Labour Party. He attributed this political shift to his experience as a Cabinet Minister in the 1964–1970 Labour Government. Benn ascribed his move to the left to four lessons:

# How &quot;the Civil Service can frustrate the policies and decisions of popularly elected governments&quot;
# The centralised nature of the Labour Party which allowed the Leader to run &quot;the Party almost as if it were his personal kingdom&quot;
# &quot;The power of industrialists and bankers to get their way by use of the crudest form of economic pressure, even blackmail, against a Labour Government&quot;
# The power of the media, which &quot;like the power of the medieval Church, ensures that events of the day are always presented from the point of the view of those who enjoy economic privilege&quot;

As regards the power of industrialists and bankers, Benn remarked:

Benn&#x27;s philosophy consisted of a form of syndicalism, state planning where necessary to ensure national competitiveness, greater democracy in the structures of the Labour Party and observance of Party Conference decisions. Alongside an alleged 12 Labour MPs, he spent 12 years affiliated with the Institute for Workers&#x27; Control, beginning in 1971 when he visited the Upper Clyde Shipyards, arguing in 1975 for the &quot;labour movement to intensify its discussion about industrial democracy&quot;.

He was vilified by most of the press while his opponents implied and stated that a Benn-led Labour Government would implement a type of Eastern European state socialism, with Edward Heath referring to Benn as &quot;Commissar Benn&quot; and others referring to Benn as a &quot;Bollinger Bolshevik&quot;. Despite this, Benn was overwhelmingly popular with Labour activists in the constituencies: a survey of delegates at the Labour Party Conference in 1978 found that by large margins they supported Benn for the leadership, as well as many Bennite policies.

He publicly supported Sinn Féin and the unification of Ireland, although in 2005 he suggested to Sinn Féin leaders that it abandon its long-standing policy of not taking seats at Westminster (abstentionism). Sinn Féin in turn argued that to do so would recognise Britain&#x27;s claim over Northern Ireland, and the Sinn Féin constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any British-created institution. A supporter of the Scottish Parliament and political devolution, Benn however opposed the Scottish National Party and Scottish independence, saying: &quot;I think nationalism is a mistake. And I am half Scots and feel it would divide me in half with a knife. The thought that my mother would suddenly be a foreigner would upset me very much.&quot;

In British politics during this period, the term &quot;Bennism&quot; came into use to describe the conviction politics, economic, social and political ideology of Tony Benn; and an exponent or advocate of Bennism was regarded as a &quot;Bennite&quot;.

==In opposition, 1979–1997==
In a keynote speech to the Labour Party Conference of 1980, shortly before the resignation of party leader James Callaghan and election of Michael Foot as successor, Benn outlined what he envisaged the next Labour Government would do. &quot;Within days&quot;, a Labour Government would gain powers to nationalise industries, control capital and implement industrial democracy; &quot;within weeks&quot;, all powers from Brussels would be returned to Westminster, and the House of Lords would be abolished by creating one thousand new peers and then abolishing the peerage. Benn received tumultuous applause. On 25 January 1981, Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers (known collectively as the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;) launched the Council for Social Democracy, which became the Social Democratic Party in March. The &quot;Gang of Four&quot; left the Labour Party because of what they perceived to be the influence of the Militant tendency and the Bennite &quot;hard left&quot; within the party. Benn was highly critical of the SDP, saying that &quot;Britain has had SDP governments for the past 25 years.&quot;
Benn stood against Denis Healey, the party&#x27;s incumbent deputy leader, triggering the 1981 deputy leadership election, disregarding an appeal from Michael Foot to either stand for the leadership or abstain from inflaming the party&#x27;s divisions. Benn defended his decision insisting that it was &quot;not about personalities, but about policies&quot;. The result was announced on 27 September 1981; Healey retained his position by a margin of barely one per cent. The decision of several soft left MPs, including Neil Kinnock, to abstain triggered the split of the Socialist Campaign Group from the left of the Tribune Group.
After Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in April 1982, Benn argued that the dispute should be settled by the United Nations and that the British Government should not send a task force to recapture the islands. The task force was sent, and following the Falklands War, they were back in British control by mid-June. In a debate in the Commons just after the Falklands were recaptured, Benn&#x27;s demand for &quot;a full analysis of the costs in life, equipment and money in this tragic and unnecessary war&quot; was rejected by Margaret Thatcher, who stated that &quot;he would not enjoy the freedom of speech that he put to such excellent use unless people had been prepared to fight for it&quot;.

For the 1983 election Benn&#x27;s Bristol South East constituency was abolished by boundary changes, and he lost to Michael Cocks in the selection of a candidate to stand in the new winnable seat of Bristol South. Rejecting offers from the new seat of Livingston in Scotland, Benn contested Bristol East, losing to the Conservative&#x27;s Jonathan Sayeed in June 1983. Foot resigned as leader following the defeat which reduced Labour to only 209 MPs, while Healey also decided to step down as deputy leader. However Benn&#x27;s absence from parliament meant that he was unable to stand in the resulting leadership contest as only MPs were eligible to be candidates. Benn&#x27;s absence from the contest was reported by &quot; The Glasgow Herald&quot; to leave Neil Kinnock as &quot;the favourite Left-wing candidate&quot;. Ultimately Kinnock won the contest, formally replacing Foot as party leader in October of that year.

In a by-election, Benn was elected as the MP for Chesterfield, the next Labour seat to fall vacant, after Eric Varley had left the Commons to head Coalite. On the day of the by-election, 1 March 1984, &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper ran a hostile feature article, &quot;Benn on the Couch&quot;, which purported to be the opinions of an American psychiatrist.

Newly elected to a mining seat, Benn was a supporter of the 1984–85 UK miners&#x27; strike, which was beginning when he returned to the Commons, and of his long-standing friend, the National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill. However, some miners considered Benn&#x27;s 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike; firstly, that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a &quot;regional matter&quot; in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been. Benn also spoke at a Militant tendency rally held in 1984, saying: &quot;The labour movement is not engaged in a personalised battle against individual cabinet ministers, nor do we seek to win public support by arguing that the crisis could be ended by the election of a new and more humane team of ministers who are better qualified to administer capitalism. We are working for a majority labour government, elected on a socialist programme, as decided by conference.&quot;

In June 1985, three months after the miners admitted defeat and ended their strike, Benn introduced the Miners&#x27; Amnesty (General Pardon) Bill into the Commons, which would have extended an amnesty to all miners imprisoned during the strike. This would have included two men convicted of murder (later reduced to manslaughter) for the killing of David Wilkie, a taxi driver driving a non-striking miner to work in South Wales during the strike.

Benn stood for election as party leader in 1988, against Neil Kinnock, following Labour&#x27;s third successive defeat in the 1987 general election, losing by a substantial margin, and received only about 11 per cent of the vote. In May 1989 he made an extended appearance on Channel 4&#x27;s late-night discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside among others Lord Dacre and Miles Copeland. During the Gulf War, Benn visited Baghdad in order to try to persuade Saddam Hussein to release the hostages who had been captured.

Benn supported various LGBT social movements, which were then known as gay liberation; Benn had voted in favour of decriminalisation in 1967. Talking about Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act, a piece of anti-gay legislation preventing the &quot;promotion of homosexuality&quot;, Benn said:

Benn later voted for the repeal of Section 28 during the first term of Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour Government, and voted in favour of equalising the age of consent.

In 1990, he proposed a &quot;Margaret Thatcher (Global Repeal) Bill&quot;, which he said &quot;could go through both Houses in 24 hours. It would be easy to reverse the policies and replace the personalities—the process has begun—but the rotten values that have been propagated from the platform of political power in Britain during the past 10 years will be an infection—a virulent strain of right-wing capitalist thinking which it will take time to overcome.&quot;

In 1991, with Labour still in opposition and a general election due by June 1992, he proposed the Commonwealth of Britain Bill, abolishing the monarchy in favour of the United Kingdom becoming a &quot;democratic, federal and secular commonwealth&quot;, a republic with a written constitution. It was read in Parliament a number of times until his retirement at the 2001 election, but never achieved a second reading. He presented an account of his proposal in &quot;Common Sense: A New Constitution for Britain&quot;.

The bill included the following:

* Abolishing the House of Lords
* Establishing a House of the People
* Lowering the voting age to 16
* Establishing a national parliament for England, Scotland and Wales
* Ending British rule in Northern Ireland
* The Church separated from the state
* Honours list reformed to recognise services to the community
* Confirmation of judges and election of magistrates
* No constitutional role for the monarchy (continue to live in Buckingham Palace)

In the same year, Benn also received a Pipe Smoker of the Year award, claiming in his acceptance speech that &quot;pipe smoking stopped you going to war&quot;.

In 1991, Benn reiterated his opposition to the European Commission and highlighted an alleged democratic deficit in the institution, saying: &quot;Some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the British Government, but we shall get it from Jacques Delors. They believe that a good king is better than a bad Parliament. I have never taken that view.&quot; This argument has also been used by many on the right-wing Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, such as Daniel Hannan MEP. Jonathan Freedland writes in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;For [Tony Benn], even benign rule by a monarch was worthless because the king&#x27;s whim could change and there&#x27;d be nothing you could do about it.&quot;

== Prior to retirement, 1997–2001 ==
In 1997, the Labour Party under the leadership of Tony Blair won the general election in a landslide, after 18 years of Conservative Party rule. Despite later calling Labour under Blair &quot;the idea of a Conservative group who had taken over Labour&quot; and saying that &quot;[Blair] set up a new political party, New Labour&quot;, his political diaries &quot;Free at Last&quot; show that Benn was initially somewhat sympathetic to Blair, welcoming a change of government. Benn supported the introduction of the national minimum wage, and welcomed the progress towards peace and security in Northern Ireland (particularly under Mo Mowlam). He was supportive of the extra money given to public services in the New Labour years but believed it to be under the guise of privatisation. Overall, his concluding judgement on New Labour is highly critical; he describes its evolution as a way of retaining office by abandoning socialism and distancing the party from the trade union movement, adopting a presidentialist style of politics, overriding the concept of the collective ministerial responsibility by reducing the power of the Cabinet, eliminated any effective influence from the annual conference of the Labour Party and &quot;hinged its foreign policy on support for one of the worst presidents in US history&quot;.

Benn strongly objected to the bombing of Iraq in December 1998, calling it immoral and saying: &quot;Aren&#x27;t Arabs terrified? Aren&#x27;t Iraqis terrified? Don&#x27;t Arab and Iraqi women weep when their children die? Doesn&#x27;t bombing strengthen their determination? ... Every Member of Parliament tonight who votes for the government motion will be consciously and deliberately accepting the responsibility for the deaths of innocent people if the war begins, as I fear it will.&quot; Benn also opposed the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

Several months prior to his retirement, Benn was a signatory to a letter, alongside Niki Adams (Legal Action for Women), Ian Macdonald, Gareth Peirce, and other legal professionals, that was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper on 22 February 2001 condemning raids of more than 50 brothels in the central London area of Soho. At the time, a police spokesman said: &quot;As far as we know, this is the biggest simultaneous crackdown on brothels and prostitution in this country in recent times&quot;, the arrest of 28 people in an operation that involved around 110 police officers. The letter read:

==Retirement and final years, 2001–2014==

Benn chose not to seek re-election at the 2001 general election, saying he was &quot;leaving parliament in order to spend more time on politics.&quot; Along with former Prime Minister Edward Heath, Benn was permitted by the Speaker to continue using the House of Commons Library and Members&#x27; refreshment facilities. Shortly after his retirement, he became the President of the Stop the War Coalition. He became a leading figure of the British opposition to the War in Afghanistan from 2001 and the Iraq War, and in February 2003 he travelled to Baghdad to meet Saddam Hussein. The interview was broadcast on British television.

He spoke against the war at the February 2003 protest in London organised by the Stop the War Coalition, with police saying it was the biggest ever demonstration in the UK with about 750,000 marchers, and the organisers estimating nearly a million people participating. In February 2004 and 2008, he was re-elected President of the Stop the War Coalition.

He toured with a one-man stage show and appeared a few times each year in a two-man show with folk singer Roy Bailey. In 2003, his show with Bailey was voted &#x27;Best Live Act&#x27; at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. In 2002, he opened the &quot;Left Field&quot; stage at the Glastonbury Festival. He continued to speak at each subsequent festival; attending one of his speeches was described as a &quot;Glastonbury rite of passage&quot;. In October 2003, he was a guest of British Airways on the last scheduled Concorde flight from New York to London. In June 2005, he was a panellist on a special edition of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; edited entirely by a school-age film crew selected by a BBC competition.

On 21 June 2005, Benn presented a programme on democracy as part of the Channel 5 series &quot;Big Ideas That Changed The World&quot;. He presented a left-wing view of democracy as the means to pass power from the &quot;wallet to the ballot&quot;. He argued that traditional social democratic values were under threat in an increasingly globalised world in which powerful institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Commission are unelected and unaccountable to those whose lives they affect daily.
On 27 September 2005, Benn became ill while attending the annual Labour Party Conference in Brighton and was taken by ambulance to the Royal Sussex County Hospital after being treated by paramedics on-the-scene at the Brighton Centre. Benn reportedly fell and struck his head. He was kept in hospital for observation and was described as being in a &quot;comfortable condition&quot;. He was subsequently fitted with an artificial pacemaker to help regulate his heartbeat.

In a list compiled by the magazine &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 2006, he was voted twelfth in the list of &quot;Heroes of our Time&quot;. In September 2006, Benn joined the &quot;Time to Go&quot; demonstration in Manchester the day before the final Labour Party Conference with Tony Blair as Leader of the Labour Party, with the aim of persuading the Government to withdraw troops from Iraq, to refrain from attacking Iran and to reject replacing the Trident missile and submarines with a new system. He spoke to the demonstrators in the rally afterwards. In 2007, he appeared in an extended segment in the Michael Moore film &quot;Sicko&quot; giving comments about democracy, social responsibility and healthcare, saying &quot;If we can find the money to kill people, we can find the money to help people.&quot; A poll by the BBC Two &quot;The Daily Politics&quot; programme in January 2007 selected Benn as the UK&#x27;s &quot;Political Hero&quot; with 38% of the vote, narrowly defeating Margaret Thatcher, who had 35%.

For the 2007 Labour Party leadership election, Benn backed the left-wing MP John McDonnell in his unsuccessful bid. In September 2007, Benn called for the government to hold a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty. In October 2007, aged 82, and when it appeared that a general election was about to be held, Benn reportedly announced that he wanted to stand, having written to his local Constituency Labour Party offering himself as a prospective candidate for the newly drawn Kensington seat. His main opponent would have been the incumbent Conservative MP for the predecessor seat of Kensington and Chelsea, Malcolm Rifkind. However, there was no election held in 2007, and so the boundary changes did not take effect until the eventual election in 2010, when Benn was not a candidate and the new seat was won by Rifkind.
In early 2008, Benn appeared on Scottish singer-songwriter Colin MacIntyre&#x27;s album &quot;The Water&quot;, reading a poem he had written himself. In September 2008, he appeared on the DVD release for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The War Machines&quot; with a vignette discussing the Post Office Tower; he became the second Labour politician, after Roy Hattersley to appear on a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; DVD.

At the Stop the War Conference 2009, he described the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as &quot;Imperialist war(s)&quot; and discussed the killing of American and allied troops by Iraqi or foreign insurgents, questioning whether they were in fact freedom fighters, and comparing the insurgents to a British Dad&#x27;s Army, saying: &quot;If you are invaded you have a right to self-defence, and this idea that people in Iraq and Afghanistan who are resisting the invasion are militant Muslim extremists is a complete bloody lie. I joined Dad&#x27;s Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I&#x27;d seen a German officer having a meal I&#x27;d have tossed a grenade through the window. Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist?&quot;

In an interview published in Dartford Living in September 2009, Benn was critical of the Government&#x27;s decision to delay the findings of the Iraq War Inquiry until after the general election, stating that &quot;people can take into account what the inquiry has reported on but they&#x27;ve deliberately pushed it beyond the election. Government is responsible for explaining what it has done and I don&#x27;t think we were told the truth.&quot; He also stated that local government was strangled by Margaret Thatcher and had not been liberated by New Labour.

In 2009, Benn was admitted to hospital and &quot;An Evening with Tony Benn&quot;, scheduled to take place at London&#x27;s Cadogan Hall, was cancelled. He performed his show, &quot;The Writing on the Wall&quot;, with Roy Bailey at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ashford, Kent, in September 2011, as part of the arts venue&#x27;s first Revelation St. Mary&#x27;s Season. In July 2011 Benn was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Glamorgan, Wales.
Benn headed the &quot;coalition of resistance&quot;, a group which was opposed to the UK austerity programme. In interviews in 2010 with Amy Goodman on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; and 2013 with Afshin Rattansi on &quot;RT UK&quot;, Benn claimed that the actions of New Labour in the leadup to and aftermath of the Iraq War were such that the former Prime Minister Tony Blair should be tried for war crimes. Benn also claimed in 2010 that Blair had lost the &quot;trust of the nation&quot; regarding the war in Iraq.

In 2012, Benn was awarded an honorary degree from Goldsmiths, University of London. He was also the honorary president of the Goldsmiths Students&#x27; Union, who successfully campaigned for him to retract comments dismissing the Julian Assange rape allegations. In February 2013, Benn was among those who gave their support to the People&#x27;s Assembly in a letter published by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. He gave a speech at the People&#x27;s Assembly Conference held at Westminster Central Hall on 22 June 2013.

Benn was consistently one of the most vocal critics of British membership of the European Union in Parliament, citing the EU&#x27;s &quot;democratic deficit&quot; as a main point of contempt. In 2013, Benn reiterated his previous opposition to European integration. Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by &quot;UKIP and Tory backbenchers&quot;, he said:

==Illness and death==
In 1990, Benn was diagnosed with chronic lymphatic leukaemia and given three or four years to live; at this time, he kept the news of his leukaemia from everyone except his immediate family. Benn said: &quot;When you&#x27;re in parliament, you can&#x27;t describe your medical condition. People immediately start wondering what your majority is and when there will be a by-election. They&#x27;re very brutal.&quot; This was revealed in 2002 with the release of his 1990–2001 diaries.

Benn had a stroke in 2012, and spent much of the following year in hospital. He was reported to be &quot;seriously ill&quot; in hospital in February 2014. Benn died at home on 14 March 2014, surrounded by his family, at the age of 88.

Benn&#x27;s funeral took place on 27 March 2014 at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster. His body had lain in rest at St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster the night before the funeral service. The service ended with the singing of &quot;The Red Flag&quot;. His body was then cremated; the ashes were expected to be buried alongside those of his wife at the family home near Steeple, Essex.

Figures from across the political spectrum praised Benn following his death, and the leaders of all three major political parties (the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats) in the United Kingdom paid tribute.

Conservative leader and Prime Minister David Cameron said:

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg called Benn an &quot;astonishing, iconic figure&quot; and a &quot;veteran parliamentarian, he was a great writer, he had great warmth and he had great conviction ... his political life will be looked back on with affection and admiration&quot;.

Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, who knew Benn personally as a family friend, said:

==Personal life==

Benn was a lifelong teetotaler and a vegetarian. He was known for his &quot;fondness for a mug of tea and a pipe&quot;, and Benn himself jokingly said that throughout his life he had drunk enough tea to &quot;float the QE2&quot;. In 2003, he participated in the Royal Society of Chemistry&#x27;s tasting event on how to make a cup of tea.

==Diaries and biographies==

Benn was a prolific diarist. Nine volumes of his diaries have been published. The final volume was published in 2013. Collections of his speeches and writings were published as &quot;Arguments for Socialism&quot; (1979), &quot;Arguments for Democracy&quot; (1981), (both edited by Chris Mullin), &quot;Fighting Back&quot; (1988) and (with Andrew Hood) &quot;Common Sense&quot; (1993), as well as &quot;Free Radical: New Century Essays&quot; (2004). In August 2003, London DJ Charles Bailey created an album of Benn&#x27;s speeches () set to ambient groove.

He made public several episodes of audio diaries he made during his time in Parliament and after retirement, entitled &quot;The Benn Tapes&quot;, broadcast originally on BBC Radio 4. Short series have been played periodically on BBC Radio 4 Extra. A major biography was written by Jad Adams and published by Macmillan in 1992; it was updated to cover the intervening 20 years and reissued by Biteback Publishing in 2011: &quot;Tony Benn: A Biography&quot; (). A more recent &quot;semi-authorised&quot; biography with a foreword by Benn was published in 2001: David Powell, &quot;Tony Benn: A Political Life&quot;, Continuum Books (). An autobiography, &quot;Dare to be a Daniel: Then and Now&quot;, Hutchinson (), a reference to the Old Testament prophet in the lions&#x27; den, was published in 2004.

There are substantial essays on Benn in the &quot;Dictionary of Labour Biography&quot; by Phillip Whitehead, Greg Rosen (eds), Politicos Publishing, 2001 () and in &quot;Labour Forces: From Ernie Bevin to Gordon Brown&quot;, Kevin Jefferys (ed.), I.B. Tauris Publishing, 2002 (). American Michael Moore dedicates his book &quot;Mike&#x27;s Election Guide 2008&quot; () to Benn, with the words: &quot;For Tony Benn, keep teaching us&quot;.

On 5 March 2019, it was announced that a large political archive of Benn&#x27;s speeches, diaries, letters, pamphlets, recordings and ephemera had been accepted in lieu of £210,000 inheritance tax and allocated to the British Library. The audio recordings total to thousands of hours of content.

==Plaques==
During his final years in Parliament, Benn placed three plaques within the Houses of Parliament. Two are in a room between the Central Lobby and Strangers&#x27; Gallery that holds a permanent display about the suffragettes. The first was placed in 1995. The second was placed in 1996 and is dedicated to all who work within the Houses of Parliament.

The third is dedicated to Emily Wilding Davison, who died for the cause of &quot;Votes for women&quot;, and was placed in the broom cupboard next to the Undercroft Chapel, where Davison is said to have hidden during the night of the 1911 census in order to establish her address as the House of Commons.

In 2011, Benn unveiled a plaque in Highbury, North London, to commemorate the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381.

==Legacy==

In Bristol, where Benn first served as a member of parliament, a number of tributes exist in his honour. A bust of him was unveiled in Bristol&#x27;s City Hall in 2005. In 2012 Transport House on Victoria Street, headquarters of Unite the Union&#x27;s regional office, was officially renamed Tony Benn House and opened by Benn himself. As of 2015 he appears, alongside other famous people associated with the city, on the reverse of the Bristol pound&#x27;s £B5 banknote.

Benn told the &quot;Socialist Review&quot; in 2007:

Benn was widely seen as a key proponent of democratic socialism. He was described as &quot;one of the few UK politicians to have become more left-wing after holding ministerial office&quot;. Harold Wilson, his former boss, maintained that Benn was the only man he knew who &quot;immatures with age&quot;.

He has been cited as being a key mentor to future leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn, with his Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell commenting that &quot;they would discuss everything under the sun. Jeremy was very close to Tony right up until the end.&quot; Corbyn was elected as leader of the Labour Party a little over a year after Benn&#x27;s death, an act which Hilary Benn said would have made his father feel &quot;thrilled&quot;.

<text>Omdurman () is a major city in Sudan. It is the second most populous city in the country, located in the State of Khartoum. Omdurman lies on the west bank of the River Nile, opposite and northwest of the capital city of Khartoum. It is on the Nile river and acts as an important road hub, with the Nile boosting transportation even further.

== Etymology ==
The name Omdurman (&quot;Umm Durmān&quot;) literally translates as &quot;Mother of Durmān&quot;, but who she was or might have been is unknown.

==History==

After the siege of Khartoum, followed by the building there of the tomb of the Mahdi after his death from typhus, the city grew rapidly. However, in the Battle of Omdurman in 1898 (which actually took place in the nearby village of Kerreri), Lord Kitchener decisively defeated the Mahdist forces. The following year British forces defeated Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, the Khalifa, as the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat; ensuring British control over the Sudan.

In September 1898, the British army of twenty thousand well drilled men equipped with the latest arms, Maxim guns and Martini-Henry rifles under the command of General Horatio Herbert Kitchener invaded Sudan. In the battle of Omdurman, the British Army faced Sudanese defenders consisting of over 52,000 poorly armed desert tribesmen dervishes; in the space of five hours the battle was over. The Sudanese defenders suffered many casualties, with at least 10,000 killed. By contrast there were fewer than four hundred casualties on the British side with forty-eight British soldiers losing their lives. Then, General Kitchener proceeded to order the desecration of the Mahdi&#x27;s tomb and in the words of Winston Churchill, &quot;carried off the Mahdi&#x27;s head in a kerosene can as a trophy&quot;.

Kitchener restored Khartoum as the capital and, from 1899 until 1956 Sudan was jointly governed by Great Britain and Egypt. Although most of the city was destroyed in the battle, the Mahdi&#x27;s tomb was restored and refurbished.

On 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group of the Justice and Equality Movement moved into the city where they engaged in heavy fighting with Sudanese government forces. Their goal was to topple Omar Hassan al-Bashir&#x27;s government.

During the Sudanese civil war, the Battle of Omdurman broke out.

Construction began in 2019 but as of 2021 had been suspended.

<doc id="100416" wikidata="Q486775" url="?curid=100416" title="Lynching">
<text>Lynching is an extrajudicial killing by a group. It is most often used to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an alleged or convicted transgressor or to intimidate others. It can also be an extreme form of informal group social control, and it is often conducted with the display of a public spectacle (often in the form of a hanging) for maximum intimidation. Instances of lynchings and similar mob violence can be found in all societies.

In the United States, where the word &quot;lynching&quot; likely originated, lynchings of African Americans became frequent in the South during the period after the Reconstruction era, especially during the nadir of American race relations.

==Etymology==
The origins of the word &quot;lynch&quot; are obscure, but it likely originated during the American Revolution. The verb comes from the phrase &quot;Lynch Law&quot;, a term for a punishment without trial. Two Americans during this era are generally credited for coining the phrase: Charles Lynch (1736–1796) and William Lynch (1742–1820), both of whom lived in Virginia in the 1780s. Charles Lynch is more likely to have coined the phrase, as he was known to have used the term in 1782, while William Lynch is not known to have used the term until much later. There is no evidence that death was imposed as a punishment by either of the two men. In 1782, Charles Lynch wrote that his assistant had administered Lynch&#x27;s law to Tories &quot;for Dealing with the negroes &amp;c&quot;.

Charles Lynch was a Virginia Quaker, planter, and Patriot who headed a county court in Virginia which imprisoned Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War, occasionally imprisoning them for up to a year. Although he lacked proper jurisdiction for detaining these persons, he claimed this right by arguing wartime necessity. Lynch was concerned that he might face legal action from one or more of those whom he had imprisoned, notwithstanding that the Patriots had won the war. In 1780, he persuaded the Continental Congress to pass Lynch&#x27;s Law to forgive extrajudicial wartime Loyalist imprisonment. It was in connection with this that the term &quot;Lynch law&quot;, meaning the assumption of extrajudicial authority, came into common parlance in the United States. Lynch was not accused of racist bias. He acquitted Black people accused of murder on three occasions. He was accused, however, of ethnic prejudice in his handling of Welsh miners.

William Lynch from Virginia claimed that the phrase was first used in a 1780 compact signed by him and his neighbors in Pittsylvania County. 

A 17th-century legend of James Lynch fitz Stephen, who was Mayor of Galway in Ireland in 1493, says that when his son was convicted of murder, the mayor hanged him from his own house. The story was proposed by 1904 as the origin of the word &quot;lynch&quot;. It is dismissed by etymologists, both because of the distance in time and place from the alleged event to the word&#x27;s later emergence, and because the incident did not constitute a lynching in the modern sense.

The archaic verb &quot;linch&quot;, to beat severely with a pliable instrument, to chastise or to maltreat, has been proposed as the etymological source; but there is no evidence that the word has survived into modern times, so this claim is also considered implausible.

Since the 1970s, and especially since the 1990s, there has been a false etymology claiming that the word lynching comes from a fictitious William Lynch speech that was given by an especially brutal slaveholder to other slaveholders to explain how to control their slaves. Although a real person named William Lynch might have been the origin of the word lynching, the real life William Lynch definitely did not give this speech, and it is unknown whether the real William Lynch even owned slaves at all.

==By country and region==
Lynchings took place in many parts of the world over the centuries.

===United States===

Lynchings took place in the United States both before and after the American Civil War, most commonly in Southern states and Western frontier settlements and most frequently in the late 19th century. They were often performed by self-appointed commissions, mobs, or vigilantes as a form of punishment for presumed criminal offenses. From 1883 to 1941 there were 4,467 victims of lynching. Of these, 4,027 were male, and 99 female. 341 were of unknown sex but are assumed to be likely male. In terms of ethnicity, 3,265 were black, 1,082 were white, 71 were Mexican or of Mexican descent, 38 were Native American, ten were Chinese, and one was Japanese. At the first recorded lynching, in St. Louis in 1835, a Black man named McIntosh who killed a deputy sheriff while being taken to jail was captured, chained to a tree, and burned to death on a corner lot downtown in front of a crowd of over 1,000 people.

Universal suffrage indicated the beginning of mass lynching across southern United States. The rise to mobs of outrage such as the &quot;red shirt&quot; bands began to appear in many southern states at the time of when voting became a right for black men, a key historical turn of events that gave uprise to lynching. Initially intended as scare tactics, this outrage continues to grow more and more violent to the point of men being take from their homes, beaten, exiled, and even assassinated. 
Mob violence arose as a means of enforcing White supremacy and frequently verged on systematic political terrorism. After the American Civil War, secret white supremacist terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, previously known as the &quot;red-shirt bands&quot;, instigated extrajudicial assaults and killings due to a perceived loss of white power in America. Mobs usually alleged crimes for which they lynched Black people in order to instill fear. In the late 19th century, however, journalist Ida B. Wells showed that many presumed crimes were either exaggerated or had not even occurred. The magnitude of the extralegal violence which occurred during election campaigns, to prevent blacks from voting, reached epidemic proportions. The ideology behind lynching was directly connected to the denial of political and social equality, as stated forthrightly in 1900 by United States Senator and former governor of South Carolina Benjamin Tillman: 

Members of mobs that participated in lynchings often took photographs of what they had done to their victims. Souvenir taking, such as the taking of pieces of rope, clothing, branches and sometimes body parts was not uncommon. Some of those photographs were published and sold as postcards.
====Anti-lynching legislation and the civil rights movement====
The Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill was first introduced to the United States Congress in 1918 by Republican Congressman Leonidas C. Dyer of St. Louis, Missouri. The bill was passed by the United States House of Representatives in 1922, and in the same year it was given a favorable report by the United States Senate Committee. Its passage was blocked by White Democratic senators from the Solid South, the only representatives elected since the southern states had disenfranchised African Americans around the start of the 20th century. The Dyer Bill influenced later anti-lynching legislation, including the Costigan-Wagner Bill, which was also defeated in the US Senate.

The song &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; was composed by Abel Meeropol in 1937, inspired by the photograph of a lynching in Marion, Indiana. Meeropol said of the photograph, &quot;It haunted me for days.&quot; It was published as a poem in the &quot;New York Teacher&quot; and later in the magazine &quot;New Masses&quot;, in both cases under the pseudonym Lewis Allan. The poem was set to music, also by Meeropol, and the song was performed and popularized by Billie Holiday. The song has been performed by many other singers, including Nina Simone.

By the 1950s, the civil rights movement was gaining new momentum. It was spurred by the lynching of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old youth from Chicago who was killed while visiting an uncle in Mississippi. His mother insisted on having an open-casket funeral so that people could see how badly her son had been beaten. The Black community throughout the U.S. became mobilized. Vann R. Newkirk wrote &quot;the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of white supremacy&quot;. The state of Mississippi tried two defendants, but they were acquitted by an all-white jury. David Jackson writes that it was the photograph of the &quot;child&#x27;s ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism.&quot;

Most lynchings ceased by the 1960s, but even in 2021 there were claims that racist lynchings still happen in the United States, being covered up as suicides.

In 2018, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice was opened in Montgomery, Alabama, a memorial that commemorates the victims of lynchings in the United States.

On March 29, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act of 2022 into law, which classified lynching as a federal hate crime.

===Europe===
In Liverpool, a series of race riots broke out in 1919 after the end of the First World War between White and Black sailors, many of whom had been demobilized. After a Black sailor had been stabbed by two White sailors in a pub for refusing to give them a cigarette, his friends attacked them the next day in revenge, wounding a policeman in the process. The police responded by launching raids on lodging houses in primarily Black neighborhoods, with casualties on both sides. A White lynch mob gathered outside the houses during the raids and chased a Black sailor, Charles Wootton, into the Mersey River where he drowned. The Charles Wootton College in Liverpool has been named in his memory.

In 1944, Wolfgang Rosterg, a German prisoner of war known to be unsympathetic to the Nazi regime, was lynched by other German prisoners of war in Cultybraggan Camp, a prisoner-of-war camp in Comrie, Scotland. At the end of the Second World War, five of the perpetrators were hanged at Pentonville Prison – the largest multiple execution in 20th-century Britain.

The situation is less clear with regards to reported &quot;lynchings&quot; in Germany. Nazi propaganda sometimes tried to depict state-sponsored violence as spontaneous lynchings. The most notorious instance of this was &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, which the government portrayed as the result of &quot;popular wrath&quot; against Jews, but it was carried out in an organized and planned manner, mainly by SA and SS men. Similarly, the approximately 150 confirmed murders of surviving crew members of crashed Allied aircraft in revenge for what Nazi propaganda called &quot;Anglo-American bombing terror&quot; were chiefly conducted by German officials and members of the police or the Gestapo, although civilians sometimes took part in them. The execution of enemy aircrew without trial in some cases had been ordered by Hitler personally in May 1944. It was publicly announced that enemy pilots would no longer be protected from &quot;public wrath&quot;. There were secret orders issued that prohibited policemen and soldiers from interfering in favor of the enemy in conflicts between civilians and Allied forces, or prosecuting civilians who engaged in such acts. In summary:

:...the assaults on crashed allied aviators were not typically acts of revenge for the bombing raids which immediately preceded them. [...] The perpetrators of these assaults were usually National Socialist officials, who did not hesitate to get their own hands dirty. The lynching murder in the sense of self-mobilizing communities or urban quarters was the exception.
On March 19, 1988, two plain-clothes British soldiers drove straight towards a Provisional IRA funeral procession near Milltown Cemetery in Andersonstown, Belfast. The men were mistaken for Special Air Service members, surrounded by the crowd, dragged out, beaten, kicked, stabbed and eventually shot dead at a waste ground.

Lynching of members of the Turkish Armed Forces occurred in the aftermath of the 2016 Turkish &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; attempt.

===Latin America===

====Mexico====
Lynchings have been present since the colonial period. Lynchings are a persistent form of extralegal violence in post-Revolutionary Mexico. A number of them have involved religious motivations. During and following the period of the Cristero War.

On September 14, 1968, five employees from the Autonomous University of Puebla were lynched in the village of San Miguel Canoa, in the state of Puebla, after Enrique Meza Pérez, the local priest, incited the villagers to murder the employees, who he believed were communists. The five victims intended to enjoy their holiday climbing La Malinche, a nearby mountain, but they had to stay in the village due to adverse weather conditions. Two of the employees, and the owner of the house where they were staying for the night, were killed; the three survivors sustained serious injuries, including finger amputations. The alleged main instigators were not prosecuted. The few arrested were released after no evidence was found against them.

On November 23, 2004, in the Tláhuac lynching, three Mexican undercover federal agents investigating a narcotics-related crime were lynched in the town of San Juan Ixtayopan (Mexico City) by an angry crowd who saw them taking photographs and suspected that they were trying to abduct children from a primary school. The agents immediately identified themselves, but they were held and beaten for several hours before two of them were killed and set on fire. The incident was covered by the media almost from the beginning, including their pleas for help and their murder.

By the time police rescue units arrived, two of the agents were reduced to charred corpses and the third was seriously injured. Authorities suspect that the lynching was provoked by the persons who were being investigated. Both local and federal authorities had abandoned the agents, saying that the town was too far away for them to try to intervene. Some officials said they would provoke a massacre if the authorities tried to rescue the men from the mob.

====Brazil====
According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Over the past 60 years, as many as 1.5 million Brazilians have taken part in lynchings...In Brazil, mobs now kill—or try to kill—more than one suspected lawbreaker a day, according to University of São Paulo sociologist José de Souza Martins, Brazil&#x27;s leading expert on lynchings.&quot;

====Dominican Republic====
Extrajudicial punishment, including lynching, of alleged criminals who committed various crimes, ranging from theft to murder, has some endorsement in Dominican society. According to a 2014 Latinobarómetro survey, the Dominican Republic had the highest rate of acceptance in Latin America of such unlawful measures. These issues are particularly evident in the Northern Region.

====Haiti====
After the 2010 earthquake the slow distribution of relief supplies and the large number of affected people created concerns about civil unrest, marked by looting and mob justice against suspected looters. In a 2010 news story, CNN reported, &quot;At least 45 people, most of them Vodou priests, have been lynched in Haiti since the beginning of the cholera epidemic by angry mobs blaming them for the spread of the disease, officials said.

===Africa===
====South Africa====

The practice of whipping and necklacing offenders and political opponents evolved in the 1980s during the apartheid era in South Africa. Residents of Black townships formed &quot;people&#x27;s courts&quot; and used whip lashings and deaths by necklacing in order to terrorize fellow Blacks who were seen as collaborators with the government. Necklacing is the torture and execution of a victim by igniting a kerosene-filled rubber tire that has been forced around the victim&#x27;s chest and arms. Necklacing was used to punish victims who were alleged to be traitors to the Black liberation movement along with their relatives and associates. Sometimes the &quot;people&#x27;s courts&quot; made mistakes, or they used the system to punish those whom the anti-Apartheid movement&#x27;s leaders opposed. A tremendous controversy arose when the practice was endorsed by Winnie Mandela, then the wife of the then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela and a senior member of the African National Congress.

In 1996, Rashaad Staggie was killed by a crowd of People Against Gangsterism and Drugs members.

====Nigeria====
The practice of extrajudicial punishments, including lynching, is referred to as &#x27;jungle justice&#x27; in Nigeria. The practice is widespread and &quot;an established part of Nigerian society&quot;, predating the existence of the police. Exacted punishments vary between a &quot;muddy treatment&quot;, that is, being made to roll in the mud for hours and severe beatings followed by necklacing. The case of the &quot;Aluu four&quot; sparked national outrage. The absence of a functioning judicial system and law enforcement, coupled with corruption are blamed for the continuing existence of the practice.

====Kenya====
There are frequent lynchings in Kenya, often as a mob executes a person they feel is guilty. McKee (2024) is written largely with reference to a Kenya Lynchings Database that includes reports of over 3,100 lynched persons for Kenya for the years ca. 1980–2024. That number, however, is just a fraction of the total for that period, which may well exceed 10,000.

===Palestine and Israel===

Palestinian lynch mobs have murdered Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. According to a Human Rights Watch report from 2001:
On October 12, 2000, the Ramallah lynching took place. This happened at the el-Bireh police station, where a Palestinian crowd killed and mutilated the bodies of two Israel Defense Forces reservists, Vadim Norzhich (Nurzhitz) and Yosef &quot;Yossi&quot; Avrahami, who had accidentally entered the Palestinian Authority-controlled city of Ramallah in the West Bank and were taken into custody by Palestinian Authority policemen. The Israeli reservists were beaten and stabbed. At this point, a Palestinian (later identified as Aziz Salha), appeared at the window, displaying his blood-soaked hands to the crowd, which erupted into cheers. The crowd clapped and cheered as one of the soldier&#x27;s bodies was then thrown out the window and stamped and beaten by the frenzied crowd. One of the two was shot, set on fire, and his head beaten to a pulp. Soon after, the crowd dragged the two mutilated bodies to Al-Manara Square in the city center and began an impromptu victory celebration. Police officers proceeded to try and confiscate footage from reporters.

On October 18, 2015, an Eritrean asylum seeker, Haftom Zarhum, was lynched by a mob of vengeful Israeli soldiers in Be&#x27;er Sheva&#x27;s central bus station. Israeli security forces misidentified Haftom as the person who shot an Israeli police bus and shot him. Moments after, other security forces joined shooting Haftom when he was bleeding on the ground. Then, a soldier hit him with a bench nearby when two other soldiers approached the victim then forcefully kicked his head and upper body. Another soldier threw a bench over him to prevent his movement. At that moment a bystander pushed the bench away, but the security forces put back the chair and kicked the victim again and pushed the stopper away. Israeli medical forces did not evacuate the victim until eighteen minutes after the first shooting although the victim received 8 shots. In January 2016 four security forces were charged in connection with the lynching. The Israeli civilian who was involved in lynching the Eritrean civilian was sentenced to 100 days community service and 2,000 shekels.

In August 2012, seven Israeli youths were arrested in Jerusalem for what several witnesses described as an attempted lynching of several Palestinian teenagers. The Palestinians received medical treatment and judicial support from Israeli facilities.

===South Asia===

====India====

In India, lynchings may reflect internal tensions between ethnic communities. Communities sometimes lynch individuals who are accused or suspected of committing crimes. Sociologists and social scientists reject attributing racial discrimination to the caste system and attributed such events to intra-racial ethno-cultural conflicts.

There have been numerous lynchings in relation to cow vigilante violence in India since 2014, mainly involving Hindu mobs lynching Indian Muslims. Some notable examples of such attacks include the 2015 Dadri mob lynching, the 2016 Jharkhand mob lynching, 2017 Alwar mob lynching. and the 2019 Jharkhand mob lynching. Mob lynching was reported for the third time in Alwar in July 2018, when a group of cow vigilantes killed a 31-year-old Muslim man named Rakbar Khan.

In 2006, four members of a Dalit family were slaughtered by Kunbi caste members in khairlanji, a village in the Bhandara district of Maharashtra.

In the 2015 Dimapur mob lynching, a mob in Dimapur, Nagaland, broke into a jail and lynched an accused rapist on March 5, 2015, while he was awaiting trial.

Since May 2017, when seven people were lynched in Jharkhand, India has experienced another spate of mob-related violence and killings known as the Indian WhatsApp lynchings following the spread of fake news, primarily relating to child-abduction and organ harvesting, via the WhatsApp message service.

In 2018 Junior civil aviation minister of India had garlanded and honored eight men who had been convicted in the lynching of trader Alimuddin Ansari in Ramgarh in June 2017 in a case of alleged cow vigilantism.

In June 2019, the Jharkhand mob lynching triggered widespread protests. The victim was a Muslim man named Tabrez Ansari and was forced to chant Hindu slogans, including &quot;Jai Shri Ram&quot;.

In July 2019, three men were beaten to death and lynched by mobs in Chhapra district of Bihar, on a minor case of theft of cattle.

Also in 2019, villagers in Jharkhand lynched four people on witchcraft suspicion, after panchayat decided that they were practicing black magic.

in September 2024, in Hayarna, Five men were members of a cow vigilante group that murdered 24-year-old Sabir Malik from West Bengal. 

====Afghanistan====

On March 19, 2015, in Kabul, Afghanistan a large crowd beat a young woman, Farkhunda, after she was accused by a local mullah of burning a copy of the Quran, Islam&#x27;s holy book. Shortly afterwards, a crowd attacked her and beat her to death. They set the young woman&#x27;s body on fire on the shore of the Kabul River. Although it was unclear whether the woman had burned the Quran, police officials and the clerics in the city defended the lynching, saying that the crowd had a right to defend their faith at all costs. They warned the government against taking action against those who had participated in the lynching. The event was filmed and shared on social media. The day after the incident six men were arrested on accusations of lynching, and Afghanistan&#x27;s government promised to continue the investigation. On March 22, 2015, Farkhunda&#x27;s burial was attended by a large crowd of Kabul residents; many demanded that she receive justice. A group of Afghan women carried her coffin, chanted slogans and demanded justice.

===Oceania===
====Papua New Guinea====
A series of high-profile lynchings took place in Papua New Guinea in the late 1970s, in the period following independence. In September 1978, Morris Modeda, a 30-year-old man on trial for dangerous driving causing death, was lynched by a mob of 100 people near the town of Bereina. The lynching took place in front of William Prentice, the Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea, who had adjourned the trial to allow the court to view the site of the accident. Modeda was &quot;battered to death with stones, sticks and a bushknife&quot;, while Prentice, his wife, and the court party – including barristers, court officials, witnesses and policemen – were &quot;roughly handled but were not injured&quot;. Another prisoner was lynched in the same month in Kainantu while being escorted from a courthouse, receiving axe wounds in the head and chest. Days later, the police station at Banz in the Western Highlands was raided by a mob which freed 50 prisoners and bludgeoned to death a man who had been involved in a fatal car accident.

In 1979, Prentice and his fellow Supreme Court judges delivered the Special Report on the Developing State of Lawlessness to the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea. The report called on &quot;urgent action to end police and prison staff inefficiency, ignorance and lack of discipline&quot; and called for further support from traditional leaders.

<text>Casamance is the area of Senegal south of the Gambia, including the Casamance River. It consists of the Lower Casamance (, —i.e. Ziguinchor Region) and the Upper Casamance (, —i.e. Kolda and Sédhiou Regions). The largest city of Casamance is Ziguinchor.

== Etymology ==
Because this southern region of Senegal boasts a coastline that was early visited by Portuguese navigators, there has long been speculation about a Lusophone influence in its name. In his Wolof-French Dictionary published in 1923 by the Catholic Mission of Dakar, Aloyse Kobès provides the following definition: &quot;Kasamansa (Casamance), derived from (Portuguese), meaning house, dwelling, and &quot;mansa&quot; (Mandingo), meaning king, chief.&quot;

== Peoples ==
Casamance is mainly inhabited by the Jola and Bainuk. Significant minority populations include the Balanta, Mande and Fulani. Casamance is religiously diverse, with the inhabitants practicing Islam, Christianity, and traditional African religions.

==History==

According to local legends, the Jola and Bainuk people are said to have inhabited Casamance for over a thousand years. Jola leaders ruled portions of Casamance, frequently under the nominal rule of Wolof and Serer kingdoms to the north. From the 15th to 18th century, the Bainuk Kasa kingdom located in the Lower Casamance was the dominant state in the south. In the 15th century, Portuguese slave traders and navigators established a trading station in the area. They also formed trade relations with local Jola chiefs and the king of Kasa.

The Casamance was subject to both French and Portuguese colonial efforts before a border was negotiated in 1888 between the French colony of Senegal and Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau) to the south. Portugal lost possession of Casamance, then the commercial hub of its colony. Casamance, to this day, has preserved the local variant of Upper Guinea Creole known as Casamance Creole, and the members of the deep-rooted Creole community carry Portuguese surnames like Da Silva, Carvalho and Fonseca. The historical ties to Portugal were a factor in Senegal&#x27;s decision to seek membership of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), becoming an associate observer in 2008. Interest in Portuguese heritage has been revived in order to exert a distinct identity, particularly in Baixa Casamança.

Bissau-Guineans are also present in the region, as expatriates, immigrants, and refugees from the poverty and instability that since long affects the neighbouring country, including the 1998–1999 Guinea-Bissau Civil War.

===Separatist movement===
Though the Jola are the dominant ethnic group in the Casamance, they represent only 4% of the total population of Senegal. The Jola&#x27;s sense of economic disenfranchisement within greater Senegal contributed to the founding of a separatist movement advocating the independence or autonomous administrative division of the Casamance, the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC), in 1982.

The MFDC&#x27;s armed wing was established in 1985, and in 1990 the Casamance conflict began: a low-level insurgency led by the MFDC against the government of Senegal. The conflict has been characterized by sporadic violence and frequent but unstable ceasefire agreements. An illegal shipment of weapons hailing from Iran was seized in Lagos, Nigeria in October 2010, and the Senegalese government suspected the MFDC of having been the intended recipient of the weapons. Senegal recalled its ambassador to Tehran over the incident.

==Geography and climate==

The region is low-lying and hot, with some hills to the southeast. The entire Casamance region experiences a tropical savanna climate, with average rainfall greater than the rest of Senegal. The region is like the rest of Senegal: rainless from November to May, but during the rainy season from June to October, most areas receive over , and the furthest southwest as much as .

==Economy==
The economy of the Casamance relies largely on rice cultivation and tourism. It also has excellent beaches along its coastline, particularly at Cap Skirring.

==Ecology==
Tree cover in Casamance is severely threatened by illegal logging.

<doc id="100422" wikidata="Q1401251" url="?curid=100422" title="Profumo affair">
<text>The Profumo affair was a major scandal in British politics during the early 1960s. John Profumo, the 46-year-old Secretary of State for War in Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative government, had an extramarital affair with the 19-year-old model Christine Keeler beginning in 1961. Profumo denied the affair in a statement to the House of Commons in 1963; weeks later, a police investigation proved that he had lied. The scandal severely damaged the credibility of Macmillan&#x27;s government, and Macmillan resigned as Prime Minister in October 1963, citing ill health. The fallout contributed to the Conservative government&#x27;s defeat by the Labour Party in the 1964 general election.

When the Profumo affair was revealed, public interest was heightened by reports that Keeler may have been simultaneously involved with Captain Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet naval attaché, thereby creating a possible national security risk. Keeler knew both Profumo and Ivanov through her friendship with Stephen Ward, an osteopath and socialite who had taken her under his wing. The exposure of the affair generated rumours of other sex scandals and drew official attention to the activities of Ward, who was charged with a series of immorality offences. Perceiving himself as a scapegoat for the misdeeds of others, Ward took a fatal overdose during the final stages of his trial, which found him guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies.

An inquiry into the Profumo affair by a senior judge, Lord Denning, assisted by a senior civil servant, T. A. Critchley, concluded that there had been no breaches of security arising from the Ivanov connection. Denning&#x27;s report was later described as superficial and unsatisfactory. Profumo subsequently worked as a volunteer at Toynbee Hall, an East London charitable trust. By 1975 he had been officially rehabilitated, although he did not return to public life. He died, honoured and respected, in 2006. By contrast, Keeler found it difficult to escape the negative image attached to her by press, law, and parliament throughout the scandal. In various, sometimes contradictory, accounts, she challenged Denning&#x27;s conclusions relating to security issues. Ward&#x27;s conviction has been described by analysts as an act of establishment revenge, rather than serving justice. In the 2010s the Criminal Cases Review Commission reviewed his case but decided against referring it to the Court of Appeal. Dramatisations of the Profumo affair have been shown on stage and screen.

==Background==
===Government and press===
In the early 1960s, the British news media were dominated by several high-profile spying stories: the breaking of the Portland spy ring in 1961, the capture and sentencing of George Blake in the same year and, in 1962, the case of John Vassall, a homosexual Admiralty clerk who had been blackmailed into spying by the Soviet Union. Vassall was subsequently sentenced to eighteen years in prison. After suggestions in the press that Vassall had been shielded by his political masters, the responsible minister, Thomas Galbraith, resigned from the government pending inquiries. Galbraith was later exonerated by the Vassall Tribunal, after which judge Lord Radcliffe sent two newspaper journalists to prison for refusing to reveal their sources for sensational and uncorroborated stories about Vassall&#x27;s private life. The imprisonment severely damaged relations between the press and the Conservative government of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan; columnist Paul Johnson of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; warned, &quot;any Tory minister or MP ... who gets involved in a scandal during the next year or so must expect—I regret to say—the full treatment&quot;.

===John Profumo===
John Profumo was born in 1915 and was of Italian descent. He first entered Parliament in 1940 as the Conservative member for Kettering while serving with the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, and combined his political and military duties through the Second World War. Profumo lost his seat in the 1945 general election but was elected again in 1950 for Stratford-on-Avon. From 1951 he held junior ministerial office in successive Conservative administrations.

In 1960, Macmillan promoted Profumo to Secretary of State for War, a senior post outside the Cabinet. After his marriage in 1954 to Valerie Hobson, one of Britain&#x27;s leading film actresses, Profumo may have conducted casual affairs, using late-night parliamentary sittings as his cover. His tenure as war minister coincided with a period of transition in the armed forces, involving the end of conscription and the development of a wholly professional army. Profumo&#x27;s performance was watched with a critical eye by his opposition counterpart George Wigg, a former regular soldier.

===Christine Keeler, Mandy Rice-Davies, and Lord Astor===

Christine Keeler, born in Uxbridge in 1942, left school at age 15 with no qualifications and took a series of short-lived jobs in shops, offices and cafés. She aspired to be a model, and at age 16 had a photograph published in &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; magazine. In August 1959, Keeler found work as a topless showgirl at Murray&#x27;s Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho. This long-established club attracted a distinguished clientèle of whom, Keeler wrote, they &quot;could look but could not touch&quot;.

Shortly after starting at Murray&#x27;s, Keeler was introduced to a client, the society osteopath Stephen Ward. Captivated by Ward&#x27;s charm, she agreed to move into his flat, in a relationship she has described as &quot;like brother and sister&quot;—affectionate but not sexual. Keeler left Ward after a few months to become the mistress of the property dealer Peter Rachman, and later shared lodgings with Mandy Rice-Davies, a fellow Murray&#x27;s dancer two and a half years her junior. The two girls left Murray&#x27;s and attempted without success to pursue careers as freelance models. Keeler also lived for short periods with various boyfriends, but regularly returned to Ward, who had acquired a house in Wimpole Mews, Marylebone. There she met many of Ward&#x27;s friends, among them Lord Astor, a long-time patient who was also a political ally of Profumo. She often spent weekends at a riverside cottage that Ward rented on Astor&#x27;s country estate, Cliveden, in Buckinghamshire.

===Stephen Ward and Yevgeny Ivanov===
Stephen Ward, born in Hertfordshire in 1912, qualified as an osteopath in the United States. After the Second World War he began practising in Cavendish Square, London, where he rapidly established a good reputation and attracted many distinguished patients. These connections, together with his personal charm, brought him considerable social success. In his spare time, Ward attended art classes at the Slade school, and developed a profitable sideline in portrait sketches. In 1960 he was commissioned by &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; to provide a series of portraits of national and international figures. These included members of the Royal Family, among them Prince Philip and Princess Margaret.

Ward hoped to visit the Soviet Union to draw portraits of Russian leaders. To help him, one of his patients, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; editor Sir Colin Coote, arranged an introduction to Captain Yevgeny Ivanov (anglicised as &quot;Eugene&quot;), listed as a naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy. British Intelligence (MI5) knew from the double agent Oleg Penkovsky that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Soviet GRU. Ward and Ivanov became firm friends. Ivanov frequently visited Ward at Wimpole Mews, where he met Keeler and Rice-Davies, and sometimes joined Ward&#x27;s weekend parties at Cliveden.

MI5 considered Ivanov a potential defector and sought Ward&#x27;s help to this end, providing him with a case officer known as &quot;Woods&quot;. Ward was later used by the Foreign Office as a backchannel, through Ivanov, to the Soviet Union, and was involved in unofficial diplomacy during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Ward&#x27;s closeness to Ivanov raised concerns about his loyalty; according to Lord Denning&#x27;s September 1963 report, Ivanov often asked Ward questions about British foreign policy, and Ward did his best to provide answers.

==Origins==
===Cliveden, July 1961===

During the weekend of 8–9 July 1961, Keeler was among several guests of Ward at the Spring Cottage at Cliveden. That same weekend, at the main house, Profumo and his wife Valerie were among the large gathering from the worlds of politics and the arts which Astor was hosting in honour of Pakistani President Ayub Khan. On the Saturday evening, Ward&#x27;s and Astor&#x27;s parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use. Keeler, who had been swimming naked, was introduced to Profumo while trying to cover herself with a skimpy towel. She was, Profumo informed his son many years later, &quot;a very pretty girl and very sweet&quot;. Keeler did not initially know who Profumo was, but was impressed that he was the husband of a famous film star and was prepared to have &quot;a bit of fun&quot; with him.

The next afternoon the two parties reconvened at the pool and were joined by Ivanov, who had arrived that morning. There followed what Lord Denning described as &quot;a light-hearted and frolicsome bathing party, where everyone was in bathing costumes and nothing indecent took place at all&quot;. Profumo was greatly attracted to Keeler, and promised to be in touch with her. Ward asked Ivanov to accompany Keeler back to London where, according to Keeler, they had sex. Some commentators doubt this—Keeler was generally outspoken about her sexual relationships yet said nothing openly about sex with Ivanov until she informed a newspaper eighteen months later.

On 12 July 1961, Ward reported on the weekend&#x27;s events to MI5. He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated that he had been asked by Ivanov for information about the future arming of West Germany with nuclear weapons. This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions. Profumo&#x27;s interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in MI5&#x27;s plans to use her in a honey trap operation against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5&#x27;s director-general, Sir Roger Hollis.

===Affair===
A few days after the Cliveden weekend, Profumo contacted Keeler. The affair that ensued was brief; some commentators have suggested that it ended after a few weeks, while others believe that it continued, with decreasing fervour, until December 1961. The relationship was characterised by Keeler as an unromantic relationship without expectations, a &quot;screw of convenience&quot;, although she also states that Profumo hoped for a longer-term commitment and that he offered to set her up in a flat. More than twenty years later, Profumo described Keeler in conversation with his son as someone who &quot;seem[ed] to like sexual intercourse&quot;, but who was &quot;completely uneducated&quot;, with no conversation beyond make-up, hair and gramophone records.

The couple usually met at Wimpole Mews, when Ward was absent, although once, when Hobson was away, Profumo took Keeler to his home at Chester Terrace in Regent&#x27;s Park. On one occasion he borrowed a Bentley from his ministerial colleague John Hare and took Keeler for a drive around London, and another time the couple had a drink with Viscount Ward, the former Secretary of State for Air. During their time together, Profumo gave Keeler a few small presents, and once, a sum of £20 as a gift for her mother. Keeler maintains that although Ward asked her to obtain information from Profumo about the deployment of nuclear weapons, she did not do so. Profumo was equally adamant that no such discussions took place.

On 9 August, Profumo was interviewed informally by Sir Norman Brook, the Cabinet Secretary, who had been advised by Hollis of Profumo&#x27;s involvement with Ward&#x27;s group. Brook warned the minister of the dangers of being entangled with Ward since MI5 were at this stage unsure of his dependability. It is possible that Brook asked Profumo to help MI5 in its efforts to secure Ivanov&#x27;s defection—a request which Profumo declined. Although Brook did not indicate knowledge of the relationship with Keeler, Profumo may have suspected that he knew. That same day, Profumo wrote Keeler a letter, beginning &quot;Darling ...&quot;, cancelling an assignation they had made for the following day. Some commentators have assumed that this letter ended the association; Keeler insisted that the affair ended later, after her persistent refusals to stop living with Ward.

==Developing scandal==
===Gordon and Edgecombe===

In October 1961 Keeler accompanied Ward to Notting Hill, then a run-down district of London replete with West Indian music clubs and cannabis dealers. At the Rio Café they encountered Aloysius &quot;Lucky&quot; Gordon, a Jamaican jazz singer with a history of violence and petty crime. Gordon and Keeler embarked on an affair which, in her own accounts, was marked by equal measures of violence and tenderness on his part. Gordon became very possessive, jealous of Keeler&#x27;s other social contacts. He began confronting her friends and often telephoned her at unsocial hours. In November Keeler left Wimpole Mews and moved to a flat in Dolphin Square, overlooking the Thames at Pimlico, where she entertained friends. When Gordon continued to harass Keeler he was arrested by the police and charged with assault. Keeler later agreed to drop the charge.

In July 1962 the first inklings of a possible Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov triangle had been hinted at, in coded terms, in the gossip column of the society magazine &quot;Queen&quot;. Under the heading, &quot;Sentences I&#x27;d like to hear the end of&quot; appeared the wording: &quot;... called in MI5 because every time the chauffeur-driven Zils drew up at her &quot;front&quot; door, out of her &quot;back&quot; door into a chauffeur-driven Humber slipped...&quot; Keeler was then in New York City with Rice-Davies, in an abortive attempt to launch their modelling careers there. On her return to London in September 1962, to counter Gordon&#x27;s threats, Keeler met and formed a relationship with Johnny Edgecombe, an ex-merchant seaman from Antigua, with whom she lived for a while in Brentford, just west of London. Edgecombe became similarly possessive himself after he and Gordon clashed violently on 27 October 1962, when Edgecombe slashed his rival&#x27;s face with a knife. Keeler broke up with Edgecombe shortly afterwards because of his domineering behaviour.

On the afternoon of 14 December 1962, Keeler and Rice-Davies were together at Ward&#x27;s house at 17 Wimpole Mews when Edgecombe arrived, demanding to see Keeler. When he was not allowed in, he fired several shots at the front door. Shortly afterwards, Edgecombe was arrested and charged with attempted murder and other offences. In brief press accounts, Keeler was described as &quot;a free-lance model&quot; and &quot;Miss Marilyn Davies&quot; as &quot;an actress&quot;. In the wake of the incident, Keeler began to talk indiscreetly about Ward, Profumo, Ivanov and the Edgecombe shooting. Among those to whom she told her story was John Lewis, a former Labour MP whom she had met by chance in a night club. Lewis, a long-standing enemy of Ward, passed the information to Wigg, his one-time parliamentary colleague, who began his own investigation.

===Mounting pressures===
On 22 January 1963 the Soviet government, sensing a possible scandal, recalled Ivanov. Aware of increasing public interest, Keeler attempted to sell her story to the national newspapers. The Radcliffe tribunal&#x27;s ongoing inquiry into press behaviour during the Vassall case was making newspapers nervous, and only two showed interest in Keeler&#x27;s story: the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; and the &quot;News of the World&quot;. As the latter would not join an auction, Keeler accepted the &quot;Pictorial&quot;″s offer of a £200 down payment and a further £800 when the story was published. The &quot;Pictorial&quot; retained a copy of the &quot;Darling&quot; letter. Meanwhile, the &quot;News of the World&quot; alerted Ward and Astor—whose names had been mentioned by Keeler—and they in turn informed Profumo. When Profumo&#x27;s lawyers tried to persuade Keeler not to publish, the compensation she demanded was so large that they considered charges of extortion. Ward informed the &quot;Pictorial&quot; that Keeler&#x27;s story was largely false and threatened to sue if it was printed, whereupon the paper withdrew its offer, although Keeler kept the £200.

Keeler then gave details of her affair with Profumo to a police officer, who did not pass on this information to MI5 or the legal authorities. By this time, many of Profumo&#x27;s political colleagues had heard rumours of his entanglement, and of the existence of a potentially incriminating letter. Nevertheless, his denials were accepted by the government&#x27;s principal law officers and the Conservative Chief Whip, although with some private scepticism. Macmillan, mindful of the injustice done to Galbraith on the basis of rumours, was determined to support his minister and took no action.

Edgecombe&#x27;s trial began on 14 March but Keeler, one of the Crown&#x27;s key witnesses, was missing. She had, without informing the court, gone to Spain, although at this stage her whereabouts were unknown. Her unexplained absence caused a press sensation. Every newspaper knew the rumours linking Keeler with Profumo, but refrained from reporting any direct connection; in the wake of the Radcliffe inquiry they were, in Wigg&#x27;s later words, &quot;willing to wound but afraid to strike&quot;. They could only hint, by front-page juxtapositions of stories and photographs, that Profumo might be connected to Keeler&#x27;s disappearance. Despite Keeler&#x27;s absence the judge proceeded with the case; Edgecombe was found guilty on a lesser charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, and sentenced to seven years&#x27; imprisonment. A few days after the trial, on 21 March, the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; printed the most detailed summary so far of the rumours, with the main characters lightly disguised: &quot;Mr James Montesi&quot;, &quot;Miss Gaye Funloving&quot;, &quot;Dr Spook&quot; and &quot;Vladimir Bolokhov&quot;.

===Personal statement===
The newly elected leader of the opposition Labour Party, Harold Wilson, was initially advised by his colleagues to have nothing to do with Wigg&#x27;s private dossier on the Profumo rumours. On 21 March, with the press furore over the &quot;missing witness&quot; at its height, the party changed its stance. During a House of Commons debate, Wigg used parliamentary privilege to ask the Home Secretary to categorically deny the truth of rumours connecting &quot;a minister&quot; to Keeler, Rice-Davies and the Edgecombe shooting. He did not name Profumo, who was not in the House. Later in the debate Barbara Castle, the Labour MP for Blackburn, referred to the &quot;missing witness&quot; and hinted at a possible perversion of justice. The Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, refused to comment, adding that Wigg and Castle should &quot;seek other means of making these insinuations if they are prepared to substantiate them&quot;.

At the conclusion of the debate, the government&#x27;s law officers and Chief Whip agreed that Profumo should assert his innocence in a personal statement to the House. Such statements are, by long-standing tradition, made on the particular honour of the member and are accepted by the House without question. In the early hours of 22 March Profumo and his lawyers met with ministers and together agreed on an appropriate wording. Later that morning Profumo made his statement to a crowded House. He acknowledged friendships with Keeler and Ward, the former of whom, he said, he had last seen in December 1961. He had met &quot;a Mr Ivanov&quot; twice, also in 1961. He stated: &quot;There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler&quot;, and added: &quot;I shall not hesitate to issue writs for libel and slander if scandalous allegations are made or repeated outside the House.&quot; That afternoon, Profumo was photographed at Sandown Park Racecourse in the company of the Queen Mother.

While the matter was officially considered closed, many individual MPs had doubts, although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage. Wigg later said that he left the House that morning &quot;with black rage in my heart because I knew what the facts were. I knew the truth.&quot; Most newspapers were editorially non-committal; only &quot;The Guardian&quot;, under the headline &quot;Mr Profumo clears the air&quot;, stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value. Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re-emergence of Keeler in Madrid. She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused, adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent and that she had many friends in important positions. Keeler claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date. She was required to forfeit her recognizance of £40, but no other action was taken against her.

==Exposure==
===Investigation and resignation===
Shortly after Profumo&#x27;s Commons statement, Ward appeared on Independent Television News, where he endorsed Profumo&#x27;s version and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as &quot;baseless&quot;. Ward&#x27;s own activities had become a matter of official concern, and on 1 April 1963 the Metropolitan Police began to investigate his affairs. They interviewed 140 of Ward&#x27;s friends, associates and patients, maintained a 24-hour watch on his home, and tapped his telephone—this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke. Among those who gave statements was Keeler, who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her sexual relationship with Profumo, providing corroborative details of the interior of the Chester Terrace house. The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses; Rice-Davies was remanded to Holloway Prison for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward. Meanwhile, Profumo was awarded costs and £50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt. He donated the proceeds to an army charity.
This did not deter &quot;Private Eye&quot; from including &quot;Sextus Profano&quot; in their parody of Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.

On 18 April 1963 Keeler was attacked at the home of a friend. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and held. According to Knightley and Kennedy&#x27;s account, the police offered to drop the charges if Gordon would testify against Ward, but he refused. The effects of the police inquiry were proving ruinous to Ward, whose practice was collapsing rapidly. On 7 May he met Macmillan&#x27;s private secretary, Timothy Bligh, to ask that the police inquiry into his affairs be halted. He added that he had been covering for Profumo, whose Commons statement was substantially false. Bligh took notes but failed to take action. On 19 May Ward wrote to Brooke, with essentially the same request as that to Bligh, only to be told that the Home Secretary had no power to interfere with the police inquiry. Ward then gave details to the press, but no paper would print the story. He also wrote to Wilson, who showed the letter to Macmillan. Although privately disdainful of Wilson&#x27;s motives, after discussions with Hollis, the prime minister was sufficiently concerned about Ward&#x27;s general activities to ask the Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, to inquire into possible security breaches.

On 31 May 1963 at the start of the parliamentary Whitsun recess, Profumo and his wife flew to Venice for a short holiday. At their hotel, they received a message asking Profumo to return as soon as possible. Believing that his bluff had been called, Profumo then told his wife the truth, and they decided to return immediately. They found that Macmillan was on holiday in Scotland. On Tuesday 4 June, Profumo confessed the truth to Bligh, confirming that he had lied, resigned from the government, and applied for the office of steward of the Chiltern Hundreds in order to give up his House of Commons seat. Bligh informed Macmillan of these events by telephone. The resignation was announced on 5 June, when the formal exchange of letters between Profumo and Macmillan was published. &quot;The Times&quot; called Profumo&#x27;s lies &quot;a great tragedy for the probity of public life in Britain&quot;; while the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; hinted that not all the truth had been told and referred to &quot;skeletons in many cupboards&quot;.

===Retribution===
Gordon&#x27;s trial for the attack on Keeler began on the day Profumo&#x27;s resignation was made public. He maintained that his innocence would be established by two witnesses who, the police told the court, could not be found. On 7 June, principally on the evidence of Keeler, Gordon was found guilty and sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment. The following day, Ward was arrested and charged with immorality offences.

On 9 June, freed from Profumo&#x27;s libel threats, the &quot;News of the World&quot; published &quot;The Confessions of Christine&quot;, an account which helped to fashion the public image of Ward as a sexual predator and probable tool of the Soviets. The &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; (formerly the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;) printed Profumo&#x27;s &quot;Darling&quot; letter.

In advance of the House of Commons debate on Profumo&#x27;s resignation, due 17 June, David Watt in &quot;The Spectator&quot; defined Macmillan&#x27;s position as &quot;an intolerable dilemma from which he can only escape by being proved either ludicrously naïve or incompetent or deceitful—or all three&quot;. Meanwhile, the press speculated about possible Cabinet resignations, and several ministers felt it necessary to demonstrate their loyalty to the prime minister. In a BBC interview on 13 June Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone, holder of several ministerial offices, denounced Profumo in a manner which, according to &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;had to be seen to be believed&quot;. Hailsham said that &quot;a great party is not to be brought down because of a squalid affair between a woman of easy virtue and a proven liar&quot;.

In the debate, Wilson concentrated almost exclusively on the extent to which Macmillan and his colleagues had been dilatory in not identifying a clear security risk arising from Profumo&#x27;s association with Ward and his circle. Macmillan responded that he should not be held culpable for believing a colleague who had repeatedly asserted his innocence. He mentioned the false allegations against Galbraith, and the failure of the security services to share their detailed information with him. In the general debate the sexual aspects of the scandal were fully discussed; Nigel Birch, the Conservative MP for West Flintshire, referred to Keeler as a &quot;professional prostitute&quot; and asked rhetorically: &quot;What are whores about?&quot; Keeler was otherwise branded a &quot;tart&quot; and a &quot;poor little slut&quot;. Ward was vilified throughout as a likely Soviet agent; one Conservative referred to &quot;the treason of Dr Ward&quot;. Most Conservatives, whatever their reservations, were supportive of Macmillan, with only Birch suggesting that he should consider retirement. In the subsequent vote on the government&#x27;s handling of the affair, 27 Conservatives abstained, reducing the government&#x27;s majority to 69. Most newspapers considered the extent of the defection significant, and several forecast that Macmillan would soon resign.

After the parliamentary debate, newspapers published further sensational stories, hinting at widespread immorality within Britain&#x27;s governing class. A story emanating from Rice-Davies concerned a naked masked man, who acted as a waiter at sex parties; rumours suggested that he was a cabinet minister, or possibly a member of the Royal Family. Malcolm Muggeridge in the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; wrote of &quot;The Slow, Sure Death of the Upper Classes&quot;. On 21 June Macmillan instructed Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, to investigate and report on the growing range of rumours. Ward&#x27;s committal proceedings began a week later, at Marylebone magistrates&#x27; court, where the Crown&#x27;s evidence was fully reported in the press. Ward was committed for trial on charges of &quot;living off the earnings of prostitution&quot; and &quot;procuration of girl under twenty-one&quot;, and released on bail.

With the Ward case now &quot;sub judice&quot;, the press pursued related stories. &quot;The People&quot; reported that Scotland Yard had begun an inquiry, in parallel with Denning&#x27;s, into &quot;homosexual practices as well as sexual laxity&quot; among civil servants, military officers and MPs. On 24 June the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, under a banner heading &quot;Prince Philip and the Profumo Scandal&quot;, dismissed what it termed the &quot;foul rumour&quot; that the prince had been involved in the affair, without disclosing the nature of the rumour.

Ward&#x27;s trial began at the Old Bailey on 28 July. He was charged with living off the earnings of Keeler, Rice-Davies and two other prostitutes, and with procuring women under 21 to have sex with other persons. The thrust of the prosecution&#x27;s case related to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and turned on whether the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments they had given to Ward while living with him amounted to his living off their prostitution. Ward&#x27;s approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time. In his speeches and examination of witnesses, the prosecuting counsel Mervyn Griffith-Jones portrayed Ward as representing &quot;the very depths of lechery and depravity&quot;. The judge, Sir Archie Marshall, was equally hostile, drawing particular attention to the fact that none of Ward&#x27;s supposed society friends had been prepared to speak up for him. Towards the end of the trial, news came that Gordon&#x27;s conviction for assault had been overturned; Marshall did not disclose to the jury that Gordon&#x27;s witnesses had turned up and testified that Keeler, a key prosecution witness against Ward, had given false evidence at Gordon&#x27;s trial.

After listening to Marshall&#x27;s damning summing-up, on the evening of 30 July Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital. On the next day, he was found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; on the charges relating to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and acquitted on the other counts. Sentence was postponed until Ward was fit to appear, but on 3 August he died without regaining consciousness. On 9 August, a coroner&#x27;s jury ruled Ward&#x27;s death as suicide by barbiturate poisoning, though some biographers consider the possibility that he was murdered.

==Aftermath==
Lord Denning&#x27;s report was awaited with great anticipation by the public. Published on 26 September 1963, it concluded that there had been no security leaks in the Profumo affair and that the security services and government ministers had acted appropriately. Profumo had been guilty of an &quot;indiscretion&quot;, but no one could doubt his loyalty. Denning also found no evidence to link members of the government with associated scandals such as the &quot;man in the mask&quot;. He laid most of the blame for the affair on Ward, an &quot;utterly immoral&quot; man whose diplomatic activities were &quot;misconceived and misdirected&quot;. Although &quot;The Spectator&quot; considered that the report marked the end of the affair, many commentators were disappointed with its content. Young found many questions unanswered and some of the reasoning defective, while Davenport-Hines, writing long after the event, condemns the report as disgraceful, slipshod and prurient.

After the Denning Report, in defiance of general expectations that he would resign shortly, Macmillan announced his intention to stay on. On the eve of the Conservative Party&#x27;s annual conference in October 1963 he fell ill; his condition was less serious than he imagined and his life was not in danger but, convinced he had cancer, he resigned abruptly. Macmillan&#x27;s successor as prime minister was Lord Home, who renounced his peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In the October 1964 general election the Conservative Party was narrowly defeated, and Wilson became prime minister. A later commentator opined that the Profumo affair had destroyed the old, aristocratic Conservative Party: &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be too much to say that the Profumo scandal was the necessary prelude to the new Toryism, based on meritocracy, which would eventually emerge under Margaret Thatcher&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; suggested that the scandal had effected a fundamental and permanent change in relations between politicians and press. Davenport-Hines posits a longer-term consequence of the affair—the gradual ending of traditional notions of deference: &quot;Authority, however disinterested, well-qualified and experienced, was [after June 1963] increasingly greeted with suspicion rather than trust&quot;.
After expressing his &quot;deep remorse&quot; to the prime minister, to his constituents and to the Conservative Party, Profumo disappeared from public view. In April 1964 he began working as a volunteer at the Toynbee Hall settlement, a charitable organisation based in Spitalfields which supports the most deprived residents in the East End of London. Profumo continued his association with the settlement for the remainder of his life, at first in a menial capacity, then as administrator, fund-raiser, council member, chairman and finally president. Profumo&#x27;s charitable work was recognised when he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1975. He was later described by Thatcher as a national hero and was a guest at her 80th birthday celebrations in 2005. His marriage to Valerie Hobson lasted until her death on 13 November 1998, aged 81; Profumo died, aged 91, on 9 March 2006.

In December 1963 Keeler pleaded guilty to committing perjury at Gordon&#x27;s June trial, and she was sentenced to nine months&#x27; imprisonment, of which she served six months. After two brief marriages in 1965–66 to James Levermore and in 1971–72 to Anthony Platt that produced a child each, the elder of whom was largely raised by Keeler&#x27;s mother, Keeler largely lived alone from the mid-1990s until her death. Most of the considerable amount of money that she made from newspaper stories was dissipated by legal fees; during the 1970s, she said, &quot;I was not living, I was surviving&quot;. Keeler published several inconsistent accounts of her life, in which Ward has been variously represented as a &quot;gentleman&quot;, her truest love, a Soviet spy, and a traitor ranking alongside the Cambridge Five. Keeler also claimed that Profumo impregnated her and that she subsequently underwent a painful abortion. Keeler died on 4 December 2017, aged 75.

Rice-Davies enjoyed a more successful post-scandal career as a nightclub owner, businesswoman, minor actress and novelist. She was married three times, in what she described as her &quot;slow descent into respectability&quot;. Of adverse press publicity she observed: &quot;Like royalty, I simply do not complain&quot;. Rice-Davies died on 18 December 2014, aged 70.

Ward&#x27;s role on behalf of MI5 was confirmed in 1982, when &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; located his former contact &quot;Woods&quot;. Although Denning always asserted that Ward&#x27;s trial and conviction were fair and proper, most commentators believe that it was deeply flawed—an &quot;historical injustice&quot; according to Davenport-Hines, who argues that the trial was an act of political revenge. One High Court judge said privately that he would have stopped the trial before it reached the jury. The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has campaigned for the case to be reopened on several grounds, including the premature scheduling of the trial, lack of evidence to support the main charges, and various misdirections by the trial judge in his summing-up. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which has the power to investigate suspected miscarriages of justice, reviewed Ward&#x27;s case starting in early 2014, but in 2017 decided not to refer it to the Court of Appeal after failing to find the original transcript of the judge&#x27;s summing-up.

After his recall in January 1963, Ivanov disappeared for several decades. In 1992 his memoirs, &quot;The Naked Spy&quot;, were serialised in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. When this account was challenged by Profumo&#x27;s lawyers, the publishers removed the offending material. In August 2015 &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper published a preview of a forthcoming history of Soviet intelligence activities, by Jonathan Haslam. This book suggests that the relationship between Ivanov and Profumo was closer than the latter admitted, alleging that Ivanov visited Profumo&#x27;s home and that such was the slackness of security arrangements that he was able to photograph sensitive documents left lying about in the minister&#x27;s study.

Keeler describes a 1993 meeting with Ivanov in Moscow; she also records that he died the following year, aged 68. Astor was deeply upset at finding himself under police investigation, and by the social ostracism that followed the Ward trial. After his death in 1966, Cliveden House which had been gifted to the National Trust in 1942 became first the UK campus of Stanford University and later a luxury hotel. Rachman, who had first come to public notice as a sometime-boyfriend of both Keeler and Rice-Davies, was revealed as an unscrupulous slum landlord; the word &quot;Rachmanism&quot; entered English dictionaries as the standard term for landlords who exploit or intimidate their tenants.

==In popular culture==
There have been several dramatised versions of the Profumo affair. The 1989 film &quot;Scandal&quot; featured Ian McKellen as Profumo and John Hurt as Ward. It was favourably reviewed, but the revival of interest in the affair upset the Profumo family. The focus of Hugh Whitemore&#x27;s play &quot;A Letter of Resignation&quot;, first staged at the Comedy Theatre in October 1997, was Macmillan&#x27;s reactions to Profumo&#x27;s resignation letter, which he received while on holiday in Scotland. The pilot episode of the ITV series &quot;Endeavour&quot; makes reference to the scandal and uses similar elements in its plot. The BBC commissioned a 6-part drama &quot;The Trial of Christine Keeler&quot; from Ecosse Films which was broadcast in the UK at the end of 2019. Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Stephen Ward&quot; opened at London&#x27;s Aldwych Theatre on 3 December 2013. Among generally favourable reviews, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;″s critic recommended the production as &quot;sharp, funny – and, at times, genuinely touching&quot;. Robertson records that the script is &quot;remarkably faithful to the facts&quot;. In his song, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;, Billy Joel refers to the scandal with the line &quot;British politician sex&quot;. Scottish folk musician Al Stewart also refers to the scandal in his song &quot;Post World War II Blues&quot; on the album &quot;Past Present Future&quot;. On the television show &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Season 3, Episode 6 &quot;Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency&quot; which takes place in early July 1963, American office-manager Joan mentions the Prime Minister of England having a thing for prostitutes. She is corrected by Englishman John Hooker that it was the Secretary of State for War.

<text>Biffeche or Bifeche is an area of Senegal centred on the town of Savoigne, around 30 kilometres north-east of the major coastal city of Saint-Louis.

Low-lying and largely flat, the region is populated by Fula, Serer-Ndut, Wolof and Moor ethnic groups. The inhabitants&#x27; primary economic activities include animal herding and irrigation-based farming. Savoigne is the region&#x27;s largest town, twinned with La Ferté Macé; its SOCAS tomato-paste factory imports and dilutes tomato paste for re-shipment within Senegal. The population is primarily Muslim, but also contains Catholics and animists. The Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary is located to the north.

==History==
The Serer-Ndut were the earliest known inhabitants of Biffeche. Strong adherents to their native Serer religion, they were persecuted and killed by the Muslims communities of Senegal, and suffered further persecution under French colonial rule. 

Early European accounts described a medium-sized island (&quot;Isle de Bifeche&quot;) in the delta of the Senegal River, some two miles upstream from the island of N&#x27;Dar on which Saint-Louis was founded. &quot;The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge&quot; described the island in 1843 as being &quot;entirely covered with wood, and in the wet season a great portion of them is laid under water.&quot;

In the 17th century a chief known as the &quot;Petit Brak&quot; or &quot;Little King&quot; ruled over a region known variously as Biffeche or Gangueul with its capital at Maka. The &quot;Grand Brak&quot; or &quot;Big King&quot; ruled the kingdom of Waalo, whose capital was originally at Ndiourbel on the north bank of the river. The area was nearly depopulated by repeated slaving raids by Moors from the north. At times, the Petit Brak was tributary to Waalo, at other times allied with Bethio. In the 1720s, the Brak of Waalo was Erim M&#x27;Bagnick and Béquio Malicouri, king of the &quot;Royaume d&#x27;Oral&quot; (Bethio), was his vassal.

<text>The Principality of Bethio (also spelled Bequio, Bekio, Bitio, Bétio or Beetyo) was a small monarchy located for centuries along the lower Senegal River valley, on the border between modern Mauritania and Senegal, in the northeast of Biffeche. In the 18th century it was also called the &quot;Royaume d&#x27;Oral.&quot; Its capital was at Poum, then moved to N&#x27;Dombo, and finally moved to Ross, Senegal in the 19th century (called Ross Béthio since then). The original, fertile farmlands of Bethio are in a region just east of the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary.

In the 1720s, the Brak (king) of Waalo was Erim M&#x27;Bagnick (Yérim Mbañik) and Béquio Malicouri, king of the &quot;Royaume d&#x27;Oral&quot; was his vassal. Maalixuri (Malichouri) (Malikhuri Diop ) played a vital intermiediary role between the Kingdom of Waalo and the French at Saint-Louis, Senegal, accumulating power and influence. He attempted to secede from Waalo in 1724 and burned Rosso, but was defeated and driven into exile in Cayor, where he died. He was succeeded by Fara Coro.

Today, Abdoulaye Diop, the current Prince Bethio, lives at Ross-Bethio where he is a Senegalese political leader.

==Notes==

*The name also appears as Béco and appears synonymous with the &quot;Island of Becos&quot; in the river delta. It has been suggested that this is the island nowadays known as Baba Gueye.

<text>Hua Guofeng (born Su Zhu; 16 February 1921 – 20 August 2008) was a Chinese politician who served as chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and the 2nd premier of China. The designated successor of Mao Zedong, Hua held the top offices of the government, party, and the military after the deaths of Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, but was gradually forced out of supreme power by a coalition of party leaders between December 1978 and June 1981, and subsequently retreated from the political limelight, though still remaining a member of the Central Committee until 2002.

Born and raised in Jiaocheng, Hua joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1938, seeing action in both the Second Sino–Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War as a guerrilla fighter. In 1948, he was appointed party secretary of Xiangtan in Hunan, which included Mao&#x27;s birthplace of Shaoshan. A popular local administrator, Hua rose to become Hunan&#x27;s party secretary during the Cultural Revolution, and was elevated to the national stage in the early 1970s, notably assuming control of the Ministry of Public Security in 1973 and vice premier in 1975. After the death of Zhou Enlai in January 1976, Mao elevated Hua to the positions of premier and first vice chairman of the CCP, which made him Mao&#x27;s designated successor.

In October 1976, a month after Mao&#x27;s death, Hua arrested and removed the Gang of Four from power with the assistance of Mao&#x27;s security chief Wang Dongxing, who became one of Hua&#x27;s key supporters along with vice premier and chief economic planner Li Xiannian, and Luo Qingchang, head of the intelligence services. Hua also succeeded Mao as party chairman and chairman of the Central Military Commission, becoming the first to simultaneously hold the offices of party leader, premier, and commander-in-chief.

Hua reversed some of the Cultural Revolution–era policies, such as the constant ideological campaigns, but he was generally devoted to a command economy and the continuation of the Maoist line. Between December 1978 and June 1981, a group of party veterans led by Deng Xiaoping forced Hua from his position of paramount leader but allowed him to retain some titles. Hua gradually faded into political obscurity, but continued to insist on the correctness of Maoist principles.

==Early life==

Born in Jiaocheng, Shanxi, the fourth son of a family originally from Fan County, Henan, Hua lost his father at the age of seven. He studied at the Jiaocheng County Commercial School and joined the CCP in 1938, during the Second Sino–Japanese War. Like many Communists of the era who took on revolutionary names, he changed his name to Huá Guófēng as an abbreviation of &quot;&quot; (). After having served as a soldier in the 8th Route Army for 12 years under the command of Marshal Zhu De, he was appointed propaganda chief for the Jiaocheng County Party Committee in 1947, during the Chinese Civil War.

Hua moved with the victorious PLA to Hunan in 1948, where he married Han Zhijun, and would remain in that province until 1971. He was appointed Party Secretary for Xiangyin County in August 1949, just before the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in October of that year. In 1952, he was appointed secretary of Xiangtan Special District, which included Mao&#x27;s hometown, Shaoshan. In this role, he built a memorial hall dedicated to Mao. When Mao visited the site, in June 1959, he was favorably impressed. Mao Zedong first met Hua in 1955, and was impressed by his simplicity.

Because the Governor of Hunan, General Cheng Qian, was not a communist (he belonged to the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, a left-wing nationalist faction of the KMT that collaborated with the CCP), Hua gradually came to exercise more and more power within the province, being named Vice Governor in 1958.

Hua participated in the 1959 Lushan Conference (an enlarged plenary session of the CCP Central Committee) as a member of the Hunan Provincial Party delegation, and wrote two investigative reports fully defending all of Mao&#x27;s policies. Hua&#x27;s influence increased with the Cultural Revolution, as he supported it and led the movement in Hunan. He organized the preparation for the establishment of the local Revolutionary Committee in 1967, of which he was a deputy chairman. In December 1970, he was elected Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee as well as First Secretary of the CCP Hunan Committee.

He was elected a full member of the 9th Central Committee in 1969.

==At the center of power==

Hua was called to Beijing to direct Zhou Enlai&#x27;s State Council staff office in 1971, but only stayed for a few months before returning to his previous post in Hunan. Later that year, he was appointed as the most junior of the seven-member committee investigating the Lin Biao Affair, a sign of the strong trust Mao had in him. Hua was re-elected as a full member of the 10th Central Committee in 1973 and elevated to membership in the Politburo; in the same year, he was put in charge of agricultural development by Zhou Enlai.

In 1973, Mao named Hua Minister of Public Security and Vice Premier, thus giving him control of police and security forces. Hua&#x27;s rising influence was confirmed by his being chosen to deliver a speech on modernizing agriculture in October of that year, which echoed the views of Zhou Enlai.

Zhou Enlai died on 8 January 1976, at a time when Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reformist alliance was not yet strong enough to stand up to both the ailing Mao Zedong and his Cultural Revolution allies, the Gang of Four (Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Hongwen, and Yao Wenyuan). A week after reading the late premier&#x27;s eulogy, Deng left Beijing along with several close allies for the relative safety of Guangzhou.

Although Mao Zedong had reportedly wanted to appoint Zhang Chunqiao as Zhou Enlai&#x27;s successor, he ended up naming Hua as acting Premier, who was appointed without authorization from the National People&#x27;s Congress. At the same time, the media controlled by the Gang of Four began denouncing Deng once again (he had been purged during the Cultural Revolution, and was only returned to power in 1973). Popular affection for Zhou was underestimated, however, leading to the Tiananmen Incident, a confrontation between the radicals&#x27; militia allies and Beijing citizens seeking to honor Zhou during the traditional Qingming festival. At the same time, Hua delivered speeches on the &quot;official line for criticizing Deng Xiaoping&quot;, which were approved by Mao and the Party Central Committee.

During the Tiananmen Incident of 1976, thousands of people protested at the militia&#x27;s removal of wreaths honoring Zhou in front of the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes. Vehicles were burned, offices ransacked and there were reports of many injuries and deaths. In the aftermath, Deng Xiaoping was blamed for inciting the protests and stripped of all his party and government posts, though his party membership was retained at Mao&#x27;s behest. Shortly thereafter, Hua was elevated to First Vice Chairman of the CCP Central Committee and Premier of the State Council.

Following the 1976 Tangshan earthquake in July, Hua visited the devastated area and helped direct relief efforts there, while the Gang of Four was absent.

==Removing the Gang of Four==
Mao died on 9 September 1976 and Hua, as both the second highest-ranking member of the CCP and premier, led the national commemorations in Beijing in his honor in the days that followed, and was the keynote speaker during the national memorial observance in the capital&#x27;s Tiananmen Square. At the time, the highest power organ of the country, the Politburo Standing Committee, consisted of Hua, Marshal Ye Jianying, Zhang Chunqiao, and Wang Hongwen; Ye was in semi-retirement, and Zhang and Wang were part of the Gang of Four.

Hua knew that in the post-Mao power vacuum, his position vis-a-vis the Gang of Four&#x27;s would be a zero-sum game. That is, if the Gang of Four were not removed through use of force, the Gang might attempt to oust him pre-emptively. Hua made contact with Ye days after Mao&#x27;s death to discuss plans about the Gang of Four. Ye had grown disillusioned with the Gang before Mao&#x27;s death, so he and Hua came to a quick agreement to act against the Gang.

Hua crucially enjoyed the support of Mao&#x27;s loyal security chief, Wang Dongxing, who had command of the elite 8341 Special Regiment, as well as other leading figures on the Politburo, including Vice Premier Li Xiannian and General Chen Xilian, Commander of the Beijing Military Region, as well as Luo Qingchang, chief of the intelligence services. The group discussed ways to remove the Gang, including holding a Politburo or Central Committee meeting to oust them through established party procedure, but the idea was shot down because the Central Committee was, at the time, composed of many of the Gang&#x27;s supporters. Eventually, the group decided to use force.

The members of the Gang were arrested on 6 October, soon after midnight. Hua had summoned Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Hongwen, and Yao Wenyuan to a meeting at Zhongnanhai, ostensibly to discuss the fifth volume of Mao&#x27;s &quot;Selected Works&quot;. They were arrested while walking into the meeting at Huairen Hall. According to Hua&#x27;s own recollection of events, he and Marshal Ye Jianying were the only two leaders present at the &quot;meeting&quot;, awaiting the arrival of the members of the Gang. Upon the arrest of each of the three, Hua personally announced to them the reasons for their detention. Hua said that they had engaged in &quot;anti-party and anti-socialist&quot; acts and &quot;conspired to usurp power&quot;. Jiang Qing and Mao Yuanxin were arrested at their respective residences.

A task force led by Geng Biao occupied the headquarters of the party&#x27;s main propaganda organs, which were considered a part of the Gang&#x27;s turf at the time. Another group was dispatched to stabilize Shanghai, the Gang&#x27;s main regional power base. At an emergency Politburo meeting the next day, Hua Guofeng was appointed as chairman of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the governing body of People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). Hua&#x27;s accession to the top leadership was legitimized by a quote from Mao saying &quot;With you in charge, I am at ease&quot;, published afterwards of the purge of the Gang, used as an evidence of Mao&#x27;s &quot;boundless trust&quot; on Hua. The PLA had been critical to Hua&#x27;s appointment.

==Party Chairman and Premier==

During his relatively short period in power, from October 1976 to December 1978, Hua quickly ousted the Gang of Four from political power and thus became the leader whose emergence marked the end of the Cultural Revolution. Following the incarceration of the Gang of Four and the establishment of the new ruling triumvirate (Hua Guofeng, Marshal Ye Jianying, and chief economic planner Li Xiannian) began the restoration to power of Deng Xiaoping and the elimination of Gang influence throughout the political system, leading to a power struggle between Hua and Deng. This struggle was decisively resolved in Deng&#x27;s favor in December 1978, which is generally taken as the start of the era of Chinese economic reform.

=== Domestic politics ===
Hua was not broadly known to the Chinese public at the time of his appointment.

Starting in late 1976, Hua started a nationwide campaign to criticize the Gang of Four, together with a process of &quot;reversing the verdicts&quot; for people who criticized the Gang. People punished after the 1976 Tiananmen incident were released, and the incident was re-assessed during a Central Work Conference held in 1977. From October 1976 to December 1978, more than 4600 cadres disgraced during the Cultural Revolution were rehabilitated.

In July 1977, at the 1st Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Deng was rehabilitated with the approval of Hua. The Plenum also marked a large change in the Central Committee&#x27;s composition, with 68 newly elected members, of which more than 20 were rehabilitated officials. Despite his wishes to be cremated, Mao&#x27;s body was also placed in a mausoleum, while Hua was in charge of editing the fifth volume of &quot;Selected Works of Mao Zedong&quot;, later subject to significant propaganda efforts.

In February 1977, the central leadership under Hua released a new slogan: &quot;We will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave&quot;. Satirically referred to as the &quot;Two Whatevers&quot;, this slogan was used to criticize Hua due to the perception that he obeyed Mao&#x27;s orders too blindly. The leadership authorized the first National College Entrance Examination since the Cultural Revolution began in 1977.

Hua also attempted reforming state protocol as a method of elevating his prestige. In 1978 all party meetings were to hang portraits of Mao and Hua side-by-side, including at the National People&#x27;s Congress and CCP Party Congress meetings. All schools were required to hang Hua&#x27;s picture next to Mao&#x27;s. Hua also changed the Chinese national anthem to incorporate Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, switching the tone from being war-rallying to purely Communist ideology; these lyrics were eventually rejected. Hua Guofeng continued to use the terminology of the Cultural Revolution, but he criticized certain aspects of it, including the education reform, the revolutionary committees&#x27; activity and other excesses, blaming the Gang of Four. State media referred to him as &quot;the wise leader&quot;.

In February 1978, the first session of the 5th National People&#x27;s Congress approved a new state constitution, which Hua was heavily involved in drafting. This document attempted to restore some rule of law and planning mechanisms from the PRC&#x27;s original 1956 constitution, though it still contained references to continuous revolution and proletarian internationalism; it was replaced only four years later with a different constitution.

=== Economy ===
During his tenure, Hua was concerned at the state of China&#x27;s economy, stating that he feared it was on the brink of collapse. Hua worked with Li Xiannian to boost the economy, endorsing a plan to accelerate economic growth by boosting enterprises budgets and importing massive amounts of foreign technology. He introduced an ambitious ten-year economic plan which sought to create a Soviet-style economy by increasing investments in heavy industry and energy, mechanizing agriculture and using imported technology to build new manufacturing plants. Starting from 1977, Hua also spoke about the &quot;Four Modernizations&quot;. Though the idea of importing technology was not new, Hua&#x27;s approach was differentiated by its scale, with planned imports of $80 billion by the summer of 1978.

His proposal to purchase foreign equipment, services, and infrastructure through massive loans, which were viewed as reckless, impractical, and later derided as &quot;the Western-Led Leap Forward&quot;. Although his industrial proposals proved unrealistic, Hua&#x27;s efforts removed the political stigma from the idea of importing technology. The technology import plans were quickly scrapped in favor of a cheaper and more doable five-year plan which prioritized light industry and consumer goods. Hua&#x27;s economic and political programs involved the restoration of Soviet-style industrial planning and party control similar to that followed by China before the Great Leap Forward. However, this model was rejected by supporters of Deng Xiaoping, who argued for a more private-based economic system.

=== Foreign policy ===
In 1978, Hua visited Yugoslavia and Romania to study their socialist economic experiences and advanced production techniques.

In October 1979, Hua went on a European tour, the first of its kind for a Chinese leader after 1949. He traveled to West Germany and France. On 28 October Hua visited the United Kingdom and met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The two engaged in friendly talks and discussed the future of Hong Kong, which was a British Overseas Territory at the time. Chairman Hua visited Derby&#x27;s British Rail Railway Technical Centre to observe the development of the Advanced Passenger Train. His visit coincided with the donation of the Chinese Government Railways Steam Locomotive 4-8-4 KF Class No 7 to the National Railway Museum in York. Chairman Hua also went to a farm in Oxfordshire and visited Oxford University.
Hua was one of the last foreigners to visit Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, before he was overthrown in 1979.

==Power struggle and ousting==
Though Deng consistently supported Hua&#x27;s policies, he later started to subtly criticize Hua, aiming to increase his own power. He was supported by Hu Yaobang, head of the CCP Organization Department starting from 1977, who criticized Hua as too dogmatic and contrasted him with Deng. This eventually led to the major editorial titled &quot;Practice Is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth&quot;, drafted by philosopher Hu Fuming and published in May 1978, which argued that significant errors were committed in CCP history because there was insufficient focus on &quot;testing truth&quot; through &quot;practice&quot;. Though criticized by some Party members, the article was soon endorsed by Deng.

On 10 November, the Central Work Conference was held, in which Hua attempted to move away from the CCP&#x27;s emphasis on class struggle towards economic and technological development. Though succeeding, he was reprimanded by elderly CCP members for not focusing enough on reckoning with the Cultural Revolution as well as the 1976 Tiananmen incident. Hua, encouraged by Ye Jianying and Party elders Chen Yun to accept the demands, gave a speech at the conference on 25 November, where he stated that the Tiananmen incident was an &quot;entirely a revolutionary mass movement, and it is necessary to reevaluate it openly and thoroughly.&quot; Significantly boosting Deng, this led to posthumous rehabilitations as well as reinstating of leaders including Bo Yibo and Yang Shangkun. Many elderly Party members talked about their suffering during the Cultural Revolution, criticizing Hua for not clearly breaking with Maoism. Hua gave self-criticism on 13 September for siding too closely with Mao&#x27;s positions.

Hua effectively lost power at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, after which Deng Xiaoping became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of China with his idea for economic reform being adopted by the Party. He continued to hold some power, notably blocking additions critical of him to the &quot;Historical Resolution&quot; drafted by the CCP leadership to evaluate the Cultural Revolution. He was replaced as Premier by Zhao Ziyang in September 1980, while the Politburo issued a formal criticism of Hua in December, casting him as a figure that opposed modernization and sought simply to parrot Mao. This was further reinforced by the Historical Resolution adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee on 27 June 1981, which said that Hua did too little to change things after Mao&#x27;s death. It also stated that he had done good work by removing the Gang of Four, but afterwards, he committed &quot;serious errors&quot;.

As Deng gradually gained control of the CCP, Hua was denounced for promoting the Two Whatevers policy. As early as January 1979, state media had stopped referring to him as &quot;the wise leader&quot; and he was replaced as Premier by Zhao Ziyang in September 1980, was replaced as Party Chairman by Hu Yaobang and was replaced as chairman of the Central Military Commission by Deng himself in 1981. Hua Guofeng was demoted to the position of junior Vice Chairman; and when this post was abolished in 1982, he continued to serve as an ordinary member of the Central Committee, a position which he held until the 16th Party Congress of November 2002, despite having passed the unofficial mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1991.
== Retirement and death ==
After 16th Party Congress in November 2002, Hua officially lost his seat on the Central Committee of the CCP. It was reported that he voluntarily retired for age and health reasons, but the party did not officially confirm this. He was, however, invited to the 17th Party Congress in 2007 as a special delegate and he appeared at a ceremony which was held in December 2007 in order to commemorate the 115th anniversary of Mao Zedong&#x27;s birth. Despite his retention of formal party positions, Hua distanced himself from active participation in politics. His main hobby was grape cultivation, and he kept up with current affairs by subscribing to a host of newspapers.

Hua&#x27;s health deteriorated in 2008, and he was hospitalized for kidney and heart complications. Hua died in Beijing on 20 August 2008. A cause of death was not given, and because his death occurred during the 2008 Summer Olympics, it was not given much attention by state media: merely a 30-second broadcast on the national news program &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot; and a short paragraph on the corner of the front page of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;. His funeral, which was held at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery on 30 August, was attended by the all members of the Politburo Standing Committee, as well as former President Jiang Zemin and former Premier Zhu Rongji.

== Legacy ==
Hua&#x27;s legacy is often reduced to the Two Whatevers: &quot;uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave.&quot;

Economic historian Isabella Weber argues that the Hua&#x27;s upholding of the Two Whatevers policy is an overemphasized aspect of Hua&#x27;s legacy. Weber argues that &quot;Paying tribute to Mao in the year after his passing was hardly unique to Hua&quot; and that the Two Whatevers slogan was also upheld by Chen Yun, who along with Deng Xiaoping superseded Hua.

Hua&#x27;s break with Cultural Revolution era economic policies were consistent with the 1975 reform agenda of Deng. Hua made national economic development a matter of the highest priority and emphasized the need to achieve &quot;liberation of productive forces&quot;. He &quot;combined Soviet-style big push industrialization with an opening up to the capitalist world&quot; and under his leadership, China opened its first Special Economic Zone and launched major efforts to attract foreign direct investment. Hua&#x27;s encouraged a local economy policy that included both planned elements and limited market freedom of the sort that Mao had previously derided as economism. Additionally, Hua also encouraged free debates within the CCP, which aimed to promote a more reformist form of Maoism. His political and economic reforms contributed to the early de facto de-Maoization in China, therefore paved the way for Chinese economic reform led by Deng.

Hua removed the controls that the Gang of Four had established over cultural and educational policy. The relaxation of controls over cultural content resulted in a transition from revolutionary art to more market-oriented and individualist works like scar literature. Hua regained the loyalty of party cadre and intellectuals, who had generally been marginalized during the Cultural Revolution. This strengthened the party apparatus and contributed to national stability.

The ousting of Hua was significant in at least two respects. First, it demonstrated the unimportance of official titles in the Chinese Communist Party during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite being the official leader of the party, the state, and the army, Hua was unable to defeat a leadership challenge by Deng Xiaoping. Secondly, Hua&#x27;s ousting reflected a change of policies which were initiated by Deng Xiaoping according to which disgraced party members would merely be stripped of their positions, they would not be jailed or physically harmed.

==Family==
Hua married Han Zhijun in January 1949. They had four children, all of whom are surnamed &quot;Su&quot; (), in accordance with Hua&#x27;s birth name. Their first son, Su Hua, is a retired Air Force officer. Their second son, Su Bin, is a retired army officer. Their older daughter, Su Ling, is a party and union official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Their younger daughter, Su Li, works for the State Council.

<text>Irish round towers ( (singular), (plural); literally &#x27;bell house&#x27;) are early medieval stone towers of a type found mainly in Ireland, with two in Scotland and one on the Isle of Man. As their name indicates, they were originally bell towers, though they may have been later used for additional purposes.

A tower of this kind is generally found in the vicinity of a church or monastery, with the door of the tower facing the west doorway of the church. Knowledge of this fact has made it possible, where towers still exist, to determine without excavation the approximate sites of lost churches that once stood nearby.

==Construction and distribution==
Surviving towers range in height from to , and to in circumference; that at Kilmacduagh being the highest surviving in Ireland (and leaning out of perpendicular). The masonry differs according to date, the earliest examples being uncut rubble, while the later ones are of neatly joined stonework (ashlar). The lower portion is solid masonry with a single door raised two to three metres above, often accessible only by a ladder. Within, in some, are two or more floors (or signs of where such floors existed), usually of wood, and it is thought that there were ladders in between. The windows, which are high up, are slits in the stone. The cap (roof), is of stone, usually conical in shape, although some of the towers are now crowned by a later circle of battlements.

The main reason for the entrance-way being built above ground level was to maintain the structural integrity of the building rather than for defence. The towers were generally built with very little foundation. The tower at Monasterboice has an underground foundation of only sixty centimetres. Building the door at ground level would weaken the tower. The buildings still stand today because their round shape is gale-resistant and the section of the tower underneath the entrance is packed with soil and stones.

The distance from the ground to the raised doorway is somewhat greater than that from the first floor to the second; thus large, rigid steps would be too large for the door. Excavations in the 1990s, revealing postholes, confirm that wooden steps were built. However, the use of ladders prior to the construction of such steps 
cannot be ruled out.
The towers were probably built between the 9th and 12th centuries. In Ireland about 120 examples are thought once to have existed; most are in ruins, while eighteen to twenty are almost perfect. There are three examples outside Ireland. Two are in eastern Scotland: the Brechin Round Tower and the Abernethy Round Tower, and the other is in Peel Castle on St. Patrick&#x27;s Isle, now linked to the Isle of Man.

Famous examples are to be found at Devenish Island, and Glendalough, while that at Clondalkin is the only round tower in Ireland to still retain its original cap. With five towers each, County Mayo, County Kilkenny and County Kildare have the most. Mayo&#x27;s round towers are at Aughagower, Balla, Killala, Meelick and Turlough, while Kildare&#x27;s are located at Kildare Cathedral (which is high), and also at Castledermot, Oughter Ard, Taghadoe (near Maynooth) and Old Kilcullen. The only known round tower with a hexagonal base is at Kinneigh in County Cork, built in 1014. The round tower at Ardmore, County Waterford, believed to be the latest built in Ireland (c. 12th century), has the unique feature of three string courses around the exterior.

==Purpose==
It is likely that the primary reason for the round tower was—as the name &quot;cloigtheach&quot; indicates—to act as a belfry. The Irish word for round tower, &quot;cloigtheach&quot;, literally meaning &quot;bellhouse&quot; indicates this, as noted by George Petrie in 1845. The Irish language has greatly evolved over the last millennium. Dinneen notes the alternate pronunciations, &quot;cluiceach&quot; and &quot;cuilceach&quot; for &quot;cloigtheach&quot;. The closely pronounced &quot;cloichtheach&quot; means stone-house or stone-building. The round tower seems to be the only significant stone building in Ireland before the advent of the Normans in 1169–1171 CE.

UCD Professor of Archaeology Tadhg O&#x27;Keeffe has suggested that the towers were originally high-status royal chapels, citing how two of them (Kells and Duleek) were scenes of regicide. He also suggested that the windows were arranged clockwise to imitate the order of relic-carrying procession from the elevated door to the very top.

Another possible purpose would be for taking shelter during raids. The mostly enclosed top floors and stone rooftops would make for terrible belltowers. The elevated doorway could have had a ladder that would be drawn up during raids, and the thick stone walls could withstand most attacks. Since the doors always face where a church stood, this also adds weight to the theory they were where monks would evacuate to. The oldest reference to a round tower (the one at Slane, see below) records its use as a refuge – however in this case it was burnt by the Vikings, killing everyone inside.

==Modern symbolic towers==
===In Ireland===
Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s tomb at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin had a round tower built above it after his burial in 1847.

At what is now the Irish National Heritage Park at Ferrycarrig in County Wexford, there is a 19th-century copy of a round tower. It was erected to the memory of the Wexford men who fell in the Crimean War.

Adjacent to St. Mary&#x27;s church, Ballygibbon, County Cork, the Waterloo Round Tower is an architectural folly bell tower that was built in the 1840s to resemble a mediaeval round tower.

At St. Ita&#x27;s Hospital in Portrane, County Dublin, there is a replica round tower built in 1844 as a memorial to George Hampden Evans by his wife.

In the Knockmealdown Mountains in County Waterford is another memorial in the form of an 18m high round tower. It was erected in 1935 on the spot where Liam Lynch, military leader of the anti-treaty Irish Republican Army during the Irish Civil War is thought to have fallen in 1923.

The Ulster History Park in County Tyrone has a replica of a round tower.

St Patrick&#x27;s Church of Ireland church in Saul, County Down has a round tower, built in 1933.

The Chaine Memorial Tower in Larne County Antrim is a lighthouse done in the style of a round tower. It was built to commemorate James Chaine, a former MP for Antrim.

===Outside Ireland===

Another &quot;revival&quot; round tower was built in 1997 in the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Belgium, as a war memorial to the soldiers of the island of Ireland who died, were wounded or are missing from World War I. The tower is in the traditional design of an Irish round tower and is partially built with stone from a former army barracks in Tipperary.

At Saint Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Milford, Massachusetts a round tower was built of Milford granite in the late 19th century as a memorial to central Massachusetts&#x27; Irish immigrants, of whom thousands are buried there.
In 2003 Tony Ryan, a native of Thurles, County Tipperary, built a round tower at his Castleton Lyons Stud in Kentucky.

The second church to be built on the site of St John the Evangelist Catholic Church in East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, completed in December 1900, features a 13-metre Irish round tower on its eastern side. The tower is based on the entrance to King Cormac&#x27;s Chapel on the Rock of Cashel in Tipperary, built in 1137. The structure is now part of the Catholic Leadership Centre, operated by the Catholic Education Office Melbourne.

<doc id="100439" wikidata="Q245097" url="?curid=100439" title="Wingspan">
<text>The wingspan (or just span) of a bird or an airplane is the distance from one wingtip to the opposite wingtip. For example, the Boeing 777–200 has a wingspan of , and a wandering albatross (&quot;Diomedea exulans&quot;) caught in 1965 had a wingspan of , the official record for a living bird.
The term wingspan, more technically extent, is also used for other winged animals such as pterosaurs, bats, insects, etc., and other aircraft such as ornithopters.
In humans, the term wingspan also refers to the arm span, which is the distance between the length from the end of an individual&#x27;s arm (measured at the fingertips) to the individual&#x27;s fingertips on the other arm when raised parallel to the ground at shoulder height.

==Wingspan of aircraft==
The wingspan of an aircraft is always measured in a straight line, from wingtip to wingtip, regardless of wing shape or sweep.

===Implications for aircraft design and animal evolution===
The lift from wings is proportional to their area, so the heavier the animal or aircraft the bigger that area must be. The area is the product of the span times the width (mean chord) of the wing, so either a long, narrow wing or a shorter, broader wing will support the same mass. For efficient steady flight, the ratio of span to chord, the aspect ratio, should be as high as possible (the constraints are usually structural) because this lowers the lift-induced drag associated with the inevitable wingtip vortices. Long-ranging birds, like albatrosses, and most commercial aircraft maximize aspect ratio. Alternatively, animals and aircraft which depend on maneuverability (fighters, predators and prey, as well as those who live amongst trees and bushes, insect catchers, etc.) need to be able to roll fast to turn, and the high moment of inertia of long narrow wings, as well as the high angular drag and quick balancing of aileron lift with wing lift at a low rotation rate, produce lower roll rates. For them, short-span, broad wings are preferred. Additionally, ground handling in aircraft is a significant problem for very high aspect ratios and flying animals may encounter similar issues.

The highest aspect ratio of man-made wings are aircraft propellers, in their most extreme form as helicopter rotors.
==Wingspan of flying animals==

To measure the wingspan of a bird, a live or freshly-dead specimen is placed flat on its back, the wings are grasped at the wrist joints and the distance is measured between the tips of the longest primary feathers on each wing.

The wingspan of an insect refers to the wingspan of pinned specimens, and may refer to the distance between the centre of the thorax and the apex of the wing doubled or to the width between the apices with the wings set with the trailing wing edge perpendicular to the body.

==Wingspan in sports==
In basketball and gridiron football, a fingertip-to-fingertip measurement is used to determine the player&#x27;s wingspan, also called armspan. This is called reach in boxing terminology. The wingspan of 16-year-old BeeJay Anya, a top basketball Junior Class of 2013 prospect who played for the NC State Wolfpack, was officially measured at across, one of the longest of all National Basketball Association draft prospects, and the longest ever for a non-7-foot player, though Anya went undrafted in 2017. The wingspan of Manute Bol, at , is (as of 2013) the longest in NBA history, and his vertical reach was .

<text>The Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1138 and 1153, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a war of succession precipitated by the accidental death of William Adelin (the only legitimate son of Henry I) who had drowned in the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster of 1120. Henry sought to be succeeded by his daughter, known as Empress Matilda, but was only partially successful in convincing the nobility to support her. On Henry&#x27;s death in 1135, his nephew Stephen of Blois seized the throne, with the help of Stephen&#x27;s brother Henry of Blois, who was the bishop of Winchester. Stephen&#x27;s early reign saw fierce fighting with disloyal English barons, rebellious Welsh leaders, and Scottish invaders. Following a major rebellion in the south-west of England, Matilda invaded in 1139 with the help of her half-brother Robert of Gloucester.

In the initial years of civil war, neither side was able to achieve a decisive advantage; the Empress came to control the south-west of England and much of the Thames Valley, while Stephen remained in control of the south-east. Much of the rest of the country was held by barons who refused to support either side. The castles of the period were easily defensible, so the fighting was mostly attrition warfare comprising sieges, raiding and skirmishing. Armies mostly consisted of armoured knights and footsoldiers, many of them mercenaries. In 1141, Stephen was captured following the Battle of Lincoln, causing a collapse in his authority over most of the country. When Empress Matilda attempted to be crowned queen, she was forced instead to retreat from London by hostile crowds; shortly afterwards, Robert of Gloucester was captured at the rout of Winchester. The two sides agreed to a prisoner exchange, swapping the captives Stephen and Robert. Stephen then almost captured Matilda in 1142 during the Siege of Oxford, but the Empress escaped from Oxford Castle across the frozen River Thames to safety.

The war continued for another eleven years. Empress Matilda&#x27;s husband, Count Geoffrey V of Anjou, conquered Normandy in her name during 1143, but in England neither side could achieve victory. Rebel barons began to acquire ever greater power in Northern England and in East Anglia, with widespread devastation in the regions of major fighting. In 1148, the Empress returned to Normandy, leaving the campaigning in England to her eldest son Henry Fitzempress. In 1152, Stephen attempted to have his eldest son, Eustace of Boulogne, recognised by the Church as the next king of England, but the Church refused to do so. By the early 1150s, most barons and the Church were war weary, so favoured negotiating a long-term peace.

Henry Fitzempress re-invaded England in 1153, but neither faction&#x27;s forces were keen to fight. After limited campaigning, the two armies faced each other at the siege of Wallingford, but the Church brokered a truce, thereby preventing a pitched battle. Stephen and Henry began peace negotiations, during which Eustace died of illness, removing Stephen&#x27;s immediate heir. The resulting Treaty of Wallingford allowed Stephen to retain the throne but recognised Henry as his successor. Over the following year, Stephen began to reassert his authority over the whole kingdom, but died of disease in 1154. Henry was crowned as Henry II, the first Angevin king of England, then began a long period of reconstruction.

The conflict was considered particularly destructive, even by the standards of medieval warfare. One chronicler stated that &quot;Christ and his saints were asleep&quot; during the period. Victorian historians coined the term &quot;the Anarchy&quot; because of the widespread chaos, although modern historians have questioned its accuracy and some contemporary accounts.
==Origins of the conflict==
===&quot;White Ship&quot;===
The origins of the Anarchy lay in a succession crisis involving England and Normandy. In the 11th and 12th centuries, north-west France was controlled by a number of dukes and counts, frequently in conflict with one another for valuable territory. In 1066 one of these men, Duke William II of Normandy, mounted an invasion to conquer the rich Anglo-Saxon kingdom of England, pushing on into south Wales and northern England in the ensuing years. The division and control of these lands after William&#x27;s death proved problematic and his children fought multiple wars over the spoils. William&#x27;s son Henry I seized power after the death of his elder brother William Rufus and subsequently invaded and captured the Duchy of Normandy, controlled by his eldest brother Robert Curthose, defeating Robert&#x27;s army at the Battle of Tinchebray. Henry intended for his lands to be inherited by his only legitimate son, seventeen-year-old William Adelin.

In 1120, the political landscape changed dramatically when the &quot;White Ship&quot; sank en route from Barfleur in Normandy to England; around three hundred passengers died, including Adelin. With Adelin dead, the inheritance to the English throne was thrown into doubt. Rules of succession in western Europe at the time were uncertain; in some parts of France, male primogeniture, in which the eldest son would inherit all titles, was becoming more popular. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands – usually considered to be the most valuable – and younger sons being given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years: there had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.

With William Adelin dead, Henry had only one other legitimate child, Matilda, but female rights of inheritance were unclear during this period. Despite Henry taking a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, it became increasingly unlikely that Henry would have another legitimate son and instead he looked to Matilda as his intended heir. Matilda had been married to Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, from which she later claimed the title of empress. Her husband died in 1125 and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey V of Anjou, whose county bordered the Duchy of Normandy. Geoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry&#x27;s domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed by the power of the king&#x27;s personality and reputation.

Henry attempted to build up a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful ruler after her. Stephen was among those who took this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda and Geoffrey became increasingly strained towards the end of the king&#x27;s life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the king should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda while he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry&#x27;s death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Foret.

===Succession===

After Henry&#x27;s death, the English throne was taken not by his daughter Matilda, but by Stephen of Blois, ultimately resulting in civil war. Stephen was the son of Stephen-Henry of Blois, one of the powerful counts of northern France, and Adela of Normandy, daughter of William the Conqueror. Stephen and Matilda were thus first cousins. His parents allied themselves with Henry, and Stephen, as a younger son without lands of his own, became Henry&#x27;s client, travelling as part of his court and serving in his campaigns. In return he received lands and was married to Matilda of Boulogne in 1125, the daughter and only heiress of the Count of Boulogne, who owned the important continental port of Boulogne and vast estates in the north-west and south-east of England. By 1135, Stephen was a well established figure in Anglo-Norman society, while his younger brother Henry had also risen to prominence, becoming the Bishop of Winchester and the second-richest man in England after the king. Henry of Winchester was keen to reverse what he perceived as encroachment by the Norman kings on the rights of the church.

When news began to spread of Henry I&#x27;s death, many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda&#x27;s supporters such as Robert of Gloucester. Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Nonetheless, Geoffrey and Matilda took the opportunity to march into southern Normandy and seize a number of key castles; there they stopped, unable to advance further. Stephen&#x27;s elder brother Theobald, who had succeeded his father as count, was further south still, in Blois.

Stephen was conveniently placed in Boulogne, and when news reached him of Henry&#x27;s death he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen probably reached his own estate on the edge of London by 8 December and over the next week he began to seize power in England.

The crowds in London traditionally claimed a right to elect the king of England, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return. Henry of Blois delivered the support of the church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, who was both the Bishop of Salisbury and the Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen. On 15 December, Henry delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late king had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath. Furthermore, the late king had only insisted on that oath to protect the stability of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late king&#x27;s royal steward, to swear that the king had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen&#x27;s coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 26 December.

Meanwhile, the Norman nobility gathered at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring Theobald king, probably following the news that Stephen was gathering support in England. The Normans argued that the count, as the more senior grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the duchy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda. Theobald met with the Norman barons and Robert of Gloucester at Lisieux on 21 December but their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen&#x27;s coronation was to occur the next day. Theobald then agreed to the Normans&#x27; proposal that he be made king, only to find that his former support immediately ebbed away: the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen. Stephen subsequently financially compensated Theobald, who in return remained in Blois and supported his brother&#x27;s succession.

==Road to war==
===New regime (1135–1138)===
Stephen had to intervene in the north of England immediately after his coronation. David I of Scotland, brother of Henry I&#x27;s first queen and maternal uncle of Matilda, invaded the north on the news of Henry&#x27;s death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Northern England was a disputed territory at this time, with the Scottish kings laying a traditional claim to Cumberland, and David also claiming Northumbria by virtue of his marriage to the daughter of the former Anglo-Saxon earl Waltheof. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham. An agreement was made under which David would return most of the territory he had taken, with the exception of Carlisle. In return, Stephen confirmed David&#x27;s son Prince Henry&#x27;s possessions in England, including the Earldom of Huntingdon.

Returning south, Stephen held his first royal court at Easter 1136. A wide range of nobles gathered at Westminster for the event, including many of the Anglo-Norman barons and most of the higher officials of the church. Stephen issued a new royal charter, confirming the promises he had made to the church, promising to reverse Henry&#x27;s policies on the royal forests and to reform any abuses of the royal legal system. Stephen portrayed himself as the natural successor to Henry I&#x27;s policies, and reconfirmed the existing seven earldoms in the kingdom on their existing holders. The Easter court was a lavish event, and a large amount of money was spent on the event itself, clothes and gifts. Stephen gave out grants of land and favours to those present, and endowed numerous church foundations with land and privileges. Stephen&#x27;s accession to the throne still needed to be ratified by the Pope, and Henry of Blois appears to have been responsible for ensuring that testimonials of support were sent from Stephen&#x27;s elder brother Theobald and from the French king Louis VI, to whom Stephen represented a useful balance to Angevin power in the north of France. Pope Innocent II confirmed Stephen as king by letter later that year, and Stephen&#x27;s advisers circulated copies widely around England to demonstrate Stephen&#x27;s legitimacy.
Troubles continued across Stephen&#x27;s new kingdom. After the Welsh victory at the Battle of Llwchwr in January 1136 and the successful ambush of Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare in April, south Wales rose in rebellion, starting in east Glamorgan and rapidly spreading across the rest of south Wales during 1137. Owain Gwynedd and Gruffydd ap Rhys captured considerable territories, including Carmarthen Castle. Stephen responded by sending Richard&#x27;s brother Baldwin and the Marcher Lord Robert Fitz Harold of Ewyas into Wales to pacify the region. Neither mission was particularly successful and by the end of 1137 the king appears to have abandoned attempts to put down the rebellion. Historian David Crouch suggests that Stephen effectively &quot;bowed out of Wales&quot; around this time to concentrate on his other problems. Meanwhile, Stephen had put down two revolts in the south-west led by Baldwin de Redvers and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became an increasingly vocal critic of the king.

Geoffrey of Anjou attacked Normandy in early 1136 and, after a temporary truce, invaded later the same year, raiding and burning estates rather than trying to hold the territory. Events in England meant that Stephen was unable to travel to Normandy himself, so Waleran de Beaumont, appointed by Stephen as the lieutenant of Normandy, and Theobald led the efforts to defend the duchy. Stephen himself only returned to the duchy in 1137, where he met with Louis VI and Theobald to agree to an informal regional alliance, probably brokered by Henry, to counter the growing Angevin power in the region. As part of this deal, Louis recognised Stephen&#x27;s son Eustace as Duke of Normandy in exchange for Eustace giving fealty to the French king. Stephen was less successful in regaining the Argentan province along the Normandy and Anjou border, which Geoffrey had taken at the end of 1135. Stephen formed an army to retake it, but the frictions between his Flemish mercenary forces led by William of Ypres and the local Norman barons resulted in a battle between the two halves of his army. The Norman forces then deserted the king, forcing Stephen to give up his campaign. Stephen agreed to another truce with Geoffrey, promising to pay him 2,000 marks a year in exchange for peace along the Norman borders.

Stephen&#x27;s first years as king can be interpreted in different ways. Seen positively, Stephen stabilised the northern border with Scotland, contained Geoffrey&#x27;s attacks on Normandy, was at peace with Louis VI, enjoyed good relations with the church and had the broad support of his barons. There were significant underlying problems, nonetheless. The north of England was now controlled by David and Prince Henry, Stephen had abandoned Wales, the fighting in Normandy had considerably destabilised the duchy, and an increasing number of barons felt that Stephen had given them neither the lands nor the titles they felt they deserved or were owed. Stephen was also rapidly running out of money: Henry&#x27;s considerable treasury had been emptied by 1138 due to the costs of running Stephen&#x27;s more lavish court, and the need to raise and maintain his mercenary armies fighting in England and Normandy.

===Early fighting (1138–1139)===
Fighting broke out on several fronts during 1138. Firstly, Robert of Gloucester rebelled against the king, starting the descent into civil war in England. An illegitimate son of Henry I and the half-brother of the Empress Matilda, Robert was one of the most powerful Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the Earldom of Gloucester. In 1138, Robert renounced his fealty to Stephen and declared his support for Matilda, triggering a major regional rebellion in Kent and across the south-west of England, although Robert himself remained in Normandy. Matilda had not been particularly active in asserting her claims to the throne since 1135 and in many ways it was Robert that took the initiative in declaring war in 1138. In France, Geoffrey took advantage of the situation by re-invading Normandy. David of Scotland also invaded the north of England once again, announcing that he was supporting the claim of his niece the Empress Matilda to the throne, pushing south into Yorkshire.

Stephen rapidly responded to the revolts and invasions, focusing primarily on England rather than Normandy. His wife Matilda was sent to Kent with ships and resources from Boulogne, with the task of retaking the key port of Dover, under Robert&#x27;s control. A small number of Stephen&#x27;s household knights were sent north to help the fight against the Scots, where David&#x27;s forces were defeated later that year at the Battle of the Standard in August by the forces of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Despite this victory, David still occupied most of the north of England. Stephen himself went west in an attempt to regain control of Gloucestershire, first striking north into the Welsh Marches, taking Hereford and Shrewsbury, then heading south to Bath. Bristol proved too strong for him, and Stephen contented himself with raiding and pillaging the surrounding area. The rebels appear to have expected Robert to intervene with support, but he remained in Normandy throughout the year, trying to persuade the Empress Matilda to invade England herself. Dover finally surrendered to the queen&#x27;s forces later in the year.

Stephen&#x27;s military campaign in England had progressed well, and historian David Crouch describes it as &quot;a military achievement of the first rank&quot;. The king took the opportunity of his military advantage to forge a peace agreement with Scotland. Stephen&#x27;s wife Matilda was sent to negotiate another agreement between Stephen and David, called the treaty of Durham; Northumbria and Cumbria would effectively be granted to David and his son Henry, in exchange for their fealty and future peace along the border. The powerful Ranulf, Earl of Chester, considered himself to hold the traditional rights to Carlisle and Cumberland and was extremely displeased to see them being given to the Scots, a problem which would have long lasting implications in the war.

===Preparations for war (1139)===

By 1139, an invasion of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent the beginning of the year mobilising forces ready for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy at the start of the year, putting forward her legal claim to the English throne; the pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda&#x27;s perspective the case usefully established that Stephen&#x27;s claim was disputed.

Meanwhile, Stephen prepared for the coming conflict by creating a number of additional earldoms. Only a handful of earldoms had existed under Henry I and these had been largely symbolic in nature. Stephen created many more, filling them with men he considered to be loyal, capable military commanders, and in the more vulnerable parts of the country assigning them new lands and additional executive powers. Stephen appears to have had several objectives in mind, including both ensuring the loyalty of his key supporters by granting them these honours, and improving his defences in vulnerable parts of the kingdom. Stephen was heavily influenced by his principal advisor, Waleran de Beaumont, the twin brother of Robert of Leicester. The Beaumont twins and their younger brother and cousins received the majority of these new earldoms. From 1138 onwards, Stephen gave them the earldoms of Worcester, Leicester, Hertford, Warwick and Pembroke, which—especially when combined with the possessions of Stephen&#x27;s new ally, Prince Henry, in Cumberland and Northumbria—created a wide block of territory to act as a buffer zone between the troubled south-west, Chester and the rest of the kingdom.

Stephen took steps to remove a group of bishops he regarded as a threat to his rule. The royal administration under Henry I had been headed by Roger, the Bishop of Salisbury, supported by Roger&#x27;s nephews, Alexander and Nigel, the Bishops of Lincoln and Ely respectively, and Roger&#x27;s son, Roger le Poer, who was the Lord Chancellor. These bishops were powerful landowners as well as ecclesiastical rulers, and they had begun to build new castles and increase the size of their military forces, leading Stephen to suspect that they were about to defect to the Empress Matilda. Roger and his family were also enemies of Waleran, who disliked their control of the royal administration. In June 1139, Stephen held his court in Oxford, where a fight between Alan of Brittany and Roger&#x27;s men broke out, an incident probably deliberately created by Stephen. Stephen responded by demanding that Roger and the other bishops surrender all of their castles in England. This threat was backed up by the arrest of the bishops, with the exception of Nigel who had taken refuge in Devizes Castle; the bishop only surrendered after Stephen besieged the castle and threatened to execute Roger le Poer. The remaining castles were then surrendered to the king. The incident removed any military threat from the bishops, but it may have damaged Stephen&#x27;s relationship with the senior clergy, and in particular with his brother Henry. Both sides were now ready for war.

==Warfare==
===Technology and tactics===

Anglo-Norman warfare during the civil war was characterised by attritional military campaigns, in which commanders tried to raid enemy lands and seize castles in order to allow them to take control of their adversaries&#x27; territory, ultimately winning slow, strategic victories. Occasionally pitched battles were fought between armies but these were considered highly risky endeavours and were usually avoided by prudent commanders. Despite the use of feudal levies, Norman warfare traditionally depended on rulers raising and spending large sums of cash. The cost of warfare had risen considerably in the first part of the 12th century, and adequate supplies of ready cash were increasingly proving important in the success of campaigns.

Stephen and Matilda&#x27;s households centred on small bodies of knights called the &quot;familia regis&quot;; this inner circle formed the basis for a headquarters in any military campaign. The armies of the period were still similar to those of the previous century, comprising bodies of mounted, armoured knights, supported by infantry. Many of these men would have worn long mail hauberks, with helmets, greaves and arm protection. Swords were common, along with lances for cavalry; crossbowmen had become more numerous, and longbows were occasionally used in battle alongside the older shortbow. These forces were either feudal levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign or, increasingly, mercenaries, who were expensive but more flexible in the duration of their service and often more skilled.

The Normans had first developed castles in the 10th and 11th centuries, and their occupation of England after 1066 had made extensive use of them. Most castles took the form of earthwork and timber motte-and-bailey or ringwork constructs; easily built with local labour and resources, these were resilient and easy to defend. The Anglo-Norman elite became adept at strategically placing these castles along rivers and valleys to control populations, trade and regions. In the decades before the civil war, some newer, stone-built keeps had begun to be introduced. Unlike the more traditional designs, these required expensive skilled labourers and could only be built slowly over many seasons. Although these square keeps later proved to have vulnerabilities, the ballistae and mangonels used in the 1140s were significantly less powerful than the later trebuchet designs, giving defenders a substantial advantage over attackers. As a result, slow sieges to starve defenders out, or mining operations to undermine walls, tended to be preferred by commanders over direct assaults.
Both sides responded by building new castles, sometimes creating systems of strategic fortifications. In the south-west Matilda&#x27;s supporters built a range of castles to protect the territory, usually motte-and-bailey designs such as those at Winchcombe, Upper Slaughter, or Bampton. Similarly, Stephen built a new chain of fen-edge castles at Burwell, Lidgate, Rampton, Caxton, and Swavesey – each about six to nine miles (ten to fifteen km) apart – in order to protect his lands around Cambridge. Many of these castles were termed &quot;adulterine&quot;, unauthorised, because, in the chaos of the war, no royal permission had given to the lord for their construction. Contemporary chroniclers saw this as a matter of concern; Robert of Torigni suggested that as many as 1,115 such castles had been built during the conflict, although this was probably an exaggeration as elsewhere he suggests an alternative figure of 126.

Another feature of the war was the creation of many &quot;counter-castles&quot;. or &quot;siege castles&quot;. At least 17 such sites have been identified through documentary and archaeological research, but this likely under-estimates the number that were built during the conflict. These had been used in English conflicts for several years before the civil war and involved building a basic castle during a siege, alongside the main target of attack. Typically these would be built in either a ringwork or a motte-and-bailey design between 200 and 300 yards (180 to 270 metres) away from the target, just beyond the range of a bow. Counter-castles could be used to either act as platforms for siege weaponry, or as bases for controlling the region in their own right. Most siege castles were intended for temporary use and were often destroyed (slighted) afterwards. While most survive poorly, the earthworks of &#x27;the Rings&#x27; near Corfe Castle in Dorset is an unusually well preserved example.

===Leaders===
King Stephen was extremely wealthy, well-mannered, modest and liked by his peers; he was also considered a man capable of firm action. His personal qualities as a military leader focused on his skill in personal combat, his capabilities in siege warfare and a remarkable ability to move military forces quickly over relatively long distances. Rumours of his father&#x27;s cowardice during the First Crusade continued to circulate, and a desire to avoid the same reputation may have influenced some of Stephen&#x27;s rasher military actions. Stephen drew heavily on his wife, Queen Matilda of Boulogne (not to be confused with Empress Matilda), during the conflict, both for leading negotiations and maintaining his cause and army while imprisoned in 1141; Matilda led the royal household during this period in partnership with Stephen&#x27;s mercenary leader William of Ypres.

The Empress&#x27;s faction lacked an equivalent war leader to Stephen. Matilda had a firm grounding in government from her time as empress, where she had presided in court cases and acted as regent in Italy with the Imperial army on campaign. Nonetheless, Matilda, as a woman, could not personally lead forces into battle. Matilda was less popular with contemporary chroniclers than Stephen; in many ways she took after her father, being prepared to loudly demand compliance of her court, when necessary issuing threats and generally appearing arrogant. This was felt to be particularly inappropriate since she was a woman. Matilda&#x27;s husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, played an important role in seizing Normandy during the war but did not cross into England. Geoffrey and Matilda&#x27;s marriage was not an easy one; it had almost collapsed altogether in 1130.

For most of the war, therefore, the Angevin armies were led into battle by a handful of senior nobles. The most important of these was Robert of Gloucester, the half-brother of the Empress. He was known for his qualities as a statesman, his military experience and leadership ability. Robert had tried to convince Theobald to take the throne in 1135; he did not attend Stephen&#x27;s first court in 1136 and it took several summonses to convince him to attend court at Oxford later that year. Miles of Gloucester was another capable military leader up until his death in 1143; there were some political tensions between him and Robert, but the two could work together on campaigns. One of Matilda&#x27;s most loyal followers was Brian Fitz Count, like Miles a marcher lord from Wales. Fitz Count was apparently motivated by a strong moral duty to uphold his oath to Matilda and proved critical in defending the Thames corridor.

==Civil war==
===Initial phase (1139–1140)===

The Angevin invasion finally arrived in August. Baldwin de Redvers crossed over from Normandy to Wareham in an initial attempt to capture a port to receive the Empress Matilda&#x27;s invading army, but Stephen&#x27;s forces forced him to retreat into the south-west. The following month the Empress was invited by the Dowager Queen Adeliza to land at Arundel instead, and on 30 September Robert of Gloucester and the Empress arrived in England with 140 knights. Matilda stayed at Arundel Castle, whilst Robert marched north-west to Wallingford and Bristol, hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with Miles of Gloucester, who took the opportunity to renounce his fealty to the king.

Stephen responded by promptly moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then agreed to a truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the truce are not known, but the results were that Stephen first released Matilda from the siege and then allowed her and her household of knights to be escorted to the south-west, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasoning behind Stephen&#x27;s decision to release his rival remains unclear. Contemporary chroniclers suggested that Henry argued that it would be in Stephen&#x27;s own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, and Stephen may have seen Robert, not the Empress, as his main opponent at this point in the conflict. Stephen also faced a military dilemma at Arundel—the castle was considered almost impregnable, and he may have been worried that he was tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen was certainly known for having a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.

Although there had been few new defections to the Empress, Matilda now controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south-west into Devon and Cornwall, west into the Welsh Marches and east as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. She had established her court in Gloucester, close to Robert&#x27;s stronghold of Bristol but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother. Stephen set about reclaiming the region. He started by attacking Wallingford Castle which controlled the Thames corridor; it was held by Brien FitzCount and Stephen found it too well defended. Stephen left behind some forces to blockade the castle and continued west into Wiltshire to attack Trowbridge, taking the castles of South Cerney and Malmesbury en route. Meanwhile, Miles of Gloucester marched east, attacking Stephen&#x27;s rearguard forces at Wallingford and threatening an advance on London. Stephen was forced to give up his western campaign, returning east to stabilise the situation and protect his capital.
At the start of 1140, Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, whose castles Stephen had confiscated the previous year, rebelled against Stephen as well. Nigel hoped to seize East Anglia and established his base of operations in the Isle of Ely, then surrounded by protective fenland. Stephen responded quickly, taking an army into the fens and using boats lashed together to form a causeway that allowed him to make a surprise attack on the isle. Nigel escaped to Gloucester, but his men and castle were captured, and order was temporarily restored in the east. Robert of Gloucester&#x27;s men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, at which Robert represented the Empress, and Queen Matilda and Archbishop Theobald the King. The conference collapsed over the insistence by Henry and the clergy that they should set the terms of any peace deal, which Stephen found unacceptable.

Ranulf of Chester remained upset over Stephen&#x27;s gift of the north of England to Prince Henry. Ranulf devised a plan for dealing with the problem by ambushing Henry whilst the prince was travelling back from Stephen&#x27;s court to Scotland after Christmas. Stephen responded to rumours of this plan by escorting Henry himself north, but this gesture proved the final straw for Ranulf. Ranulf had previously claimed that he had the rights to Lincoln Castle, held by Stephen, and under the guise of a social visit, Ranulf seized the fortification in a surprise attack. Stephen marched north to Lincoln and agreed to a truce with Ranulf, probably to keep him from joining the Empress&#x27;s faction, under which Ranulf would be allowed to keep the castle. Stephen returned to London but received news that Ranulf, his brother and their family were relaxing in Lincoln Castle with a minimal guard force, a ripe target for a surprise attack of his own. Abandoning the deal he had just made, Stephen gathered his army again and sped north, but not quite fast enough—Ranulf escaped Lincoln and declared his support for the Empress, and Stephen was forced to place the castle under siege.

===Second phase (1141–1142)===
====Battle of Lincoln====

While Stephen and his army besieged Lincoln Castle at the start of 1141, Robert of Gloucester and Ranulf of Chester advanced on the king&#x27;s position with a somewhat larger force. When the news reached Stephen, he held a council to decide whether to give battle or to withdraw and gather additional soldiers: Stephen decided to fight, resulting in the Battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141. The king commanded the centre of his army, with Alan of Brittany on his right and William of Aumale on his left. Robert and Ranulf&#x27;s forces had superiority in cavalry and Stephen dismounted many of his own knights to form a solid infantry block; he joined them himself, fighting on foot in the battle. Stephen was not a gifted public speaker, and delegated the pre-battle speech to Baldwin of Clare, who delivered a rousing declaration. After an initial success in which William&#x27;s forces destroyed the Angevins&#x27; Welsh infantry, the battle went badly for Stephen. Robert and Ranulf&#x27;s cavalry encircled Stephen&#x27;s centre, and the king found himself surrounded by the enemy army. Many of Stephen&#x27;s supporters, including Waleron de Beaumont and William of Ypres, fled from the field at this point but Stephen fought on, defending himself first with his sword and then, when that broke, with a borrowed battle axe. Finally, he was overwhelmed by Robert&#x27;s men and taken away from the field in custody.

Robert took Stephen back to Gloucester, where the king met with the Empress Matilda, and was then moved to Bristol Castle, traditionally used for holding high-status prisoners. He was initially left confined in relatively good conditions, but his security was later tightened and he was kept in chains. The Empress now began to take the necessary steps to have herself crowned queen in his place, which would require the agreement of the church and her coronation at Westminster Abbey. Stephen&#x27;s brother Henry summoned a council at Winchester before Easter in his capacity as papal legate to consider the clergy&#x27;s view. He had made a private deal with the Empress Matilda that he would deliver the support of the church, if she agreed to give him control over church business in England. Henry handed over the royal treasury, rather depleted except for Stephen&#x27;s crown, to the Empress, and excommunicated many of Stephen&#x27;s supporters who refused to switch sides. Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was unwilling to declare Matilda queen so rapidly, and a delegation of clergy and nobles, headed by Theobald, travelled to see Stephen in Bristol and consult about their moral dilemma: if they should abandon their oaths of fealty to the king. Stephen agreed that, given the situation, he was prepared to release his subjects from their oath of fealty to him.

The clergy gathered again in Winchester after Easter to declare the Empress &quot;Lady of England and Normandy&quot; as a precursor to her coronation. While Matilda&#x27;s own followers attended the event, few other major nobles seem to have attended and a delegation from London prevaricated. Queen Matilda wrote to complain and demand Stephen&#x27;s release. The Empress Matilda then advanced to London to stage her coronation in June, where her position became precarious. Despite securing the support of Geoffrey de Mandeville, who controlled the Tower of London, forces loyal to Stephen and Queen Matilda remained close to the city and the citizens were fearful about welcoming the Empress. On 24 June, shortly before the planned coronation, the city rose up against the Empress and Geoffrey de Mandeville; Matilda and her followers only just fled in time, making a chaotic retreat to Oxford.

Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Anjou invaded Normandy again and, in the absence of Waleran of Beaumont, who was still fighting in England, Geoffrey took all the duchy south of the River Seine and east of the Risle. No help was forthcoming from Stephen&#x27;s brother Theobald this time either, who appears to have been preoccupied with his own problems with France—the new French king, Louis VII, had rejected his father&#x27;s regional alliance, improving relations with Anjou and taking a more bellicose line with Theobald, which would result in war the following year. Geoffrey&#x27;s success in Normandy and Stephen&#x27;s weakness in England began to influence the loyalty of many Anglo-Norman barons, who feared losing their lands in England to Robert and the Empress, and their possessions in Normandy to Geoffrey. Many started to leave Stephen&#x27;s faction. His friend and advisor Waleron was one of those who decided to defect in mid-1141, crossing into Normandy to secure his ancestral possessions by allying himself with the Angevins, and bringing Worcestershire into the Empress&#x27;s camp. Waleron&#x27;s twin brother, Robert of Leicester, effectively withdrew from fighting in the conflict at the same time. Other supporters of the Empress were restored in their former strongholds, such as Bishop Nigel of Ely, and others still received new earldoms in the west of England. The royal control over the minting of coins broke down, leading to coins being struck by local barons and bishops across the country.

====Rout of Winchester and the siege of Oxford====
Stephen&#x27;s wife Matilda played a critical part in keeping the king&#x27;s cause alive during his captivity. Queen Matilda gathered Stephen&#x27;s remaining lieutenants around her and the royal family in the south-east, advancing into London when the population rejected the Empress. Stephen&#x27;s long-standing commander William of Ypres remained with the queen in London; William Martel, the royal steward, commanded operations from Sherborne in Dorset, and Faramus of Boulogne ran the royal household. The queen appears to have generated genuine sympathy and support from Stephen&#x27;s more loyal followers. Henry&#x27;s alliance with the Empress proved short-lived, as they soon fell out over political patronage and ecclesiastical policy; the bishop met Stephen&#x27;s wife Queen Matilda at Guildford and transferred his support to her.

The Empress&#x27;s position was transformed by her defeat at the rout of Winchester. Following their retreat from London, Robert of Gloucester and the Empress besieged Henry in his episcopal castle at Winchester in July. Matilda was using the royal castle in the city of Winchester as a base for her operations, but shortly afterwards Queen Matilda and William of Ypres then encircled the Angevin forces with their own army, reinforced with fresh troops from London. The Empress Matilda decided to escape from the city with her close associates Fitz Count and Reginald of Cornwall, while the rest of her army delayed the royal forces. In the subsequent battle the Empress&#x27;s forces were defeated and Robert of Gloucester himself was taken prisoner during the retreat, although Matilda herself escaped, exhausted, to her fortress at Devizes.

With both Stephen and Robert held prisoner, negotiations were held to try to agree a long term peace settlement, but Queen Matilda was unwilling to offer any compromise to the Empress, and Robert refused to accept any offer to encourage him to change sides to Stephen. Instead, in November the two sides simply exchanged the two leaders, Stephen returning to his queen, and Robert to the Empress in Oxford. Henry held another church council, which reversed its previous decision and reaffirmed Stephen&#x27;s legitimacy to rule, and a fresh coronation of Stephen and Matilda occurred at Christmas 1141. At the beginning of 1142 Stephen fell ill, and by Easter rumours had begun to circulate that he had died. Possibly this illness was the result of his imprisonment the previous year, but he finally recovered and travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully convince Ranulf of Chester to change sides once again. Stephen then spent the summer attacking some of the new Angevin castles built the previous year, including Cirencester, Bampton and Wareham.

During mid-1142 Robert returned to Normandy to assist Geoffrey with operations against some of Stephen&#x27;s remaining followers there; he returned to England later in the year. Meanwhile, Matilda came under increased pressure from Stephen&#x27;s forces and had become surrounded at Oxford. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the River Isis, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming part of the way. Once on the other side, the king and his men broke into the town, trapping the Empress in the castle. Oxford Castle was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen had to settle down for a long siege, secure in the knowledge that Matilda was now surrounded. Just before Christmas, the Empress sneaked out of the castle, crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape past the royal army to safety at Wallingford, leaving the castle garrison free to surrender the next day. Matilda stayed with Fitz Count for a period, then reestablished her court at Devizes.

===Stalemate (1143–1146)===

The war between the two sides in England reached a stalemate in the mid-1140s, while Geoffrey of Anjou consolidated his hold on power in Normandy, being recognised as duke of Normandy after taking Rouen in 1144. 1143 started precariously for Stephen when he was besieged by Robert of Gloucester at Wilton Castle, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the Battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, and for a moment it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time. On this occasion William Martel, Stephen&#x27;s steward, made a fierce rear guard effort, allowing Stephen to escape from the battlefield. Stephen valued William&#x27;s loyalty sufficiently to agree to exchange Sherborne Castle for his safe release—this was one of the few instances where Stephen was prepared to give up a castle to ransom one of his men.

In late 1143, Stephen faced a new threat in the east, when Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in rebellion against the king in East Anglia. Stephen had disliked the baron for several years, and provoked the conflict by summoning Geoffrey to court, where the king arrested him. Stephen threatened to execute Geoffrey unless the baron handed over his various castles, including the Tower of London, Saffron Walden and Pleshey, all important fortifications because they were in, or close to, London. Geoffrey gave in, but once free he headed north-east into the Fens to the Isle of Ely, from where he began a military campaign against Cambridge, with the intention of progressing south towards London. With all of his other problems and with Hugh Bigod still in open revolt in Norfolk, Stephen lacked the resources to track Geoffrey down in the Fens and made do with building a screen of castles between Ely and London, including Burwell Castle.

For a period, the situation continued to worsen. Ranulf of Chester revolted once again in the middle of 1144, splitting up Stephen&#x27;s Honour of Lancaster between himself and Prince Henry. In the west, Robert of Gloucester and his followers continued to raid the surrounding royalist territories, and Wallingford Castle remained a secure Angevin stronghold, too close to London for comfort. Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Anjou finished securing his hold on southern Normandy and in January 1144 he advanced into Rouen, the capital of the duchy, concluding his campaign. Louis VII recognised him as Duke of Normandy shortly after. By this point in the war, Stephen was depending increasingly on his immediate royal household, such as William of Ypres and others, and lacked the support of the major barons who might have been able to provide him with significant additional forces; after the events of 1141, Stephen made little use of his network of earls.

After 1143 the war ground on, but progressing slightly better for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, one of the most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville&#x27;s rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the king recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, then arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over several castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen. By this point, Stephen&#x27;s practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.

===Final phases (1147–1152)===
The character of the conflict in England gradually began to shift; as historian Frank Barlow suggests, by the late 1140s &quot;the civil war was over&quot;, barring the occasional outbreak of fighting. In 1147 Robert of Gloucester died peacefully, and the next year the Empress Matilda defused an argument with the Church over the ownership of Devizes Castle by returning to Normandy, contributing to reducing the tempo of the war. The Second Crusade was announced, and many Angevin supporters, including Waleran of Beaumont, joined it, leaving the region for several years. Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their lands and war gains. Geoffrey and Matilda&#x27;s son, the future King Henry II, mounted a small mercenary invasion of England in 1147 but the expedition failed, not least because Henry lacked the funds to pay his men. Stephen himself ended up paying their costs, allowing Henry to return home safely; his reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; another is that he was starting to consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry.

Many of the most powerful nobles began to make their own truces and disarmament agreements, signing treaties between one another that typically promised an end to bilateral hostilities, limited the building of new castles, or agreed limits to the size of armies sent against one another. Typically these treaties included clauses that recognised that the nobles might, of course, be forced to fight each other by instruction of their rulers. A network of treaties had emerged by the 1150s, reducing – but not eliminating – the degree of local fighting in England.

Matilda remained in Normandy for the rest of the war, focusing on stabilising the duchy and promoting her son&#x27;s rights to the English throne. The young Henry FitzEmpress returned to England again in 1149, this time planning to form a northern alliance with Ranulf of Chester. The Angevin plan involved Ranulf agreeing to give up his claim to Carlisle, held by the Scots, in return for being given the rights to the whole of the Honour of Lancaster; Ranulf would give homage to both David and Henry FitzEmpress, with Henry having seniority. Following this peace agreement, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, probably with help from the Scots. Stephen marched rapidly north to York and the planned attack disintegrated, leaving Henry to return to Normandy, where he was declared Duke by his father. Although still young, Henry was increasingly gaining a reputation as an energetic and capable leader. His prestige and power increased further when he unexpectedly married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152; Eleanor was the attractive Duchess of Aquitaine and the recently divorced wife of Louis VII of France, and the marriage made Henry the future ruler of a huge swathe of territory across France.

In the final years of the war, Stephen too began to focus on the issue of his family and the succession. Stephen had given his eldest son Eustace the County of Boulogne in 1147, but it remained unclear whether Eustace would inherit England. Stephen&#x27;s preferred option was to have Eustace crowned while he himself was still alive, as was the custom in France, but this was not the normal practice in England, and Celestine II, during his brief tenure as pope between 1143 and 1144, had banned any change to this practice. The only person who could crown Eustace was Archbishop Theobald, who may well have seen the coronation of Eustace only as a guarantee of further civil war after Stephen&#x27;s death; the Archbishop refused to crown Eustace without agreement from the current pope, Eugene III, and the matter reached an impasse. Stephen&#x27;s situation was made worse by various arguments with members of the Church over rights and privileges. Stephen made a fresh attempt to have Eustace crowned at Easter 1152, gathering his nobles to swear fealty to Eustace, and then insisting that Theobald and his bishops anoint him king. When Theobald refused yet again, Stephen and Eustace imprisoned both him and the bishops and refused to release them unless they agreed to crown Eustace. Theobald escaped again into temporary exile in Flanders, pursued to the coast by Stephen&#x27;s knights, marking a low point in Stephen&#x27;s relationship with the church.

==End of the war==
===Peace negotiations (1153–1154)===

Henry FitzEmpress returned to England again at the start of 1153 with a small army, supported in the north and east of England by Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod. Stephen&#x27;s castle at Malmesbury was besieged by Henry&#x27;s forces and the king responded by marching west with an army to relieve it. Stephen unsuccessfully attempted to force Henry&#x27;s smaller army to fight a decisive battle along the River Avon. In the face of the increasingly wintry weather, Stephen agreed to a temporary truce and returned to London, leaving Henry to travel north through the Midlands where the powerful Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, announced his support for the Angevin cause. Despite only modest military successes, Henry and his allies now controlled the south-west, the Midlands and much of the north of England. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter. Many of the details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.

Stephen intensified the long-running siege of Wallingford Castle in a final attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south in an attempt to relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen&#x27;s besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle. As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.

In the aftermath of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry spoke together privately about a potential end to the war; Stephen&#x27;s son Eustace was furious about the peaceful outcome at Wallingford. He left his father and returned home to Cambridge to gather more funds for a fresh campaign, where he fell ill and died the next month. Eustace&#x27;s death removed an obvious claimant to the throne and was politically convenient for those seeking a permanent peace in England. It is possible that Stephen had already begun to consider passing over Eustace&#x27;s claim; historian Edmund King observes that Eustace&#x27;s claim to the throne was not mentioned in the discussions at Wallingford, for example, and this may have added to Stephen&#x27;s son&#x27;s anger.

Fighting continued after Wallingford, but in a rather half-hearted fashion. Stephen lost the towns of Oxford and Stamford to Henry while the king was diverted fighting Hugh Bigod in the east of England, but Nottingham Castle survived an Angevin attempt to capture it. Meanwhile, Stephen&#x27;s brother Henry of Blois and Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury were for once unified in an effort to broker a permanent peace between the two sides, putting pressure on Stephen to accept a deal. Stephen and Henry FitzEmpress&#x27;s armies met again at Winchester, where the two leaders would ratify the terms of a permanent peace in November. Stephen announced the Treaty of Winchester in Winchester Cathedral: he recognised Henry FitzEmpress as his adopted son and successor, in return for Henry doing homage to him; Stephen promised to listen to Henry&#x27;s advice, but retained all his royal powers; Stephen&#x27;s remaining son, William, would do homage to Henry and renounce his claim to the throne, in exchange for promises of the security of his lands; key royal castles would be held on Henry&#x27;s behalf by guarantors whilst Stephen would have access to Henry&#x27;s castles; and the numerous foreign mercenaries would be demobilised and sent home. Stephen and Henry sealed the treaty with a kiss of peace in the cathedral.

===Transition and reconstruction (1154–1165)===

Stephen&#x27;s decision to recognise Henry as his heir was, at the time, not necessarily a final solution to the civil war. Despite the issuing of new currency and administrative reforms, Stephen might potentially have lived for many more years, whilst Henry&#x27;s position on the continent was far from secure. Although Stephen&#x27;s son William was young and unprepared to challenge Henry for the throne in 1153, the situation could well have shifted in subsequent years—there were widespread rumours during 1154 that William planned to assassinate Henry, for example. Historian Graham White describes the treaty of Winchester as a &quot;precarious peace&quot;, capturing the judgement of most modern historians that the situation in late 1153 was still uncertain and unpredictable. Nonetheless, Stephen burst into activity in early 1154, travelling around the kingdom extensively. He began issuing royal writs for the south-west of England once again and travelled to York where he held a major court in an attempt to impress upon the northern barons that royal authority was being reasserted. In 1154, Stephen travelled to Dover to meet the Count of Flanders; some historians believe that the king was already ill and preparing to settle his family affairs. Stephen fell ill with a stomach disorder and died on 25 October.

Henry did not feel it necessary to hurry back to England immediately. On landing on 8 December 1154, Henry quickly took oaths of loyalty from some of the barons and was then crowned alongside Eleanor at Westminster. The royal court was gathered in April 1155, where the barons swore fealty to the king and his sons. Henry presented himself as the legitimate heir to Henry I and commenced rebuilding the kingdom in his image. Although Stephen had tried to continue Henry I&#x27;s method of government during the war, the new government characterised the 19 years of Stephen&#x27;s reign as a chaotic and troubled period, with all these problems resulting from Stephen&#x27;s usurpation of the throne. Henry was also careful to show that, unlike his mother the Empress, he would listen to the advice and counsel of others. Various measures were immediately carried out, although, since Henry spent six and a half of the first eight years of his reign in France, much work had to be done at a distance.

England had suffered extensively during the war. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; recorded how &quot;there was nothing but disturbance and wickedness and robbery&quot;. Certainly in many parts of the country, such as the South-West, the Thames Valley and East Anglia, the fighting and raiding had caused serious devastation. The previously centralised royal coinage system was fragmented, with Stephen, the Empress and local lords all minting their own coins. The royal forest law had collapsed in large parts of the country. Some parts of the country, though, were barely touched by the conflict—for example, Stephen&#x27;s lands in the south-east and the Angevin heartlands around Gloucester and Bristol were largely unaffected, and David I ruled his territories in the north of England effectively. The king&#x27;s overall income from his estates declined seriously during the conflict, particularly after 1141, and royal control over the minting of new coins remained limited outside of the south-east and East Anglia. With Stephen often based in the south-east, increasingly Westminster, rather than the older site of Winchester, was used as the centre of royal government.

Among Henry&#x27;s first measures was to expel the remaining foreign mercenaries and continue the process of demolishing the unauthorised castles. Robert of Torigni recorded that 375 were destroyed, without giving the details behind the figure; recent studies of selected regions have suggested that fewer castles were probably destroyed than once thought and that many may simply have been abandoned at the end of the conflict. Henry also gave a high priority to restoring the royal finances, reviving Henry I&#x27;s financial processes and attempting to improve the standard of the accounts. By the 1160s, this process of financial recovery was essentially complete.

The post-war period also saw a surge of activity around the English borders. The king of Scotland and local Welsh rulers had taken advantage of the long civil war in England to seize disputed lands; Henry set about reversing this trend. In 1157 pressure from Henry resulted in the young Malcolm IV of Scotland returning the lands in the north of England he had taken during the war; Henry promptly began to refortify the northern frontier. Restoring Anglo-Norman supremacy in Wales proved harder, and Henry had to fight two campaigns in north and south Wales in 1157 and 1158 before the Welsh princes Owain Gwynedd and Rhys ap Gruffydd submitted to his rule, agreeing to the pre-civil war division of lands.

==Legacy==
===Historiography===
Much of the modern history of the civil war of the Anarchy is based on accounts of chroniclers who lived in, or close to, the middle of the 12th century, forming a relatively rich account of the period. All of the main chronicler accounts carry significant regional biases in how they portray the disparate events. Several of the key chronicles were written in the south-west of England, including the &quot;Gesta Stephani&quot;, or &quot;Acts of Stephen&quot;, and William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;Historia Novella&quot;, or &quot;New History&quot;. In Normandy, Orderic Vitalis wrote his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, covering the period until 1141, and Robert of Torigni wrote a later history of the rest of the later years. Henry of Huntingdon, who lived in the east of England, produced the &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; that provides a regional account of the conflict. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; was past its prime by the time of the war, but the version maintained at Peterborough Abbey (today known as the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot;) is remembered for its striking account of conditions during the Anarchy, in particular its description that &quot;men said openly that Christ and his saints were asleep&quot;. Most of the chronicles carry some bias for or against the key political figures in the conflict.

The use of the term &quot;the Anarchy&quot; to describe the civil war has been subject to much critical discussion. The phrase itself originates in the late Victorian period. Many historians of the time traced a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period. William Stubbs, following in this &quot;Whiggish&quot; tradition, analysed the political aspects of the period in his 1874 volume the &quot;Constitutional History of England&quot;. This work highlighted an apparent break in the development of the English constitution in the 1140s, and caused his student John Round to coin the term &quot;the Anarchy&quot; to describe the period. Later historians critiqued the term, as analysis of the financial records and other documents from the period suggested that the breakdown in law and order during the conflict had been more nuanced and localised than chronicler accounts alone might have suggested. Further work in the 1990s reinterpreted Henry&#x27;s efforts in the post-war reconstruction period, suggesting a greater level of continuity with Stephen&#x27;s wartime government than had previously been supposed. The label of &quot;the Anarchy&quot; remains in use by modern historians, but rarely without qualification.

The civil war years of the Anarchy have been occasionally used in historical fiction. Stephen, Matilda and their supporters feature in Ellis Peters&#x27; historical detective series about Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters&#x27; depiction of the civil war is an essentially local narrative, focused on Shrewsbury and its environs. Peters paints Stephen as a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler, despite his execution of the Shrewsbury defenders after taking the town in 1138. In contrast, Ken Follett&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; and the TV mini-series based on it depict Stephen as an incapable ruler. Although Follett begins his book with Austin Poole&#x27;s account of the &quot;White Ship&quot;&#x27;s sinking to set the historical scene for the subsequent events, in many other ways Follett uses the war as a location for a story about essentially modern personalities and issues, a feature reproduced in the epic costume TV adaptation.

<text>Sheringham Park is a landscape park and gardens near the town of Sheringham, Norfolk, England. The park surrounds Sheringham Hall, lying mostly to its south. The freehold of the hall is owned by the National Trust and is privately leased on a long leasehold. Visitors to this historic building must contact the leaseholder directly for an appointment. The plantations of Sheringham Park are in the care of the National Trust and open to visitors. National Trust members and guests have no rights of access across the park and farmland surrounding Sheringham Hall. Access to these areas is solely at the discretion of George Youngs (Farms) Ltd which farms the Sheringham estate, as laid out in the 1953 agreement between that farming company and the then freeholder. Access to the plantations of Sheringham Park has become an important aspect to locals of Sheringham and visitors alike and reference to this can be found in the Domesday Book, page 56.

The park was designed by Humphry Repton (1752–1818) who presented his proposals in July 1812 in the form of one of his Red Books. He described Sheringham as his &quot;favourite and darling child in Norfolk&quot;. Abbot and Charlotte Upcher bought the estate in 1811, and successive generations of the Upcher family did much to develop the estate, the hall and the park, as well as building a school.

There are fine mature woodlands and a large variety of rhododendrons and azaleas. In the early 20th century, Henry Morris Upcher obtained rhododendron seeds of various types from plantsman Ernest &quot;Chinese&quot; Wilson. Plants from this source which can found at the garden include &quot;Rhododendron ambiguum&quot;, &quot;calophytum&quot; and &quot;decorum&quot;, among others. Many other species of tree and shrub are represented in the garden, including fifteen kinds of magnolia, large specimen pieris. Among the other trees are maples, acers, styrax, eucryphia, pocket handkerchief tree davidia involucrata and a fine example of the snowdrop tree. Several overlook towers provide good views over the plantations, and of the nearby coast and surrounding countryside. A garden temple was constructed in the park in 1975 to the designs of James Fletcher-Watson.

==Location==
Sheringham Park is located 2 miles south west of the coastal town of Sheringham, 5 miles west of Cromer and 6 miles east of Holt. The main entrance is at the junction of the A148 Cromer to Holt road and the B1157 road to Upper Sheringham. The Norfolk Coast Path passes through the property. A car park, cafe and visitor centre are near the main entrance. Waymarked paths through the estate link the gardens and visitors centre to the coast, and to the Weybourne station on the North Norfolk Railway, a preserved steam railway. Pedestrian access to the park is from the village of Upper Sheringham, which is adjacent to the park.

==Visitor centre==
The visitor centre is located within Wood Farm Barn at the southern end of the park, the barn also houses an exhibition of the history and the wildlife of Sheringham Park. Together with a reception desk and information kiosk. From the reception there are hearing loops available. Wheelchairs and powered mobility vehicles available at no charge although it is necessary to take a small test before use. The refreshment kiosk is also at Wood Farm Barn.

The exhibition area explores the life and work of the landscape architect Humphry Repton and also of the Upcher family who owned the park. There are several examples of Humphry Repton&#x27;s red book of plans for the designs of the park. Part of the exhibition area has an area dedicated to the wildlife and nature of the park with identification games and interactive displays.

=== Volunteers ===
The park has a group of regular volunteers who help the garden staff with their duties. Under the guidance of the head gardener they undertake tasks such as pruning trees and other tasks, and generally keeping the park in a condition fit for visitors.

== Sheringham Hall ==
The Regency, Grade II listed building is finished in grey, gault, Lincolnshire brick was designed and built by Humphry Repton and his architect son, John Adey Repton. Due to the Norfolk coast&#x27;s glacial winds, Repton chose a south facing site in the lee of a wooded hillside. In July 1813 the Upcher family laid the foundation stone and the family hoped to move into the house in the summer of 1817, but the owner of the estate Abbot Upcher fell ill and died in 1819 at the age of 35. The hall remained empty for 20 years until Henry Ramey Upcher completed the house in 1839.

The hall&#x27;s lease was offered for sale in 2008 and the lease was further extended at that time.

<text>Cayor (; ) was from 1549 to 1876 the largest and most powerful kingdom that split off from the Jolof Empire in what is now Senegal. Cayor was located in northern and central Senegal, southeast of Waalo, west of the kingdom of Jolof, and north of Baol and the Kingdom of Sine.

==Etymology==
Cayor (also spelled Kayor, Kadior, Cadior, Kadjoor, Nkadyur, Kadyoor, Encalhor, among others) comes from the Wolof endonym for the inhabitants &quot;Waadyor&quot; meaning &quot;people of the &quot;joor&quot;&quot;, a fertile soil found in northern Cayor. This distinguishes the people of Cayor from their neighbors, who to the present day refer to themselves by doubling the name of their native region (Waalo-Waalo, Saloum-Saloum e.g.).

== History ==
There are no written sources for the early history of Cayor, and even oral traditions are sparse. The legend of Ndiadiane Ndiaye, the first &quot;Buurba Jolof&quot;, claims that the ruler of Cayor voluntarily submitted to him, but this is likely a later invention to celebrate the unity of the empire. Cayor certainly existed before its integration into the empire, as the kings lists preserved in oral history goes back as far as Jolof&#x27;s.

Under Jolof hegemony, Cayor was ruled by a Great Lamane traditionally elected by the other Lamanes from the Fall family of Palene Ded, who claimed descend from Ousmane Boune Afal, a companion of Mohammed, by means of Wagadou. Every year this Great Lamane would lead a large delegation to Jolof to pay tribute to the &quot;Buurba&quot; there.

===Independence and Amary Ngone===
In 1549, the damel (&quot;dammeel&quot; in Wolof, often translated into European languages as &quot;king&quot;) Dece Fu Njogu, having failed to send tribute to the &quot;Buurba&quot; Léléfoulifak for several years, sent his son Amary Ngone Sobel Fall to do so. Amary, aided by his uncle the Teigne of Baol, led an army to a lake called Danki, and left them there to go to the &quot;Buurba&quot;&#x27;s court with a small escort. Poorly received by Léléfoulifak, he announced that his country had no need of a leader such as that. The Jolof-Jolof pursued them back to Danki, where the Cayor forces routed them and killed Léléfoulifak.

The battle of Danki marked the end of the Jolof Empire&#x27;s hold over Cayor. In the ensuing celebrations Dece Fu Njogu was killed in an accident, and Amary Ngone became damel. His uncle died soon afterwards, and he thus became the first Damel-Teigne ruling over both Cayor and Baol. He proclaimed a new constitution for the kingdom and founded a new, more centrally located capital at Mboul. In the years after his accession Jolof invaded several times attempting to re-assert their hegemony but were defeated. They would not dare to attack Cayor again until Amary&#x27;s death, after a 44-year reign.

===Marabout Wars===
During the height of the Tubenaan movement in the late 17th century, marabouts across the region began to aspire to political power for the first time, advocating a restoration of traditional Islamic values. Futa Toro was the first to fall. In Cayor, the powerful marabout Ndiaye Sall allied with Yacine Bubu, who had recently and controversially been removed from her position as lingeer by her nephew, the Damel Detye Maram. They joined forces to overthrow him, enthroning another nephew of Yacine Bubu&#x27;s, Ma Faly Gueye. Six months later, however, Gueye was caught drinking alcohol by Sall&#x27;s &quot;talibes&quot; and killed. Yacine Bubu, determined to protect the power of the royal family and prevent Sall from establishing a theocracy, convened a secret assembly of notables to reach out to Makhoredia Diouf, Buur of Saloum, for support against the marabouts. They were successful in defeating Sall, but instability continued for years afterwards.

In 1693 the aristocracy, now threatened by the Buur of Saloum, appealed to the Teigne of neighboring Baol, Lat Sukaabe Fall for help. He took over Cayor and declared himself the &quot;Damel-Teigne&quot;, imposing the hegemony of his maternal line, the Geej, over the previously dominant Dorobe and Guelwaar matriclans. He also strengthened central power, coopted the marabouts with royal appointments, and frequently clashed with the French over their attempts to impose a trade monopoly on the kingdom.

===18th Century===
During the 18th century, under the leadershup of Damel Maïsa Teindde Ouédji, Cayor annexed the Kingdom of Baol but was then embroiled in a succession dispute after his death. Baol regained its independence in 1756. During the 1750s and 60s, Cayor was repeatedly involved in wars against Waalo and Jolof, with the &quot;Buurba&quot; ruling as Damel 1759-60. The forces of the Trarza Emirate helped Maissa Bigué Ngoné Fall regain the throne, in return for yearly tribute and permission to raid in Cayor one month a year.

In 1776, inspired by the rise of the Imamate of Futa Toro, the marabouts of Cayor again began to agitate for political power under the leadership of Malamin Sarr. Damel Amari Ngoone Ndela Kumba pre-emptively attacked, capturing Sarr&#x27;s son and selling him into slavery. In response, some clerics did the same to agents of the crown. In a climactic showdown the marabouts were defeated, Sarr was killed, and many were again sold into slavery. The surviving marabouts played an important role in founding the Lebou republic on the Cap-Vert peninsula.

Soon after, the Almamy of Futa Toro Abdul Kader joined with the Buurba of Jolof to avenge the clerics and re-establish his influence over Cayor. As the invading army crossed the Ferlo Desert, the damel removed food stores and poisoned wells so that the exhausted Torodbe could not replenish their supplies. At the battle of Bunxoy, Amari Ngoone Ndela destroyed the Futanke force and captured Abdul Kader himself. He treated him well, as a respected religious leader, then sent him home laden with gifts after the Torodbe had elected a new almamy.

In the aftermath of this decisive victory of the old, secular order over reformist Islamists, tension continued to increase between the clerics and the nobility. During this period, contemporary writers began to refer to the ruling class as &#x27;pagan&#x27; for the first time, although they still self-identified as Muslim.

===Lat Jor and the French===

Birima Ngoné Latir was crowned &quot;damel&quot; in 1855, succeeding his uncle who had raised him after his father Makodou Koumba, the Teigne of Baol, had been driven into exile.

The French governor Louis Faidherbe, based in Saint-Louis, encouraged the clerics to rebel again. In 1859 the marabouts of the province of Ndiambour took advantage of the rumoured death of the young, weak &quot;damel&quot; to do so. Makodou Koumba returned from exile to help crush the rebellion. A brutal war resulted, with the reigning &quot;teigne&quot; Thié Yasin Ngoné Déguèn coming to support the marabouts with the promise of becoming &quot;damel&quot;. After winning battles at Mboul and Mekhe, and 2 years of conflict, Birima Ngoné Latir defeated the Baol-Baol army and Makodou Koumba was reinstalled as &quot;teigne&quot;. Latir died soon after, however, and Makodou left Baol to succeed his son as &quot;damel&quot;.

Makodou faced resistance from his son&#x27;s maternal side, who wanted Birima Ngoné&#x27;s half-brother Lat Jor enthroned instead. Makodou defeated the opposition at Béri-Ngaraf, and Lat Jor submitted. He reneged on a treaty signed with the French to build a railroad across Cayor, so in 1861 the French invaded and replaced him with Ma-Dyodyo. Lat Jor and the nobility resented both the harsh rule of Ma-Dyodyo and the external intervention. After some initial military success in 1863, he was forced to take refuge with the &quot;almaami&quot; of Saloum, Maba Diakhou Ba, early the next year. 

The French attempted to annex the country, but this ultimately proved unworkable. In 1868 Lat Jor and his troops returned to Cayor to regain independence. He allied with Shaikh Amadou Ba and defeated the French in the battle of Mekhe on July 8th, 1869. By 1871 the French accepted his restoration to the position of &quot;damel&quot;. Amadou Ba&#x27;s meddling in Cayor, however, soon ended their partnership. Over the next few years Lat Jor tried to exert his authority over Baol and helped the French defeat and kill Amadou in 1875.

This alliance was broken in 1881 when Lat Jor began a rebellion to resist the construction of the Dakar to Saint-Louis railway across Cayor. Dior is reported to have told the French Governor Servatius:

&quot;&quot;As long as I live, be assured, I shall oppose, with all my might the construction of this railway&quot;.&quot;

In 1883 Lat Jor tried to replace the powerful &quot;Farba&quot; Demba War Sall, who defected to Samba Laobe Fall, Lat Jor&#x27;s nephew and rival claimant to the throne. With French support, Samba soon took over Cayor. He ruled for 3 years, before quarreling with Alboury Ndiaye, &quot;Bourba&quot; of Jolof, and invading despite a treaty promising to inform the French before making war. Alboury attacked while Fall&#x27;s exhausted troops were trying to set up camp, routing the Waadjor forced and wounding Fall. The French pressured the &quot;damel&quot; to pay reparations, but he refused. At the ensuing negotiations at Tivaouane on October 6, 1886, a fight ensued and he was killed by a French lieutenant. Lat Jor died in battle soon afterwards, and the kingdom of Cayor ceased to exist as an independent, united state.

== Culture ==
Cayor society was highly stratified. The damel and nobles (&quot;Garmi&quot;) were at the top of the hierarchy followed by free men (including villagers and marabouts) who were known as &quot;Jambur&quot;. Below the &quot;Jambur&quot; were the &quot;Nyenoo&quot;, members of hereditary and endogamous castes such as metalworkers, tailors, griots, woodcarvers, etc. The lowest group of the hierarchy consisted of &quot;Dyaam&quot;, or slaves. Slaves were generally treated well and those that were owned by the kingdom often exercised military and political power, such as the &quot;Farba&quot; Demba War Sall.

The &quot;Tyeddo&quot; class were warriors generally recruited among the slaves of the &quot;damel&quot;. Fiercely opposed to the strict practice of Islam advocated by the marabouts, they were renowned drinkers, brave fighters, and inveterate raiders, including within Cayor. Their depredations went a long way to creating unrest and promoting Islam among the population. Cayor peasants tended to deliberately produce less food than they could, as wealth was an invitation to raiders; when colonial rule ended the raiding, food production and exports rose dramatically.

==Government==
In addition to Cayor, the &quot;damel&quot; also ruled over the Lebou area of Cap-Vert (where modern Dakar is), and they often ruled as the &quot;Teignes&quot; (rulers) of the neighboring kingdom of Baol. In 1445, Venetian traveler Alvise Cadamosto reported that the king&#x27;s entourage included Berber and Arab clerics. The Khali advised the king and was the official representation of the clerical class at the court. 

Traditionally the damel himself was not purely hereditary, but was designated by a 4-member council consisting of:
* the Jaurin Bul (&quot;Diawrine-Boul&quot;), hereditary chief of the Jambur (&quot;free men&quot;; French &quot;Diambour&quot;) and president of the council
* the Calau (&quot;Tchialaw&quot;), chief of the canton of Jambanyan (&quot;Diambagnane&quot;)
* the Botal (&quot;Bôtale&quot;), chief of the canton of Jop (&quot;Diop&quot;), and
* the Baje (&quot;Badgié&quot;), chief of the canton of Gateny (&quot;Gatègne&quot;).

The &quot;damel&quot; nominated several other important political positions. The lingeer was generally the oldest woman of the ruling matrilineage, frequently the king&#x27;s mother, sister, or cousin. Yacine Bubu&#x27;s replacement as lingeer by her younger sister was an important catalyst for her rebellion. She controlled her own army of slave soldiers and clients, and received the tax income of a province. The &quot;kangam&quot; were provincial governors and ministers. The &quot;dyambor&quot; served as viceroy, and was a &quot;garmi&quot; and close kin to the &quot;damel&quot;. Some villages were designated as being run by princesses called &quot;dye&quot;.

==Religion==
Trans-Saharan traders brought Islam to the region in the 8th century, and it rapidly became the dominant tradition among the Wolof, to the point where historians can find no traces of a pre-Islamic organized religion. The practice of Islam, however, was syncreticized with local customs in much the same way that Christianity was adapted to an underlying pagan context in Europe. This has led to debate among scholars, some of whom characterize the nobility of Cayor and other Senegambian kingdoms as &#x27;pagan&#x27; (despite their self-identification as Muslims) in opposition to a more stringently Muslim marabout class. Islam was the official religion of the state and of the entire population. When Christian missionaries asked the damel for permission to prosyletize in 1848, he refused, saying that as Muslims the Wajoor already knew God; he sent them to convert the Serer instead. 

Most of the marabouts in Cayor were Fulas from Futa Toro, but integrated into the Wolof population over time. There was a clear separation between the clerical and noble classes, although nobles and freemen could join the marabout class as &quot;talibe&quot; (disciples). Lat Jor&#x27;s acceptance of a marabout patron in Maba (sometimes referred to as his conversion to Islam) prompted a rapid shift away from more syncreticized Islamic practices among the inhabitants of Cayor generally.

<text>Snettisham is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is located near the west coast of Norfolk, some south of the seaside resort of Hunstanton, north of the town of King&#x27;s Lynn and northwest of the city of Norwich.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Snaet&#x27;s/Sneti&#x27;s homestead/village&#x27;.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 2374 in 1097 households. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk. The population of the civil parish had increased to 2,570 by 2011 and to 2710 by 2021.

Snettisham RSPB reserve, on the coast of The Wash some to the west of Snettisham village, is a nature reserve in the care of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It consists of bird lagoons and bird-observation hides, including a rotary hide. 

The Snettisham coast around the reserve is often said to be &quot;where Norfolk stares at Lincolnshire&quot;. This is because, unlike much of Norfolk&#x27;s coast where the sea stretches to the horizon, Snettisham looks across the square-mouthed estuary of The Wash at the county of Lincolnshire, only away. The River Ingol runs to the south of the village, upon which stands the early nineteenth-century Snettisham watermill, now renovated as a holiday let.

Though traces of the railway station and railway line can still be seen the service, which was opened in 1862, was terminated in 1969.

St Mary&#x27;s Church in the village has a high spire, a landmark for ships in The Wash. Nikolaus Pevsner called it &quot;perhaps the most exciting 14th century Decorated church in Norfolk&quot;. It served as the model for the later Christ Church Cathedral in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, built 1845–1853.

The Snettisham Hoard is a series of discoveries of Iron Age precious metal, including nearly 180 gold torcs, 75 complete and the rest fragmentary, found in the area between 1948 and 1973 at Wild Ken Hill. In 1985 there was also a find of Romano-British jewellery and raw materials buried in a clay pot in AD 155, the Snettisham Jeweller&#x27;s Hoard. Although this latter find has no direct connection with the nearby Iron Age finds, it may be evidence of a long tradition of gold- and silver-working in the area.

Snettisham has a complex entry in Domesday Book of 1086, where it is divided in ownership between William de Warenne and the Bishop of Bayeux. Related are West Newton and Castle Rising and Weston Longville is said to be in Snettisham&#x27;s valuation. The name of the manor is spelt in four different ways, two very similar to the present pronunciation, one of &quot;Snesham&quot; and one of &quot;Nestesham&quot;.

In 2024 Snettisham received national attention on account of its feral chicken population. Residents reportedly had mixed views about the birds.

An electoral ward of the same name exists and had a population of 4,032 at the 2011 Census.

<doc id="100450" wikidata="Q1714823" url="?curid=100450" title="Smoothsort">
<text>In computer science, smoothsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. A variant of heapsort, it was invented and published by Edsger Dijkstra in 1981. Like heapsort, smoothsort is an in-place algorithm with an upper bound of operations (see big O notation), but it is not a stable sort. The advantage of smoothsort is that it comes closer to time if the input is already sorted to some degree, whereas heapsort averages regardless of the initial sorted state.

==Overview==
Like heapsort, smoothsort organizes the input into a priority queue and then repeatedly extracts the maximum. Also like heapsort, the priority queue is an implicit heap data structure (a heap-ordered implicit binary tree), which occupies a prefix of the array. Each extraction shrinks the prefix and adds the extracted element to a growing sorted suffix. When the prefix has shrunk to nothing, the array is completely sorted.

Heapsort maps the binary tree to the array using a top-down breadth-first traversal of the tree; the array begins with the root of the tree, then its two children, then four grandchildren, and so on. Every element has a well-defined depth below the root of the tree, and every element except the root has its parent earlier in the array. Its height above the leaves, however, depends on the size of the array. This has the disadvantage that every element must be moved as part of the sorting process: it must pass through the root before being moved to its final location.

Smoothsort uses a different mapping, a bottom-up depth-first post-order traversal. A left child is followed by the subtree rooted at its sibling, and a right child is followed by its parent. Every element has a well-defined height above the leaves, and every non-leaf element has its &quot;children&quot; earlier in the array. Its depth below the root, however, depends on the size of the array. The algorithm is organized so the root is at the end of the heap, and at the moment that an element is extracted from the heap it is already in its final location and does not need to be moved. Also, a sorted array is already a valid heap, and many sorted intervals are valid heap-ordered subtrees.

More formally, every position is the root of a unique subtree, whose nodes occupy a contiguous interval that ends at . An initial prefix of the array (including the whole array), might be such an interval corresponding to a subtree, but in general decomposes as a union of a number of successive such subtree intervals, which Dijkstra calls &quot;stretches&quot;. Any subtree without a parent (i.e. rooted at a position whose parent lies beyond the prefix under consideration) gives a stretch in the decomposition of that interval, which decomposition is therefore unique. When a new node is appended to the prefix, one of two cases occurs: either the position is a leaf and adds a stretch of length 1 to the decomposition, or it combines with the last two stretches, becoming the parent of their respective roots, thus replacing the two stretches by a new stretch containing their union plus the new (root) position.

Dijkstra noted that the obvious rule would be to combine stretches if and only if they have equal size, in which case all subtrees would be perfect binary trees of size . However, he chose a different rule, which gives more possible tree sizes. This has the same asymptotic efficiency, but gains a small constant factor in efficiency by requiring fewer stretches to cover each interval.

The rule Dijkstra uses is that the last two stretches are combined if and only if their sizes are consecutive Leonardo numbers and (in that order), which numbers are recursively defined, in a manner very similar to the Fibonacci numbers, as:
* 
As a consequence, the size of any subtree is a Leonardo number. The sequence of stretch sizes decomposing the first positions, for any , can be found in a greedy manner: the first size is the largest Leonardo number not exceeding , and the remainder (if any) is decomposed recursively. The sizes of stretches are decreasing, strictly so except possibly for two final sizes 1, and avoiding successive Leonardo numbers except possibly for the final two sizes.

In addition to each stretch being a heap-ordered tree, the roots of the trees are maintained in sorted order. This effectively adds a third child (which Dijkstra calls a &quot;stepson&quot;) to each root linking it to the preceding root. This combines all of the trees together into one global heap. with the global maximum at the end.

Although the location of each node&#x27;s stepson is fixed, the link only exists for tree roots, meaning that links are removed whenever trees are merged. This is different from ordinary children, which are linked as long as the parent exists.

In the first (heap growing) phase of sorting, an increasingly large initial part of the array is reorganized so that the subtree for each of its stretches is a max-heap: the entry at any non-leaf position is at least as large as the entries at the positions that are its children. In addition, all roots are at least as large as their stepsons.

In the second (heap shrinking) phase, the maximal node is detached from the end of the array (without needing to move it) and the heap invariants are re-established among its children. (Specifically, among the newly created stepsons.)

Practical implementation frequently needs to compute Leonardo numbers . Dijkstra provides clever code which uses a fixed number of integer variables to efficiently compute the values needed at the time they are needed. Alternatively, if there is a finite bound on the size of arrays to be sorted, a precomputed table of Leonardo numbers can be stored in space.

==Operations==
While the two phases of the sorting procedure are opposite to each other as far as the evolution of the sequence-of-heaps structure is concerned, they are implemented using one core primitive, equivalent to the 
&quot;sift down&quot; operation in a binary max-heap.

===Sifting down===
The core sift-down operation (which Dijkstra calls &quot;&quot;) restores the heap invariant when it is possibly violated only at the root node. If the root node is less than any of its children, it is swapped with its greatest child and the process repeated with the root node in its new subtree.

The difference between smoothsort and a binary max-heap is that the root of each stretch must be ordered with respect to a third &quot;stepson&quot;: the root of the preceding stretch. So the sift-down procedure starts with a series of four-way comparisons (the root node and three children) until the stepson is not the maximal element, then a series of three-way comparisons (the root plus two children) until the root node finds its final home and the invariants are re-established.

Each tree is a full binary tree: each node has two children or none. There is no need to deal with the special case of one child which occurs in a standard implicit binary heap. (But the special case of stepson links more than makes up for this saving.)

Because there are stretches, each of which is a tree of depth , the time to perform each sifting-down operation is bounded by .

===Growing the heap region by incorporating an element to the right===
When an additional element is considered for incorporation into the sequence of stretches (list of disjoint heap structures) it either forms a new one-element stretch, or it combines the two rightmost stretches by becoming the parent of both their roots and forming a new stretch that replaces the two in the sequence. Which of the two happens depends only on the sizes of the stretches currently present (and ultimately only on the index of the element added); Dijkstra stipulated that stretches are combined if and only if their sizes are and for some , i.e., consecutive Leonardo numbers; the new stretch will have size .

In either case, the new element must be sifted down to its correct place in the heap structure. Even if the new node is a one-element stretch, it must still be sorted relative to the preceding stretch&#x27;s root.

====Optimization====
Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm saves work by observing that the full heap invariant is required at the end of the growing phase, but it is not required at every intermediate step. In particular, the requirement that an element be greater than its stepson is only important for the elements which are the final tree roots.

Therefore, when an element is added, compute the position of its future parent. If this is within the range of remaining values to be sorted, act as if there is no stepson and only sift down within the current tree.

===Shrinking the heap region by separating the rightmost element from it===
During this phase, the form of the sequence of stretches goes through the changes of the growing phase in reverse. No work at all is needed when separating off a leaf node, but for a non-leaf node its two children become roots of new stretches, and need to be moved to their proper place in the sequence of roots of stretches. This can be obtained by applying sift-down twice: first for the left child, and then for the right child (whose stepson was the left child).

Because half of all nodes in a full binary tree are leaves, this performs an average of one sift-down operation per node.

====Optimization====
It is already known that the newly exposed roots are correctly ordered with respect to their normal children; it is only the ordering relative to their stepsons which is in question. Therefore, while shrinking the heap, the first step of sifting down can be simplified to a single comparison with the stepson. If a swap occurs, subsequent steps must do the full four-way comparison.

==Analysis==
Smoothsort takes time to process a presorted array, in the worst case, and achieves nearly linear performance on many nearly sorted inputs. However, it does not handle all nearly sorted sequences optimally. Using the count of inversions as a measure of un-sortedness (the number of pairs of indices and with and ; for randomly sorted input this is approximately ), there are possible input sequences with inversions which cause it to take time, whereas other adaptive sorting algorithms can solve these cases in time.

The smoothsort algorithm needs to be able to hold in memory the sizes of all of the trees in the Leonardo heap. Since they are sorted by order and all orders are distinct, this is usually done using a bit vector indicating which orders are present. Moreover, since the largest order is at most , these bits can be encoded in machine words, assuming a transdichotomous machine model.

Note that machine words is not the same thing as &quot;one&quot; machine word. A 32-bit vector would only suffice for sizes less than . A 64-bit vector will do for sizes less than . In general, it takes bits of vector per bit of size.

==Poplar sort==
A simpler algorithm inspired by smoothsort is poplar sort. Named after the rows of trees of decreasing size often seen in Dutch polders, it performs fewer comparisons than smoothsort for inputs that are not mostly sorted, but cannot achieve linear time for sorted inputs.

The significant change made by poplar sort in that the roots of the various trees are &quot;not&quot; kept in sorted order; there are no &quot;stepson&quot; links tying them together into a single heap. Instead, each time the heap is shrunk in the second phase, the roots are searched to find the maximum entry.

Because there are shrinking steps, each of which must search tree roots for the maximum, the best-case run time for poplar sort is .

The authors also suggest using perfect binary trees rather than Leonardo trees to provide further simplification, but this is a less significant change.

The same structure has been proposed as a general-purpose priority queue under the name post-order heap, achieving amortized insertion time in a structure simpler than an implicit binomial heap.

==Applications==
The musl C library uses smoothsort for its implementation of codice_1.

<doc id="100455" wikidata="Q1463998" url="?curid=100455" title="The Wash">
<text>The Wash is a shallow natural rectangular bay and multiple estuary on the east coast of England in the United Kingdom. It is an inlet of the North Sea and is the largest multiple estuary system in the UK, as well as being the largest natural bay in England and is the outflow for the rivers Witham, Welland, Nene and the Great Ouse. It is also one of the most important places of conservation in Europe, with several nature reserves located within this area.

The coastline is partly in Lincolnshire and partly in Norfolk. The Lincolnshire side forms part of the only coastline of the East Midlands region whilst the Norfolk side forms the north-west corner of the East Anglian region. The coastline stretches from Gibraltar Point just south of the seaside town of Skegness to Gore Point near the village of Holme-next-the-Sea, just east of the seaside town of Hunstanton in Norfolk. These two points are over from each other by road, but only by sea.

The bay is made up of multiple estuaries, marshland, deep water channels (in particular the Boston and Lynn Deeps), shifting shallow water channels which are all surrounded by multiple sandbanks.

There are several large settlements near its coastline, the largest is the town of King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk followed by the two slightly smaller towns of Boston in Lincolnshire and Wisbech in Cambridgeshire. These are the three main inland ports in the Wash area; a fourth smaller port is also available for shipping on the River Nene at Sutton Bridge and a small marina for pleasure craft is also accessible on the tidal River Welland at Fosdyke Bridge. Nearby, on either side of the Wash at almost opposite ends to each other, are the seaside towns of Skegness which is located on the top of the Lincolnshire side just north of Gibraltar Point and Hunstanton on the top of the Norfolk side north of the nearby royal estate of Sandringham.

==Geography==
 The Wash makes a large indentation in the coastline of Eastern England that separates Lincolnshire from the curved coast of East Anglia. It is a large bay with three roughly straight sides meeting at right angles, each about in length.

The western coast, which is roughly parallel to the east coast, runs from Gibraltar Point to the mouth of the River Welland just north east of the village of Fosdyke, and is entirely within Lincolnshire. The southern coast from Fosdyke to King&#x27;s Lynn runs roughly north-west to south-east, connecting these two river mouths, and is punctuated by the mouth of a third river, the River Nene, which flows into the Wash just north of Sutton Bridge with the county boundary between Lincolnshire and Norfolk (which is also the regional boundary between the East Midlands and the East of England) meeting just beyond this point before it continues eastwards to Ongar Hill where it meets the mouth of the River Great Ouse.

The eastern coast of the Wash is entirely within Norfolk, and initially extends from the mouth of the River Great Ouse just north of the town of King&#x27;s Lynn north eastwards towards the small village of Wolferton close to the Sandringham estate before heading northwards from Snettisham to the low lands of Heacham, the town of Hunstanton, and the village of Old Hunstanton, before reaching its northern extremity at Gore Point near Holme-next-the-Sea, where the Norfolk coast turns eastwards.

Inland from the Wash the land is flat, low-lying and often marshy: these are the Fens of Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk.

Deposits of sediment and land reclamation have altered the coastline of the Wash markedly in historical times. Several towns once on the coast of the Wash (notably King&#x27;s Lynn) are now some distance inland. Much of the Wash itself is very shallow, with several large sandbanks, such as Breast Sand, Bulldog Sand, Roger Sand and Old South Sand, which are exposed at low tide, especially along the south coast. These form hazards to navigation.

Three commercial shipping lane channels lead inland from the Wash:
*the River Nene leading to Port Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire and further inland to the Port of Wisbech in Cambridgeshire,
*the River Great Ouse leading to King&#x27;s Lynn Docks in Norfolk,

both via the large channel known as the Lynn Deeps.
* The third shipping lane can accessed via the narrower Boston Deeps channel to lead inland, via The Haven (River Witham) to the Port of Boston.

Each of the three shipping lanes has maritime pilot stations to guide and navigate incoming and outgoing cargo ships. Large boats can now only access the River Welland as far as Fosdyke Bridge since the replacement of the old swing bridge which carries the A17 road over the river with a fixed bridge in 1990 following the decline of Spalding as a port during the first part of the 20th century leaving only very small craft being able to use this route.

A re-survey of the coastline of the Wash carried out by the Ordnance Survey in 2011 revealed that an estimated additional on its coastline had been created by accretion since previous surveys between 1960 and 1980.

==Water temperature==

The Wash varies enormously in water temperature throughout the year. Winter temperatures are brought near freezing by the cold North Sea flows. Summer water temperatures can reach after prolonged high ambient air temperature and sun. This effect, which typically happens in the shallow areas around beaches and often only in pockets of water, is exaggerated by the large sheltered tidal reach.

==Wildlife==
The Wash is made up of extensive salt marshes, major inter-tidal banks of sand and mud, shallow waters and deep channels. As understanding of the importance of the natural marshes has increased in the 21st century, the seawall at Freiston has been breached in three places to increase the salt-marsh area and provide extra habitat for birds, particularly waders, and as a natural flood-prevention measure. The extensive creeks in the salt marsh and the vegetation that grows there help to dissipate wave energy, so enhancing the protection afforded to land behind the salt marsh. This is an example of the recent exploration of the possibilities of sustainable coastal management by adopting soft engineering techniques, rather than with dykes and drainage. The same scheme includes new brackish lagoon habitat.
On the eastern side of the Wash, low chalk cliffs, with a noted stratum of red chalk, are found at Hunstanton. The gravel pits (lagoons) found at Snettisham RSPB reserve are an important roost for waders at high tide. This Special Protection Area (SPA) borders onto the North Norfolk Coast Special Protection Area. To the north-west, the Wash extends to Gibraltar Point, another SPA.

The partly confined nature of the Wash habitats, combined with ample tidal flows, allows shellfish to breed, especially shrimp, cockles and mussels. Some water birds such as oystercatchers feed on shellfish. It is also a breeding area for common tern, and a feeding area for marsh harriers. Migrating birds such as geese, duck and wading birds come to the Wash in large numbers to spend the winter, with an average total of around 400,000 birds present at any one time. It has been estimated that some two million birds a year use the Wash for feeding and roosting during their annual migrations.

The Wash is recognised as being internationally important for 17 species of bird. They include pink-footed goose, dark-bellied brent goose, shelduck, pintail, oystercatcher, ringed plover, grey plover, golden plover, lapwing, knot, sanderling, dunlin, black-tailed godwit, bar-tailed godwit, curlew, redshank and turnstone.

At the end of the latest glaciation, and while the sea level remained lower than it is today, the rivers Witham, Welland, Glen, Nene and Great Ouse joined into a large river.

The deep valley of the Wash was formed, not by an interglacial river, but by ice of the Wolstonian and Devensian stages flowing southwards up the slope represented by the modern coast and forming tunnel valleys, of which the Silver Pit is one of many. This process gave the Silver Pit its depth and narrowness. When the tunnel valley was free of ice and seawater, it was occupied by the river. This kept it free of sediment, unlike most tunnel valleys. Since the sea flooded it, the valley seems to have been kept open by tidal action. During the Ipswichian Stage, the Wash River probably flowed by way of the site of the Silver Pit, but the tunnel valley would not have been formed at this stage, as its alignment seems inconsistent.

In Roman Britain, embankments were built around the Wash&#x27;s margins to protect agricultural land from flooding. However, they fell into disrepair after the Roman withdrawal in 407 CE.

From 865 to about 1066, the Wash was used by the Vikings as a major route to invade East Anglia and Middle England. Danes established themselves in Cambridge in 875. Before the 12th century, when drainage and embankment efforts led by monks began to separate the land from the estuarine mudflats, the Wash was a tidal part of the Fens that reached as far as Cambridge and Peterborough.

Local people put up fierce resistance against the Normans for some time after the 1066 Conquest.

The name Wash may have been derived from Old English &quot;wāse&quot; meaning mud, slime or ooze. The word &quot;Wasche&quot; is mentioned in the popular dictionary &quot;Promptorium parvulorum&quot; of about 1440 as a water or a ford (&quot;vadum&quot;). A chronicle states that King Edward VI passed &quot;the Wasshes&quot; as he visited the town of King&#x27;s Lynn in 1548. By then, documents began to refer to the &quot;Waashe&quot; or &quot;Wysche&quot;, but only for the tidal sands and shoals of the rivers Welland and Nene. Sixteenth-century scholars identified the Wash as the &quot;Æstuarium Metuonis&quot; (&quot;The Reaping/Mowing/Cutting-Off Estuary&quot;) mentioned by Ptolemy in Roman times. They claimed the word was still in occasional use. William Camden characterized &quot;The Washes&quot; as &quot;a very large arme&quot; of the &quot;German Ocean&quot; (the North Sea), &quot;at every tide and high sea covered all with water, but when the sea ebbeth, and the tide is past, a man may pass over it as on dry land, but yet not without danger&quot;, as King John learned not without his loss (see below). Inspired by Camden&#x27;s account, William Shakespeare mentioned the &quot;Lincolne-Washes&quot; in his stage play &quot;King John&quot; (1616). During the 17th and 18th centuries the name Wash came to be used for the estuary itself.

Drainage and reclamation works around the Wash continued until the 1970s. Large areas of salt marsh were progressively enclosed by banks and converted to agricultural land. The Wash is now surrounded by artificial sea defences on all three landward sides. In the 1970s, two large circular banks were built in the Terrington Marsh area of the Wash, as part of an abortive attempt to turn the entire estuary into a fresh water reservoir. The plan failed, not least because the banks were built using mud dredged from the salt marsh, which salinated fresh water stored there.

===Hanseatic League===
From 13th century the market town and seaport of Bishop&#x27;s Lynn became the first member trading depot (&quot;Kontor&quot;) in the Kingdom of England of the Hanseatic League of ports. During the 14th century, Lynn ranked as the most important port in England, when sea trade with Europe was dominated by the League. It still retains two medieval Hanseatic League warehouses: Hanse House built in 1475 and Marriott&#x27;s Warehouse.

===King John and his jewellery===
King John of England is said to have lost some of his jewels at the Wash in 1216. According to contemporary reports, John travelled from Spalding, Lincolnshire, to Bishop&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, but was taken ill and decided to return. While he took the longer route by way of Wisbech, he sent his baggage train, comprising horse-drawn wagons, along the causeway and ford across the mouth of the Wellstream, a route usable only at low tide. The wagons moved too slowly to escape the incoming tide and many were lost. However, the treasure hunter and researcher Alan Marshall has proven from data supplied him by the Royal Greenwich Observatory and by the Bidston Observatory in Birkenhead that the tide had actually been going out, and by further studying the lay of the now reclaimed land, he ascertained that the cause had been a reverse tidal surge, whereby the outgoing tide suddenly sped up at a certain point. However, scholars cannot agree on whether the king&#x27;s jewels were in the baggage train, and there is evidence that his regalia were intact after the journey.
The accident was said to have occurred somewhere near Sutton Bridge on the River Nene.

John may have left his jewels in Lynn as security for a loan and arranged for their &quot;loss&quot;. But that is considered an apocryphal account. He was recorded as staying the following night, 12–13 October 1216, at Swineshead Abbey, moving on to Newark-on-Trent, and dying of his illness on 19 October.

===River and town names===
The name of the river changed as a result of redirection of the Great Ouse in the 17th century.

Bishop&#x27;s Lynn was renamed as King&#x27;s Lynn in the 16th century as a result of King Henry VIII&#x27;s establishment of the Church of England.

==Air weapons training range==
A Ministry of Defence weapons Range Danger Area lies along a small region of the Wash coastline, reserved for Royal Air Force, Army Air Corps and NATO-allied bombing and air weapons training. RAF Holbeach, active since 1926, was historically originally part of the former RAF Sutton Bridge station. Another air-weapons training range located on the Wash – RAF Wainfleet, operating from 1938, was decommissioned in 2010.

==Local tradition==
Sailing from out of the South Lincolnshire Fens into the Wash, especially for shell-fishing, is traditionally known locally as &quot;going down below&quot;. The origin of the phrase is unclear.

==Water channels etc==
The bay is made up of multiple estuaries, marshland, deep water channels (in particular the Boston and Lynn Deeps), and shifting shallow water channels which are all surrounded by multiple sandbanks. Due to these features, it is claimed to be one of the most challenging and hazardous places for sea navigation in the world. It is fed by the rivers Witham, Welland, Nene and Great Ouse. It is a 620 km2 (240 sq. mi.) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is also a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I, a National Nature Reserve, a Ramsar site, a Special Area of Conservation and a Special Protection Area. It is in the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and part of it is the Snettisham Royal Society for the Protection of Birds nature reserve.

==Landmarks==
The four most distinctive man-made landmarks that can be seen from the bay are:

* St Botolph&#x27;s Church in Boston, the parish church of Boston is the most famous landmark to be seen in the bay. It has a tower known as the Boston Stump. This can be seen on clear days right across the bay and from the Norfolk side of the Wash particularly from Hunstanton. This dates from the 16th century and was often used by local fishermen as a navigation marker.
* The Grain Storage Tower in King&#x27;s Lynn docks.
* Less prominently but particularly from the Norfolk side of the bay, Sutton Bridge Power Station
* The former lighthouse at Old Hunstanton can also seen from parts of the bay from the Lincolnshire side of the bay on clear days particularly from Skegness and also from Gibraltar Point.

The Outer Trial Bank, a remnant of a 1970s experiment, lies some off the Lincolnshire coast near the mouth of the River Nene.

The most notable nature feature is Hunstanton Cliffs, comprising strata of orange, red and white chalk.

==Proposed racetrack==
In 1934 a proposal was made, supported by racing driver Malcolm Campbell, to build a race track on reclaimed land from Boston to Gibraltar Point, near Skegness. It would have been used as a road to Skegness when there was no racing. There was also to be a long lake for boat racing inside the track loop. The financial straits in the 1930s prevented the project from proceeding.

<doc id="100456" wikidata="Q271889" url="?curid=100456" title="Kenneth Clarke">
<text>Kenneth Harry Clarke, Baron Clarke of Nottingham (born 2 July 1940) is a British politician who served as Home Secretary from 1992 to 1993 and Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1993 to 1997. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Rushcliffe from 1970 to 2019, serving as Father of the House of Commons between 2017 and 2019. 

Clarke served in the Cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and John Major as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1987 to 1988, Health Secretary from 1988 to 1990, and Education Secretary from 1990 to 1992. He held two of the Great Offices of State as Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer. 

President of the Tory Reform Group since 1997, Clarke is a one-nation conservative who identifies with economically and socially liberal views. He contested the Conservative Party leadership three times—in 1997, 2001 and 2005—being defeated each time. Opinion polls indicated he was more popular with the general public than with his party, whose generally Eurosceptic stance did not chime with his pro-European views. 

Under the coalition government of David Cameron, he returned to the Cabinet as Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor from 2010 to 2012 and Minister without Portfolio from 2012 to 2014. He was also the United Kingdom Anti-Corruption Champion from 2010 to 2014.

The Conservative Whip was withdrawn from him in September 2019 because he and 20 other MPs voted with the Opposition on a motion; for the remainder of his time in Parliament he sat as an independent, though still on the government benches. He stood down as an MP at the 2019 general election and was thereafter made a Conservative life peer in the House of Lords in 2020.

Clarke is President of the Conservative Europe Group, Co-President of the pro-EU body British Influence and Vice-President of the European Movement UK. Described by the press as a &#x27;Big Beast&#x27; of British politics, his total time as a minister is the fifth-longest in the modern era. He has spent over 20 years serving under Prime Ministers Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron. He was one of only five ministers (Tony Newton, Malcolm Rifkind, Patrick Mayhew and Lynda Chalker are the others) to serve throughout the whole 18 years of the Thatcher-Major governments, which represents the longest uninterrupted ministerial service in Britain since Lord Palmerston in the early 19th century.

==Early life and education==
Clarke was born at Langley Mill, Derbyshire, and was christened with the same name as his father, Kenneth Clarke, a Nottinghamshire mining electrician. The younger Clarke won a scholarship to the independent Nottingham High School before going up to read law at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated with an upper second honours degree. Clarke initially held Labour sympathies, and his grandfather was a Communist, but while at Cambridge he joined the Conservative Party.

As Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association (CUCA), Clarke invited former British Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley to speak for two years in succession, prompting some Jewish students (including his future successor at the Home Office, Michael Howard) to resign from CUCA in protest. Howard then defeated Clarke in one election for the presidency of the Cambridge Union, but Clarke became President of the Cambridge Union a year later, being elected on 6 March 1963 by a majority of 56 votes. Clarke opposed the admission of women to the Union, and is quoted as saying upon his election, &quot;The fact that Oxford has admitted them does not impress me at all. Cambridge should wait a year to see what happens before any decision is taken on admitting them.&quot;

In an early-1990s documentary, journalist Michael Cockerell played to Clarke some tape recordings of him speaking at the Cambridge Union as an undergraduate, and he displayed amusement at hearing his then-stereotypical upper class accent. Clarke is deemed one of the Cambridge Mafia, a group of prominent Conservative politicians who were educated at Cambridge in the 1960s. After graduation, Clarke was called to the Bar in 1963 at Gray&#x27;s Inn, being appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1980.

==Parliamentary career==
Clarke sought election to the House of Commons almost immediately after Cambridge. His political career began by contesting the Labour stronghold of Mansfield at the 1964 and 1966 elections. In June 1970, just before his 30th birthday, he won the East Midlands constituency of Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, south of Nottingham, from Labour MP Tony Gardner. 

Clarke was soon appointed a Government Whip, and served as such from 1972 to 1974; he, with the assistance of Labour rebels, helped ensure Edward Heath&#x27;s government won key votes on British entry into the European Communities (which later evolved into the European Union). Even though Clarke opposed the election of Margaret Thatcher as Conservative Party Leader in 1975, he was appointed as her Industry Spokesman from 1976 to 1979, and then occupied a range of ministerial positions during her premiership.

From 2017 to 2019 he served as Father of the House. Following his expulsion from the Conservative Party in September 2019, he became the first Independent MP to hold the position of Father of the House since Clement Tudway, who died in office as MP for Wells in 1815.

Lord Clarke is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by Parliament.

=== Early ministerial positions ===
Clarke first served in the government of Margaret Thatcher as Parliamentary secretary for Transport (1979–81) and Parliamentary under-secretary of state for Transport (1981–82), and then Minister of State for Health (1982–85).

Clarke joined the Cabinet as Paymaster General and Employment Minister (1985–87) (his Secretary of State, Lord Young of Graffham, sat in the Lords), and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of the DTI (1987–88) with responsibility for Inner Cities. While in that position, Clarke announced the sale to British Aerospace of the Rover Group, a new name for British Leyland, which had been nationalised in 1975 by the government of Harold Wilson.

=== Health Secretary (and aftermath) ===
Clarke was appointed the first Secretary of State for Health when the department was created out of the former Department of Health and Social Security in July 1988. Clarke, with backing from John Major, persuaded Thatcher to accept the controversial &quot;internal market&quot; concept to the NHS. Clarke claimed that he had persuaded Thatcher to introduce internal competition in the NHS as an alternative to her preference for introducing a system of compulsory health insurance, which he opposed.

He told his biographer Malcolm Balen: &quot;John Moore was pursuing a line which Margaret [Thatcher] was very keen on, which made everything compulsory medical insurance. I was bitterly opposed to that...The American system is...the world&#x27;s worst health service – expensive, inadequate and with a lot of rich doctors&quot;. In her memoirs, Thatcher claimed that Clarke, although &quot;a firm believer in state provision&quot;, was &quot;an extremely effective Health minister – tough in dealing with vested interests and trade unions, direct and persuasive in his exposition of government policy&quot;.

In January 1989, Clarke&#x27;s White Paper &quot;Working for Patients&quot; appeared; this advocated giving hospitals the right to become self-governing NHS Trusts, taxpayer-funded but with control over their budgets and independent of the regional health authorities. It also proposed that doctors be given the option to become &quot;GP fundholders&quot;. This would grant doctors control of their own budgets in the belief that they would purchase the most effective services for their patients. Instead of doctors automatically sending patients to the nearest hospital, they would be able to choose where they were treated. In this way, money would follow the patient and the most efficient hospitals would receive the greatest funding.

This was not well received by doctors and their trade union, the British Medical Association, launched a poster campaign against Clarke&#x27;s reforms, claiming that the NHS was &quot;underfunded, undermined and under threat&quot;. They also called the new GP contracts &quot;Stalinist&quot;. A March 1990 opinion poll commissioned by the BMA showed that 73% believed that the NHS was not safe in Conservative hands. Clarke later claimed that the BMA was &quot;the most unscrupulous trade union I have ever dealt with and I&#x27;ve dealt with every trade union across the board&quot;. Although Thatcher tried to halt the reforms just before they were introduced, Clarke successfully argued that they were necessary to demonstrate the government&#x27;s commitment to the NHS. Thatcher told Clarke: &quot;It is &quot;you&quot; I&#x27;m holding responsible if &quot;my&quot; NHS reforms don&#x27;t work&quot;.

By 1994 almost all hospitals had opted to become trusts but GP fundholding was much less popular. There were allegations that fundholders received more funding than non-fundholders, creating a two-tier system. GP fundholding was abolished by Labour in 1997 and replaced by Primary Care Groups. According to John Campbell, by &quot;the mid-1990s the NHS was treating more patients, more efficiently than in the 1980s...the system was arguably better managed and more accountable than before&quot;. Studies suggest that while the competition introduced in the &quot;internal market&quot; system resulted in shorter waiting times it also caused a reduction in the quality of care for patients.

Clarke has been the subject of criticism over the decades for his responsibility for the contaminated blood scandal. It was the largest loss-of-life disaster in Britain since the 1950s and claimed the lives of thousands of haemophiliacs. Theresa May ordered a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal in July 2017. In July 2021, Clarke gave oral evidence to the inquiry with his demeanour being widely branded &quot;arrogant, pompous and contemptuous&quot; by the press. It was reported that he argued with inquiry counsel, refused to apologise and at one point even walked out while the chairman, Sir Brian Langstaff, was speaking.

The MSF trade union claimed that Clarke&#x27;s exclusion of NHS medical laboratory staff from the pay review body in 1984 led to massive staff shortages and a crisis in medical laboratory testing by 1999.

=== Later ministerial positions ===
Just over two years later he was appointed Secretary of State for Education and Science in the final weeks of Thatcher&#x27;s Government, following Norman Tebbit&#x27;s unwillingness to return to Cabinet following the resignation of Geoffrey Howe. Clarke was the first Cabinet Minister to advise Thatcher to resign after her victory in the first round of the November 1990 leadership contest was less than the 15% winning margin required to prevent a second ballot; she referred to him in her memoirs as a &quot;candid friend&quot;: &quot;his manner was robust in the brutalist style he has cultivated: the candid friend&quot;.

Clarke came to work with John Major very closely, and quickly emerged as a central figure in his government. After continuing as Education Secretary (1990–92), where he introduced a number of reforms, he was appointed as Home Secretary in the wake of the Conservatives&#x27; victory at the 1992 general election. In May 1993, seven months after the impact of &quot;Black Wednesday&quot; had damaged Norman Lamont&#x27;s credibility as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Major sacked Lamont and appointed Clarke in his place.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
At first, Clarke was seen as the dominant figure in Cabinet, and at the October 1993 Conservative Party Conference he defended Major from his critics by pronouncing &quot;any enemy of John Major is an enemy of mine.&quot;

In the party leadership contest of 1995, when John Major beat John Redwood, Clarke kept faith in Major and commented: &quot;I don&#x27;t think the Conservative Party could win an election in 1,000 years on this ultra right-wing programme&quot;.

Clarke enjoyed an increasingly successful record as Chancellor, as the economy recovered from the recession of the early 1990s and a new monetary policy was put into effect after Black Wednesday. He reduced the basic rate of income tax from 25% to 23%, reduced UK Government spending as a percentage of GDP, and reduced the budget deficit from £50.8 billion in 1993 to £15.5 billion in 1997. Clarke&#x27;s successor, the Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown, continued these policies, which eliminated the deficit by 1998 and allowed Brown to record a budget surplus for the following four years. Interest rates, inflation and unemployment all fell during Clarke&#x27;s tenure at HM Treasury. Clarke&#x27;s success was such that Brown felt he had to pledge to keep to Clarke&#x27;s spending plans and these limits remained in place for the first two years of the Labour Government that was elected in 1997.

===Single Currency: free-hand and referendum pledge===
The matter of a referendum on Britain joining the planned euro – first raised by Margaret Thatcher in 1990 – was, after much press speculation, raised again at Cabinet by Douglas Hogg in the spring of 1996, very likely (in Clarke&#x27;s view) with Major&#x27;s approval; Clarke records that Heseltine spoke &quot;with passionate intensity&quot; at Cabinet against a referendum, believing both that referendums were pernicious and that no concession would be enough to please the Eurosceptics. Clarke, who had already threatened resignation over the issue, also opposed the measure and, although Clarke and Heseltine were in a small minority in Cabinet, Major once again deferred a decision.

Major, Heseltine and Clarke eventually reached agreement in April 1996, in what Clarke describes as &quot;a tense meeting ... rather like a treaty session&quot;, that there would be a commitment to a referendum before joining the euro, but that the pledge would be valid for one Parliament only (i.e. until the general election after next), with the Government&#x27;s long-term options remaining completely open; Clarke threatened to resign if this formula were departed from.

Clarke, writing in 2016 after the Brexit Referendum, comments that he and Heseltine later agreed that they had separately decided to give way because of the pressure Major was under, and that the referendum pledge &quot;was the biggest single mistake&quot; of their careers, giving &quot;legitimacy&quot; to such a device.

In December 1996, after Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind had commented that it was unlikely that the government would join the euro, Clarke and Heseltine took to the airwaves – in apparent unison – to insist that the government retained a free choice as to whether or not to join, angering Eurosceptics. When Tory Party Chairman, Brian Mawhinney, was understood to have briefed against him, Clarke declared: &quot;tell your kids to get their scooters off my lawn&quot; – an allusion to Harold Wilson&#x27;s rebuke of Trades Union leader Hugh Scanlon in the late 1960s.

===Role as a backbencher===
After the Conservatives entered opposition in 1997, Clarke contested the leadership of the Party for the first time. In 1997, the electorate being solely Tory Members of Parliament, he topped the poll in the first and second rounds. In the third and final round he formed an alliance with Eurosceptic John Redwood, who would have become Shadow Chancellor and Clarke&#x27;s deputy, were he to have won the contest. However, Thatcher endorsed Clarke&#x27;s rival William Hague, who proceeded to win the election comfortably. The contest was criticised for not involving the rank-and-file members of the Party, where surveys showed Clarke to be more popular. Clarke rejected the offer from Hague of a Shadow Cabinet role, opting instead to return to the backbenches.

Clarke contested the party leadership for a second time in 2001. Despite opinion polls again showing he was the most popular Conservative politician with the British public, he lost in a final round among the rank-and-file membership, a new procedure introduced by Hague, to a much less experienced, but strongly Eurosceptic rival, Iain Duncan Smith. This loss, by a margin of 62% to 38%, was attributed to the former Chancellor&#x27;s strong pro-European views being increasingly out-of-step with the party members&#x27; Euroscepticism. His campaign was managed by Andrew Tyrie.

Clarke opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After choosing not to stand for the leadership after Duncan Smith departed in 2003 in the interests of party unity, he returned to fight the 2005 leadership election. He still retained huge popularity among voters, with 40% of the public believing he would be the best leader. He was accused by Norman Tebbit of being &quot;lazy&quot; whilst leadership rival Sir Malcolm Rifkind suggested that Clarke&#x27;s pro-European views could have divided the Conservative Party had Clarke won. In the event, Clarke was eliminated in the first round of voting by Conservative MPs. Eventual winner David Cameron appointed Clarke to head a Democracy Task Force as part of his extensive 18-month policy review in December 2005, exploring issues such as the reform of the House of Lords and party funding. Clarke is President of the Tory Reform Group, a liberal, pro-European ginger group within the Conservative Party.

Clarke became known as &quot;an economic and social liberal, an internationalist and a strong supporter of the European idea&quot;.

In 2006, he described Cameron&#x27;s plans for a British Bill of Rights as &quot;xenophobic and legal nonsense&quot;.

===Parliamentary expenses scandal===

On 12 May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Clarke had &quot;flipped&quot; his Council Tax. He had told the Parliamentary authorities that his main home was in the Rushcliffe constituency, enabling him to claim a second-home allowance on his London residence, leaving the taxpayer to foot the bill for Council Tax due on that property. However, he told Rushcliffe Borough Council in Nottinghamshire that he spent so little time at his constituency address that his wife Gillian should qualify for a 25% Council Tax (single person&#x27;s) discount, saving the former Chancellor around £650 per year. Land Registry records showed that Clarke no longer had a mortgage on his Nottinghamshire home where he has lived since 1987. Instead he held a mortgage on his London property, which was being charged to the taxpayer at £480 per month.

===Return to the frontbench===
In 2009, Clarke became Shadow Business Secretary in Opposition to the then-Business Secretary, Lord Mandelson. David Cameron flattered Clarke as about the only one able to challenge Mandelson and Brown&#x27;s economic credibility. Two days later it emerged that Clarke had warned in a speech a month earlier that President Barack Obama could see David Cameron as a &quot;right-wing nationalist&quot; if the Conservatives maintained Eurosceptic policies and that Obama would &quot;start looking at whoever is in Germany or France if we start being isolationist&quot;. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; said &quot;Clarke has in effect agreed to disagree with the Tories&#x27; official Eurosceptic line&quot;.

===Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary===

On 12 May 2010, Clarke&#x27;s appointment as Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor was announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in the Coalition Government formed between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties. James Macintyre, political editor of &quot;Prospect&quot;, argued that in this ministerial role he had instigated a process of radical reform.

In June 2010, Clarke signalled an end to short prison sentences after warning it was &quot;virtually impossible&quot; to rehabilitate any inmate in less than 12 months. In his first major speech after taking office, Clarke indicated a major shift in penal policy by saying prison was not effective in many cases. This could result in more offenders being handed community sentences. Clarke, who described the current prison population of 85,000 as &quot;astonishing&quot;, received immediate criticism from some colleagues in a Party renowned for its tough stance on law and order. He signalled that fathers who fail to pay child maintenance, disqualified drivers and criminals fighting asylum refusals could be among the first to benefit and should not be sent to prison.

Clarke announced in February 2011 that the Government intended to scrutinise the relationship between the European Court of Human Rights and national parliaments.

In May 2011, controversy related to Clarke&#x27;s reported views on sentencing for those convicted of rape resurfaced after an interview on the radio station BBC 5 Live, where he discussed a proposal to increase the reduction of sentences for criminals, including rapists, who pleaded guilty pre-trial, from a third to a half. In the interview he incorrectly asserted that the reason for the low average sentence of those convicted of rape was that legal definition of &quot;rape&quot; in England and Wales included such less serious offences as consensual sex between a 17 year old and a 15 year old.

In 2011 and 2012, Clarke faced criticism for his Justice and Security Bill, in particular those aspects of it that allow secret trials when &quot;national security&quot; is at stake. &quot;The Economist&quot; stated: &quot;the origins of the proposed legislation lie in civil cases brought by former Guantánamo detainees, the best-known of whom was Binyam Mohamed, alleging that government intelligence and security agencies (MI6 and MI5) were complicit in their rendition and torture&quot;. Prominent civil liberties and human rights campaigners argued: &quot;the worst excesses of the war on terror have been revealed by open courts and a free media. Yet the Justice and Security Green Paper seeks to place Government above the law and would undermine such crucial scrutiny.&quot;

===Minister without Portfolio===

Following the 2012 Cabinet reshuffle, Clarke was moved from Justice Secretary to Minister without Portfolio. It was also announced that he would assume the role of roving Trade Envoy with responsibility for promoting British business and trade interests abroad, a position which he enjoyed.

In the 2014 Cabinet reshuffle, after more than 20 years serving as a Minister, it was announced that Clarke had stepped down from government, to return to the backbenches. Clarke was honoured as a Companion of Honour, upon the Prime Minister&#x27;s recommendation, in July 2014. His total time as a government minister is the fifth-longest in the modern era after Winston Churchill, Arthur Balfour, Rab Butler, and the Duke of Devonshire.

===Return to the backbenches===
Clarke was opposed to Brexit during the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom&#x27;s continued membership of the European Union, and opposed the holding of the referendum in the first place. He was the sole Conservative MP to vote against the triggering of Article 50.

During the 2016 Conservative leadership election Clarke was interviewed by Sky News on 5 July 2016 and made negative comments to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, about the &quot;fiasco&quot; (leadership contest) and about three of the candidates. In a widely circulated video clip, he referred to Theresa May as a &quot;bloody difficult woman&quot;, joked that Michael Gove, who was &quot;wild&quot;, would &quot;go to war with at least three countries at once&quot; and characterised some of the utterances of Andrea Leadsom as &quot;extremely stupid&quot;. Clarke added that Gove &quot;did us all a favour by getting rid of Boris. The idea of Boris as prime minister is ridiculous.&quot;

In February 2017, following the death of Gerald Kaufman, Clarke succeeded as Father of the House, continuing after his re-election as an MP at the 2017 general election.

In December 2017, Clarke voted along with fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve and nine other Conservative MPs against the government, and in favour of guaranteeing Parliament a &quot;meaningful vote&quot; on any Brexit deal Britain agrees with the European Union.

Clarke endorsed Rory Stewart during the 2019 Conservative leadership election.

In September 2019, after Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost a number of key votes in the House of Commons, Clarke stated that it would be &quot;not inconceivable&quot; for him to become Prime Minister leading a government of national unity in order to revoke Article 50 and prevent Brexit. Other politicians who were suggested for such a role at the time included Harriet Harman, his female counterpart as Mother of the House of Commons. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson supported the proposal, though Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Opposition, both dismissed the suggestion. As it turned out, a vote of no-confidence was not in fact tabled against Boris Johnson&#x27;s government and no such government of national unity was formed or took office.

===Sitting as an Independent===
On 3 September 2019, Clarke joined 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted against a Conservative motion which subsequently failed. Effectively, they helped block Johnson&#x27;s no-deal Brexit plan from proceeding on 31 October. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip and were expelled as Conservative MPs, requiring them to sit as independents. If they decided to run for re-election in a future election, the party would block their selection as Conservative candidates, though Clarke opted not to do so.

On the edition of 3 September of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot;, Clarke discussed the situation, saying that he no longer recognised the Conservative Party, referring to it as &quot;the Brexit Party, rebadged&quot;. His rationale was &quot;It&#x27;s been taken over by a rather knockabout sort of character, who&#x27;s got this bizarre crash-it-through philosophy... a Cabinet which is the most right-wing Cabinet any Conservative Party has ever produced.&quot; In an interview on 7 September, Clarke rejected the suggestion that, like other former Conservative MPs, he could join the Liberal Democrats, but noted that, if he were to cast &quot;a protest vote&quot;, he would &quot;follow the Conservative tradition of voting Lib Dem.&quot;

In his capacity as Father of the House, Clarke presided over the House of Commons&#x27; 2019 Speakership election. He then retired from the House of Commons at the 2019 general election. Since Dennis Skinner lost his seat in the election, Peter Bottomley succeeded as Father of the House.

=== House of Lords ===
Nominated in early 2020 for elevation to the peerage by Boris Johnson, on 4 September he was created Baron Clarke of Nottingham, &quot;of West Bridgford in the County of Nottinghamshire&quot;. Taking the Conservative Whip, Lord Clarke made his maiden speech on 28 September 2020.

==Corporate, media and other work==
Whilst serving as a backbench MP and as a Shadow Cabinet Minister, Clarke accepted several non-executive directorships:

* Deputy Chairman and a director of British American Tobacco (BAT) (1998–2007), for which Clarke faced allegations relating to activities of BAT in lobbying the developing world to reject stronger health warnings on cigarette packets.
* Chairman (non-executive) of Unichem
* Director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust
* Member from June 2007 of the Advisory Board of Centaurus Capital, a London-based hedge fund management company.
* Clarke is a member of the advisory board of Agcapita Farmland Investment Partnership, a Canadian farmland investment fund.
* Director (non-executive) of Independent News and Media (UK).
* Participant at the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group in 1993, 1998–2000, 2003–04, 2006–08 and 2012–13.

Also as a backbencher, Clarke declared engagement in non-political media work:
* presented several series of jazz programmes on BBC Radio Four, including one on his namesake, bebop drummer Kenny Clarke
* wrote a monthly column for &quot;Financial Mail on Sunday&quot; (£10,001–15,000)
* wrote a weekly commentary or interview for Bloomberg Television (£10,001–15,000)
* undertook occasional lecturing, on a self-employed basis.

==Personal life==
In 1964, Clarke married Gillian Edwards, a Cambridge contemporary; they had a son and a daughter. She died of cancer in July 2015.

Clarke&#x27;s enthusiasm for cigars, jazz and motor racing is well known, and he enjoys birdwatching as well as reading political history. He is also popularly recognised for his affection for suede &quot;Hush Puppies&quot;, a brand of shoe, which became a &quot;trademark&quot; of his during his early ministerial days. His autobiography denies he wore Hush Puppies and says these suede shoes were hand-made by Crockett &amp; Jones.

Clarke is a sports enthusiast, being a supporter of both local football clubs Notts County and Nottingham Forest, who offered him a chair, and a former President of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. He is President of both Radcliffe Olympic and the Radcliffe on Trent Male Voice Choir, and a keen follower of Formula One motorsport. He was involved with tobacco giant British American Tobacco&#x27;s Formula One team British American Racing (BAR) and has attended Grands Prix in support of the BAR team. BAR was sold to Honda in 2005. He also appeared on the podium of the 2012 British Grand Prix to present the first-place trophy to Mark Webber.

Clarke attended the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final and jokingly claims to have been influential in persuading the linesman, Tofiq Bahramov, to award a goal to Geoff Hurst when the England striker had seen his shot hit the crossbar of opponents West Germany, leaving doubt as to whether the ball had crossed the line. Clarke&#x27;s position in the Wembley crowd was right behind the linesman at the time and he shouted at the official to award a goal.

Lord Clarke is a lover of real ale and has been an active member of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). 

His memoir, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, was published in October 2016.

<text>The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is an intelligence agency and combat support agency of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), specializing in defense and military intelligence.

A component of the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community (IC), DIA informs national civilian and defense policymakers about the military intentions and capabilities of foreign governments and non-state actors. It also provides intelligence assistance, integration and coordination across uniformed military service intelligence components, which remain structurally separate from DIA. The agency&#x27;s role encompasses the collection and analysis of military-related foreign political, economic, industrial, geographic, and medical and health intelligence. DIA produces approximately one-quarter of all intelligence content that goes into the President&#x27;s Daily Brief.

DIA&#x27;s intelligence operations extend beyond the zones of combat, and approximately half of its employees serve overseas at hundreds of locations and in U.S. embassies in 140 countries. The agency specializes in the collection and analysis of human-source intelligence (HUMINT), both overt and clandestine, while also handling U.S. military-diplomatic relations abroad. DIA concurrently serves as the national manager for the highly technical measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) and as the Defense Department manager for counterintelligence programs. The agency has no law enforcement authority, contrary to occasional portrayals in American popular culture.

DIA is a national-level intelligence organization which does not belong to a single military element or within the traditional chain of command, instead answering to the Secretary of Defense directly through the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. Around 2008, three-quarters of the agency&#x27;s 17,000 employees were career civilians who were experts in various fields of defense and military interest or application; and although no military background is required, 48% of agency employees have some past military service. DIA has a tradition of marking unclassified deaths of its employees on the organization&#x27;s Memorial Wall.

Established in 1961 under President John F. Kennedy by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, DIA was involved in U.S. intelligence efforts throughout the Cold War and rapidly expanded, both in size and scope, after the September 11 attacks. Because of the sensitive nature of its work, the spy organization has been embroiled in numerous controversies, including those related to its intelligence-gathering activities, to its role in torture, as well as to attempts to expand its activities on U.S. soil.

== Overview ==
The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency is an intelligence officer who is nominated by the US President and confirmed by the US Senate. He or she is the primary intelligence adviser to the Secretary of Defense and also answers to the Director of National Intelligence. The Director is also the Commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, a subordinate command of United States Strategic Command, which is headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. Additionally, he or she chairs the Military Intelligence Board, which coordinates activities of the entire US defense intelligence community.


DIA is headquartered in Washington, D.C., on Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling with major operational activities at the Pentagon and at each Unified Combatant Command, as well as in more than a hundred U.S. embassies around the world, where it deploys alongside other government partners (e.g., the CIA) and also operates the U.S. Defense Attache Offices. Additionally, the agency has staff deployed at the Col. James N. Rowe Building at Rivanna Station in Charlottesville, Virginia, National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) in Fort Detrick, Maryland, Missile and Space Intelligence Center (MSIC) in Huntsville, Alabama, Russell-Knox Building on Marine Corps Base Quantico, National Center for Credibility Assessment at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and Defense Intelligence Support Center (DISC) in Reston, Virginia. 
Since 2012, the Intelligence Community Campus-Bethesda in Maryland serves as the location of the National Intelligence University as well as a facility for DIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Less known than its civilian equivalent or its cryptologic counterpart, DIA and its personnel have at times been portrayed in works of American popular culture. As with other U.S. foreign intelligence organizations, the agency&#x27;s role has occasionally been confused with those of law enforcement agencies. DIA&#x27;s parent organization, the Department of Defense, features in fiction and media much more prominently due to the public&#x27;s greater awareness of its existence and the general association of military organizations with warfare, rather than spycraft.

== Comparison to other intelligence community members ==

=== CIA ===
DIA and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are distinct organizations with different functions. DIA focuses on national level defense-military topics, while CIA is concentrated on broader, more general intelligence needs of the US President and his Cabinet. Additionally, due to DIA&#x27;s designation as a combat support agency, it has special responsibilities in meeting intelligence requirements specifically for the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), and Combatant Commanders, both in peace and at war. Although there are misconceptions in the media and public about the DIA–CIA rivalry, the two agencies have a mutually beneficial relationship and division of labor. According to a former senior U.S official who worked with both agencies, &quot;the CIA doesn&#x27;t want to be looking for surface-to-air missiles in Libya&quot; while it is also tasked with evaluating the Syrian opposition. CIA and DIA Operations Officers all go through the same type of clandestine training at Camp Peary, an interagency Defense installation under CIA administration better known in popular culture by its CIA nickname &quot;The Farm&quot;.

=== DIA and the military services ===
DIA is not a collective of all U.S. military intelligence units and the work it performs is not in lieu of that falling under intelligence components of individual services. Unlike the Russian GRU, which encompasses equivalents of nearly all joint U.S. military intelligence operations, DIA assists and coordinates the activities of individual service-level intelligence units (i.e. 25 AF, INSCOM, etc.), but they nevertheless remain separate entities. As a general rule, DIA handles national-level, long-term and strategic intelligence needs, whereas service-level intelligence components handle tactical, short-term goals pertinent to their respective services. DIA does, however, lead coordination efforts with the military intelligence units and with the national DOD intelligence services (NSA, NGA, NRO) in its role as chair of the Military Intelligence Board and through the co-located Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.

The Military Intelligence Integrated Database (MIDB) is due to be replaced by the Machine-Assisted Analytic Rapid-Repository System (MARS) beginning in spring 2024.

== Organization ==

DIA is organized into four directorates and five regional centers
Directorate for Operations:
* Defense Clandestine Service (DCS): DCS conducts clandestine espionage activities around the world and is the executive agent for human intelligence operations throughout the Department of Defense. Staffed by civilian and military personnel, the DCS is a consolidation of the former Defense Human Intelligence Service and works in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Directorate of Operations, among other national HUMINT entities. It globally deploys teams of case officers, interrogation experts, field analysts, linguists, technical specialists, and special operations forces.
* Defense Attache System (DAS): DAS represents the United States in defense and military-diplomatic relations with foreign governments worldwide. It also manages and conducts overt human intelligence collection activities. Defense Attaches serve from Defense Attache Offices (DAO) co-located at more than a hundred United States Embassies in foreign nations, represent the Secretary of Defense in diplomatic relations with foreign governments and militaries, and coordinate military activities with partner nations.
* Defense Cover Office (DCO): DCO is a DIA component responsible for executing cover programs for agency&#x27;s intelligence officers, as well as those for the entire Department of Defense.

Directorate for Analysis: The Directorate of Analysis manages the all-source analysis elements of DIA, and is responsible for developing and deploying analytic tradecraft throughout the Defense Intelligence Enterprise. Analysts analyze and disseminate finalized intelligence products, focusing on national, strategic and operational-level military issues that may arise from worldwide political, economic, medical, natural or other related processes. Analysts contribute to the President&#x27;s Daily Brief and the National Intelligence Estimates. Analysts serve DIA in all of the agency&#x27;s facilities and DIA has the most forward deployed analysts in the Intelligence Community.

Directorate for Science and Technology: The Directorate for Science and Technology manages DIA&#x27;s technical assets and personnel. These assets gather and analyze Measurement and Signature Intelligence, which is a technical intelligence discipline that serves to detect, track, identify or describe the signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources. This often includes radar intelligence, acoustic intelligence, nuclear intelligence, and chemical and biological intelligence. DIA is designated the national manager for MASINT collection within the United States Intelligence Community, coordinating all MASINT gathering across agencies. DIA is also the national manager of the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS), the central Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) processing network for the United States, and Stone Ghost, a network for US and partner nations.

Directorate for Mission Services: The Directorate for Mission Services provides administrative, technical, and programmatic support to the agency&#x27;s domestic and global operations and analytic efforts. The Directorate also manages DIA&#x27;s training centers -- the Joint Military Intelligence Training Center and the Joint Military Attaché School. This includes providing counterintelligence to the agency as well as serving as the counterintelligence executive agent for the Department of Defense.

Centers: DIA is divided into five regional centers and two functional centers which manage the agency&#x27;s efforts in these areas of responsibility. These centers are the Americas and Transnational Threats Center, the Indo-Pacific Regional Center, the Europe/Eurasia Regional Center, the Middle East/Africa Regional Center, the China Mission Group, the Defense Resources and Infrastructure Center, and the Defense Combating Terrorism Center. DIA also manages Community-wide centers such as the National Center for Medical Intelligence, the Missile and Space Intelligence Center, the National Media Exploitation Center, and the Underground Facilities Analysis Center (UFAC).

Further, DIA is responsible for administering the JIOCEUR and various Joint Intelligence Centers which serve and are co-located with each of the Unified Combatant Commands. Additionally, DIA manages the Directorate for Intelligence, Joint Staff (J2) which advises and supports the Joint Chiefs of Staff with foreign military intelligence for defense policy and war planning.

DIA also managed the National Intelligence University (NIU) on behalf of the Intelligence Community before transitioning it to ODNI in June 2021. NIU and the John T. Hughes Library is housed at the Intelligence Community campus in Bethesda, Maryland and has several branch campuses at RAF Molesworth, MacDill Air Force Base, and Marine Corps Base Quantico as well as academic programs at the NSA and NGA.

===DIA Police===
The DIA has its own police force (established in 1963), made up of federal officers who protect DIA people and property. DIA Police provide law enforcement and police services, emergency response and physical security at DIA campuses.

DIA Police have 170 sworn, uniformed officers that protect and police the six DIA sites (Headquarters, Reston, Charlottesville, DIA Logistics Operation Center, National Center for Medical Intelligence and Missile and Space Intelligence Center).
====Training====
DIA Police Officers are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center for three months before being certified.

====Authority====
DIA Police operate under the U.S. Marshal&#x27;s Office Special Deputation and jurisdictional and functional authority within the District of Columbia under a cooperative agreement with the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia.

====Rank structure and organization====
DIA Police have the following rank structure:

*Officer
*Special Agent (investigations)
*Sergeant
*Captain

DIA Police have K9, HAZMAT, SRT and also support DIA field operations.

==History==
From World War II until the creation of DIA in 1961, the three Military Departments collected, produced and distributed their intelligence for individual use. This turned out to be duplicative, costly, and ineffective as each department provided their own, often conflicting estimates to the Secretary of Defense and other Federal agencies. 
While the Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 aimed to correct these deficiencies, the intelligence responsibilities remained unclear, the coordination was poor and the results fell short of national reliability and focus. As a result of this poor organization, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed the Joint Study Group in 1960 to find better ways for organizing the nation&#x27;s military intelligence activities.

Acting on the recommendations of the Joint Study Group, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of his decision to establish the DIA in February 1961. He ordered them to develop a plan that would integrate all the military intelligence of the DoD, a move that met strong resistance from the service intelligence units, whose commanders viewed DIA as undesirable encroachment on their turf. Despite this resistance, during the spring and summer of 1961, as Cold War tensions flared over the Berlin Wall, Air Force Lieutenant General Joseph Carroll took the lead in planning and organizing this new agency. The JCS published Directive 5105.21, &quot;Defense Intelligence Agency&quot; on August 1, and DIA began operations with a handful of employees in borrowed office space on October 1, 1961.

DIA originally reported to the Secretary through the JCS. The new agency&#x27;s mission was the continuous task of collecting, processing, evaluating, analyzing, integrating, producing, and disseminating military intelligence for DoD and related national stakeholders. Other objectives included more efficiently allocating scarce intelligence resources, more effectively managing all DoD intelligence activities, and eliminating redundancies in facilities, organizations, and tasks.

=== DIA begins operation ===
Following DIA&#x27;s establishment, the Services reluctantly transferred intelligence functions and resources to it on a time-phased basis to avoid rapidly degrading the overall effectiveness of defense intelligence. A year after its formation, in October 1962, the agency faced its first major intelligence test during the superpower Cuban Missile Crisis confrontation that developed after Soviet missiles were discovered at bases in Cuba by Air Force spy planes.

In late 1962, DIA established the Defense Intelligence School (now the National Intelligence University), and on January 1, 1963, it activated a new Production Center. Several Service elements were merged to form this production facility, which occupied the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; Buildings at Arlington Hall Station, Virginia.

The agency also added an Automated Data Processing (ADP) Center on February 19, a Dissemination Center on March 31, and a Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate on April 30, 1963. DIA assumed the staff support functions of the J-2, Joint Staff, on July 1, 1963. Two years later, on July 1, 1965, DIA accepted responsibility for the Defense Attaché System—the last function the Services transferred to DIA.

During the 1960s, DIA analysts focused on China&#x27;s detonation of an atomic bomb and the launching of its Cultural Revolution; increasing unrest among African and South Asian nations; fighting in Cyprus and Kashmir; and the missile gap between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In the late 1960s, crises that tested intelligence responsiveness included: the Tet Offensive in Vietnam; the Six-Day War between Egypt and Israel; continuing troubles in Africa, particularly Nigeria; North Korea&#x27;s seizure of the ; and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

=== Years of transition ===
The early 1970s were transitional years as the agency shifted its focus from consolidating its functions to establishing itself as a credible producer of national-level intelligence. This proved difficult at first since sweeping manpower decrements between 1968 and 1975 had reduced agency manpower by 31 percent and precipitated mission reductions and a broad organizational restructuring. Challenges facing DIA at this time included the rise of Ostpolitik in Germany; the emergence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the Middle East; and the U.S. incursion into Cambodia from South Vietnam.

The agency&#x27;s reputation grew considerably by the mid-1970s, as decision makers increasingly recognized the value of its products. Agency analysts in 1972 concentrated on Lebanon, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to China, the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état, the formation of Sri Lanka, and the prisoners of war being held in Southeast Asia. Subsequent challenges involved: détente; the development of arms control agreements; the Paris peace talks (Vietnam); the Yom Kippur War; and global energy concerns.

Intense Congressional review during 1975–76 created turbulence within the Intelligence Community. The Murphy and Rockefeller Commission investigations of charges of intelligence abuse ultimately led to an Executive Order that modified many Intelligence Community functions. At the same time, with U.S. involvement in Vietnam ending, defense intelligence faced a significant decline in resources. During this period, DIA conducted numerous studies on ways of improving its intelligence products. Despite these and other Community-wide efforts to improve intelligence support, the loss of resources during the 1970s limited the Community&#x27;s ability to collect and produce timely intelligence and ultimately contributed to intelligence shortcomings in Iran, Afghanistan, and other strategic areas.

Special DIA task forces were set up to monitor crises such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the overthrow of Iranian monarchy, and the taking of American hostages from the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979. Also, of serious concern were the Vietnamese takeover in Phnom Penh, the China–Vietnam border war, the overthrow of Idi Amin in Uganda, the north–south Yemen dispute, troubles in Pakistan, border clashes between Libya and Egypt, the Sandinista takeover in Nicaragua, and the Soviet movement of combat troops to Cuba during the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II.

Following the promulgation in 1979 of Executive Order 12036, which restructured the Intelligence Community and better outlined DIA&#x27;s national and departmental responsibilities, the agency was reorganized around five major directorates: production, operations, resources, external affairs, and J-2 support.

=== 1980s ===
By the 1980s, DIA had transformed into a fully integrated national-level intelligence agency. Its 1981 flagship publication &quot;Soviet Military Power&quot;, the most comprehensive overview of Soviet military strength and capabilities at the time, was met with wide acclaim; SMP continued to be produced by DIA as a serialized publication roughly over the next decade. In 1983, in order to research the flow of technology to the Soviet Union, the Reagan Administration created Project Socrates within the agency. Over the following years Project Socrates&#x27;s scope broadened to include monitoring of foreign advanced technology as a whole. Project Socrates ended in 1990 with Michael Sekora, the project&#x27;s director, leaving in protest when the Bush Administration reduced funding.

In 1984, the Clandestine Services organization, designated STAR WATCHER, was created under DIA with the mission of conducting intelligence collection on perceived areas of conflict and against potential adversaries in developing countries. A critical objective was to create a Joint Services career path for case officers, since individual Services were inconsistent in their support of clandestine operations, and case officers were routinely sacrificed during reductions in force. Ultimately, the organization was created to balance CIA&#x27;s espionage operations which primarily targeted Soviet KGB/GRU officers, but ignored and were dismissive of Third World targets in areas of potential military conflict.

Although there were previous attempts to establish such a DoD level espionage organization, there was no authorization document by which it could be established. This changed when Gregory Davis, a military intelligence officer, defined and established a clandestine services program under the U.S. Southern Command&#x27;s &quot;Plan Green&quot;. The program was then authorized by JCS Chairman John Vessey, and sanctioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (&quot;SSCI&quot;), with the sponsorship of Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) and Senator Barry Goldwater (R-AZ). The Goldwater–Nichols DoD Reorganization Act was crafted partly to force military officers to serve in a Joint Services assignment in order to qualify for flag rank—ensuring the future of case officers from each Service. The clandestine organization within DIA grew and flourished, and was cited by the SSCI for its intelligence achievements. Personnel selection and training were rigorous, and the case officers were notable for their advanced educations, area knowledge, and multilingual capabilities. The program was partially gutted under President Bill Clinton as he foresaw no conflict which would justify its existence, but, it was resurrected under President George W. Bush.

Designated a combat support agency under the Goldwater–Nichols Act, DIA moved to increase cooperation with the Unified &amp; Specified Commands and to begin developing a body of joint intelligence doctrine. Intelligence support to U.S. allies in the Middle East intensified as the Iran–Iraq War spilled into the Persian Gulf. DIA provided significant intelligence support to Operation Earnest Will while closely monitoring incidents such as the Iraqi rocket attack on the , the destruction of Iranian oil platforms, and Iranian attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers. The &quot;Toyota War&quot; between Libya and Chad and the turmoil in Haiti added to DIA&#x27;s heavy production workload, as did unrest in other parts of Latin America, Somalia, Ethiopia, Burma, Pakistan, and the Philippines.

=== Post–Cold War transformation ===
With the end of the Cold War, defense intelligence began a period of reevaluation following the fall of the Soviet system in many Eastern European countries, the reunification of Germany (1990), and ongoing economic reforms in the region. In response to Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, DIA set up an extensive, 24-hour, crisis management cell designed to tailor national-level intelligence support to the coalition forces assembled to expel Iraq from Kuwait. By the time Operation Desert Storm began, some 2,000 agency personnel were involved in the intelligence support effort. Most of them associated in some way with the national-level Joint Intelligence Center (JIC), which DIA established at The Pentagon to integrate the intelligence being produced throughout the Community. DIA sent more than 100 employees into the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations to provide intelligence support.
The Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC), and the Missile and Space Intelligence Center (MSIC), associated with the Army for over 20 and 50 years respectively, became part of DIA in January 1992. This was part of the continuing effort to consolidate intelligence production and make it more efficient.

On September 11, 2001, seven DIA employees died along with 118 other victims at the Pentagon in a terrorist attack when American Airlines Flight 77 piloted by five Al-Qaeda hijackers plowed into the western side of the building, as part of the September 11 attacks. The death of seven employees at once was the largest combined loss in DIA&#x27;s history. On September 11, 2009, DIA dedicated a memorial to the seven employees lost in the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon. The memorial is located in the garden at the DIA Analysis Center in Washington, D.C.

Since the September 11 attacks, DIA has been active in nuclear proliferation intelligence collection and analysis with particular interests in North Korea and Iran as well as counter-terrorism. DIA was also involved with the intelligence build-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was a subject in the Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq. After the invasion, DIA led the Iraq Survey Group to find the alleged Weapons of Mass Destruction. The agency has conflicted with the CIA in collection and analysis on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and has often represented the Pentagon in the CIA–DoD intelligence rivalry due to DIA&#x27;s own Clandestine HUMINT collection.

In 2012, DIA announced an expansion of clandestine collection efforts. The newly consolidated Defense Clandestine Service (DCS) would absorb the Defense HUMINT Service and expand DIA&#x27;s overseas espionage apparatus to complement the work of corresponding elements at CIA. DCS would focus on military intelligence concerns—issues that the CIA has been unable to manage due to lack of personnel, expertise or time—and would initially deal with Islamist militia groups in Africa, weapons transfers between North Korea and Iran, and Chinese military modernization. The DCS works in conjunction with CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Operations and the Joint Special Operations Command in overseas operations.

In October 2015, the Pentagon said that DIA appointed a British Royal Air Force officer as its first deputy director in charge of improving integration between U.S. intelligence units and spy agencies of other English-speaking countries in the Five Eyes alliance. This was the first time that a foreign national was appointed to a senior position at a U.S. intelligence agency.

Today, corporations carry out a large amount of DIA&#x27;s workload. In fiscal year 2020 alone, such activity included work in DIA&#x27;s Science &amp; Technology Directorate, National Media Exploitation Center, and Missile &amp; Space Intelligence Center. 
Corporations also worked on technology transfer analysis and assessments at DIA&#x27;s Charlottesville branch, planned and analyzed DIA&#x27;s workforce, carried out technical support, and conducted polygraph examinations and background investigations.

== Employment requirements and polygraph ==

Due to the sensitive nature of DIA&#x27;s work, all of its personnel, including interns and contractors, are subject to the same security standards and must obtain a Top Secret clearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) access. Collateral Top Secret clearances granted by the DoD are not sufficient to grant access to DIA&#x27;s SCI information. Additionally, the SCI access granted by other intelligence agencies, such as CIA or NSA, do not transfer to DIA and vice versa.

In addition to the rigorous background investigations, psychological and drug screening, as well as security interviews, DIA requires that its applicants pass the agency polygraph. In fact, DIA exercises operational control over the National Center for Credibility Assessment (NCCA), which establishes polygraphing standards and trains polygraphers for placement across the entire intelligence community. In 2008, the agency started expanding its polygraph program in an attempt to screen 5,700 prospective and current employees every year. This was a several fold increase from 2002 when, according to information provided to Congress, DIA conducted 1,345 polygraphs. According to the unclassified DIA document cited in the news report, since the mid-2000s the agency started hiring contract polygraphers in addition to the permanent DIA polygraphers and added 13 polygraphing studios to those the spy organization already operated. This expanded polygraph screening at DIA continued notwithstanding documented technical problems discovered in the Lafayette computerized polygraph system used by the agency; the organization allegedly refused to change the flawed Lafayette polygraph but declined to comment as to the reasoning.

Unlike the CIA and NSA polygraphs, DIA polygraphs are only of Counterintelligence Scope (CI), rather than Full Scope (FS) (also known as Expanded Scope Screening or ESS), which is ostensibly more intrusive as far as one&#x27;s personal life is concerned. DIA administered only a handful of FS polygraphs and only for those personnel who were to be detailed to the CIA. Additionally, DIA conducted a handful of FS polygraphs on its personnel remaining overseas in excess of 6.5 years, although this practice appeared to be outside the scope of DIA&#x27;s authorization at the time.

Like with other intelligence agencies, failing to pass the DIA polygraph is a virtual guarantee that an applicant will be judged unsuitable for agency employment. In fact, according to a report published by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense of Intelligence, while the usually more stringent NSA is willing to give its applicants several shots at passing the polygraph, DIA tends to give one or at most two opportunities to clear the test, after which the employment offer is rescinded. The same report recommended that DIA seek permanent authority to conduct more intrusive Expanded Scope Screenings due to their supposed usefulness in eliciting admissions from applicants.

Similarly to other intelligence agencies, employees are required to take periodic polygraph examinations throughout their careers. However, no unfavorable administrative actions will be taken against them based solely on their results.

== Budget and personnel ==
DIA&#x27;s budget and exact personnel numbers are classified. Classified Information is not willingly revealed to the public or with anyone that does not have a need-to-know verified. The agency does reveal that currently, it has approximately 17,000 employees, two-thirds of whom are civilians and approximately 50% of whom work at more than 141 overseas locations. In 1994, it was revealed that DIA requested approximately $4 billion in funding for the period of 1996–2001 ($6.3 billion inflation adjusted), averaging $666 million per year ($1.05 billion inflation adjusted). The agency, however, has nearly doubled in size since then and also assumed additional responsibilities from various intelligence elements from across the Department of Defense, CIA and wider intelligence community. In 2006, at the height of Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s push to further expand the scope of military intelligence beyond tactical considerations, DIA was estimated to receive up to $3 billion annually.

According to classified documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2013, the National Intelligence Program (NIP) component of the overall US intelligence budget contained approximately $4.4 billion/year for the General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP), which is managed by DIA, even as it is not exclusively for the agency&#x27;s use. The numbers exclude the Military Intelligence Component (MIP) of the overall US intelligence budget, which by itself has averaged more than $20 billion per year in the past decade.

== Notable cases of espionage ==
DIA is one of a few U.S. federal organizations, such as the CIA and FBI, that rely on human espionage to collect information. For this reason, the agency has been involved in numerous espionage events over the course of decades.

=== Spying for DIA ===
* Victor Kaliadin () – a CEO of a Russian company &quot;Elers Electron&quot;, who in 2001 was sentenced to 14 years in prison for selling a ring run by a DIA agent technical information on Arena, the Russian active protection system for tanks. He died of his fourth heart attack in 2004.
* Igor Sutyagin – Russian arms control and nuclear weapons specialist convicted in 2004 of spying for DIA. Released in 2010 in exchange for Russian spies arrested in the U.S. during the break-up of the Illegals Program. Denies any involvement in spying.
* Edmond Pope – A retired intelligence officer-turned-&quot;businessman&quot;, sentenced by a Russian court in 2000 to 20 years for buying up and smuggling classified military equipment out of the country as scrap metal. He was soon pardoned by newly elected Vladimir Putin but continues to assert that the Russian authorities used him as a scapegoat for their broken system. In the same interview with Larry King, however, he spoke of a plot by unspecified people in the U.S., as part of which Pope was being slowly poisoned in the Lefortovo Prison, with the hopes that he would eventually have to be transferred to a hospital, abducted on his way and smuggled out of the country; he claims that his representatives stopped the plot.
* Jerzy Strawa – a Polish engineer and an employee of the Ministry of Foreign Trade executed in 1968 at Mokotów Prison for passing industrial and defense information to DIA agents while on official trips in Austria and West Germany.
* Natan Sharansky – a former high ranking Israeli politician and Soviet dissident who, during his life in Russia, was sentenced to 13 years of prison with hard labor for spying for DIA. The prosecution alleged that he gave a DIA agent in journalist&#x27;s disguise—Robert Toth—a list of people who had access to military and other secrets. Sharansky was released in 1986 following a spy exchange that took place on the Glienicke Bridge between the USSR and the Western allies. In 2006, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
* Charles Dennis McKee – a DIA officer who, along with CIA&#x27;s Matthew Gannon, died as a result of the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing. The incident produced numerous conspiracy theories that the flight was bombed because the officers were aware of illicit U.S. intelligence drug activities or that the case was related to them trying to secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon. He is notably absent from DIA&#x27;s memorial wall (below)

=== Spying against DIA ===
* Ana Belén Montes – a senior DIA analyst arrested in 2001 for spying for the G2 of Cuba and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors alleged that she started spying in the mid-1980s, around the same time when CIA&#x27;s Aldrich Ames started his interaction with the KGB.
* Ronald Montaperto – a senior DIA intelligence analyst who pleaded guilty in 2006 for giving classified information to China&#x27;s MSS. Montaperto claimed that he was tricked and served only three months in jail due to letters of support from other pro-China intelligence analysts, pejoratively known as the &quot;Red Team&quot;, who &quot;harshly [criticize] anyone who raises questions about the threat posed by Beijing&#x27;s communist regime.&quot; One of such supporters, Lonnie Henley, was initially reprimanded by the ODNI for his support of Montaperto but was later promoted to acting national intelligence officer for East Asia.
* Waldo H. Dubberstein – a senior DIA intelligence officer for the Middle East and an associate of CIA arms smuggler Edwin P. Wilson who was indicted in 1983 for selling DIA secrets to Libya. The day after being charged, he was found dead in what was ruled a suicide.
* Henry Kyle Frese, former counterterrorism analyst for the DIA. He held &quot;Top Secret&quot; (TS) clearance. On February 20, 2020, Frese pleaded guilty to the willful transmission of Top Secret national defense information. He was sentenced on June 18, 2020, to two and a half years in prison after pleading guilty. 

== Controversies ==

=== Alleged torture with drugs, gay porn, and loud music ===

In 2003, the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s &quot;Working Group&quot; on interrogations requested that DIA come up with prisoner interrogation techniques for the group&#x27;s consideration. According to the 2008 US Senate Armed Services Committee report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, DIA began drawing up the list of techniques with the help of its civilian employee, a former Guantanamo Interrogation Control Element (ICE) Chief David Becker. Becker claimed that the Working Group members were particularly interested in aggressive methods and that he &quot;was encouraged to talk about techniques that
inflict pain.&quot;

It is unknown to what extent the agency&#x27;s recommendations were used or for how long, but according to the same Senate report, the list drawn up by DIA included the use of &quot;drugs such as sodium pentothal and Demerol,&quot; humiliation via female interrogators and sleep deprivation. Becker claimed that he recommended the use of drugs due to rumors that another intelligence agency, the name of which was redacted in the Senate report, had successfully used them in the past. According to the analysis of the Office of Defense Inspector General, DIA&#x27;s cited justification for the use of drugs was to &quot;[relax] detainee to cooperative state&quot; and that mind-altering substances were not used.

Some of the more lurid revelations of DIA&#x27;s alleged harsh interrogations came from FBI officers, who conducted their own screenings of detainees in Guantanamo along with other agencies. According to one account, the interrogators of what was then DIA&#x27;s Defense Humint Service (referenced in FBI correspondence as DHS), forced subjects to watch gay porn, draped them with the Israeli flag, and interrogated them in rooms lit by strobe lights for 16–18 hours, all the while telling prisoners that they were from FBI.

The real FBI operatives were concerned that DIA&#x27;s harsh methods and impersonation of FBI agents would complicate the FBI&#x27;s ability to do its job properly, saying &quot;The next time a real Agent tries to talk to that guy, you can imagine the result.&quot; A subsequent military inquiry countered FBI&#x27;s allegations by saying that the prisoner treatment was degrading but not inhumane, without addressing the allegation of DIA staff regularly impersonating FBI officers—usually a felony offense.

Similar activities transpired at the hands of DIA operatives in Bagram, where as recently as 2010 the organization ran the so-called &quot;Black Jail&quot;. According to a report published by &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, the jail was manned by DIA&#x27;s DCHC staff, who were accused of beating and sexually humiliating high-value targets held at the site. The detention center outlived the black sites run by the Central Intelligence Agency, with DIA allegedly continuing to use &quot;restricted&quot; interrogation methods in the facility under a secret authorization. It is unclear what happened to the secret facility after the 2013 transfer of the base to Afghan authorities following several postponements.

DIA&#x27;s harsh interrogation methods at times paled in comparison to those of some U.S. special operations forces. In 2004, interrogations by Joint Special Operations Command&#x27;s high-value targets special operations task forces (including Task Force 6-26) were so heavy-handed and physical with the detainees that two DIA officials complained, as a result of which they were threatened and put under surveillance by abusive military interrogators. The two DIA officials managed to share their accounts of abuse with the agency leadership, prompting DIA Director Lowell Jacoby to write a memo on this topic to the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence.

=== Skinny Puppy controversy ===
In 2014, Canadian electronic music group Skinny Puppy sent the Defense Intelligence Agency a symbolic bill of $666,000, after finding out that the agency used their music in Guantanamo during &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; (deemed torture by some) sessions. Their music was originally heard at GTMO by a guard, who happened to be a fan of Skinny Puppy and could not understand how his favorite music was being used in such a manner: &quot;[Skinny Puppy&#x27;s] songs are characterized by ... lyrics that call out corporate wrongdoing. The songs I heard at GTMO were heavily distorted, almost to the point of inaudibility. Even so, I would never have imagined that Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music would, or could, be used for enhanced interrogation&quot;. The officer conducting interrogation sessions allegedly stating that the Canadian group&#x27;s songs—which are &quot;characterized by relentless drumbeats, panicked, convulsive riffs, synth samples&quot;—were very effective for &quot;enhanced interrogation.&quot;

=== Attempts to expand domestic activities ===
Since mid-2000s, DIA has come under scrutiny for requesting new powers &quot;to covertly approach and cultivate &#x27;U.S. persons&#x27; and even recruit them as informants&quot; without disclosing they are doing so on behalf of the U.S. government. George Peirce, DIA&#x27;s general counsel, told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that his agency is &quot;not asking for the moon&quot; and that DIA officers &quot;only want to assess their [individual U.S. citizens&#x27;] suitability as a source, person to person&quot;, while protecting the ID and security of the agency operatives. The provision allowing DIA to covertly approach U.S. citizens was reportedly removed from the bill at the request of Senator Ron Wyden. It is unclear if the agency has received any additional powers since but it is known that until at least 2005 and possibly later, DIA&#x27;s &quot;personnel stationed in major U.S. cities [have been] ... monitoring the movements and activities—through high-tech equipment—of individuals and vehicles&quot;; this occurred parallel to the NSA&#x27;s warrantless surveillance that was of similarly dubious legality.

In 2008, with the consolidation of the new Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center (DCHC), DIA secured an additional authority to conduct &quot;offensive counterintelligence&quot;, which entails conducting clandestine operations, domestically and abroad, &quot;to thwart what the opposition is trying to do to us and to learn more about what they&#x27;re trying to get from us.&quot; While the agency remained vague about the exact meaning of offensive counterintelligence, experts opined that it &quot;could include planting a mole in a foreign intelligence service, passing disinformation to mislead the other side, or even disrupting enemy information systems&quot;, suggesting strong overlap between CI and traditional HUMINT operations.

According to the agency, Americans spying for a foreign intelligence service would not be covered under this mechanism and that DIA would coordinate in such cases with the FBI which, unlike any DIA components at the time, is designated a law enforcement agency. The media showed particular interest in the domestic aspect of DIA&#x27;s counterintelligence efforts due to the fact that agency&#x27;s newly created DCHC had absorbed the former Counterintelligence Field Activity, which had become infamous for storing data on American peace activists in the controversial TALON database that was eventually shut down.

=== 9/11 and Able Danger ===
Anthony Shaffer, a former DIA officer, has claimed that DIA was aware of and failed to adequately act against one of the organizers of the September 11 attacks prior to the event, in what became known as the Able Danger controversy. Shaffer&#x27;s claims were rejected and later his security clearance was revoked, with the Pentagon denying any wrongdoing. Later Shaffer published his book &quot;Operation Dark Heart&quot; but, upon complaints from DIA and NSA that it included national security information, the Defense Department went as far as to buy and destroy the initial 10,000 copies of the book, causing the Streisand effect.

=== German Neo-Nazi murders ===
In 2011, the German government uncovered a far-right terrorist group named National Socialist Underground, which was linked to a series of murders, including the murder of a police officer. A report by &quot;Stern&quot; claimed German BfV and DIA officers witnessed the murder of a policewoman during their surveillance of the &quot;Sauerland&quot; group—an Islamist organization that planned attacks on U.S. military installations in Germany—but that neither of the agencies reported it, thus enabling subsequent violent acts by the same criminal entities. The magazine cited an unverified DIA report that confirmed the agency&#x27;s officers were at the site of the incident. The authenticity of the alleged DIA observation protocol, on which &quot;Stern&quot; based its report, was swiftly denied by the BfV, while DIA refused to comment. An unnamed U.S. &quot;insider expert&quot; for intelligence matters told &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; he deemed it unlikely that DIA could be involved in that type of operation.

== Memorial wall ==

A memorial wall at the DIA headquarters is dedicated to those agency employees who lost their lives in the line of their intelligence work and whose deaths are not classified. The wall was first dedicated on December 14, 1988, by Director Leonard Perroots. It &quot;commemorates the profound individual sacrifices made on behalf of the United States by DIA members and acts as a reminder of the selflessness, dedication, and courage required to confront national challenges...&quot;

&quot;POOR IS THE NATION THAT HAS NO HEROES, BUT BEGGARED IS THE NATION THAT HAS AND FORGETS THEM.&quot; 

DIA also maintains a memorial in the headquarters courtyard dedicated to personnel lost in the attacks of 9/11 on the Pentagon. Additionally, the agency maintains the Torch Bearers Wall at its Headquarters. The Torch Bearers award is the highest honor bestowed to former DIA employees and recognizes their exceptional contributions to the agency&#x27;s mission.

== Seal ==
The flaming torch and its gold color represent knowledge, i.e., intelligence, and the dark background represents the unknown—&quot;the area of the truth&quot; still sought by the worldwide mission of the agency. The two red atomic ellipses symbolize the scientific and technical aspects of intelligence today and of the future. The 13 stars and the wreath are adopted from the Department of Defense seal and mean glory and peace, respectively, which the DoD secures as part of its work.

<text>Edvard Alexander Westermarck (20 November 1862 in Helsinki – 3 September 1939 in Tenala) was a Finnish philosopher and sociologist. Among other subjects, he studied exogamy and the incest taboo.

==Biography==
Westermarck was born in 1862 in a well-off Lutheran family, part of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland. His father worked at the University of Helsinki as a bursar, and his maternal grandfather was a professor at the same university. It was thus natural for Edvard to study there, obtaining his first degree in philosophy in 1886, but developing also an interest in anthropology and reading the works of Charles Darwin. His thesis, The History of Human Marriage, was published as a book in 1891, and would be published again in a substantially revised edition in 1921.

In 1892, Westermarck became a lecturer in Sociology at the University of Helsinki. While at the university, he became the chairman of the Prometheus Society, a student society promoting religious freedom. He was promoted to professor of Moral Philosophy in 1906 and occupied that chair until 1918, when he moved to the Åbo Akademi University in Turku. His students included Ragnar Numelin.

While still teaching Philosophy in Turku, he helped found academic sociology in the United Kingdom, becoming the first Martin White Professor of Sociology (with Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse) in 1907 in the University of London. One of the original reasons he spent time in London is he did not feel safe in Helsinki or Turku because of his advocacy of the independence of Finland, but even when the political situation quieted down, he continued teaching in both London and Turku until 1930 and 1932 respectively. He had also served for some years, between 1918 and 1921, as Rector of the Åbo Akademi University. He retired in 1932, and spent the rest of his life completing and publishing his major works, &quot;Ethical Relativity&quot; (1932), &quot;Three Essays on Sex and Morals&quot; (1934), &quot;The Future of Marriage in Western Civilization&quot; (1936) and &quot;Christianity and Morals&quot; (1939), the latter published in the year when he died. In 1929, he had published the English version, &quot;Memories of My Life&quot; of his autobiography, originally published in Swedish in 1927.

==Views==
He has been described as &quot;first Darwinian sociologist&quot; or &quot;the first sociobiologist&quot;, as well as “an authority in the history of morals and of marriage customs.” He denied the then prevailing view that early human beings lived in sexual promiscuity, arguing that in fact historically monogamy preceded polygamy. He maintained that “Marriage is rooted in the family rather than the family in the marriage”.

The phenomenon of reverse sexual imprinting, the diminution in sexual attraction between persons who lived in close domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one, now known as the Westermarck effect, was first formally described in his thesis &quot;The History of Human Marriage&quot; (1891).

Westermarck was also a scholar of Morocco and offered a positivist view of how its folk religion was formed in his two-volume work &quot;Ritual and Belief in Morocco&quot; (1926). He had started his fieldwork in Morocco as early as 1898, and visited the country 21 times in the next thirty years, spending in total seven years in the country. He also studied his favorite subject, marriage, there, publishing in 1914 &quot;Marriage Ceremonies of Morocco&quot;.

Westermarck critiqued Christian institutions and Christian ideas on the grounds that they lacked foundation. He was also a moral relativist and in his two-volume &quot;The Origin and Development of Moral Ideas&quot; (1906–1908) he argued that moral judgements are not rational but are based on emotions and on social approval or disapproval. As a consequence, he also denied the existence of general or universal moral truth.

In the UK, his name is often spelled Edward. His sister, Helena Westermarck, was a writer and artist.

==History==

Matrox&#x27;s first graphics card product was the ALT-256 for S-100 bus computers, released in 1978. The ALT-256 produced a 256 by 256 pixel monochrome display using an 8 kilobyte (64 kilobit) frame buffer consisting of 16 TMS4027 DRAM chips (4 kilobits each). An expanded version followed, the ALT-512, both available for Intel SBC bus machines as well. Through the 1980s, Matrox&#x27;s cards followed changes in the hardware side of the market, to Multibus and then the variety of PC standards.

During the 1990s, the Matrox Millennium series of cards attracted buyers willing to pay for a higher quality and sharper display. In 1994, Matrox introduced the Matrox Impression, an add-on card that worked in conjunction with a 2d card to provide 3D acceleration. The Impression was aimed primarily at the CAD market. In October of 1995, Matrox released the Millennium, its most venerated 2d card. A later version of the Millennium included features similar to the Impression but by this time the series was lagging behind emerging vendors like 3dfx Interactive.

Matrox made several attempts to increase its share of the market for 3D-capable cards. The Matrox Mystique, released in 1996, was the company&#x27;s first attempt to make a card with good performance in games and with pricing suitable for that market. The product had good 2D and 3D performance but produced poor 3D images with the result that it was derided in reviews, being compared unfavorably with the Voodoo1 and even being nicknamed the &quot;Matrox Mystake&quot;.
Another attempt was the Matrox G100 and G200. The G200 was sold as two models, the Millennium G200 was a higher-end version typically equipped with 8 MB SGRAM memory, while the Mystique G200 used slower SDRAM memory but added a TV-out port. The G200 offered competent 3D performance for the first time, but was released shortly before a new generation of cards from Nvidia and ATI which completely outperformed it. Later versions in the Matrox G400 series were never able to regain the crown, and despite huge claims for the Matrox Parhelia, their performance continued to be quickly outpaced by the major players.

Since then, Matrox has continued to shift the focus of its card designs towards specialized, niche markets, moving more deeply into enterprise, industrial, and government applications. This includes solutions for when a large number of monitors attached to the same PC is required. In recent years they have held no more than a 3–5% share of the total video card market. Matrox is now divided into three divisions: Matrox Graphics, Matrox Video, and Matrox Imaging. Matrox Graphics is the primary consumer and end-user brand, while Matrox Video markets digital video editing solutions, and Matrox Imaging sells high-end video capture systems and &quot;smart cameras&quot;, video cameras with a built-in computer for machine vision applications.

2016, Matrox introduced the C-series of graphics cards based on GPUs from AMD. Cards are C420 LP, C680 and C900.

On September 6, 2019, the company announced that its co-founder Lorne Trottier had acquired 100% ownership of the Matrox group of companies, including its three divisions—Matrox Imaging, Matrox Graphics, and Matrox Video.

On June 6, 2022, Zebra Technologies announced they had completed their acquisition of the Matrox Imaging division.

2023 Matrox introduced the LUMA series of graphics cards based on Intel Arc GPUs from Intel.

== Driver support ==

To support Unix and Linux, Matrox has released only binary drivers for most of their product line and one partially free and open-source driver for the G550 card which comes with a binary blob to enable some additional functionality. These drivers were tested and are allegedly supported for quite old distributions. They do not work on newer Linux kernels and X.Org Server versions. In addition to the proprietary drivers provided by Matrox, the DRI community has provided drivers under the GPL license for many more of the devices.

<doc id="100472" wikidata="Q2514522" url="?curid=100472" title="Iodothyronine deiodinase">
<text>Iodothyronine deiodinases ( and ) are a subfamily of deiodinase enzymes important in the activation and deactivation of thyroid hormones. Thyroxine (T4), the precursor of 3,5,3&#x27;-triiodothyronine (T3) is transformed into T3 by deiodinase activity. T3, through binding a nuclear thyroid hormone receptor, influences the expression of genes in practically every vertebrate cell. Iodothyronine deiodinases are unusual in that these enzymes contain selenium, in the form of an otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine.

These enzymes are not to be confused with the iodotyrosine deiodinases that are also deiodinases, but not members of the iodothyronine family. The iodotyrosine deiodinases (unlike the iodothyronine deiodinases) do &quot;not&quot; use selenocysteine or selenium. The iodotyrosine enzymes work on iodinated single tyrosine residue molecules to scavenge iodine, and do not use as substrates the double-tyrosine residue molecules of the various iodothyronines.

== Activation and inactivation ==

In tissues, deiodinases can either activate or inactivate thyroid hormones:
* &quot;Activation&quot; occurs by conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) through the removal of an iodine atom on the outer ring.
* &quot;Inactivation&quot; of thyroid hormones occurs by removal of an iodine atom on the inner ring, which converts thyroxine to the inactive reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), or which converts the active triiodothyronine to diiodothyronine (T2).
The major part of thyroxine deiodination occurs within the cells.

Deiodinase 2 activity can be regulated by ubiquitination:
* The covalent attachment of ubiquitin inactivates D2 by disrupting dimerization and targets it to degradation in the proteosome.
* Deubiquitination removing ubiquitin from D2 restores its activity and prevents proteosomal degradation.
* The Hedgehog cascade acts to increase D2 ubiquitination through WSB1 activity, decreasing D2 activity.

D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thereby blocking the conversion of T4 to T3, providing some though minimal therapeutic effect.

== Reactions ==
== Structure ==

The three deiodinase enzymes share certain structural features in common although their sequence identity is lower than 50%. Each enzyme weighs between 29 and 33kDa. Deiodinases are dimeric integral membrane proteins with single transmembrane segments and large globular heads (see below). They share a TRX fold that contains the active site including the rare selenocysteine amino acid and two histidine residues. Selenocysteine is coded by a UGA codon, which generally signifies termination of a peptide through a stop codon. In point mutation experiments with Deiodinase 1 changing UGA to the stop codon TAA resulted in a complete loss of function, while changing UGA to cysteine (TGT) caused the enzyme to operate at around 10% normal efficiency. In order for UGA to be read as a selenocysteine amino acid instead of a stop codon, it is necessary that a downstream stem loop sequence, the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS), be present to bind with SECIS binding protein-2 (SBP-2), which binds with elongation factor EFsec. The translation of selenocysteine is not efficient, even though it is important to the functioning of the enzyme. Deiodinase 2 is localized to the ER membrane while Deiodinase 1 and 3 are found in the plasma membrane.

The related catalytic domains of Deiodinases 1-3 feature a thioredoxine-related peroxiredoxin fold. The enzymes catalyze a reductive elimination of iodine, thereby oxidizing themselves similar to Prx, followed by a reductive recycling of the enzyme.

== Types ==

In most vertebrates, there are three types of enzymes that can deiodinate thyroid hormones:

== Function ==

Deiodinase 1 both activates T4 to produce T3 and inactivates T4. Besides its increased function in producing extrathyroid T3 in patients with hyperthyroidism, its function is less well understood than D2 or D3 Deiodinase 2, located in the ER membrane, converts T4 into T3 and is a major source of the cytoplasmic T3 pool. Deiodinase 3 prevents T4 activation and inactivates T3. D2 and D3 are important in homeostatic regulation in maintaining T3 levels at the plasma and cellular levels. In hyperthyroidism D2 is down regulated and D3 is upregulated to clear extra T3, while in hypothyroidism D2 is upregulated and D3 is downregulated to increase cytoplasmic T3 levels.

Serum T3 levels remain fairly constant in healthy individuals, but D2 and D3 can regulate tissue specific intracellular levels of T3 to maintain homeostasis since T3 and T4 levels may vary by organ. Deiodinases also provide spatial and temporal developmental control of thyroid hormone levels. D3 levels are highest early in development and decrease over time, while D2 levels are high at moments of significant metamorphic change in tissues. Thus D2 enables production of sufficient T3 at necessary time points while D3 may shield tissue from overexposure to T3.

Also, iodothyronine deiodinases (type 2 y 3; DIO2 and DIO3, respectively) respond to seasonal changes in photoperiod-driven melatonin secretion and govern peri-hypothalamic catabolism of the prohormone thyroxine (T4). In long summer days, the production of hypothalamic T3 increase due to DIO-2-mediated conversion of T4 to the biologically active hormone. This process allows to active anabolic neuroendocrine pathways that maintain reproductive competence and increase body weight. However, during the adaptation to reproductively inhibitory photoperiods, the levels of T3 decrease due to peri-hypothalamic DIO3 expression that catabolizes T4 and T3 into receptor inactive amines.

Deiodinase 2 also plays a significant role in thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In response to sympathetic stimulation, dropping temperature, or overfeeding BAT, D2 increases oxidation of fatty acids and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation via uncoupling protein, causing mitochondrial heat production. D2 increases during cold stress in BAT and increases intracellular T3 levels. In D2 deficient models, shivering is a behavioral adaptation to the cold. However, heat production is much less efficient than uncoupling lipid oxidation.

== Disease relevance ==

In cardiomyopathy the heart reverts to a fetal gene programming due to the overload of the heart. Like during fetal development, thyroid hormone levels are low in the overloaded heart tissue in a local hypothyroid state, with low levels of deiodinase 1 and deiodinase 2. Although deiodinase 3 levels in a normal heart are generally low, in cardiomyopathy deiodinase 3 activity is increased to decrease energy turnover and oxygen consumption.

Hypothyroidism is a disease diagnosed by decreased levels of serum thyroxine (T4). Presentation in adults leads to decreased metabolism, increased weight gain, and neuropsychiatric complications. During development, hypothyroidism is considered more severe and leads to neurotoxicity as cretinism or other human cognitive disorders, altered metabolism and underdeveloped organs. Medication and environmental exposures can result in hypothyroidism with changes in deiodinase enzyme activity. The drug iopanoic acid (IOP) decreased cutaneous cell proliferation by inhibition of deiodinase enzyme type 1 or 2 reducing the conversion of T4 to T3. The environmental chemical DE-71, a PBDE pentaBDE brominated flame retardant decreased hepatic deiodinase I transcription and enzyme activity in neonatal rats with hypothyroidism.

== Quantifying enzyme activity ==

&quot;In vitro&quot;, including cell culture experiments, deiodination activity is determined by incubating cells or homogenates with high amounts of labeled thyroxine (T4) and required cosubstrates. As a measure of deiodination, the production of radioactive iodine and other physiological metabolites, in particular T3 or reverse T3, are determined and expressed (e.g. as fmol/mg protein/minute).

&quot;In vivo&quot;, deiodination activity is estimated from equilibrium levels of free T3 and free T4. A simple approximation is T3/T4 ratio, a more elaborate approach is calculating sum activity of peripheral deiodinases (SPINA-GD) from free T4, free T3 and parameters for protein binding, dissociation and hormone kinetics. In atypical cases, this last approach can benefit from measurements of TBG, but usually only requires measurement of TSH, fT3 and fT4, and as such has no added laboratory requirements besides the measurement of the same.

<text>Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen (30 July 1878 – 12 August 1964) was a Danish engineer and industrialist.

==Life==
The son of a shipmaster who died when Rasmussen was still a young child, he attended middle school in Nakskov and in 1894 began an apprenticeship in Copenhagen. His mother died when he was 19, he then moved to Nykøbing where he continued his training mployed by a local engine maker.

In 1898 Rasmussen moved to Germany in order to take classes in mechanical and electrical engineering at the &quot;Hochschule Mittweida&quot; university of applied sciences in Saxony. However, he was relegated two years later due to inadequate academic achievements and continued his studies at the newly established University of Applied Sciences of Zwickau where he took his exams in 1902. One year later he registered his first utility model (&quot;Gebrauchsmuster&quot;) on a turning tool in Zwickau.

Rasmussen established the DKW motorcycle manufacturing factory Zschopauer Motorenwerke in 1921 and later automobile Framo. Rasmussen acquired a majority interest in Audi Automobilwerke in 1928, which four years later became Auto Union AG with the merger of Zschopauer Motorenwerke, Audi and others.

The Wall Street crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression hit Rasmussen&#x27;s businesses hard, as demand for motor-bikes and passenger cars slumped. In 1930 the Saxony Regional Bank, which had financed Rasmussen&#x27;s business expansion in the 1920s, installed Richard Bruhn (1886 – 1964) on the board of Audi and there followed a brutal pruning and rationalization of the various auto-businesses that Rasmussen had accumulated. The outcome was the founding of Auto Union in Summer 1932 with just four component businesses, being Audi, DKW, Horch and the car producing piece of Wanderer. The Auto Union group rapidly grew to become Germany&#x27;s second auto producer, behind only Opel in terms of passenger car market share. After World War II, DKW moved to West Germany, with the original factory becoming MZ.

Rasmussen remained on the board until 1934 when he was removed following &quot;differences&quot; with fellow board members. He then left Zwickau and purchased an estate at Sacrow which today has become a district in Potsdam, and where he lived with his family till 1945. In 1945 he joined the flight from the Soviet army, relocating to Flensburg, and in 1947 he returned to Denmark. 

From 1947 he lived in Hareskovby, where in the 1950s he built motor-bikes under the DISA name. After his 75th birthday he and his wife moved to Copenhagen.

<text>A radio-controlled model (or RC model) is a model that is steerable with the use of radio control (RC). All types of model vehicles have had RC systems installed in them, including ground vehicles, boats, planes, helicopters and even submarines and scale railway locomotives.

== History ==
World War II saw increased development in radio control technology. The Luftwaffe used controllable winged bombs for targeting Allied ships. During the 1930s the Good brothers Bill and Walt pioneered vacuum tube based control units for RC hobby use. Their &quot;Guff&quot; radio controlled plane is on display at the National Aerospace museum. Ed Lorenze published a design in Model Airplane News that was built by many hobbyists. Later, after WW2, in the late 1940s to mid 1950 many other RC designs emerged and some were sold commercially, Berkeley&#x27;s Super Aerotrol, was one such example.

Originally simple &#x27;on-off&#x27; systems, these evolved to use complex systems of relays to control a rubber powered escapement&#x27;s speed and direction. In another more sophisticated version developed by the Good brothers called TTPW, information was encoded by varying the signal&#x27;s mark/space ratio (pulse proportional). Commercial versions of these systems quickly became available. The tuned reed system brought new sophistication, using metal reeds to resonate with the transmitted signal and operate one of a number of different relays. In the 1960s the availability of transistor-based equipment led to the rapid development of fully proportional servo-based &quot;digital proportional&quot; systems, achieved initially with discrete components, again driven largely by amateurs but resulting in commercial products. In the 1970s, integrated circuits made the electronics small, light and cheap enough for the 1960s-established multi-channel digital proportional systems to become much more widely available.

In the 1990s miniaturised equipment became widely available, allowing radio control of the smallest models, and by the 2000s radio control was commonplace even for the control of inexpensive toys. At the same time the ingenuity of modellers has been sustained and the achievements of amateur modelers using new technologies has extended to such applications as gas-turbine powered aircraft, aerobatic helicopters and submarines.

Before radio control, many models would use simple burning fuses or clockwork mechanisms to control flight or sailing times. Sometimes clockwork controllers would also control and vary direction or behaviour. Other methods included tethering to a central point (popular for model cars and hydroplanes), round the pole control for electric model aircraft and control lines (called u-control in the US) for internal combustion powered aircraft.

The first general use of radio control systems in models started in the late 1940s with single-channel self-built equipment; commercial equipment came soon thereafter. Initially remote control systems used escapement, (often rubber driven) mechanical actuation in the model. Commercial sets often used ground standing transmitters, long whip antennas with separate ground poles and single vacuum tube receivers. The first kits had dual tubes for more selectivity. Such early systems were invariably super regenerative circuits, which meant that two controllers used in close proximity would interfere with one another. The requirement for heavy batteries to drive tubes also meant that model boat systems were more successful than model aircraft.

The advent of transistors greatly reduced the battery requirements, since the current requirements at low voltage were greatly reduced and the high voltage battery was eliminated. Low cost systems employed a superregenerative transistor receiver sensitive to a specific audio tone modulation, the latter greatly reducing interference from 27 MHz Citizens&#x27; band radio communications on nearby frequencies. Use of an output transistor further increased reliability by eliminating the sensitive output relay, a device subject to both motor-induced vibration and stray dust contamination.

In both tube and early transistor sets the model&#x27;s control surfaces were usually operated by an electromagnetic &quot;escapement&quot; controlling the stored energy in a rubber-band loop, allowing simple rudder control (right, left, and neutral) and sometimes other functions such as motor speed, and kick-up elevator.

In the late 1950s, RC hobbyists had mastered tricks to manage proportional control of the flight control surfaces, for example by rapidly switching on and off reed systems, a technique called &quot;skillful blipping&quot; or more humorously &quot;nervous proportional&quot;.

By the early 1960s transistors had replaced the tube and electric motors driving control surfaces were more common. The first low cost &quot;proportional&quot; systems did not use servos, but rather employed a bidirectional motor with a proportional pulse train that consisted of two tones, pulse-width modulated (TTPW). This system, and another commonly known as &quot;Kicking Duck/Galloping Ghost&quot;, was driven with a pulse train that caused the rudder and elevator to &quot;wag&quot; though a small angle (not affecting flight owing to small excursions and high speed), with the average position determined by the proportions of the pulse train. A more sophisticated and unique proportional system was developed by Hershel Toomin of Electrosolids corporation called the Space Control. This benchmark system used two tones, pulse width and rate modulated to drive 4 fully proportional servos, and was manufactured and refined by Zel Ritchie, who ultimately gave the technology to the Dunhams of Orbit in 1964. The system was widely imitated, and others (Sampey, ACL, DeeBee) tried their hand at developing what was then known as analog proportional. But these early analog proportional radios were very expensive, putting them out of the reach for most modelers. Eventually, single-channel gave way to multi channel devices (at significantly higher cost) with various audio tones driving electromagnets affecting tuned resonant reeds for channel selection.

Crystal oscillator superheterodyne receivers with better selectivity and stability made control equipment more capable and at lower cost. The constantly diminishing equipment weight was crucial to ever increasing modelling applications. Superheterodyne circuits became more common, enabling several transmitters to operate closely together and enabling further rejection of interference from adjacent Citizen&#x27;s Band voice radio bands.

Multi-channel developments were of particular use to aircraft which really needed a minimum of three control dimensions (yaw, pitch and motor speed), as opposed to boats which can be controlled with two or one. Radio control &#x27;channels&#x27; were originally outputs from a reed array, in other words, a simple on-off switch. To provide a usable control signal a control surface needs to be moved in two directions, so at least two &#x27;channels&#x27; would be needed unless a complex mechanical link could be made to provide two-directional movement from a single switch. Several of these complex links were marketed during the 1960s, including the Graupner &quot;Kinematic&quot; Orbit, Bramco, and Kraft simultaneous reed sets.

Doug Spreng is credited with developing the first &quot;digital&quot; pulse-width feedback servo and along with Don Mathis developed and sold the first digital proportional radio called the &quot;Digicon&quot; followed by Bonner&#x27;s Digimite, and Hoovers F&amp;M Digital 5.

With the electronics revolution, single-signal channel circuit design became redundant and instead, radios provided coded signal streams which a servomechanism could interpret. Each of these streams replaced two of the original &#x27;channels&#x27;, and, confusingly, the signal streams began to be called &#x27;channels&#x27;. So an old on/off 6-channel transmitter which could drive the rudder, elevator and throttle of an aircraft was replaced with a new proportional 3-channel transmitter doing the same job. Controlling all the primary controls of a powered aircraft (rudder, elevator, ailerons and throttle) was known as &#x27;full-house&#x27; control. A glider could be &#x27;full-house&#x27; with only three channels.

Soon a competitive marketplace emerged, bringing rapid development. By the 1970s the trend for &#x27;full-house&#x27; proportional radio control was fully established. Typical radio control systems for radio-controlled models employ pulse-width modulation (PWM), pulse-position modulation (PPM) and more recently spread-spectrum technology, and actuate the various control surfaces using servomechanisms. These systems made &#x27;proportional control&#x27; possible, where the position of the control surface in the model is proportional to the position of the control stick on the transmitter.

PWM is most commonly used in radio control equipment today, where transmitter controls change the width (duration) of the pulse for that channel between 920 μs and 2120 μs, 1520 μs being the center (neutral) position. The pulse is repeated in a frame of between 10 and 30 milliseconds in length. Off-the-shelf servos respond directly to servo control pulse trains of this type using integrated decoder circuits, and in response they actuate a rotating arm or lever on the top of the servo. An electric motor and reduction gearbox is used to drive the output arm and a variable component such as a resistor &quot;potentiometer&quot; or tuning capacitor. The variable capacitor or resistor produces an error signal voltage proportional to the output position which is then compared with the position commanded by the input pulse and the motor is driven until a match is obtained. The pulse trains representing the whole set of channels is easily decoded into separate channels at the receiver using very simple circuits such as a Johnson counter. The relative simplicity of this system allows receivers to be small and light, and has been widely used since the early 1970s.
Usually a single-chip 4017 decade counter is used inside the receiver to decode the transmitted multiplexed PPM signal to the individual &quot;RC PWM&quot; signals sent to each RC servo.
Often a Signetics NE544 IC or a functionally equivalent chip is used inside the housing of low-cost RC servos as the motor controller—it decodes that servo control pulse train to a position, and drives the motor to that position.

More recently, high-end hobby systems using Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) features have come on the market that provide a digital bit-stream signal to the receiving device instead of analog type pulse modulation. Advantages include bit error checking capabilities of the data stream (good for signal integrity checking) and fail-safe options including motor (if the model has a motor) throttle down and similar automatic actions based on signal loss. However, those systems that use pulse code modulation generally induce more lag due to lesser frames sent per second as bandwidth is needed for error checking bits. PCM devices can only detect errors and thus hold the last verified position or go into failsafe mode. They cannot correct transmission errors.

In the early 21st century, 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) transmissions have become increasingly utilised in high-end control of model vehicles and aircraft. This range of frequencies has many advantages. Because the 2.4 GHz wavelengths are so small (around 10 centimetres), the antennas on the receivers do not need to exceed 3 to 5 cm. Electromagnetic noise, for example from electric motors, is not &#x27;seen&#x27; by 2.4 GHz receivers due to the noise&#x27;s frequency (which tends to be around 10 to 150 MHz). The transmitter antenna only needs to be 10 to 20 cm long, and receiver power usage is much lower; batteries can therefore last longer. In addition, no crystals or frequency selection is required as the latter is performed automatically by the transmitter. However, the short wavelengths do not diffract as easily as the longer wavelengths of PCM/PPM, so &#x27;line of sight&#x27; is required between the transmitting antenna and the receiver. Also, should the receiver lose power, even for a few milliseconds, or get &#x27;swamped&#x27; by 2.4 GHz interference, it can take a few seconds for the receiver - which, in the case of 2.4 GHz, is almost invariably a digital device - to re-sync.

== Design ==
RC electronics have three essential elements. The transmitter is the controller. Transmitters have control sticks, triggers, switches, and dials at the user&#x27;s finger tips. The receiver is mounted in the model. It receives and processes the signal from the transmitter, translating it into signals that are sent to the servos and speed controllers. The number of servos in a model determines the number of channels the radio must provide.

Typically the transmitter multiplexes and modulates the signal into pulse-position modulation. The receiver demodulates and demultiplexes the signal and translates it into the special kind of pulse-width modulation used by standard RC servos and controllers.

In the 1980s, a Japanese electronics company, Futaba, copied wheeled steering for RC cars. It was originally developed by Orbit for a transmitter specially designed for Associated cars It has been widely accepted along with a control for throttle. Often configured for right hand users, the transmitter looks like a pistol with a wheel attached on its right side. Pulling the trigger would accelerate the car forward, while pushing it would either stop the car or cause it to go into reverse. Some models are available in left-handed versions.

== Mass production ==
There are thousands of RC vehicles available. Most are toys suitable for children. What separates toy grade RC from hobby grade RC is the modular characteristic of the standard RC equipment. RC toys generally have simplified circuits, often with the receiver and servos incorporated into one circuit. It&#x27;s almost impossible to take that particular toy circuit and transplant it into other RCs.

=== Hobby grade RC ===

Hobby grade RC systems have modular designs. Many cars, boats, and aircraft can accept equipment from different manufacturers, so it is possible to take RC equipment from a car and install it into a boat, for example.

However, moving the receiver component between aircraft and surface vehicles is illegal in most countries as radio frequency laws allocate separate bands for air and surface models. This is done for safety reasons.

Most manufacturers now offer &quot;frequency modules&quot; (known as crystals) that simply plug into the back of their transmitters, allowing one to change frequencies, and even bands, at will. Some of these modules are capable of &quot;synthesizing&quot; many different channels within their assigned band.

Hobby grade models can be fine tuned, unlike most toy grade models. For example, cars often allow toe-in, camber and caster angle adjustments, just like their real-life counterparts. All modern &quot;computer&quot; radios allow each function to be adjusted over several parameters for ease in setup and adjustment of the model. Many of these transmitters are capable of &quot;mixing&quot; several functions at once, which is required for some models.

Many of the most popular hobby grade radios were first developed, and mass-produced in Southern California by Orbit, Bonner, Kraft, Babcock, Deans, Larson, RS, S&amp;O, and Milcott. Later, Japanese companies like Futaba, Sanwa and JR took over the market.

== Types ==

=== Aircraft ===
Radio-controlled aircraft (also called RC aircraft) are small aircraft that can be controlled remotely. There are many different types, ranging from small park flyers to large jets and mid-sized aerobatic models.
The aircraft use many different methods of propulsion, ranging from brushed or brushless electric motors, to internal combustion engines, to the most expensive gas turbines. The fastest aircraft, dynamic slope soarers, can reach speeds of over by dynamic soaring, repeatedly circling through the gradient of wind speeds over a ridge or slope. Newer jets can achieve above in a short distance.

===Tanks===
Radio-controlled tanks are replicas of armored fighting vehicles that can move, rotate the turret and some even shoot all by using the hand-held transmitter. Radio-controlled tanks are produced in numerous scale size for commercial offerings like:

1/35th scale. Probably the best known make in this scale is by Tamiya.

1/24 scale. This scale often includes a mounted Airsoftgun, the possibly the best offering is by Tokyo-Marui, but there are imitations by Heng Long, who offer cheap remakes of the tanks. The downsides to the Heng Long imitations are that they were standardized to their Type 90 tank which has 6 road wheels, then they produced a Leopard 2 and M1A2 Abrams on the same chassis but both of the tanks have 7 road wheels.

1/16 scale is the more intimidating vehicle design scale. Tamiya produce some of the best of this scale, these usually include realistic features like flashing lights, engine sounds, main gun recoil and - on their Leopard 2A6 - an optional gyro-stabilization system for the gun. Chinese manufacturers such as (Heng Long and Matorro) also produce a variety of high-quality 1/16 tanks and other AFVs.

Both the Tamiya and the Heng Long vehicles can make use of an Infra Red battle system, which attaches a small IR &quot;gun&quot; and target to the tanks, allowing them to engage in direct battle.

As with cars, tanks can come from ready to run to a full assembly kit.

In more private offerings there are 1/6 and 1/4 scale vehicles available. The largest RC tank available anywhere in the world is the King tiger in 1/4 scale, over long. These GRP fiberglass tanks were originally created and produced by Alex Shlakhter.

=== Cars ===

A radio-controlled car is a powered model car driven from a distance. Gasoline, nitro-methanol and electric cars exist, designed to be run both on and off-road. &quot;Gas&quot; cars traditionally use petrol (gasoline), though many hobbyists run &#x27;nitro&#x27; cars, using a mixture of methanol and nitromethane, to get their power.

=== Logistic ===

Logistic RC model include the following, Tractor unit, Semi-trailer truck, Semi-trailer, Terminal tractor, Refrigerator truck, Forklift truck, Empty Container handlers, and Reach stacker. Most of them are in 1:14 and run on electric motors.

=== Helicopters ===

Radio-controlled helicopters, although often grouped with RC aircraft, are unique because of the differences in construction, aerodynamics and flight training. Several designs of RC helicopters exist, some with limited maneuverability (and thus easier to learn to fly), and those with more maneuverability (and thus harder to learn to fly).

=== Boats ===

Radio-controlled boats are model boats controlled remotely with radio control equipment. The main types of RC boat are: scale models (12 inches (30 cm) – 144&quot; (365 cm) in size), the sailing boat and the power boat. The latter is the more popular amongst toy grade models. Radio controlled models were used for the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Theodore Tugboat&quot;.

Out of radio-controlled model boats sprang up a new hobby—gas-powered model boating.

Radio-controlled, gasoline-powered model boats first appeared in 1962 designed by engineer Tom Perzinka of Octura Models. The gas model boats were powered with O&amp;R (Ohlsson and Rice) small 20 cc ignition gasoline utility engines. This was a completely new concept in the early years of available radio-control systems. The boat was called the &quot;White Heat&quot; and was a hydro design, meaning it had more than one wetted surface.

Towards the late 1960s and early 1970s another gasoline-powered model was created and powered with a similar chainsaw engine. This boat was named &quot;The Moppie&quot; after its full-size counterpart. Again like the White Heat, between the costs of production, engine, and radio equipment, the project failed at market and perished.

By 1970, nitro (glow ignition) power became the norm for model boating.

In 1982 Tony Castronovo, a hobbyist in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, marketed the first production gasoline string trimmer engine powered (22 cc gasoline ignition engine) radio-controlled model boat in a 44-inch vee-bottom boat. It achieved a top speed of 30 miles per hour. The boat was marketed under the trade name &quot;Enforcer&quot; and sold by his company Warehouse Hobbies, Inc. The following years of marketing and distribution aided the spread of gasoline-powered model boating throughout the US, Europe, Australia, and many countries around the world.

As of 2010, gasoline radio-controlled model boating has grown worldwide. The industry has spawned many manufacturers and thousands of model boaters. Today the average gasoline-powered boat can easily run at speeds over 45 mph, with the more exotic gas boats running at speeds exceeding 90 mph. This year also saw ML Boatworks develop laser cut wood scale hydroplane racing kits that rejuvenated a sector of the hobby that was turning to composite boats, instead of the classic art of building wood models. These kits also gave fast electric modelers a platform much needed in the hobby.

Many of Tony Castronovo&#x27;s designs and innovations in gasoline model boating are the foundation upon which the industry has been built. He was first to introduce surface drive on a Vee hull (propeller hub above the water line) to model boating which he named &quot;SPD&quot; (surface planing drive) as well as numerous products and developments relative to gasoline-powered model boating. He and his company continue to produce gasoline-powered model boats and components.

=== Submarines ===

Radio-controlled submarines can range from inexpensive toys to complex projects involving sophisticated electronics. Oceanographers and the Military also operate radio control submarines.

=== Combat robotics ===

The majority of robots used in shows such as Battlebots and Robot Wars are remotely controlled, relying on most of the same electronics as other radio-controlled vehicles. They are frequently equipped with weapons for the purpose of damaging opponents, including but not limited to hammering axes, &quot;flippers&quot; and spinners.

== Power ==

=== Internal combustion ===
Internal combustion engines for remote control models have typically been two stroke engines that run on specially blended fuel. Engine sizes are typically given in cm3 or cubic inches, ranging from tiny engines like these .02 in3 to huge 1.60 in3 or larger. For even larger sizes, many modelers turn to four stroke or gasoline engines (see below.) Glow plug engines have an ignition device that possesses a platinum wire coil in the glow plug, that catalytically glows in the presence of the methanol in glow engine fuel, providing the combustion source.

Since 1976, practical &quot;glow&quot; ignition four stroke model engines have been available on the market, ranging in size from 3.5 cm3 upwards to 35 cm3 in single cylinder designs. Various twin and multi-cylinder glow ignition four stroke model engines are also available, echoing the appearance of full sized radial, inline and opposed cylinder aircraft powerplants. The multi-cylinder models can become enormous, such as the Saito five cylinder radial. They tend to be quieter in operation than two stroke engines, using smaller mufflers, and also use less fuel.

Glow engines tend to produce large amounts of oily mess due to the oil in the fuel. They are also much louder than electric motors.

Another alternative is the gasoline engine. While glow engines run on special and expensive hobby fuel, gasoline runs on the same fuel that powers cars, lawnmowers, weed whackers etc. These typically run on a two-stroke cycle, but are radically different from glow two-stroke engines. They are typically much, much larger, like the 80 cm3 Zenoah. These engines can develop several horsepower, incredible for something that can be held in the palm of the hand.

=== Electrical ===
Electric power is often the chosen form of power for aircraft, cars and boats. Electric power in aircraft in particular has become popular recently, mainly due to the popularity of park flyers and the development of technologies like brushless motors and lithium polymer batteries. These allow electric motors to produce much more power rivaling that of fuel-powered engines. It is also relatively simple to increase the torque of an electric motor at the expense of speed, while it is much less common to do so with a fuel engine, perhaps due to its roughness. This permits a more efficient larger-diameter propeller to be used which provides more thrust at lower airspeeds. (e.g. an electric glider climbing steeply to a good thermalling altitude.)

In aircraft, cars, trucks and boats, glow and gas engines are still used even though electric power has been the most common form of power for a while. The following picture shows a typical brushless motor and speed controller used with radio controlled cars. As you can see, due to the integrated heat sink, the speed controller is almost as large as the motor itself. Due to size and weight limitations, heat sinks are not common in RC aircraft electronic speed controller (ESCs), therefore the ESC is almost always smaller than the motor.

== Controlling methods ==

Remote Control:

Most RC models make use of a handheld remote device with an antenna that sends signals to the vehicle&#x27;s IR receiver. There are 2 different sticks. On the left is the stick to change the altitude of a flying vehicle or move a ground vehicle in forward or reverse . Sometimes the stick in flying model controllers can stay wherever the finger places it or it has to be held since underneath is a spring causing it to move back to its neutral position once released by the finger. Generally, in remotes used for ground moving RC vehicles the left stick&#x27;s neutral position is in the centre. The right stick is for moving the flying vehicle around in the air in different directions and with grounds vehicles it is for steering. On the controller is also a trimmer setting which helps in keeping the vehicle focused in one direction. Mostly low grade RC vehicles will include a charging cable inside the remote with a green light indicating that the battery is in charge.

Phone and tablet control:

With the influence of touch screen devices mostly phones and tablets many RC vehicles can be controlled from any Apple or Android devices. On the operating system store is an app specifically for that particular RC model. The controls are almost identical to those on a physically used remote control when using virtual remote control but sometimes can vary from an actual controller depending on the type of vehicle. The device is not included with the vehicle set but the box does come with a radio chip to insert into the headset slot of any smartphone or tablet.

<doc id="100487" wikidata="Q238410" url="?curid=100487" title="Jennifer Warnes">
<text>Jennifer Jean Warnes (born March 3, 1947) is an American singer and songwriter who has performed as a vocalist on a number of film soundtracks. She has won two Grammy Awards, in 1983 for the Joe Cocker duet &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;, and in 1987 for the Bill Medley duet &quot;(I&#x27;ve Had) The Time of My Life&quot;. Warnes also collaborated closely with Leonard Cohen.

==Early life==
Warnes was born on March 3, 1947, in Seattle, Washington, but raised in Anaheim, California. Her desire and ability to sing came early; at age seven she was offered her first recording contract, which her father declined. She sang in church and local pageants until age 17, when Warnes was offered an opera scholarship to Immaculate Heart College. She was so committed to her Catholic faith that for a while she entered a convent after graduating from high school.

Warnes chose to sing folk music as it became popularized by Joan Baez in the mid-1960s. In 1968, after a few years with musical theatre and clubs, she signed with Parrot Records (a London Records subsidiary) and recorded her first album. That year, she joined the cast of the television show &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;.

Early in her career, industry advisors suggested Warnes change her name to &quot;Warren&quot;, but then realized that there was already an actress named Jennifer Warren, so she performed briefly as simply &#x27;Jennifer&#x27;, though she was credited as Jennifer Warren when she provided duet vocals for singer-guitarist Mason Williams on his 1968 album, &quot;The Mason Williams Ear Show&quot;. Soon, however, she returned to her birth name.

In November 1968, Warnes (as &quot;Jennifer Warren&quot;) portrayed the female lead in the Los Angeles, California, production of the stage musical &quot;Hair&quot;. She had a related UK single release as &quot;Jennifer&quot; on London HLU 10278 in June 1969 with &quot;Let The Sunshine In&quot; and &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot;, licensed from the US Parrot label. Her fellow &quot;Hair&quot; castmate Bert Sommer wrote a song inspired by her entitled &quot;Jennifer,&quot; and performed it at Woodstock.

==Career==
===1970s===
In 1971, Warnes met Canadian songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen, and the two remained friends. She toured Europe with Cohen&#x27;s band in 1972 and 1979 — first as a back-up singer and then as a vocal arranger and guest singer on Cohen&#x27;s albums &quot;Live Songs&quot; (1973), &quot;Recent Songs&quot; (1979), &quot;Various Positions&quot; (1985), &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; (1988), &quot;The Future&quot; (1992), &quot;Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979&quot; (2001), and &quot;Old Ideas&quot; (2012). Warnes also recorded a critically acclaimed album of Cohen songs, &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot;, in 1987.

In 1972, Warnes released her third album, &quot;Jennifer&quot;, which was produced by John Cale. It was unavailable after the LP was deleted, until it was finally reissued in Japan in 2013 (Reprise WPCR-14865). In 1976, Warnes released the album &quot;Jennifer Warnes&quot; (Arista 4062), which contained her breakthrough single, &quot;Right Time of the Night&quot;, which hit number 1 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Easy Listening (Adult Contemporary) chart in April 1977 and number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in May 1977.

Warnes recorded the song &quot;It Goes Like It Goes&quot; for the 1979 motion picture &quot;Norma Rae&quot;. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Her 1979 single &quot;I Know A Heartache When I See One&quot;, was a Top 10 Country hit and reached the Top 20 on both the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts.

===1980s===
Warnes recorded the Randy Newman composition &quot;One More Hour&quot; for the 1981 motion picture &quot;Ragtime&quot;. This became her second song performance nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

Warnes teamed up with Joe Cocker to record &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; for the 1982 motion picture &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;. Written by Buffy Sainte-Marie, Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche, the song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as a Golden Globe Award. The song also won Warnes and Cocker the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, which was released as a single and hit No. 1 (for three weeks running) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It was certified platinum for over two million sales in the United States. That same year, she recorded James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Millworker&quot; for the &quot;American Playhouse&quot; PBS production of &quot;Working&quot;.

In 1985, she recorded a duet version with B. J. Thomas of the song &quot;As Long As We Got Each Other&quot;, the theme for the TV show &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. It was used as the opening theme for the second and third seasons. For the fourth season, the song was once again re-recorded with Thomas and Dusty Springfield. However, the Warnes version made its return for the fifth season and the seventh (final) season of the show. The same year, she recorded vocals for Leonard Cohen&#x27;s record &quot;Various Positions&quot;, getting equal vocals credits with Cohen in the inside booklet. After releasing a praised tribute LP of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s songs in 1987, &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot;, to which Cohen contributed two new compositions, &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot;, which featured Stevie Ray Vaughan on guitar, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Cure for Love&quot;, she contributed vocals to Cohen&#x27;s 1988 hit LP &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;, most notably to &quot;Take This Waltz&quot; and &quot;Tower of Song&quot;.

Warnes teamed with Bill Medley to record &quot;(I&#x27;ve Had) The Time of My Life&quot; for the 1987 motion picture &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;. This marked the third song performed by Warnes to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song and second for the Golden Globe Award in the same category. The song also won Warnes and Medley the Grammy Award for Duo or Group with Vocal. It reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and spent four consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

On September 30, 1987, at the Coconut Grove in Los Angeles, she contributed vocals for Roy Orbison&#x27;s star-studded television special &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night&quot;.

===1990s to present===
In 1991, Warnes recorded the Lennon-McCartney song &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; as a duet with Jackson Browne, included in the album &quot;For Our Children&quot; which was released by Disney as a benefit for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation.

Warnes released her seventh studio album, &quot;The Hunter&quot;, in June 1992. The LP featured the AC No. 13 single &quot;Rock You Gently&quot;, and also featured the track &quot;Way Down Deep&quot; co-written by Warnes and Leonard Cohen. She recorded the track &quot;Cold Enough To Snow&quot; for the 1993 film, &quot;Life With Mikey&quot;.

In August 2007, the Shout Factory Records label re-released the 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; with a 24-page booklet and four additional songs. &quot;The Hunter&quot; was re-released in 2009, and &quot;The Well&quot; was re-released in September 2010.

All remasters were issued on high quality vinyl and 24K gold discs. &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; was released with four bonus tracks. &quot;The Hunter&quot; was released without bonus material. The re-released &quot;The Well,&quot; however, contains a total of 14 tracks. These include two previously unreleased recordings from the original session: &quot;La Luna Brilla&quot;, &quot;A Fool for the Look (in Your Eyes)&quot;, and one extra bonus selection, &quot;Show Me the Light&quot; (a second duet with Bill Medley, which was originally featured on the 1998 movie soundtrack &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer-The Movie&quot;).

In 2018, Warnes released her first album since 2001, &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot;. The first cut from the new album, &quot;Just Breathe&quot; was released on March 1, 2018. Written by Eddie Vedder, the song was originally recorded by Pearl Jam. The album includes 10 tracks, among them a new version of &quot;So Sad&quot; by Mickey Newbury, &quot;I Am The Big Easy&quot; by Ray Bonneville, &quot;Once I Was Loved&quot; by John Legend, &quot;Why Worry&quot; by Mark Knopfler, and &quot;The Boys And Me&quot; by Warnes herself and Michael Smotherman.

<text>The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE; English: International Exhibitions Bureau) is an intergovernmental organization created to supervise international exhibitions (also known as expos, global expos or world expos) falling under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Convention Relating to International Exhibitions&quot;.

== Founding and purpose ==
The BIE was established by the Convention Relating to International Exhibitions, signed in Paris on 22 November 1928, with the following goals:
*to oversee the calendar, the bidding, the selection and the organization of World Expositions; and
*to establish a regulatory framework under which Expo organizers and participants may work together under the best conditions.

Today, 184 member countries have adhered to the BIE Convention.

The BIE regulates two types of expositions: Registered Exhibitions (commonly called World Expos) and Recognized Exhibitions (commonly called Specialized Expositions). Horticultural Exhibitions with an A1 grade, regulated by the International Association of Horticultural Producers, are recognized since 1960.

The Bureau International des Expositions also recognises the Milan Triennial Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture, on grounds of historical precedence, provided that it retains its original features.

== Expo categories ==
=== History ===
Since the creation of the BIE in 1928, different protocols have governed Expo categories, which are generally split between World Expos and Specialised Expos. The rules for each category define the duration, the frequency, the size, and the construction attributes of each Expo.

Under the original protocol of the 1928 Paris Convention, the BIE recognised two types of Expos:

* General Exhibitions (also known as World Expos), which were divided into:
** 1st category
** 2nd category 
* Special Exhibitions (also known as Specialised Expos)

The Protocol of 30 November 1972 revised the original Convention, entering into force in 1980. Under these new rules, two types of Expos were recognised:
* World Exhibitions (also known as World Expos)
* Specialised Exhibitions (also known as Specialised Expos)

A new amendment was adopted in 1988 and ratified in 1996, further distinguishing the two types of Expos:
* International Registered Exhibitions (commonly referred to as World Expos)
* International Recognised Exhibitions (commonly referred to as Specialised Expos)

Expo 2008 in Zaragoza was the first Specialised Expo to be organised under these new rules, which continue to be in force to this day.

The BIE may also grant recognition to A1 Horticultural Exhibitions approved by the International Association of Horticultural Producers (AIPH) since 1960, and to the Triennale di Milano since 1933.

=== World Expos ===
According to the 1988 Amendment of the Convention on International Exhibitions, World Expos (formally known as International Registered Exhibitions) may occur every five years, and may last up to six months. Countries, international organizations, civil societies, and corporations are allowed to participate in World Expos. The themes of World Expos address a universal challenge facing humanity, and international participants may design and build their own pavilions. Participants may also opt to customise a pavilion provided by the Organiser or to participate within a joint pavilion, which has lower participation costs. Examples of themes of recent World Expos include &quot;Man and His World&quot; for Expo &#x27;67 in Montreal, and &quot;Age of Discoveries&quot; for Seville Expo &#x27;92, and examples of joint pavilion buildings for a Registered Exposition is the Plaza of America at Seville&#x27;s Expo &#x27;92, which was constructed by the Seville Expo Authority to maximize participation at the World Expo by South American nations. The Plaza of Africa at Seville was constructed for the same purpose.

World Expos are also massive in scale, sometimes 300 or 400 hectares in size (Montreal&#x27;s Expo 67 was 410 hectares, Osaka&#x27;s Expo 70 was 330 hectares, Seville&#x27;s Expo &#x27;92 was 215 hectares and Shanghai&#x27;s Expo 2010, 528 hectares). Pavilions participating at a World Expo can also be large, sometimes 5,000 to 10,000 square metres in size, mini city blocks in themselves and sometimes more than several stories in height. (The Australia Pavilion for Shanghai 2010 was 5,000 square metres, the British Pavilion sat on a 6,000 square metres lot, as did the Canadian Pavilion. The flagship Chinese National Pavilion had 20,000 square metres of exhibition space.)

World Expos have been known to average 200,000 persons per day of visitors and some 50 to 70 million visitors during their six-month duration. Montreal&#x27;s Expo 67 attracted 54 million visitors, Osaka&#x27;s Expo &#x27;70, 64 million visitors, the Seville Expo &#x27;92, 41 million visitors and Shanghai&#x27;s Expo 2010 attracted 70 million visitors.

As a result, transport and other infrastructure at a Registered Exposition is an important concern (Seville&#x27;s World Expo of 1992 boasted cable car, monorail, boat, and bus) and the overall cost for hosting and being represented at a World Expos is quite high, compared to the smaller-scale Specialised Expos.

=== Specialised Expos ===
Specialised Expos (formally known as International Recognised Exhibitions) may occur between World Expos and may have a duration of between three weeks and three months. Countries, international organizations, civil societies, and corporations are allowed to participate but the theme of the Expo must address a precise challenge, e.g. Future Energy (Expo 2017 Astana), or Living Oceans and the Coast (Expo 2012 Yeosu). The pavilions are built by the Organiser and made available to participants who may customise them. The largest pavilion may be no larger than 1,000 square meters, and the Expo site must not exceed an area of twenty-five hectares. For this reason Specialised Expos are cheaper to run than World Expos.

There are blurred lines between Specialized and World Expositions prior to the 1996 amendment of the BIE&#x27;s constitution. Some Specialized Expos, such as Expo 86 in Vancouver, Expo &#x27;85 in Tsukuba, or Hemisfair &#x27;68, ran for six months and pulled in greater attendance numbers than their &#x27;World Expo&#x27; relatives. Many of these specialized expos also had individual pavilions for their participants or covered a greater exhibition site than other World Expos of the era. According to the new amendment, there were only two World Expos between 1970 and 1992 with over 12 Specialized Expos in that same period. Most of these indeed are smaller exhibitions on a focused theme, but some, such as Expo 86 and Expo 88, were intended as full-fledged World Expos. Others, such as Expo 74, the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville, or Expo &#x27;85, were specialized exhibitions that were promoted as full World Expos.

=== Former members ===
==== Australia ====
Australia was a signatory to the treaty and won the right to hold the 1988 World Exposition. In 2015 the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry requested that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia) reconsider membership, as the cost was too high and &quot;difficult to demonstrate an appropriate return on investment&quot;, and that membership be withdrawn temporarily in 2015. Australia is no longer listed as a member of BIE.

==== Canada ====
On 16 October 2012, the Conservative government ended Canada&#x27;s membership of the BIE when the federal government cancelled its $25,000 per year membership fee as part of &quot;reviewing all spending across government with the aim of reducing the deficit and returning to balanced budgets&quot;.

=== Rejoined members ===

==== United States (non-member 2001–2017) ====
Five International Exhibitions have been sanctioned by the BIE in the United States since World War II: one in the World Expo category—the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle (1962)—and four in the Specialized Expo category—HemisFair &#x27;68 in San Antonio; Expo &#x27;74 in Spokane, Washington; the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee; and the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans. The 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair was held without receiving approval from the BIE.

The United States&#x27; membership in the BIE was revoked in June 2001 due to non-allocation of funds by the U.S. Congress for two years. The withdrawal of the United States from the BIE had a limited impact on the BIE and on the participation of the United States in International Exhibitions: the country hosted pavilions at World Expo 2005 in Aichi Prefecture, Japan; World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China; Specialised Expo 2012 in Yeosu, South Korea; and World Expo 2015 in Milan, Italy. However, the withdrawal &quot;had strong, adverse consequences for states and localities that wish to host an exposition on U.S. soil. Organizers in at least four states have prepared bids, or are exploring the possibility of preparing bids to host a BIE-affiliated expo.&quot; In each case, the bid project was unsuccessful, with non-membership of the BIE hurting the chances of a U.S. bid moving forward.

The U.S. rejoined the organization on 10 May 2017 after President Trump signed the &quot;U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act&quot; (HR534) into law (Pub.L. 115-32) as Minnesota was looking to host a Specialized Expo in 2023.

== Expo mascots ==
Fictional characters serving as mascots have been used since 1984, starting with Seymore D. Fair as the official mascot of the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition (the name being a pun on &quot;see more of the fair&quot;, stemming from the local New Orleans dialect). Seymore D. Fair was followed by many more character mascots over the years, including Curro in Seville Expo &#x27;92; Twipsy at Expo 2000 in Hanover; and Haibao at Expo 2010 in Shanghai. The names and designs of Expo mascots are often intended to reflect the exposition&#x27;s host city in some way.

== Symbols ==

The anthem of the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) is the starting part of the 4th Movement of Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 in E Minor &quot;From the New World&quot;.

<text>Derbyshire Wildlife Trust is one of 46 local Wildlife Trusts around the UK working to promote and protect local wildlife. It covers the whole of Derbyshire and was founded in 1962 in response to environmental threats to the local countryside, since when it has continued to grow. The trust is now based at East Mill on the River Derwent in the town of Belper, Derbyshire. It is a registered charity (number 222212), supported by more than 14,000 members and over 500 volunteers.

The trust manages over 50 nature reserves, covering various habitat types. Sixteen of these are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Derbyshire Wildlife Trust provides community training, activities, and environmental education. It also provides ecological surveys, advice and data to landowners and organisations. Environmental education and workshops are provided at the Whistlestop Centre in Matlock Bath, and the Wildlife Discovery Room at Carsington Water.

== History ==
The trust originated in 1962 as Derbyshire Naturalists&#x27; Trust.

In the early 1960s a group of concerned people gathered together to oppose plans to tip fly ash at Ticknall Limeyards in South Derbyshire. Backed by national pressure, they were successful and decided to form a local charitable organisation to handle such issues. Derbyshire Naturalists&#x27; Trust was officially launched.

By 1967, the trust had established two nature reserves, one of them at Ticknall Limeyards itself. The other, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) at Morley Brickyards, was leased to the trust by its owner and is still being managed as a nature reserve. The trust also acquired Overdale, the first nature reserve that it owned outright. The of upland pasture were donated by Portland Cement to mark European Conservation Year. A bequest allowed the Trust to appoint its first member of staff in 1973.

As the trust grew, it was able to campaign more effectively, and in 1984 hit the national headlines when it won a private prosecution against five men caught badger digging.

After rebranding to become Derbyshire Wildlife Trust in 1986, the organisation became the focus of attention again the following year when it launched an appeal to raise £200,000 to renovate the old railway station buildings at Matlock Bath and create the Whistlestop Countryside Centre, an education facility in the old railway station buildings at Matlock Bath. Later in the decade a major Heritage Lottery Fund award enabled them to develop more nature reserves work and set up a Midweek Volunteer Team.

Since 2006, the trust has launched and developed a variety of projects aimed at protecting and raising awareness of vulnerable species and habitats. These include Derby Cathedral&#x27;s Peregrines Project, Great Trees of Derbyshire and Saving the Great Trees of Derbyshire - projects which have raised awareness of the importance of ancient trees - and Water for Wildlife, which has helped to restore wetland habitats. 

In 2007, the Avenue Washlands Nature Reserve near Chesterfield was opened and won first place in the Conservation category for Restoration Sites in the British Trust for Ornithology&#x27;s Business Bird Challenge. In the same year, a lottery grant allowed the trust to extend its educational programme with Grounds for a Change, transforming Derbyshire school grounds into wildlife havens and outdoor learning spaces. It also took over management of Drakelow Nature Reserve in the south of the county, an important wetland site playing host to over 200 species of birds.

In early 2024, Derbyshire Wildlife Trust purchased 83-acre site Common Farm in Nether Heage to be managed as a nature reserve, following a successful fundraising campaign. 

== Organisation ==
Derbyshire Wildlife Trust is governed by a board of trustees, elected from and by the 14,000+ members, employing around 26 members of experienced staff for management and to carry out conservation and education projects. The trust relies heavily on volunteer work for help with aspects such as managing nature reserves, administration, and education work, with around 500 active volunteers.

== Notable projects ==

=== Derby Cathedral Peregrine Watch Project ===
The Derby Cathedral Peregrine Project was launched in 2006, with the construction of a nesting platform for a pair of falcons which had unsuccessfully bred at the cathedral for two consecutive years. Subsequent years have been successful, and the project began to include webcams, blogging, and viewing events set up for members of the public to be able to view the birds through telescopes.

=== Badger Vaccination Scheme ===
Derbyshire Wildlife Trust runs the largest badger vaccination project in the country, vaccinating over 1,700 badgers since 2014.

=== Bringing Back Beavers ===
The trust successfully reintroduced a pair of Eurasian beavers to Willington Wetlands in 2021. The pair subsequently bred in 2022; this was the first wild breeding pair in Derbyshire for around 800 years.

<doc id="100499" wikidata="Q1997092" url="?curid=100499" title="4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)">
<text>&quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot;, often known just as &quot;Sandy&quot;, is a 1973 song by Bruce Springsteen, originally appearing as the second song on his album &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;. It was released as a single from the album in Germany.

One of the best-known and most praised of his early efforts, the song remains one of his most popular ballads, and has been described as &quot;the perfect musical study of the Jersey Shore boardwalk culture&quot;.

== Themes and recording ==
Set on, as the title suggests, the Fourth of July in Asbury Park, New Jersey, the song is a powerful love ballad, dedicated to one Sandy and describing the depressing atmosphere that threatens to smother the love between the singer and Sandy. Locals include the &quot;stoned-out faces&quot;, &quot;switchblade lovers&quot; and &quot;the greasers&quot; who &quot;tramp the streets or get busted for sleeping on the beach all night&quot;. The singer is tired of &quot;hangin&#x27; in them dusty arcades&quot; and &quot;chasin&#x27; the factory girls&quot;.

The song begins with the line: &quot;Sandy, the fireworks are hailin&#x27; over Little Eden tonight.&quot; Writer Ariel Swartley views the song&#x27;s verses as depicting the narrator as something of an &quot;adolescent loser ... [who&#x27;s] ruining his chances with the girl: he can&#x27;t stop telling her about the humiliations, about the girls who led him on, about the waitress that got tired of him.&quot; Nevertheless, Swartley observes the choruses to be warm, immediate, and portray an irresistibly romantic atmosphere.

Van Morrison&#x27;s influence can be heard in this song, as &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; closely parallels his romanticization of Belfast in such songs as &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; and &quot;Madame George&quot; from the 1968 album, &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;.

&quot;Sandy&quot; showcases the wistful side of Springsteen; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Robert Hilburn later wrote that &quot;the verses [were] whispered as if he was singing into his girlfriend&#x27;s ear.&quot; During recording of the song for the album, Springsteen wanted a children&#x27;s choir to sing on it, but they did not show up for the session. Instead, he recorded the high, clear voice of Suki Lahav, overdubbing it repeatedly, to give a choir-like effect. Lahav, the wife of Springsteen&#x27;s sound engineer at the time, would not be credited for her role, but would later join the E Street Band for six months as a violinist and singer.

No singles were released from &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;. &quot;Sandy&quot; would, however, along with &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot;, become fan favorites from the album, and would garner progressive rock radio airplay during the ramp-up of Springsteen&#x27;s visibility preceding the 1975 release of &quot;Born to Run&quot;. The song would be released as a single in Germany in mid-1975, with the title reversed into &quot;Sandy (4th July, Asbury Park)&quot;. &quot;Sandy&quot; also attracted the attention of other musicians; it was one of the two Springsteen songs that drummer Max Weinberg knew when he auditioned for Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band in late 1974. Once &quot;Born to Run&quot; made Springsteen a major rock figure, &quot;Sandy&quot; received additional airplay on progressive and album oriented rock formats.

== Live performance history ==
&quot;Sandy&quot; was included on Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s best-selling 1986 box set &quot;Live/1975–85&quot;, in a 1980 Nassau Coliseum performance that nevertheless had a &quot;club feel&quot; to it. Its sequencing in the box set represented the opening stages of the journey that the core characters in Springsteen&#x27;s work take; Springsteen said, &quot;Then you get &#x27;Sandy&#x27;. That&#x27;s the guy and he&#x27;s on the boardwalk, and I guess that was me then, when I was still around Asbury. And there&#x27;s the girl... Here it is. This is the beginning of the whole trip that&#x27;s about to take place.&quot; It is also included on the 2003 compilation &quot;The Essential Bruce Springsteen&quot;.

The song was a mainstay of Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s concert set lists during the early part of his career, and a 1975 performance is included on the 2006 &quot;Hammersmith Odeon London &#x27;75&quot; audio and video release. It became much rarer to hear after the 1980–1981 River Tour, appearing only very sporadically, and then usually in New Jersey.

Within the E Street Band, the song was heavily identified with Danny Federici&#x27;s accordion part, which is the main musical element. &quot;Sandy&quot; was played several times late on the first leg of the 2007–2008 Magic Tour, including Federici&#x27;s final regular appearance in November 2007 before taking a leave of absence for melanoma treatment. When Federici made his only return to the stage after that, on March 20, 2008, appearing for portions of a Springsteen and E Street Band performance at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, &quot;Sandy&quot; was the one song that he requested be performed. Following Federici&#x27;s April 17, 2008 death, &quot;Sandy&quot; was performed in tribute to him, with Roy Bittan taking over the accordion part. In July 2008, the live EP &quot;Magic Tour Highlights&quot; was released, with the final Federici performance of &quot;Sandy&quot; the closing track. The song has been played live about 230 times.

== Covers ==
The Hollies recorded a single of &quot;Sandy&quot; (under that title) in 1975, and included it on their &quot;Another Night&quot; album. Released on Epic Records in the U.S. in April 1975, it only achieved minor airplay, reaching number 85 on the U.S. pop singles chart. Nonetheless, &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;winning ballad.&quot; It had better success in New Zealand, reaching number 12 on their singles chart. Though released as a single, it did not reach the chart in the UK, though in London it made no.15 on Capital Radio&#x27;s &#x27;Capital Countdown&#x27; Top 40. While not a big hit unto itself, The Hollies&#x27; use of &quot;Sandy&quot; presaged other artists mining the early Springsteen songbook for material, a notion that would soon be exploited to much greater commercial success by Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band and others.

Air Supply recorded &quot;Sandy&quot; for their 1985 album &quot;Air Supply&quot;. Singer-songwriter Richard Shindell recorded what has been described as a &quot;near-holy reading&quot; of this song for his 2002 live album, &quot;Courier&quot;.

Jason Heath and the Greedy Souls recorded a version in Los Angeles, 2009 which is officially endorsed by Bruce Springsteen. The band line up features the original E Street Band keyboardist and accordion player Danny Federici&#x27;s son, Jason Federici. The song was released through Springsteen&#x27;s website and a video can be seen on YouTube.

Swedish artist Ulf Lundell made a Swedish version of the song called &quot;Sanna, (Nyårsafton Åre 1983) (Sandy)&quot;. The song was dedicated to his daughter Sanna, and instead of taking place on 4th of July, it takes place on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Ben E. King covered the song on the 1997 tribute album &quot;One Step Up/Two Steps Back: The Songs of Bruce Springsteen.&quot;

New York hard rock band Kiss released a single titled &quot;Shandi&quot;, from their 1980 album &quot;Unmasked&quot;, with the song title being inspired by Springsteen&#x27;s Sandy according to Paul Stanley, the only member of Kiss to work on the recording of the song in the studio, although all four members of the group appeared in the song&#x27;s promotional video clip.

Dutch group Theu Boermans en de groep covered this song in a Dutch language as Venlo&#x27;67

== Legacy ==
This song was chosen by Tony Blair as one of his Desert Island Discs, apparently because he listened to it many times when he was courting his future wife Cherie Booth.

== Madam Marie ==

One of the song&#x27;s most famous lines is:

:&quot;Did you hear, the cops finally busted Madam Marie,&quot;
:&quot;for tellin&#x27; fortunes better than they do ...&quot;

The &quot;Madam Marie&quot; mentioned in the song was a real-life fortune teller on the Asbury Park boardwalk named Marie Castello, who died June 27, 2008, aged 93.
Springsteen offered memories and condolences of her on his website, saying:

Springsteen said some of the same remarks on stage during the next show on the Magic Tour, dedicating a performance of &quot;Sandy&quot; in Gothenburg, Sweden on July 4, 2008, to her. Similar dedication took place in Helsinki, Finland a few days later.

The dedication, word-by-word, from Gothenburg:
:&quot;We always send this one out to Danny,&quot;
:&quot;and just a few days ago, Madam Marie,&quot;
:&quot;who was the gypsy teller in the Asbury Park&quot;
:&quot;boardwalk passed away, she was 98,&quot;
:&quot;that&#x27;s a lot of fortune-telling.&quot;

:&quot;There&#x27;s enough mystery lost in the world,&quot;
:&quot;we need all the fortune-tellers we can get,&quot;
:&quot;so tonight we&#x27;re gonna send this one out to&quot;
:&quot;Madam Marie...&quot;

Springsteen incorrectly noted she died at 98; she was in fact 93. The song has always been dedicated to Danny Federici since his death on April 17, 2008, as this was &quot;his&quot; song, featuring a prominent accordion throughout the song.

<text>S&#x27;Archittu (Translation: &quot;the little arch,&quot; in the Sardinian language) is a small coastal tourist resort near Oristano (Sardinia, Italy), part of the municipality of Cuglieri.

== Toponym ==
The locality takes its name from the rock arch (S&#x27;Archittu) which encloses the beach, easily reachable by walk via a footway; during summer nights the arch is illuminated.
The top of the arch is used for sea diving and it was the location of one event in the 2001 High Dive World Championship.
The arch, about 17 metres high, is a result of marine erosion of an ancient cave formed in the limestone.

== Nearby ==
Approximately 1 km to the south of S&#x27;Archittu is Torre del Pozzo (&quot;The Well&#x27;s Tower).

<doc id="100504" wikidata="Q1268822" url="?curid=100504" title="Dymaxion">
<text>Dymaxion is a term coined by architect and inventor Buckminster Fuller and associated with much of his work, prominently his Dymaxion house and Dymaxion car. A portmanteau of the words &quot;dynamic&quot;, &quot;maximum&quot;, and &quot;tension&quot;, Dymaxion sums up the goal of his study, &quot;maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input&quot;.

== Description ==

A name was needed for the display of Fuller&#x27;s first architectural model, later to be known as the Dymaxion house, at the Marshall Field&#x27;s department store in Chicago. To create the name, wordsmith Waldo Warren was hired by Marshall Field&#x27;s and spent two days listening to Fuller, getting a feel for his idiosyncratic use of language—later playing with the syllables typical of Fuller&#x27;s speech until he and Fuller agreed on the word &quot;Dymaxion&quot;.

Fuller used the word for many of his inventions during the decades to follow, including the Dymaxion house, the Dymaxion deployment unit, the Dymaxion car, and the Dymaxion world map. Dymaxion also came to describe a polyphasic sleep schedule he followed, consisting of four 30-minute naps throughout the day. 

Fuller eventually renamed his elaborate journal—a highly specific, highly detailed self-documentation of his life—as the &quot;Dymaxion Chronofile&quot;.
