<text>Kubera (, ) also known as Kuvera, Kuber and Kuberan, is the god of wealth, and the god-king of the semi-divine yakshas in Hinduism. He is regarded as the regent of the north (&quot;Dikpala&quot;), and a protector of the world (&quot;Lokapala&quot;). His many epithets extol him as the overlord of numerous semi-divine species, and the owner of the treasures of the world. Kubera is often depicted with a plump body, adorned with jewels, and carrying a money-pot and a club.

Originally described as the chief of evil spirits in Vedic-era texts, Kubera acquired the status of a &quot;deva&quot; (god) only in the &quot;Purana&quot;s and the Hindu epics. The scriptures describe that Kubera once ruled Lanka, but was overthrown by his half-brother Ravana, later settling in the city of Alaka in the Himalayas. Descriptions of the &quot;glory&quot; and &quot;splendour&quot; of Kubera&#x27;s city are found in many scriptures.

Kubera has also been assimilated into the Buddhist and Jain pantheons. In Buddhism, he is known as Vaisravana, the patronymic used of the Hindu Kubera and is also equated with Pañcika, while in Jainism, he is known as Sarvanubhuti. In Indonesia, Kubera is also known as Daneswara.

==Iconography==
Kubera is often depicted as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes described riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later &quot;Puranic&quot; texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate, or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a sheaf of jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera&#x27;s victory over nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.
In the &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot;, Kubera is described as the embodiment of both &quot;Artha&quot; (&quot;wealth, prosperity, glory&quot;) and &quot;Arthashastra&quot;s, the treatises related to it—and his iconography mirrors it. Kubera&#x27;s complexion is described as that of lotus leaves. He rides a man—the state personified, adorned in golden clothes and ornaments, symbolizing his wealth. His left eye is yellow. He wears an armour and a necklace down to his large belly. The &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; further describes his face to be inclined to the left, sporting a beard and mustache, and with two small tusks protruding from the ends of his mouth, representing his powers to punish and to bestow favours. His wife Riddhi, representing the journey of life, is seated on his left lap, with her left hand on the back of Kubera and the right holding a &quot;ratna-patra&quot; (jewel-pot). Kubera should be four-armed, holding a &quot;gada&quot; (mace: symbol of &quot;dandaniti&quot;—administration of justice) and a &quot;shakti&quot; (power) in his left pair, and standards bearing a lion—representing &quot;Artha&quot; and a &quot;shibika&quot; (a club, the weapon of Kubera). The &quot;nidhi&quot; treasures Padma and Shankha stand beside him in human form, with their heads emerging from a lotus and a conch respectively.

The &quot;Agni Purana&quot; states that Kubera should be installed in temples as seated on a goat, and with a club in his hand. Kubera&#x27;s image is prescribed to be that of gold, with multi-coloured attributes. In some sources, especially in Jain depictions, Kubera is depicted as a drunkard, signified by the &quot;nectar vessel&quot; in his hand.

==Etymology and other names==
The exact origins of the name Kubera are unknown. &quot;Kubera&quot; or &quot;Kuvera&quot; (कुवेर) as spelt in later Sanskrit, means &quot;deformed or monstrous&quot; or &quot;ill-shaped one&quot;; indicating his deformities. Another theory suggests that Kubera may be derived from the verb root &quot;kumba&quot;, meaning to conceal. Kuvera is also split as &quot;ku&quot; (earth), and &quot;vira&quot; (hero).

As the son of Vishrava (&quot;Fame&quot;), Kubera is called &quot;Vaisravana&quot; (in the Pali language, Vessavana) and as the son of Ilavila, &quot;Ailavila&quot;. Vaisravana is sometimes translated as the &quot;Son of Fame&quot;. The &quot;Sutta Nitapa&quot; commentary says that &quot;Vaisravana&quot; is derived from a name of Kubera&#x27;s kingdom, &quot;Visana&quot;. Once, Kubera looked at Shiva and his wife Parvati with jealousy, so he lost one of his eyes. Parvati also turned this deformed eye yellow. So, Kubera gained the name &quot;Ekaksipingala&quot; (&quot;one who has one yellow eye&quot;). He is also called &quot;Bhutesha&quot; (&quot;Lord of spirits&quot;) like Shiva. Kubera usually is drawn by spirits or men (&quot;nara&quot;), so is called &quot;Nara-vahana&quot;, one whose &quot;vahana&quot; (mount) is &quot;nara&quot;. Hopkins interprets &quot;nara&quot;s as being water-spirits, although Mani translates &quot;nara&quot; as men. Kubera also rides the elephant called &quot;Sarvabhauma&quot; as a &quot;loka-pala&quot;. His garden is named Chaitrarath.

Kubera also enjoys the titles &quot;king of the whole world&quot;, &quot;king of kings&quot; (&quot;Rajaraja&quot;), &quot;Lord of wealth&quot; (&quot;Dhanadhipati&quot;) and &quot;giver of wealth&quot; (&quot;Dhanada&quot;). His titles are sometimes related to his subjects: &quot;king of yakshas&quot; (&quot;Yaksharajan&quot;), &quot;Lord of rakshasas&quot; (&quot;Rakshasadhipati&quot;), &quot;Lord of Guhyakas&quot; (&quot;Guhyakadhipa&quot;), &quot;king of Kinnaras&quot;(&quot;Kinnararaja&quot;), &quot;king of animals resembling men&quot; (&quot;Mayuraja&quot;), and &quot;king of men&quot; (&quot;Nararaja&quot;). Kubera is also called &quot;Guhyadhipa&quot; (&quot;Lord of the hidden&quot;). The &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; calls him the &quot;god of hiding&quot;.

==Literature==
===Early descriptions and parentage===
In the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;—where he first appears—and the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;, Kubera is the chief of evil spirits or spirits of darkness, and son of Vaishravana. The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; calls him the Lord of thieves and criminals. In the &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, he becomes a respectable &quot;lokapala&quot; (&quot;world protector&quot;) and the patron of merchants. In the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Kubera is described as the son of &quot;Prajapati&quot; Pulastya and his wife Idavida, and the brother of sage Vishrava. Kubera is described as born from a cow. However, from the &quot;Purana&quot;s, he is described as the grandson of Pulastya and the son of Vishrava and his wife Ilavida (or Ilivila or Devavarnini), daughter of the sage Bharadvaja or Trinabindu.

By this time, though still described as an &quot;asura&quot;, Kubera is offered prayers at the end of all ritual sacrifices. His titles, such as &quot;best of kings&quot; and &quot;Lord of kings&quot; (The&quot;Harivamsa&quot; indicates that Kubera is made &quot;Lord of kings&quot;), in contrast to the god-king of heaven, Indra, whose title of &quot;best of gods&quot; led to the later belief that Kubera was a man. The early texts &quot;Gautama Dharmashastra&quot; and &quot;Apastamba&quot; describe him as a man. Only the &quot;Grihyasutra&quot;s of Shankhayana and Hiranyakesin call him a god, and suggest offerings of meat, sesame seeds and flowers to him.

===Puranic and epic descriptions===

The &quot;Purana&quot;s and the epics &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot; grant Kubera unquestioned godhood. Kubera also acquired the status of the &quot;Lord of riches&quot; and the wealthiest Deva. He also becomes a &quot;lokapala&quot; (&quot;world protector&quot;) and guardian (&quot;dikapala&quot;) of the North direction, although he is also sometimes associated with the East. Kubera&#x27;s status as a &quot;lokapala&quot; and a &quot;dikpala&quot; is assured in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, but in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, some lists do not include Kubera. Thus, Kubera is considered a later addition to the original list of &quot;Loka-pala&quot;s, where the gods Agni or Soma appear in his place. This status, the &quot;Ramayana&quot; records, was granted to Kubera by Brahma—the creator-god and father of Pulastya—as a reward for his severe penance. Brahma also conferred upon Kubera the riches of the world (&quot;Nidhis&quot;), &quot;equality with gods&quot;, and the Pushpaka Vimana, a flying chariot. Kubera then ruled in the golden city of Lanka, identified with modern-day Sri Lanka. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; says that Brahma conferred upon Kubera the lordship of wealth, friendship with Shiva, godhood, status as a world-protector, a son called &quot;Nalakubera&quot;/&quot;Nalakubara&quot;, the Pushpaka Vimana and the lordship of the &quot;Nairrata&quot; demons.

Both the &quot;Purana&quot;s and the &quot;Ramayana&quot; feature the half-blood siblings of Kubera. Vishrava, Kubera&#x27;s father, also married the &quot;rakshasa&quot; (demigod) princess Kaikesi, who mothered four &quot;rakshasa&quot; children: Ravana, the chief antagonist of the Ramayana, and his siblings, Kumbhakarna, Vibhishana, and Shurpanaka. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; regards Vishrava as the brother of Kubera, so Kubera is described as the uncle of Ravana and his siblings. It records that when Kubera approached Brahma for the favour of superseding his father Pulastya, Pulastya created Vishrava. To seek the favour of Vishrava, Kubera sent three women to him, by whom Vishrava begot his demon children. Ravana, after acquiring a boon of Brahma, drove Kubera away from Lanka and seized his Pushpaka Vimana, which was returned to Kubera after Ravana&#x27;s death. Kubera then settled on Gandhamandana mountain, near Mount Kailash – the abode of the god Shiva—in the Himalayas. Sometimes, Kailash itself is called Kubera&#x27;s residence. His city is usually called Alaka or Alaka-puri (&quot;curl-city&quot;), but also &quot;Prabha&quot; (&quot;splendour&quot;), &quot;Vasudhara&quot; (&quot;bejeweled&quot;) and &quot;Vasu-sthali&quot; (&quot;abode of treasures&quot;). There, Kubera had a grove called &quot;Caitraratha&quot;, where the leaves were jewels and the fruits were girls of heaven. There is also a charming lake called &quot;Nalini&quot; in the grove. Kubera is often described as a friend of Shiva in the epics. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; says that Kubera prayed to Shiva for many years, and Shiva granted him the kingship of yakshas.
A description of Kubera&#x27;s magnificent court appears in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as well as the &quot;Meghaduta&quot;. Here, gandharvas and apsaras entertain Kubera. Shiva and his wife Parvati often frequent Kubera&#x27;s court, which is attended by semi-divine beings like the &quot;vidyadharas&quot;; &quot;kimpurushas&quot;; rakshasas; &quot;pishachas&quot;; as well as Padma and Shankha; personified treasures (&quot;nidhi&quot;); and Manibhadra, Kubera&#x27;s chief attendant and chief of his army. Like every world-protector, Kubera has seven seers of the North in residence. Alaka is recorded to be plundered by Ravana once, and attacked by the Pandava prince, Bhima once. Kubera&#x27;s &quot;Nairrata&quot; army is described to have defeated king Mucukunda, who then defeated them by the advice of his guru Vashishta. Shukra, the preceptor of the asuras, is also recorded to have defeated Kubera and stolen his wealth. Another major tale in the scriptures records how Kubera entertained the sage Ashtavakra in his palace.

Kubera is the treasurer of the gods, and the overlord of the semi-divine yakshas, the &quot;guhyaka&quot;s, &quot;kinnara&quot;s and gandharvas, who act as his assistants and protectors of the jewels of the earth, as well as guardians of his city. Kubera is also the guardian of travelers and the giver of wealth to individuals, who please him. The rakshasas also serve Kubera, however, some cannibalistic rakshasas are described to have sided with Ravana in the battle against Kubera. Kubera also developed as minor marriage-divinity. He is invoked with Shiva at weddings and is described as &quot;Kameshvara&quot; (&quot;Lord of &quot;Kama&quot; – pleasure, desire etc.&quot;). He is associated with fertility of the aquatic type.

The &quot;Purana&quot;s and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; record that Kubera married Bhadra (&quot;auspicious&quot;), or Riddhi (&quot;prosperity&quot;), daughter of the demon Mura. She is also called &quot;Yakshi&quot; – a female yaksha, &quot;Kauberi&quot; (&quot;wife of Kubera&quot;) and &quot;Charvi&quot; (&quot;splendour&quot;). They had three sons: Nalakubara (&quot;Reed-axle&quot;), Manigriva (&quot;Bejewled-neck&quot;) or Varna-kavi (&quot;Colourful poet&quot;), and Mayuraja (&quot;king of animals resembling men&quot;); and a daughter called Minakshi (&quot;fish-eyed&quot;).

==Worship==
As the treasurer of the riches of the world, Kubera is prescribed to be worshipped. Kubera is also credited money to the deity Venkateshwara (a form of Vishnu) for his marriage with Padmavati. In remembrance of this, the reason devotees go to Tirupati to donate money in Venkateshwara&#x27;s &quot;Hundi&quot; (&quot;Donation pot&quot;), is so that he can pay it back to Kubera. He is also associated with Lakshmi for this reason, and is sometimes represented with her as Kubera Lakshmi.

While Kubera still enjoys prayers as the god of wealth, his role is largely taken by the god of wisdom, fortune and obstacle-removal, Ganesha, with whom he is generally associated.

==Beyond Hinduism==

Kubera is recognized outside India and Hinduism as well. Kubera is a popular figure in Buddhist as well as Jain mythology. The Orientalist Nagendra Kumar Singh remarked that, &quot;Every Indian religion has a Kubera after the Hindu prototype&quot;.

=== Buddhism ===
Kubera is the Buddhist Vaiśravaṇa or Jambhala, and the Japanese Bishamon. The Buddhist Vaisravana, like the Hindu Kubera, is the regent of the North, a &quot;lokapala&quot; and the Lord of yakshas. He is one of the Four Heavenly Kings, each associated with a cardinal direction. In Buddhist legends, Kubera is also equated with Pañcika, whose wife Hariti is the symbol of abundance. The iconography of Kubera and Pancika is so similar that in certain cases, A. Getty comments, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between Pancika and Kubera. The Japanese Bishamon, also known as Tamon-Ten, is one of the Jūni-Ten (十二天), a group of 12 Hindu deities adopted in Buddhism as guardian deities (&quot;deva&quot; or &quot;ten&quot;) who are found in or around Buddhist shrines. The Juni-Ten group of twelve deities were created by adding four deities to the older grouping of Happou-Ten, the eight guardians of the directions. Bishamon rules over the north, like his Hindu counterpart Kubera.

=== Jainism ===
In Jainism, Kubera is the attendant yaksha of the 19th Tirthankar Mallinath. He is usually called &quot;Sarvanubhuti&quot; or &quot;Sarvahna&quot;, and may be depicted with four faces, rainbow colours and eight arms. The Digambara sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads; while the Śvetāmbaras portray him with four to six arms, numerous choices of weapons, though his attributes, the money bag and citron fruit are consistent. He may ride a man or an elephant. He is related to the Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.

<text>Ambika () is the queen of Kuru Kingdom in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The second daughter of Kashya, the King of Kashi and Kausalya, she is abducted by Bhishma during her svayamvara, and becomes the wife of Vichitravirya, the King of Hastinapura. Ambika is the mother of Dhritarashtra and the grandmother of Kauravas.

==Legend==

Along with her sisters, Amba and Ambalika, Ambika was taken by force by Bhishma from their svayamvara, the latter having challenged and defeated the assembled royalty. He presented them to his step-mother, Satyavati, for marriage to Vichitravirya. While Amba expressed her desire not to marry him as she was in love with a king named Salva, Ambika and Ambalika married Vichitravirya, and spent seven years in their husband&#x27;s company. Vichitravirya was afflicted with tuberculosis, and subsequently died from the disease.

After Vichitravirya&#x27;s death, he left behind no heirs. His mother Satyavati sent for her first born, the rishi Vyasa. She asked him to sire children with the widowed queens of Vichitravirya according to the prevalent custom of Niyoga. Vyasa had come from years of intense meditation, and as a result, looked tremendously unkempt. When he approached Ambika, she closed her eyes in fear. As a result, the blind Dhritrashtra was born from their union. When he approached Ambalika, she turned pale in fear. Her son Pandu, the result of their union, was born with a pale appearance.

After the death of Pandu, Ambika accompanied her mother-in-law Satyavati, and sister Ambalika to the forest, and spent the rest of her days in spiritual retreat.

== In popular culture ==
*In B. R. Chopra&#x27;s 1988 series &quot;Mahabharat&quot;, Ambika was portrayed by Meena Chakrabarty.
* In the 2013 Star Plus&#x27;s series &quot;Mahabharat&quot; (2013), Ambika was portrayed by Aparna Dixit.

<text>Amitābha (, &quot;Measureless&quot; or &quot;Limitless&quot; Light), also known as Amida in Japanese (, widely pronounced Āmítuó), is one of the main Buddhas of Mahayana Buddhism and the most widely venerated Buddhist figure in East Asian Buddhism. Amitābha is also known by the name Amitāyus (&quot;Measureless Life&quot;). 

Amitābha is the main figure in two influential Indian Buddhist Mahayana Scriptures: the &quot;Sutra of Measureless Life&quot; and the &quot;Amitābha Sūtra&quot;. According to the &quot;Sutra of Measureless Life&quot;, Amitābha established a pure land of perfect peace and happiness, called Sukhāvatī (&quot;Blissful&quot;), where beings who mindfully remember him with faith may be reborn and then quickly attain enlightenment. The pure land is the result of a set of vows Amitābha made long ago. As his name means Limitless Light, Amitābha&#x27;s light is said to radiate throughout the cosmos and shine on all beings. Because of this, Amitābha is often depicted radiating light, a symbol for his wisdom. As per the name Amitāyus, this Buddha is also associated with infinite life, since his lifespan is said to be immeasurable. Amitābha&#x27;s measureless life is seen as being related to his infinite compassion.

Amitābha devotion is particularly prominent in East Asian Buddhism, where the practice of mindfulness of Amitābha Buddha (known as &quot;nianfo&quot; in Chinese, &quot;nembutsu&quot; in Japanese) is seen as a path to liberation open to everyone. Amitābha is also the principal Buddha in Pure Land Buddhism, which is a tradition focused on attaining birth in the pure land by relying on the power of Amitābha (also known as &quot;Other Power&quot;) and faithfully reciting Amitabha&#x27;s name. Amitābha is also a major deity in Tibetan Buddhism. where he is associated with pure land practices, as well as phowa (the transference of consciousness at the time of death).

The names Amitāyus and Amitābha (in various Chinese transliterations and translations) are used interchangeably in East Asian Buddhism. In Tibetan Buddhism however, Amitāyus is distinguished from Amitābha, and they are depicted differently in Himalayan art. Amitāyus is also known as a Buddha of long life in Tibetan Buddhism. In East Asian Buddhism, Amitābha is most often depicted as part of a triad with the two bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. In Tibetan Buddhism, the triad includes Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapani (or Padmasambhava) instead.

== Indian Mahayana sources ==

=== The &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtras&quot; ===
The most influential Amitābha focused Mahayana sutras are two sutras known by the Sanskrit title &quot;Sukhāvatī-vyūha&quot; (&quot;Blissful Array,&quot; or the &quot;Array of Sukhāvatī&quot;)&quot;.&quot; These two are the &quot;Short Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; (also known as the &quot;Amitābha Sutra&quot;) and the &quot;Larger Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; (also known as the &quot;Sutra of Infinite Life&quot;). These sutras are the main Indian Mahayana sources for the teachings on Amitābha and his pure land. In these sutras, Amitābha is a transcendent and immortal Buddha who resides in a pure buddhafield that he created. This pure land is located billions of worlds away in the western direction and all beings can attain rebirth there, where they can swiftly become Buddhas themselves.

According to the &quot;Sūtra of Limitless Life&quot;, eons ago, Amitābha was a bodhisattva monk named Dharmākara. In some versions of the sūtra, Dharmākara is described as a former king who, having come into contact with Buddhist teachings through the buddha Lokeśvararāja, renounced his throne and became a monk. For five eons (kalpas), Dharmākara contemplated all the qualities of all the pure buddhafields (realms created a Buddha existing outside of ordinary reality) throughout the cosmos. He then resolved to become a Buddha and to create the best of all pure buddha-fields possessed of many supreme qualities. 

The sutra then recounts how Dharmākara made a series of bodhisattva vows (&quot;praṇidhāna&quot;), pledging that unless these vows were fulfilled, he would not attain Buddhahood. Different versions of the text list varying numbers of these vows (the most common sutra contains ), which serves as the foundation for Pure Land doctrine. These solemn resolutions set out the type of pure land Dharmākara aspired to create, the conditions under which beings might be born into that world, and what kind of beings they would be. After many eons of bodhisattva practice, Dharmākara became Amitābha Buddha (his enlightenment having occurred ten kalpas ago). Since he now presides over the Pure Land of Sukhāvatī (&quot;Utmost Bliss&quot;) in the western direction, it is understood that his vows were indeed fulfilled. 

Among these &quot;past vows&quot;, Dharmākara ensured that all beings born in his land would never fall into lower realms, and would possess golden divine bodies with many superpowers. He also vowed that they would be firmly established on the path to Buddhahood and could enjoy profound peace, happiness and an unlimited lifespan there. Amitābha’s name would be glorified by countless Buddhas, and those who sincerely place their trust in him and wish to be reborn in his Pure Land can attain birth there. 

The central aspect of these vows is the ones which discuss how to attain birth in the pure land. In Pure Land Buddhism, one of the most influential passages has been the eighteenth vow, which states:If, when I attain Buddhahood, sentient beings in the lands of the ten directions who sincerely and joyfully entrust themselves to me, desire to be born in my land, and think of me even ten times should not be born there, may I not attain perfect enlightenment. Excluded however, are those who commit the five grave offenses and abuse the Right Dharma.This vow is also called the &quot;original&quot; or &quot;fundamental&quot; vow in East Asian Pure Land Buddhism, indicating its special status in this tradition. This vow, along with some other passages, made it possible to argue that all kinds of people would attain birth in the pure land, even very wicked, deluded and defiled persons. Barring that one did not commit the five grave acts (patricide, matricide, the murder of an arhat, harming a Buddha, causing schism in the sangha), this scripture seems to open up the possibility of birth in the pure land to everyone who faithfully thinks of the Amitābha even just ten times. A modified version of this universalist teaching (which even removes the exclusion of beings who comitt the five grave acts) would become a central doctrine of Pure Land Buddhism and remains part of its lasting appeal. 

The sutra also explains how, at the moment of death, Amitābha, will appear to those who have aspired to be born in Sukhāvatī. Bodhisattvas who arrive in Sukhāvatī enter the state of non-retrogression (from which there is no falling back into lower states of rebirth), and the state of &quot;one more birth,&quot; meaning they require only one additional lifetime before attaining Buddhahood. Once in Sukhāvatī, all beings can also easily visit other pure lands to make offerings to innumerable Buddhas. In Sukhāvatī, beings are born asexually, appearing fully formed upon lotus flowers in Amitābha’s presence. Some lotuses remain closed, signifying individuals who still harbor doubts about Amitābha. Such beings remain enclosed for 500 years, experiencing their lotus as a palace, yet deprived of the Buddha’s presence. Eventually, as they dispel their doubts, they emerge from this period of purification and witness the splendor of Amitābha.

Both versions of the &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; provide various descriptions which may have served as a guide for meditating on Amitābha within his Pure Land. According to the sutras, those aspiring to be reborn there should cultivate bodhicitta, listen to Amitābha’s name, contemplate him, pray for rebirth in his land, and accumulate merit as a basis for their future birth. Given these conditions, rebirth in Sukhāvatī and eventual enlightenment are significantly more accessible than striving for Buddhahood under the harsh conditions of this world, which is Amitābha Buddha&#x27;s ultimate intent for creating the pure land. This teaching about an easily accessible afterlife made Amitābha a popular Buddha in Gandhara, from where it spread Central Asia and East Asia. 

Regarding the &quot;Smaller Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;, this text primarily describes the various features of Sukhāvatī and further clarifies the methods of attaining rebirth there. It describes, for example, how the birds and trees of Sukhāvatī, themselves manifestations of Amitābha, continuously sing song of the Dharma. According to this sūtra, rebirth in Sukhāvatī is achieved by sincerely holding Amitābha’s name in mind with undistracted focus for one to seven days—an application of the ancient meditation known as &quot;buddhānusmṛti&quot; (recollection of the Buddha). 

===References in other sutras===

Amitābha is also mentioned in numerous other Buddhist sources. Kenneth Tanaka notes that &quot;Thirty one Sanskrit texts and over one hundred Chinese and Tibetan translations refer to Amitābha* and/or Sukhavati.*&quot; 

The earliest Buddhist sutra mentioning Amitābha is the translation into Chinese of the &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra&quot; (般舟三昧經; &quot;Bozhōu Sānmèi Jīng&quot;) by the Kushan monk . This text has been dated to between the 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE by modern buddhologists and may have been translated from the Gandhari language (a fragment of which was discovered in 2018). Other important Mahayana texts which mention Amitabha and his pure land of Sukhavati include the &quot;Ajitasena Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Mahāmegha Sutra,&quot; and the &quot;Samādhirāja Sūtra.&quot; There are also several Indian &quot;Dhāraṇī sutras&quot; (sutras focused on specific magical chants) which are focused on Amitābha including various editions of the &quot;Amitabha Pure Land Rebirth Dhāraṇī,&quot; as well as the &quot;Sūtra of the Dhāraṇī of the King of the Sound of Amitābha’s Drum,&quot; the &quot;Anantamukhanirhāra-dhāraṇī&quot; and the &quot;Fundamental Dhāraṇī of Immeasurable Life Tathagata&quot; (T.930)&quot;.&quot;

Jeff Wilson writes that over a fifth of the sutras in the Taishō Tripiṭaka reference Amitābha, but three sutras in particular have become seen as canonical in East Asian Buddhism: the two &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtras&quot; discussed above and the &quot;Amitāyus Contemplation Sūtra.&quot; The &quot;Contemplation Sūtra&quot; is believed to have been translated into Chinese by Kalayāśas in the early fifth century and belongs to a group of texts focused on the visualization of Buddhas. Unlike other Pure Land sūtras, the &quot;Contemplation Sūtra&quot; emphasizes meditative practices to have a vision of Amitābha, including thirteen stages of visualization. These include meditating on the setting sun, pure water turning into beryl, and eventually visualizing the entire Pure Land with its jeweled pavilions, lotus throne, Amitāyus (Amitābha), and his attendant Bodhisattvas, Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. 

The sūtra also explains that even those guilty of the five gravest transgressions may, just before death, encounter a virtuous teacher who instructs them in the Buddha’s Dharma. If such a person sincerely calls upon Amitāyus’ name ten times, their accumulated negative karma will be purified, and they will be reborn within a lotus bud in Sukhāvatī. After twelve eons, the lotus will bloom, and the individual will behold Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta, who will preach the Dharma and inspire them to cultivate bodhicitta. This sūtra became a cornerstone of the Pure Land tradition, as it offers hope to all people. Its emphasis on salvation through Amitābha’s boundless compassion extends even to the most evil individuals. 

=== In Mahayana treatises ===
Some Mahāyāna treatises mention Amitābha. The &quot;Dasabhumikavibhāsā&quot; (十住毘婆沙論, T.1521), which is traditionally ascribed to Nāgārjuna and survives only in a Chinese translation by Kumārajīva (344-413), teaches the &quot;easy&quot; practice of maintaining constant mindfulness of Amitābha Buddha as a way to attain birth in the pure land. The authorship of this text has been disputed by some scholars, including Akira Hirakawa. 

Vasubandhu (fl. 4th to 5th century CE) is traditionally credited with composing the &quot;Discourse on the Pure Land&quot; (T.1524), a commentary on the &quot;Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra,&quot; which only survives in Chinese translation by the Indian translator Bodhiruci (6th century). This work outlines a five-part practice that may have functioned as a visualization meditation. Amitābha and his pure are also briefly discussed by Vasubandhu&#x27;s brother Asanga in his &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha.&quot;

The author of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; concludes the text with the following dedication to Amitāyus: &quot;By the merit I have acquired through [writing] this [treatise], may all living beings come to perceive the Lord Amitāyus* endowed with infinite light.&quot;

=== History and archeology ===

According to Kenneth Tanaka, Amitābha Buddha emerged as a central figure in the Gandharan Buddhism of the first century CE. Numerous Amitābha Buddha images have been discovered in the Greater Gandhāra region (in modern Pakistan and Afghanistan) from about the first century CE onwards during the Kushan era (30–375 CE). This, along with evidence which suggests that the two main Pure Land sutras were written in the Gandhari language, indicates that Amitābha rose to prominence in Gandharan Buddhism (and in the greater Kushana Empire) during the first century CE.

Regarding the main historical source of the figure of Amitābha, some Western scholars have proposed possible influences on Buddhism from Zoroastrian deities (Ahura Mazda or Zurvan) or from Brahmanical deities or concepts (such as the sun god Surya or the immortality nectar Amritā). Japanese scholars like Kōtatsu Fujita meanwhile tend to place the origin of Amitābha Buddha squarely within Buddhist tradition. 

Other scholars, especially Japanese authors, cite various passages from earlier Buddhist sources which mention Shakyamuni Buddha radiating light rays and which state that his lifespan is immeasurable. Such ideas seem to have been most common in the early Buddhist Mahāsāṃghika tradition, who promoted the docetic idea that the Buddha was ultimately a transcendent (lokottara) being who nevertheless manifested a magical body on earth. One of their sutras is cited by Vasumitra (in a passage that was translated three times by different Chinese figures) as stating that &quot;the form body (&quot;rupakaya&quot;), supernatural power (&quot;prabhāva&quot;) and lifespan (&quot;ayus&quot;) of a Buddha is unlimited (&quot;ananta&quot;).&quot; Julian Pas also notes that, in the version translated by Kumārajīva, Vasumitra&#x27;s passage speaks of the limitless light of the Buddha (&quot;kuan-ming-wu-liang&quot;), which could be a translation of &quot;abha amita.&quot; 

Another Mahāsāṃghika (Lokottaravāda) source, the &quot;Mahāvastu,&quot; states: &quot;the purity of the Buddha is so great that the worship of the Exalted One is sufficient for the attainment of Nirvāna&quot; and &quot;from the Buddha’s smile, there radiate beams which illuminate all buddhafields.&quot; Pas sees the Mahāsāṃghika as promoting a kind of Buddhist bhakti (devotional) movement. These connections with early Mahāsāṃghika doctrines indicate the possibility that Amitābha may have initially signified the limitless lifespan and radiance of the Buddha, pointing to the transcendent dimensions of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. Since the Mahāsāṃghika school was also active in the northwest of India and as far north as Bamiyan (Afghanistan), Pas argues that they are a likely source for the ideas that influenced the rise of the devotional cultus of Amitābha in northwest India, Gandhara, and Bactria. 
The first known epigraphic evidence for Amitābha is the bottom part of a statue found in Govindnagar, Pakistan and now located at Government Museum, Mathura. The statue is dated to &quot;the 26th year of the reign of &quot; i.e., 104 CE. It is a work of Kushan art, made during the Kushan Empire (30–375 CE), and was dedicated to &quot;Amitābha Buddha&quot; by a family of merchants. 

Gregory Schopen translates the inscription as follows: The 26th year of the Great King Huveṣka, the 2nd month, the 26th day. On this day by Nāgarakṣita, the (father) of the trader (Sax-caka), the grandson of the merchant Balakatta, the (son of Buddhapila), an image of the Blessed One, the Buddha Amitābha was set up for the worship of all buddhas. Through this root of merit (may) all living things (obtain) the unexcelled knowledge of a buddha. Another early epigraphic mention of Amitabha (c. 610 CE) is found in Patan (Lalitpur). It is a verse which states: &quot;I praise Amitabha, the best, dispeller of illusion by the light of great prajña. The light, victor who lives in Sukhavati with Lokesvara, the destroyer of the fear arising in the world, bearer of the lotus, and Mahasthamaprapta, the affectionate-hearted one.&quot; One of the last Indian sculptures of Amitābha can be found in the trademark black stone of the Pala Empire (c. 750–1161 CE), which was the last Buddhist empire of India.

The appearance of sculptural remains dating to the end of the second century suggests that Amitābha was becoming popular in the first and second centuries CE in Gandhara and Central Asia. Apart from the Gandhara region, not much evidence has been found for extensive Amitabha worship in the rest of the Indian subcontinent before the 8th century. During the 8th century, the Chinese monk Cimin Huiri visited India and learned about Pure Land Amitabha devotion there. 

From its initial home in Greater Gandhāra, Amitābha worship and its images quickly spread via the Silk road to Central Asian kingdoms like Khotan, and then to China as well as Southeast Asian regions like Indonesia. The earliest dated Amitābha image in China is from the Longmen Grottoes and is dated to 519 CE. During the Sui Dynasty (581–618) and the succeding Tang dynasty, China saw a growth in the creation of Amitabha images and paintings. Some exemplary Amitabha art from this period can be found in Dunhuang.

==In East Asian Buddhism==
=== Mainland East Asia ===
Amitābha is one of the most important Buddhas in East Asian Buddhism. Some of the earliest evidence for Amitābha devotion is found in the works of Zhi Dun (314–366), a Neo-Daoist convert to Buddhism. The Chinese translations of Kumārajīva (344–413 CE), Buddhabhadra (359–429 CE), and others introduced the main Pure Land Sutras to East Asian Buddhists. 

In China, &quot;Buddha recollection&quot; (Skt: buddhānusmṛti, Ch: nianfo) based on Amitābha became the central practice of Pure Land Buddhism, a tradition which developed gradually through the writings and teachings of several key Chinese monks that lived from the Northern Wei (386–534) period to the Tang dynasty (618 to 907). Key figures in this tradition include Tanluan (476–554), Daochuo (562–645), Shandao (613–681), Huaigan (c. 7th century) and Fazhao (746–838). These Pure Land masters promoted and defended the view that any type of person could reach Amitābha&#x27;s Pure Land (and immediately attain the state of non-retrogression) through relatively easy and accessible practices like reciting or chanting Amitābha&#x27;s name. They argued that this practice was effective due to Amitābha&#x27;s compassionate Other Power, which was the dominant cause for one&#x27;s birth in the pure land (where one could attain Buddhahood much more swiftly and easily). This made Amitābha centered Pure Land Buddhism a very popular practice among laypeople and commoners who did not have the time for extensive meditation or other Buddhist practices. 

Regarding the nature of Amitābha Buddha himself, Pure Land masters like Daochuo and Shandao argued that Amitābha was a &quot;saṃbhogakāya&quot; (self-enjoyment body) Buddha. This view ran counter to the previously popular idea which saw Amitābha as a &quot;nirmāṇakāya&quot; (transformation body) Buddha, like Shakyamuni Buddha. 

A &quot;saṃbhogakāya&quot; is a divine body associated with more transcendent Buddhas which are beyong the triple world and have unlimited lifespans. A &quot;nirmāṇakāya&quot; meanwhile is a form body which is more contingent and human-like (though still supramundane), and also has a limited lifespan and manifests a nirvana which appears as death or cessation. As such, saṃbhogakāyas have a higher ontological status in the classic Mahayana schema of the triple body (trikaya). Some Indian Mahayana works state that saṃbhogakāyas are only visible and accessible to bodhisattvas who have entered the bodhisattva stages. In spite of this, Shandao and other Pure Land masters affirmed that Amitābha and his pure land were a saṃbhogakāya &quot;and&quot; also that it was accessible to all kinds of beings. According to Shandao, this is only possible because of the great compassionate Other Power of Amitābha Buddha. 

Amitābha devotion also became an important current within other Chinese Buddhist traditions, like the Tiantai, Sanlun, and Vinaya schools. During the Song dynasty (960–1279), Tiantai monks such as Shengchang, Ciyun Zunshi, and Siming Zhili, founded Pure Land societies which focused on the recitation of Amitābha&#x27;s name. Later eras saw further doctrinal refinements of Chinese Amitābha devotion, with the writings of scholars like Yuan Hongdao (1568–1610) and Ouyi Zhixu (1599–1655). During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), scholars of the Huayan school like Peng Shaosheng (1740–1796) also adopted and wrote on Amitābha devotion, identifying Amitābha Buddha with Vairocana, the cosmic Buddha of the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;. 

The recitation of Amitābha&#x27;s name is a widespread practice among contemporary Chinese Buddhists (and other Buddhists in the East Asian mainland). This practice known as &quot;nianfo&quot; () in Chinese and &quot;nembutsu&quot; in Japanese and entails the recitation or chanting (melodic or monotone) of the phrase 南無阿彌陀佛 (Mandarin: Nāmó Ēmítuófó, Japanese: Namu Amida Butsu) which means &quot;Homage to Amitābha Buddha&quot;. Aside from being a popular chant and meditation, this phrase is also seen as auspicious and is reproduced in many ways including calligraphy scrolls, public inscriptions, charms, amulets, altarpieces and electronic devices.

=== Japanese Buddhism ===
Amitābha also became a central figure for Japanese Buddhism. His worship became established on the island during the Nara period (710–794) and was it one of the main practices taught in the Tendai school during the Heian period (794–1185). 

The popularity of Amitābha centered practices eventually led to the formation of independent Pure Land schools which focused on Amitābha exclusively. The Tendai monk Hōnen (1133–1212) was the most influential figure who led this Pure Land movement during the Kamakura period. Hōnen was converted to the Pure Land path through his reading of Shandao and the other Chinese masters and became a popular author and preacher, bringing many people to the Pure Land teaching. He argued that people should set aside other practices and focus on the simple recitation of Amitābha&#x27;s name to gain birth in the pure land. Compared to the complex teachings of the other traditions of the time, this simpler approach to Buddhism was much more appealing to common laypeople. This led to an increase in Amitābha devotion among commoners. 

Over time, these new Amitābha focused traditions established by Hōnen&#x27;s followers (mainly Jōdo-shū, and Shinran&#x27;s ) became the largest Buddhist tradition in Japan and remain so to this day.

==In Vajrayāna Buddhism==

Amitābha remained an influential Buddha in the Vajrayāna Buddhist pantheon. He is considered one of the Five Tathagatas, together with Akshobhya, Amoghasiddhi, Ratnasambhava, and Vairocana. In this esoteric buddhological schema, Amitābha is seen as part of the Lotus Buddha Family, which is associated with the color red, the Western direction, the aggregate of perception (saṃjñā), the defilement of craving and the bījamantra &quot;Hrih&quot;. In Buddhist esoteric scriptures, Amitābha is also said to have a wisdom consort, the female Buddha Pāṇḍaravāsinī. 

Amitābha is an important figure in Tibet, Mongolia, Nepal, India and other regions where Tibetan Buddhism is practiced. In Tibetan Buddhist depictions, Amitābha appears with bodhisattvas Vajrapani and Avalokiteśvara, the former to his left and the latter to his right. There numerous Tibetan Buddhist teachings and practice lineages which focused on attaining rebirth in the buddhafield of Amitābha. These include exoteric (or sutra) and esoteric (or tantric) practices&quot;.&quot; The composition of Amitābha focused works was popular among major Tibetan Buddhist figures such as Sakya Pandita, Dolpopa, Tsongkhapa and Karma Chagme.

In Tibetan Buddhism, Amitābha is clearly distinguished from Amitāyus (Measureless Life), while both names are used interchangeably in East Asian Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism sees Amitāyus as an enjoyment body (&quot;saṃbhogakāya&quot;) while Amitābha is seen as a manifestation body. 

Birth in Amitābha&#x27;s Sukhavati remains an important goal for many Tibetan Buddhists, especially laypersons who commonly revere Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara and Padmasambhava as three bodies of a single Buddha. Amitābha is invoked during the yogic death practice called phowa (&quot;transference of consciousness at the time of death&quot;). Furthermore, Amitāyus is also commonly invoked in practices relating to longevity and preventing an untimely death. In Tibetan Buddhism, Amitāyus is also one of the three deities of long life (Amitāyus, White Tara and Uṣṇīṣavijayā). &quot;Amitāyus&quot; being a compound of &quot;amita&quot; (&quot;infinite&quot;) and &quot;āyus&quot; (&quot;life&quot;), and so means &quot;he whose life is boundless&quot;.

The Panchen Lamas and the Shamarpas are considered to be emanations of Amitābha.

In Japanese Shingon Buddhism, Amitābha is included as part of the thirteen Buddhas. Amitābha is associated with the Diamond Realm (&quot;vajradhātu&quot;), whereas Amitāyus is associated with the Womb Realm (&quot;garbhakoṣadhātu&quot;). Shingon, like Tibetan Buddhism, also uses special devotional mantras for Amitābha, though the mantras used differ. Amitābha is also one of the Buddhas featured in the Womb Realm Mandala used in Shingon practices, and sits to the west, which is where the Pure Land of Amitābha is said to dwell. 

===Mantras===

In Esoteric Buddhism, Amitābha Buddha has various mantras associated with him. His main seed syllable mantra is hrīḥ. 

In Tibetan Buddhism, the main mantra of Amitābha is &quot;Om ami dewa hri&quot; (Sanskrit: ). This is an alternative form of .

Amitabha&#x27;s main mantra in Shingon Buddhism is &#x27; (Japanese: ), which represents the underlying Sanskrit form: &#x27;.

== Names==
The proper form of Amitābha&#x27;s name in Sanskrit is &#x27;, masculine, and the nominative singular is &#x27;. This is a compound of the Sanskrit words &quot;amita&quot; (&quot;without bound, without limit&quot;) and &quot;ābhā&quot; (&quot;light, splendor&quot;). Consequently, the name literally means boundless light or limitless light. The name &quot;Amitāyus&quot; (nominative form &quot;&quot;) means limitless life, from the Sanskrit &quot;ayus&quot;. 

In Chinese, the most common name is , which is pronounced &quot;Ēmítuófó&quot; or &quot;Amítuófó&quot; in modern Chinese. The Chinese 阿彌陀佛 is either a transliteration of the Sanskrit &quot;Amitābha&quot; or possibly the Prakrit form &quot;Amidā&#x27;a&quot;. It is not, according to Jan Nattier, a transliteration of &quot;Amita&quot; (&quot;Limitless&quot;) alone. &quot;Fo&quot; (佛) is the Chinese word for &quot;Buddha&quot;. This transliteration goes back to the early translations of Lokaksema. Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese traditionally use the same Chinese characters, though they are pronounced differently (Japanese: &quot;Amida Butsu&quot;, Korean: &quot;Amita Bul&quot;, Vietnamese: &quot;A Di Đà Phật&quot;).

In addition to transliteration, the name Amitābha was also been translated into Chinese using characters. One of the earliest such translations was 無量 Wúliàng (&quot;Limitless&quot;). This was also used in longer names like &quot;Infinite Light&quot; (Wúliàngguāng 無量光) and &quot;Infinite Purity&quot; (Wúliàng Qīngjìng 无量清净, possibly from the Prakrit *Amidā&#x27;a-viśuha). In the same fashion, the name Amitāyus (&quot;Infinite Life&quot;) has been translated as 無量壽 (Wúliàngshòu), though this appears at a later date than the Amitābha derived names. These translated names are not, however, very commonly used.

In Japanese, Amitābha is also called . 

In esoteric Buddhist texts, Amitābha is often called Amṛta (甘露, or 甘露王, lit. sweet-dew king). 

In Tibetan, Amitābha is called and Amitāyus is translated as .

Apart from these standard names, numerous other sources contain other names of Amitāyus. Alternative names include: Aparimitāyus (Unlimited Life), Aparimitāyur-jñāna (Unlimited Life and Wisdom), Vajra-āyuṣa (Vajra Life), Dundubhisvara-rāja, Amṛta-dundubhisvara-rāja (King of the Drum of Immortality) and Aparimitāyurjñānasuviniścitatejorāja (The Blazing King Who Is Completely Certain of Immeasurable Longevity and Wisdom).

=== Significance of the Name ===

Pure Land Buddhism places profound significance on &quot;the Name&quot; (Ch: 名号 mínghào, Jp: myōgō) of Amitābha. The Name is central to Pure Land doctrine and practice (being the core of nianfo/nembutsu practice in most of Asia. According to patriarch Daochuo, the Name is the essence of Amitābha Buddha&#x27;s Vow to save all sentient beings. According to the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Vows in the &quot;Infinite Life Sutra&quot;, Amida vowed that his Name would be praised by all Buddhas and that anyone who recites it with faith will be assured of birth in the Pure Land. According to Pure Land figures like Tanluan and Shinran, the Name is not merely a conventional label or word, but embodies the totality of Amida&#x27;s virtue, wisdom, and compassion. Since the Buddha infused the Name with all of his power and virtues, it is the most accessible means for ordinary beings to tap into Buddha&#x27;s other-power and attain liberation. 

The Name is deeply intertwined with Thusness (Dharmakaya) and serves as a bridge between the ultimate reality of Buddhahood and the limited experience of ordinary beings. Tanluan and Shinran emphasized that the Name is not an empty linguistic signifier but the very manifestation of Amida&#x27;s Wisdom and Compassion. It is indeed Amitābha himself in the form of sound. Through the Name, Amida communicates with sentient beings, making his presence tangible and accessible. Shinran further elaborated that the Name is inseparable from the Dharma-nature itself, meaning that reciting &quot;Namu-Amida-Butsu&quot; is not just an act of devotion but a direct engagement with the ultimate truth. 

The Name also plays a crucial role in the awakening of faith (shinjin) in practitioners. Pure Land teachers like Shinran taught that faith is not something generated by the individual but is received through the Name. The Name acts as the medium through which Amida&#x27;s compassion is transferred to the practitioner, transforming their mind and aligning it with the Dharma. This process underscores the Name&#x27;s dual function: it is both the means of salvation and the expression of Amida&#x27;s Vow. To illustrate the power of the name, the Chinese patriarch Tanluan compares the Buddha&#x27;s name to a bright light which can instantly illuminate a pitch black room, even if that room has been dark for eons. Tanluan also writes: If all who hear the meritorious Name of Amitabha but have faith in, and take joy in what they have heard, and if for one instant of thought they have utmost sincerity, and if they transfer these merits and desire rebirth, then they shall attain rebirth [in the pure land].

=== The Lights of Amitābha ===
The &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; contains twelve or more epithets of Amitābha Buddha which are also called &quot;Buddha&#x27;s lights&quot;. Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Birth in the Pure Land&quot; references these &quot;lights of Amitābha&quot;. These &quot;Buddha lights&quot; were seen as manifestations of Amitābha Buddha in Chinese Buddhism. The recitation of these names were also taught by Chinese Pure Land figures like Shandao. 

There are various sets of these names found in different sources, which include &quot;Infinite Life Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Dà bǎo jī jīng&quot;), and the &quot;Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa Sūtra&quot;. 

The &quot;Infinite Life sutra&quot; lists twelve names of Amitābha: 

# 無量光 (Wúliàng guāng) - Boundless light
# 無邊光 (Wúbiān guāng) - Unlimited Light
# 無礙光 (Wú&#x27;ài guāng) - Unobstructed Light or Irresistible Light
# 無對光 (Wúduì guāng) - Incomparable Light
# 燄王光 (Èwáng guāng) - King of Blazing Light (or Flame-king light)
# 清浄光 (Qīngjìng guāng) - Pure Light
# 歡喜光 (Huānxǐ guāng) - Joyful Light
# 智慧光 (Zhìhuì guāng) - Light of Wisdom
# 不断光 (Bùduàn guāng) - Uninterrupted Light or Unending Light
# 難思光 (Nánsī guāng) - Inconceivable Light
# 無構光 (Wúgòu guāng) - Indescribable light
# 超日月光 (Chāo rìyuè guāng) - Light Surpassing the Sun and Moon 
The surviving Sanskrit edition of the &quot;Sutra of Infinite Life&quot; meanwhile has a different list with eighteen names:

# Tathāgato &#x27;mitābha - The Tathāgata Immeasurable Light
# Amitaprabha - Immeasurable Radiance
# Amitaprabhāso - Unbounded Radiance
# Asamāptaprabha - Unending Radiance
# Asaṃgataprabha - Inconceivable Radiance
# Prabhāśikhotsṛṣṭaprabha - [The one with a] splendorous crest which emits radiance
# Sādivyamaṇiprabha - [The one with] Divine Jewel Splendor
# Apratihataraśmirāgaprabha - [The one with] light rays that are unobstructed and radiant
# Rājanīyaprabha - King Radiance
# Premaṇīyaprabha - Lovable Radiance
# Pramodanīyaprabha - Joyful Radiance
# Saṃgamanīyaprabha - Harmonious Radiance
# Upoṣaṇīyaprabha - Worshipful Radiance
# Nibandhanīyaprabha - Unbreakable Radiance
# Ativīryaprabha - Supremely vigorous radiance
# Atulyaprabha - Incomparable Radiance
# Abhibhūyanarendrāmūnnayendraprabha - Surpassing the splendor kings and gods
# Śrāntasaṃcayendusūryajihmīkaraṇaprabha - Surpassing the splendor of the moon and stars

== Iconography ==


When depicted in the standing position (upon a lotus pedestal), Amitābha is often shown with left arm bare and extended downward with thumb and forefinger touching, with the right hand facing outward also with thumb and forefinger touching. This mudrā is called the &quot;welcoming mudrā&quot; (Jp: &quot;raigō&quot;), and it is a gesture welcoming all beings to Amida&#x27;s Pure Land. It signifies that wisdom (symbolized by the raised hand) is accessible to even the lowest beings, while the outstretched hand shows that Amitābha&#x27;s compassion is directed at the lowest beings, who cannot save themselves.

When depicted in the sitting posture, Amitābha is often shown displaying the meditation mudrā (thumbs touching and fingers together as in the Great Buddha of Kamakura at Kōtoku-in or welcoming mudrā. The earth-touching mudrā (right hand pointed downward over the right leg, palm inward) is reserved for a seated Shakyamuni Buddha alone.

Amitābha is said to display 84,000 auspicious and distinguishing marks reflecting his many virtues. Some common marks seen in art include rays of light (vyāmaprabhā), an aureole or large halo (prabhāvalī), his urna (spiral or circle in between his eyebrows), and a circular symbol (sometimes a swastika) on his chest (this is called Śrīvatsa). 

When not depicted alone, Amitābha is often portrayed with two assistant bodhisattvas, usually Avalokiteśvara on the right and Mahāsthāmaprāpta on the left. This iconography is known as an &quot;Amitābha triad.&quot; The Amitābha triad likely originated in Gandhara, and is especially common in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean art. 

According to Katsumi Tanabe, Gandhāran Buddhist art also depicted Amitābha in four other lesser known triads:

* Maitreya/Amida/Avalokitasvara (the most numerous triad)
* Avalokitasvara/Amida/Maitreya
* Mañjuśrī/Amida/Avalokitasvara
* Mahāsthāmaprāpta/Amida/Maitreya

In Tibetan Buddhism, Mahāsthāmaprāpta is commonly replaced with Vajrapani or Padmasambhava. Some East Asian depictions also show Amitābha with a larger group of bodhisattvas, either the eight great bodhisattvas or a host of twenty five bodhisattvas. Descent paintings (known as &quot;raigo&quot; in Japanese) showing Amitabha with a host of bodhisattvas coming to lead the dying to the pure land often show twenty five bodhisattvas playing music.

In the artistic traditions of Vajrayana Buddhism, a distinction is made between Amitāyus (Buddha of Infinite Life) and Amitābha (Buddha of Infinite Light). These two figures are seen as identical in East Asian Buddhism and some sutras use both names interchangeably. However, in Tibetan Buddhism, they are iconographically distinct. Amitāyus is depicted in fine clothes, an ornate crown, and jewels. Amitābha is depicted in simple monk&#x27;s clothing (kasaya).

<text>Ammavaru () (), according to Hindu belief, is an ancient goddess who laid the egg that hatched Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. &quot;Amma&quot; means mother. She is thought to have existed before the beginning of time.

A notable worship site for Ammavaru is Dharmasthala Temple, located in Dharmasthala in Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka, India, where she is revered alongside a form of Shiva and the Jain tirthankara, Chandraprabha.

Annually, the women of South India who believe in Ammavaru conduct a ritual prayer to the deity. A metal pot filled with rice is used to symbolize the goddess&#x27; body. The pot is clothed in a traditional sari. At the mouth of the pot, a painted coconut is used to symbolize the head. Varying implements are used to fashion the eyes, ears, and nose of the Goddess.

<text>Amrita (, IAST: &quot;amṛta&quot;), Amrit or Amata in Pali, (also called &quot;Sudha&quot;, &quot;Amiy&quot;, &quot;Ami&quot;) is a Sanskrit word that means &quot;immortality&quot;. It is a central concept within Indian religions and is often referred to in ancient Indian texts as an elixir. Its first occurrence is in the Rigveda, where it is considered one of several synonyms for &quot;soma&quot;, the drink of the devas. Amrita plays a significant role in the Samudra Manthana, and is the cause of the conflict between devas and asuras competing for amrita to obtain immortality.

Amrita has varying significance in different Indian religions. The word &quot;Amrit&quot; is also a common first name for Sikhs and Hindus, while its feminine form is &quot;Amritā&quot;. Amrita is cognate to and shares many similarities with ambrosia; both originated from a common Proto-Indo-European source.

== Etymology ==
Amrita is composed of the negative prefix, अ from Sanskrit meaning &#x27;not&#x27;, and meaning &#x27;death&#x27; in Sanskrit, thus meaning &#x27;not death&#x27; or &#x27;immortal/deathless&#x27;.

The concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two ancient Indo-European languages: Ancient Greek and Sanskrit. The Greek ἀμβροσία (&quot;ambrosia&quot;, from ἀ- “not” + βροτός “mortal”) is semantically linked to the Sanskrit (&quot;amṛta&quot;) as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality. The two words appear to be derived from the same Indo-European form *&quot;ṇ-mṛ-tós&quot;, &quot;un-dying&quot; (&quot;n-&quot;: negative prefix from which the prefix &quot;a-&quot; in both Greek and Sanskrit are derived; &quot;mṛ&quot;: zero grade of *&quot;mer-&quot;, &quot;to die&quot;; and &quot;-to-&quot;: adjectival suffix). A semantically similar etymology exists for Greek nectar, the beverage of the gods (Greek: νέκταρ &quot;néktar&quot;) presumed to be a compound of the PIE roots &quot;*nek-&quot;, &quot;death&quot;, and &quot;-*tar&quot;, &quot;overcoming&quot;.

== Hinduism ==
Amrita is repeatedly referred to as the drink of the devas, which grants them immortality. Despite this, the nectar does not actually offer true immortality. Instead, by partaking it, the devas were able to attain a higher level of knowledge and power, which they had lost due to the curse of the sage Durvasa, as described in the Samudra Manthana legend. It tells how the devas, after the curse, begin to lose their immortality. Assisted by their rivals, the asuras, the devas begin to churn the ocean, releasing, among other extraordinary objects and beings, a pitcher of amrita, held by the deity Dhanvantari.

Brahma enlightens the devas regarding the existence of this substance:

When the asuras claim the nectar for themselves, Vishnu assumes the form of the enchantress Mohini, and her beauty persuades the asuras to crudely offer her the task of its distribution:
When the danava Rahu disguised himself as a deva and sat in the clan&#x27;s row to partake in consuming the nectar, Surya and Chandra alerted Mohini of his presence. Mohini sliced his head off with her Sudarshana Chakra, and continued to distribute the nectar to every single one of the devas, after which she assumed her true form of Narayana and defeated the asuras in a battle.

== Sikhism ==
In Sikhism, amrit () is the name of the holy water used in Amrit Sanchar, a ceremony which resembles baptism. This ceremony is observed to initiate the Sikhs into the Khalsa and requires drinking amrit. This is created by mixing a number of soluble ingredients, including sugar, and is then rolled with a khanda with the accompaniment of scriptural recitation of five sacred verses.

Metaphorically, God&#x27;s name is also referred to as a nectar:
&lt;poem&gt;ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਸਬਦੁ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਹਰਿ ਬਾਣੀ ॥

The Shabda is Amrit; the Lord&#x27;s &quot;bani&quot; is Amrit.

ਸਤਿਗੁਰਿ ਸੇਵਿਐ ਰਿਦੈ ਸਮਾਣੀ ॥

Serving the True Guru, it permeates the heart.

ਨਾਨਕ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਨਾਮੁ ਸਦਾ ਸੁਖਦਾਤਾ ਪੀ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤੁ ਸਭ ਭੁਖ ਲਹਿ ਜਾਵਣਿਆ ॥

O Nanak, the Ambrosial Naam is forever the Giver of peace; drinking in this Amrit, all hunger is satisfied.&lt;/poem&gt;
== Buddhism ==
Amṛta (Pali: amata; Tibetan: ’chi med/bdud rtsi; Chinese: 甘露, ganlu) symbolizes immortality, liberation, and spiritual purity. The term describes the &quot;nectar&quot; or &quot;ambrosia&quot; of the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, a divine substance consumed by gods (devas) to confer immortality. This association extends to Buddhist teachings, which are often referred to as the &quot;sweet rain of Dharma&quot; (dharmavarṣam amṛtam). 

In doctrinal contexts, amṛta often refers to the ultimate goal of spiritual practice: liberation (vimokṣa). Nirvāṇa is described as &quot;deathless,&quot; likened to an elixir that brings serenity and clarity to the enlightened person. Practitioners are said to metaphorically and physically &quot;touch the deathless element&quot; during profound spiritual experiences. 

Amṛta is also associated with healing substances, including the five divine nectars (pañcāmṛta): milk, ghee, butter, honey, and sugar. In Tibetan Buddhism, these are incorporated into tantric rituals, where they are transformed into offerings in a skull cup (kapāla). Pills made from amṛta (bdud rtsi ril bu) are sometimes distributed by religious figures for spiritual and physical benefits. 

=== Theravada Buddhism ===
According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, &quot;the deathless&quot; refers to the deathless dimension of the mind which is dwelled in permanently after nibbana.

In the Amata Sutta, the Buddha advises monks to stay with the four Satipatthana: &quot;Monks, remain with your minds well-established in these four establishings of mindfulness. Don&#x27;t let the deathless be lost to you.&quot;

In the questions for Nagasena, King Milinda asks for evidence that the Buddha once lived, wherein Nagasena describes evidence of the Dhamma in a simile:

=== Chinese Buddhism ===
Chinese Buddhism describes Amrita () as blessed water, food, or other consumable objects often produced through merits of chanting mantras.

=== Vajrayana Buddhism ===

Amrita () also plays a significant role in Vajrayana Buddhism as a sacramental drink which is consumed at the beginning of all important rituals such as the abhisheka, ganachakra, and homa. In the Tibetan tradition, &quot;dütsi&quot; is made during – lengthy ceremonies involving many high lamas. It usually takes the form of small, dark-brown grains that are taken with water, or dissolved in very weak solutions of alcohol and is said to improve physical and spiritual well-being.

The foundational text of traditional Tibetan medicine, the Four Tantras, is also known by the name &quot;The Heart of Amrita&quot; ().

&quot;The Immaculate Crystal Garland&quot; () describes the origin of amrita in a version of the samudra manthana legend retold in Buddhist terms. In this Vajrayana version, the monster Rahu steals the amrita and is blasted by Vajrapani&#x27;s thunderbolt. As Rahu has already drunk the amrita he cannot die, but his blood, dripping onto the surface of this earth, causes all kinds of medicinal plants to grow. At the behest of all the Buddhas, Vajrapani reassembles Rahu who eventually becomes a protector of Buddhism according to the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism.

&quot;Inner Offering&quot; (, ) is the most symbolic amrita offering assembly, and the &quot;Inner Offering Nectar Pill&quot; (, ) is a precious and secret medicine of Tibetan Buddhism, which are only used internally for higher-ranking monks in Nyingma school. Its ingredients including Five Amrita and Five Meat, which represents five buddhas, and five elements respectively. According to &quot;Tantras of Chakravarti&quot;, and &quot;Tantras of Vajravārāhī&quot;, a ceremony needs to be held for melting and blessing the Inner-Offering Nectar. Five Nectar needs to be arranged in four directions: yellow excrement in the east, green bone marrow in the north, white semen in the west and red blood in the south; blue urine is placed in the center. Four Nectar should come from wise monks and the ova should be collected from the first menstruation of a blessed woman. The Five Meats are arranged similarly, meat of black bull in the southeast, the meat of the blue dog in the southwest, the meat of the white elephant in the northwest, the meat of the green horse in the northeast, and the meat of a red human corpse in the center. After the ceremony, these ingredients will transform into a &quot;one taste&quot; (&quot;ekarasa&quot;) elixir, which bestows bliss, vitality, immortality and wisdom. Actual modern practitioners will take a &#x27;synthesized essence&#x27; of the Nectar Pill and combine it with energy drinks and alcohol, but mostly the &quot;Nectar Pill&quot; are derived from plants.

<text>The Vasus () are a group of deities in Hinduism associated with fire and light. They are described as the attendant deities of Indra, and later Vishnu. Generally numbering eight and classified as the Ashtavasu, they are described in the Ramayana as the children of Kashyapa and Aditi, and in the Mahabharata as the sons of Manu or Dharma and a daughter of Daksha named Vasu. They are eight among the thirty-three gods featured in the Vedas.

== Etymology ==
The Sanskrit term &quot;Vasu&quot;(s) is translated as the &quot;bright ones&quot;.

==List==
There are varying lists of the eight Vasus in different texts, sometimes only because particular deities have varying names. The following are names and meanings according to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Manava Purana, and according to the Mahabharata, as normally equated:

Though the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; uses the &quot;Brhad-Aranyaka&quot; names, most later texts follow the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; names with the exception that Āpa &#x27;water&#x27; usually appears in place of Aha. The Vishnu Purana equates Prabhāsa with the lights of the 27 Nakshatras (Constellations/Lunar Mansions) and Dhruva with Akasha, that is &quot;space&quot;, Dhruva seemingly taking over Aha&#x27;s role when Aha is replaced by Āpa.

==Legend==

In the &quot;Ramayana&quot; the Vasus are children of Aditi and Kashyapa.

The Mahabharata relates how the Vasus, led by &quot;Prithu&quot; (presumably here a male form of Prithvi), were enjoying themselves in the forest, when the wife of Prabhasa (also referred to as Dyaus) spotted a divine cow and persuaded her husband Prabhasa to steal it, which Prabhasa did with the agreement and aid of Prithu and his other brothers. Unfortunately for the Vasus, the cow was owned by the sage Vashishta who learned through his ascetic powers that the Vasus had stolen it. He immediately cursed them to be born on earth as mortals. Vashishta responded to pleading by the Vasus by promising that seven of them would be free of earthly life within a year of being born and that only Prabhasa would pay the full penalty. The Vasus then requested the river-goddess Ganga to be their mother. Ganga incarnated and became the wife of King Shantanu on condition that he never gainsaid her in any way. As seven children were born, one after the other, Ganga drowned them in her own waters, freeing them from their punishment and the king made no opposition. Only when the eighth was born did the king finally oppose his wife, who therefore left him. So the eighth son, Prabhasa incarnated, remained alive, imprisoned in mortal form, and later became known in his mortal incarnation as Bhishma.

==Other uses==
&quot;Vasu&quot; is also the name of the eighth &quot;chakra&quot; (group) of &quot;Melakarta&quot; ragas in Carnatic music. The names of &quot;chakras&quot; are based on the numbers associated with each name. In this case, there are 8 &quot;Vasus&quot; and hence the eighth &quot;chakra&quot; is &quot;Vasu&quot;.

<doc id="100337" wikidata="Q597330" url="?curid=100337" title="Standard ML">
<text>Standard ML (SML) is a general-purpose, high-level, modular, functional programming language with compile-time type checking and type inference. It is popular for writing compilers, for programming language research, and for developing theorem provers.

Standard ML is a modern dialect of ML, the language used in the Logic for Computable Functions (LCF) theorem-proving project. It is distinctive among widely used languages in that it has a formal specification, given as typing rules and operational semantics in &quot;The Definition of Standard ML&quot;.

==Language==
Standard ML is a functional programming language with some impure features. Programs written in Standard ML consist of expressions in contrast to statements or commands, although some expressions of type unit are only evaluated for their side-effects.

===Functions===
Like all functional languages, a key feature of Standard ML is the function, which is used for abstraction. The factorial function can be expressed as follows:
fun factorial n = 
 if n = 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n - 1)
===Type inference===
An SML compiler must infer the static type without user-supplied type annotations. It has to deduce that is only used with integer expressions, and must therefore itself be an integer, and that all terminal expressions are integer expressions.

===Declarative definitions===
The same function can be expressed with clausal function definitions where the &quot;if&quot;-&quot;then&quot;-&quot;else&quot; conditional is replaced with templates of the factorial function evaluated for specific values:
fun factorial 0 = 1
 | factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
===Imperative definitions===
or iteratively:
fun factorial n = let val i = ref n and acc = ref 1 in
 while !i &gt; 0 do (acc := !acc * !i; i := !i - 1); !acc
end
===Lambda functions===
or as a lambda function:
val rec factorial = fn 0 =&gt; 1 | n =&gt; n * factorial (n - 1)
Here, the keyword introduces a binding of an identifier to a value, introduces an anonymous function, and allows the definition to be self-referential.

===Local definitions===
The encapsulation of an invariant-preserving tail-recursive tight loop with one or more accumulator parameters within an invariant-free outer function, as seen here, is a common idiom in Standard ML.

Using a local function, it can be rewritten in a more efficient tail-recursive style:
local
 fun loop (0, acc) = acc
 | loop (m, acc) = loop (m - 1, m * acc)
in
 fun factorial n = loop (n, 1)
end
===Type synonyms===
A type synonym is defined with the keyword . Here is a type synonym for points on a plane, and functions computing the distances between two points, and the area of a triangle with the given corners as per Heron&#x27;s formula. (These definitions will be used in subsequent examples).
type loc = real * real

fun square (x : real) = x * x

fun dist (x, y) (x&#x27;, y&#x27;) =
 Math.sqrt (square (x&#x27; - x) + square (y&#x27; - y))

fun heron (a, b, c) = let
 val x = dist a b
 val y = dist b c
 val z = dist a c
 val s = (x + y + z) / 2.0
 in
 Math.sqrt (s * (s - x) * (s - y) * (s - z))
 end
===Algebraic datatypes===
Standard ML provides strong support for algebraic datatypes (ADT). A data type can be thought of as a disjoint union of tuples (or a &quot;sum of products&quot;). They are easy to define and easy to use, largely because of pattern matching, and most Standard ML implementations&#x27; pattern-exhaustiveness checking and pattern redundancy checking.

In object-oriented programming languages, a disjoint union can be expressed as class hierarchies. However, in contrast to class hierarchies, ADTs are closed. Thus, the extensibility of ADTs is orthogonal to the extensibility of class hierarchies. Class hierarchies can be extended with new subclasses which implement the same interface, while the functions of ADTs can be extended for the fixed set of constructors. See expression problem.

A datatype is defined with the keyword , as in:
datatype shape
 = Circle of loc * real (* center and radius *)
 | Square of loc * real (* upper-left corner and side length; axis-aligned *)
 | Triangle of loc * loc * loc (* corners *)
Note that a type synonym cannot be recursive; datatypes are necessary to define recursive constructors. (This is not at issue in this example.)

===Pattern matching===
Patterns are matched in the order in which they are defined. C programmers can use tagged unions, dispatching on tag values, to do what ML does with datatypes and pattern matching. Nevertheless, while a C program decorated with appropriate checks will, in a sense, be as robust as the corresponding ML program, those checks will of necessity be dynamic; ML&#x27;s static checks provide strong guarantees about the correctness of the program at compile time.

Function arguments can be defined as patterns as follows:
fun area (Circle (_, r)) = Math.pi * square r
 | area (Square (_, s)) = square s
 | area (Triangle p) = heron p (* see above *)
The so-called &quot;clausal form&quot; of function definition, where arguments are defined as patterns, is merely syntactic sugar for a case expression:
fun area shape = case shape of
 Circle (_, r) =&gt; Math.pi * square r
 | Square (_, s) =&gt; square s
 | Triangle p =&gt; heron p
====Exhaustiveness checking====
Pattern-exhaustiveness checking will make sure that each constructor of the datatype is matched by at least one pattern. 

The following pattern is not exhaustive:
fun center (Circle (c, _)) = c
 | center (Square ((x, y), s)) = (x + s / 2.0, y + s / 2.0)
There is no pattern for the case in the function. The compiler will issue a warning that the case expression is not exhaustive, and if a is passed to this function at runtime, will be raised.

====Redundancy checking====
The pattern in the second clause of the following (meaningless) function is redundant:
fun f (Circle ((x, y), r)) = x + y
 | f (Circle _) = 1.0
 | f _ = 0.0
Any value that would match the pattern in the second clause would also match the pattern in the first clause, so the second clause is unreachable. Therefore, this definition as a whole exhibits redundancy, and causes a compile-time warning.

The following function definition is exhaustive and not redundant:
val hasCorners = fn (Circle _) =&gt; false | _ =&gt; true
If control gets past the first pattern (), we know the shape must be either a or a . In either of those cases, we know the shape has corners, so we can return without discerning the actual shape.

===Higher-order functions===
Functions can consume functions as arguments:
fun map f (x, y) = (f x, f y)

Functions can produce functions as return values:
fun constant k = (fn _ =&gt; k)

Functions can also both consume and produce functions:
fun compose (f, g) = (fn x =&gt; f (g x))

The function from the basis library is one of the most commonly used higher-order functions in Standard ML:

fun map _ [] = []
 | map f (x :: xs) = f x :: map f xs
A more efficient implementation with tail-recursive :

fun map f = List.rev o List.foldl (fn (x, acc) =&gt; f x :: acc) []
===Exceptions===
Exceptions are raised with the keyword and handled with the pattern matching construct. The exception system can implement non-local exit; this optimization technique is suitable for functions like the following.
local
 exception Zero;
 val p = fn (0, _) =&gt; raise Zero | (a, b) =&gt; a * b
in
 fun prod xs = List.foldl p 1 xs handle Zero =&gt; 0
end
When is raised, control leaves the function altogether. Consider the alternative: the value 0 would be returned, it would be multiplied by the next integer in the list, the resulting value (inevitably 0) would be returned, and so on. The raising of the exception allows control to skip over the entire chain of frames and avoid the associated computation. Note the use of the underscore () as a wildcard pattern.

The same optimization can be obtained with a tail call.
local
 fun p a (0 :: _) = 0
 | p a (x :: xs) = p (a * x) xs
 | p a [] = a
in
 val prod = p 1
end
===Module system===
Standard ML&#x27;s advanced module system allows programs to be decomposed into hierarchically organized &quot;structures&quot; of logically related type and value definitions. Modules provide not only namespace control but also abstraction, in the sense that they allow the definition of abstract data types. Three main syntactic constructs comprise the module system: signatures, structures and functors.

====Signatures====
A &quot;signature&quot; is an interface, usually thought of as a type for a structure; it specifies the names of all entities provided by the structure, the arity of each type component, the type of each value component, and the signature of each substructure. The definitions of type components are optional; type components whose definitions are hidden are &quot;abstract types&quot;.

For example, the signature for a queue may be:
signature QUEUE = sig
 type &#x27;a queue
 exception QueueError;
 val empty : &#x27;a queue
 val isEmpty : &#x27;a queue -&gt; bool
 val singleton : &#x27;a -&gt; &#x27;a queue
 val fromList : &#x27;a list -&gt; &#x27;a queue
 val insert : &#x27;a * &#x27;a queue -&gt; &#x27;a queue
 val peek : &#x27;a queue -&gt; &#x27;a
 val remove : &#x27;a queue -&gt; &#x27;a * &#x27;a queue
end
This signature describes a module that provides a polymorphic type , , and values that define basic operations on queues.

====Structures====
A &quot;structure&quot; is a module; it consists of a collection of types, exceptions, values and structures (called &quot;substructures&quot;) packaged together into a logical unit.

A queue structure can be implemented as follows:
structure TwoListQueue :&gt; QUEUE = struct
 type &#x27;a queue = &#x27;a list * &#x27;a list

 exception QueueError;

 val empty = ([], [])

 fun isEmpty ([], []) = true
 | isEmpty _ = false

 fun singleton a = ([], [a])

 fun fromList a = ([], a)

 fun insert (a, ([], [])) = singleton a
 | insert (a, (ins, outs)) = (a :: ins, outs)

 fun peek (_, []) = raise QueueError
 | peek (ins, outs) = List.hd outs

 fun remove (_, []) = raise QueueError
 | remove (ins, [a]) = (a, ([], List.rev ins))
 | remove (ins, a :: outs) = (a, (ins, outs))
end
This definition declares that implements . Furthermore, the &quot;opaque ascription&quot; denoted by states that any types which are not defined in the signature (i.e. ) should be abstract, meaning that the definition of a queue as a pair of lists is not visible outside the module. The structure implements all of the definitions in the signature.

The types and values in a structure can be accessed with &quot;dot notation&quot;:
val q : string TwoListQueue.queue = TwoListQueue.empty
val q&#x27; = TwoListQueue.insert (Real.toString Math.pi, q)
====Functors====
A &quot;functor&quot; is a function from structures to structures; that is, a functor accepts one or more arguments, which are usually structures of a given signature, and produces a structure as its result. Functors are used to implement generic data structures and algorithms.

One popular algorithm for breadth-first search of trees makes use of queues. Here is a version of that algorithm parameterized over an abstract queue structure:
(* after Okasaki, ICFP, 2000 *)
functor BFS (Q: QUEUE) = struct
 datatype &#x27;a tree = E | T of &#x27;a * &#x27;a tree * &#x27;a tree

 local
 fun bfsQ q = if Q.isEmpty q then [] else search (Q.remove q)
 and search (E, q) = bfsQ q
 | search (T (x, l, r), q) = x :: bfsQ (insert (insert q l) r)
 and insert q a = Q.insert (a, q)
 in
 fun bfs t = bfsQ (Q.singleton t)
 end
end

structure QueueBFS = BFS (TwoListQueue)
Within , the representation of the queue is not visible. More concretely, there is no way to select the first list in the two-list queue, if that is indeed the representation being used. This data abstraction mechanism makes the breadth-first search truly agnostic to the queue&#x27;s implementation. This is in general desirable; in this case, the queue structure can safely maintain any logical invariants on which its correctness depends behind the bulletproof wall of abstraction.

==Code examples==
Snippets of SML code are most easily studied by entering them into an interactive top-level.

===Hello, world!===
The following is a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:

===Algorithms===
====Insertion sort====
Insertion sort for (ascending) can be expressed concisely as follows:
fun insert (x, []) = [x] | insert (x, h :: t) = sort x (h, t)
and sort x (h, t) = if x &lt; h then [x, h] @ t else h :: insert (x, t)
val insertionsort = List.foldl insert []
====Mergesort====
Here, the classic mergesort algorithm is implemented in three functions: split, merge and mergesort. Also note the absence of types, with the exception of the syntax and which signify lists. This code will sort lists of any type, so long as a consistent ordering function is defined. Using Hindley–Milner type inference, the types of all variables can be inferred, even complicated types such as that of the function .

Split

 is implemented with a stateful closure which alternates between and , ignoring the input:
fun alternator {} = let val state = ref true
 in fn a =&gt; !state before state := not (!state) end

(* Split a list into near-halves which will either be the same length,
 * or the first will have one more element than the other.
 * Runs in O(n) time, where n = |xs|.
fun split xs = List.partition (alternator {}) xs
Merge

Merge uses a local function loop for efficiency. The inner is defined in terms of cases: when both lists are non-empty () and when one list is empty ().

This function merges two sorted lists into one sorted list. Note how the accumulator is built backwards, then reversed before being returned. This is a common technique, since is represented as a linked list; this technique requires more clock time, but the asymptotics are not worse.
(* Merge two ordered lists using the order cmp.
 * Pre: each list must already be ordered per cmp.
 * Runs in O(n) time, where n = |xs| + |ys|.
fun merge cmp (xs, []) = xs
 | merge cmp (xs, y :: ys) = let
 fun loop (a, acc) (xs, []) = List.revAppend (a :: acc, xs)
 | loop (a, acc) (xs, y :: ys) =
 if cmp (a, y)
 then loop (y, a :: acc) (ys, xs)
 else loop (a, y :: acc) (xs, ys)
 in
 loop (y, []) (ys, xs)
 end
Mergesort

The main function:
fun ap f (x, y) = (f x, f y)

(* Sort a list in according to the given ordering operation cmp.
 * Runs in O(n log n) time, where n = |xs|.
fun mergesort cmp [] = []
 | mergesort cmp [x] = [x]
 | mergesort cmp xs = (merge cmp o ap (mergesort cmp) o split) xs
====Quicksort====
Quicksort can be expressed as follows. is a closure that consumes an order operator .
infix «

fun quicksort (op «) = let
 fun part p = List.partition (fn x =&gt; x « p)
 fun sort [] = []
 | sort (p :: xs) = join p (part p xs)
 and join p (l, r) = sort l @ p :: sort r
 in
 sort
 end
===Expression interpreter===
Note the relative ease with which a small expression language can be defined and processed:
exception TyErr;

datatype ty = IntTy | BoolTy

fun unify (IntTy, IntTy) = IntTy
 | unify (BoolTy, BoolTy) = BoolTy
 | unify (_, _) = raise TyErr

datatype exp
 = True
 | False
 | Int of int
 | Not of exp
 | Add of exp * exp
 | If of exp * exp * exp

fun infer True = BoolTy
 | infer False = BoolTy
 | infer (Int _) = IntTy
 | infer (Not e) = (assert e BoolTy; BoolTy)
 | infer (Add (a, b)) = (assert a IntTy; assert b IntTy; IntTy)
 | infer (If (e, t, f)) = (assert e BoolTy; unify (infer t, infer f))
and assert e t = unify (infer e, t)

fun eval True = True
 | eval False = False
 | eval (Int n) = Int n
 | eval (Not e) = if eval e = True then False else True
 | eval (Add (a, b)) = (case (eval a, eval b) of (Int x, Int y) =&gt; Int (x + y))
 | eval (If (e, t, f)) = eval (if eval e = True then t else f)

fun run e = (infer e; SOME (eval e)) handle TyErr =&gt; NONE
Example usage on well-typed and ill-typed expressions:

val SOME (Int 3) = run (Add (Int 1, Int 2)) (* well-typed *)
val NONE = run (If (Not (Int 1), True, False)) (* ill-typed *)
===Arbitrary-precision integers===
The module provides arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic. Moreover, integer literals may be used as arbitrary-precision integers without the programmer having to do anything.

The following program implements an arbitrary-precision factorial function:

===Partial application===
Curried functions have many applications, such as eliminating redundant code. For example, a module may require functions of type , but it is more convenient to write functions of type where there is a fixed relationship between the objects of type and . A function of type can factor out this commonality. This is an example of the adapter pattern.

In this example, computes the numerical derivative of a given function at point :
- fun d delta f x = (f (x + delta) - f (x - delta)) / (2.0 * delta)
val d = fn : real -&gt; (real -&gt; real) -&gt; real -&gt; real
The type of indicates that it maps a &quot;float&quot; onto a function with the type . This allows us to partially apply arguments, known as currying. In this case, function can be specialised by partially applying it with the argument . A good choice for when using this algorithm is the cube root of the machine epsilon.
- val d&#x27; = d 1E~8;
val d&#x27; = fn : (real -&gt; real) -&gt; real -&gt; real
The inferred type indicates that expects a function with the type as its first argument. We can compute an approximation to the derivative of formula_1 at formula_2. The correct answer is formula_3.
- d&#x27; (fn x =&gt; x * x * x - x - 1.0) 3.0;
val it = 25.9999996644 : real
==Libraries==
===Standard===
The Basis Library has been standardized and ships with most implementations. It provides modules for trees, arrays, and other data structures, and input/output and system interfaces.

===Third party===
For numerical computing, a Matrix module exists (but is currently broken), https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/pscico/pscico/src/matrix/README.html.

For graphics, cairo-sml is an open source interface to the Cairo graphics library. For machine learning, a library for graphical models exists.

==Implementations==
Implementations of Standard ML include the following:

Standard
* HaMLet: a Standard ML interpreter that aims to be an accurate and accessible reference implementation of the standard
* MLton (mlton.org): a whole-program optimizing compiler which strictly conforms to the Definition and produces very fast code compared to other ML implementations, including backends for LLVM and C
* Moscow ML: a light-weight implementation, based on the Caml Light runtime engine which implements the full Standard ML language, including modules and much of the basis library
* Poly/ML: a full implementation of Standard ML that produces fast code and supports multicore hardware (via Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) threads); its runtime system performs parallel garbage collection and online sharing of immutable substructures.
* Standard ML of New Jersey (smlnj.org): a full compiler, with associated libraries, tools, an interactive shell, and documentation with support for Concurrent ML
* SML.NET: a Standard ML compiler for the Common Language Runtime with extensions for linking with other .NET framework code
* ML Kit : an implementation based very closely on the Definition, integrating a garbage collector (which can be disabled) and region-based memory management with automatic inference of regions, aiming to support real-time applications

Derivative
* Alice: an interpreter for Standard ML by Saarland University with support for parallel programming using futures, lazy evaluation, distributed computing via remote procedure calls and constraint programming
* SML#: an extension of SML providing record polymorphism and C language interoperability. It is a conventional native compiler and its name is &quot;not&quot; an allusion to running on the .NET framework
* SOSML: an implementation written in TypeScript, supporting most of the SML language and select parts of the basis library

Research
* CakeML is a REPL version of ML with formally verified runtime and translation to assembler.
* Isabelle (Isabelle/ML ) integrates parallel Poly/ML into an interactive theorem prover, with a sophisticated IDE (based on jEdit) for official Standard ML (SML&#x27;97), the Isabelle/ML dialect, and the proof language. Starting with Isabelle2016, there is also a source-level debugger for ML.
* Poplog implements a version of Standard ML, along with Common Lisp and Prolog, allowing mixed language programming; all are implemented in POP-11, which is compiled incrementally.
* TILT is a full certifying compiler for Standard ML which uses typed intermediate languages to optimize code and ensure correctness, and can compile to typed assembly language.

All of these implementations are open-source and freely available. Most are implemented themselves in Standard ML. There are no longer any commercial implementations; Harlequin, now defunct, once produced a commercial IDE and compiler called MLWorks which passed on to Xanalys and was later open-sourced after it was acquired by Ravenbrook Limited on April 26, 2013.

==Major projects using SML==
The IT University of Copenhagen&#x27;s entire enterprise architecture is implemented in around 100,000 lines of SML, including staff records, payroll, course administration and feedback, student project management, and web-based self-service interfaces.

The proof assistants HOL4, Isabelle, LEGO, and Twelf are written in Standard ML. It is also used by compiler writers and integrated circuit designers such as ARM.

<text>Gerald Sheldon Herman (July 10, 1931December 26, 2019) was an American composer and lyricist, known for his work in Broadway theatre.

One of the most commercially successful Broadway songwriters of his time, Herman was the composer and lyricist for a number of hit musicals, starting in the 1960s, that were characterized by an upbeat and optimistic outlook and what Herman called &quot;the simple, hummable showtune&quot;. His shows include &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1964), at one time the longest-running musical in Broadway history, which also produced the hit title song for Louis Armstrong; &quot;Mame&quot; (1966), a vehicle for Angela Lansbury; and &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1984), the first hit Broadway musical about a gay couple.

In 2009, Herman received the Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre. He was a recipient of the 2010 Kennedy Center Honors.

==Early life==
Herman was born in Manhattan and raised in Jersey City, New Jersey, the only child of musically inclined, middle-class Jewish parents. He learned to play piano at an early age, and he frequently attended Broadway musicals.

Herman&#x27;s father Harry was a gym teacher and in the summer worked in the Catskill Mountains hotels. His mother Ruth (née Sachs) also worked in the hotels as a singer, pianist, and children&#x27;s teacher, and eventually became an English teacher. Herman told &quot;People Magazine&quot; in 1986 that his mother, who died in 1954, long before his success on Broadway, &quot;was glamorous like Mame and witty like Dolly.&quot;

After marrying, his parents lived in Jersey City and continued to work in the summers in various camps until they became head counselors and finally ran Stissing Lake Camp in the small town of Pine Plains, New York, in the Taconic Mountains. Herman spent all of his summers there, from age 6 to 23. It was at camp that he first became involved in theatrical productions, as director of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;. Herman graduated from Jersey City&#x27;s Henry Snyder High School.

At age 17, Herman was introduced to Frank Loesser who, after hearing material he had written, urged him to continue composing. He left the Parsons School of Design to attend the University of Miami, which has one of the nation&#x27;s most avant garde theater departments. While an undergraduate student at the University of Miami, Herman produced, wrote and directed a college musical called &quot;Sketchbook&quot;. It was scheduled to run for three performances, but the show was so popular it ran for an additional 17 performances.
Herman belonged to the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.

Herman graduated from the University of Miami in 1953 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama and received a Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1980.

==Early career==
Following his graduation from the University of Miami in 1953, Herman moved to New York City, where he produced the Off-Broadway revue &quot;I Feel Wonderful&quot;, which was made up of material he had written at the university. It opened at the Theatre de Lys in Greenwich Village on October 18, 1954, and ran for 48 performances. It was his only show his mother saw; she died of cancer at the age of forty-four in December 1954. Herman said &quot;I went into serious grieving.&quot;

In 1957, Herman approached the owner of a West Fourth Street jazz club called the Showplace and asked to put on a revue. As well as supplying the music, Herman wrote the book and directed the one-hour revue, called &quot;Nightcap&quot;. He asked his friend, Phyllis Newman, to do movement and dance and it featured Charles Nelson Reilly (who later co-starred in &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;). The show opened in May 1958 and ran for two years.

Herman next collected enough original material to put together an Off-Broadway revue called &quot;Parade&quot; in 1960. Herman directed with choreography by Richard Tone. The cast included Charles Nelson Reilly and Dody Goodman. It first opened at the Showplace and, expanded, moved to the Players Theatre in January 1960.

==Broadway career==
In 1960, Herman made his Broadway debut with the revue &quot;From A to Z&quot;, which featured contributions from newcomers Woody Allen and Fred Ebb as well. That same year producer Gerard Oestreicher approached him after seeing a performance of &quot;Parade&quot;, and asked if he would be interested in composing the score for a show about the founding of the state of Israel. The result was his first full-fledged Broadway musical, &quot;Milk and Honey &quot;in 1961. The show, about American tourists in Israel, starred Robert Weede, Mimi Benzell and Molly Picon. It received respectable reviews, was nominated for a Tony award, and ran for 543 performances.

Herman met playwright Tad Mosel in 1960 and they collaborated on an Off-Broadway musical adaptation of Mosel&#x27;s 1953 television play, &quot;Madame Aphrodite&quot;. The musical of the same name, which starred Nancy Andrews in the title role, opened at the Orpheum Theatre in December 1961 but closed after 13 performances. The show has never been performed since. The failure of the musical hurt Herman, who felt that the direction and casting had not worked, but described his decision to make it as a &quot;very brave thing for me to do...It was a dark piece, something more suited to early Sondheim than me&quot;.

=== &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; ===

In 1964, producer David Merrick united Herman with musical actress Carol Channing and librettist Michael Stewart for a project that was to become one of his more successful, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;. The original production ran for 2,844 performances, the longest running musical for its time, and was later revived three times. Although facing stiff competition from &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; swept the Tony Awards that season, winning 10, a record that remained unbroken for 37 years, until &quot;The Producers&quot; won 12 Tonys in 2001.

=== &quot;Mame&quot; ===

In 1966, Herman&#x27;s next musical was the hit &quot;Mame&quot; starring Angela Lansbury, which introduced a string of Herman standards, most notably the ballad &quot;If He Walked Into My Life&quot;, the holiday favorite &quot;We Need a Little Christmas&quot;, and the title tune.

=== 1969–1980 ===
Although not commercial successes, &quot;Dear World&quot; (1969) starring Angela Lansbury, &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; (1974) starring Robert Preston and Bernadette Peters, and &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; (1979) starring Joel Grey are noted for their interesting concepts and their melodic, memorable scores. Herman considers &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot;, also written in collaboration with Michael Stewart, his personal favorite score with later composition &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; in a close second. Both &quot;Dear World&quot; and &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; have developed a cult following among Broadway aficionados.

=== &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; ===

In 1983, Herman had his third hit with &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; starring George Hearn and Gene Barry, a show that was notable for being one of the first hit Broadway musicals centered around a gay couple. The musical was tried out in Boston, where Herman worried:

Ticket sales were strong for its Boston tryout; a two-week extension required the box office to remain open for 36 hours straight to handle the demand. Advance sales for its Broadway debut at the Palace Theatre were described as &quot;something approximating outright pandemonium.&quot; &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; won the Tony Award for Best Musical (1983), later became the first musical to win the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical twice (2005 and 2010).

===&quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot; ===

A revue of Herman&#x27;s work ran on Broadway from December 1985 to April 1986: &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot; featured Dorothy Loudon, Leslie Uggams, and Chita Rivera.

Many of Herman&#x27;s show tunes have become pop standards. &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; was a No. 1 hit in the United States for Louis Armstrong, knocking The Beatles from No. 1 in 1964 after a 14-week run at the top (&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love.&quot;). A French recording by Petula Clark charted in the Top Ten in both Canada and France.

&quot;If He Walked into My Life&quot; from &quot;Mame&quot; was recorded by Eydie Gormé, winning her a Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Female in 1967. &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; from &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; was recorded by Gloria Gaynor.

Other well known Herman showtunes include &quot;Shalom&quot; from &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;; &quot;Before the Parade Passes By&quot;, &quot;Put On Your Sunday Clothes&quot;, and &quot;It Only Takes a Moment&quot; from &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s Today!&quot;, &quot;Open a New Window&quot;, &quot;We Need a Little Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; from &quot;Mame&quot;; and &quot;Tap Your Troubles Away&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Send Roses&quot; and &quot;Time Heals Everything&quot; from &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot;. His &quot;I Am What I Am,&quot; written for &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, became a gay pride anthem.

==Impact and recognition==
According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Herman&#x27;s 1983 &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, which centered on a gay couple whose son is about to marry the daughter of a conservative family, &quot;arrived during the height of the AIDS epidemic and helped put gay life into the cultural mainstream at a time when many gay men were being stigmatized.&quot;

Herman is the only composer/lyricist to have had three original productions open on Broadway at the same time, from February to May 1969: &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, &quot;Mame&quot; , and &quot;Dear World&quot;. He was the first (of two) composers/lyricists to have three musicals run more than 1500 consecutive performances on Broadway (the other being Stephen Schwartz): &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (2,844 performances), &quot;Mame&quot; (1,508), and &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1,761). Herman is honored by a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at the 7000 block of Hollywood Boulevard.

The Jerry Herman Ring Theatre, the campus theater at the University of Miami, his alma mater, is named in his honor. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1982.

Herman&#x27;s work has been the subject of two popular musical revues, &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot; conceived by Larry Alford, and &quot;Showtune&quot; (2003) conceived by Paul Gilger.

A 90-minute documentary about his life and career, &quot;Words and Music by Jerry Herman&quot;, by filmmaker Amber Edwards, was screened in 2007 and then broadcast on PBS.
 In the 2008 animated film &quot;WALL-E&quot;, Herman&#x27;s music from &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; is a theme for the character WALL-E.

In 1989, American-playwright Natalie Gaupp wrote a short play titled &quot;The Jerry Herman Center&quot;. The play is a comedy which portrays the lives of several patients in &quot;The Jerry Herman Center for Musical Theatre Addiction.&quot; In 2012, Jason Graae and Faith Prince collaborated on &quot;The Prince and the Showboy&quot;, a show which pays tribute to Herman; Graae worked extensively with Herman and described him as &quot;a survivor of the highest degree [who] lives his life as an eternal optimist.&quot;

In 2010, he received a Kennedy Center Honor. Introduced by Angela Lansbury, there were performances by Carol Channing, Matthew Morrison, Christine Baranski and Christine Ebersole, Laura Benanti, Sutton Foster, Matthew Bomer and Kelli O&#x27; Hara, 2002 Kennedy Center Honoree Chita Rivera, an unknown choir that included the Gay Mens Chorus of Washington, and Lansbury. Also honored were talk show host/actress Oprah Winfrey, dancer/choreographer Bill T. Jones, country singer-songwriter Merle Haggard, and singer-songwriter/musician Paul McCartney.

==Personal life and death==
Having a flair for decorating in the 1970s, Herman took a break from composition after the failure of &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot;. &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; wrote about the firehouse he renovated and he also redecorated other houses and sold them. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Herman decorated three dozen homes. Herman reportedly listed his West Hollywood condominium apartment for sale early in 2013.

Herman was openly gay, and at the time of his death was partnered with Terry Marler, a real estate broker.

Herman was diagnosed HIV-positive in 1985. As noted in the &quot;Words and Music&quot; PBS documentary, &quot;He is one of the fortunate ones who survived to see experimental drug therapies take hold and was still, as one of his lyrics proclaims, &#x27;alive and well and thriving&#x27; over a quarter of a century later.&quot;

Herman&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Showtune&quot;, was published in 1996.

He died at a hospital in Miami on December 26, 2019, at age 88.

<text>Millipedes (originating from the Latin , &quot;thousand&quot;, and , &quot;foot&quot;) are a group of arthropods that are characterised by having two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments; they are known scientifically as the class Diplopoda, the name derived from this feature. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name &quot;millipede&quot; derives from Latin for &quot;thousand feet&quot;, no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of &quot;Eumillipes persephone&quot;, which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures.

Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating decaying leaves and other dead plant matter; however, some eat fungi or drink plant fluid. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests. Millipedes can be an unwanted nuisance particularly in greenhouses where they can potentially cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves with a variety of chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Its primary defence mechanism is to curl into a tight coil, thereby protecting its legs and other vital delicate areas on the body behind a hard exoskeleton. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.

First appearing in the Silurian period, millipedes are some of the oldest known land animals. Some members of prehistoric groups, such as &quot;Arthropleura&quot;, grew to over ; the largest modern species reach maximum lengths of . The longest extant species is the giant African millipede (&quot;Archispirostreptus gigas&quot;).

Among myriapods, millipedes have traditionally been considered most closely related to the tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are venomous, carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. 

The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.

==Etymology and names==
The term &quot;millipede&quot; is widespread in popular and scientific literature, but among North American scientists, the term &quot;milliped&quot; (without the terminal e) is also used. Other vernacular names include &quot;thousand-legger&quot; or simply &quot;diplopod&quot;. The science of millipede biology and taxonomy is called diplopodology: the study of diplopods.

==Classification==

Approximately 12,000 millipede species have been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.

The living members of the Diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two subclasses. The basal subclass Penicillata contains a single order, Polyxenida (bristle millipedes). All other millipedes belong to the subclass Chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses: Pentazonia, containing the short-bodied pill millipedes, and Helminthomorpha (worm-like millipedes), containing the great majority of the species.

===Outline of classification===

The higher-level classification of millipedes is presented below, based on Shear, 2011, and Shear &amp; Edgecombe, 2010 (extinct groups). Recent cladistic and molecular studies have challenged the traditional classification schemes above, and in particular the position of the orders Siphoniulida and Polyzoniida is not yet well established. The placement and positions of extinct groups (†) known only from fossils is tentative and not fully resolved. After each name is listed the author citation: the name of the person who coined the name or defined the group, even if not at the current rank.

===Evolution===
Millipedes are among the first animals to have colonised land during the Silurian period. Early forms probably ate mosses and primitive vascular plants. There are two major groups of millipedes whose members are all extinct: the Archipolypoda (&quot;ancient, many-legged ones&quot;) which contain the oldest known terrestrial animals, and Arthropleuridea, which contain the largest known land invertebrates. &quot;Pneumodesmus newmani&quot; is the earliest member of the millipedes from the late Wenlock epoch of the late Silurian around , or early Lochkovian of the early Devonian around 414 million years ago, known from long fragment and has clear evidence of spiracles (breathing holes) attesting to its air-breathing habits. Other early fossils of millipedes are &quot;Kampecaris obanensis&quot; and &quot;Archidesmus&quot; sp. from 425 millions years ago in the late Silurian. During the Carboniferous, &quot;Arthropleura&quot; became the largest known land-dwelling invertebrate on record, length exceeding . Reason of gigantism of &quot;Arthropleura&quot; is not clearly known, previously considered that is due to high oxygen levels, but later studies consider that is more likely because of lack of competition. Millipedes also exhibit the earliest evidence of chemical defence, as some Devonian fossils have defensive gland openings called ozopores.

===Living groups===

The history of scientific millipede classification began with Carl Linnaeus, who in his 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, 1758, named seven species of &quot;Julus&quot; as &quot;Insecta Aptera&quot; (wingless insects). In 1802, the French zoologist Pierre André Latreille proposed the name Chilognatha as the first group of what are now the Diplopoda, and in 1840 the German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt produced the first detailed classification. The name Diplopoda itself was coined in 1844 by the French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville. From 1890 to 1940, millipede taxonomy was driven by relatively few researchers at any given time, with major contributions by Carl Attems, Karl Wilhelm Verhoeff and Ralph Vary Chamberlin, who each described over 1,000 species, as well as Orator F. Cook, Filippo Silvestri, R. I. Pocock, and Henry W. Brölemann. This was a period when the science of diplopodology flourished: rates of species descriptions were on average the highest in history, sometimes exceeding 300 per year.

In 1971, the Dutch biologist C. A. W. Jeekel published a comprehensive listing of all known millipede genera and families described between 1758 and 1957 in his &quot;Nomenclator Generum et Familiarum Diplopodorum&quot;, a work credited as launching the &quot;modern era&quot; of millipede taxonomy. In 1980, the American biologist Richard L. Hoffman published a classification of millipedes which recognized the Penicillata, Pentazonia, and Helminthomorpha, and the first phylogenetic analysis of millipede orders using modern cladistic methods was published in 1984 by Henrik Enghoff of Denmark. A 2003 classification by the American myriapodologist Rowland Shelley is similar to the one originally proposed by Verhoeff, and remains the currently accepted classification scheme (shown below), despite more recent molecular studies proposing conflicting relationships. A 2011 summary of millipede family diversity by William A. Shear placed the order Siphoniulida within the larger group Nematophora.

===Fossil record===
In addition to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups and to each other is controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class, although work in the early 21st century established the group as a subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups. Extinct groups are indicated with a dagger (†). The extinct order Zosterogrammida, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.


===Relation to other myriapods===

Although the relationships of millipede orders are still the subject of debate, the class Diplopoda as a whole is considered a monophyletic group of arthropods: all millipedes are more closely related to each other than to any other arthropods. Diplopoda is a class within the arthropod subphylum Myriapoda, the myriapods, which includes centipedes (class Chilopoda) as well as the lesser-known pauropods (class Pauropoda) and symphylans (class Symphyla). Within myriapods, the closest relatives or sister group of millipedes has long been considered the pauropods, which also have a collum and diplosegments.

===Distinction from centipedes===
The differences between millipedes and centipedes are a common question from the general public. Both groups of myriapods share similarities, such as long, multi-segmented bodies, many legs, a single pair of antennae, and the presence of postantennal organs, but have many differences and distinct evolutionary histories, as the most recent common ancestor of centipedes and millipedes lived around 450 to 475 million years ago in the Silurian. The head alone exemplifies the differences; millipedes have short, geniculate (elbowed) antennae for probing the substrate, a pair of robust mandibles and a single pair of maxillae fused into a lip; centipedes have long, threadlike antennae, a pair of small mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and a pair of large poison claws.

==Characteristics==
Millipedes come in a variety of body shapes and sizes, ranging from to around in length, and can have as few as eleven to over three hundred segments. They are generally black or brown in colour, although there are a few brightly coloured species, and some have aposematic colouring to warn that they are toxic. Species of &quot;Motyxia&quot; produce cyanide as a chemical defence and are bioluminescent.

Body styles vary greatly between major millipede groups. In the basal subclass Penicillata, consisting of the tiny bristle millipedes, the exoskeleton is soft and uncalcified, and is covered in prominent setae or bristles. All other millipedes, belonging to the subclass Chilognatha, have a hardened exoskeleton. The chilognaths are in turn divided into two infraclasses: the Pentazonia, containing relatively short-bodied groups such as pill millipedes, and the Helminthomorpha (&quot;worm-like&quot; millipedes), which contains the vast majority of species, with long, many-segmented bodies.

They have also lost the gene that codes for the JHAMTl enzyme, which is responsible for catalysing the last step of the production of a juvenile hormone that regulates the development and reproduction in other arthropods like crustaceans, centipedes and insects.
===Head===
The head of a millipede is typically rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large mandibles in front of a plate-like structure called a gnathochilarium (&quot;jaw lip&quot;). The head contains a single pair of antennae with seven or eight segments and a group of sensory cones at the tip. Many orders also possess a pair of sensory organs known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral to the base of the antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some centipedes, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the surrounding environment.

Millipede eyes consist of several simple flat-lensed ocelli arranged in a group or patch on each side of the head. These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire orders Polydesmida, Siphoniulida, Glomeridesmida, Siphonophorida and Platydesmida, and cave-dwelling millipedes such as &quot;Causeyella&quot; and &quot;Trichopetalum&quot;, had ancestors that could see but have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind.

===Body===
Millipede bodies may be flattened or cylindrical, and are composed of numerous metameric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of four chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, such as Merocheta and Juliformia, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, impregnated with calcium salts. Because they can&#x27;t close their permanently open spiracles and most species lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and with a few exceptions must spend most of their time in moist or humid environments.

The first segment behind the head is legless and known as a collum (from the Latin for neck or collar). The second, third, and fourth body segments bear a single pair of legs each and are known as &quot;haplosegments&quot; (the three haplosegments are sometimes referred to as a &quot;thorax&quot;). The remaining segments, from the fifth to the posterior, are properly known as diplosegments or double segments, formed by the fusion of two embryonic segments. Each diplosegment bears two pairs of legs, rather than just one as in centipedes. In some millipedes, the last few segments may be legless. The terms &quot;segment&quot; or &quot;body ring&quot; are often used interchangeably to refer to both haplo- and diplosegments. The final segment is known as the telson and consists of a legless preanal ring, a pair of anal valves (closeable plates around the anus), and a small scale below the anus.

Millipedes in several orders have keel-like extensions of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede more difficult for predators to swallow.

The legs are composed of seven segments, and attach on the underside of the body. The legs of an individual are generally rather similar to each other, although often longer in males than females, and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged first pair of legs. The most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction, discussed below. Despite the common name, no millipede was known to have 1,000 legs until 2021: common species have between 34 and 400 legs, and the record is held by &quot;Eumillipes persephone&quot;, with individuals possessing up to 1,306 legs – more than any other creature on Earth.
===Internal organs===
Millipedes breathe through two pairs of spiracles located ventrally on each segment near the base of the legs. Each opens into an internal pouch, and connects to a system of tracheae. The heart runs the entire length of the body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The excretory organs are two pairs of malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple tube with two pairs of salivary glands to help digest the food.

==Reproduction and growth==
Millipedes show a diversity of mating styles and structures. In the basal order Polyxenida (bristle millipedes), mating is indirect: males deposit spermatophores onto webs they secrete with special glands, and the spermatophores are subsequently picked up by females. In all other millipede groups, males possess one or two pairs of modified legs called gonopods which are used to transfer sperm to the female during copulation. The location of the gonopods differs between groups: in males of the Pentazonia they are located at the rear of the body and known as telopods and may also function in grasping females, while in the Helminthomorpha – the vast majority of species – they are located on the seventh body segment. A few species are parthenogenetic, having few, if any, males.
Gonopods occur in a diversity of shapes and sizes, and in the range from closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.

The genital openings (gonopores) of both sexes are located on the underside of the third body segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male by one or two penes which deposit the sperm packets onto the gonopods. In the female, the genital pores open into paired small sacs called cyphopods or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used to store the sperm after copulation. The cyphopod morphology can also be used to identify species. Millipede sperm lack flagella, a unique trait among myriapods.

In all except the bristle millipedes, copulation occurs with the two individuals facing one another. Copulation may be preceded by male behaviours such as tapping with antennae, running along the back of the female, offering edible glandular secretions, or in the case of some pill-millipedes, stridulation or &quot;chirping&quot;. During copulation in most millipedes, the male positions his seventh segment in front of the female&#x27;s third segment, and may insert his gonopods to extrude the vulvae before bending his body to deposit sperm onto his gonopods and reinserting the &quot;charged&quot; gonopods into the female.

Females lay from ten to three hundred eggs at a time, depending on species, fertilising them with the stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit the eggs on moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried faeces, and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs after they are laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.

The young hatch after a few weeks, and typically have only three pairs of legs, followed by up to four legless segments. As they grow, they continually moult, adding further segments and legs as they do so, a mode of development known as anamorphosis. Some species moult within specially prepared chambers of soil or silk, and may also shelter in these during wet weather, and most species eat the discarded exoskeleton after moulting. The adult stage, when individuals become reproductively mature, is generally reached in the final moult stage, which varies between species and orders, although some species continue to moult after adulthood. Furthermore, some species alternate between reproductive and non-reproductive stages after maturity, a phenomenon known as periodomorphosis, in which the reproductive structures regress during non-reproductive stages. Millipedes may live from one to ten years, depending on species.

==Ecology==

===Habitat and distribution===
Millipedes occur on all continents except Antarctica, and occupy almost all terrestrial habitats, ranging as far north as the Arctic Circle in Iceland, Norway, and Central Russia, and as far south as Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. Typically forest floor dwellers, they live in leaf litter, dead wood, or soil, with a preference for humid conditions. In temperate zones, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and may reach densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Deserticolous millipedes, species evolved to live in the desert, like &quot;Orthoporus ornatus&quot;, may show adaptations like a waxy epicuticle and the ability of water uptake from unsaturated air. Some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months. A few species occur near the seashore and can survive in somewhat salty conditions.

===Burrowing===
The diplosegments of millipedes have evolved in conjunction with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, wedging and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower their heads and barge their way into the substrate, the collum leading the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.
===Diet===
Most millipedes are detritivores and feed on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play important roles in the breakdown and decomposition of plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf litter, depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the leaf litter in a region. The leaf litter is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes play an important role in facilitating microbial decomposition of the leaf litter. Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are omnivorous or in Callipodida and Chordeumatida occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or snails. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices. Cave dwelling species in Julidae, Blaniulidae, and Polydesmidae have specialized mouthparts and appears to be filter feeders, filtering small particles from running water inside caves.

===Predators and parasites===

Millipedes are preyed on by a wide range of animals, including various reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, and insects. Mammalian predators such as coatis and meerkats roll captured millipedes on the ground to deplete and rub off their defensive secretions before consuming their prey, and certain poison dart frogs are believed to incorporate the toxic compounds of millipedes into their own defences. Several invertebrates have specialised behaviours or structures to feed on millipedes, including larval glowworm beetles, &quot;Probolomyrmex&quot; ants, chlamydephorid slugs, and predaceous dung beetles of the genera &quot;Sceliages&quot; and &quot;Deltochilum&quot;. A large subfamily of assassin bugs, the Ectrichodiinae with over 600 species, has specialised in preying upon millipedes. Parasites of millipedes include nematodes, phaeomyiid flies, and acanthocephalans. Nearly 30 fungal species of the order Laboulbeniales have been found growing externally on millipedes, but some species may be commensal rather than parasitic.

===Defence mechanisms===

Due to their lack of speed and their inability to bite or sting, millipedes&#x27; primary defence mechanism is to curl into a tight coil – protecting their delicate legs inside an armoured exoskeleton.

Many species also emit various foul-smelling liquid secretions through microscopic holes called ozopores (the openings of &quot;odoriferous&quot; or &quot;repugnatorial glands&quot;), along the sides of their bodies as a secondary defence. Among the many irritant and toxic chemicals found in these secretions are alkaloids, benzoquinones, phenols, terpenoids, and hydrogen cyanide. Some of these substances are caustic and can burn the exoskeleton of ants and other insect predators, and the skin and eyes of larger predators. Primates such as capuchin monkeys and lemurs have been observed intentionally irritating millipedes in order to rub the chemicals on themselves to repel mosquitoes. Some of these defensive compounds also show antifungal activity.

The bristly millipedes (order Polyxenida) lack both an armoured exoskeleton and odiferous glands, and instead are covered in numerous bristles that in at least one species, &quot;Polyxenus fasciculatus&quot;, detach and entangle ants.

===Other inter-species interactions===
Some millipedes form mutualistic relationships with organisms of other species, in which both species benefit from the interaction, or commensal relationships, in which only one species benefits while the other is unaffected. Several species form close relationships with ants, a relationship known as myrmecophily, especially within the family Pyrgodesmidae (Polydesmida), which contains &quot;obligate myrmecophiles&quot;, species which have only been found in ant colonies. More species are &quot;facultative myrmecophiles&quot;, non-exclusively associated with ants, including many species of Polyxenida that have been found in ant nests around the world.

Many millipede species have commensal relationships with mites of the orders Mesostigmata and Astigmata. Many of these mites are believed to be phoretic rather than parasitic, which means that they use the millipede host as a means of dispersal.

A novel interaction between millipedes and mosses was described in 2011, in which individuals of the newly discovered &quot;Psammodesmus bryophorus&quot; was found to have up to ten species living on its dorsal surface, in what may provide camouflage for the millipede and increased dispersal for the mosses.

==Interactions with humans==

Millipedes generally have little impact on human economic or social well-being, especially in comparison with insects, although locally they can be a nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.
Some millipedes are considered household pests, including &quot;Xenobolus carnifex&quot; which can infest thatched roofs in India, and &quot;Ommatoiulus moreleti&quot;, which periodically invades homes in Australia. Other species exhibit periodical swarming behaviour, which can result in home invasions, crop damage, and train delays when the tracks become slippery with the crushed remains of hundreds of millipedes. Some millipedes can cause significant damage to crops: the spotted snake millipede (&quot;Blaniulus guttulatus&quot;) is a pest of sugar beets and other root crops, and as a result is one of the few millipedes with a common name.

Some of the larger millipedes in the orders Spirobolida, Spirostreptida, and Sphaerotheriida are popular as pets. Some species commonly sold or kept include species of &quot;Archispirostreptus&quot;, &quot;Aphistogoniulus&quot;, &quot;Narceus&quot;, and &quot;Orthoporus&quot;.

Millipedes appear in folklore and traditional medicine around the world. Some cultures associate millipede activity with coming rains. In Zambia, smashed millipede pulp is used to treat wounds, and the Bafia people of Cameroon use millipede juice to treat earache. In certain Himalayan Bhotiya tribes, dry millipede smoke is used to treat haemorrhoids. Native people in Malaysia use millipede secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of &quot;Spirobolus bungii&quot; have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from the Bobo people of Burkina Faso in West Africa, who consume boiled, dried millipedes belonging to the families Gomphodesmidae and Spirostreptidae to which they add tomato sauce.

Millipedes have also inspired and played roles in scientific research. In 1963, a walking vehicle with 36 legs was designed, said to have been inspired by a study of millipede locomotion.
Experimental robots have had the same inspiration, in particular when heavy loads are needed to be carried in tight areas involving turns and curves. In biology, some authors have advocated millipedes as model organisms for the study of arthropod physiology and the developmental processes controlling the number and shape of body segments.

Similar to vermicompost, millipedes can be used to convert plant matter into compost in what has been named millicomposting, which improves the quality of the compost.

<text>Millipede (stylized millipede in western releases and Milli-Pede in Japan) is a fixed shooter video game released in arcades by Atari, Inc. in 1982. The sequel to 1981&#x27;s &quot;Centipede&quot;, it has more gameplay variety and a wider array of insects than the original. The objective is to score as many points as possible by destroying all segments of the millipede as it moves toward the bottom of the screen, as well as eliminating or avoiding other enemies. The game is played with a trackball and a single fire button which can be held down for rapid-fire.

&quot;Millipede&quot; was initially ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 8-bit computers, then later to the Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System.

== Gameplay ==
The player no longer takes the role of the &quot;Bug Blaster&quot; from &quot;Centipede&quot;, but instead takes the role of an elf called the &quot;Archer&quot;. The object of the game is to destroy a millipede that advances downward from the top of the screen. The millipede travels horizontally until it either hits an obstacle or reaches the edge of the screen, after which it drops one row and reverses direction. Once it enters the player&#x27;s gray maneuvering area, it stays there and extra heads appear at intervals until both they and the millipede are destroyed. Shooting a body segment splits the millipede in two, with the rear portion sprouting its own head. A collision with any enemy costs the player one life.

===Differences from &quot;Centipede&quot;===
* According to the game&#x27;s arcade flyer and instruction manual, the game&#x27;s storyline involves the player character, Archer, defending his mushroom forest from the onslaught of gigantic insect monsters using his magic arrows.
* The millipede moves faster and its head segment is more difficult to hit.
* Earwigs replace scorpions from &quot;Centipede&quot;, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.
* Bees replace fleas from &quot;Centipede&quot;, leaving mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to destroy.
* Spiders behave the same way as in &quot;Centipede&quot;, moving in zig-zag pattern across the player area and eating mushrooms. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.
* Inchworms move horizontally across the screen and slow all enemies for a short period of time when hit.
* Ladybugs crawl around the player area for a while, then climb up and leave the screen, turning any mushrooms they touch into indestructible flowers. When hit, all mushrooms on the screen scroll down one row.
* Dragonflies drop mushrooms while zig-zagging down.
* Mosquitoes bounce off the sides of the screen as they descend diagonally. When hit, all mushrooms on the screen scroll up one row.
* DDT bombs are triggered when shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the resulting cloud. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen, with up to four bombs in play at one time. Points are scored for shooting the bomb itself, and enemies destroyed in the blast are worth three times the normal points.

All flowers and poisoned or partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms and score points during the process when the player loses a life.

At regular intervals, the player enters a bonus level with a swarm of enemies (bees, dragonflies, etc.) instead of the usual millipede. Each enemy awards increasing points, up to a maximum of 1,000 points per enemy. The attack ends when either the entire swarm has passed or the player loses a life. Also, at intervals new mushrooms will grow on the field while others disappear, in a pattern similar to &quot;Conway&#x27;s Game of Life&quot;.

Players can choose whether to play at an advanced level, starting with a score that is a multiple of the number of points needed to earn an extra life (by default, 15,000). The gameplay is generally much more advanced than it would be had the player started with a score of 0 and worked their way up to that point level. The maximum advanced level allowed is a function of the preceding player&#x27;s score, and games started at an advanced level where the player did not earn at least one extra life are not eligible for the high scoreboard.

== Ports ==
&quot;Millipede&quot; was released for the Atari 2600 and Atari 8-bit computers in 1984, then the Atari ST in 1986. A version for the Family Computer was developed and published by HAL Laboratory as &quot;Milli-Pede: Kyodai Konchū no Gyakushū&quot;. It was renamed to &quot;Millipede: Super Arcade Hit!&quot; for its 1988 US Nintendo Entertainment System release. In the Family Computer and NES versions, earwigs do not poison the mushrooms.

A port of the Atari 8-bit version to the Atari 5200 was completed in 1984 but not published.

== Reception ==
It was listed by &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine as America&#x27;s fourth highest-grossing arcade game of 1983, below &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Pole Position&quot; and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;.

French magazine &quot;Tilt&quot; rated the arcade game with four out of six stars.

== Legacy ==
In 1995, &quot;Millipede&quot; was released together with &quot;Centipede&quot; on the Game Boy under the title &quot;Arcade Classic No. 2: Centipede / Millipede&quot;.

In 1997, it was included in &quot;Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2&quot; for the PlayStation.

In 2005, &quot;Millipede&quot; was combined with &quot;Super Breakout&quot; and &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; for the Game Boy Advance.

The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of the game were rereleased in the 2005 Atari Anthology for the Xbox and PlayStation 2. &quot;Millipede&quot; and &quot;Centipede&quot; were made available for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade in 2007.

==High scores==
Donald Hayes, of New Hampshire, USA, scored a world record 10,627,331 points playing &quot;Millipede&quot; on December 26, 2004. The highest &quot;Millipede&quot; score played under tournament settings is 495,126 points, also by Hayes.

In the default high-scores table of the arcade, the initials &quot;ED&quot; and &quot;FXL&quot; refer to &quot;Ed Logg&quot; (designing and programming) and &quot;Franz Lanzinger&quot; (who helped a bit in designing and testing).

The company&#x27;s roots date back to June 1, 1953, with the establishment of Televisora Independiente S.A, (TeleVisa), which operated the channel 4 in Caracas and channel 5 in Maracaibo. When TeleVisa went bankrupt in 1959 and 1960, Diego Cisneros purchased the remaining assets of the company. On February 27, 1961, Venevisión (a portmanteau based on the words &quot;Velvet de Venezuela&quot; and &quot;Televisión&quot;) was officially inaugurated with a special inaugural on March 1, 1961, show in which thousands of people attended, and took place in the station&#x27;s parking lot. Venevisión began with a capital of 5,500,000 bolívares and 150 employees including artists, administrators, and technical personnel. Venevisión&#x27;s original administrators were Diego Cisneros (president), Alfredo Torres (transmission manager), Héctor Beltrán (production manager), and Orlando Cuevas (general manager).

Initially, Venevisión broadcast live because they hadn&#x27;t yet installed the videotape system. Except for the news, the elaboration of their programs utilized the technical formats used in movies at that time. In a short period of time, Venevisión greatly expanded nationally, and was seen in most of Venezuela on many VHF and UHF channels.

In March 1961, the newly created Venevisión and the American television network, ABC, signed two agreements: one for technical support and the other for the rights to broadcast each other&#x27;s programs. Because of these agreements, Venevisión later began using the videotape system. In their first year of existence, Venevisión made approximately 800,000 bolívares a month in advertisements. By 1971, it began to bring its then black and white programs to viewers internationally via videotape, with the drama program &quot;Esmeralda&quot; as the first to do so. In the next year, the network officially took over the broadcasts of the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant, and it has been its home ever since.

In 1976, Venevisión moved their transmitters, which were located on the top of a building in La Colina, a neighborhood in Caracas where Venevisión&#x27;s studios can be found, to Los Mecedores, near Venezolana de Televisión&#x27;s studios and CANTV&#x27;s installations. In Los Mecedores, a tower with an altitude of 100 meters was placed and a powerful new antenna was installed. With this new antenna, Venevisión&#x27;s signal was able to reach Petare, Caricuao, and Guarenas with better quality. In the 1970s, like other television stations in Venezuela, Venevisión began experimenting with color broadcasts. In 1978, the Ministry of Transport and Communications fined Venevisión 4,000 bolívares on two occasions in one week for violating the regulations for color broadcasting. It was only the next year when color broadcasts commenced, with full color transmissions commencing on June 1, 1980.

The first programme by Venevision shown in color was the eight edition of the OTI Festival, which was held in Caracas and broadcast live to all Latin-America, Spain and Portugal.

In 1982, Venevisión began preliminary work in the city of El Tigre (located in the Anzoátegui State) to install equipment that would expand and improve their coverage in that region.

On November 1, 1986, Venevisión was the first television station in Venezuela to have their very own satellite dish.

On May 27, 1987, president Jaime Lusinchi gave a 20-year broadcasting licence to the network.

On February 4, 1992, Carlos Andrés Pérez addressed the nation from Venevisión&#x27;s studios during a coup attempt against his government.

Beginning on March 22, 1992, Venevisión would broadcast for 24 hours on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. In April 1994, it started broadcasting for 24 hours seven days a week. Today, Venevisión is on the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

In 1995, Venevisión was the first television station in South America to include news and movies with closed caption and the movies in Second audio program sound.

Venevisión held the broadcasting rights to Venezuelan baseball games during the 2004–2005 and the 2005–2006 baseball seasons.

Since Venevisión was inaugurated in 1961, their mascot has been a tiger.

In 2007, it started simulcasting Copa America and Miss Venezuela 2007 in high-definition format.

Since September 2014, Venevisión currently became the oldest television network in Venezuela and surpassed the record of its former rival Radio Caracas Televisión before its forced closure in May 2007, 53 years and 6 months after it was launched.

==International broadcasts==
Many of Venevisión&#x27;s programs can be seen in other countries on Ve Plus TV, Venevisión Plus and ViendoMovies, a cable channel completely owned by Venevisión. Other channels, such as Univision in the United States and Televisa in Mexico, broadcast some of Venevisión&#x27;s shows.

==Political position==
On April 11, 2002, the network along with most of the other private networks in Venezuela, simultaneously showed Chávez&#x27;s address to the nation in split screen with the shooting of people in a demonstration prior to the 2002 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt. The next day, Isaías Rodríguez announced in a news conference that Chávez had not resigned and that there had been a coup.

After the Presidential election in 2006, Venevision softened its opposition to Chávez. For the presidential election, Venevision devoted 84% of its coverage to Chavez&#x27;s positions, and 16% to the opposition. Critics saw the change, which created rifts in the Venezuelan elite, as a way of maintaining its broadcasting licence by avoiding a confrontation with Chávez. The criticism of Venevisión by the opposition increased during the refusal to renew the broadcasting license of RCTV by the Chávez government in 2007. Critics said Venevisión would benefit from the closure of RCTV, which was Venevisión&#x27;s main rival. Cisneros however, said he expected only around a 5% increase in advertising revenue, after accounting for inflation.

==Programming==
Venevisión&#x27;s programming include telenovelas, series, news, current affairs, documentaries, talk shows, variety shows, reality shows, sports and special events. It also include acquired programming from Televisa, Univision, Caracol Televisión and TV Globo. All of its programs are also available for streaming on Venevisión Play.

== Venevisión Play ==
Venevisión Play is a Venezuelan video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by Venevisión, that was launched on August 25, 2023. The service mainly distributes telenovelas produced by Venevisión and other programs including news, television series, documentaries, sports programming, talk shows, reality shows, Miss Venezuela and other special events.

<doc id="100347" wikidata="Q379977" url="?curid=100347" title="Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre">
<text>Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre (February 22, 1895 – August 2, 1979) was a Peruvian politician, philosopher, and author who founded the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) political movement, the oldest currently existing political party in Peru by the name of the &quot;Peruvian Aprista Party&quot; (PAP).

Born to an aristocratic family in Trujillo, a city on the north Peruvian coast, he enrolled in the National University of Trujillo and then the School of Law of the National University of San Marcos. He soon stood out as a student leader supporting the working class. He participated in protests against the regime of Augusto B. Leguía, standing out as a vigorous and eloquent speaker, with great power of persuasion due to the depth of his ideas. Banished by Leguía in 1922, he emigrated to Mexico, where in 1924 he founded the APRA, a political movement with continental projection and a social democratic orientation, initially with a clear anti-imperialist position.

Returning to Peru in 1930 after a European and Latin American tour, he founded the APRA, on whose political scene he would remain active from then until his death. He suffered imprisonment, exiles and political asylum. He ran for the presidency in the 1931 elections, losing to Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro. Imprisoned in 1932 by the Sánchez Cerro administration, he was released in 1933, only to be persecuted again, already under the government of Óscar R. Benavides. He remained in hiding until 1945, when his party returned to legality; he supported the National Democratic Front, which elevated José Luis Bustamante y Rivero to the presidency. In 1948, his party was again banned and after the coup d&#x27;état by general Manuel A. Odría he was forced to take refuge in the Colombian embassy (1948–1954). In 1956, he contributed to the electoral victory of Manuel Prado Ugarteche, initiating the so-called &quot;coexistence&quot;. Once again as presidential nominee, he placed first in the 1962 election, but the Armed Forces issued a veto against him, prompting a military coup that overthrew Prado and prevented his bidding to seal his victory in Congress in favor of Odría.

During the Armed Forces Revolutionary Government, he assembled and instructed a new generation of party leaders, which included his successor and future president of Peru, Alan García. He was overwhelmingly elected to the Constituent Assembly, being elected as the body&#x27;s president, and leading the drafting of a new Peruvian constitution, which he would sign in his deathbed in July 1979. He died on August 2, 1979, and his remains rest in his hometown of Trujillo. He remains one of the most influential political thinkers in Peruvian history. His legacy is considered fundamental in Peruvian historiography, with his ideology coined as revolutionary by historians.

==Early life and education==

Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre was born in the northern Peruvian city of Trujillo on February 22, 1895. He was the son of Raúl Edmundo Haya y de Cárdenas, also from Trujillo, and Zoila Victoria de la Torre y de Cárdenas, who were also cousins. His birth is commemorated as &quot;Fraternity Day&quot; every February 22 by the Peruvian Aprista Party.

Haya studied his primary and secondary education at the Seminary of San Carlos School and San Marcelo School of Trujillo. In 1913, he enrolled in the National University of Trujillo to study literature, where he met and forged a solid friendship with the Peruvian poet César Vallejo. Both, along with other students and under the leadership of Antenor Orrego and José Eulogio Garrido, integrated the so-called &quot;Trujillo bohemia&quot;, where he was known as &quot;The Prince of Misfortune&quot; among his classmates. This intellectual group was later baptized as the North Group.

Subsequently, he continued his undergraduate education at the National University of San Marcos in Lima, where he pursued a law degree. In 1917, he was introduced to politician and writer Manuel González Prada, whom is cited as his main influence in the capital, developing political concerns derived from the radicalism of said intellectual. In 1918, he was one of those who carried his coffin. Historians have debated over the fact that González Prada is the precursor of &quot;Aprismo&quot;.

===Student leader (1919–1923)===
In January 1919, he joined the college commission that supported the workers&#x27; struggle for the establishment of the eight-hour labor reform. Contrary to popular belief, Haya de la Torre did not assume a leading role in the development of the strike, but rather played a small role as a student leader. This episode marked the beginning of Haya&#x27;s active participation in Peruvian politics. In October of that same year, he was elected president of the Peruvian Student Federation. He was linked with all sectors of society. He led movements in favor of university reform in Peru and labor organizations. He participated in the first National Student Congress, held in Cusco (March 1920), where the project to create the &quot;popular universities&quot; was approved, which in 1922 took shape under the name of &quot;González Prada&quot;, night schools for workers, which according to some historians formed the foundation for his party. He was instrumental in bringing the ideas of the Argentine University Reform movement (La Reforma) to San Marcos, and administrative reforms were instituted in 1919. Part of the reform movement was university extension programs, through which the university students hoped to reach the working classes.

He launched numerous protests against the government of Augusto B. Leguía when, around 1923, began to plot his perpetuation in power (this regime would later be known as &quot;the Eleven-Year Rule&quot;). One of the most significant of these protests was the opposition campaign to the projected official consecration of the country to the Sacred Heart order, promoted by the Archbishop of Lima, Emilio Lisson, to legitimize the dictatorial regime. During the street protest, a student and a worker died (May 23, 1923), which became a symbol of student-worker unity. The consecration ceremony was finally suspended by the archbishop. Later, Haya led the radical student-worker magazine Claridad, in collaboration with José Carlos Mariátegui, as &quot;organ of the free youth of Peru&quot; and of the popular universities.

Haya also taught at the Colegio Anglo-Peruano (now Colegio San Andres), a school operated by the Free Church of Scotland in Lima. He was deeply influenced by the headmaster of the school, John A. Mackay, a Free Church missionary. In October 1923, he was arrested and detained in the El Frontón prison, where he went on a hunger strike; six days after the strike, he was shipped in the small steam train Negada and deported to Panama.

==Exile; Foundation of the APRA==

In Panama, Haya stayed for two weeks, before heading to Cuba. From there he went to Mexico, invited by José Vasconcelos, then Secretary of Public Education, to collaborate as his secretary. He arrived in Mexico City on November 16, 1923. He then made contact with the Mexican Revolution, appreciating the socio-economic changes that took place in that country.

He contacted Mexican students to encourage them to develop a continental student and labor fraternity. It was precisely in Mexico City that, on May 7, 1924, he founded the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance. As it can be deduced from its name, Haya de la Torre&#x27;s initial political option sought to consolidate itself into a project for Latin America, as a pan-Latin American movement.

In a simple ceremony, he presented the students of Mexico with the flag of Indoamerica, on which occasion he said: «This flag that I give you will first fly over the dreamy crowds of the youth that are opening the way, and later they will be the people who shake it in the shuddering tumult of their struggles ». Its doctrinal foundations were presented two years later, in the manifesto entitled &quot;What is the APRA?&quot;. Initially published in English in the Labour Monthly magazine in London, in December 1926, and later translated into Spanish and reproduced in various Latin American publications. In this document, it exposes the five basic points of the Aprista doctrine:
In September 1924 he traveled to Russia, where he made contact with the Russian Revolution, which served as a source of inspiration for his ideology. He also traveled through Switzerland, Italy and France. In 1925, he settled in England, where, between 1926 and 1927, he studied economics at the London School of Economics and then anthropology at the University of Oxford, where he would later become a professor (in 1964).

Haya devoted himself entirely to forming a great movement that could represent the excluded masses of &quot;Indoamerica&quot;. The APRA had its first committee in Paris (founded on January 22, 1927), followed in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and La Paz. The APRA was born as an eminently anti-oligarchic and anti-imperialist force. It was early linked to Marxism but clearly disagreed with communism, as it considered it a totalitarian political system. In 1927, he published his first book, entitled &quot;For the Emancipation of Latin America&quot;, where he exposed the Aprista doctrine. In May 1928, he finished writing his book &quot;The anti-imperialism and APRA&quot;, a work that for economic reasons would not come to light until 1935.

In February 1927, he participated in the First Anti-imperialist Congress in Brussels, in which he raised the difference between APRA and communism. In November of that year he left Europe and returned to America, passing through New York City before returning to Mexico. He then undertook a tour of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and, again, Panama, being prevented from landing in the Canal Zone and, rather, was exiled again to Europe on December 16, 1928. He spent some time in Berlin and in other cities until June 1931. In the meantime, the government of Leguía was overthrown by the Peruvian Army led by Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro on August 25, 1930. Haya returned to Peru and founded the Peruvian Aprista Party (PAP) on September 20, 1930.

==1931 presidential election==

After having lived in exile as a consequence of his fight against the Leguía administration, Haya de la Torre returned to Peru, having been nominated as presidential candidate for the 1931 general election with the newly founded Peruvian Aprista Party. He first arrived in Talara (July 12, 1931), and was received in his hometown (July 25), and finally entered Lima (August 15), where before a huge crowd gathered in Plaza de Acho, he exposed the party&#x27;s program, in which he emphasized state intervention in the economy (August 23). The APRA campaign introduced means never before seen in the elections in Peru: street graffiti in all the cities of the country; candidates called by name – &quot;Víctor Raúl&quot;, &quot;Luis Alberto&quot;, etc.—; inclusion of non-voters —JAP (Aprista Youth), CHAP (Aprista Boys) -; own hymn, which superimposed the lyrics to the music of the French Marseillaise – the Aprista Marseillaise; a flag for the party identifying the supporters; supporters called &quot;companions&quot; holding up white scarves, and the famous &quot;SEASAP&quot; (&quot;Only APRA will save Peru&quot;). A kind of cult figure of Haya began in the party, who was at the same time &quot;Victor Raúl&quot;, &quot;the boss&quot;, &quot;the guide&quot; and &quot;the master&quot;.

According to the Electoral Jury that directed this election, Haya placed second with 35% of the popular vote, behind Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro (Revolutionary Union); however, Haya and the APRA as a whole never recognized the official results or the new government.

==Presidency of Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro and the Great Clandestinity (1931–1945)==

The Sánchez Cerro government was authoritarian and repressive. Haya de la Torre was subsequently arrested, and the APRA congressional representation was ousted in January 1932, prompting popular protests across the country. In the city of Trujillo, a failed APRA armed uprising took place that led to clashes between the APRA members and the Armed Forces of Peru. The insurrection was harshly repressed, hundreds of Apristas were detained, and over 6000 were executed in front of the Peruvian ruins of Chan Chan (on the outskirts of Trujillo). The so-called &quot;Trujillo Revolution&quot;, as the Apristas know it, was parallel to other revolutionary movements in various parts of the country (such as Huaraz and Huari).

In spite of the revolution, the Peruvian Congress amended the Constitution, banning all &quot;international&quot; parties. Based on this, and invoking that the nation was in danger, the government declared the Peruvian Aprista Party illegal in 1932. However, president Sánchez Cerro was assassinated with several shots at point-blank range on April 30, 1933, in the Campo de Marte of Lima. The perpetrator of the assassination was an APRA member identified as Alejandro Mendoza Leyva, who was killed on the spot, although the APRA leadership could not be syndicated as the intellectual author of the crime, due to lack of evidence.

After the death of Sánchez Cerro, former president and general Óscar R. Benavides took office, who expressed hope in &quot;peace and harmony&quot; for Peru. Haya was released from prison on August 10, 1933, as other Aprista prisoners were also released from jails and many others returned from exile. But this release would not last long. Following the Aprista conspiracy of El Agustino, in November 1934, the government resumed its anti-Aprista persecution. Thus began, for Haya and his supporters, the stage of &quot;the great clandestinity&quot;, which would only conclude, officially, in 1945 (to increase again between 1948 and 1956, under Manuel A. Odría administration).

In the 1936 presidential elections, the Peruvian Aprista Party supported Luis Antonio Eguiguren, who attained the highest number of votes; however, Congress invalidated the election on the grounds that the votes in favor of Eguiguren came from members of an outlawed party, an unheard-of argument, even more so considering that suffrage was secret.

==Presidency of José Luis Bustamante y Rivero (1945–1948)==
In 1945, the Peruvian Aprista Party returned to legality by participating in the coalition of the National Democratic Front (FDN). Haya de la Torre agreed to launch jurist José Luis Bustamante y Rivero as the presidential nominee for FDN. On May 20, 1945, Haya reappeared in public, after ten years in hiding, on the occasion in which he delivered his &quot;Reencounter Speech&quot;, before a massive concentration of his supporters in Plaza San Martín.

Bustamante y Rivero was ultimately elected president. Thanks to their electoral victory, Haya and the party controlled the legislative caucus as a whole. From there, they managed to approve various measures in favor of the Peruvian people, in addition to demanding greater speed for the reforms that Bustamante was trying to stop. They made vigorous pressure to achieve their objectives, provoking the reaction of the conservative elite, which originated a stage of misrule and anarchy that put the regime in check. In view of this, the opposition caucus failed to attend Congress, causing its recess. Uprisings occurred throughout the country, including the Aprista carried out in the port of Callao. Bustamante was forced to govern by decree, and banned the party for a second time while the oligarchy knocked on the door of the military barracks. Finally, all this led to the coup propelled by Manuel A. Odría, former Minister of Government and Police. Subsequently, Haya went into hiding, along with other party leaders.

==Political asylum case and &quot;Thirty Years of Aprismo&quot; (1948–1954)==
Haya de la Torre was persecuted and Bustamante deported. Haya took refuge in the Colombian embassy in Lima where he requested political asylum for sixty-three months since the Odría administration refused to grant the safe-conduct to leave the country, a situation that became an important reference case in international law.

In 1954, Haya was authorized to leave Peru thanks to international pressure – he was friends with various figures, such as Albert Einstein - and published an article in Life magazine where he began to outline the &quot;democratic anti-imperialism without empire&quot;. According to some historians, Haya abandoned his original ideology and made a conservative turn with &quot;Thirty Years of Aprismo&quot;, a reflective work where Haya analyzed the APRA&#x27;s position and amended its program.

==The Coexistence (1956–1962)==
In 1956, the three main presidential candidates assured the return to legality of the APRA party; by virtue of this offer, Haya de la Torre initially supported businessman Hernando de Lavalle, and later Manuel Prado Ugarteche, a symbol of economic power, who, thanks to this support, was successful. Peru would oversee a mega-coalition that buttressed the second Pradista government: president Manuel Prado y Ugarteche himself, Haya de la Torre, Manuel A. Odría, Pedro Beltrán, Eudocio Ravines and Julio de la Piedra. It was, therefore, &quot;a regime to which the Peruvian Aprista Party has supported with proven loyalty and determination.&quot;

Haya and his party —in its early days clearly anti-oligarchic— thus sustained a clearly oligarchic regime, probably with the hope of coming to power by legal means and already exercising them, to make the appropriate reforms. Years later, consulted by Julio Cotler on the matter, Haya replied that &quot;he had misjudged the situation and thought that the oligarchy had more strength than it really had.&quot;

==Final presidential bids and First Presidency of Fernando Belaúnde==
===1962 presidential election===
In the 1962 general elections, Haya returned to Peru to launch his second presidential bid with the Peruvian Aprista Party nomination under &quot;Democratic Alliance&quot;, which grouped his party with the Pradista Democratic Movement – which represented the largest sectors of power economic-. Haya obtained 33% of the popular vote, compared to the 32% for newcomer Fernando Belaúnde of the reformist Popular Action and 29% for former president Manuel A. Odría of the Odriist National Union.

As he did not obtain the necessary percentage to be proclaimed president, the election was to be decided by Congress to be installed on July 28, as established by the 1933 Constitution. Apparently, the Peruvian Armed Forces feared that Haya would come to power and they went to the Palace to report their disappointment; informed of this by president Prado, Haya would have tried to make an alliance with Fernando Belaúnde but they reached a standstill, with which he could only consolidate one with Manuel A. Odría, for which he would yield the Aprista votes to him. The Armed Forces denounced fraud in ten departments and also spoke against the virtual president Odría (and not against Haya, according to the position of the historian Percy Cayo Córdoba). Finally, on July 18, the first institutional coup of the Armed Forces took place, led by General Ricardo Pérez Godoy, who overthrew the government of Manuel Prado Ugarteche, thus declaring the elections void and installed a military junta. The coup would also be backed by Popular Action.

===1963 presidential election===
In 1963, the Military Junta led by Nicolás Lindley López convened new elections for June of that year. The three main presidential nominees from the void 1962 election took over the polls once again. Haya was nominated for a third time to presidency with the Peruvian Aprista Party, while Fernando Belaúnde ran in coalition with Popular Action and the Christian Democrat Party, the latter led by Héctor Cornejo Chávez.

The exit polls gave a sound victory for Fernando Belaúnde with 36% of the popular vote, while Haya attained 33%, placing second. The outcome would propel the alliance between Haya and Manuel A. Odría in Congress with the Peruvian Aprista Party and the Odriist National Union.

===APRA-UNO Coalition (1963–1968)===
During the years of the Belaúnde administration, Haya and his party remained in opposition alongside Manuel Odría, forming the APRA-UNO coalition, which by number controlled both houses of Congress and strongly opposed Popular Action. They opposed the measures proposed by the government, causing the first agrarian reform law to have a minimum scope: Congress declared the &#x27;efficient&#x27; farms dedicated to export crops unaffected, decided that the damages in the backward areas were supervised by a legislative office, and systematically cut the resources destined to the government bonds of payment for the expropriations; the first Agrarian Reform only expropriated 3% of the expropriable land, and benefited only 13,500 families. Likewise, the coalition censored six cabinets ministers of the Fernando Belaúnde administration, including the entire cabinet presided by Julio Óscar Trelles Montes.

==Later life and Constituent Assembly==
===Armed Forces Revolutionary Government===
After the establishment of the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado, the political parties – the Peruvian Aprista Party among them – were banned and their popular bases persecuted. However, in 1970, on Fraternity Day, Haya claimed the intellectual paternity of the reforms carried out by the military, protesting that they did not recognize the intellectual debt they owed him: &quot;We must be dissatisfied because it is not the way, quickly and furtively, to carry these ideas forward and to hide them, especially hiding their origin and provenance &quot;.

During this time, Haya established the National Bureau of Conjunctions, a party organ tasked with recruiting the most talented youth of the Peruvian Aprista Party. From this group, future president Alan García would rise as its main representative, alongside Carlos Roca Cáceres and Víctor Polay (the latter defecting from the party and forming the terrorist organization known as the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement in 1982).

===Constituent Assembly (1978–1979)===
Haya led the popular pressure exerted against the Francisco Morales-Bermúdez administration for the military to return to their barracks and restore democracy. A Constituent Assembly was ultimately convened on July 28, 1978, after elections on June 18, 1978. The Aprista Party attained 37 seats, including Haya, who was elected with over one million votes nationally. Due for having the highest vote count, he was unanimously elected to preside over the Constituent Assembly on July 28, 1978. In a symbolic act, his salary as president of the Assembly was 1 sol de oro. The same day of the installation of the assembly, Haya marked his clear independence with respect to the military regime:

The drafting of the new constitution took about a year to complete. Haya was absent in the last months of the Assembly due to his failing health. First Vice President of the Assembly, Luis Alberto Sánchez, took over the presidency pro tempore of the Assembly in Haya&#x27;s absence. During this period, he was considered a strong contender in the 1980 general election for the presidency.

==Death==

On July 12, 1979, Haya signed the Constitution on his deathbed. Suffering from lung cancer, Haya died on August 2, 1979, in Mercedes Villa, his home located in the Ate District. On his deathbed he was awarded the Order of the Sun of Peru, in the rank of Grand Cross. At the moment of his death, several party leaders were present, including Luis Alberto Sánchez, Ramiro Prialé, Andrés Townsend, Javier Valle Riestra, Armando Villanueva, Carlos Roca Cáceres and Alan García. Then-president of the United States, Jimmy Carter, sent a letter expressing his condolences to Haya&#x27;s brother, Edmundo.

His casket was taken to the party headquarters and received by a huge crowd of supporters and followers, who accompanied the transfer of his remains from Lima to his hometown in Trujillo. He was buried in the Miraflores General Cemetery in downtown Trujillo. His coffin rests under a large rock with the phrase &quot;Here lies the light.&quot;

The last years of Haya de la Torre&#x27;s life were spent in her home in Chaclacayo de Villa Mercedes, which became a house of worship for many Peruvians. Later it became known that the house was bought by a drug trafficker, Carlos Langberg, who had financed the Aprista electoral campaign of 1980.

==Legacy==
Haya de la Torre corresponds to one of the most particular, evolutionary and complex ideological processes in the history of Peru. The set of his writings, pronouncements and positions make him a heterogeneous and even contradictory character, his message has lent itself to different and diverse interpretations. According to general Aprista concepts, Haya applied historical materialism to the revision of the history and objective conditions of Latin America, deducing from it an original theory of political action to lead these societies towards socialism; on the theoretical level, his thought, although close to Marxism at first, will turn out to be different and still contrary to Leninism regarding socialist strategy in colonial or peripheral societies.

Haya postulates that imperialism is the highest expression of capitalism, which is, in turn, the mode of economic production superior to everything the world knew. By virtue of which, he concludes that capitalism is an inevitable phase in the process of contemporary civilization. Capitalism, according to Haya, will not be eternal and has contradictions within itself that will finally end it, but for that to happen, it must evolve completely, that is, exist and mature. He emphasized that the proletariat of the less-developed Latin American countries is too young to make the great revolution that surpasses capitalism.

He goes on to indicate that imperialism is the last phase of capitalism in developed countries, but in underdeveloped countries, such as Peru, it is the first phase. In these countries, it is not a stage of advanced industrialization but rather of exploitation of raw materials, because it is the type of production that the developed world from which the imperialist capitals come from is interested in doing there; not the citizens of these countries. For this reason, he says, its initial development is slow and incomplete. In this way, America&#x27;s problem is political: how to emancipate yourself from the yoke of imperialism without delaying its progress. As long as it is America and not Europe, as long as it came to capitalism through imperialism, it has to adopt an aptitude for dealing with the problem that is its own.

Haya estimates that it will be the three classes oppressed by imperialism that will advance this stage of society: the young industrial proletariat, the peasantry and the impoverished middle classes. With the alliance of these classes in power, the State will no longer be an instrument of imperialism but a defender of the classes it represents. Thus, they will take from the developed countries what interests them and negotiate with them as equals, not subject, because they need each other. Based on this stance, Haya advocated a system of Latin American (or, to use his preferred term, &quot;Indo-American)&quot; solutions to Latin American problems. He called upon the region to reject both U.S. imperialism and Soviet communism.
With an Americanist vision of doing politics, he believed in what he called &quot;Indoamerica&quot; had to be integrated and fight together to advance. That is why his party has a name that includes the concept of an American alliance. In short, he says that the anti-imperialist resistance in America must be created and given a form of a political organization. This is what Haya considers APRA to be.

Currently, the reinterpretations and analysis of &quot;Hayism&quot; from inside and outside the Peruvian Aprista Party are increasing. Obviously, the most outstanding recent work on the matter corresponds to the authorship of Haya&#x27;s successor and former president, Alan García. García published &quot;The Constructive Revolution of Aprismo: Theory and Practice of Modernity&quot; (Lima, 2008); the work outlines an ideological history of the APRA with a view to explaining the current perspective of Aprismo of his time and its governmental expression. The work aims to show a concurrent Haya with a process of intellectual and political maturation; he further explains that during the period 1970–1990, the Apra &quot;turned out to be more ideologically propelled by Juan Velasco Alvarado&#x27;s legacy than Hayista.&quot; García says that his party made a mistake in interpreting the military revolution as the &quot;accomplishment of what the APRA had proposed since 1931. &quot;which would have led them to&quot; adopt as their own nationalizations, the collectivist model in agriculture and the state management of trade in many services and goods &quot;, which were concepts&quot; totally alien to the ideology of Haya and his work dialectically&quot;. García&#x27;s thesis has been contested, or at least disputed, by various Peruvian historians, such as Hugo Neira, Sinesio López, Nelson Manrique and Martín Tanaka.

==Personal life==
The lack of love interests in Haya de la Torre&#x27;s life was sometimes remarked upon. Haya de la Torre once stated to APRA members: &quot;El APRA es mi mujer y ustedes son mis hijos&quot; (&quot;The Apra is my wife and you [the members] are my children&quot;). However, rumours of homosexuality were scattered around the country during and after his life by his political enemies, generally in a crudely homophobic fashion.

Haya de la Torre clearly liked the company of young men. André Coyne, a well-respected French literary critic who happened to be both a good friend of Haya&#x27;s and the loyal lover and supporter of the Peruvian expatriate poet César Moro, states that Haya sometimes went to &quot;bares de muchachos&quot; (literally &quot;young men&#x27;s bars&quot;) with him, but that he doesn&#x27;t know whether Haya &quot;ejercía&quot; (i.e., practiced homosexuality). Some personal letters from a close European male friend have also been interpreted as indicating a romantic partnership. In the end, Haya has never been found to have had any sexual partners of either gender. His supporters have sometimes claimed he had female lovers.

There have been claims that Haya de la Torre secretly married his close friend and sympathizer Ana Billinghurst (daughter of former president Guillermo Billinghurst) in 1923, but they seem to have been shown to be unfounded. In the 1950s the APRA leader was forced into asylum by General Odria at the Colombian Embassy in Lima. Ana Billinghurst died while he was under diplomatic protection and he was unable to attend her funeral.

<text>In mathematics, Legendre polynomials, named after Adrien-Marie Legendre (1782), are a system of complete and orthogonal polynomials with a wide number of mathematical properties and numerous applications. They can be defined in many ways, and the various definitions highlight different aspects as well as suggest generalizations and connections to different mathematical structures and physical and numerical applications.

Closely related to the Legendre polynomials are associated Legendre polynomials, Legendre functions, Legendre functions of the second kind, big q-Legendre polynomials, and associated Legendre functions.

== Definition and representation ==

=== Definition by construction as an orthogonal system ===
In this approach, the polynomials are defined as an orthogonal system with respect to the weight function formula_1 over the interval formula_2. That is, formula_3 is a polynomial of degree formula_4, such that
formula_5

With the additional standardization condition formula_6, all the polynomials can be uniquely determined. We then start the construction process: formula_7 is the only correctly standardized polynomial of degree 0. formula_8 must be orthogonal to formula_9, leading to formula_10, and formula_11 is determined by demanding orthogonality to formula_9 and formula_13, and so on. formula_14 is fixed by demanding orthogonality to all formula_15 with formula_16. This gives formula_17 conditions, which, along with the standardization formula_18 fixes all formula_19 coefficients in formula_20. With work, all the coefficients of every polynomial can be systematically determined, leading to the explicit representation in powers of formula_21 given below.

This definition of the formula_14&#x27;s is the simplest one. It does not appeal to the theory of differential equations. Second, the completeness of the polynomials follows immediately from the completeness of the powers 1, formula_23. Finally, by defining them via orthogonality with respect to the Lebesgue measure on formula_24, it sets up the Legendre polynomials as one of the three classical orthogonal polynomial systems. The other two are the Laguerre polynomials, which are orthogonal over the half line formula_25 with the weight formula_26, and the Hermite polynomials, orthogonal over the full line formula_27 with weight formula_28.

=== Definition via generating function ===
The Legendre polynomials can also be defined as the coefficients in a formal expansion in powers of formula_29 of the generating function
 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty P_n(x) t^n \.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

The coefficient of formula_30 is a polynomial in formula_31 of degree formula_4 with formula_33. Expanding up to formula_34 gives
formula_35
Expansion to higher orders gets increasingly cumbersome, but is possible to do systematically, and again leads to one of the explicit forms given below.

It is possible to obtain the higher formula_14&#x27;s without resorting to direct expansion of the Taylor series, however. Equation  is differentiated with respect to on both sides and rearranged to obtain
formula_37
Replacing the quotient of the square root with its definition in Eq. , and equating the coefficients of powers of in the resulting expansion gives &quot;Bonnet’s recursion formula&quot;
formula_38
This relation, along with the first two polynomials and , allows all the rest to be generated recursively.

The generating function approach is directly connected to the multipole expansion in electrostatics, as explained below, and is how the polynomials were first defined by Legendre in 1782.

=== Definition via differential equation ===
A third definition is in terms of solutions to Legendre&#x27;s differential equation:
This differential equation has regular singular points at so if a solution is sought using the standard Frobenius or power series method, a series about the origin will only converge for in general. When is an integer, the solution that is regular at is also regular at , and the series for this solution terminates (i.e. it is a polynomial). The orthogonality and completeness of these solutions is best seen from the viewpoint of Sturm–Liouville theory. We rewrite the differential equation as an eigenvalue problem,
formula_39
with the eigenvalue formula_40 in lieu of formula_41. If we demand that the solution be regular at
formula_42, the differential operator on the left is Hermitian. The eigenvalues are found to be of the form
, with formula_43 and the eigenfunctions are the formula_3. The orthogonality and completeness of this set of solutions follows at once from the larger framework of Sturm–Liouville theory.

The differential equation admits another, non-polynomial solution, the Legendre functions of the second kind formula_45.
A two-parameter generalization of (Eq. ) is called Legendre&#x27;s &quot;general&quot; differential equation, solved by the Associated Legendre polynomials. Legendre functions are solutions of Legendre&#x27;s differential equation (generalized or not) with &quot;non-integer&quot; parameters.

In physical settings, Legendre&#x27;s differential equation arises naturally whenever one solves Laplace&#x27;s equation (and related partial differential equations) by separation of variables in spherical coordinates. From this standpoint, the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the Laplacian operator are the spherical harmonics, of which the Legendre polynomials are (up to a multiplicative constant) the subset that is left invariant by rotations about the polar axis. The polynomials appear as formula_46 where formula_47 is the polar angle. This approach to the Legendre polynomials provides a deep connection to rotational symmetry. Many of their properties which are found laboriously through the methods of analysis — for example the addition theorem — are more easily found using the methods of symmetry and group theory, and acquire profound physical and geometrical meaning.

=== Rodrigues&#x27; formula and other explicit formulas ===
An especially compact expression for the Legendre polynomials is given by Rodrigues&#x27; formula:
formula_48

This formula enables derivation of a large number of properties of the formula_14&#x27;s. Among these are explicit representations such as
formula_50

Expressing the polynomial as a power series, formula_51, the coefficients of powers of formula_21 can also be calculated using a general formula:formula_53The Legendre polynomial is determined by the values used for the two constants formula_54 and formula_55, where formula_56 if formula_4 is odd and formula_58 if formula_4 is even.

In the fourth representation, formula_60 stands for the largest integer less than or equal to formula_61. The last representation, which is also immediate from the recursion formula, expresses the Legendre polynomials by simple monomials and involves the generalized form of the binomial coefficient.

The first few Legendre polynomials are:
The graphs of these polynomials (up to ) are shown below:
== Main properties ==

=== Orthogonality ===

The standardization formula_6 fixes the normalization of the Legendre polynomials (with respect to the norm on the interval ). Since they are also orthogonal with respect to the same norm, the two statements can be combined into the single equation,
formula_63
(where denotes the Kronecker delta, equal to 1 if and to 0 otherwise).
This normalization is most readily found by employing Rodrigues&#x27; formula, given below.

=== Completeness ===

That the polynomials are complete means the following. Given any piecewise continuous function formula_64 with finitely many discontinuities in the interval , the sequence of sums
formula_65
converges in the mean to formula_64 as formula_67, provided we take
formula_68

This completeness property underlies all the expansions discussed in this article, and is often stated in the form
formula_69
with and .

==Applications==

===Expanding an inverse distance potential===
The Legendre polynomials were first introduced in 1782 by Adrien-Marie Legendre as the coefficients in the expansion of the Newtonian potential
formula_70
where and are the lengths of the vectors and respectively and is the angle between those two vectors. The series converges when . The expression gives the gravitational potential associated to a point mass or the Coulomb potential associated to a point charge. The expansion using Legendre polynomials might be useful, for instance, when integrating this expression over a continuous mass or charge distribution.

Legendre polynomials occur in the solution of Laplace&#x27;s equation of the static potential, , in a charge-free region of space, using the method of separation of variables, where the boundary conditions have axial symmetry (no dependence on an azimuthal angle). Where is the axis of symmetry and is the angle between the position of the observer and the axis (the zenith angle), the solution for the potential will be
formula_71

 and are to be determined according to the boundary condition of each problem.

They also appear when solving the Schrödinger equation in three dimensions for a central force.

=== In multipole expansions ===

Legendre polynomials are also useful in expanding functions of the form (this is the same as before, written a little differently):
formula_72
which arise naturally in multipole expansions. The left-hand side of the equation is the generating function for the Legendre polynomials.

As an example, the electric potential (in spherical coordinates) due to a point charge located on the -axis at (see diagram right) varies as
formula_73

If the radius of the observation point is greater than , the potential may be expanded in the Legendre polynomials
formula_74
where we have defined and . This expansion is used to develop the normal multipole expansion.

Conversely, if the radius of the observation point is smaller than , the potential may still be expanded in the Legendre polynomials as above, but with and exchanged. This expansion is the basis of interior multipole expansion.

=== In trigonometry ===

The trigonometric functions , also denoted as the Chebyshev polynomials , can also be multipole expanded by the Legendre polynomials . The first several orders are as follows:
formula_75

Another property is the expression for , which is
formula_76

=== In recurrent neural networks ===

A recurrent neural network that contains a -dimensional memory vector, formula_77, can be optimized such that its neural activities obey the linear time-invariant system given by the following state-space representation:
formula_78
formula_79

In this case, the sliding window of formula_80 across the past formula_47 units of time is best approximated by a linear combination of the first formula_82 shifted Legendre polynomials, weighted together by the elements of formula_83 at time formula_29:
formula_85

When combined with deep learning methods, these networks can be trained to outperform long short-term memory units and related architectures, while using fewer computational resources.

== Additional properties ==
Legendre polynomials have definite parity. That is, they are even or odd, according to
formula_86

Another useful property is
formula_87
which follows from considering the orthogonality relation with formula_7. It is convenient when a Legendre series formula_89 is used to approximate a function or experimental data: the &quot;average&quot; of the series over the interval is simply given by the leading expansion coefficient formula_90.

Since the differential equation and the orthogonality property are independent of scaling, the Legendre polynomials&#x27; definitions are &quot;standardized&quot; (sometimes called &quot;normalization&quot;, but the actual norm is not 1) by being scaled so that
formula_91

The derivative at the end point is given by
formula_92

The Askey–Gasper inequality for Legendre polynomials reads
formula_93

The Legendre polynomials of a scalar product of unit vectors can be expanded with spherical harmonics using
formula_94
where the unit vectors and have spherical coordinates and , respectively.

The product of two Legendre polynomials 
formula_95
where formula_96 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.

===Recurrence relations===
As discussed above, the Legendre polynomials obey the three-term recurrence relation known as Bonnet&#x27;s recursion formula given by
formula_97
and
formula_98
or, with the alternative expression, which also holds at the endpoints
formula_99

Useful for the integration of Legendre polynomials is
formula_100

From the above one can see also that
formula_101
or equivalently
formula_102
where is the norm over the interval 
formula_103

===Asymptotics===

Asymptotically, for formula_104, the Legendre polynomials can be written as 
formula_105
and for arguments of magnitude greater than 1
formula_106
where , , and are Bessel functions.

=== Zeros ===
All formula_107 zeros of formula_3 are real, distinct from each other, and lie in the interval formula_109. Furthermore, if we regard them as dividing the interval formula_110 into formula_111 subintervals, each subinterval will contain exactly one zero of formula_112. This is known as the interlacing property. Because of the parity property it is evident that if formula_113 is a zero of formula_3, so is formula_115. These zeros play an important role in numerical integration based on Gaussian quadrature. The specific quadrature based on the formula_14&#x27;s is known as Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

From this property and the facts that formula_117, it follows that formula_118 has formula_119 local minima and maxima in formula_120. Equivalently, formula_121 has formula_122 zeros in formula_120.

===Pointwise evaluations===
The parity and normalization implicate the values at the boundaries formula_124 to be
formula_125
At the origin formula_126 one can show that the values are given by
formula_127formula_128

== Variants with transformed argument ==

=== Shifted Legendre polynomials ===

The shifted Legendre polynomials are defined as
formula_129
Here the &quot;shifting&quot; function is an affine transformation that bijectively maps the interval to the interval , implying that the polynomials are orthogonal on :
formula_130

An explicit expression for the shifted Legendre polynomials is given by
formula_131

The analogue of Rodrigues&#x27; formula for the shifted Legendre polynomials is
formula_132

The first few shifted Legendre polynomials are:
=== Legendre rational functions ===
The Legendre rational functions are a sequence of orthogonal functions on [0, ∞). They are obtained by composing the Cayley transform with Legendre polynomials.

A rational Legendre function of degree &quot;n&quot; is defined as:
formula_133

They are eigenfunctions of the singular Sturm–Liouville problem:
formula_134
with eigenvalues formula_135

<doc id="100350" wikidata="Q1463801" url="?curid=100350" title="The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle">
<text>The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle is the second studio album by the American rock singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen. It was recorded by Springsteen with the E Street Band at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, New York, and released on November 5, 1973, by Columbia Records. It includes the song &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot;, the band&#x27;s most-used set-closing song through 1985.

As with Springsteen&#x27;s debut album released earlier in the year, &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot;, &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot; was well-received critically but had little commercial success at the time. Locally, though, the album sold well, was played regularly on Northeast album-oriented rock stations and made Springsteen a local phenomenon. Once Springsteen achieved nationwide popularity with his subsequent album &quot;Born to Run&quot; (1975), several selections from this album became popular FM radio airplay and concert favorites. On November 7, 2009, Springsteen and the E Street Band played the album in its entirety for the first time during a concert at Madison Square Garden. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2020 edition of its &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list, the album was ranked at number 345.

==Recording==
Recording began on May 14, 1973, with the day spent on &quot;Circus Song&quot;, which would be finished on June 28, and re-titled &quot;Wild Billy&#x27;s Circus Story&quot;. Two days later, &quot;The Fever&quot; was recorded in one take, then discarded and not included on the album. Sessions did not resume until June 22, but all backing tracks and most of the album would be recorded by the end of the week. September 23, 1973 was the final day of sessions, with final touches applied to &quot;Kitty&#x27;s Back&quot;, the last verse of &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; overdubbed with new lyrics, &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot; and a brand new song, &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot;, both recorded from scratch and completed. Along with these tracks, the album would be composed of &quot;New York City Serenade&quot;, completed August 7, and &quot;The E Street Shuffle&quot;, recorded on June 28 in one session.

==Musical style==
According to biographer Peter Ames Carlin, Springsteen had developed a &quot;renewed passion for full-band rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; with &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;. Sputnikmusic critic Adam Thomas later wrote that the album departed from the folk influences of Springsteen&#x27;s 1973 debut album &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; and was instead characterized by &quot;a grand fusion of nostalgic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and soulful R&amp;B&quot;.

==Artwork and name==
The back photo for the album featured six members of Springsteen&#x27;s backing E Street Band standing in a doorway of an antique store on Sairs Ave in the West End section of Long Branch, New Jersey. The building was across the street from West End Elementary School, and for years was Tommy Reed&#x27;s bicycle repair shop and penny candy store; it has since been demolished and its former location is occupied by a parking lot.

The album was named in part after the 1959 Audie Murphy--Sandra Dee film, &quot;The Wild and the Innocent&quot;.

== Release ==
There is disagreement on &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;&#x27;s release date between official sources and third-party sources, including various Springsteen biographies covering the era. Springsteen&#x27;s official website provides a release date of September 11, 1973; however, it is known that Springsteen was still in the studio recording for the album past this date. Indeed, September 23 was the final recording date, and after mixing and sequencing tweaks, the album was released on November 5, 1973. However, there was very little press, no advertisements in the trade papers and no release party, possibly because of Springsteen&#x27;s deteriorating relationship with Columbia Records, and the departures of John Hammond and Clive Davis, the men who had signed him as a Columbia artist. This situation would continue, and would almost result in the termination of Springsteen&#x27;s contract in 1974.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot; sold poorly when it was first released in 1973 but received acclaim from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ken Emerson said that its lengthy, vividly written songs make for a more challenging and romantic album than &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot;, but still retain that album&#x27;s ebullient music because of Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s masterful playing. In a less enthusiastic review for &quot;Creem&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that it does not cohere as a whole, although its livelier songs make it &quot;the kind of album that will be fun to go back to&quot; if Springsteen improves upon it. According to him in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Springsteen eschewed the limiting folk conventions of his first album for a vibrant, quirky style of rock and roll that balances his celebrations of wild youth with a mature embrace of city life: &quot;This guy may not be God yet, but he has his sleeveless undershirt in the ring.&quot;

&quot;The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle&quot; made its first appearance on the British albums chart on June 15, 1985. In the wake of Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A. Tour&quot; arriving in Britain, the record hit number 33 and remained in the Top 100 for 12 weeks. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (1992) later called the album a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, &quot;cinematic in its sweep&quot; and densely poetic with &quot;vignettes of urban dreams and adolescent restlessness&quot;. &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine&#x27;s Rush Evans said it was not only a five-star album but also Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;most overlooked album ... to those who know its seven richly vivid songs, it is recognized as an innovative masterpiece.&quot; Reviewing it for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann felt the record epitomized Springsteen&#x27;s romanticized songwriting and diversity as a composer, making it his best work and &quot;one of the greatest albums in the history of rock &amp; roll&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the record at number 132 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 133 in a 2012 revised list. Writing in &quot;Hot Press&quot;, Pat Carty declared &quot;if I want to beam like an idiot and remember why I fell in love with music in the first place, this is the Springsteen record I put on&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot was less enthusiastic and remarked only on how the record was highlighted by the beautiful three-song suite that ended it.

== Rejected songs ==
On November 4 and 5, 1997, eight tracks not included on &quot;The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle&quot; were mixed and evaluated for inclusion on the &quot;Tracks&quot; box set, to be released in 1998. They included &quot;Zero and Blind Terry&quot;, &quot;Thundercrack&quot;, &quot;Seaside Bar Song&quot;, &quot;Santa Ana&quot;, &quot;Bishop Danced&quot;, &quot;Evacuation of the West&quot; aka &quot;No More Kings In Texas&quot;, &quot;Phantoms&quot; and &quot;Fire on the Wing&quot;. The first five, which included a live version of &quot;Bishop Danced&quot;, recorded on January 31, 1973, at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, New York City, were included; &quot;Phantoms&quot;, &quot;Fire on the Wing&quot; and &quot;No More Kings/Evacuation&quot; remain officially unreleased.

&quot;The Fever&quot;, recorded in a single take on May 16, 1973, was also rejected and disliked by Springsteen. His manager at the time, Mike Appel, without informing Springsteen or Columbia Records, sent a cassette of the song to approximately forty disc jockeys across the US, including Ed Sciaky in Philadelphia, Kid Leo in Cleveland, and other DJs in Boston, New York, Houston, and Dallas. The song was then included on an endless stream of bootlegs, and was well known to Springsteen fans as one of his best songs. When it failed to appear on &quot;Tracks&quot;, along with &quot;The Promise&quot;, another highly regarded unreleased song, a backlash occurred among fans on the Internet. In response, a second release, &quot;18 Tracks&quot;, was hastily assembled and released on April 13, 1999, with both songs included.

<text>In Hindu literature, Andhaka (Sanskrit: अन्धक, IAST: Andhaka; lit. &quot;He who darkens&quot;) refers to a malevolent asura, whose pride is vanquished by Shiva and Parvati.

His story finds mention in various Hindu texts, including the &quot;Matsya Purāṇa&quot;, the &quot;Kūrma Purāṇa&quot;, the &quot;Liṅga Purāṇa&quot;, the &quot;Padma Purana,&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;. He is believed to have one thousand heads, and one thousand arms, and also having two thousand eyes. In another version, he has two thousand arms, and two thousand legs. In some versions of his story, Andhaka is described as a son of Shiva and Parvati.

==In Puranic Scriptures==
===Shiva Purana===

In the Shiva Purana, when Shiva was meditating on Mount Mandara, Parvati was in a playful mood and covered Shiva&#x27;s eyes. This caused the whole universe to become covered in darkness. The sweat that oozed out of Parvati&#x27;s hands, due to touching Shiva&#x27;s powerful third eye, fell to the ground and created a horrible looking and blind boy. Parvati was terrified on seeing him, but Shiva rebuked her, claiming that since he was born due to their physical contact, he was their child.

When the demon king Hiraṇyākṣa performed penance to please Shiva in order to beget a child, Shiva gifted the boy to him and named him Andhaka due to his blindness. After Hiraṇyākṣa&#x27;s death by Varaha (avatar of Vishnu), Andhaka became the new king, but was not regarded as an Asura since he was born of the Devas. Disowned by majority of his clan, he performed a severe penance to please Brahmā. Brahmā thus appeared to him and offered him a boon. Andhaka requested that Brahmā give and make divine vision and immortality. Brahmā granted Andhaka these wishes, but warned him that he could still be killed by Shiva. Andhaka went back to his kingdom and subdued all his opponents as well as the Devas.

Andhaka asked his minister if there was anyone who could match him in strength, majesty and riches. The minister informed him that he did not have the company of a beautiful woman. The world&#x27;s most beautiful woman, he explained, was Parvati, who belonged to a matted ascetic who lived on Mount Kailāśa. Andhaka was advised that if he wished to be truly matchless, he should possess her. Andhaka sent a messenger to Shiva with the demand to hand over his wife. Andhaka attacked Shiva with his greatest warriors, but they were defeated by Shiva&#x27;s army.

One day, when Shiva was performing meditation in forest, Andhaka thought of attacking Mandar mountain. Terrible war took place between gods and danavs.

Andhaka&#x27;s trusted general Bali single-handedly defeated all the gods and swallowed them. Shiva fired powerful weapons at Bali, which forced him to disgorge all the gods. In retaliation, Shiva swallowed Śukra, the guru of the Asuras. Andhaka then launched an attack on Indra. Shiva intervened to save Indra and assaulted the demon with his trident. However, whenever Andhaka&#x27;s blood fell on the ground, a copy of him would spawn. Vishnu created several Mātṛkās to drink the blood of the demon every time he was hurt, preventing the spread of new demons. Finally, Shiva decapitated Andhaka. According to Shiva Purana, in a twist of events, since Andhaka had chanted Shiva&#x27;s name in repentance after which he was told of his biological parentage and he was made a Gaṇa chief.

====Alternate account====

There is another version in
the Purāṇa in which Andhaka&#x27;s birth story and disownment by his clan remains the same. His kingdom was taken over by his cousins, including Prahlāda, when he went to the forest to perform penance to Brahmā. During his penance he abstained from both water and food while severing his own limbs as an act of desperation to please Brahmā.

His actions proved successful. A pleased Brahmā appeared before him and offered him a boon of his choice. Andhaka asked Brahma to repair his vision and also asked him to make him immortal. Brahmā replied that he could not make him immortal since all that take birth must die, although he could choose the condition of his death. Andhaka asked that he could only be killed if he lusted after a woman who was like a mother. Brahma agreed and granted all his boons.

When Andhaka returned to his kingdom, his cousins became fearful of his new power and returned his kingdom as well as their own. After becoming the lord of all Asuras, Andhaka fought with the Devas along with his army and conquered heaven. He then proceeded to conquer the Nāgas, Gandharvas, Rākṣasas, Yakṣas and the humans. He thus became the lord of the three worlds.

He was a cruel ruler and disrespected the Vedas, the Brahmins and the Devas. Once while on a journey, Andhaka happened to visit Mount Mandara. Charmed by the beauty of the mountain, he decided to stay there and ordered his three generals Duryodhana, Vighasa and Hasti to search for a place suitable to stay.

While searching, his generals found a cave where a hermit was meditating and saw a beautiful woman along with him. They told their master about this, who ordered them to bring the woman to him. The hermit happened to be Shiva and the woman his wife Parvati. When they told the ascetic to hand over the woman to their master, Shiva refused, stating that if their master wanted her, he should take her himself.

When his generals informed Andhaka about this, he became furious and proceeded to fight Shiva. With his army of Asuras, Andhaka fought Nandi and Shiva&#x27;s Gaṇas, but were defeated and forced to flee. Andhaka soon returned to battle, which lasted for seven hundred years.

Vishnu, Brahmā and the Devas joined the battle against Andhaka and his army. Andhaka&#x27;s general Vighasa swallowed all the gods, to which Shiva retaliated by charging with his bull and plowing into the demon. Śukra, the preceptor of Asura, brought the dead Asuras back to life by using his medicinal herb, the Mṛtasañjīvanī. Shiva ordered the Gaṇas to capture Śukra. When they brought him to Shiva, he swallowed the demon guru.

Shiva attacked Andhaka with his trident, but every drop of Andhaka&#x27;s blood that fell to the ground spawned another demon like him. Shiva requested the goddess chandi to drink the blood while he took care of the rest of Andhaka&#x27;s duplicates. After vanquishing the remaining Asura, Shiva impaled Andhaka with his trident and lifted him thereupon, where he remained for a very long time. Once he had realised that the woman who he was lusting for was his own mother and her husband was his own father, he felt deeply grieved and ashamed of his actions. He sincerely prayed to Shiva for forgiveness. Shiva, the most humble one, forgave him and made him the chief of the Gaṇas.

===Vāmana Purāṇa===
In the Vāmana Purāṇa, the story of Andhaka&#x27;s birth remains same. Andhaka was the son of Hiraṇyākṣa and cousin of Prahlāda. Andhaka and Prahlāda, along with their army defeated the Devas, making Prahlāda the king of the three worlds. Sometime later, Prahlāda battled Vishnu, but lost the battle due to a curse the sages have placed upon him. After his loss, he appointed Andhaka as king and successfully acquires Vishnu&#x27;s forgiveness. Upon returning, Andhaka tries to make him king again, but is met with refusal. At one point, Mahiṣāsura and Tārakāsura are killed by the gods, a feat which Andhaka thought was impossible.

After this incident, Andhaka came to desire a beautiful wife and was informed about Parvati, said to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Unaware that Parvati is his mother, Andhaka makes his way to Shiva&#x27;s abode. There he tried to abduct Parvati, but she assumed a hundred forms and knocked him unconscious in battle. Andhaka fled back to Pātāla with the intention to recuperate and make another attempt at procuring Parvati.

Prahlāda tried to dissuade him. He revealed to Andhaka his true origins about being born from the sweat of Shiva when Parvati covered his eyes. His explanation falls on deaf ears and he fails to persuade the Asura. Andhaka attacked Shiva and the other deities with his army, most of whom were obliterated. Andhaka then disguised himself as Shiva to fool Parvati, but she managed to recognised him and hid among her servants. Unable to find her, Andhaka returns to the battle.

Kārttikeya and Gaṇeśa, accompanied by the Gaṇas, destroyed Andhaka&#x27;s chariot. Shiva engaged him in battle and pierced his heart, but Andhaka was able to recover and strike Shiva with his mace. The blood that fell on the ground from the wound gave rise to the eight forms of Bhairava.

Shiva impaled Andhaka on his trident and lifted him upon it. The sweat that emanated from Shiva gave rise to a girl and a boy of the colour of charcoal, who proceed to consume Andhaka&#x27;s blood before it falls onto the ground. Shiva names the girl Cārcikā and the boy Maṅgala. He holds Andhaka impaled on his trident for thousands of years, reducing his body to a mere skeletal appearance. Andhaka begged for forgiveness and prostrated in front of Shiva as his father and Parvati as his mother. He is forgiven and made a Gaṇa chief. Shiva takes him to the Mandara mountain where Parvati also blesses the same boon to him and he later becomes famous by the name of Bhṛṅgi.

===Kūrma Purāṇa===
In the Kūrma Purāṇa too, Andhaka is the natural son of Hiraṇyākṣa and becomes the king of the Asuras after the death of Prahlāda. Like other variants, he lusts after Parvati and goes to Mount Mandara to abduct her when Shiva is away. Shiva had entrusted Nandi to guard his household and the gods including Vishnu, to attend to and protect Parvati. When Andhaka arrives, Nandi battles with him and pierces him with a trident. Upon spilling of his blood, a thousand more Asura like him spawn and defeat Nandi and the Devas. Nandi prays to Vishnu for aid.

When Vishnu arrives he creates several Mātṛkā goddesses who vanquish the demons. When Shiva returns, Andhaka returns in another attempt to abduct Parvati. Shiva and Vishnu wage battle against Andhaka and his army. Shiva succeeds in impaling Andhaka on his trident and begins to dance. By his mere touch, Andhaka&#x27;s sins are burned away and he begs for forgiveness. He is later named a Gaṇa chief. Shiva also makes Andhaka a handsome man who then prostrates before Parvati in repentance. Parvati forgives him and accepts him as her son.

===Matsya Purāṇa===

In the Matsya Purāṇa, Andhaka, the son of Hiraṇyākṣa, tries to abduct Parvati from Shiva. A battle ensues in the Mahākāla forest and the blood that flows from Andhaka gives rise to a thousand more demons. Shiva creates numerous divine mothers, the Mātṛkā, who drink the demon&#x27;s blood every time it issues forth. After they become satiated, Vāsudeva creates the goddess Śuṣkarevatī who drinks the blood of all the demons and kills them. When Shiva is about to blow the final strike, Andhaka surrenders and begs for forgiveness by praying to him. Pleased by his devotion, Shiva makes him a Gaṇa.

===Harivaṃśa Purana===

According to the Harivaṃśa Purāṇa, Andhaka was a Daitya and the son of Diti and the sage Kaśyapa. After the defeat of Daityas by Vishnu, Diti pleaded with Kaśyapa to give her such a son who couldn&#x27;t be defeated by the gods. Kaśyapa granted her boon and told her that only Shiva had the power to destroy her son, as no one could match his power. Kaśyapa then touched her belly and a child was born with a thousand eyes and limbs. Although he wasn&#x27;t blind, Andhaka walked like a blind person, thus bearing the name. Over time, Andhaka became arrogant since he cannot be harmed by anyone.

At one time, Andhaka went to the court of Indra, abducted all the Apsaras, and defeated all of the gods in battle. He also hindered the performance of yajñas by the gods. Being so tormented, the gods approached Nārada for assistance. Nārada visited Andhaka to counsel with him. Andhaka was intrigued by the fragrant garland of Mandara flowers worn by Nārada and inquired as to the source of the flowers. Nārada tells him that the flowers come from the Mandara forest, protected by guards so that no one may enter without Shiva&#x27;s permission.

Andhaka conversed with Mount Mandara, informing the mountain of his invulnerability, and asked about the whereabouts of the forest. The mountain refuses to answer and disappears. Andhaka erupts in anger and uproots the entire mountain and with the help of his Asura army. They manage to grind the mountain down, destroying all of its natural beauty. Once Shiva become informed of this, he blesses the mountain with a boon which restored it to its original splendor. The mountain summits began to kill the Asuras who had attempted to destroy them. Upon seeing this, Andhaka calls out the owner of the mountain, wishing to burn the entire Mandara mountain. In response, Shiva, with his mace, mounts his bull and charges Andhaka. When Shiva releases his spear, it strikes the demon in the chest and reduces him to ash.

===Liṅga Purāṇa===

In the Liṅga Purāṇa, Andhaka&#x27;s story is related as a variation of accounts of Harvamsa and Kurma Purana. Andhaka was the son of Hiraṇyākṣa and was given immunity to death by Brahmā after he performed a severe penance. He traversed the three worlds and conquered the heavens. The Devas retreated to Mount Mandara, where the demon followed them. Shiva, on the request of the Devas, challenges Andhaka, destroys his army and impales him on his trident. However, the divine sight of Shiva burns away all of Andhaka&#x27;s sins, prompting the latter to eulogizing him. Shiva was pleased with his devotion and forgave him, making him the chief of all his Gaṇas.

It is here that the reader is informed that Andhaka&#x27;s son is Āḍi.

====Alternate account====

Another version of the tale states that Andhaka fought with the Gaṇas and Shiva&#x27;s sons, but that the gods lost the battle. Shiva sends Vīrabhadra to battle it out with Andhaka, but every time Vīrabhadra kills Andhaka, another form arises from his blood that falls upon the earth. Parvati becomes furious and assumes the form of Kālī. She destroys each and every copy of Andhaka, except for the real one, who is saved by Shiva and given a new life.

==In the Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata==

In the Rāmāyaṇa, the story of Kālī killing Andhaka is briefly noted in Chapter 30 of the Araṇya Kāṇḍa, at the moment when Khara, the younger brother of Rāvaṇa is killed by Rāma. The scripture reads that Andhaka was killed by Shiva&#x27;s third eye in the forest of the sage Śveta.

In the Mahābhārata, Andhaka is killed by Kālī, though not by his third eye as in the Rāmāyaṇa.

<text>Angiras ( (stem), , , nominative singular , , , rendered Angirā in Hindi) was a Vedic rishi (sage) of Hinduism. He is described in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; as a teacher of divine knowledge, a mediator between men and gods, as well as stated in other hymns to be the first of Agni-devas (fire gods). In some texts, he is considered to be one of the seven great sages or &quot;Saptarishis&quot;, but in others he is mentioned but not counted in the list of seven great sages. In some manuscripts of &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, the text is attributed to &quot;Atharvangirasah&quot;, which is a compound of sage Atharvan and Angira. The student family of Angira are called &quot;Angira&quot;, and they are credited to be the authors of some hymns in the first, second, fifth, eighth, ninth, and tenth books of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. By the time of the composition of the Rigveda, the Angirases were an old Rishi clan, and were stated to have participated in several events.

==Texts==
Many hymns of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; credit the Angirases as their authors, mainly in Mandalas I and VIII. Various Angirasa sub-clans, including the Śunahotras, the Gautamas, and the Bhāradvājas composed Mandalas II, IV, and VI respectively.

Other than crediting authorship, the Vedic texts mention sage Angiras in various roles such as a fire priest or a singer. For example, the allegorical hymn 3.31 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; calls him a singer:

According to Max Muller—a professor of Sanskrit and Indology at the Oxford University—the sage Angiras in Vedic literature is different from the plural term &quot;Angirasa&quot;, and these terms refer to different people. The &quot;Angiras&quot; rishi is different from the group of sorcerers in &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; also named &quot;Angirasa&quot;, and according to Muller, the Vedic rishi is also different from a class of divine beings who too are called &quot;Angirasa&quot; in the Vedic texts and described as &quot;sprung from coals (&quot;angara&quot;)&quot;.

In Buddhist Pali canonical texts such as &quot;Digha Nikaya&quot;, Tevijja Sutta describes a discussion between the Buddha and Vedic scholars of his time. The Buddha names ten rishis, calls them &quot;early sages&quot; and makers of ancient verses that have been collected and chanted in his era, and among those ten rishis is Angiras.

==Life in Puranas==
The name Angirasas is applied generically to several Puranic individuals. Further, the Vedic sage Angiras appears in medieval Hindu texts with contradictory roles as well as many different versions of his birth, marriage and biography. In some, he is described to be the son of Brahma, in others he is one of many Prajapatis. Depending on the legend, he has one, two or four wives. In one myth, his wife is stated to be Surūpa and his sons are Utathya, Samvartana and Brahaspati. Other accounts say that he married Smriti (memory), the daughter of Daksha and later married Svadha (oblation). Yet other Puranic accounts state, he married &quot;Shubha&quot; and they had seven daughters named after aspects of &quot;fire&quot; and a son named Brihaspati. In some legends, sage Brihaspati is his son.

According to one legend, Angirasa turned his senses inwards and meditated on Para Brahman, the creator of the creator, for several years. The great Tejas he got by birth had multiplied infinitely by his penance. He attained many divine qualities, powers, and riches, and control over many worlds. But he was oblivious of all the worldly attainments and did not stop his penance. Due to this penance he became one with the Para-Brahman and thus attained the state of “Brahmarshi”. He had visions of many Vedic Mantras and brought them to this earthly world. He is credited as being the source of great number of Vedic Hymns and mantras and also believed to have introduced fire-worship along with sage Bhrigu.

He is one of Saptarishis in the Puranas.

Ghora of the Angiras family is identified by some scholars as Neminatha, the twenty-second &quot;tirthankara&quot; in Jainism.

<text>Annapurna (; ) is a mountain situated in the Annapurna mountain range of Gandaki Province, north-central Nepal. It is the 10th highest mountain in the world at above sea level and is well known for the difficulty and danger involved in its ascent.

Maurice Herzog led a French expedition to its summit through the north face in 1950, making it the first eight-thousander to be successfully climbed. The entire massif and surrounding area are protected within the Annapurna Conservation Area, the first and largest conservation area in Nepal. The Annapurna Conservation Area is home to several world-class treks, including Annapurna Sanctuary and Annapurna Circuit.

For decades, Annapurna I held the highest fatality-to-summit rate of all principal eight-thousander summits; it has, however, seen great climbing successes in recent years, with the fatality rate falling from 32% to under 20% from 2012 to 2022. This figure places it just under the most recent fatality rate estimates for K2, at about 24%. The mountain still poses grave threats to climbers through avalanche danger, unpredictable weather and the extremely steep and committing nature of its climbing routes, in particular its south face, renowned as one of the most difficult climbs in the world. It is also a dangerous peak for trekkers, as in the case of a 2014 snowstorm near it and Dhaulagiri which claimed at least 43 lives. As of 2022, 365 people had reached the summit of Annapurna I, while 72 had died in the attempt.

==Etymology==
The mountain is named after Annapurna, the Hindu goddess of food and nourishment, who is said to reside there. The name Annapurna is derived from the Sanskrit-language words &quot;purna&quot; (&quot;filled&quot;) and &quot;anna&quot; (&quot;food&quot;), and can be translated as &quot;everlasting food&quot;. Many streams descending from the slopes of the Annapurna Massif provide water for the agricultural fields and pastures located at lower elevations.

==Climbing expeditions==

Annapurna I was the first peak to be climbed. Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal, of the French Annapurna expedition led by Herzog (including Lionel Terray, Gaston Rébuffat, Marcel Ichac, Jean Couzy, Marcel Schatz, Jacques Oudot, Francis de Noyelle), reached the summit on 3 June 1950. Ichac made a documentary of the expedition, called &quot;Victoire sur l&#x27;Annapurna&quot;. Its summit was the highest summit attained till that time, but not the highest climb; higher non-summit points – at least – had already been attained on Mount Everest in the 1920s.

The south face of Annapurna was first climbed in 1970 by Don Whillans and Dougal Haston also without using supplementary oxygen, members of a British expedition led by Chris Bonington that included Ian Clough, who was killed by a falling serac during the descent. They were, however, beaten to the second ascent of Annapurna by a matter of days by a British Army expedition led by Colonel Henry Day.

In 1978, the American Women&#x27;s Himalayan Expedition, a team led by Arlene Blum, became the first United States team to climb Annapurna I. The first summit team, composed of Vera Komarkova and Irene Miller, and Sherpas Mingma Tsering and Chewang Ringjing, reached the top at 3:30 pm on 15 October 1978. The second summit team, Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz and Vera Watson, died during this climb.

In 1981 Polish expedition Zakopane Alpine Club set a new route on Annapurna I Central (8051 m). Maciej Berbeka and Bogusław Probulski reached the summit on 23 May 1981. The route called Zakopiańczyków Way was recognized as the best achievement of the Himalayan season in 1981.

On 3 February 1987, Polish climbers Jerzy Kukuczka and Artur Hajzer made the first winter ascent of Annapurna I.

The first solo ascent of the south face was made in October 2007 by Slovenian climber Tomaž Humar; he climbed to the Roc Noir and then to Annapurna East (8,047m).

On 8 and 9 October 2013 Swiss climber Ueli Steck soloed the Lafaille route on the main and highest part of the face; this was his third attempt on the route and has been called &quot;one of the most impressive Himalayan climbs in history&quot;, with Steck taking 28 hours to make the trip from Base Camp to summit and back again. There are significant doubts about this claim.

===Flights===
Several airlines offer sightseeing flights over Annapurna.

==Fatality rate==
Along with K2 and Nanga Parbat, Annapurna I has consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous of the principal eight-thousander summits. Climbers killed on the peak include Britons Ian Clough in 1970 and Alex MacIntyre in 1982, Frenchman Pierre Béghin in 1992, Kazakh Anatoli Boukreev in 1997, Spaniard Iñaki Ochoa in 2008, Korean Park Young-seok in 2011 and the Finn Samuli Mansikka in 2015.

<doc id="100368" wikidata="Q83090" url="?curid=100368" title="Avatar">
<text>Avatar (, ; ) is a concept within Hinduism that in Sanskrit literally means . It signifies the material appearance or incarnation of a powerful deity, or spirit on Earth. The relative verb to &quot;alight, to make one&#x27;s appearance&quot; is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being.

The word &quot;avatar&quot; does not appear in the Vedic literature; however, it appears in developed forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE. Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism. The &quot;Rigveda&quot; describes Indra as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will. The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than &quot;avatar&quot;.

Theologically, the term is most often associated with the Hindu god Vishnu, though the idea has been applied to other deities. Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures, including the ten Dashavatara of the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; and the twenty-two avatars in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable. The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology. In the goddess-based Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, avatars of the Devi in different appearances such as Tripura Sundari, Durga, Chandi, Chamunda, Mahakali, and Kali are commonly found. While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional. The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.

Incarnation concepts that are in some aspects similar to &quot;avatar&quot; are also found in Buddhism, Christianity, and other religions.

The scriptures of Sikhism include the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses, but it rejected the doctrine of savior incarnation and endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev, that formless eternal god is within the human heart, and man is his own savior.

==Etymology and meaning==
The Sanskrit noun (, ) is derived from the Sanskrit prefix and the root . These roots trace back, states Monier-Williams, to &quot;-taritum&quot;, &quot;-tarati&quot;, &quot;-rītum&quot;.

&quot;Avatar&quot; means , and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form. The word also implies &quot;to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something&quot;. In Hindu traditions, the &quot;crossing or coming down&quot; is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from &quot;eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude&quot;. An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a &quot;saguna&quot; (with form, attributes) embodiment of the &quot;nirguna&quot; Brahman or Atman (soul). Avatar, according to 
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati actually means in his commentaries of The Shrimad Bhagavatam and The Bramha Samhita (mentioned in Brahmavaivarta Purana).

Neither the Vedas nor the Principal Upanishads ever mention the word &quot;avatar&quot; as a noun. The verb roots and form, such as , appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as &quot;action of descending&quot;, but not as an incarnated person (avatara). The related verb is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as &quot;laying down the burden of man&quot; suffering from the forces of evil.

The term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god Vishnu. The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to establish Dharma on Earth, uses other terms such as the word &quot;sambhavāmi&quot; in verse 4.6 and the word &quot;tanu&quot; in verse 9.11 of the Bhagavad Gita, as well as other words such as &quot;akriti&quot; and &quot;rupa&quot; elsewhere. It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity. The idea proliferates thereafter, in the Puranic stories for many deities, and with ideas such as &quot;ansha-avatar&quot; or partial embodiments.

The term &quot;avatar&quot;, in colloquial use, is also an epithet or a word of reverence for any extraordinary human being who is revered for his or her ideas. In some contexts, the term &quot;avatara&quot; just means a , or just , or retranslation of a text in another language. The term &quot;avatar&quot; is not unique to Hinduism even though the term originated with Hinduism. It is found in the &quot;Trikaya&quot; doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, in descriptions for the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, and many ancient cultures.

===Avatar versus incarnation===
The manifest embodiment is sometimes referred to as an incarnation. The translation of avatar as &quot;incarnation&quot; has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect. The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in Christology, presents the Christian concept of incarnation. The term avatar in Hinduism refers to act of various gods taking form to perform a particular task which in most of the times is bringing dharma back. The concept of avatar is widely accepted all over the India. Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar. Avatars are embodiments of spiritual perfection, driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism. The concept of the avatar in Hinduism is not incompatible with natural conception through a sexual act, which is again different from the Christian concept of the Virgin Birth.

===As a loanword===

Following 19th Century Western interest in Indian culture and Hinduism, the word &quot;Avatar&quot; was taken as loanword into English and other Western languages, where it is used in various contexts and meanings, often considerably different from its original meaning in Hinduism - see Avatar (disambiguation).

The concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu&#x27;s avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring Dharma. Traditional Hindus see themselves not as &quot;Hindu&quot;, but as Vaishnava (Worshippers of Vishnu), Shaiva (Worshippers of Shiva), or Shakta (Worshipper of the Shakti). Each of the deities has its own iconography and mythology, but common to all is the fact that the divine reality has an explicit form, a form that the worshipper can behold. An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:

The Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance. The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.

The most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna, Rama, Narayana and Vasudeva. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts. The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.

===Dashavatara===
The Bhagavata Purana describes Vishnu&#x27;s avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations, the Dashavatara, are celebrated therein as his major appearances. The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the Agni Purana, the Garuda Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.

The ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the &quot;Dashavatara&quot; (a Sanskrit compound meaning &quot;ten avatars&quot;). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limited to the abstract.

===Longer alternatives===
The Bhagavata Purana also goes on to give an alternate list, wherein it numerically lists out 23 Vishnu avatars in chapter 1.3.

# Four Kumaras (Catuḥsana): the four sons of Brahma who exemplify the path of devotion.
# Varaha: The boar avatar. He rescues Bhumi, the goddess of the earth, when the asura Hiranyaksha abducts her, restoring her rightful place in the universe.
# Narada: the divine-sage who travels the worlds as a devotee of Vishnu.

# Kalki: The prophesied tenth avatar of Vishnu. He incarnates to bring an end to the present age of corruption called the Kali Yuga, re-establishing the four classes and law to the world.

Avatars like Hayagriva, Hamsa, and Garuda are also mentioned in the Pancharatra, making a total of forty-six avatars. However, despite these lists, the commonly accepted number of ten avatars for Vishnu was fixed well before the 10th century CE. Madhvacharya also regards Gautama Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu.

===Types===

The &quot;avatar&quot; concept was further developed and refined in later Hindu texts. One approach was to identify full avatars and partial avatars. Krishna, Rama, and Narasimha were full avatars (&quot;purna avatars&quot;), while others were partial avatars (&quot;ansha avatars&quot;). Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an &quot;avatar&quot; of Vishnu. The Pancharatra text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu&#x27;s avatars include those that are direct and complete (), indirect and endowed (), cosmic and salvific (), inner and inspirational (), consecrated and in the form of image ().

Yet another classification, developed in Krishna schools, centers around &quot;Guna-avatars&quot;, &quot;Purusha-avatars&quot; and &quot;Lila-avatars&quot;, with their subtypes. The &quot;Guna-avatar&quot; classification of &quot;avatars&quot; is based on the Guṇas concept of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, that is Rajas (Brahma), Sattva (Vishnu), and Tamas (Shiva). These personalities of the Trimurti are referred to as &quot;Guna avatars&quot;. The &quot;Purushavatara&quot; are three. The first evolves all matter (Prakriti), the second is the soul present in each individual creature, the third is the interconnected oneness or Brahman that connects all souls. The &quot;Lilavataras&quot; are partial or full manifestations of Vishnu, where either some powers (Shakti) or material parts of him exist.

Vishnu is Purushavatara. The Matsya, Kurma, and Vamana avatars of Vishnu are Lilavataras. A &quot;Purnarupa&quot; in this classification, is when Vishnu manifests completely along with his qualities and powers. In Bengal Vaishnavism, Krishna is the &quot;Purnarupa&quot;. In Shaivism, Bhairava is the purnarupa of Shiva.

===In Sikhism===
24 avatars of Vishnu are mentioned in Bachitar Natak&#x27;s composition in Dasam Granth, the second scripture of Sikhism written by Guru Gobind Singh:

The Guru Granth Sahib reverentially includes the names of numerous Hindu deities, including Vishnu avatars such as Krishna, Hari, and Rama, as well those of Devi as Durga.

Dasam Granth has three major compositions, one each dedicated to avatars of Vishnu (Chaubis avatar) and Brahma. However, Sikhism rejects the doctrine of savior incarnation, and only accepts the abstract &quot;nirguna&quot; formless god. The Sikh Gurus endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev (≈1270 – 1350 CE) that formless eternal god is within the human heart and man is his own savior.

===In Isma&#x27;ilism===

The Gupti Ismailis, who observe pious circumspection as Hindus, uphold that the first Shi‘i Imam, ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, as well as his descendants through the line of Isma‘il, are collectively Kalki, the tenth and final &quot;avatāra&quot; of Vishnu. According to this interpretation, these figures represent the continuity of divine guidance to humankind. In the view of some Guptis, this is corroborated by the Quranic verse 14:4 which mentions the idea that God had sent a messenger to every land. They understand the &quot;avatāras&quot; to be these messengers sent by God to their people in the Indian subcontinent.

==Avatars of Shiva==
Although Puranic scriptures contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the avatar doctrine is neither universally accepted nor commonly adopted in Shaivism. The views on the doctrine of incarnation has been one of the significant doctrinal differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism, in addition to their differences on the role of householder life versus monastic life for spiritual release. Shaivism is a transcendental theology, where man, with the help of his Guru, is his own savior.

The Linga Purana lists twenty-eight avatars of Shiva. In the Shiva Purana there is a distinctly Saivite version of a traditional avatar myth: Shiva brings forth Virabhadra, one of his terrifying forms, in order to calm Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu. When that fails, Shiva manifests as the human-lion-bird Sharabha which calms down lion-man Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, and Shiva then gives Vishnu a chakra (not to be confused with Sudarshan Chakra) as gift. A similar story is told in the late medieval era Sharabha Upanishad. However, Vaishnava Dvaita school refutes this Shaivite view of Narasimha. According to the Shiva Purana, Shiva has 19 avatars. According to the Kurma Purana, he has 28.

The vanara god Hanuman who helped Rama (the Vishnu avatar) is considered by some to be the eleventh avatar of Rudra (Shiva). Some regional deities like Khandoba are also believed by some to be avatars of Shiva. Ashwatthama, the son of Drona is also considered to be an avatar of Shiva.

Shesha and his avatars (Balarama and Lakshmana) are occasionally linked to Shiva. Adi Shankara, the formulator of Advaita Vedanta, is also occasionally regarded as an avatar of Shiva.

In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.

==Avatars of Devis ==

Avatars are also observed in Shaktism, the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (Devi), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous as – much as the Bhagavata Purana does with the avatars of Vishnu.

Nilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana – which includes the Devi Gita – says that various avatars of the Goddess includes Shakambhari and even the masculine Krishna and Rama – generally thought to be Vishnu&#x27;s avatars. Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati are main goddesses worshipped as Devi avatars.

===Avatars of Parvati===
Devi is popular in her form as Parvati. In Devi Mahatmya she is seen as the Goddess Mahakali, and in Uma Samhita, she is seen as Devi herself. Regarding her incarnations, it varies per sect in Hinduism. She could be all Goddesses as said in Shaivism and some main Shatism interpretations like the Sri kula and Kali Kula families, or just a form of Devi in some other Shaktism interpretations and many Vaishnava interpretations. With this in mind, Parvati&#x27;s forms include:
* Mahakali
* Sati
* Mahavidyas- Kali, Tara, Tripurasundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi
* The Shakta pithas
* Navadurgas - Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidhatri 
* Annapurna
* Kaushiki
* Durga
*Shitala
* Maheshwari 
* Ardhanarishvara 
* Vindhyavasini 
* Bhramari 
* Shakambhari 
* Raktadantika 
* Twarita
*In North India- Khodiyar, Bahuchara Mata, Naina Devi, Jwala etc.
* In Western India- Bhavani, Saptashrungi, Ekvira, Amba etc.
* In East India-Dakshina Kali, Kamakhya, Jagadhatri etc.
* In South India- Meenakshi, Vishalakshi, Kamakshi, Abhirami, Mookambika, Akilandeswari, Mariamman, Karumariamman etc.

All of these incarnations helped provide security to the world and even brought Shiva into the participation of worldly affairs.

===Avatars of Lakshmi===
Like Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as in many forms to help provide order and to enlighten the world with her consort. She has many forms, and just like Parvati, some of her forms are not consistent throughout all sects and interpretations of Hinduism. In Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, Lakshmi is seen as Devi herself. She could be every Goddess as said in Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, or just another form of Devi as seen in other interpretations of Shaktism and in Shaivism. With this in mind, Lakshmi&#x27;s forms include:
* Mahalakshmi
* At 108 Divya Desam
* Ashtalakshmi - Adi Lakshmi, Dhanya Lakshmi, Dhana Lakshmi, Gaja Lakshmi, Santana Lakshmi, Vidya Lakshmi, Veera Lakshmi, Vijaya Lakshmi
* With avatars of Vishnu - Sita, Radha, Ashtasakhi, Gopi, Rukmini, Ashtabharya, Junior wives of Krishna, Padmavathi, Lakshmi Narayana, Andal, Dharini
* Singular forms - Vedavati, Chottanikkara Bhagavathy, Mookambika devi, Vaishno Devi, As Kolhapur ambabai
* Matrikas - Vaishnavi, Varahi, Narasimhi
* 3 forms of Lakshmi in Sri Vaishnava - Sri, Bhumi, Nila
* Mahavidya Kamalatmika

==Avatars of Brahma==
In Dasam Granth, second scriptures of Sikhs written by Guru Gobind Singh, mentioned seven Brahma Avatars.
#Valmiki
#Kashyapa
#Shukra
#Baches
#Vyasa
#Khat
#Kalidasa
Khat avatar in this list refers to six different scholars who are considered to be founders of six schools of Indian philosophy. According to the Skanda Purana, Brahma incarnated himself as Yajnavalkya in response to a curse from Shiva. 

==Avatars of Ganesha==
The Linga Purana declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people. The two Upapuranas – Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana – detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the Ganapatya sect – exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.

Four avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana: Mohotkata, Mayūreśvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose – to slay demons.

The Mudgala Puranam describes eight avatars of Ganesha:
#Vakratunda () (&quot;twisting trunk&quot;), his mount is a lion.
#Ekadanta (&quot;single tusk&quot;), his mount is a mouse.
#Mahodara (&quot;big belly&quot;), his mount is a mouse.
#Gajavaktra (or Gajānana) (&quot;elephant face&quot;), his mount is a mouse.
#Lambodara (&quot;pendulous belly&quot;), his mount is a mouse.
#Vikata () (&quot;unusual form&quot;, &quot;misshapen&quot;), his mount is a peacock.
#Vighnaraja () (&quot;king of obstacles&quot;), his mount is the celestial serpent .
#Dhumravarna () (&quot;grey color&quot;) corresponds to Śiva, his mount is a horse.

==Avatars of Varuna==

Jhulelal, the Iṣṭa-devatā (most-revered deity) of Sindhi Hindus, is considered the incarnation of Varuna.

<text>In financial accounting, a balance sheet (also known as statement of financial position or statement of financial condition) is a summary of the financial balances of an individual or organization, whether it be a sole proprietorship, a business partnership, a corporation, private limited company or other organization such as government or not-for-profit entity. Assets, liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date, such as the end of its financial year. A balance sheet is often described as a &quot;snapshot of a company&#x27;s financial condition&quot;. It is the summary of each and every financial statement of an organization.

Of the four basic financial statements, the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business&#x27;s calendar year.

A standard company balance sheet has two sides: assets on the left, and financing on the right–which itself has two parts; liabilities and ownership equity. The main categories of assets are usually listed first, and typically in order of liquidity. Assets are followed by the liabilities. The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation, net worth must equal assets minus liabilities.

Another way to look at the balance sheet equation is that total assets equals liabilities plus owner&#x27;s equity. Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner&#x27;s money (owner&#x27;s or shareholders&#x27; equity). Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections &quot;balancing&quot;.

A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand. However, many businesses are not paid immediately; they build up inventories of goods and acquire buildings and equipment. In other words: businesses have assets and so they cannot, even if they want to, immediately turn these into cash at the end of each period. Often, these businesses owe money to suppliers and to tax authorities, and the proprietors do not withdraw all their original capital and profits at the end of each period. In other words, businesses also have liabilities.

==Types==
A balance sheet summarizes an organization&#x27;s or individual&#x27;s assets, equity and liabilities at a specific point in time. Two forms of balance sheet exist. They are the report form and account form. Individuals and small businesses tend to have simple balance sheets. Larger businesses tend to have more complex balance sheets, and these are presented in the organization&#x27;s annual report. Large businesses also may prepare balance sheets for segments of their businesses. A balance sheet is often presented alongside one for a different point in time (typically the previous year) for comparison.

===Personal===
A personal balance sheet lists current assets such as cash in checking accounts and savings accounts, long-term assets such as common stock and real estate, current liabilities such as loan debt and mortgage debt due, or overdue, long-term liabilities such as mortgage and other loan debt. Securities and real estate values are listed at market value rather than at historical cost or cost basis. Personal net worth is the difference between an individual&#x27;s total assets and total liabilities.

===US small business===
A small business balance sheet lists current assets such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventory, fixed assets such as land, buildings, and equipment, intangible assets such as patents, and liabilities such as accounts payable, accrued expenses, and long-term debt. Contingent liabilities such as warranties are noted in the footnotes to the balance sheet. The small business&#x27;s equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities.

===Charities===
In England and Wales, smaller charities which are not also companies are permitted to file a statement of assets and liabilities instead of a balance sheet. This statement lists the charity&#x27;s main assets and liabilities as at the end of its financial year.
== Public business entities structure ==
Guidelines for balance sheets of public business entities are given by the International Accounting Standards Board and numerous country-specific organizations/companies. The standard used by companies in the US adheres to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) is a United States federal advisory committee whose mission is to develop generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for federal financial reporting entities.

Balance sheet account names and usage depend on the organization&#x27;s country and the type of organization. Government organizations do not generally follow standards established for individuals or businesses.

If applicable to the business, summary values for the following items should be included in the balance sheet:
Assets are all the things the business owns. This will include property, tools, vehicles, furniture, machinery, and so on.

===Assets===
Current assets
# Accounts receivable
# Cash and cash equivalents
# Inventories
# Cash at bank, Petty Cash, Cash On Hand
# Prepaid expenses for future services that will be used within a year
# Revenue Earned In Arrears (Accrued Revenue) for services done but not yet received for the year
# Loan To (Less than one financial period)

Non-current assets (Fixed assets)
# Property, plant and equipment
# Investment property, such as real estate held for investment purposes
# Intangible assets, such as patents, copyrights and goodwill
# Financial assets (excluding investments accounted for using the equity method, accounts receivables, and cash and cash equivalents), such as notes receivables
# Investments accounted for using the equity method
# Biological assets, which are living plants or animals. Bearer biological assets are plants or animals which bear agricultural produce for harvest, such as apple trees grown to produce apples and sheep raised to produce wool.
# Loan To (More than one financial period)

===Liabilities===
# Accounts payable
# Provisions for warranties or court decisions (contingent liabilities that are both probable and measurable)
# Financial liabilities (excluding provisions and accounts payables), such as promissory notes and corporate bonds
# Liabilities and assets for current tax
# Deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets
# Unearned revenue for services paid for by customers but not yet provided
# Interests on loan stock
# Creditors&#x27; equity

===Net current assets===
Net current assets means current assets minus current liabilities.

===Equity / capital===
The net assets shown by the balance sheet equals the third part of the balance sheet, which is known as the shareholders&#x27; equity. It comprises:
# Issued capital and reserves attributable to equity holders of the parent company (controlling interest)
# Non-controlling interest in equity

Formally, shareholders&#x27; equity is part of the company&#x27;s liabilities: they are funds &quot;owing&quot; to shareholders (after payment of all other liabilities); usually, however, &quot;liabilities&quot; are used in the more restrictive sense of liabilities excluding shareholders&#x27; equity. The balance of assets and liabilities (including shareholders&#x27; equity) is not a coincidence. Records of the values of each account in the balance sheet are maintained using a system of accounting known as double-entry bookkeeping. In this sense, shareholders&#x27; equity by construction must equal assets minus liabilities, and thus the shareholders&#x27; equity is considered to be a residual.
Regarding the items in the equity section, the following disclosures are required:
# Numbers of shares authorized, issued and fully-paid, and issued but not fully paid
# Par value of shares
# Reconciliation of shares outstanding at the beginning and the end of the period
# Description of rights, preferences, and restrictions of shares
# Treasury shares, including shares held by subsidiaries and associates
# Shares reserved for issuance under options and contracts
# A description of the nature and purpose of each reserve within owners&#x27; equity

==Substantiation==

Balance sheet substantiation is the accounting process conducted by businesses on a regular basis to confirm that the balances held in the primary accounting system of record (e.g. SAP, Oracle, other ERP system&#x27;s General Ledger) are reconciled (in balance with) with the balance and transaction records held in the same or supporting sub-systems.

Balance sheet substantiation includes multiple processes including reconciliation (at a transactional or at a balance level) of the account, a process of review of the reconciliation and any pertinent supporting documentation and a formal certification (sign-off) of the account in a predetermined form driven by corporate policy.

Balance sheet substantiation is an important process that is typically carried out on a monthly, quarterly and year-end basis. The results help to drive the regulatory balance sheet reporting obligations of the organization.

Historically, balance sheet substantiation has been a wholly manual process, driven by spreadsheets, email and manual monitoring and reporting. In recent years software solutions have been developed to bring a level of process automation, standardization and enhanced control to the balance sheet substantiation or account certification process. These solutions are suitable for organizations with a high volume of accounts and/or personnel involved in the Balance Sheet Substantiation process and can be used to drive efficiencies, improve transparency and help to reduce risk.

Balance sheet substantiation is a key control process in the SOX 404 top-down risk assessment.

==Sample==
The following balance sheet is a very brief example prepared in accordance with IFRS. It does not show all possible kinds of assets, liabilities and equity, but it shows the most usual ones. Because it shows goodwill, it could be a consolidated balance sheet. Monetary values are not shown, summary (subtotal) rows are missing as well.

Under IFRS items are always shown based on liquidity from the least liquid assets at the top, usually land and buildings to the most liquid, i.e. cash. Then liabilities and equity continue from the most immediate liability to be paid (usual account payable) to the least i.e. long-term debt such as mortgages and owner&#x27;s equity at the very bottom.

<text>Apalāla is a water-dwelling Nāga in Buddhist mythology. It is said that Apalāla lived near the Swat River, this area is currently located in Peshawar, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan. He is known to be a Naga King.

Apalāla was converted to Buddhism by the Buddha; this is one of the most popular legends in Buddhist lore and art. The tale is often told to children of Buddhist parents for them to learn their happiness lies in the Buddhist faith.

==In Buddhist texts==

The story of Apalāla&#x27;s conversion (Pali: &quot;Apalāladamana&quot;) does not seem to be found in the Pali Canon, although his name does appear with other beings that honor the Buddha.

The Samantapāsādikā mentions that this story was among those not included in the Three Councils. It is evidenced that it was known in Sri Lanka as it is mentioned among the scenes depicted in the relic-chamber of the Mahāthūpa. The Divyāvadāna also mentions that Apalāla&#x27;s conversion took place shortly before the Buddha&#x27;s death.

<doc id="100376" wikidata="Q2358219" url="?curid=100376" title="Apam Napat">
<text>Apam Napat is a deity in the Indo-Iranian pantheon associated with water. His names in the Vedas, Apām Napāt, and in Zoroastrianism, Apąm Napāt, mean &quot;child of the waters&quot; in Sanskrit and Avestan respectively. &quot;&quot; (&quot;grandson&quot;, &quot;progeny&quot;) is cognate with Latin &quot;nepos&quot; and English &quot;nephew&quot;. In the Rig Veda, he is described as the creator of all things. It is considered to originate from the Proto-Indo-European Hepom Nepōts.

In the Vedas it is often apparent that &quot;Apām Napāt&quot; is being used as a title, not a proper name. This is most commonly applied to Agni, god of fire, and occasionally to Savitr, god of the sun. A correspondence has also been posited by Boyce between both the Vedic and Avestic traditions of Apam Napat, and Varuna, who is also addressed as &quot;Child of the Waters&quot;, and is considered a god of the sea. In the Iranian tradition, he is also called &quot;Burz&quot; (&quot;high one,&quot; ) and is a &quot;yazad&quot;.

==Role==
As a member of the Iranian ahuric triad, along with Ahura Mazda and Mithra, Apąm Napāt – also named Ahura Berezaiti – is an exalted figure. 
In Yasht 19 of the Zoroastrian Avesta &quot;Apąm Napāt&quot; appears as the creator of mankind. However, since in Zoroastrianism Ahura Mazdā is venerated as supreme creator, this function of Apąm Napāt has become reduced. This is one reason &quot;Apąm Napāt&quot; is no longer widely worshipped, though he is still honoured daily through the Zoroastrian liturgies. The creator-god status is also seen in a hymn in honour of the Vedic &quot;Apām Napāt&quot;.

Alongside Mithra, Apąm Napāt maintains order in society, as well as Khvarenah, by which legitimate rule is maintained among the Iranian peoples. It is his duty to distribute water from the sea to all regions.

==Fire and water==
In one Vedic hymn &quot;Apām Napāt&quot; is described as emerging from the water, golden, and &quot;clothed in lightning&quot;, which has been conjectured to be a reference to fire. His regular identification with Agni, who is described a number of times as hiding or residing in water, and comparison with other Indo-European texts, has led some to speculate about the existence of a Proto-Indo-European myth featuring a fire deity born from water.

Other such mentions include the ninth-century Skaldic poem Ynglingatal, which uses the kenning &quot;sævar niðr&quot; &#x27;kinsman of the sea&#x27; to refer to fire, and an old Armenian poem in which a reed in the middle of the sea spontaneously catches fire, from which springs the hero Vahagn, with fiery hair and eyes that blaze like sun.

===Conjectured original fireless myth===
Whether fire was an original part of Apam Napat&#x27;s nature remains a matter of debate, especially since this connection is absent from the Iranian version. Hermann Oldenberg believed Apam Napat was originally an independent water deity who later came to be associated with Agni, in part because of an ancient Indian belief that water contained fire within itself, fire appearing to &quot;enter into&quot; water when quenched by it.

Associations with Savitr could be understood as similarly deriving from an image of the setting sun sinking into the ocean. Another theory explains the connection between fire and water through lightning, &quot;the flash of fire born from the rainbearing clouds&quot;.

===&#x27;Swamp gas&#x27; conjecture===
Based on the idea that this fire-from-water image was inspired by flaming seepage natural gas, attempts have been made to connect the name &quot;Apam Napat&quot; to the word &quot;&quot;, which passed into Greek – and thence English – from an Iranian language.

However, there is only a modest amount of evidence for a link between the sacred fires of Iranian religion and petroleum or natural gas – although the account of the blowing of the 3 sacred fires out to sea from the back of the ox Srishok where, unquenched, they continue to burn on the water is suggestive – particularly in relation to hydrocarbon deposits in the Southwestern part of the Caspian Sea, exploited currently by the Absheron gas field near Baku in Azerbaijan.

The etymology of the word &quot;naphtha&quot; has been claimed likely to relate to the Akkadian &quot;napṭu&quot;, &quot;petroleum&quot;.

<text>Ringo Lam Ling-Tung (, 8 December 1955 – 29 December 2018) was a Hong Kong film director, producer, and screenwriter. He was known for his action and crime films produced during the Hong Kong New Wave, many of them comprising entries in the heroic bloodshed subgenre. He was nominated for six Hong Kong Film Awards, winning Best Director for his 1987 film &quot;City on Fire&quot;, which he followed with other similar films that shared a dark view of Hong Kong society, collectively known as the &quot;On Fire&quot; cycle.

Lam&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;Aces Go Places IV&quot; (1986), &quot;Prison on Fire&quot; (1987), &quot;Undeclared War&quot; (1990), &quot;Twin Dragons&quot; (1992, co-directed with Tsui Hark), and &quot;Full Contact&quot; (1992). Many of his films starred Chow Yun-fat. He also directed several films in the United States, beginning with 1996&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Risk&quot;, with Jean-Claude Van Damme. He would continue working on film productions in both Hong Kong and two more American productions with Van Damme until 2003.

In 2016, he won the Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award for Best Director for his &quot;Wild City,&quot; his first film in 8 years. His final film, a segment in the omnibus &quot;&quot;, was released posthumously in 2020, two years after his death.

==Early life and background==

Ringo Lam was born in British Hong Kong in 8 December 1955. Lam started his career by enrolling in the TVB Actors Training Program in 1973. At the program, he met Chow Yun Fat with whom he would later collaborate on several films. He graduated from the training program in 1974 alongside Chow. After taking a few acting roles, Lam went to Canada and studied film at York University in Toronto. Lam returned to Hong Kong in 1981.

==Career==

===1980s===
Lam&#x27;s first four films were not written by him. Lam took over as director for Po-Chih Leong after he had finished about one-third of the film &quot;Esprit d&#x27;amour&quot; as the film&#x27;s producer Karl Maka needed a cheap replacement and hired him. Lam explained that he had &quot;no choice, I need food, so I do the best I can ...&quot; Lam received sole directing credit for the film. The film was released on 15 December 1983 in Hong Kong. Lam&#x27;s next feature film was &quot;The Other Side of Gentleman&quot;, which was released 28 June 1984 in Hong Kong. Lam followed this with the romantic comedy film &quot;Cupid One&quot; released 1985. The film grossed HK$6,382,935, which was less than his previous two films which both grossed over ten million Hong Kong dollars. Lam&#x27;s next film was the fourth film in the &quot;Aces Go Places&quot; film series, &quot;Aces Go Places IV&quot;. Lam stated in interviews that he directed the film as a favor to Karl Maka, who helped give Lam his start. The film was very successful at the box office grossing HK$27,012,748 in Hong Kong.

After &quot;Aces Go Places IV&quot;, Karl Maka allowed Lam to make whatever type of film he wanted. Lam&#x27;s had two films released in 1987. one of which was the first of his &quot;On Fire&quot; films, &quot;City on Fire&quot;. The film is a gangster movie which was made in Hong Kong in the footsteps of &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986) which re-invented the gangster film genre in Hong Kong. The film was released on 13 February 1987 and earned $19,723,505 in Hong Kong. Lam won the award for Best Director award at the 1987 Hong Kong Film Awards for &quot;City on Fire&quot;. Lam&#x27;s next film that year was &quot;Prison on Fire&quot; which had a script that was written in nine days while the film was shot in 20 days.

In 1988, along with Karl Maka, Lam had a brief acting role in the film &quot;The Eighth Happiness&quot;. Lam then continued his &quot;On Fire&quot; series with &quot;School on Fire&quot; which was released in Hong Kong on 20 August 1988. &quot;School on Fire&quot; was edited with many scenes censored on its release in both Hong Kong and Taiwan. Lam&#x27;s final film of the 1980s was &quot;Wild Search&quot; released in 1989. It grossed a total of HK$15,944,333 in Hong Kong.

===1990s===
Lam&#x27;s first film of the 1990s was &quot;Undeclared War&quot; released in 1990. The film contained an international cast including Olivia Hussey, Peter Lapis, Danny Lee and Vernon Wells. The film was not as popular as Lam&#x27;s previous films in Hong Kong, grossing HK$5,523,958. Lam&#x27;s next film &quot;Touch and Go&quot; was released on 16 May 1991 in Hong Kong. The film was a comedy starring Sammo Hung. Lam stated in interviews that &quot;Touch and Go&quot; was an assignment took for hire in order to keep himself in the film business. The film grossed less than &quot;Undeclared War&quot; in Hong Kong. Lam released a second film in 1991 titled &quot;Prison on Fire II&quot;. The film was very popular with Hong Kong audiences where it grossed $24,367,261. Lam&#x27;s next film &quot;Twin Dragons&quot; had him partnered with Tsui Hark as a director. According to Hark, Lam handled most of the action scenes in the film. Lam also briefly appears in the film as a car mechanic. Lam&#x27;s next film &quot;Full Contact&quot; was released in Hong Kong on 23 July 1992. It grossed a total of HK$16,793,011. Lam followed it up with &quot;Burning Paradise&quot; which differed from his previous films by being a period film featuring the Chinese folk hero Fong Sai-yuk opposed a film set in an urban environ. The film was poorly received at the box office in Hong Kong, being the 145th highest-grossing film of the year. In 1995, Lam directed another period film set in 1975 starring Andy Lau titled &quot;The Adventurers&quot;. The film was shot partially in the Philippines and the United States and grossed HK$14,839,584 in Hong Kong.

In 1996, Lam made his American debut with the film &quot;Maximum Risk&quot; starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. The film was not a big draw at the box office. Lam returned to Hong Kong where he shot his next film &quot;Full Alert&quot; which was budgeted at $13 million. The film was shown at film festivals in 1997 including Rotterdam and Berlin. &quot;Full Alert&quot; was nominated for five awards at the Hong Kong Film Awards and won the award for best film and best actor (Lau Ching-wan) at the Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards. Lam followed up &quot;Full Alert&quot; the next year with &quot;The Suspect&quot; which was shot in the Philippines. &quot;The Suspect&quot; was not as financially successful as &quot;Full Alert&quot;, grossing around ten million less. In 1998, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Lam would direct the film &quot;Simon Sez&quot; with Kevin Elders. Lam later only contributed to the film as a producer. Lam directed a Hong Kong production titled &quot;Victim&quot;. The film featured a supernatural storyline and had its ending changed on its Hong Kong theatrical release. Half of the release prints contained a scene stating whether or not the actor was possessed by a ghost. The other half of the movie reflected the original script and did not reveal this.

===21st century===

Lam&#x27;s second U.S.-based production, &quot;Replicant&quot;, was released in 2001. The film was screened theatrically in France on 11 July 2001. The film was released direct-to-video in the United States. Lam directed two more films in 2003: the Hong Kong production &quot;Looking for Mister Perfect&quot; and the American direct-to-video release &quot;In Hell&quot; starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Lam next took a break from filmmaking after finding dissatisfaction with the filming environment in Hong Kong after &quot;Finding Mr. Perfect&quot; did poorly in the box office. Lam also stated that he wanted to spend more time with his family and &quot;above all, to observe people and learn more about them. I wanted to seek resources, material, and subjects that were worth making into films.&quot;

In 2007, Lam co-directed a section of the portmanteau film &quot;Triangle&quot; with Tsui Hark and Johnnie To. Lam stated that his story in the film represented &quot;a metaphor of my attitude towards filmmaking: It is always a love-hate process.&quot; The film was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 2014, the Hong Kong newspaper &quot;Apple Daily&quot; reported that Lam would return to directing with a film with funding from Mei Ah Entertainment with a cast to include Daniel Wu and Shawn Yue. The film began production in June 2014. The film marked Lam&#x27;s first feature-length film in over a decade Lam&#x27;s new film was titled &quot;Wild City&quot;. Lam stated that he returned to filming after his son had graduated from college and that he would &quot;like to make films that allow me to express myself. It&#x27;s a device for me to unburden myself, to get things off my chest, and also a mirror to learn more about myself through the film I made. I don&#x27;t make films for money anymore.&quot; Lam attended the New York Asian Film Festival in 2015 where he was a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award.

Lam&#x27;s last film, &quot;Sky on Fire&quot;, was released in 2016; it is the last installment in his &quot;On Fire&quot; series.

On 29 December 2018, Lam was confirmed dead at his Hong Kong residence at age 63, after his wife found him unresponsive in his bed. Lam had been working on a film &quot;Eight and a Half&quot; with Milkyway Image with Ann Hui, John Woo, Tsui Hark, Patrick Tam, Johnnie To, Sammo Hung and Yuen Woo-Ping. Each director was to create a segment based on Hong Kong history. Without Woo&#x27;s segment, the film&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;&quot; and the film was originally set for a release at the 2020 Cannes Film Festival. The film was screened at the Busan International Film Festival on 21 October 2020.

==Style==
Lam&#x27;s first four films were comedies not written by Lam. When Lam began to shoot the films he wanted to make after the success of &quot;Aces Go Places IV&quot;, he began his &quot;On Fire&quot; series. Lam chose the English titles for these films stating that it gave them &quot;a sense of energy, of action&quot;. The films &quot;City on Fire&quot;, &quot;Prison on Fire&quot; and &quot;School on Fire&quot; do not share any characters or situations, but all have a common bleak view on Hong Kong society. In these films, Lam looks at controversial issues such as street violence and the abuse of street, prison and school systems.

Lam rarely employed Cantopop in his films. Lam&#x27;s films often have Western music, such as &quot;City on Fire&quot;, which features a blues-oriented saxophone score, and &quot;Full Contact&quot;, which uses American rock music.

<text>Aranyani () is the goddess of forests and the wild animals that dwell within them in Hinduism.

== Literature ==

Aranyani has the distinction of having one of the most descriptive hymns in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; dedicated to her. The Aranyani Suktam (Hymn 146 in the 10th mandala of the Rigveda) describes her as being elusive, fond of quiet glades in the jungle, and fearless of remote places. In the hymn, the supplicant entreats her to explain how she wanders so far from the fringe of civilisation without becoming afraid or lonely. She wears anklets with bells, and though seldom seen, she can be heard by the tinkling of her anklets. She is also described as a dancer. Her ability to feed both man and animals though she &#x27;tills no lands&#x27; is what the supplicant finds most marvellous. The hymn is repeated in Taittiriya Brahmana and interpreted by the commentator of that work.

Aranyani bears resemblance to latter day forest deities like Banbibi in West Bengal, Vanadevata in Goa and Konkan region, Vanadurga in parts of South India. Her worship has declined in modern-day Hinduism, and it is rare to find a temple dedicated to Aranyani. However, there is one in Arrah, Bihar known as the Aranya Devi Temple.

She is sometimes regarded to be the owner of Kalpavriksha, the divine tree.

Samuel &quot;Sammo&quot; Hung Kam-bo (; born 7 January 1952) is a Hong Kong actor, martial artist, film producer and director, known for his work in martial arts films, Hong Kong action cinema, and as a fight choreographer for other actors such as Kim Tai-chung, Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, and Yuen Wah.

Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and popularized the zombie-like jiangshi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew.

Both Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan were often addressed as &quot;Dai Goh&quot;, meaning &quot;Big Brother&quot;, until the filming of &quot;Project A&quot; (1983), which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu &quot;brothers&quot;, and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname &quot;Dai Goh Dai&quot;, meaning &quot;Big, Big Brother&quot;, or &quot;Biggest Big Brother&quot;.

==Early years==
Born in Hong Kong, both of his parents worked as wardrobe artists in the local film industry and guardianship was thrust upon his grandparents. His grandmother was archetypal martial art actress Chin Tsi-ang and his grandfather was film director Hung Chung-ho.

Hung joined the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School in Hong Kong, in 1961. He was enrolled for a period of seven years, beginning at the age of 9, after his grandparents heard about the school from their friends. The opera school was run by Master Yu Jim Yuen and as was customary for all students, Hung adopted the given name of his sifu as his family name whilst attending. Going by the name Yuen Lung (元龍), Hung became the foremost member of the Seven Little Fortunes (七小福) performing group, and would establish a friendly rivalry with one of the younger students, &quot;Yuen Lo&quot;. Yuen Lo would go on to become international superstar Jackie Chan.
At the age of 14, Hung was selected by a teacher who had connections to the Hong Kong film industry to perform stunts on a movie. This brief foray into the industry piqued his interest in film and he took particular interest in the operation of film cameras. As the eldest of the troupe, Hung would give his opera school brothers pocket money from his earnings, endearing him greatly to his young friends. Shortly before leaving the Academy at the age of 16, Hung suffered an injury that left him bedridden for an extended period, during which time his weight ballooned. After finding work in the film industry as a stuntman, he was given a nickname after a well-known Chinese cartoon character, Sam-mo (三毛; Three Hairs).

Many years later, in 1988, Hung starred in Alex Law&#x27;s &quot;Painted Faces&quot;, a dramatic re-telling of his experiences at the &quot;China Drama Academy&quot;. Among the exercises featured in the film are numerous acrobatic backflips, and hours of handstands performed against a wall. Despite some of the more brutal exercises and physical punishments shown in &quot;Painted Faces&quot;, Hung and the rest of the Seven Little Fortunes consider the film a toned-down version of their actual experiences.

==Film career==

===1960s and 1970s===
Hung appeared as a child actor in several films for Cathay Asia and Bo Bo Films during the early 1960s. His film debut was in the 1961 film &quot;Education of Love&quot;. In 1962, he made his first appearance alongside Jackie Chan in the film &quot;Big and Little Wong Tin Bar&quot;, followed by a role in &quot;The Birth of Yue Fei&quot;, in which he played the ten-year-old Yue Fei, the historical figure from the Song Dynasty who would go on to become a famous Chinese general and martyr. The majority of Hung&#x27;s performance was alongside another actor portraying Zhou Tong, Yue&#x27;s elderly military arts tutor.
In 1966, at the age of just 14, Hung began working for Shaw Brothers Studio, assisting the action director Han Yingjie, on King Hu&#x27;s film &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot; thanks to the fact that Han was his master&#x27;s son-in-law. Between 1966 and 1974, Hung worked on dozens of films for Shaw Brothers, their two main rivals Golden Harvest and Cathay, as well as numerous independent production companies, progressing through the roles of extra, stuntman, stunt co-ordinator and ultimately, action director.

In 1970, Hung began working for Raymond Chow and the Golden Harvest film company. He was initially hired to assist Han Yingjie in choreographing the action scenes for the very first two Golden Harvest films, &quot;The Invincible Eight&quot; and &quot;The Angry River&quot;. Golden Harvest sent Hung to Korea to choreograph films with their director Huang Feng where Hung studied hapkido with Master Ji Han-Jae and earned his black belt. While in Korea he became the martial arts director on three Angela Mao vehicles, &quot;Lady Whirlwind&quot;, &quot;Hapkido&quot;, and &quot;When Taekwondo Strikes&quot;. His popularity soon began to grow, and due to the quality of his choreography and disciplined approach to his work, he again caught the eye of celebrated Taiwanese director, King Hu. Hung choreographed Hu&#x27;s &quot;The Fate of Lee Khan&quot; (1973).

Also in 1973, he was seen in the Bruce Lee classic &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. Hung was the Shaolin student Lee faces in the opening sequence. In 1975, Hung choreographed the action for &quot;The Man from Hong Kong&quot;, the first Australian co-production undertaken by Golden Harvest.

In the mid-70s, martial arts movies began to lose some of their punch at the box office and Golden Harvest signed the Hui Brothers to a contract. Michael, Ricky, and Sam Hui had been at Shaw Brothers but wanted to direct their own movies. When Shaw refused they signed with Golden Harvest and their blockbuster comedies kicked off a comedy wave in Hong Kong. When it came time to direct his first film, &quot;The Iron Fisted Monk&quot; (1977), Hung made sure to lean into the comedy, delivering what many feel to be the first out-and-out kung fu comedy film.

In 1978, Raymond Chow gave Hung the task of completing the fight co-ordination for the re-shoot of &quot;Game of Death&quot;, the film Bruce Lee was unable to complete before his death in 1973.

In 1978, Hung directed his second film, the comedy &quot;Enter the Fat Dragon&quot;, for H.K. Fong Ming Motion Picture Company, also playing the lead role Ah Lung; a character who idolises and impersonates Bruce Lee. Hung has impersonated Lee on film twice more - in the final fight scene against Cynthia Rothrock in &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Express&quot; (1986), and throughout the 1990 Lau Kar-wing film &quot;Skinny Tiger, Fatty Dragon&quot;.

After Jackie Chan&#x27;s success with &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (1978), Hung was scheduled to make a similar film featuring &quot;Drunken Master&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Beggar So&quot; character played by Yuen Siu Tien (aka Simon Yuen). As his elder, Sammo&#x27;s films were expected to surpass Chan&#x27;s in popularity. The film was &quot;The Magnificent Butcher&quot; (1979), which Hung co-directed with Yuen Woo-ping. However, during filming Yuen Siu Tien died of a heart attack. He was replaced by Fan Mei Sheng and Yuen&#x27;s absence may have led to low ticket sales.

===1980s===
As Hung&#x27;s fame grew, he used his newly found influence to assist his former China Drama Academy classmates, as well as the former students of &quot;rival&quot; school The Spring and Autumn Drama School. Aside from regular collaborations with Chan, others such as Yuen Biao, Yuen Wah, Lam Ching-ying and Mang Hoi also began to make regular appearances in his films.

In 1978 and 1981, Hung made two films that contain fine examples of the Wing Chun style. The first, &quot;Warriors Two&quot;, was the most significant role to date for South Korean super kicker Casanova Wong, who teamed up with Hung in the final fight. The second film was &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, in which the Wing Chun fighting was performed by Lam Ching-Ying. The release of &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, along with another film directed by and co-starring Hung, &quot;Knockabout&quot; (1979), also elevated his fellow Opera schoolmate Yuen Biao to stardom.

Hung&#x27;s martial arts films of the 1980s helped reconfigure how martial arts were presented on screen. While the martial arts films of the 1970s generally featured highly stylised fighting sequences in period or fantasy settings, Hung&#x27;s choreography, set in modern urban areas, was more realistic and frenetic - featuring long one-on-one fight scenes. The fight sequences from several of these films, such as those in &quot;Winners and Sinners&quot; (1982) and &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1985) came to define 1980s martial arts movies.

In 1983, the collaboration between the triumvirate of Hung, Jackie Chan, and Yuen Biao began with Chan&#x27;s &quot;Project A&quot;. Hung, Chan and Yuen were known as the &#x27;Three Dragons&#x27; and their alliance lasted for 5 years. Although Yuen continued to appear in the films of Hung and Chan, the final film to date starring all three was 1988&#x27;s &quot;Dragons Forever&quot;.

Hung was also responsible for the &quot;Lucky Stars&quot; comedy film series in the 1980s. He directed and co-starred in the original trilogy, &quot;Winners and Sinners&quot; (1983), &quot;My Lucky Stars&quot; (1985) and &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars&quot; (1985). These first three films featured Chan and Biao in supporting roles. Hung also produced and played a supporting role in the fourth film, &quot;Lucky Stars Go Places&quot; (1986), and made a cameo appearance in the sixth and final film, &quot;How to Meet the Lucky Stars&quot; (1996).

During the 1980s, Hung was instrumental in popularizing the &quot;jiangshi&quot; genre. Jiangshi are reanimated corpses which can only move by hopping due to the onset of rigor mortis, a Chinese equivalent to Western vampires. Two landmark films, &quot;Encounters of the Spooky Kind&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Dead and the Deadly&quot; (1983), featured jiangshi who move by hopping towards their victims, as well as Taoist priests with the ability to control these vampires (and at times, each other) through magical spells and charms. Hung&#x27;s jiangshi films would pave the way for films such as the popular &quot;Mr. Vampire&quot; (1985), which he also produced, and its sequels. He revitalised the subgenre of female-led martial art films, producing cop films such as &quot;Yes, Madam&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Police Assassins&quot; (1985), which introduced stars Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock.

===1990s===

====Film====
After some relatively poor performances at the domestic box-office, Hung had a dispute with studio head, Raymond Chow. Hung had produced the thriller &quot;Into the Fire&quot; (1989), but Hung felt Golden Harvest had withdrawn the film from cinemas too soon. The disagreement led to Hung parting company with Golden Harvest in 1991, after 21 years with the company.

Whilst continuing to produce films through his own company Bojon Films Company Ltd, Hung failed to equal his early successes. His fortunes improved somewhat as the helmer of &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot; (1997), a long-awaited reunion with Chan.

In 1994, Hung coordinated the fight sequences in Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s wuxia epic, &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;.

====Television====
In 1998, US television network CBS began to broadcast &quot;Martial Law&quot; (1998–2000) on Saturday nights, an action-drama built around Hung. The hour-long shows were a surprise success and installed Hung as the only East Asian headlining a prime time network series. The television series was executive produced and occasionally directed by Stanley Tong, and co-starred Arsenio Hall. Hung reportedly recited some of his English dialogue phonetically.

===2000s===

====Film====
During 2000–2001, Hung expressed interest in creating a film adaptation of the video game &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;. The production agreement for the film was made around April 2001 with an estimated budget of $50 million. Hung had the idea of producing a martial arts epic with Chen Lung Jackie Chan in the lead role, but the film was never made. Hung&#x27;s plans were detailed on his website, but after a year the announcement was removed. The film rights have since been acquired by Warren Zide, the producer of &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;Final Destination&quot;. No film ever materialized.

Hung found renewed success in the Hong Kong film industry in the 2000s, beginning with &quot;The Legend of Zu&quot; (2001), the long-awaited sequel to the 1983 hit &quot;Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain&quot;. In 2004, Stephen Chow&#x27;s &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot; was released. Though Yuen Woo-ping was credited for the martial arts choreography on &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot;, Hung actually did the preliminary work but left the film midway through, and Yuen filled in to complete it. Because of his departure from the film, there was tabloid speculation that he and Chow had strong differences over the film, resulting in their separation. Chow has since responded that Hung left for personal reasons and not because of speculated tensions. In 2004, Hung again worked with Jackie Chan, in a brief but notable appearance in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; as the legendary folk hero Wong Fei Hung, a character played by Chan in the &quot;Drunken Master&quot; series.

In 2005, Hung was involved in Daniel Lee&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Squad&quot; and Wilson Yip&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (aka &quot;Kill Zone&quot;). In the latter, Hung played a villain for the first time in over 25 years, and had his first ever fight scene against Donnie Yen. One of the key relationships in &quot;SPL&quot; had been Hung&#x27;s role as the adoptive father of Wu Jing&#x27;s character. However, these scenes were dropped from the final film as the director couldn&#x27;t find a way to fit them into the film. In response to this, a prequel film was planned. Hung appeared alongside Wu Jing again in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Twins Mission&quot; with stars, the Twins. In early 2008, Hung starred in &quot;Fatal Move&quot;, in which he and Ken Lo played a pair of rival triad gang leaders. He also starred in, and performed action choreography for, Daniel Lee&#x27;s &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot;, with Andy Lau and Maggie Q. The film, was based on the book &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

Antony Szeto&#x27;s film, &quot;Wushu&quot;, which stars Hung premiered in Beijing in October 2008. The film was unveiled by Golden Network at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. Jackie Chan was the film&#x27;s executive producer, and worked on the film in an advisory capacity, assisting with marketing and casting. Hung then worked again with director Wilson Yip and star Donnie Yen, as the action director for the 2008 film &quot;Ip Man&quot;.

In 2010, Hung was given a lifetime achievement award at the New York Asian Film Festival, where four of his films were shown. That year Hung appeared in &quot;Ip Man 2&quot;, which he also choreographed. His role is that of a Hung Gar master who challenges Ip Man. In the same year, Hung appeared in the movie &quot;The Legend Is Born: Ip Man&quot; as well. He acts as Chan Wah-shun, the martial arts teacher of Ip Man.

The annual and highly anticipated Hong Kong International Film Festival was held for its 45th edition in April 2021. Hung is one of the six veteran Hong Kong filmmakers who directed renowned local director Johnnie To Kei-fung&#x27;s highly anticipated anthology series : &quot;&quot; (2022). The other filmmakers include Ringo Lam, Ann Hui On-wah, Patrick Tam Kar Ming, Tsui Hark, Yuen Woo-ping and Johnnie To. The short files were shot entirely on 35mm film with each of them touches on a nostalgic and moving story set across different time periods, with every one acting as an ode to the city.

====Television====
In between films and special appearances, Hung has appeared in several East Asian television series. In 2003, he was in mainland Chinese TV film series &quot;Dragon Laws&quot; with Fan Bingbing, followed by &quot;The Valley of Lost Vengeance&quot; (aka &quot;End Enmity Hollow&quot;). More recently, he played a master con-artist in the Taiwanese series &quot;Coming Lies&quot; and Wing Chun master Wong Wah-bo in &quot;Wing Chun&quot;, reprising the role he played in &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; over 20 years earlier. He co-starred in the series alongside Yuen Biao, Nicholas Tse and his youngest son, Sammy Hung.

Hung appeared as a guest judge on the China Beijing TV Station reality television series &quot;The Disciple&quot;, which aired in mainland China and was produced by, and featured, Jackie Chan. The aim of the program was to find a new star, skilled in acting and martial arts, to become Chan&#x27;s &quot;successor&quot;, the champion being awarded the lead role in a film. It concluded on 7 June 2008, with the series winner announced in Beijing.

In another mainland Chinese television series, &quot;The Shaolin Warriors&quot;, set during the Ming Dynasty, Hung played Big Foot, a Shaolin warrior monk joining General Qi Jiguang&#x27;s marines to help defend the nation against Japanese pirates. Sammy Hung also has a role, as Big Foot&#x27;s disciple.

==Filmography==
Hung has starred in 75 films, and worked on over 230, beginning as a child actor whilst still attending the China Drama Academy. Upon leaving the opera school, he worked as an extra and stuntman, and progressed through other roles including fight choreographer, stunt co-ordinator, action director, actor, writer, producer and director.

Most recently, Hung has starred in the 2017 historic action film &quot;God of War&quot;.

==Film production==

===Gar Bo Motion Picture Company===
In 1978 Sammo Hung formed Gar Bo Motion Picture Company, a subsidiary of Golden Harvest, with director Karl Maka and former actor-choreographer Lau Kar Wing (brother of actors Lau Kar-leung and Gordon Liu). The company&#x27;s name consists of the &quot;Gar&quot; sound from Lau Kar Wing and Karl Maka (Mak Kar), and &quot;Bo&quot; from Hung Kam Bo.). The company disbanded in 1980, when Maka moved on to form Cinema City &amp; Films Co. with Raymond Wong and Dean Shek. Gar Bo released two films, both starring Hung and Lau:

* &quot;Dirty Tiger, Crazy Frog&quot; (1978)
* &quot;Odd Couple&quot; (1979)

===Bo Ho Film Company Ltd.===
1980 saw Raymond Chow pull one of Hung&#x27;s films from local cinemas after just two weeks. Hung responded by starting his own production company, Bo Ho Film Company Ltd., allowing him to have greater control in producing Hong Kong films. While Bo Ho produced, Golden Harvest still operated as distributors. In all, 44 films were released by Bo Ho, several of which starred Hung:

===D&amp;B Films Company Ltd===
In 1983, Hung co-founded another production company, D&amp;B Films Company Ltd (&quot;D&amp;B&quot; being short for &quot;Duk-Bo&quot;), with Dickson Poon and John Shum. The company operated until 1992 and produced a total of 68 Hong Kong films:

==Personal life==
* Hung&#x27;s grandmother was martial-arts actress Chin Tsi-ang who starred in almost 80 films between 1941 and 2002. His grandfather, a film director and writer, Hung Chung Ho, directed over 40 films between 1937 and 1950.
* Hung&#x27;s younger brother, Lee Chi-kit, has worked on almost 40 films, many of which Hung was also involved with. Lee also worked on Hung&#x27;s &quot;Martial Law&quot; series. He works primarily as a supporting actor and action director.
* In 1973, he married Jo Eun-ok (曹恩玉). Jo was his girlfriend whom he met during filming in Korea and later became his female assistant. They have three sons, Tin-Ming &quot;Timmy&quot; Hung (洪天明; born 1974), Tin Cheung &quot;Jimmy&quot; Hung (洪天祥; born 1977), Tin Chiu &quot;Sammy&quot; Hung (洪天照; born 1979), and a daughter, Chan Yu &quot;Stephanie&quot; Hung (洪煦榆; born 1983) with her. Hung divorced Jo in 1994. Hung admitted that the reason for this was that he often cheated on her and caused them to fight every day.
*He married model and actress Joyce Godenzi in 1995. Godenzi appeared in several of his films including &quot;Eastern Condors&quot; (1986), &quot;Spooky, Spooky&quot; (1988), &quot;Paper Marriage&quot; (1988) and &quot;She Shoots Straight&quot; (1990) prior to the pair becoming a couple.

* Sammy Hung appeared as the nemesis to Nicholas Tse&#x27;s character in the 2007 television series &quot;Wing Chun&quot;, a remake of the original series broadcast in 1994, and the subsequent film &quot;Wing Chun&quot;. The series also starred Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. Sammy also appeared alongside his father in the film Choy Lee Fut.
* Hung is one of the celebrities honoured on the Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong.
* Hung is known for his large frame. Despite this, he is a surprisingly agile and formidable martial artist.
* He has a circular scar on the right side of his face, just above his lip. In the early days of his film career, Hung was involved in a street fight outside a Kowloon nightclub, and was stabbed with a broken cola bottle.
* On 5 August 2009, Hung became ill during the filming of &quot;Ip Man 2&quot; in the Guangdong province of Foshan. He was admitted to hospital and underwent a heart surgery operation. He was discharged and returned to work within days. He cited a combination of his weight, his love of cigars and long filming hours resulting in fatigue and irregular meals as the cause.

==In popular culture==
* A pop band from Wales named themselves Sammo Hung after the actor.
* Master Elehung Kinpo, from &quot;Juken Sentai Gekiranger&quot;, is named after him. Coincidentally, Yū Mizushima, the voice actor for Elehung Kinpo, did the dubbing for Sammo Hung.

<doc id="100383" wikidata="Q166276" url="?curid=100383" title="Madrid–Barajas Airport">
<text>Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport is the main international airport serving Madrid, the capital city of Spain. At in area, it is the second-largest airport in Europe by physical size behind Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. In 2019, 61.8 million passengers travelled through Madrid–Barajas, making it the country&#x27;s busiest airport as well as Europe&#x27;s fifth-busiest.

The airport opened in 1931 and has grown to be one of Europe&#x27;s most important aviation centres. Within the city limits of Madrid, it is from the city&#x27;s financial district and northeast of the Puerta del Sol or Plaza Mayor de Madrid, Madrid&#x27;s historic centre. The airport name derives from the adjacent district of Barajas, which has its own metro station on the same rail line serving the airport. Barajas serves as the gateway to the Iberian peninsula from the rest of Europe and the world and is a key link between Europe and Latin America. Following the death of the first Spanish Prime Minister after Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, Adolfo Suárez, in 2014, the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Transport announced that the airport was to be renamed &quot;Aeropuerto Adolfo Suárez, Madrid–Barajas&quot;. The airport is the primary hub and maintenance base for Iberia and Air Europa. Consequently, Iberia is responsible for more than 40% of Barajas&#x27;s traffic. The airport has five passenger terminals: T1, T2, T3, T4 and T4S.

==History==
===Early years===

The airport was constructed in 1927, opening to domestic and international air traffic on 22 April 1931, although regular commercial operations began two years later. A small terminal was constructed with a capacity for 30,000 passengers a year, in addition to several hangars and the building of the Avión Club. The first regular flight was established by Lineas Aéreas Postales Españolas (LAPE) with its route to Barcelona. In the 1930s, flights started to serve some European and African destinations, the first international flights from the airport.

Originally, the flight field was a large circle bordered in white with the name of Madrid in its interior, unpaved, consisting of land covered with natural grass. It was not until the 1940s that the flight field was paved and new runways were designed. The first runway which started operation in 1944 was 1,400 metres long and 45 metres wide. By the end of the decade the airport had three runways, none of which exist today. In the late 1940s, scheduled flights to Latin America and the Philippines started.

In the 1950s, the airport supported over half a million passengers, increasing to five runways and scheduled flights to New York City began. The National Terminal, currently T2, began construction in 1954 and opened later that year. In the Plan of Airports of 1957, Barajas Airport is classified as a first-class international airport. By the 1970s, large jets were landing at Barajas, and the growth of traffic mainly as a result of tourism exceeded forecasts. At the beginning of the decade, the airport reached the 1.2 million passengers, double that envisaged in the Plan of Airports of 1957.

In the 1970s, with the boom in tourism and the arrival of the Boeing 747, the airport reached 4 million passengers and began the construction of the international terminal (current T1). In 1974, Iberia, L.A.E. introduced the shuttle service between Madrid and Barcelona, a service with multiple daily frequencies and available without prior reservation.

The 1982 FIFA World Cup brought significant expansion and modernisation of the airport&#x27;s two existing terminals.

In the 1990s, the airport expanded further. In 1994, the first cargo terminal was constructed and the control tower was renovated. In 1997, it opened the North Dock, which is used as an exclusive terminal for Iberia&#x27;s Schengen flights. In 1998, it inaugurated a new control tower, 71 m tall and then in 1999 the new South Dock opened, which implies an expansion of the international terminal. During this time, the distribution of the terminals changed: The south dock and most of the International Terminal were now called T1, the rest of the International Terminal and Domestic Terminal were now called T2 and the north dock was called T3.

In November 1998, the new runway 18R-36L started operations (replacing the previous 18–36), 4,400 m long, one of the largest in Europe under expansion plans called Major Barajas. In 2000, it began the construction of new terminals T4 and its satellite, T4S, designed by architects Antonio Lamela, Richard Rogers and Luis Vidal. Two parallel runways to the existing ones were also built.

===Development since the 2000s===
The new terminals and runways were completed in 2004, but were not in service until 5 February 2006.

Terminal 4, designed by Antonio Lamela, Richard Rogers and Luis Vidal, (winning team of the 2006 Stirling Prize) and TPS Engineers, (winning team of the 2006 IStructE Award for Commercial Structures) was built by Ferrovial and inaugurated on 5 February 2006. Terminal 4 is one of the world&#x27;s largest airport terminals in terms of area, with 760,000 square meters (8,180,572 square feet) in separate landside and airside structures. It consists of a main building, T4 (470,000 m2) and a satellite building, T4S (290,000 m2), which are approximately 2 km apart. The new Terminal 4 is designed to give passengers a stress-free start to their journey. This is managed through careful use of illumination, with glass panes instead of walls and numerous skylights which allow natural light into the structure. With this new addition, Barajas is designed to handle 70 million passengers annually.

During the construction of Terminal 4, two more runways (15L/33R and 18L/36R) were constructed to aid in the flow of air traffic arriving and departing from Barajas. These runways were officially inaugurated on 5 February 2006 (together with the terminals), but had already been used on several occasions beforehand to test flight and air traffic manoeuvres. Thus, Barajas came to have four runways: two on a north–south axis and parallel to each other (separated by 1.3 km) and two on a northwest–southeast axis (and separated by 1.9 km). This allowed simultaneous takeoffs and landings into the airport, allowing 120 operations an hour (one takeoff or landing every 30 seconds).

Terminals 1, 2 and 3 are adjacent terminals that are home to SkyTeam and Star Alliance airlines. Terminal 4 is home to Iberia, its franchise Air Nostrum and all Oneworld partner airlines. Gate numbers are continuous in terminals 1, 2 and 3 (A1 to E89), but are separately numbered in terminal 4 (H, J, K and M, R, S, U in satellite building).

The Madrid–Barcelona air shuttle service, known as the &quot;Puente Aéreo&quot; (in Spanish), literally called &quot;Air Bridge&quot;, used to be the busiest route between two EU airports with 55 daily flights in 2012. The schedule has been reduced since the February 2008 opening of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line which covers the distance in hours. Subsequently, the route has been overtaken by London-Dublin and Paris-Toulouse.

On the morning of 30 December 2006, an explosion took place in the carpark building module D attached to Terminal 4. Authorities received a bomb threat at approximately 8:15 local time (7:15 GMT), with the caller stating that a car bomb carried with 800 kg of explosive would explode at 9:00 local time (8:00 GMT). After receiving the warning, police were able to evacuate part of the airport. Later, an anonymous caller stated that ETA claims responsibility for the bombing. As a result of the explosion, two Ecuadorians who were sleeping in their cars died. The whole module D of the car park was levelled creating around 40,000 tonnes of debris. It took workers six days to recover the body of the second victim from the rubble.
In 2007, the airport processed more than 52 million passengers. Barajas was voted &quot;Best Airport&quot; in the 2008 &quot;Condé Nast Traveller Reader Awards&quot;.

In December 2010, the Spanish government announced plans to tender Madrid–Barajas airport to companies in the private sector for a period of up to 40 years.

On 27 January 2012, Spanair suspended all flights affecting Madrid–Barajas as well as other domestic and international connections. On 20 September 2012, both runways 15/33 were renamed as 14R/32L (the longest) and 14L/32R (the shortest).

On 1 August 2015, the first scheduled Airbus A380 flight landed in Madrid-Barajas in a daily service to Dubai by Emirates.

Following the death of former Spanish Prime Minister, Adolfo Suárez, in 2014, the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Transport announced that the airport would be renamed &quot;Aeropuerto Adolfo Suárez, Madrid–Barajas&quot;. This renaming seeks recognition for Suárez&#x27;s role as the first Prime Minister of Spain after the restoration of democracy and his key participation in the transition to democracy after the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

In late 2018 and early 2019, Iberia renovated its two lounges in Terminal 4, the Dali and Velazquez lounges.

In December 2019, the airport&#x27;s operator Aena announced plans to significantly expand and renovate the existing installations, increasing their yearly capacity from 70 to 80 million passengers and bridging the architectural gap between the original Terminals 1, 2 and 3 and the newer Terminal 4. The project has a budget of 750 million Euro and is set to be executed in the period from 2022 to 2026.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

The following airlines serve regular scheduled flights to and from Madrid:

===Busiest routes===


== Medical care ==
The airport is attached to the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital in Madrid as a referral hospital for medical and surgical emergencies requiring hospital care.

In addition, the airport itself has medical rooms and medical personnel attached to the Airport Medical Service to cover transit passengers who need medical attention. It also has 75 Cardiac Rescue Points equipped with defibrillators in the event of cardiorespiratory arrest.

==Ground transport==
===Taxi===
All terminals have clearly signed taxi ranks outside the arrivals area. Official taxis are white with a red stripe and have the Madrid City Council coat-of-arms on their doors.

===Ride-hailing===
Since 2024, the Estonian ride-hailing company Bolt has operated exclusive pickup areas at the airport, offering flat-rate fares for rides into the city.

===Rail===
The Madrid Metro Line connects the airport with city centre station Nuevos Ministerios in Madrid&#x27;s financial district. The Barajas Line 8 provides a fast route from the underground stations at Terminal 2 (access to T1 and T3) and Terminal 4 into central Madrid. The metro also provides links to stations on the Spanish railway network.

In October 2006, a bid was launched for the construction of a Cercanías link between Chamartín Station and Terminal 4. Now finished, this single Cercanías Line (C-1) links Madrid Barajas Terminal 4, with Chamartín Station and Atocha AVE high-speed train stations. In June 2011 a decision was made to equip this link with dual gauge which will allow AVE high-speed trains to reach the airport station.

The Nuevos Ministerios metro station opened a satellite check-in center in 2002 right by the AZCA business area in central Madrid; the satellite check-in center was permanently closed in 2006 due to security concerns.

EMT (Madrid Municipal Transport Company) runs regular public bus services between the airport and Madrid (Avenida de América station): bus 200 runs as a complete line – dropping passengers at departures of terminals 1, 2 and 4 before collecting passengers in the reverse order at arrivals. The EMT public night bus service N4 (nicknamed &quot;Buho&quot;, Owl) also services from Madrid downtown (Plaza Cibeles) to Barajas (Plaza de los Hermanos Falcó y Alvarez de Toledo, 400m from the airport through a passageway above the highway). EMT also have an express bus linking Barajas airport to Renfe&#x27;s Atocha Station, the main rail station in Madrid, during day and Plaza Cibeles during night. Unlike the two services mentioned above, this line runs 24 hours of the day during all the days of the year.

CRTM (Consorcio Regional de Transportes de Madrid) runs four bus services between the airport and nearby cities in the metropolitan area:

* 822: T1 – Coslada – San Fernando de Henares
* 824: T2 – Torrejón de Ardoz – Alcalá de Henares
* 827: Canillejas – T4 – Alcobendas – Universidad Autónoma de Madrid – Tres Cantos
* 828: Canillejas – T4 – Alcobendas – Universidad Autónoma de Madrid

===Long distance coaches===
From terminals T1 and T4 the bus company Avanzabus operates routes to Ávila, Castellón, Salamanca, Valencia and Zamora. From terminal T4 the Alsa bus company runs services to the cities of Zaragoza, Barcelona, Valladolid, León, Murcia, Alicante, Gijón, Oviedo, Lugo, Coruña, Santiago de Compostela, Burgos, Vitoria, San Sebastián, Santander, Bilbao, Logroño and Pamplona. From terminal T1 the Socibus company runs services to the major cities in Andalusia: Huelva, Córdoba, Cadiz, Jerez and Seville.

=== Airport People Mover ===
In early 2006, the first driverless transit system in Spain and the longest airport people mover system in Europe began transporting passengers between the new terminal (T4) and a new satellite terminal (T4S). Deploying the CITYFLO 550 automatic train control technology, the system is the only mode of transportation for passengers between the two terminals, which are spaced two kilometres apart. Bombardier became the only contractor for the completely underground shuttle system, including the construction of the civil works, operation and maintenance of the system.

The route is in length and can carry up to 13,000 passengers per hour.

===Airport parking===
Long- and short-term car parking is provided at the airport with seven public parking areas. P1 is an outdoor car park located in front of the terminal building; P2 is an indoor car park with direct access to terminals T2 and T3. A Parking &#x27;Express&#x27; facility, available for short periods only, is located at Terminal 2 and dedicated long-term parking is also available with 1,655 spaces; a free shuttle operates between the long-stay car park and all terminals. There are also VIP car parks.

<doc id="100384" wikidata="Q154952" url="?curid=100384" title="Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands">
<text>Willem-Alexander (; Willem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand; born 27 April 1967) is King of the Netherlands, reigning since 30 April 2013.

Willem-Alexander was born in Utrecht during the reign of his maternal grandmother, Queen Juliana, as the eldest child of Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus. He became Prince of Orange as heir apparent upon his mother&#x27;s accession on 30 April 1980. He went to public primary and secondary schools in the Netherlands, and an international sixth-form college in Wales. He served in the Royal Netherlands Navy, and studied history at Leiden University. He married Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti in 2002, and they have three daughters: Catharina-Amalia, Alexia, and Ariane. Willem-Alexander succeeded his mother as monarch upon her abdication on 30 April 2013. He is the first man to hold this position since the death of his great-great-grandfather William III in 1890, as the intervening three monarchs—his great-grandmother Wilhelmina, his grandmother Juliana and his mother Beatrix—had all been women.

Willem-Alexander is interested in sports and international water management issues. Until his accession to the throne, he was a member of the International Olympic Committee (1998–2013), chairman of the Advisory Committee on Water to the Dutch Minister of Infrastructure and the Environment (2004–2013), and chairman of the Secretary-General of the United Nations&#x27; Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation (2006–2013).

==Early life and education==

Willem-Alexander was born on 27 April 1967 at Academic Hospital Utrecht (now known as the University Medical Center Utrecht) in Utrecht. He is the first child of Princess Beatrix (later Queen) and Prince Claus, and the first grandchild of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard. He was the first male Dutch royal baby since the birth of Prince Alexander in 1851, and the first immediate male heir since Alexander&#x27;s death in 1884.

From birth, Willem-Alexander has held the titles Prince of the Netherlands (), Prince of Orange-Nassau, and Jonkheer of Amsberg. He was baptised as a member of the Dutch Reformed Church on 2 September 1967 in Saint Jacob&#x27;s Church in The Hague. His godparents are his maternal grandfather Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, his paternal grandmother Gösta Freiin von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, Prince Ferdinand von Bismarck, former Prime Minister Jelle Zijlstra, Jonkvrouw Renée Röell, and Queen Margrethe II.

He had two younger brothers: Prince Friso (1968–2013) and Prince Constantijn (b. 1969). He lived with his family at the castle Drakensteyn in the hamlet Lage Vuursche near Baarn from his birth until 1981, when they moved to the larger palace Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. His mother, Beatrix, became Queen of the Netherlands in 1980, after his grandmother Juliana abdicated. He then received the title of Prince of Orange as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the age of 13.

Willem-Alexander attended local state primary school Nieuwe Baarnse Elementary School in Baarn from 1973 to 1979. He went to two different state secondary schools (the Baarns Lyceum in Baarn from 1979 to 1981 and the Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague from 1981 to 1983) and the private sixth-form college United World College of the Atlantic in Wales (1983 to 1985), where he received his International Baccalaureate.

After his military service from 1985 to 1987, Willem-Alexander studied history at Leiden University from 1987 onwards and received his Master of Arts degree () in 1993. His final thesis was on the Dutch response to France&#x27;s decision under President Charles de Gaulle to leave NATO&#x27;s integrated command structure.

Willem-Alexander speaks English, Spanish, French, and German (his father&#x27;s native language) in addition to his native Dutch.

==Military training and career==

Between secondary school and his university education, Willem-Alexander performed military service in the Royal Netherlands Navy from August 1985 until January 1987. He received his training at the Royal Netherlands Naval College and in the frigates HNLMS &quot;Tromp&quot; and HNLMS &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot;, where he was an ensign. In 1988 he received additional training in the ship HNLMS &quot;Van Kinsbergen&quot; and became a lieutenant (junior grade) ().

As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Navy, Willem-Alexander was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1995, commander in 1997, Captain at Sea in 2001, and commodore in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Army, he was made a major (Grenadiers&#x27; and Rifles Guard Regiment) in 1995, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1997, colonel in 2001, and brigadier general in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Air Force, he was made squadron leader in 1995 and promoted to air commodore in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Marechaussee, he was made brigadier general in 2005.

Before his investiture as king in 2013, Willem-Alexander was honourably discharged from the armed forces. The government declared that the head of state cannot be a serving member of the armed forces, since the government itself holds supreme command over the armed forces. As king, Willem-Alexander may choose to wear a military uniform with royal insignia, but not with his former rank insignia.

==Activities and social interests==
Since 1985, when he became 18 years old, Willem-Alexander has been a member of the Council of State of the Netherlands. This is the highest council of the Dutch political system and is chaired by the head of state (then Queen Beatrix).

Willem-Alexander is interested in water management and sports issues. He was an honorary member of the World Commission on Water for the 21st century and patron of the Global Water Partnership, a body established by the World Bank, the UN, and the Swedish Ministry of Development. He was appointed as the Chairperson of the United Nations Secretary General&#x27;s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation on 12 December 2006.

On 10 October 2010, Willem-Alexander and Máxima went to the Netherlands Antilles&#x27; capital, Willemstad, to attend and represent his mother, the Queen, at the Antillean Dissolution ceremony.

He was a patron of the Dutch Olympic Games Committee until 1998 when he was made a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). After becoming King, he relinquished his membership and received the Gold Olympic Order at the 125th IOC Session. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam, he had expressed support to bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics.

He was a member of the supervisory board of (the Dutch central bank), a member of the Advisory Council of ECP (the information society forum for government, business and civil society), patron of Veterans&#x27; Day and held several other patronages and posts.

== Reign ==
On 28 January 2013, Beatrix announced her intention to abdicate. On the morning of 30 April 2013 (), Beatrix signed the instrument of abdication at the (Moses Hall) at the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. Later that afternoon, Willem-Alexander was inaugurated as king before a joint session of the States General in a ceremony held at the Nieuwe Kerk.

As king, Willem-Alexander has weekly meetings with the prime minister and speaks regularly with ministers and state secretaries. He also signs all new Acts of Parliament and royal decrees. He represents the kingdom at home and abroad. At the State Opening of Parliament, he delivers the Speech from the Throne, which announces the plans of the government for the parliamentary year. The Constitution requires that the king appoint, dismiss and swear in all government ministers and state secretaries. As king, he is also the President of the Council of State, an advisory body that reviews proposed legislation. In modern practice, the monarch seldom chairs council meetings.

At his accession at age 46, he was Europe&#x27;s youngest monarch. He is currently third-youngest after Frederik X of Denmark and Felipe VI of Spain. He is also the first male monarch of the Netherlands since the death of his great-great-grandfather William III in 1890. Willem-Alexander was one of four new sovereign monarchs in 2013 along with Pope Francis, Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, and King Philippe of Belgium.

==Other activities==
Willem-Alexander is an avid pilot and has said that if he had not been a royal, he would have liked to be an airline pilot so he could fly internationally on large-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 747. During the reign of his mother, he regularly flew the Dutch royal aircraft on trips. However, in May 2017, Willem-Alexander revealed that he had served as a first officer on KLM flights for 21 years, flying KLM Cityhopper&#x27;s Fokker 70s twice a month, even after his accession to the throne. Following KLM&#x27;s phased retirement of the Fokker 70, he began training to fly Boeing 737s. Willem-Alexander was rarely recognized while in the KLM uniform and wearing the KLM cap, though a few passengers recognized his voice, even though he never gave his name and only welcomed passengers on behalf of the captain and crew.

Using the name &quot;W. A. van Buren&quot;, one of the least-known titles of the House of Orange-Nassau, he participated in the 1986 Frisian Elfstedentocht, a distance ice skating tour. He ran the New York City Marathon under the same pseudonym in 1992. Willem-Alexander completed both events.

==Marriage and children==


On 2 February 2002, he married Máxima Zorreguieta at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The marriage triggered significant controversy due to the role the bride&#x27;s father, Jorge Zorreguieta, had in the Argentinian military dictatorship. The couple have three daughters: The Princess of Orange, Princess Alexia, and Princess Ariane.

== Privacy and the press ==
In an attempt to strike a balance between privacy for the royal family and availability to the press, the Netherlands Government Information Service (RVD) instituted a media code on 21 June 2005 which essentially states that:
* Photographs of the members of the royal house while performing their duties are always permitted.
* For other occasions (like holidays or vacations), the RVD will arrange a photo-op on condition that the press leave the family alone for the rest of the activity.

During a ski vacation in Argentina, several photographs were taken of the prince and his family during the private part of their holiday, including one by Associated Press staff photographer Natacha Pisarenko, in spite of the media code, and after a photo opportunity had been provided earlier. The Associated Press decided to publish some of the photos, which were subsequently republished by several Dutch media. Willem-Alexander and the RVD jointly filed suit against the Associated Press on 5 August 2009, and the trial started on 14 August 2009 at the district court in Amsterdam. On 28 August 2009, the district court ruled in favour of the prince and RVD, citing that the couple has a right to privacy, that the pictures in question add nothing to any public debate, and that they are not of any particular value to society since they are not photographs of his family &quot;at work&quot;. Associated Press was sentenced to stop further publication of the photographs, on pain of a fine per violation with a maximum.

In October 2020, Willem-Alexander apologised for a family holiday trip to Greece which had taken place while his country was under partial lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. He and his family cut their trip short, and in a two-minute video he stated that it &quot;hurts to have betrayed&quot; people&#x27;s trust. Earlier in August, he and his wife were photographed with a restaurant owner during another trip to Greece, which was a violation of social distancing rules at the time.

==Properties==
From 2003 until 2019, Willem-Alexander and his family lived in Villa Eikenhorst on the De Horsten Estate in Wassenaar. After his mother abdicated and became Princess Beatrix once again, she moved to the castle of Drakensteyn, after which the King and his family moved to the newly renovated monarch&#x27;s palace of Huis ten Bosch in The Hague in 2019.

Willem-Alexander has a villa near Kranidi, Greece.

===Villa in Machangulo===
On 10 July 2008, the Prince of Orange and Princess Máxima announced that they had invested in a development project on the Mozambican peninsula of Machangulo. The development project was aimed at building an ecologically responsible vacation resort, including a hotel and several luxury holiday homes for investors. The project was to invest heavily in the local economy of the peninsula (building schools and a local clinic) with an eye both towards responsible sustainability and maintaining a local staff. After contacting Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to verify that the Mozambican government had no objections, the couple decided to invest in two villas. In 2009, controversy erupted in parliament and the press about the project and the prince&#x27;s involvement. Politician Alexander Pechtold questioned the morality of building such a resort in a poor country like Mozambique. After public and parliamentary controversy, the royal couple announced that they had decided to sell the property in Machangulo once their house was completed. In January 2012, it was confirmed that the villa had been sold.

==Ancestry==
Through his father, a member of the House of Amsberg, he is descended from families of the lower German nobility, and through his mother, from several royal German–Dutch families such as the House of Lippe, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the House of Orange-Nassau, Waldeck and Pyrmont, and the House of Hohenzollern. He is descended from the first king of the Netherlands, William I of the Netherlands, who was also a ruler in Luxembourg and several German states, and all subsequent Dutch monarchs.

Through his mother, Willem-Alexander also descends from Paul I of Russia and thus from German princess Catherine the Great and Swedish King Gustav I. Through his father, he is also descended from several Dutch–Flemish families who left the Low Countries during Spanish rule, such as the Berenbergs. His paternal great-great-grandfather Gabriel von Amsberg, a major-general of Mecklenburg, was recognized as noble as late as 1891, the family having adopted the &quot;von&quot; in 1795.

Willem-Alexander is a descendant of King George II and, more relevant for his succession rights, of his granddaughter Princess Augusta of Great Britain. Under the British Act of Settlement, King Willem-Alexander temporarily forfeited his (distant) succession rights to the throne of the United Kingdom by marrying a Roman Catholic. This right has since been restored in 2015 under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.

Finally, Willem-Alexander is also a distant descendent of William the Silent, who is held to be the Father of the Nation in the Netherlands, since John William Friso, a great-great-grandson of William the Silent, is known to be a common ancestor to all current European monarchs.

Tsui Hark (, , born 15 February 1950), born Tsui Man-kong (), is a Hong Kong filmmaker. A major director in the Golden Age of Hong Kong cinema, Tsui gained critical and commercial success with films such as &quot;Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain&quot; (1983), the &quot;Once Upon a Time in China&quot; film series (1991–1997), &quot;Green Snake&quot; (1993), &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Blade&quot; (1995). His credits as a writer and producer include &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986), &quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot; (1987), &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; (1987), &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989), &quot;The Legend of the Swordsman&quot; (1992), &quot;The Wicked City&quot; (1992), &quot;Iron Monkey&quot; (1993) and &quot;Black Mask&quot; (1996). Amid the Hong Kong handover, Tsui briefly pursued a career in the United States, directing the Jean-Claude Van Damme-led films &quot;Double Team&quot; (1997) and &quot;Knock Off&quot; (1998), before returning to Hong Kong. Since the early 2000s, he has shifted to Mainland-Hong Kong co-productions and found success with blockbusters such as the &quot;Detective Dee&quot; film series, &quot;Flying Swords of Dragon Gate&quot; (2011), &quot;The Taking of Tiger Mountain&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Battle at Lake Changjin&quot; (2021). 

==Early life==
Tsui was born and raised in Saigon, Vietnam, to a large Chinese (Hoa) family with sixteen siblings. Tsui showed an early interest in show business and films; when he was 10, he and some friends rented an 8 mm camera to film a magic show they put on at school. He also drew comic books, an interest that would influence his cinematic style. By the age of 13, he and his family immigrated to Hong Kong.

Tsui started his secondary education in Hong Kong in 1966. He proceeded to study film in Texas, first at Southern Methodist University and then at the University of Texas at Austin, graduating in 1975. He claims to have told his parents he wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a pharmacist, and that it was here he changed his given name to Hark (&quot;overcoming&quot;).

After graduation, Tsui moved to New York City, where he worked on &quot;From Spikes to Spindles&quot; (1976), a noted documentary film by Christine Choy on the history of the city&#x27;s Chinatown. He also worked as an editor for a Chinese newspaper, developed a community theatre group and worked in a Chinese cable TV station. He returned to Hong Kong in 1977.

==Career==

===1977–1981: New Wave period===
Tsui returned to Hong Kong in 1977 and worked for TVB, the dominant local television station, then moved to its rival, CTV, lured by its general manager Selina Chow. Viewed as having an eye for talent (numerous future New Wave directors got their first directing gigs under Chow) she put Tsui in charge of the martial arts drama, &quot;The Gold Dagger Romance&quot;, which marked him as a talent to watch. 

Producer Ng See-yuen saw &quot;Gold Dagger Romance&quot; and hired Tsui to direct his first feature, &quot;The Butterfly Murders&quot; (1979), a technically challenging blend of wuxia, murder mystery and science fiction / fantasy elements. His second film, &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Eat You&quot; (1980), was a blend of cannibal horror, black comedy and martial arts. He was quickly typed as a member of Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;New Wave&quot; of directors.

Tsui&#x27;s third film, &quot;Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind&quot; (1980), was a nihilistic thriller about delinquent youths on a bombing spree. Heavily censored by the British colonial government, it was released in 1981 in a drastically altered version titled &quot;Dangerous Encounter – 1st Kind&quot; (or alternatively, &quot;Don&#x27;t Play with Fire&quot;). The movie out-grossed Tsui&#x27;s previous two films, however and made him a darling of film critics with writers describing it as &quot;one of those very rare films in the history of Hong Kong cinema that brims with accusation and subversion&quot; and saying that it described &quot;man as trapped animals — this is the popular theme of the New Wave and the one enduring image in their narratives.&quot;

===1980s–2000s: Golden era===
In 1981, Tsui joined Cinema City &amp; Films Co., a production company founded by comedians Raymond Wong, Karl Maka and Dean Shek. Cinema City &amp; Films Co. was instrumental in codifying the slick Hong Kong blockbuster films of the 1980s. Tsui played his part in the process with pictures like the crime farce &quot;All the Wrong Clues&quot; (1981), his first hit, and &quot;Aces Go Places 3&quot; (1984), part of the studio&#x27;s long-running spy spoof series.

In 1983, Tsui directed the wuxia fantasy film &quot;Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain&quot; (1983) for the studio Golden Harvest. Tsui imported Hollywood technicians to help create special effects whose number and complexity were unprecedented in Chinese-language cinema.

In 1984, Tsui formed the production company Film Workshop with Nansun Shi. He also developed a reputation as a hands-on and even intrusive producer of other directors&#x27; work, fuelled by public breaks with major filmmakers like John Woo and King Hu. His most longstanding and fruitful collaboration has probably been with Ching Siu-tung. As action choreographer and/or director on many Film Workshop productions, Ching made a major contribution to the well-known Tsui style.

Film Workshop releases became consistent box office hits in Hong Kong and around Asia, drawing audiences with their visual adventurousness, their broad commercial appeal, and hectic camerawork and pace. With Tsui having been called the &#x27;Steven Spielberg of Asia&#x27;, Film Workshop became the &#x27;Amblin of Hong Kong&#x27;. He produced John Woo&#x27;s &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986), which launched a craze for Heroic bloodshed movies, and Ching Siu-tung&#x27;s &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; (1987), which did the same for period ghost fantasies. &quot;Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain&quot; and &quot;The Swordsman&quot; (1990) birthed the modern-day special effects industry in Hong Kong.

In fact, Tsui&#x27;s &quot;movie brat&quot; nostalgia is one of the main ingredients in his work. He often resurrects and revises classic films and genres: the murder mystery in &quot;The Butterfly Murders&quot; (1979); the Shanghai musical comedy in &quot;Shanghai Blues&quot; (1985). &quot;Peking Opera Blues&quot; (1986) plays with and pays tribute to the traditions of the Peking opera that his mother took him to see as a small boy and which had such a strong influence on Hong Kong action cinema. &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1994) adapts a retold, cross-dressing period romance, best known from Li Han-hsiang&#x27;s 1963 opera film &quot;The Love Eterne&quot;. &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; remakes Li&#x27;s supernatural romance &quot;The Enchanting Shadow&quot; (1959) as a special effects action movie.

The pattern is also seen in perhaps Tsui&#x27;s most successful work to date, the &quot;Once Upon a Time in China&quot; film series (1991–97). Jet Li played the role of Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung in the first three films and the sixth, &quot;Once Upon a Time in China and America&quot;. This series is the clearest expression in his oeuvre of Tsui&#x27;s Chinese nationalism and his passionate engagement with the upheavals of Chinese history, particularly in the face of Western power and influence.

Tsui also dabbled in acting, mostly for other directors. Notable roles include one-third of the comic relief trio in Corey Yuen&#x27;s film &quot;Yes, Madam!&quot; (1985) and a villain in Patrick Tam&#x27;s darkly comic crime story &quot;Final Victory&quot; (1987), written by Wong Kar-wai. He also made frequent cameo appearances in his own productions, such as a music judge in &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; and a phony FBI agent in &quot;Aces Go Places II&quot;.

In the face of an industry downturn in the &#x27;90s, he produced two expensive movies. &quot;Green Snake&quot; (1993) was a poetic and lyric movie based on a favourite Chinese fairy tale. &quot;The Blade&quot; (1995) was a gory, deliberately rough-hewn revision of the 1967 wuxia classic &quot;The One-Armed Swordsman&quot;.

In the mid-to-late &#x27;90s, Tsui tried Hollywood with two films starring Jean-Claude Van Damme: &quot;Double Team&quot; (1997) and &quot;Knock Off&quot; (1998). In 2002, he made &quot;Black Mask 2: City of Masks&quot;, an American market sequel to Jet Li&#x27;s 1996 film. It was released direct-to-video in the United States in December of that year before being theatrically released the next month in Hong Kong.

===2000s–present: China-Hong Kong co-productions===

Tsui returned to directing at home in 2000 after not having made a local film since 1996. &quot;Time and Tide&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Legend of Zu&quot; (2001) were action extravaganzas with lavish computer-generated imagery that gained cult admirers but no mass success.

Tsui continues to push technical boundaries and revise old favourites. &quot;Master Q 2001&quot; was Hong Kong&#x27;s first combination of live action and Pixar-style 3D computer animation. &quot;Era of Vampires&quot; (2002; US title, &quot;Tsui Hark&#x27;s Vampire Hunters&quot;) reworked a subgenre popular in the &#x27;80s, hybrid martial arts / supernatural horror films featuring the &quot;hopping corpses&quot; of Chinese folk legend.

In 2005, Tsui launched the multimedia production &quot;Seven Swords&quot;, a film adaptation of Liang Yusheng&#x27;s novels &quot;Saiwai Qixia Zhuan&quot; and &quot;Qijian Xia Tianshan&quot;. The film came with a television series counterpart (&quot;Seven Swordsmen&quot;), a comic book series, a cellphone game, clothing brand, and an online multi-player video game. The film was relatively successful, and in February 2006 Tsui announced plans to begin filming the second late in the year. As of 2008, Tsui continues to work on the script for &quot;Seven Swords 2&quot; in between filming projects. In 2011 there has been no news nor plans about a &quot;Seven Swords 2&quot;. Rumors has it that due to lack of interest by the filmmakers of finishing the hexalogy lead the project into being cancelled.

In August 2008, Tsui provided art direction for the direct-to-video anime feature titled &quot;Kungfu Master&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Wong Fei Hong vs Kungfu Panda&quot;), an apparent unofficial sequel to &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, featuring Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung. He also directed the 2008 thriller &quot;Missing&quot; starring Angelica Lee and the 2008 romantic comedy film &quot;All About Women&quot; featuring comic graphics and extensive ADR dubbing.

Tsui&#x27;s latest work in 2010 is &quot;Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame&quot;, a rare but successful blend of wuxia, suspense-thriller, mystery, and comedy, which was in competition for the Golden Lion award and was also nominated and won numerous other awards.

In 2010 he announced his first 3-D film, &quot;The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate&quot;, which is a re-imagining of his 1992 film &quot;New Dragon Gate Inn&quot; starring Tony Leung Ka-Fai, Maggie Cheung and Brigitte Lin. In 2011 Huayi Brothers announced that Tsui will be making a prequel to &quot;Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame&quot;; shot in 3-D, it was released in 2013 as &quot;Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon&quot;.

In October 2011, Tsui received the Asian Filmmaker of the Year Award at the 16th Busan International Film Festival for his contributions to Hong Kong cinema. He is the fifth Chinese filmmaker to receive this award at Busan.

His film &quot;The Taking of Tiger Mountain&quot; premiered in China in December 2014.

Tsui worked on a film with Milkyway Image alongside Ann Hui, Ringo Lam, Patrick Tam, Johnnie To, Sammo Hung and Yuen Woo-Ping. Each director created a segment based on Hong Kong history. The completed film, &quot;&quot;, was shown at the Busan International Film Festival on 21 October 2020 and at the annual Hong Kong International Film Festival in April 2021.

In 2021 Tsui co-directed &quot;The Battle at Lake Changjin&quot; with Chen Kaige and Dante Lam. The film is the most expensive film ever produced in China, the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time, and the highest-grossing non-English film.

==Personal life==
Tsui Hark has been married twice. He was briefly married during his time studying in the U.S. in the 1970s. In 1977, he met Nansun Shi while working at Commercial Television in Hong Kong and they began dating a year later. In 1984, they founded a film studio, where Shi was responsible for financing, distribution, and promotion. The couple co-produced over a hundred films. In 1993, rumors circulated about Tsui&#x27;s affair with Sally Yeh, allegedly causing a temporary split with Shi. In 1996, Tsui and Shi married in Beverly Hills, California. In 2008, Tsui was reported to have been living with &quot;Seven Swords&quot; (2005) actress Chen Jiajia in Beijing. When asked about their status of marriage, Shi then responded, &quot;Let me give you a standard answer. I&#x27;ve been saying this for years: what happens between two people is private and doesn&#x27;t concern a third party.&quot; By 2011, Tsui began dating his assistant, Lele, whom he had met online during the filming of &quot;Flying Swords of Dragon Gate&quot; (2011). Shi announced their divorce in 2014, adding that Tsui and Lele had been together for some time.

<doc id="100386" wikidata="Q352981" url="?curid=100386" title="Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau">
<text>Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau (; 25 September 1968 – 12 August 2013) was the second son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Claus von Amsberg, and younger brother of King Willem-Alexander. Friso was a member of the Dutch Royal Family, but because of his marriage without an Act of Consent in 2004, he lost his membership of the Dutch Royal House and was no longer in the line of succession to the throne.

On 17 February 2012, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche in Lech, Austria, while skiing off piste. He was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck, where he was in a critical but stable condition. According to his doctor, even though he was trapped for a relatively short time and hopes had originally been higher, subsequent neurological tests showed that after fifty minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in moderate hypothermia, he suffered massive brain damage due to oxygen shortage. His initial coma later progressed to a minimally conscious state, and it was unclear whether he would ever regain full consciousness. On 12 August 2013, one and a half years after the accident, Prince Friso died from complications.

==Early life and education==
Johan Friso Bernhard Christiaan David was born on 25 September 1968 at the Academic Hospital Utrecht (now the University Medical Center Utrecht) in Utrecht, Netherlands. He was the second son of Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus, and grandson of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard. He had one older brother, current King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands (b. 1967), and one younger brother, Prince Constantijn (b. 1969).

His titles at birth were Prince of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, and Jonkheer van Amsberg. Prince Friso was baptized on 28 December 1968 in the Dom Church in Utrecht. His godparents were Prince Harald of Norway, Johan Christian Baron von Jenisch, Herman van Roijen, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Christina von Amsberg.

In 1986, he graduated from the secondary school &quot;Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum&quot; in The Hague. From 1986 until 1988, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1988 he studied at Delft University of Technology, where he obtained an engineer&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering in 1994. From 1990 he also went to the Erasmus University Rotterdam, where he obtained an MSc degree in business economics in 1995. Subsequently, he attended INSEAD (Fontainebleau, France), where he received an MBA degree in 1997.

==Work==
Prince Friso worked from 1995 to 1996 at the Amsterdam branch of the international management consultancy McKinsey. After completing an MBA-programme at INSEAD, Prince Friso worked from 1998 to 2003 as a vice president at Goldman Sachs International in London. In 2004, he became part-time co-president of TNO Space in Delft. From October 2006, Prince Friso was managing director in the London office of a private investment and advisory firm, Wolfensohn &amp; Company.

Prince Friso was a co-founder of the MRI Centre in Amsterdam and was also a founding shareholder of Wizzair, the largest low-cost airline in Eastern Europe. He was honorary chairman of the Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development (a position he held together with his younger brother, Prince Constantijn).

Prior to his accident, Prince Friso was working as a chief financial officer for URENCO, a uranium enrichment company.

==Marriage and children==
On 30 June 2003, it was announced that Prince Friso was to marry Mabel Wisse Smit. The Dutch cabinet, however, did not seek permission from parliament for this marriage, a constitutional requirement if Prince Friso was to remain a member of the Dutch Royal House and in line of succession for the throne; at the time, he was second in line after his older brother, Willem-Alexander.

The Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende explained that this was due to discussions with Mabel Wisse Smit in October 2003, when she had admitted that her previous statements about an alleged relationship with Klaas Bruinsma (1953–1991), a known Dutch drug baron, had not been complete and accurate. She had previously stated that she had contact for a few months with Bruinsma, but in a casual context, neither intimate nor relating to business, and that she had broken the contact on learning of Bruinsma&#x27;s occupation.

This &quot;breach of trust&quot; was the reason the government did not seek parliamentary permission, respecting the wishes of the couple. They nevertheless married at Oude Kerk (Delft) on 24 April 2004, and Mabel Wisse Smit became a member of the Dutch Royal Family but not a member of the Dutch Royal House.

Considering that his elder brother King Willem-Alexander has three daughters, Prince Friso&#x27;s exclusion from the succession was unlikely to have an effect on the monarchy in the Netherlands.

After their marriage, Prince Friso and his wife Princess Mabel set up home in London, in the suburb of Kew.

The couple&#x27;s first daughter, Countess Emma Luana Ninette Sophie of Orange-Nassau, &quot;Jonkvrouwe van Amsberg&quot;, was born on 26 March 2005 in London. Their second daughter, Countess Joanna Zaria Nicoline Milou of Orange-Nassau, &quot;Jonkvrouwe van Amsberg&quot;, was born on 18 June 2006, also in London.

==Avalanche accident==
===Accident===
On 17 February 2012, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche in Lech, Austria, and he was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck. According to a formal statement of the Netherlands Government Information Service (RVD), a prognosis could be given only after some days. The prince&#x27;s condition was described as &quot;stable, but critical&quot;.

===Resulting complications===
The Dutch Royal Family issued a statement on 19 February saying &quot;The Royal Family is very grateful and deeply touched by all expressions of support and sympathy after the ski accident of His Royal Highness Prince Friso. It was a great support for them during this difficult time.&quot;

A prognosis on his health situation was expected within a few days, but this was pushed back to 24 February, a week after his accident. The RVD&#x27;s comment remained the same: stable, but critical. On 24 February, an Innsbruck medical team announced that the prince had been buried for 25 minutes, followed by a 50-minute CPR to treat his cardiac arrest. Wolfgang Koller stated that an MRI scan was performed a day earlier revealing little change, however other neurological tests indicated significant damage due to oxygen shortage. It remained unclear whether the prince would ever regain full consciousness. Koller said that the Prince&#x27;s family might now look for a rehabilitation institution. On the same day the Dutch Royal Family issued a statement requesting that the privacy of the Prince&#x27;s family be respected to enable them to come to terms with his condition.

On 1 March 2012, Prince Friso was transferred to the Wellington Hospital, in London where he and his wife had lived for many years.

On 19 November 2012, it was announced that the prince had started to show some signs of consciousness but it was still not certain whether he would ever wake up, and if he did, in what state.

On 9 July 2013, Prince Friso was moved back to Huis ten Bosch in the Netherlands. It was understood that his coma had then evolved into a minimally conscious state. As he was no longer in need of hospital-level medical care, he stayed with his family for the summer.

==Death and funeral==

On 12 August 2013, it was announced that Prince Friso had died in Huis ten Bosch due to complications from the accident. He was buried on 16 August in the Dutch Reformed Cemetery in the hamlet of Lage Vuursche near Drakesteijn Castle, where he had spent his childhood and where Princess Beatrix returned to live in February 2014. The funeral service, at Stulpkerk church, was strictly private. Members of the public and media could not attend, nor did members of other royal families attend, with the exception of Friso&#x27;s godfather, King Harald V of Norway. A ceremony of commemoration was held on 2 November 2013 in the Oude Kerk in Delft.

==Titles, styles and honours==
===Titles and styles===
* 25 September 1968 – 19 March 2004: &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; Prince Johan-Friso of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, Jonkheer van Amsberg
* 19 March 2004 – 12 August 2013: &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, Count of Orange-Nassau, Jonkheer van Amsberg

Under the Act on the Membership of the Royal House (2002), Prince Friso lost the title &#x27;Prince of the Netherlands&#x27; by entering into a marriage without an Act of Consent.

By a royal decree of 19 March 2004, Prince Friso was granted the surname &#x27;Van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg&#x27;, the hereditary noble predicate &#x27;Jonkheer (Jonkvrouw) van Amsberg and the hereditary title &#x27;Count of Orange-Nassau&#x27;, to take effect upon his marriage.

By the same decree, he was allowed to retain his title &#x27;Prince of Orange-Nassau&#x27; as a personal and non-hereditary title and the style of &#x27;Royal Highness&#x27;. According to the notification of this Royal Decree, any children born to the couple were to receive the surname &#x27;van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg&#x27; and become a &#x27;Count (Countess) of Orange-Nassau&#x27; and also have the noble predicate &#x27;Jonkheer (Jonkvrouw) van Amsberg&#x27;. So his children had the same titles and names as those of Prince Constantijn, and showing that they belong to the royal family descending from Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus. In social use, they are named with their comital title. His wife acquired the feminine version of her husband&#x27;s style and titles as a courtesy title, since it is customary for wives of members of the royal family to take the titles of their husbands.

Referred to from birth as Prince Johan-Friso, in 2004, the royal court announced that he had requested that he would henceforth be called &quot;Prince Friso&quot;.

<doc id="100387" wikidata="Q355254" url="?curid=100387" title="Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands">
<text>Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands (&quot;Constantijn Christof Frederik Aschwin&quot;; born 11 October 1969) is the third and youngest son of the former Dutch queen, Beatrix, and her husband, Claus von Amsberg, and is the younger brother of the reigning Dutch king, Willem-Alexander. He is a member of the Dutch Royal House and currently fourth in the line of succession to the Dutch throne behind his nieces.

==Life and career==

Prince Constantijn was born on 11 October 1969 at Academic Hospital Utrecht (now the University Medical Center Utrecht) in Utrecht following the births of his brothers, Willem-Alexander (b. 1967), and Johan Friso (1968–2013). He goes by the nickname &quot;Tijn&quot;. His godparents are former King Constantine II of Greece (1940–2023), Prince Aschwin of Lippe-Biesterfeld, Axel Freiherr von dem Bussche-Streithorst, Max Kohnstamm, and Corinne de Beaufort-Sickinghe.

Prince Constantijn studied law at Leiden University, becoming a lawyer, and then worked at the Brussels department of the (Dutch) European Union commissioner of foreign relations, Hans van den Broek. Later, he was hired by the EU and continued to work there in various capacities until the end of 1999. In December 2000, he was awarded a Master of Business Administration at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France. He spent a summer working for the International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) in Washington, DC. He worked until late 2002 for strategic consultants Booz Allen Hamilton in London. Since 2003, he works for the RAND Corporation Europe in Brussels. Furthermore, he has a part-time position at the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague.

Prince Constantijn rarely attends public events in his capacity as a member of the Dutch royal family. He is a keen sportsman and enjoys football, tennis, golf, and skiing. His other hobbies include drawing, cooking, and reading.

==Marriage and family==
The engagement of Prince Constantijn and Petra Laurentien Brinkhorst was announced on 16 December 2000. The civil marriage was conducted by the mayor of The Hague, Wim Deetman, in the Oude Raadzaal, Javastraat, The Hague, on 17 May 2001. The church wedding took place two days later on 19 May in the Grote of St Jacobskerk, with the Reverend Carel ter Linden officiating.

Prince Constantijn and Princess Laurentien have three children: Eloise (b. 2002), Claus-Casimir (b. 2004), and Leonore (b. 2006). The family then moved from Brussels, where they lived, to The Hague.

Upon the abdication of Queen Beatrix on 30 April 2013, the children of Prince Constantijn and Princess Laurentien ceased to be members of the Royal House, although they continue to be members of the royal family and remain in the line of succession.

<doc id="100390" wikidata="Q160918" url="?curid=100390" title="Opus Dei">
<text>is an institution of the Catholic Church that was founded in Spain in 1928 by Josemaría Escrivá. Its stated mission is to help its lay and clerical members seek holiness in their everyday occupations and societies. Opus Dei is officially recognized within the Catholic Church, although its status has evolved. It received final approval by the Catholic Church in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. Pope John Paul II made it a personal prelature in 1982 by the apostolic constitution &quot;Ut sit&quot;. The group is considered controversial and has been criticised for having cult-like qualities.

Laypeople make up the majority of its membership; the remainder are secular priests under the governance of a prelate elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope. As &quot;Opus Dei&quot; is Latin for &quot;Work of God&quot;, the organization is often referred to by members and supporters as &quot;the Work&quot;. Aside from their personal charity and social services, they organize training in Catholic spirituality applied to daily life. Opus Dei members are located in more than 90 countries. About 70% of members live in their own homes, leading family lives with secular careers, while the other 30% are celibate, of whom the majority live in Opus Dei centers.

== History ==

=== Foundational period ===
Opus Dei was founded by Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. According to Escrivá, on that day he experienced a vision in which he &quot;saw Opus Dei&quot;. He gave the organization the name &quot;Opus Dei&quot;, which in Latin means &quot;Work of God&quot;, in order to underscore the belief that the organization was not his (Escrivá&#x27;s) work, but was rather God&#x27;s work. Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character. Escrivá summarized Opus Dei&#x27;s mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians &quot;to understand that their life ... is a way of holiness and evangelization ... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice.&quot;

Initially, Opus Dei was open only to men, but in 1930, Escrivá started to admit women, based on what he believed to be a communication from God. Persecuted during the Spanish Civil War and narrowly escaping death several times, in 1939 Escrivá was able to return to Madrid after three years of hiding. In 1939, Escrivá published &quot;The Way&quot;, a collection of 999 maxims concerning spirituality for people involved in secular affairs.

Opus Dei rapidly grew during the years of the Franquismo, spreading first throughout Spain, and after 1945, expanding internationally. Escrivá had to overcome many obstacles. He later recounted that it was in Spain where Opus Dei found &quot;the greatest difficulties&quot; because of &quot;enemies of personal freedom&quot;, and traditionalists who he felt misunderstood Opus Dei&#x27;s ideas. 

In 1947, a year after Escrivá moved the organization&#x27;s headquarters to Rome, Opus Dei received a decree of praise and approval from Pope Pius XII, making it an institute of &quot;pontifical right&quot;, i.e. under the direct governance of the Pope. In 1950, Pius XII granted definitive approval to Opus Dei, thereby allowing married people to join the organization, and secular clergy to be admitted to the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross. Several Opus Dei members such as Alberto Ullastres were ministers under the dictator Franco in Spain (Opus Dei and politics).

=== Post-foundational years ===
In 1975, Escrivá died and was succeeded by Álvaro del Portillo. In 1982, Opus Dei was made into a personal prelature. This means that Opus Dei is part of the Catholic Church, and the apostolate of the members falls under the direct jurisdiction of the prelate of Opus Dei wherever they are. As to &quot;what the law lays down for all the ordinary faithful&quot;, the lay members of Opus Dei, being no different from other Catholics, &quot;continue to be ... under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop&quot;, in the words of John Paul II&#x27;s Apostolic Constitution, &quot;Ut Sit&quot;.

One-third of the world&#x27;s bishops sent letters petitioning for the canonization of Escrivá. Escrivá was beatified in 1992 in the midst of controversy prompted by questions about his suitability for sainthood. In 2002, approximately 300,000 people gathered in St. Peter&#x27;s Square on the day Pope John Paul II canonized him. There are other members whose process of beatification has been opened: Ernesto Cofiño, a father of five children and a pioneer in pediatric research in Guatemala; Montserrat Grases, a teenage Catalan student who died of cancer; Toni Zweifel, a Swiss engineer; Tomás Alvira and wife, Paquita Domínguez, a Spanish married couple; Isidoro Zorzano Ledesma, an Argentinian engineer; Dora del Hoyo, a domestic worker; Fr. José María Hernández Garnica; and Father José Luis Múzquiz de Miguel, a Spanish priest who began Opus Dei in the United States.

During the pontificate of John Paul II, two members of Opus Dei, Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne and Julián Herranz Casado, were made cardinals. In September 2005, Pope Benedict XVI blessed a newly installed statue of Josemaría Escrivá placed in an outside wall niche of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, a place for founders of Catholic organizations. During that same year, Opus Dei received attention due to the success of the novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself work against the protagonists. The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.

In 2014, Pope Francis through a delegate beatified Álvaro del Portillo and said that &quot;he teaches us that in the simplicity and ordinariness of our life we can find a sure path to holiness&quot;. At the end of 2014, the prelature has spread to 69 countries, while its members are present in 90 countries. Javier Echevarría Rodríguez, the second prelate of Opus Dei, died on 12 December 2016, and was succeeded by Fernando Ocáriz. He was elected the new prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017, and on the same day was appointed by Pope Francis as such.

In 2019, Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri, one of the first women who joined Opus Dei, was beatified in Madrid, Spain. She is the first woman of the group to be beatified. Earlier in 2005, the first publicly-known sexual abuse case of Opus Dei in the US, against C. John McCloskey, was settled for $977,000. Opus Dei publicly acknowledged a sexual abuse case within the organisation for the first time in its history in July 2020, this one involving priest Manuel Cociña in Spain.

==== Pope Francis: &quot;Safeguard the charism&quot; ====
On 22 July 2022, Pope Francis issued the apostolic letter in the form of a , which seeks to &quot;safeguard the charism&quot;, or original foundational spirit; it is &quot;intended to confirm the Prelature of Opus Dei in the authentically charismatic sphere of the Church, specifying its organization in keeping with the witness of the Founder.&quot; Among other things, the new disposition decrees that the head of the Opus Dei can no longer become a bishop, but &quot;is granted, by reason of his office, the use of the title of Supernumerary Apostolic Protonotary with the title of Reverend Monsignor and therefore may use the insignia [including heraldic devices] corresponding to this title&quot;. It also transfers responsibility for the personal prelature &quot;Opus Dei&quot; from the Dicastery for Bishops to the Dicastery for the Clergy, conforming to the apostolic constitution &quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, and mandates revision of the statutes of the personal prelature to bring them into conformity with these reforms. This reform became effective on 4 August 2022, and Pope Francis explained that this action was carried out in consultation with canon lawyers of Opus Dei and had no negative connotation for he has very positive sentiments for Opus Dei. On 8 August 2023, Pope Francis issued a new &quot;motu proprio&quot; which stated that personal prelatures such as Opus Dei, are &quot;similar to public clerical associations of pontifical law&quot;, such as the Community of Saint Martin and the Family of Mary, while not being identified with them.

== Spirituality ==

=== Doctrine ===
Opus Dei places emphasis on certain aspects of Catholic doctrine. A central point of focus in Opus Dei&#x27;s theology is the lives of the Catholic laypeople. Opus Dei emphasizes the &quot;universal call to holiness&quot;: the belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint, as per Jesus&#x27; commandment to &quot;Love God with all your heart&quot; (Matthew 22:37) and &quot;Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.&quot; (Matthew 5:48) Opus Dei also teaches that sanctity is within the reach of everyone, given Jesus&#x27; teaching that his demands are &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;light,&quot; as his divine assistance is assured.

Opus Dei does not have monks or nuns; only a minority of its members are priests. Opus Dei emphasizes uniting spiritual life with professional, social, and family life. Members of Opus Dei lead ordinary lives, with traditional families and secular careers, and strive to &quot;sanctify ordinary life&quot;. Pope John Paul II called Escrivá &quot;the saint of ordinary life&quot;. Similarly, Opus Dei stresses the importance of work and professional competence. Opus Dei exhorts its members and all lay Catholics to &quot;find God in daily life&quot; and to perform their work as a service to society and as an offering to God. Opus Dei teaches that work not only contributes to social progress but is a &quot;path to holiness&quot;.

The biblical roots of this Catholic doctrine, according to the founder, are in the phrase &quot;God created man to work&quot; (Genesis 2:15) and Jesus&#x27; time as a carpenter in a small town. Escrivá also points to the gospel account that Jesus &quot;has done everything well&quot; (Mark 7:37). The foundation of the Christian life, as stressed by Escrivá, is &quot;divine filiation&quot;: Christians are children of God, identified with Christ&#x27;s life and mission. Other main ideals of Opus Dei, according to its official literature, are freedom, respecting choice, taking personal responsibility, charity, and love of God above all and love of others.

At the bottom of Escrivá&#x27;s understanding of the &quot;universal call to holiness&quot; are two dimensions, subjective and objective, according to Fernando Ocariz, a Catholic theologian and prelate of Opus Dei since 2017. The subjective is the call given to each person to become a saint, regardless of their place in society. The objective refers to what Escrivá calls Christian materialism: all of creation, even the most material situation, is a meeting place with God, and leads to union with him.

=== Prayers ===

All members – whether married or unmarried, priests or laypeople – are trained to follow a &#x27;plan of life&#x27;, or &#x27;the norms of piety&#x27;, which are traditional Catholic devotions. This is in order to follow the teaching of the Catholic Catechism: &quot;pray at specific times...to nourish continual prayer&quot;.

=== Mortification ===

Public attention has focused on Opus Dei&#x27;s practice of mortification of the flesh. Examples include fasting and remaining silent for certain hours during the day when this is compatible with family or professional duties. Mortification has a long history in many world religions, including the Catholic Church. Popes have endorsed it as a way of &#x27;following Christ&#x27;, who died of crucifixion and who, speaking of anybody that sought to be his disciple, said: &quot;let him deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me&quot; (Luke 9:23).

== Organization and activities ==

The Catholic News Agency website published on 26 August 2024, a report headlined &quot;Opus Dei prelate responds to those who consider group &#x27;conservative powerful and secretive. The prelate pointed out in the article; &quot;the main contribution of Opus Dei is to accompany the laity [98% of its members] so that they can be protagonists of the evangelizing mission of the Church in the midst of the world, one by one.&quot;

=== Governance ===

In Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1982 decree known as the Apostolic constitution &quot;Ut Sit&quot;, Opus Dei was established as a personal prelature, an official structure of the Catholic Church, similar to a diocese in that it contains lay people and secular priests led by a bishop. However, whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese, the prelate of Opus Dei is pastor to the members and priests of Opus Dei worldwide, no matter what diocese they are in. Opus Dei is the only personal prelature in existence. In addition to being governed by &quot;Ut Sit&quot; and by the Catholic Church&#x27;s general law, Opus Dei is governed by the church&#x27;s Particular Law concerning Opus Dei, otherwise known as Opus Dei&#x27;s statutes. This specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature. The prelature is under the Congregation for Bishops.

Opus Dei&#x27;s highest assembled bodies are the General Congresses, which are convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s branches of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the prelate and are responsible for advising him about the prelature&#x27;s future. The men&#x27;s General Congress also elects the prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts. After the death of a prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.

The head of the Opus Dei prelature is known as the prelate. The prelate is the primary governing authority and is assisted by two councils—the General Council (made up of men) and the Central Advisory (made up of women). The prelate holds his position for life. The current prelate of Opus Dei is Fernando Ocáriz Braña, who became the third prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017. The first prelate of Opus Dei was Álvaro del Portillo, who held the position from 1982 until his death in 1994.

=== Membership ===
, the faithful of the Opus Dei Prelature numbered 95,318 members, of which 93,203 are lay persons, men and women, and 2,115 priests. These figures do not include the priest members of Opus Dei&#x27;s Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005. About 60 percent of Opus Dei faithful reside in Europe, and 35 percent reside in the Americas. Women comprise 57% of the total membership. According to the study of John Allen, for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle to low levels in society in terms of education, income, and social status.

Opus Dei is made up of several different types of faithful. According to the Statutes of Opus Dei, the distinction derives from the degree to which they make themselves available for the official activities of the Prelature and for giving formation according to the spirit of Opus Dei. Supernumeraries, the largest type, currently account for about 70% of the total membership. Typically, supernumeraries are married men and women with careers. Supernumeraries devote a portion of their day to prayer, in addition to attending regular meetings and taking part in activities such as retreats. Due to their career and family obligations, supernumeraries are not as available to the organization as the other types of faithful, but typically contribute financially and lend other types of assistance as their circumstances permit.

Numeraries, the second largest type of the faithful of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of the total membership. &quot;Numerary&quot; is a general term for persons who form part of the permanent staff of an organization. In Opus Dei, numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in &quot;full availability&quot; () for the official undertakings of the Prelature. A study comparing Scientology and Opus Dei found some similarities as well as strong differences. This includes full availability for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members, for staffing the internal government of Opus Dei if asked by the regional directors, and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by the prelate. Numeraries are expected to live in gender-specific centers run by Opus Dei, and the question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon the regional needs. It is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and &quot;get-togethers&quot; in which the sharing of news and conversation takes place. Numeraries generally have jobs outside of Opus Dei, although some are asked to work internally full-time, and thus change their professional goals in order to be available for the Prelature. The majority of numerary income is contributed to the organization. 

Numerary assistants are a type of numerary that exists in the Women&#x27;s Branch of Opus Dei. They are responsible for the &quot;domestic tasks in the Centres of Opus Dei, which they willingly undertake as their professional work.&quot; 
Associates are celibate faithful who take on one or more apostolic assignment(s) from the Prelature in giving doctrinal and ascetical formation and/or coordinating activities. They differ from numeraries in not making themselves &quot;fully&quot; available to staff the official undertakings of the Prelature, instead giving themselves in additional social realities, such as through their profession or to their own families. Because of this difference in availability for the official activities of Opus Dei, unlike numeraries the associates do not live in Opus Dei centers but maintain their own abodes. The Clergy of the Opus Dei Prelature are priests who are under the jurisdiction of the prelate of Opus Dei. They are a minority in Opus Dei that makes up about 2% of Opus Dei members.

The Priestly Society of the Holy Cross consists of priests associated with Opus Dei. Part of the society is made up of the clergy of the Opus Dei prelature—priests who fall under the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei prelature are automatically members of the Priestly Society. Other members in the society are diocesan priests—clergymen who remain under the jurisdiction of a geographically defined diocese. These priests are considered full members of Opus Dei who are given its spiritual training. They do not, however, report to the Opus Dei prelate but to their own diocesan bishop. , there were roughly two thousand of these priests. 

The Cooperators of Opus Dei are non-members who collaborate in some way with Opus Dei—usually through praying, charitable contributions, or by providing some other assistance. Cooperators are not required to be celibate or to adhere to any other special requirements, and are not even required to be Christian. There were 164,000 cooperators in the year 2005. In accordance with Catholic theology, membership is granted when a vocation or divine calling is presumed to have occurred.

=== Activities ===
Leaders of Opus Dei describe the organization as a teaching entity whose main activity is to train Catholics to assume personal responsibility in sanctifying the secular world from within. Others describe it as a cult. This teaching is done by means of theory and practice.

Its lay people and priests organize seminars, workshops, retreats, and classes to help people put the Christian faith into practice in their daily lives. Spiritual direction, one-on-one coaching with a more experienced lay person or priest, is considered the &quot;paramount means&quot; of training. Through these activities, they provide religious instruction (doctrinal formation), coaching in spirituality for lay people (spiritual formation), character and moral education (human formation), lessons in sanctifying one&#x27;s work (professional formation), and know-how in evangelizing one&#x27;s family and workplace (apostolic formation).

The official Catholic document, which established the prelature, states that Opus Dei strives &quot;to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to sanctity, and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work, and by means of ordinary work.&quot; Thus, the founder and his followers describe members of Opus Dei as resembling the members of the early Christian Church—ordinary workers who seriously sought holiness with nothing exterior to distinguish them from other citizens.

Opus Dei runs residential centers throughout the world. These centers provide residential housing for celibate members and provide doctrinal and theological education. Opus Dei is also responsible for a variety of non-profit institutions called &quot;Corporate Works of Opus Dei.&quot; A study of the year 2005 showed that members have cooperated with other people in setting up a total of 608 social initiatives: schools and university residences (68%), technical or agricultural training centers (26%), universities, business schools, and hospitals (6%). The University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, and the Austral University in Buenos Aires, Argentina, are both examples of the corporate work of Opus Dei. These universities usually perform very high in international rankings. IESE, the University of Navarra&#x27;s Business School, was adjudged one of the best in the world by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and the &quot;Economist Intelligence Unit&quot;. The total assets of non-profits connected to Opus Dei are worth at least $2.8 billion.

== Relations with Catholic leaders ==
Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, the bishop of Madrid, where Opus Dei was born, supported Opus Dei and defended it in the 1940s by saying that &quot;this &quot;opus&quot; is truly &quot;Dei&quot;&quot; (this work is truly God&#x27;s). Contrary to attacks of secrecy and heresy, the bishop described Opus Dei&#x27;s founder as someone who was &quot;open as a child&quot; and &quot;most obedient to the Church hierarchy&quot;.

In the 1950s, Pope Pius XII told the most senior Australian bishop, Cardinal Norman Gilroy, that Escrivá &quot;is a true saint, a man sent by God for our times&quot;. Pius XII gave Opus Dei the canonical status of &quot;pontifical right&quot;, an institution depending directly and exclusively on the Vatican in its internal governance. In 1960, Pope John XXIII commented that Opus Dei opens up &quot;unsuspected horizons of &quot;. Furthermore, in 1964, Pope Paul VI praised the organization in a handwritten letter to Escrivá, saying:
Opus Dei is &quot;a vigorous expression of the perennial youth of the Church, fully open to the demands of a modern apostolate ... We look with paternal satisfaction on all that Opus Dei has achieved and is achieving for the kingdom of God, the desire of doing good that guides it, the burning love for the Church and its visible head that distinguishes it, and the ardent zeal for souls that impels it along the arduous and difficult paths of the apostolate of presence and witness in every sector of contemporary life.&quot;
The relationship between Paul VI and Opus Dei, according to Alberto Moncada, a doctor of sociology and ex-member, was &quot;stormy&quot;. After the Second Vatican Council concluded in 1965, Pope Paul VI denied Opus Dei&#x27;s petition to become a personal prelature, Moncada stated. Pope John Paul I, a few years before his election, wrote that Escrivá was more radical than other saints who taught about the universal call to holiness. While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, Escrivá &quot;it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity&quot;, thus providing a lay spirituality.

Criticisms against Opus Dei have prompted Catholic scholars and writers like Piers Paul Read and Vittorio Messori to call Opus Dei a sign of contradiction, in reference to the biblical quote of Jesus as a &quot;sign that is spoken against&quot;. John Carmel Heenan, Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, said: &quot;One of the proofs of God&#x27;s favor is to be a sign of contradiction. Almost all founders of societies in the Church have suffered. Monsignor Escrivá de Balaguer is no exception. Opus Dei has been attacked, and its motives misunderstood. In this country and elsewhere, an inquiry has always vindicated Opus Dei.&quot;

One of Opus Dei&#x27;s most prominent supporters was Pope John Paul II. John Paul II cited Opus Dei&#x27;s aim of sanctifying secular activities as a &quot;great ideal&quot;. He emphasized that Escrivá&#x27;s founding of Opus Dei was , led by divine inspiration, and he granted the organization its status as a personal prelature. Stating that Escrivá is &quot;counted among the great witnesses of Christianity&quot;, John Paul II canonized him in 2002 and called him &quot;the saint of ordinary life&quot;. Of the organization, John Paul II said:


Concerning the group&#x27;s role in the Catholic Church, critics have argued that Opus Dei&#x27;s unique status as a personal prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a &quot;church within a church&quot; and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself, as illustrated, for example, by the rapid canonization of Escrivá, which some considered to be irregular (27 years). In contrast, Catholic officials say that church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope, and its status as a prelature &quot;precisely means dependence&quot;. Allen says that Escrivá&#x27;s relatively quick canonization does not have anything to do with power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II&#x27;s decision to make Escrivá&#x27;s sanctity and message known. The canonizations of John Paul II himself and Mother Teresa were much faster than Escrivá&#x27;s.

Pope Benedict XVI has been a particularly strong supporter of Opus Dei and of Escrivá. Pointing to the name &quot;Work of God&quot;, Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) wrote that &quot;The Lord simply made use of [Escrivá] who allowed God to work.&quot; Ratzinger cited Escrivá for correcting the mistaken idea that holiness is reserved for some extraordinary people who are completely different from ordinary sinners: Even if he can be very weak, with many mistakes in his life, a saint is nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend, allowing God to work, the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy.

Ratzinger spoke of Opus Dei&#x27;s &quot;surprising union of absolute fidelity to the Church&#x27;s great tradition, to its faith, and unconditional openness to all the challenges of this world, whether in the academic world, in the field of work, or in matters of the economy, etc.&quot; He further explained:

Pope Francis is &quot;the first Pope who has dealt with Opus Dei closely as a bishop&quot;, and, according to fellow Jesuit James V. Schall, is a &quot;friend of Opus Dei&quot;. Pope Francis himself said that &quot;I am very close friend of the Opus Dei, I love them a lot.&quot; Francis referred to St. Josemaria as &quot;a precursor of Vatican II in proposing the universal call to holiness&quot;. In the analysis of John Allen, Pope Francis&#x27; strong dislike for clericalism, which he calls &quot;one of the worst evils&quot; in the church, is a key factor for &quot;what Francis admires about Opus Dei since Escrivá&#x27;s emphasis on the dignity of the laity was a challenge to the ultra-clerical ethos of Spanish Catholicism in the late 1920s.&quot; He has a devotion to St. Josemaria, and he prayed before his relics for 45 minutes when he once visited the church of the prelature in Rome. Francis beatified Alvaro del Portillo, the successor of Escrivá. Bergoglio said that what he most liked about Opus Dei was the work done for the poor by one of its schools in Buenos Aires. He thanked Opus Dei for its work to further the holiness of priests in the Roman Curia.

== Controversy ==
Throughout its history, Opus Dei has been criticized from many quarters, prompting journalists to describe Opus Dei as &quot;the most controversial force in the Catholic Church&quot; and founder Josemaría Escrivá as a &quot;polarizing&quot; figure. Criticism of Opus Dei has centered on allegations of secretiveness, controversial and aggressive recruiting methods, strict rules governing members, elitism and misogyny, and support of or participation in authoritarian or right-wing governments, including Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime, which governed Spain until 1975. The mortification of the flesh practiced by some of its members is also criticized. Opus Dei has also been criticized for allegedly seeking independence and more influence within the Catholic Church; however, according to some journalists who have researched Opus Dei separately, many criticisms against Opus Dei are based on fabrications by opponents.

In the 21st century, Opus Dei has received international attention due to the novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and its film version of 2006, both of which prominent Christians and others criticized as misleading, inaccurate and anti-Catholic. Critics such as the Jesuit Wlodimir Ledóchowski refer to Opus Dei as a Catholic, Christian, or White form of Freemasonry. Critics of Opus Dei include María del Carmen Tapia, an ex-member who was a high-ranking officer of Opus Dei for many years; liberal Catholic theologians such as James Martin, a Jesuit writer and editor; and supporters of liberation theology, such as journalist Penny Lernoux and Michael Walsh, a writer on religious matters and former Jesuit. Critics state that Opus Dei is &quot;intensely secretive.&quot; However, members make their affiliations public and, in fact, host activities for all ages. This practice has led to much speculation about who may be a member. Due in part to its secrecy, the Jesuit-run magazine &quot;America&quot; referred to it as &quot;the most controversial group in the Catholic Church today&quot;.

Opus Dei has been accused of deceptive and aggressive recruitment practices, such as showering potential members with intense praise (&quot;love bombing&quot;), and instructing numeraries to form friendships and attend social gatherings explicitly for recruiting purposes. Critics allege that Opus Dei maintains an extremely high degree of control over its members—for instance, past rules required numeraries to submit their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors for inspection, and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors. Critics charge that Opus Dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non-members, including their own families. Exit counselor David Clark has described Opus Dei as &quot;very cult-like&quot;. Opus Dei was investigated as a cult by the Belgian government after an investigation, and some aspects were found to be cult-like. The organisation has parallels with, but also very strong differences to, Scientology.

Critics assert that Escrivá and the organization supported radical right-wing governments, such as those of Franco, Augusto Pinochet and Alberto Fujimori of Peru during the 1990s. Both Pinochet&#x27;s and Fujimori&#x27;s ministries and prominent supporters allegedly included members of Opus Dei, but there are also prominent Opus Dei members in parties that opposed those governments. Likewise, among Opus Dei members, there were also strong detractors of Franco, such as Antonio Fontán. There have also been allegations that Escrivá expressed sympathy for Adolf Hitler. One former Opus Dei priest, Vladimir Felzmann, who has become a vocal Opus Dei critic, says that Escrivá once remarked that Hitler had been &quot;badly treated&quot; by the world and he further declared that &quot;Hitler couldn&#x27;t have been such a bad person. He couldn&#x27;t have killed six million [Jews]. It couldn&#x27;t have been more than four million.&quot; Opus Dei has also been accused of elitism through targeting of &quot;the intellectual elite, the well-to-do, and the socially prominent&quot;.

As members of Opus Dei are Catholics, Opus Dei has been subjected to the same criticisms targeted to Catholicism in general. For example, Opus Dei&#x27;s position has been &quot;to oppose sexual freedoms and promote conservative morals,&quot; according to an investigative report produced by Catholics for Choice, a group that dissents from many church teachings, notably abortion. The report further cites a study from sociologist Marco Burgos alleging Opus Dei interference in sex education programs in Honduras that contradict the Catholic faith.

Between 1950 and 1980, as many as 300,000 illegal adoptions occurred in Spain in a scandal known as the lost children of Francoism. Many Catholic clergy and religious sisters at church-sponsored hospitals or other charitable organizations in Spain are alleged to have been involved, including members of Opus Dei. The Opus Dei organisation has been described as a &quot;Holy Mafia&quot; or &quot;Santa Mafia&quot; in the 1970s due to alleged &quot;inscrutable business practices&quot;. After conducting a critical study of Opus Dei, Catholic journalist John L. Allen Jr. concluded that Opus Dei should (1) be more transparent, (2) collaborate with members of religious institutes, and (3) encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of the institution. An article published by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in March 2024 accused Opus Dei of practices akin to modern slavery. The piece draws on testimony from 16 women who served as numerary assistants over several decades in several countries. They report having been &quot;coerced into domestic servitude ... through a rigid system of psychological control&quot;.

=== Supporting views ===
According to several journalists who have worked independently on Opus Dei, such as John L. Allen Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett, Maggy Whitehouse, and Noam Friedlander, many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales. Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say that most of these myths were created by its opponents, with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practice what they preach.
Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also state that accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations stem from a clerical paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei&#x27;s lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions and do not externally represent the organization that provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have noted that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei can be found in influential clerical circles.

As to its alleged participation in right-wing politics, especially the Francoist regime, British historians Paul Preston and Brian Crozier state that the Opus Dei members who were Franco&#x27;s ministers were appointed for their talent and not for their Opus Dei membership. Also, there were notable members of Opus Dei who were vocal critics of the Franco regime such as Rafael Calvo Serer and Antonio Fontán, who was the first President of the Senate in Spain, following the adoption of a democratic Constitution. The German historian and Opus Dei member Peter Berglar calls any connection made between Opus Dei and Franco&#x27;s regime a &quot;gross slander&quot;. At the end of Franco&#x27;s regime, Opus Dei members were 50:50 for and against Franco, according to John Allen. Similarly Álvaro del Portillo, the former prelate of Opus Dei, said that any statements that Escrivá supported Hitler were &quot;a patent falsehood&quot; that were part of &quot;a slanderous campaign&quot;. He and others have stated that Escrivá condemned Hitler as a &quot;rogue&quot;, a &quot;racist&quot; and a &quot;tyrant&quot;. Opus Dei spokespersons also deny claims that Opus Dei members worked with General Pinochet. Various authors and researchers state that Escrivá was staunchly non-political, and detested dictatorships. Allen wrote that, compared with other Catholic organizations, Opus Dei&#x27;s stress on freedom and personal responsibility is extraordinarily strong. There are many Opus Dei members who are identified with center or left-wing politics, including Ruth Kelly, Jorge Rossi Chavarría, Mario Fernández Baeza, Mario Maiolo, and Jesus Estanislao.

While Opus Dei spokespersons have admitted mistakes in dealing with some members and do not, as a rule, contest their grievances, supporters have rejected generalizations merely based on negative experiences of some members. John Allen concluded that Opus Dei is not &quot;elitist&quot; in the sense in which people often invoke the term, meaning an exclusively white-collar phenomenon. He observed that among its members are barbers, bricklayers, mechanics, and fruit sellers. Most supernumeraries are living ordinary middle-class lives, he said. Regarding alleged misogyny, John Allen states that women hold half of the leadership positions in Opus Dei, and they supervise men. As regards the claim that religious people in Spain, including Opus Dei members, were involved in the abduction of children during the Franco era, an investigation found that DNA analysis of 81 cases ruled out that they were stolen babies. The supreme court of Spain did not consider the first case of stolen babies to be proven, and the chief prosecutor of the Basque Country said that &quot;not even reasonable evidence&quot; of any abduction of babies had been found, after special investigations of the police.

=== Other views ===
Sociologists Peter Berger and Samuel Huntington suggest that Opus Dei is involved in &quot;a deliberate attempt to construct an alternative modernity&quot;, one that engages modern culture while at the same time is resolutely loyal to Catholic traditions. Van Biema of &quot;Time&quot; magazine emphasises Opus Dei&#x27;s Spanish roots as a source of misunderstandings in the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggests that as the United States becomes more Hispanic, controversies about Opus Dei (and similar Catholic organizations) will decrease.

In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, argues that the relative autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced the issues raised by &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and other critics.

One of the documents of the Second Vatican Council known as the Pastoral Constitution of the Church in the Modern World provides some good context. This majority vote document elaborates upon the relationship of the Church to the world at large. Catholic Social Teaching and Christian Secularity elaborate further. In 2005, John Allen published his text about Opus Dei. In 2012, Eric Sammons published a short work, &quot;Holiness for Everyone&quot;, about the practical spirituality of St Josemaria Escriva.

<text>Mortification of the flesh is an act by which an individual or group seeks to mortify or deaden their sinful nature, as a part of the process of sanctification.

In Christianity, mortification of the flesh is undertaken in order to repent for sins and share in the Passion of Jesus. Common forms of Christian mortification that are practiced to this day include fasting, abstinence, as well as pious kneeling. Also common among Christian religious orders in the past were the wearing of sackcloth, as well as self-flagellation in imitation of Jesus Christ&#x27;s suffering and death. Christian theology holds that the Holy Spirit helps believers in the &quot;mortification of the sins of the flesh.&quot; Verses in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) considered to be precursors to Christian ideas of self-mortification include Zechariah 13:6 and 1 Kings 18:28–29.

Although the term &quot;mortification of the flesh&quot;, which is derived from the King James version of Romans 8:13 and Colossians 3:5, is primarily used in a Christian context, other cultures may have analogous concepts of self-denial; secular practices exist as well.

==Christianity==
===Etymology===
The term &quot;mortification of the flesh&quot; comes from the Book of Romans 8:13 in the New Testament: &quot;For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.&quot; The same idea is seen in other verses, such as Colossians 3:5 (&quot;Put to death what is earthly in you: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry&quot;) and Galatians 5:24 (&quot;And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires&quot;). Support for such behavior in the Old Testament is found in some verses such as Proverbs 20:30: &quot;Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.&quot;

According to Christian exegesis, &quot;deeds of the body&quot; and &quot;what is earthly&quot; refer to the &quot;wounded nature&quot; of man or his concupiscence (evil inclinations as a consequence of the Fall of Man); humanity suffers the consequences of the original sin through temptation to sin. The Apostle Paul, who authored Romans, expected believers to &quot;put to death&quot; the deeds of the flesh. The word for &#x27;flesh&#x27; in Koine Greek, the language in which the New Testament was originally written, is (), a word denoting the fallen or sinful elements, parts, and proclivities of humanity. This word is juxtaposed in Romans 8:13 with the term used for &#x27;body&#x27; (), which more strictly refers to the physical body of a human. Thus in Romans 8:13, Paul draws a parallel between fallen people, with proclivities to sin without chance of redemption, and redeemed people, who are so changed that mortification of their fleshly sin can turn to bodily life, from to .

===Forms of mortification===
In its simplest form, mortification of the flesh can mean merely denying oneself certain pleasures, such as permanently or temporarily abstaining (i.e. fasting), from meat, alcoholic beverages, sexual relations, or an area of life that makes the person&#x27;s spiritual life more difficult or burdensome. It can also be practiced by choosing a simple or even impoverished lifestyle; this is often one reason many monastics of various Christian denominations take vows of poverty. Among votarists, traditional forms of physical mortification are chain cilices and hair-shirts. In some of its more severe forms, it can mean using a discipline to flagellate oneself and a spugna to beat oneself.

===Purposes===
Mortification of the flesh is undertaken by Christians in order to repent of sins and share in the Passion of Jesus.

Through the centuries, some Christians have practiced voluntary penances as a way of imitating Jesus who, according to the New Testament, voluntarily accepted the sufferings of his passion and death on the cross at Calvary in order to redeem humankind. Some Christians note that the cross carried by Jesus is the crossbar or &quot;patibulum&quot;, a rough tree trunk, which probably weighed . Jesus also fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, an example of submission to the first person of the Trinity, God the Father, and as a way of preparing for ministry.

The early Christians mortified the flesh through martyrdom and through what has been called &quot;confession of the faith&quot;: accepting torture in a joyful way. As Christians experienced persecution, they often embraced their fate of suffering due to their love for Christ and the transformation they said they experienced from following him; these individuals became martyrs of the Christian faith. St. Jerome, a Western church father and biblical scholar who translated the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate), was famous for his severe penances in the desert and his propagation of Christian asceticism including from his base in Palestine. 

===Instruments of penance===

Christians practicing mortification of the flesh often use instruments of penance as they repent, with the purpose of being contrite and sharing in the suffering of Jesus. These include the following:
*Discipline, a scourge usually having seven tails (representing the seven deadly sins and seven virtues) for self-flagellation of the back
*Hairshirt, a garment made of camel&#x27;s hair or sackcloth worn to cause the Christian mild discomfort
*Chain cilice, a wire chain worn around the legs to cause the penitent mild discomfort
*Spugna, a round cork containing metal studs, metal spikes, or needles that is used to beat one&#x27;s chest
*Cross, which is carried in the imitation of Christ, especially in Lenten processions
===Denominational practices===

====Catholicism====
Some canonized Catholic saints and founders of Catholic religious organizations practiced mortification in order to imitate Christ. Another way of mortification that developed quickly in the early centuries was celibacy, which the Catholic tradition interprets as renouncing the joy of human marriage for a superior chastity and higher supernatural ends (cf. &quot;Works of Supererogation&quot;). for the sake of Christ.

====Lutheranism====
The Augsburg Confession of the Lutheran Church supports the practice of mortification of the flesh, stating:

In the Lutheran tradition, mortification of the flesh is not done in order to earn merit, but instead to &quot;keep the body in a condition such that it does not hinder one from doing what one has been commanded to do, according to one&#x27;s calling ().&quot; In &quot;The Ninety-Five Theses&quot;, Martin Luther stated that &quot;inner repentance is worthless unless it produces various outward mortification of the flesh.&quot; He practiced mortification of the flesh through fasting and self-flagellation, even sleeping in a stone cell without a blanket.

====Methodism====
Samuel Wesley Sr. examined the writings of Thomas à Kempis on the mortification of the flesh and concluded that &quot;mortification is still an indispensable Christian duty.&quot; His son, John Wesley, the evangelical Christian progenitor of the Methodist Church continued &quot;to hold à Kempis in high regard&quot;. As such, he likewise wrote that &quot;efforts to manifest true faith would be &#x27;quickened&#x27; by self mortification and entire obedience&quot;. Moreover, he &quot;spoke approvingly of &#x27;voluntary instances of mortification&#x27; in his journals&quot;. Methodist circuit riders were known for practicing the spiritual discipline of mortifying the flesh as they &quot;arose well before dawn for solitary prayer; they remained on their knees without food or drink or physical comforts sometimes for hours on end&quot;. John Cennick, the first Methodist itinerant preacher, prayed nine times a day, fasted and &quot;fancying dry bread too great an indulgence for so great a sinner as himself, he began to feed on potatoes, acorns, crabs, and grass&quot;. The Methodist evangelist John Wesley Childs was known for &quot;limiting what he would eat&quot; and choosing &quot;to walk beside his horse rather than to ride in order to demonstrate his willingness to suffer for his calling and to try[ing] to heighten his religious experience through subjecting himself to trials.&quot; The &quot;Wesleyan Methodist Magazine&quot; in 1813 published a statement written by Matthew Henry for Christian believers:
====Western Orthodoxy====
The Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate states that &quot;mortification of the flesh, or the putting to death of the passions which hinder attainment of the kingdom of heaven, is practiced with three disciplines of self-denial&quot;. These spiritual disciplines include &quot;unostentatious fasting or self-denial; increased prayer, by attending to worship and various devotions; and the sacrificial giving of alms (charitable donations).&quot;

====Other Christian viewpoints====
It became &quot;quite common&quot; for members of the Oxford Movement within the Anglican Communion to practice self-flagellation using a discipline. Congregationalist writer and leader within the evangelical Christian movement, Sarah Osborn, practiced self-flagellation in order &quot;to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God&quot;.
According to other evangelical Christian commentators, using Paul&#x27;s writings and other passages from the New Testament to justify the practise of mortification of the flesh is a complete misinterpretation, arguing that Paul shows a very high view of Christ&#x27;s redeeming work in the verses leading up to Colossians 1:24.

This suffering Paul refers to comes as one takes on the commission to share the gospel. Persecution and suffering such as that experienced by Christ will follow and Christians should see this suffering as a divine necessity. In chapter 9, &quot;Paul compares the evangelistic lifestyle of believers to athletes who sacrifice normal pursuits for the sake of strict training and a competitive edge&quot;. In the Corinth church there were grey areas of lifestyle and behaviors not specifically covered by the Mosaic law, and Paul was encouraging them to discipline themselves to abstain from those behaviors and practices for the sake of winning others to Christ.

==Analogous non-Christian concepts==

===Indigenous practices and shamanism===
Some indigenous cultures&#x27; shamans believe that endurance of pain or denial of appetites serves to increase spiritual power. In many indigenous cultures, painful rites are used to mark sexual maturity, marriage, procreation, or other major life stages. In Africa and Australia, indigenous people sometimes use genital mutilation on boys and girls that is intentionally painful, including circumcision, subincision, clitoridectomy, piercing, or infibulation. In some Native American tribes enduring scarification or the bites of ants are common rituals to mark a boy&#x27;s transition to adulthood. Human rights organizations in several areas of the world have protested some of these methods, which can be forced upon the participants, although some are voluntary and are a source of pride and status.

Shamans often use painful rites and self-denial such as fasting or celibacy to attain transformation, or to commune with spirits.

===Secular practices===
It has been speculated that extreme practices of mortification of the flesh may be used to obtain an altered state of consciousness to achieve spiritual experiences or visions. In modern times, members of the Church of Body Modification believe that by manipulating and modifying their bodies (by painful processes) they can strengthen the bond between their bodies and spirits, and become more spiritually aware. This group uses rites of passage from many traditions including Hinduism, Buddhism, and shamanism, to seek their aims.

In some contexts, modern practices of body modification and plastic surgery overlap with mortification. Often, secular people will undergo painful experiences in order to become more self-aware, to take control of their bodies or &quot;own&quot; them more fully, to bond with a group that is spiritual in its aims, or to overcome the body&#x27;s limitations in ways that do not refer to any higher power. Many times these rites are intended to empower the participant, rather than humble them. This represents a very different aim than many traditional mortifications.

Roland Loomis re-creates Sun Dance ceremonies and suspensions for those who believe these painful procedures expand their consciousness. Fakir Musafar explained his use of these rites as a way to awaken the spirit to the body&#x27;s limits, and put it in control of them. Others who have used these experiences to transcend physical limitations report a feeling of mastery over their physical circumstance, along with a widened perspective.

<text>Ethel Merman (born Ethel Agnes Zimmermann; January 16, 1908 – February 15, 1984) was an American actress and singer. Known for her distinctive, powerful voice, and her leading roles in musical theater, she has been called &quot;the undisputed First Lady of the musical comedy stage.&quot; She performed on Broadway in &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;

She is also known for her film roles in &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1936), &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; (1953), &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; (1954), and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963). Among many accolades, she received the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance in &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, a Grammy Award for &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and a Drama Desk Award for &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;

Merman introduced many Broadway standards, including &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; from &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot;, &quot;Some People&quot; and &quot;Rose&#x27;s Turn&quot; from &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and the Cole Porter songs &quot;It&#x27;s De-Lovely&quot; (from &quot;Red, Hot and Blue&quot;), &quot;Friendship&quot; (from &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot;), and &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot;, and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (from &quot;Anything Goes&quot;). The Irving Berlin song &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, written for &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, became Merman&#x27;s signature song.

==Early life==
Ethel Merman was born on January 16, 1908, in her maternal grandmother&#x27;s house in Astoria, Queens, but she later insisted that the year of her birth was 1912. She was an only child. Her father, Edward Zimmermann, was an accountant with James H. Dunham &amp; Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes () Zimmermann, was a schoolteacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the Dutch Reformed Church and his wife was Presbyterian. Shortly after they married, they joined the Episcopal congregation at Church of the Redeemer, where their daughter was baptized. Merman&#x27;s parents were strict about church attendance and she spent every Sunday attending morning services, Sunday school, afternoon prayer meetings, and evening study groups for children. 

Merman&#x27;s parents insisted she have an education with training in secretarial skills, in case her entertainment career failed. Merman attended P.S. 4 and William Cullen Bryant High School (which later named its auditorium in her honor), where she pursued a commercial course that offered secretarial training. 

She was active in numerous extracurricular activities, including the school magazine, the speakers&#x27; club, and student council, and she frequented the local music store to peruse the weekly arrivals of new sheet music. On Friday nights, the Zimmermann family took the subway into Manhattan to see the vaudeville show at the Palace Theatre, where Merman saw Blossom Seeley, Fanny Brice, Sophie Tucker, and Nora Bayes. At home, she tried to emulate their singing styles, but found her own distinctive voice difficult to disguise.

After graduating from Bryant High School in 1924, Merman was hired as a stenographer by the Boyce-Ite Company. One day during her lunch break, she met Vic Kliesrath, who offered her a job at the Bragg-Kliesrath Corporation for a $5 increase above the weekly $23 salary she was earning, and Merman accepted the offer. She eventually was made personal secretary to company president Caleb Bragg, whose frequent lengthy absences from the office to race automobiles allowed her to catch up on the sleep she had lost the previous night when she was out late performing at private parties. During this period, Merman began appearing in nightclubs, first hired by Jimmy Durante&#x27;s partner Lou Clayton. At this time, she decided the name Ethel Zimmermann was too long for a theater marquee. She considered combining Ethel with Gardner or Hunter, which was her grandmother&#x27;s maiden name. Her father strongly disapproved of these considerations, so she abbreviated Zimmermann to Merman to appease him.

==Career==
===Early career===
During a two-week engagement at a club in midtown Manhattan called Little Russia, Merman met agent Lou Irwin, who arranged for her to audition for Archie Mayo, a film director under contract at Warner Bros. He offered her an exclusive six-month contract, starting at $125 per week, and Merman quit her day job, only to find herself idle for weeks while waiting to be cast in a film. She urged Irwin to cancel her agreement with Mayo; instead, he negotiated her a better deal allowing her to perform in clubs while remaining on the Warner Bros.&#x27;s payroll. Merman was hired as a torch singer at Les Ambassadeurs, where the headliner was Jimmy Durante; the two became lifelong friends. She caught the attention of columnists such as Walter Winchell and Mark Hellinger, who began to give her publicity. Soon after, Merman underwent a tonsillectomy, which she feared would damage her voice, but after recovering, she discovered it was more powerful than ever.

While performing on the prestigious Keith Circuit, Merman was signed to replace Ruth Etting in the Paramount film &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; (1930), starring Ed Wynn and Ginger Rogers. Following a successful seven-week run at the Brooklyn Paramount, she was signed to perform at the Palace for $500 per week. During the run, theater producer Vinton Freedley saw her perform and invited her to audition for the role of San Francisco café singer Kate Fothergill in the new George and Ira Gershwin musical &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;. Upon hearing her sing &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, the Gershwins immediately cast her, and Merman began balancing daytime rehearsals with her matinee and evening performance schedule at the Palace. Merman introduced the songs &quot;Sam and Delilah&quot; and &quot;Boy! What Love Has Done to Me!&quot; as well as &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; in the show.

&quot;Girl Crazy&quot; opened on October 14, 1930, at the Alvin Theatre, where it ran for 272 performances. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted Merman sang &quot;with dash, authority, good voice and just the right knowing style&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called her &quot;imitative of no one.&quot; Merman was indifferent to her reviews, prompting George Gershwin to ask her mother: &quot;Have you ever seen a person so unconcerned as Ethel?&quot;

During the run of &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, Paramount signed Merman to appear in a series of 10 short musical films, most of which allowed her to sing both a rousing number and a ballad. She also performed at the Central Park Casino, the Paramount Theatre, and a return engagement at the Palace. As soon as &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; closed, her parents and she departed for a vacation in Lake George in upstate New York, but after their first day there, Merman was summoned to Atlantic City, New Jersey, to help salvage the troubled latest edition of &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;. Because she was still under contract to Freedley, White was forced to pay the producer $10,000 for her services, in addition to her weekly $1,500 salary. Following the Atlantic City run, the show played in Newark, New Jersey, and then Brooklyn before opening on Broadway, where it ran for 202 performances.

Merman&#x27;s next show, &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;, began rehearsals in August 1932 and openedand immediately closedin Pittsburgh the following month. Producer Buddy DeSylva, who also had written the book and lyrics, was certain it could be reworked into a success, and with a revamped script and additional songs by Vincent Youmans, it opened with the new title &quot;Take a Chance&quot; on November 26 at the 42nd Street Apollo Theatre, where it ran for 243 performances. Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;fast, loud, and funny&quot; and added Merman &quot;has never loosed herself with quite so much abandon.&quot; Following the Broadway run, she agreed to join the show on the road, but shortly after the Chicago opening, she claimed the chlorine in the city&#x27;s water supply was irritating her throat, and returned to Manhattan.

Merman returned to Hollywood to appear in &quot;We&#x27;re Not Dressing&quot; (1934), a screwball comedy based on the J. M. Barrie play &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;. Despite working with a cast including Bing Crosby, Carole Lombard, and Burns and Allen, under the direction of Academy Award-winning director Norman Taurog, Merman was unhappy with the experience, and she was dismayed to discover one of her musical numbers had been cut when she attended the New York opening with her family and friends. She also appeared on screen with Eddie Cantor in &quot;Kid Millions&quot; (also 1934), but her return to Broadway established her as a major star and cemented her image as a tough girl.

&quot;Anything Goes&quot; was the first of five Cole Porter musicals in which Merman starred. In addition to the title song, the score included &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot;, and &quot;Blow Gabriel Blow&quot;. It opened on November 21, 1934, at the Alvin Theatre, and the &quot;New York Post&quot; called Merman &quot;vivacious and ingratiating in her comedy moments, and the embodiment of poise and technical adroitness&quot; when singing &quot;as only she knows how to do.&quot; Although Merman always had remained with a show until the end of its run, she left &quot;Anything Goes&quot; after eight months to appear with Eddie Cantor in the film &quot;Strike Me Pink&quot; (1936). She was replaced by Benay Venuta, with whom she enjoyed a long but frequently tempestuous friendship.

Merman initially was overlooked for the film version of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1936). Bing Crosby insisted his wife Dixie Lee be cast as Reno Sweeney opposite his role as Billy Crocker, but when she unexpectedly dropped out of the project, Merman was cast in the role. From the beginning, it was clear to Merman the film would not be the enjoyable experience she had hoped it would be. The focus was shifted to Crosby, leaving her in a supporting role. Many of Porter&#x27;s ribald lyrics were altered to conform to the guidelines of the Motion Picture Production Code, and &quot;Blow Gabriel Blow&quot; was eliminated, replaced by a song, &quot;Shang Hai-de-Ho&quot;, which Merman was forced to perform in a headdress made of peacock feathers while surrounded by dancers dressed as Chinese slave girls. The film was completed $201,000 over budget and 17 days behind schedule. Richard Watts Jr. of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; described it as &quot;dull and commonplace&quot;, stating that Merman did &quot;as well as possible&quot;, but she was unable to register &quot;on screen as magnificently as she does on stage.&quot;

Merman returned to Broadway for another Porter musical, but despite the presence of Jimmy Durante and Bob Hope in the cast, &quot;Red, Hot and Blue&quot; closed after less than six months. Back in Hollywood, Merman was featured in &quot;Happy Landing&quot;, one of the top-10 box-office hits of 1938 comedy with Sonja Henie, Cesar Romero, and Don Ameche. She also starred in the box-office hit &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, a pastiche of Irving Berlin songs interpolated into a plot that vaguely paralleled the composer&#x27;s life, and &quot;Straight, Place and Show&quot;, a critical and commercial flop starring the Ritz Brothers. She returned to the stage in &quot;Stars in Your Eyes&quot;, which closed short of four months as the public flocked to the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Merman followed this with two more Porter musicals. &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot;, with Bert Lahr and Betty Grable, ran for a year, and &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;, with Betty Hutton (whose musical numbers were cut from the show on opening night at Merman&#x27;s insistence), June Allyson, and Arthur Treacher, fared even better, lasting slightly more than 14 months.

Shortly after the opening of the latter, Mermanstill despondent about the end of her affair with Stork Club owner Sherman Billingsleymarried her first husband, William Smith, Treacher&#x27;s agent. She later said she knew on their wedding night that she had made &quot;a dreadful mistake&quot;, and two months later, she filed for divorce on grounds of desertion. Shortly after, she met and married Robert D. Levitt, a promotion director for the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;. The couple eventually had two children and divorced in 1952 due to Levitt&#x27;s excessive drinking and erratic behavior.

In 1943, Merman was a featured performer in the film &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; and opened in another Porter musical, &quot;Something for the Boys&quot;, produced by Michael Todd. In 1944, she was set to star as the title character in the musical play &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; with a score by Vernon Duke and Howard Dietz, directed and produced by Rouben Mamoulian. The musical play was based on the short story &quot;Rain&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham. The serious nature of the production was a departure from Merman&#x27;s string of successful musical comedies. During rehearsals, Merman had difficulties memorizing the lyrics, and she blamed Dietz for his use of sophisticated and foreign words. She had her husband tone down some of the lyrics. Dietz took exception to Merman&#x27;s singing the altered lyrics and gave her an ultimatum to sing his original lyrics or leave the show. In response, Merman withdrew from the production. Commentators have speculated that Merman&#x27;s departure was probably due to her reluctance to assume such a serious role in her first dramatic musical. June Havoc left her starring role in &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot; and assumed the role, instead.&quot; Sadie Thompson&quot; opened on Broadway on November 16, 1944, to mixed reviews. Havoc received almost uniformly favorable reviews. Reactions to the score and the book were mixed, with the score called &quot;undistinguished.&quot; The show only lasted 60 performances and closed on January 6, 1945.

In August 1945, while in the hospital recovering from the Caesarean birth of her second child, Merman was visited by Dorothy Fields, who proposed she star as Annie Oakley in a musical her brother Herbert and she were writing with Jerome Kern. Merman accepted, but in November, Kern suffered a stroke while in New York City visiting Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein (the producers of the show) and died a few days later. Rodgers and Hammerstein invited Irving Berlin to replace Kern, and the result was &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, which opened on May 16, 1946, at the Imperial Theatre, where it ran for nearly three years and 1,147 performances. During this time, Merman took only two vacations and missed only two performances due to illness. Merman lost her role in the film version to Judy Garland (who eventually was replaced by Betty Hutton), but starred in a Broadway revival two decades later at Lincoln Center alongside Bruce Yarnell, who was cast as Frank E. Butler, Annie Oakley&#x27;s husband and manager. Yarnell was 27 years younger than Merman.

Merman and Berlin reunited for &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; in 1950, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical, and she starred in the 1953 screen adaptation as well, winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her performance. The following year, she appeared as the matriarch of the singing and dancing Donahue family in &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, a film with a score written by Berlin.

Merman returned to Broadway at the behest of her third husband, Continental Airlines executive Robert Six, who was upset she had chosen to become a housewife in Colorado following their wedding in 1953. He expected her public appearances to generate publicity for the airline, and her decision to forgo the limelight did not sit well with him. He urged her to accept the lead in &quot;Happy Hunting&quot;, with a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (who had written &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;) and a score by Harold Karr and Matt Dubey. Merman acquiesced to her husband&#x27;s demands, although she clashed with the composers from the start and soon was at odds with co-star Fernando Lamas and his wife Arlene Dahl, who frequently attended rehearsals. The show opened in New York with an advance sale of $1.5 million, and despite Merman&#x27;s dissatisfaction with it, garnered respectable reviews. Although Brooks Atkinson thought the score was &quot;hardly more than adequate&quot;, he called Merman &quot;as brassy as ever, glowing like a neon light whenever she steps on the stage.&quot; Several months into the run, she insisted that two of her least-favorite numbers be replaced by songs written by her friend Roger Edens, who, because of his exclusive contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, credited them to Kay Thompson. She lost the Tony Award to Judy Holliday in &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, and the show closed after 412 performances, with Merman happy to see what she considered &quot;a dreary obligation&quot; come to an end.

===Later career===
&quot;Gypsy&quot; was based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee and starred Merman as Rose Hovick, her domineering stage mother. The musical opened on May 21, 1959, at the Broadway Theatre. In the &quot;New York Post,&quot; Richard Watts called Merman &quot;a brilliant actress&quot;, and Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;She gives an indomitable performance, both as actress and singer.&quot; Despite the acclaim, Merman lost the Tony Award to her close friend Mary Martin in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and jokingly quipped &quot;How are you going to buck a nun?&quot; Shortly after she divorced Robert Six, his affair with television actress Audrey Meadows became public, and she found solace in her work.

Throughout the 702-performance run of &quot;Gypsy,&quot; Mervyn LeRoy saw it numerous times, repeatedly assuring Merman that he planned to cast her in the film adaptation he was preparing. Before the show&#x27;s closing, it was announced that Rosalind Russell instead had been signed to star. Russell&#x27;s husband, theater producer Frederick Brisson (whom Merman later called &quot;the lizard of Roz&quot;), had sold the screen rights to the Leonard Spigelgass play &quot;A Majority of One&quot; to Warner Bros. on the condition that his wife would star in both films. Because Russell was still a major box-office draw with the success of &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; a few years earlier, and Merman having never established herself as a popular screen presence, the studio agreed to Brisson&#x27;s terms. Merman was devastated at this turn of events and called the loss of the role &quot;the greatest professional disappointment of my life.&quot;

Following the Broadway closing of &quot;Gypsy&quot; on March 25, 1961, Merman halfheartedly embarked on the national tour. In San Francisco, she severely injured her back, but continued to perform for packed houses. During the Los Angeles run, LeRoy visited her backstage and claimed Russell was so ill that &quot;I think you&#x27;re going to end up getting this part.&quot; Believing the film version of &quot;Gypsy&quot; was within her grasp, she provided him with the many house seats he requested for friends and industry colleagues, only to discover she had been duped. Merman&#x27;s role in &quot;Gypsy&quot; earned her an estimated $130,000 per year, plus an additional 10% of the box-office receipts.

In 1963, Merman starred in the ensemble comedy film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; alongside Spencer Tracy, Sid Caesar, Jonathan Winters, Phil Silvers, Buddy Hackett, and Mickey Rooney. Merman played Mrs. Marcus, the loudmouthed mother in-law of Milton Berle. The film was a major box-office success, earning $60 million on a budget of $9.4 million and becoming the third-highest grossing film of 1963. It received six Academy Award nominations and one win.

Merman also starred in the flop &quot;The Art of Love&quot; (1965). She made dozens of television appearances on variety shows hosted by Perry Como, Red Skelton, Judy Garland, Dean Martin, Ed Sullivan, and Carol Burnett, talk shows with Mike Douglas, Dick Cavett, and Merv Griffin, and in episodes of &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, and others.

Producer David Merrick encouraged Jerry Herman to compose the score of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; specifically for Merman&#x27;s vocal range, but when he offered her the role, she declined it. She finally joined the cast on March 28, 1970, six years after the production opened. On Merman&#x27;s opening night, her performance was continually brought to a halt by prolonged standing ovations, and the critics unanimously heralded her return to the New York stage. Walter Kerr in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her voice: &quot;Exactly as trumpet-clean, exactly as penny whistle-piercing, exactly as Wurlitzer-wonderful as it always was.&quot; He wrote: &quot;Her comic sense is every bit as authoritative, as high-handed, really, as her voice.&quot; The seventh actress to portray the scheming matchmaker in the original Broadway production, she remained with the musical for 210 performances until it closed on December 27, 1970. Merman received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance for what proved to be her last appearance on Broadway.

For the remainder of her career, Merman made frequent guest apperances on television. For instance, she appeared on &quot;Match Game&quot; for seven weeks between 1975 and 1978. In 1979, she recorded &quot;The Ethel Merman Disco Album&quot;, with many of her signature songs set to a disco beat. She was a guest host on an episode in the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. Her last screen role was a self-parody in the 1980 comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot;, in which she portrayed Lieutenant Hurwitz, a shell-shocked soldier who thinks he is Ethel Merman. In the cameo appearance, Merman leaps out of bed singing &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot; as orderlies sedate her. She appeared in several episodes of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (playing Gopher&#x27;s mother), guest-starred on a CBS tribute to George Gershwin, did a summer concert tour with Carroll O&#x27;Connor, played a two-week engagement at the London Palladium, performed with Mary Martin in a concert benefiting the theater and museum collection of the Museum of the City of New York, and frequently appeared as a soloist with symphony orchestras. She also volunteered at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center (now Mount Sinai West) working in the gift shop or visiting patients.

===Performance style===
Merman was known for her powerful mezzo-soprano voice, belting, precise enunciation, and pitch. Because stage singers performed without microphones when Merman began singing professionally, she had a great advantage, despite never taking vocal lessons. Broadway lore holds that George Gershwin advised her never to take such lessons after she opened in &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;.

Caryl Flinn&#x27;s 2007 biography includes many quotes from reviews of Merman&#x27;s work, most of which were compliments to her. Brooks Atkinson summed up her talent:
==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
Merman was married and divorced four times. Her first marriage, in 1940, was to theatrical agent William Smith. They were divorced in 1941. Later that same year, Merman married newspaper executive Robert Levitt. The couple had two children: Ethel (born July 20, 1942) and Robert Jr. (born August 11, 1945). Merman and Levitt were divorced in 1952. In March 1953, Merman married Robert Six, the president of Continental Airlines. They separated in December 1959 and were divorced in 1960. According to Merman&#x27;s son, he, his sister and mother and even his elderly grandparents had suffered emotional and physical violence from Six. Merman&#x27;s fourth and final marriage was to actor Ernest Borgnine. They were married in Beverly Hills on June 27, 1964. They separated on August 7, 1964, and Borgnine filed for divorce on October 21, 1964. Merman filed a cross-complaint shortly thereafter charging Borgnine with extreme cruelty. She was granted a divorce on November 18, 1964. An oft recounted story from their short marriage demonstrated the volatility of their relationship. 
When Borgnine asked Merman how her audition had gone, she replied: &quot;Well, they were mad about my 35-year-old body, my 35-year-old voice, and my 35-year-old face.&quot;
&quot;Is that so?&quot; Borgnine responded. &quot;And what did they think of your 65-year-old cunt?&quot; 
Without missing a beat, Merman retorted: &quot;You weren’t mentioned once.&quot;

In a radio interview, Merman said of her numerous marriages: &quot;We all make mistakes. That&#x27;s why they put rubbers on pencils, and that&#x27;s what I did. I made a few lulus!&quot; In her 1978 autobiography &quot;Merman&quot;, the chapter entitled &quot;My Marriage to Ernest Borgnine&quot; was a blank page.

Ethel Levitt, her daughter, died on August 23, 1967, of a drug overdose that was ruled accidental. Her son Robert, Jr., was married to actress Barbara Colby. Colby, at the time estranged from Robert, was shot and killed (along with a friend, James Kiernan), in a parking garage in Los Angeles in July 1975. The shooting was by apparent gang members who had no clear motive.

===Profanity===
Merman was notorious for her brash demeanor and for telling vulgar stories at public parties. For instance, she once shouted a dirty joke across the room at José Ferrer during a formal reception.

While rehearsing a guest appearance on &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;, Merman exclaimed &quot;Where the hell does this go?&quot; Young, who was a devout Catholic, advanced towards Merman waving an empty coffee can, saying, &quot;Miss Merman, you said the &#x27;H&#x27; word! That&#x27;ll be twenty-five cents.&quot;—to which Merman replied, &quot;Tell me, Loretta, how much will it cost me to tell you to go fuck yourself?&quot;

===Politics===
Merman, a lifelong Republican, was a frequent guest of Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s at the White House. She was noted as saying, &quot;Eisenhower was my war hero and the President I admire and respect most.&quot; On January 20, 1981, she performed &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming up Roses&quot; at the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan. She had previously sung the same song at an inaugural gala for John F. Kennedy, but it was never broadcast.

==Autobiographies==
Merman co-wrote two memoirs. The first, &quot;Who Could Ask for Anything More?&quot; (1955), was published by Doubleday &amp; Co. and written with the assistance of Pete Martin. The second, &quot;Merman&quot; (1978), was published by Simon &amp; Schuster and written with George Eels.

==Later life and death==
Merman became forgetful with advancing age, and on occasion, had difficulty with her speech. At times, her behavior was erratic, causing concern among her friends. On April 7, 1983, she was preparing to travel to Los Angeles, to appear on the 55th Academy Awards telecast, when she collapsed in her apartment. Merman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital (Mount Sinai West), where doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke. After undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, she was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors gave Merman eight and a half months to live). The tumor caused her to become aphasic, and as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled. According to her biographer Brian Kellow, Merman&#x27;s family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public. Merman&#x27;s son, Robert, Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother&#x27;s condition because she strove to keep her personal life private. He stated, &quot;Mom truly appreciated [her fans&#x27;] presence and their applause. But you shouldn&#x27;t attempt to be personal—she drew lines, and she could cut you off.&quot;

Merman&#x27;s health eventually stabilized enough for her to be brought back to her apartment in Manhattan. On February 15, 1984, 10 months after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Merman died at her home at the age of 76. On the evening of Merman&#x27;s death, all 36 theaters on Broadway dimmed their lights at 9pm in her honor. A private funeral service for Merman was held in a chapel at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church on February 27, after which Merman was cremated at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. In accordance with her wishes, Merman&#x27;s remains were given to her son Robert Jr. Merman was interred in the Shrine of Remembrance Mausoleum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, next to her daughter Ethel.

Upon her death, Merman left an estate estimated to be worth $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to be divided between her son and two grandchildren.

On October 10, 1984, an auction of her personal effects, including furniture, artwork, and theater memorabilia, earned over $120,000 () at Christie&#x27;s East. The 56th Academy Awards, held on April 2, 1984, ended with a performance of &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; as a tribute to Merman.

<doc id="100397" wikidata="Q186807" url="?curid=100397" title="Josemaría Escrivá">
<text>Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás (born Jose María Mariano Escrivá y Albás; 9 January 1902 – 26 June 1975) was a Spanish Catholic priest who founded Opus Dei, an organization of laypeople and priests dedicated to the principle of everyday holiness. He was canonized in 2002 by Pope John Paul II, who declared Josemaría should be &quot;counted among the great witnesses of Christianity.&quot;

Escrivá gained a doctorate in civil law at the Complutense University of Madrid and a doctorate in theology at the Lateran University in Rome. His principal work was the initiation, government and expansion of Opus Dei. Escrivá&#x27;s best-known publication is &quot;The Way&quot;, which has been translated into 43 languages and has sold several million copies.

After his death, his canonization attracted considerable attention and controversy among some Catholics and the worldwide press. Several journalists who have investigated the history of Opus Dei, among them Vatican analyst John L. Allen Jr., have argued that many of these accusations are unproven or have grown from allegations by enemies of Escrivá and his organization. 

Cardinal Albino Luciani (later Pope John Paul I), Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, Óscar Romero, and many other Catholic leaders have endorsed Escrivá&#x27;s teaching concerning the universal call to holiness, the role of the laity, and the sanctifying effect of ordinary work. According to Allen, among Catholics, Escrivá is &quot;reviled by some and venerated by millions more&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===

José María Mariano Escrivá y Albás was born to José Escrivá y Corzán and his wife, María de los Dolores Albás y Blanc on 9 January 1902, in the small town of Barbastro, in Huesca, Spain, the second of six children and the first of two sons. José Escrivá was a merchant and a partner in a textile company that eventually went bankrupt, forcing the family to relocate in 1915 to the city of Logroño, in the northern province of La Rioja, where he worked as a clerk in a clothing store. Young Josemaría first felt that &quot;he had been chosen for something&quot;, it is reported, when he saw footprints left in the snow by a monk walking barefoot.

With his father&#x27;s blessing, Escrivá prepared to become a priest of the Catholic Church. He studied first in Logroño and then in Zaragoza, where he was ordained as deacon on Saturday, 20 December 1924. He was ordained a priest, also in Zaragoza, on Saturday, 28 March 1925. After a brief appointment to a rural parish in Perdiguera, he went to Madrid, the Spanish capital, in 1927 to study law at the Central University. In Madrid, Escrivá was employed as a private tutor and as a chaplain to the Foundation of Santa Isabel, which comprised the royal Convent of Santa Isabel and a school managed by the Little Sisters of the Assumption.

===Mission as the founder of Opus Dei===
A prayerful retreat helped him to discern more definitely what he considered to be God&#x27;s will for him, and, on 2 October 1928, he &quot;saw&quot; Opus Dei (), a way by which Catholics might learn to sanctify themselves by their secular work. He founded it in 1928, and Pius XII gave it final approval in 1950. According to the decree of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which contains a condensed biography of Escrivá, &quot;[t]o this mission he gave himself totally. From the beginning his was a very wide-ranging apostolate in social environments of all kinds. He worked especially among the poor and the sick languishing in the slums and hospitals of Madrid.&quot;

During the Spanish Civil War, Escrivá fled from Madrid, which was controlled by the anti-clerical Republicans, via Andorra and France, to the city of Burgos, which was the headquarters of General Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalist forces. After the war ended in 1939 with Franco&#x27;s victory, Escrivá was able to resume his studies in Madrid and complete a doctorate in law, for which he submitted a thesis on the historical jurisdiction of the Abbess of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas.

The Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, affiliated with Opus Dei, was founded on Sunday, 14 February 1943. Escrivá relocated to Rome in 1946. The decree declaring Escrivá &quot;Venerable&quot; states that &quot;in 1947 and on Monday, 16 June 1950, he obtained approval of Opus Dei as an institution of pontifical right. With tireless charity and operative hope he guided the development of Opus Dei throughout the world, activating a vast mobilization of lay people ... He gave life to numerous initiatives in the work of evangelization and human welfare; he fostered vocations to the priesthood and the religious life everywhere... Above all, he devoted himself tirelessly to the task of forming the members of Opus Dei.&quot;

===Later years===
According to some accounts, at the age of two he suffered from a disease (perhaps epilepsy) so severe that the doctors expected him to die soon, but his mother had taken him to Torreciudad, where the Aragonese locals venerated a statue of the Virgin Mary (as &quot;Our Lady of the Angels&quot;), thought to date from the 11th century. Escrivá recovered and, as the director of Opus Dei during the 1960s and 1970s, promoted and oversaw the design and construction of a major shrine at Torreciudad. The new shrine was inaugurated on 7 July 1975, soon after Escrivá&#x27;s death, and to this day remains the spiritual center of Opus Dei, as well as an important destination for pilgrimage. By the time of Escrivá&#x27;s death in 1975, the members of Opus Dei numbered some 60,000 in 80 countries. As an adult, Escrivá suffered from type 1 diabetes and, according to some sources, also epilepsy.

In 1950, Escrivá was appointed an Honorary Domestic Prelate by Pope Pius XII, which allowed him to use the title of Monsignor. In 1955, he received a doctorate of theology from the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. He was a consultor to two Vatican congregations (the Congregation for Seminaries and Universities and the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law) and an honorary member of the Pontifical Academy of Theology. The Second Vatican Council (1962–65) confirmed the importance of the universal call to holiness, the role of the laity, and the Mass as the basis of Christian life.

In 1948 Escrivá founded the Collegium Romanum Sanctae Crucis (Roman College of the Holy Cross), Opus Dei&#x27;s educational center for men, in Rome. In 1953 he founded the Collegium Romanum Sanctae Mariae (Roman College of Saint Mary) to serve the women&#x27;s section (these institutions are now joined into the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross.) Escrivá also established the University of Navarre, in Pamplona, and the University of Piura (in Peru), as secular institutions affiliated with Opus Dei.

Escrivá died of cardiac arrest on 26 June 1975, aged 73.

Three years after Escrivá died, the then Cardinal Albino Luciani (later Pope John Paul I) celebrated the originality of his contribution to Christian spirituality.

==Personality and attitudes==

===Attitudes in general===
One of the persons who knew Escrivá best was the Bishop of Madrid, where Opus Dei was initiated, Bishop Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, for Escrivá would visit and report to him quite frequently and the two established a very strong friendship. In a 1943 report to Rome, the bishop stated: &quot;The distinctive notes of his character are his energy and his capacity for organization and government; with an ability to pass unnoticed. He has shown himself most obedient to the Church hierarchy -- one very special hallmark of his priestly work is the way he fosters, in speech and in writing, in public and in private, love for Holy Mother Church and for the Roman Pontiff.&quot; Bishop Eijo y Garay wrote to the Jesuit Provincial of Toledo, Carlos Gomez Martinho, S.J. in 1941: &quot;Fr. Escrivá is an exemplary priest, chosen by God for apostolic enterprises; humble, prudent, self-sacrificing in work, docile to his bishop, of outstanding intelligence and with a very solid spiritual and doctrinal formation.&quot; Eijo y Garay told an officer of the Falange that &quot;[T]o think that Fr. Josemaría Escrivá is capable of creating anything secret is absurd. He is as frank and open as a child!&quot; 

Viktor Frankl, an Austrian psychiatrist and neurologist, founder of &quot;logotherapy&quot;, and a Nazi concentration camp survivor, met Escrivá in Rome in 1970 and later wrote of &quot;the refreshing serenity which emanated from him and warmed the whole conversation&quot;, and &quot;the unbelievable rhythm&quot; with which his thought flowed, and finally &quot;his amazing capacity&quot; for getting into &quot;immediate contact&quot; with those with whom he was speaking. Frankl went on: &quot;Escrivá evidently lived totally in the present moment, he opened out to it completely, and gave himself entirely to it.&quot;

According to Álvaro del Portillo, who was Escrivá&#x27;s closest collaborator for many years, there was one basic quality of Escrivá &quot;that pervaded everything else: his dedication to God, and to all souls for God&#x27;s sake; his constant readiness to correspond generously to the will of God.&quot; Pope Paul VI summarized his opinion of what he termed the &quot;extraordinariness&quot; of Escrivá&#x27;s sanctity in this way: &quot;He is one of those men who has received the most charisms (supernatural gifts) and have corresponded most generously to them.&quot;

&quot;The first impression one gets from watching Escrivá &#x27;live&#x27;&quot;, John L. Allen Jr. writes after watching some movies on the founder of Opus Dei in 2005, &quot;is his effervescence, his keen sense of humor. He cracks jokes, makes faces, roams the stage, and generally leaves his audience in stitches in off-the-cuff responses to questions from people in the crowd.&quot;

Critics, such as Spanish architect Miguel Fisac, who was one of the earliest members of Opus Dei and who associated with Escrivá for nearly twenty years before ending his relation with Escrivá and Opus Dei, have given a very different description of Escrivá as a pious but vain, secretive, and ambitious man, given to private displays of violent temper, and who demonstrated little charity towards others or genuine concern for the poor. According to British journalist Giles Tremlett, &quot;biographies of Escrivá have produced conflicting visions of the saint as either a loving, caring charismatic person or a mean-spirited, manipulative egoist&quot;. French historian Édouard de Blaye has referred to Escrivá as a &quot;mixture of mysticism and ambition&quot;.

===Towards God===
====Prayer====
On the centennial of Escrivá&#x27;s birthday, Cardinal Ratzinger (who became Pope Benedict XVI) commented: &quot;I have always been impressed by Josemaría Escrivá&#x27;s explanation of the name &#x27;Opus Dei&#x27;: an explanation ... gives us an idea of the founder&#x27;s spiritual profile. Escrivá knew he had to found something, but he was also conscious that what he was founding was not his own work, that he himself did not invent anything and that the Lord was merely making use of him. So it was not his work, but Opus Dei (God&#x27;s Work). [This] gives us to understand that he was in a permanent dialogue, a real contact with the One who created us and works for us and with us... If therefore St Josemaría speaks of the common vocation to holiness, it seems to me that he is basically drawing on his own personal experience, not of having done incredible things himself, but of having let God work. Therefore a renewal, a force for good was born in the world even if human weaknesses will always remain.&quot;

In his canonization homily, Pope John Paul II described Escrivá as &quot;a master in the practice of prayer, which he considered to be an extraordinary &#x27;weapon&#x27; to redeem the world...It is not a paradox but a perennial truth; the fruitfulness of the apostolate lies above all in prayer and in intense and constant sacramental life.&quot; In John Paul II&#x27;s &quot;Decree of Canonization&quot;, he refers to the five brief prayers or aspirations of Escrivá through which &quot;one can trace the entire life story of Blessed Josemaría Escrivá. He was barely sixteen when he began to recite the first two aspirations [&quot;Domine, ut videam!&quot;, Lord, that I might see! and &quot;Domina, ut sit!&quot;, Lady, that it might be!], as soon as he had the first inklings of God&#x27;s call. They expressed the burning desire of his heart: to see what God was asking of him, so that he might do it without delay, lovingly fulfilling the Lord&#x27;s will. The third aspiration [&quot;Omnes cum Petro ad Iesum per Mariam!&quot;, All together with Peter to Jesus through Mary!] appears frequently in his writings as a young priest and shows how his zeal to win souls for God went hand in hand with both a firm determination to be faithful to the Church and an ardent devotion to Mary, the Virgin Mother of God. &quot;Regnare Christum volumus!&quot; We want Christ to reign!: these words aptly express his constant pastoral concern to spread among all men and women the call to share, through Christ, in the dignity of God&#x27;s children. God&#x27;s sons and daughters should live for the purpose, to serve Him alone: &quot;Deo omnis gloria!&quot; All the glory to God!&quot;

During the thanksgiving Mass for the canonization of St. Josemaría, John Paul II, said: &quot;In the Founder of Opus Dei, there is an extraordinary love for the will of God. There exists a sure criterion of holiness: fidelity in accomplishing the divine will down to the last consequences. For each one of us the Lord has a plan, to each he entrusts a mission on earth. The saint could not even conceive of himself outside of God&#x27;s plan. He lived only to achieve it. St Josemaría was chosen by the Lord to announce the universal call to holiness and to point out that daily life and ordinary activities are a path to holiness. One could say that he was the saint of ordinary life.&quot;

Not all Catholic commentators, however, were impressed equally by Escrivá&#x27;s spirituality. For instance, the Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar wrote in an article of 1963 that Escrivá&#x27;s &quot;The Way&quot; provided an &quot;insufficient spirituality&quot; to sustain a religious organization and that the book was hardly more than &quot;a little Spanish manual for advanced Boy Scouts&quot;. Von Balthasar also questioned the attitudes towards prayer described by &quot;The Way&quot;, declaring that Escrivá&#x27;s use of prayer 
Von Balthasar repeated his negative evaluation of &quot;The Way&quot; in a television interview from 1984.

Similar criticism of Escrivá&#x27;s spirituality has been stated by other commentators: for instance, according to Kenneth L. Woodward, a journalist who specializes in articles about the Catholic Church, &quot;to judge by his writings alone, Escrivá&#x27;s was an unexceptional spirit, derivative and often banal in his thoughts, personally inspiring, perhaps, but devoid of original insights&quot;, whose book &quot;The Way&quot; reveals &quot;a remarkable narrowness of mind, weariness of human sexuality, and artlessness of expression.&quot;

====Towards the liturgy====
Escrivá conceived the Mass as the &quot;Source and summit of the Christian&#x27;s interior life,&quot; a terminology which was later used by the Second Vatican Council. Escrivá strove to obey whatever was indicated by the competent authority regarding the celebration of Mass and &quot;[h]e took all necessary steps to ensure that the prescriptions of Vatican II, notably in the area of the liturgy, were applied within Opus Dei.&quot; As his prayer was much integrated with traditional liturgy, Escrivá found the transition difficult and asked Echevarría to help him with respect to the new rites. Although he missed the practices of the old rites, especially some gestures such as the kissing of the paten (a small plate, usually made of silver or gold, used to hold the Eucharist), he prohibited his devotees to ask for any dispensation for him &quot;out of a spirit of obedience to ecclesiastical norms... He has decided to show his love for the liturgy through the new rite&quot;, commented Echevarría. However, when Annibale Bugnini, Secretary of the Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy, learned of Escrivá&#x27;s difficulties, he granted Escrivá the possibility of celebrating the Mass using the old rite. Whenever Escrivá celebrated this rite, he did so only in the presence of one Mass server.

Vladimir Felzmann, a priest who worked as Escrivá&#x27;s personal assistant before quitting Opus Dei in 1981, stated in an interview for &quot;Newsweek&quot; that Escrivá was so distraught by the reforms introduced by the Second Vatican Council that he and his deputy, Álvaro del Portillo, &quot;went to Greece in 1967 to see if [they] could bring Opus Dei into the Greek Orthodox Church. Escrivá thought the [Catholic] church was a shambles and that the Orthodox might be the salvation of himself and of Opus Dei as the faithful remnant.&quot; Felzmann says that Escrivá soon abandoned those plans as impracticable. Flavio Capucci, a member of Opus Dei and the postulator of the cause for Escrivá&#x27;s canonization, denies that Escrivá ever contemplated quitting the Catholic Church. This was also denied by the information office of Opus Dei, which stated that Escrivá&#x27;s visit to Greece in 1966 was done in order to analyze the convenience of organizing Opus Dei in that country, and that Escrivá even brought back icons as presents for Pope Paul VI and Angelo Dell&#x27;Acqua (then the substitute to the Vatican Secretary of State), whom he had informed of the visit beforehand.

====Mortification====
Escrivá taught that &quot;joy has its roots in the form of a cross&quot;, and that &quot;suffering is the touchstone of love&quot;, convictions which were represented in his own life. He practiced corporal mortification personally and recommended it to others in Opus Dei. In particular, his enthusiasm for the practice of self-flagellation has attracted controversy, with critics quoting testimonies about Escrivá whipping himself furiously until the walls of his cubicle were speckled with blood. Both the practice of self-mortification as a form of penance, and the conviction that suffering can help a person to acquire sanctity, have ample precedent in Catholic teaching and practice. Referring to Escrivá, John Paul II stated in &quot;Christifideles omnes&quot;:

===Towards the Virgin Mary===

Pope John Paul II stated on Sunday, 6 October 2002, after the Angelus greetings: &quot;Love for our Lady is a constant characteristic of the life of Josemaría Escrivá and is an eminent part of the legacy that he left to his spiritual sons and daughters.&quot; The Pope also said that &quot;St. Josemaría wrote a beautiful small book called &quot;The Holy Rosary&quot; which presents spiritual childhood, a real disposition of spirit of those who wish to attain total abandonment to the divine will&quot;.

When Escrivá was 10 or 11 years old, he already had the habit of carrying the rosary in his pocket. As a priest, he would ordinarily end his homilies and his personal prayer with a conversation with the Blessed Virgin. He instructed that all rooms in the offices of Opus Dei should have an image of the Virgin. He encouraged his spiritual children to greet these images when they entered a room. He encouraged a Marian apostolate, preaching that &quot;To Jesus we go and to Him we return through Mary&quot;. While looking at a picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe giving a rose to San Juan Diego, he commented: &quot;I would like to die that way.&quot; On 26 June 1975, after entering his work room, which had a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, he slumped on the floor and died.

===Towards people===
&quot;Escrivá de Balaguer was a very human saint&quot;, preached John Paul II. &quot;All those who met him, whatever their culture or social status, felt he was a father, totally devoted to serving others, for he was convinced that every soul is a marvellous treasure; indeed, every person is worth all of Christ&#x27;s Blood. This attitude of service is obvious in his dedication to his priestly ministry and in the magnanimity with which he started so many works of evangelization and human advancement for the poorest persons.&quot;

Former numerary María del Carmen Tapia (born 1925), who worked with Escrivá for 18 years inside the organization, seven as his secretary, wrote in her book, &quot;Beyond the Threshold: A Life in Opus Dei&quot;, that Escrivá often became angry, and that as secretary in charge of recording his words and actions, she was not allowed to record anything negative that she witnessed. She stated she was subjected to abusive words from Escrivá, who called her filthy names, and then screamed during this meeting with both men and women present, upbraiding a member who helped Tapia send letters. She was kept prisoner in the headquarters of Opus Dei in Rome from November 1965 until March 1966. &quot;I was held completely deprived of any outside contact with the absolute prohibition to go out for any reason or receive or make telephone calls or to write or receive letters. Nor could I go out for the so-called weekly walk or the monthly excursion. I was a prisoner.&quot;

However, some of his devotees say that, through him, Opus Dei has been able to better the quality of life of many women, and refer to his respect for women and his interest in improving their lives. Historian Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, a Catholic convert, asserted that &quot;Opus Dei has an enviable record of educating the poor and supporting women, whether single or married, in any occupation they choose.&quot;

===Towards his family===
Opus Dei&#x27;s founder modified his name in several ways over the course of his life. In the church records of the cathedral at Barbastro, he appears as having been baptized four days after birth with the name José María Julián Mariano, and his surname was spelled Escriba. As early as his school days, José Escrivá had &quot;adopted the rather more distinguished version spelled with a &quot;v&quot; rather than a &quot;b.&quot; His name is spelled Escrivá in the memento of his first Mass. According to critics like Luis Carandell and Michael Walsh a former Jesuit priest, he also adopted the use of the conjunction &quot;y&quot; (&quot;and&quot;) joining his father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s surnames (&quot;Escrivá y Albás&quot;), a usage which he says is associated with aristocratic families, even though that has been the legal naming format in Spain since 1870.

On 16 June 1940, the Spanish &quot;Boletín Oficial del Estado&quot; (&quot;Official State Bulletin&quot;) records that Escrivá requested of the government that he be permitted to change his &quot;first surname so that it will be written Escrivá de Balaguer&quot;. He justified the petition on the grounds that &quot;the name Escrivá is common in the east coast and in Catalonia, leading to harmful and annoying confusion&quot;. On 20 June 1943, when he was 41 years old, the registry book of the Barbastro cathedral and the baptismal certificate of José María were annotated to represent &quot;that the surname Escriba was changed to Escrivá de Balaguer&quot;. Balaguer is the name of the town in Catalonia from which Escrivá&#x27;s paternal family derived.

One of the earliest members of Opus Dei, and a friend for many years, the architect Miguel Fisac, who later quit Opus Dei, said that Escrivá found it embarrassing to have his father&#x27;s family name since his father&#x27;s company became bankrupt, that he had a &quot;great affection for the aristocracy&quot;, and that, when Escrivá was a chaplain at the Foundation of Santa Isabel in Madrid, he would often meet aristocratic visitors who would ask, upon learning that his name was Escrivá, whether he belonged to the noble Escrivá de Romaní family, only to ignore him when they learned that he did not. According to Vásquez de Prada, a writer, Opus Dei member, and official biographer who produced a three-volume biography of Escrivá, the act had nothing to do with ambition but was motivated rather by fairness and loyalty to his family. The main problem is that in Spanish the letters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are pronounced in the same way and therefore bureaucrats and clerics had made mistakes in transcribing the Escrivá family name in some official documents throughout the generations. Defenders of Escrivá have also argued that the addition of &quot;de Balaguer&quot; corresponded to a practice adopted by many Spanish families that felt a need to distinguish themselves from others with the same surname but proceeding from different regions and consequently having different histories.

Escrivá&#x27;s younger brother Santiago stated that his brother &quot;loved the members of his family&quot; and took good care of them. When their father died, he says, Escrivá told their mother that &quot;she should stay calm, because he will always take care of us. And he fulfilled this promise.&quot; Escrivá would find time in his busy schedule to chat and take a walk with his younger brother, acting like a father towards him. When the family transferred to Madrid, he obeyed the instructions of their father that he obtain a doctorate in Law. &quot;Thanks to his docility to this advice&quot;, says Santiago, &quot;he was able to support the family by giving classes in Law, and with this he acquired a juridical mentality ... which would later be so necessary to do Opus Dei.&quot; Escrivá also modified his first name. From José María, he changed it to the original Josemaría. Biographers state, that around 1935 [age 33], &quot;he joined his first two names because his single love for the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph were equally inseparable&quot;.

===Towards his country===
Many of his contemporaries recount the tendency of Escrivá to preach about patriotism as opposed to nationalism.

Critics have alleged that Escrivá personally, as well as the organization of Opus Dei, were associated originally with the ideology of &quot;National Catholicism&quot;, particularly during the Spanish Civil War and the years immediately after it, and that they were therefore also closely associated with the authoritarian regime of General Franco. According to Catalan sociologist Joan Estruch:

Estruch cites, for instance, the fact that the first edition of Escrivá&#x27;s &quot;The Way&quot;, finished in Burgos and published in Valencia in 1939, had the dateline &quot;Año de la Victoria&quot; (&quot;Year of the Victory&quot;), referring to Franco&#x27;s military triumph over the Republican forces in the civil war, as well as a prologue by a pro-Franco bishop, Xavier Lauzurica, which ended with the admonition to the reader to &quot;always stay vigilant and alert, because the enemy does not sleep. If you make these maxims your life, you will be a perfect imitator of Jesus Christ and a gentleman without blemish. And with Christs like you Spain will return to the old grandeur of its saints, wise men, and heroes.&quot; Escrivá preached personally to General Franco and his family during a week-long spiritual retreat at the Pardo Palace (Franco&#x27;s official residence) in April 1946.

Vittorio Messori says that the ties between Escrivá and Francoism are part of a black legend propagated against Escrivá and Opus Dei. Allen states that based on his research Escrivá could not be said to be &quot;pro-Franco&quot; (for which he was criticized for not joining other Catholics in openly praising Franco) nor &quot;anti-Franco&quot; (for which he was criticized for not being &quot;pro-democracy&quot;). According to Allen, there is no statement from Escrivá for or against Franco. Escrivá&#x27;s devotees and some historians have emphasized his personal effort to avoid partiality in politics. Professor Peter Berglar, a German historian, asserts that Franco&#x27;s falangists suspected Escrivá of &quot;internationalism, anti-Spainism and Freemasonry&quot; and that during &quot;the first decade of Franco&#x27;s regime, Opus Dei and Escrivá were attacked with perseverance bordering on fanaticism, not by enemies, but by supporters of the new Spanish State. Escrivá was even reported to the &quot;Tribunal for the Fight against Freemasonry&quot;&quot;.

===Awards and honors===
Escrivá received several awards:
*The Grand Cross of Alfonso X the Wise (1951)
*The Gold Cross of St. Raymond of Penyafort (1954)
*The Grand Cross of Isabella the Catholic (1956)
*The Grand Cross of Charles III (1960)
*Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of Zaragoza (Spain, 1960)
*The Gold Medal by the City council of Barbastro (1975).

Some biographers have said that Escrivá did not seek these awards, that they were nevertheless granted to him, that he accepted them due to charity to those who were granting these, and that he did not give the slightest importance to these awards. Journalist Luis Carandell, however, recounts testimonies about how members of Opus Dei paid for the insignia of the Grand Cross of Charles III to be made from gold, only to have Escrivá angrily reject it and demand instead one encrusted with diamonds. Carandell holds that this episode was part of a larger pattern in Escrivá&#x27;s life of ambition for social prestige and the trappings of wealth. Sympathetic biographers, however, insist that Escrivá taught that material things are good, but that people should not get attached to them and should serve only God. It is reported that he declared that &quot;he has most who needs least&quot; and that it took only 10 minutes to gather his possessions after his death.

==Controversies==
In addition to the questions raised about the depth of Escrivá&#x27;s spirituality and theological thinking, his purported habits of secretiveness and elitism (although for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle-to-low levels of society, in terms of education, income and social status), his alleged bad temper and ambition for social status and worldly luxuries, several other specific aspects of Escrivá&#x27;s life and work have generated some criticism, particularly regarding his canonization by the Catholic Church. The sources of criticism include his alleged private statements in defence of Adolf Hitler, collaboration by members of Opus Dei with right-wing political causes (especially during General Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship in Spain), Escrivá&#x27;s request for the rehabilitation in his favour of an aristocratic title and allegations that he maintained bad relations with other Catholic officials, of whom he could be very critical in private.

===Alleged defence of Hitler===
During Escrivá&#x27;s beatification process, Vladimir Felzmann, who had been Escrivá&#x27;s personal assistant before Felzmann quit Opus Dei and became a priest of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster and an aide to Cardinal Basil Hume, sent several letters to Flavio Capucci, the postulator (i.e., chief promoter) of Escrivá&#x27;s cause. In his letters, Felzmann wrote that in 1967 or 1968, during the intermission to a World War II movie, Escrivá had said to him, &quot;Vlad, Hitler couldn&#x27;t have been such a bad person. He couldn&#x27;t have killed six million. It couldn&#x27;t have been more than four million&quot;. Felzmann later explained that those remarks should be regarded in the context of Catholic anticommunism in Spain, emphasizing that in 1941 all of the male members of Opus Dei, who then numbered about fifty, offered to join the &quot;Blue Division&quot;, a group of Spaniard volunteers who joined the German forces in their fight against the Soviet Army, along the Eastern Front. Another phrase that has been attributed to Escrivá by some of his critics is &quot;Hitler against the Jews, Hitler against the Slavs, means Hitler against Communism&quot;.

Álvaro del Portillo, who succeeded Escrivá as the director of Opus Dei, declared that any claims that Escrivá endorsed Hitler were &quot;a patent falsehood&quot; and part of &quot;a slanderous campaign&quot;. He and others have stated that Escrivá regarded Hitler as a &quot;pagan&quot;, a &quot;racist&quot; and a &quot;tyrant&quot; (see Opus Dei and politics).

===Alleged support for right-wing leaders===
One of the most controversial accusations against Escrivá is that he and Opus Dei were active in bolstering far-right regimes, especially the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco in Spain. After 1957, several members of Opus Dei served as ministers in Franco&#x27;s government. In particular, the &quot;technocrats&quot; most associated with the &quot;Spanish miracle&quot; of the 1960s were members of Opus Dei: Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, Gregorio López-Bravo, Laureano López Rodó, Juan José Espinosa, and Faustino García-Moncó. Most of these &quot;technocrats&quot; entered the government under the patronage of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco who, though not a member of Opus Dei himself, was reportedly sympathetic to the organization and its values and who, as Franco grew older and more frail, increasingly came to exercise the day-to-day control of the Spanish government.

According to journalist Luis Carandell, when Ullastres and Navarro Rubio were first appointed to the government in 1957, Escrivá gleefully exclaimed &quot;They have made us ministers!&quot; something which Opus Dei has officially denied. On 23 May 1958, Escrivá sent a letter to Franco, which said, in part:

In 1963, Swiss Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar wrote a scathing critique of Escrivá&#x27;s spirituality, characterizing Escrivá&#x27;s approach to religion as a form of &quot;integrism&quot;, stating &quot;despite the affirmations of the members of Opus Dei that they are free in their political options, it is undeniable that its foundation is marked by Francoism, that that is the &#x27;law within which it has been formed&#x27;&quot;. In another essay, published the following year, von Balthasar characterized Opus Dei as &quot;an integrist concentration of power within the Church&quot;, explaining that the main objective of integrism is &quot;imposing the spiritual with worldly means&quot;.

In 1979, von Balthasar distanced himself from a newspaper attack on Opus Dei which had cited his earlier accusations of integrism. He wrote in a personal letter to the Prelature, sent also to the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot;, that &quot;because of my lack of concrete information, I am not able to give an informed opinion about Opus Dei today. On the other hand, one thing strikes me as obvious: many of the criticisms levelled against the movement, including those of your own journal concerning the religious instruction given by Opus Dei members, seem to me to be false and anti-clerical.&quot; Von Balthasar maintained his unfavourable judgment of Escrivá&#x27;s spirituality and repeated it in a television interview in 1984, but he did not renew his criticism of Opus Dei as an organization. In 1988, von Balthasar was named as a cardinal by Pope John Paul II, but he died before he could be elevated to that position at the next consistory.

In response to the accusations of &quot;integrism&quot;, Escrivá declared that, &quot;Opus Dei is neither on the left nor on the right nor in the centre&quot; and that &quot;as regards religious liberty, from its foundation Opus Dei has never practised discrimination of any kind.&quot; Opus Dei officials state that individual members are free to choose any political affiliation, emphasizing that among its members were also two important figures in the monarchist political opposition of the 1970s in Spain: the writer Rafael Calvo Serer, who was forced into exile by Franco&#x27;s regime, and the journalist Antonio Fontán, who became the first president of the Senate after the transition to democracy.

John Allen has written that Escrivá was neither anti-Franco nor pro-Franco. Some critics of Opus Dei, such as Miguel Fisac and Damian Thompson, have argued that the group has always sought &quot;advancement not only of its message but also of its interests&quot;, and that it has consistently courted those with power and influence, without maintaining a coherent political ideology.

The alleged involvement of Opus Dei in Latin American politics has also been a topic of controversy. According to US journalist Penny Lernoux, the 1966 military coup in Argentina happened soon after its leader, General Juan Carlos Onganía, attended a spiritual retreat sponsored by Opus Dei. During his 1974 visit to Latin America, Escrivá visited Chile, only nine months after the coup d&#x27;état in Chile that deposed the elected Marxist president Salvador Allende and installed a right-wing military dictatorship under General Augusto Pinochet. Escrivá declined an invitation to visit personally with the Chilean government junta, alleging that he was ill with influenza, but in his letter to the members of the junta he added that he wished &quot;to let you know how much I pray, have prayed, and have gotten others to pray, for this great nation, especially when it found itself menaced by the scourge of the Marxist heresy.&quot;

Critics have charged that Opus Dei members supported Pinochet&#x27;s coup and then had a role in the &quot;Miracle of Chile&quot; of the 1980s similar to that of the &quot;technocrats&quot; during the Spanish Miracle of the 1960s. However, among the major right-wing politicians, only Joaquín Lavín (who did not occupy public office under Pinochet) has been unequivocally identified as a member of Opus Dei. Another member of Opus Dei, Jorge Sabag Villalobos, belongs to a centre-left party that opposed Pinochet&#x27;s regime. Peter Berglar, a German historian and member of Opus Dei, has written that connecting Opus Dei with fascist regimes is a &quot;gross slander&quot;. Journalist Noam Friedlander states that allegations about Opus Dei involvement with the Pinochet regime are &quot;unproven tales.&quot; Several of Escrivá&#x27;s collaborators stated that he actually despised dictatorships.

Escrivá&#x27;s visit to Chile and the subsequent spread of Opus Dei in the country has been identified by some historians as one strand of a wider phenomenon of influence from Francoist Spain in Chile.

===Title of nobility===
Another source of controversy about Escrivá was the fact that, in 1968, he requested and received from the Spanish Ministry of Justice the rehabilitation in his favor of the aristocratic title of Marquess of Peralta. According to the official &quot;Guía de grandezas y títulos del reino&quot; (&quot;Guide to the grandeeships and titles of the realm&quot;), the title of Marquess had originally been granted in 1718 to Tomás de Peralta, minister of state, justice and war for the Kingdom of Naples, by Archduke Charles of Austria. Until 1715, Archduke Charles had been, as &quot;Charles III&quot;, a pretender to the Spanish throne (&quot;see&quot; War of Spanish Succession), and from 1711 until 1740 he ruled as Holy Roman Emperor and King of Naples.

Escrivá&#x27;s successful petition of a title of nobility has aroused controversy not only because it might seem at odds with the humility befitting a Catholic priest, but also because the same title of Marquess of Peralta had been rehabilitated in 1883 by Pope Leo XIII and King Alfonso XII in favor of a man to whom Escrivá had no male-line family association: the Costa Rican diplomat Manuel María de Peralta y Alfaro (1847–1930). On that occasion, the documents ordering the rehabilitation stated that the original title had been granted in 1738 (not 1718) to Juan Tomás de Peralta y Franco de Medina, by Charles of Austria in his capacity as Holy Roman Emperor, not as pretender to the Spanish throne. Ambassador Peralta, who in 1884 had married a Belgian countess, Jehanne de Clérembault, died without children in 1930. None of his kinsmen in Costa Rica requested the transmission of the marquessate, but one of them has published an extensive genealogical study that would seem to contradict any claim by Escrivá to the title.

Escrivá did not publicly use the title of Marquess of Peralta and finally ceded it to his brother Santiago in 1972. Santiago said of the request to rehabilitate the title that &quot;the decision was heroic because [Josemaría] knew that he would be vilified as a result... Josemaría did what is best for me. After the right amount of time had passed, without making use of the title (in fact he never had the intention of using it), he passed the title on to me.&quot; The argument that Mons. Escrivá had originally requested the rehabilitation of the title as a favor to his family and with the intention of ceding it to his brother seems belied by the fact that, in 1968, Santiago had requested for himself the rehabilitation of a different title of nobility, the barony of San Felipe, which was not granted. According to historian Ricardo de la Cierva (a former Minister of Culture in the Spanish government) and to architect Miguel Fisac (who had been close to Escrivá and member of Opus Dei from 1936 until his departure in 1955), Escrivá&#x27;s request for the title might have been part of an unsuccessful attempt to take control of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), a Catholic religious order which required its leading members to be of noble birth and to which his deputy in Opus Dei, Álvaro del Portillo, already belonged. According to de la Cierva, &quot;Monsignor Escrivá&#x27;s desire for a marquessate is not to my liking but seems to me, given his idiosyncrasies, comprehensible and even forgivable. That the title should have been based on a falsification seems to me extremely sad and even extremely grave.&quot;

===Relations with other Catholic leaders===
Pauline priest Giancarlo Rocca, a church historian and a professor at the &quot;Claretianum&quot; in Rome, says that Escrivá actively sought the rank of bishop but was twice refused by the Vatican curia, first in 1945, and later in 1950 (when he and his followers had lobbied for his appointment as bishop of Vitoria). According to Rocca, in both instances the curial officials expressed concerns about the organization of Opus Dei and about the psychological profile of Escrivá.

Sociologist Alberto Moncada, a former member of Opus Dei, has collected and published various oral testimonies about Escrivá&#x27;s strained relations with other officials of the Catholic Church. In particular, Moncada quotes Antonio Pérez-Tenessa, who at the time was secretary general of Opus Dei in Rome, as witnessing Escrivá&#x27;s intense displeasure over the election of Pope Paul VI in 1963, and later expressing doubts in private about the salvation of the Pope&#x27;s soul. According to María del Carmen Tapia, who worked with Escrivá in Rome, the founder of Opus Dei had &quot;no respect&quot; for Popes John XXIII or Paul VI and believed that his own organization of Opus Dei was &quot;above the Church in holiness.&quot;

Luigi de Magistris, at the time the regent of the Vatican&#x27;s Apostolic Penitentiary, wrote in a 1989 confidential vote asking for the suspension of the proceedings for Escrivá&#x27;s beatification, that &quot;it is not a mystery that there were serious tensions&quot; between Escrivá and the Jesuits. De Magistris then alluded to Escrivá distancing himself from the Jesuit priest Valentino Sánchez, who had previously been Escrivá&#x27;s confessor, over the Jesuits&#x27; opposition to the proposed constitutions of Opus Dei. Journalist Luis Carandell says that, during his years in Rome, Escrivá kept his distance from the Jesuit Superior General, the Spaniard Pedro Arrupe, to the extent that Arrupe once joked with Antonio Riberi, the apostolic nuncio to Spain, about doubting whether Escrivá really existed.

According to Alberto Moncada, Escrivá&#x27;s years in Rome were dedicated in large part to his campaign to make Opus Dei independent from the authority of diocesan bishops and of the Vatican curia, something which was finally achieved, after Escrivá&#x27;s death, with the establishment in 1982, by Pope John Paul II, of Opus Dei as a personal prelature, subject only to its own prelate and to the Pope. As such, Opus Dei is currently the only personal prelature in the Catholic Church, although this juridical figure ―similar in nature to other kinds of hierarchical organization in the church&#x27;s history, such as military and personal ordinariates― is fruit of the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s aim to provide pastoral attention in ways more suited to the actual situation of many of its faithful. In this way, its work complements that of the dioceses, and in some cases even takes the form of a more direct collaboration: for example, when priests of Opus Dei assume pastoral care of parishes at the request of the local bishops. Escrivá may have had this in mind when he wrote, &quot;The only ambition, the only desire of Opus Dei and each of its members is to serve the Church as the Church wants to be served, within the specific vocation God has given us.&quot; Membership in the prelature does not exempt a Catholic from the authority of the local diocesan bishop.

==Beatification and canonization==
After the death of Escrivá de Balaguer on 26 June 1975, the Postulation for the Cause of his beatification and canonization received many testimonies and postulatory letters from people all over the world. On the fifth anniversary of Escrivá&#x27;s death, the Postulation solicited the initiation of the cause of beatification from the Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints. One-third of the world&#x27;s bishops (an unprecedented number) petitioned for Escrivá&#x27;s beatification.

His cause for beatification was introduced in Rome on 19 February 1981 on the strength of the apparently miraculous cure in 1976 of a rare disease, lipomatosis, suffered by Sister Concepción Boullón Rubio, whose family had prayed to Escrivá to help her. On 9 April 1990, Pope John Paul II declared that Escrivá possessed Christian virtues to a &quot;heroic degree&quot;, and on 6 July 1991 the Board of Physicians for the Congregation of the Causes of Saints unanimously accepted the cure of Sister Rubio. He was beatified on 17 May 1992.

By way of a letter dated 15 March 1993, the Postulation for the Cause received news about the miraculous cure of Dr. Manuel Nevado Rey from cancerous chronic radiodermatitis, an incurable disease, which took place in November 1992. The reported miracle, apparently brought about by Escrivá&#x27;s intervention, was ruled valid by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and approved by Pope John Paul II in December 2001, enabling the canonization of Escrivá. John Paul II, who frequently expressed public endorsement of Opus Dei and its work, canonized Escrivá on 6 October 2002. The canonization Mass was attended by 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around the world, general superiors of many orders and religious congregations, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During the days of the canonization event, church officials commented on the validity of the message of the founder, repeating John Paul II&#x27;s decree &quot;Christifideles Omnes&quot; on Escrivá&#x27;s virtues, which said that &quot;by inviting Christians to be united to God through their daily work, which is something men will have to do and find their dignity in as long as the world lasts, the timeliness of this message is destined to endure as an inexhaustible source of spiritual light, regardless of changing epochs and situations.&quot; 

===Criticism of the process===
Various critics questioned the rapidity of Escrivá&#x27;s canonization. On the eve of Escrivá&#x27;s beatification in 1992, journalist William D. Montalbano, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, described it as &quot;perhaps the most contentious beatification in modern times.&quot; Critics have argued that the process was plagued by irregularities. However, endorsers refer to Rafael Pérez, an Augustinian priest who presided over the tribunal in Madrid for Escrivá&#x27;s cause, as &quot;one of the best experts&quot; on canonization. Pérez stated that the process was fast because Escrivá&#x27;s figure is &quot;of the universal importance,&quot; the Postulators &quot;knew what they were doing&quot;, and, in 1983, the procedures were simplified in order to present &quot;models who lived in a world like ours.&quot; Flavio Capucci, the postulator, also reported that the 6,000 postulatory letters to the Vatican showed &quot;earnestness&quot;.

Escrivá&#x27;s canonization was one of the first to be processed after the 1983 Code of Canon Law streamlined the procedures for canonization, and so it was processed more quickly than was typical before. Mother Teresa was canonized even more quickly, having been beatified just 6 years after her death (Escrivá was beatified in 17 years). According to journalist Kenneth L. Woodward, the 6,000-page long &quot;positio&quot; (the official document about the life and work of the candidate for sainthood prepared by the postulators) was declared confidential, but leaked to the press in 1992, after Escrivá&#x27;s beatification. Woodward declared that, of 2,000 pages of testimonies, about 40% are by either Álvaro del Portillo or Javier Echevarría Rodríguez who, as successors of Escrivá at the head of Opus Dei, would have the most to gain from the Catholic Church recognizing that organization&#x27;s founder as a saint. The only critical testimony quoted in the &quot;positio&quot; was by Alberto Moncada, a Spanish sociologist who had been a member of Opus Dei and whose testimony might have been easier for the church authorities to dismiss because he had had little personal contact with Escrivá and had left the Catholic Church altogether. This critical testimony covered a mere two pages.

Critics of the process also questioned the fact that some of the physicians involved in the authentication of the two &quot;scientifically inexplicable cures&quot; achieved through the posthumous intercession of Escrivá, such as Dr. Raffaello Cortesini (a heart surgeon), were themselves members of Opus Dei. The Vatican has stated that the Medical Consultants for the Congregation affirmed unanimously that the miraculous cure of a cancerous state of chronic radiodermatitis in its third and irreversible stage in Dr. Manuel Nevado Rey (a country doctor in the village of Almendralejo) was &quot;very quick, complete, lasting and scientifically inexplicable.&quot; After six months, the theological consultants, according to the Vatican, also unanimously attributed this cure to Escrivá. On the year of his canonization, the Opus Dei prelate reported that the Postulation has gathered 48 reports of unexplained medical favors attributed to Escriva&#x27;s intercession, as well as 100,000 ordinary favours.

Former Opus Dei members critical of Escrivá&#x27;s character who say that they were refused a hearing during the beatification and canonization processes include Miguel Fisac (a well-known Spanish architect who was one of the earliest members of Opus Dei and remained an associate of Escrivá for nearly twenty years), Vladimir Felzmann (a Czech-born engineer and Catholic priest from the UK, who was Escrivá&#x27;s personal assistant), María del Carmen Tapia (who worked with Escrivá in Opus Dei&#x27;s central offices in Rome and directed its printing press), Carlos Albás (a Spanish lawyer who was also Escrivá&#x27;s first cousin once removed), María Angustias Moreno (who was an official of the women&#x27;s part of Opus Dei, during Escrivá&#x27;s lifetime), and John Roche (an Irish physicist and historian of science who was a member of Opus Dei from 1959 to 1973, and managed one of its schools in Kenya). Several groups critical of Escrivá and of Opus Dei emerged both before and after the canonization of Escrivá, including the Opus Dei Awareness Network (ODAN), and &quot;OpusLibros&quot;, both collaborations of former members who now oppose Opus Dei and its practices.

According to journalist Kenneth L. Woodward, before the official beatification he

Catholic theologian Richard McBrien termed Escrivá&#x27;s sainthood &quot;the most blatant example of a politicized [canonization] in modern times.&quot; According to Catholic writer and biographer John Allen such views are countered by many other ex-members, the present members, and the estimated 900,000 people who attend activities of Opus Dei. He says that the interpretation of the facts &quot;seems to depend upon one&#x27;s basic approach to spirituality, family life, and the implications of a religious vocation.&quot; Allen&#x27;s account of Opus Dei and its founder, however, was not accepted by all reviewers as impartial.

===Reports of discord among judges===
Escrivá&#x27;s canonization attracted an unusual amount of attention and criticism, both within the Catholic Church and by the press. Flavio Capucci, the postulator of Escrivá&#x27;s cause for sainthood, summarized the main accusations against Escrivá: that &quot;he had a bad temper, that he was cruel, that he was vain, that he was close to Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, that he was pro-Nazi and that he was so dismayed by the Second Vatican Council that he even travelled to Greece with the idea that he might convert to the Orthodox religion&quot;.

A &quot;Newsweek&quot; article by Woodward stated that, of the nine judges of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints presiding over Escrivá&#x27;s cause for beatification, two had requested a suspension of the proceedings. The dissenters were identified as Luigi De Magistris, a prelate working in the Vatican&#x27;s tribunal of the Apostolic Penitentiary, and Justo Fernández Alonso, rector of the Spanish National Church in Rome. According to Woodward, one of the dissenters wrote that the beatification of Escrivá could cause the church &quot;grave public scandal.&quot; The same article quoted Cardinal Silvio Oddi as declaring that many bishops were &quot;very displeased&quot; with the rush to canonize Escrivá so soon after his death. In interviews, José Saraiva Martins, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, has denied being aware of that dissent.

The journal &quot;Il Regno&quot;, published in Bologna by the congregation of the Priests of the Sacred Heart (the Dehonians), reproduced, in May 1992, the confidential vote of one of the judges in Escrivá&#x27;s cause of beatification, in which the judge asked that the process be suspended. The document questioned the haste of the proceedings, the near absence of testimony from critics in the documentation gathered by the postulators, the failure of the documentation to properly address issues about Escrivá&#x27;s relations with the Franco regime and with other Catholic organizations, and suggestions from the official testimonies themselves that Escrivá lacked proper spiritual humility. This document does not identify the judge by name, but its author indicates that he met Escrivá only once, briefly, in 1966, while serving as a notary for the Holy Office, which implies that the judge in question was De Magistris.

As regent of the Apostolic Penitentiary, at the time of the vote De Magistris&#x27;s work was largely concerned with issues arising from confession and penance. According to church law, a confessor has an absolute duty not to disclose anything that he might have learned from a penitent in the course of a confession (see Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church). In his vote, which its own contents date to August 1989, De Magistris argued that the testimony from the main witness, Álvaro del Portillo, should have been entirely excluded from the proceedings, since Portillo had been Escrivá&#x27;s confessor for 31 years.

John Allen Jr. comments that, according to some observers within the Catholic Church, De Magistris was punished for his opposition to Escrivá&#x27;s canonization. De Magistris was promoted in 2001 to the head of the Apostolic Penitentiary, an important position in the Vatican bureaucracy usually occupied by a cardinal. However, Pope John Paul II did not make De Magistris a cardinal and replaced him as head of the Apostolic Penitentiary after less than two years, effectively forcing him into retirement. The decision by Pope Francis to make De Magistris a cardinal at the consistory of 14 February 2015, when De Magistris was about to turn 89 and therefore could no longer participate in papal conclaves, was interpreted by some commentators as consolation for how De Magistris had been treated under John Paul II.

==Teachings and legacy==

The significance of Escrivá&#x27;s message and teachings has been a topic of debate, by Catholics and others. The Protestant French historian Pierre Chaunu, a professor at the Sorbonne and president of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, said that &quot;the work of Escrivá de Balaguer will undoubtedly mark the 21st century. This is a prudent and reasonable wager. Do not pass close to this contemporary without paying him close attention&quot;. The Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, who was appointed cardinal by Pope John Paul II (but died in 1988 before his investiture), dismissed Escrivá&#x27;s principal work, &quot;The Way&quot;, as &quot;a little Spanish manual for advanced Boy Scouts&quot; and argued that it was quite insufficient to sustain a major religious organization. However, the monk and spiritual writer Thomas Merton declared that Escrivá&#x27;s book &quot;will certainly do a great deal of good by its simplicity, which is the true medium for the Gospel message&quot;.

Critics of Opus Dei have often argued that the importance and originality of Escrivá&#x27;s intellectual contributions to theology, history, and law, at least as measured by his published writings, has been grossly exaggerated by his devotees. However, various officials of the Catholic Church have spoken well of Escrivá&#x27;s influence and of the relevance of his teachings. In the decree introducing the cause of beatification and canonization of Escrivá, Cardinal Ugo Poletti wrote in 1981: &quot;For having proclaimed the universal call to holiness since he founded Opus Dei during 1928, Msgr. Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, has been unanimously recognized as the precursor of precisely what constitutes the fundamental nucleus of the Church&#x27;s magisterium, a message of such fruitfulness in the life of the Church.&quot; Sebastiano Baggio, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, wrote a month after Escrivá&#x27;s death: &quot;It is evident even today that the life, works, and message of the founder of Opus Dei constitutes a turning point, or more exactly a new original chapter in the history of Christian spirituality.&quot; A Vatican &quot;peritus&quot; or consultor for the process of beatification said that &quot;he is like a figure from the deepest spiritual sources&quot;. Franz König, Archbishop of Vienna, wrote in 1975:

&quot;The magnetic force of Opus Dei probably comes from its profoundly lay spirituality. At the very beginning, in 1928, Msgr. Escrivá anticipated the return to the Patrimony of the Church brought by the Second Vatican Council ... [H]e was able to anticipate the great themes of the Church&#x27;s pastoral action in the dawn of the third millennium of her history.&quot;

The &quot;absolutely central&quot; part of Escrivá&#x27;s teaching, says American theologian William May, is that &quot;sanctification is possible only because of the grace of God, freely given to his children through his only-begotten Son, and it consists essentially in an intimate, loving union with Jesus, our Redeemer and Savior.&quot;

Escrivá&#x27;s books, including &quot;Furrow&quot;, &quot;The Way&quot;, &quot;Christ is Passing By&quot;, and &quot;The Forge&quot;, continue to be read widely, and emphasize the laity&#x27;s calling to daily sanctification (a message also to be found in the documents of Vatican II). Pope John Paul II made the following observation in his homily at the beatification of Escrivá:

John Paul II&#x27;s decree &quot;Christifideles omnes&quot; states: &quot;By inviting Christians to seek union with God through their daily work — which confers dignity on human beings and is their lot as long as they exist on earth — his message is destined to endure as an inexhaustible source of spiritual light regardless of changing epochs and situations&quot;.

<text>Wymondham Abbey (pronounced &quot;Windum&quot;) is the Anglican parish church for the town of Wymondham in Norfolk, England.

==History==
The monastery was founded in 1107 by William d&#x27;Aubigny, Butler (Pincerna) to King Henry I. William was a prominent Norfolk landowner, with estates in Wymondham and nearby New Buckenham. The d&#x27;Aubigny (sometimes Latinised to d&#x27;Albini) family originated from St. Martin d&#x27;Aubigny in Normandy.

William d&#x27;Aubigny&#x27;s monastery was a dependency of the Benedictine monastery at St Albans, where his uncle Richard was Abbot. The foundation charter stipulated that the prior, as a token of dependence, was to pay a mark of silver yearly to the abbot on the festival of St. Alban. If the priory should become an abbey, then all tokens of subjection to St. Albans would cease. Wymondham Priory was relatively small, initially for some twelve Benedictine monks, but grew in influence and wealth over the coming centuries. William d&#x27;Aubigny, the founder, and Maud his wife, who was the daughter of Roger Bigod, and sister of Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, richly endowed the priory with lands, churches, tithes, and rents.

The founder intended his church to serve as a parish church for the local community as well as a monastic church for the monks, an ill-defined arrangement that led to frequent disputes. The monastic east end was completed by about 1130, and the western half (for the parish) about thirty years later. It was originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St Alban. Later, following the murder of Thomas Becket in 1170, Becket&#x27;s name was added to the dedication and Alban&#x27;s dropped. Archaeological excavation in 2002 and 2017 disclosed indications of a Late Saxon or early Norman church beneath the nave of the current church. In 1249, Pope Innocent IV ruled that the monks should have the chancel, central tower, transepts, south aisle and SW tower, while the nave N aisle and NW tower became the parish church served by an independent vicar instituted by the bishop.

In 1174, the founder&#x27;s grandson, William d&#x27;Aubigny III, established a chapel in the town dedicated to Becket with two monks from the priory as chaplains. Having served as a gild chapel, then a grammar school and later the town library, in 2022 Becket&#x27;s Chapel l was purchased by Historic Norfolk and, following a major restoration, is now run as an arts centre.

In the time of Stephen, King of England, the prior obtained the grant of a three days&#x27; fair at Wymondham on the eve, day and morrow of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, and also a confirmation of the weekly market. In 1349, both the prior and sub-prior died of the pestilence. Seven of the monks of St. Albans and its cells joined the crusade in Flanders in 1383, under Henry le Despenser, bishop of Norwich. Among them was William York of Wymondham Priory. Of those who returned, none regained their former health, having suffered much from the heat and from foul water. The noted historian and chronicler Thomas Walsingham was appointed prior in 1394.

Disputes between the Wymondham and St. Albans monks were quite common, and in 1449, following a successful petition to the king, Pope Nicholas V granted Wymondham the right to become an Abbey in its own right. However, an episcopal visitation in October, 1492 found numerous irregularities. The buildings of the dorter and farm not repaired; brothers mixed with seculars in the south aisle of the church; they were not in cloister at customary hours; they &#x27;did not exercise themselves in the study of letters&#x27; but were &#x27;too fond of ease&#x27;. Bishop Goldwell replaced the abbot and the final forty years of the monastery were apparently peaceful and well-ordered.

King Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries brought about the closure of Wymondham Abbey, which was surrendered to the Royal Commissioner John Flowerdew in 1538. The monks had, apparently willingly, already signed the Oath of Supremacy, and were given generous pensions. The last abbot, Loye Ferrers, was appointed vicar when this post fell vacant.

==Architecture==

The church was originally cruciform in shape, with a central tower and twin west towers. When it was built, Caen stone in Normandy was shipped specially across the English Channel to face the walls. The central tower became unstable and was replaced in about 1376 by a tall octagonal tower (now part ruined), which held the monks&#x27; bells. In 1447, work on a much taller single west tower began. This replaced the original Norman towers and held the townspeople&#x27;s bells. The parish part of the church (see above) was almost doubled in size in the 14th/15th centuries by enlarging of the north aisle to be wider than the nave. In c.1450 the nave height was raised with new Perpendicular style clerestory windows and an exotic hammer-beam roof incorporating human-sized angels with outstretched wings. 
The years following the Dissolution saw the gradual demolition of the monastic buildings for re-use of the stone. The eastern end of the church (blocked off from the nave by a solid wall since about 1385) was destroyed, leaving the present church (at 70 m.) only about half its original length. Having failed to secure the east end of the monastic church from the Crown, the parishioners bought the south aisle. This they re-built and greatly enlarged after 1544, incorporating windows re-used from the former chapter house. Repairs to the parish chancel were carried out following Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s visit to Norfolk in 1573 (date and initials may be seen on exterior stonework) and most of the Norman pillars were squared off 1584/5.

A notable later benefactor was the Rev&#x27;d William Papillon, vicar from 1788 to 1836. Papillon was a wealthy man who purchased the adjacent Abbey Meadow (which gives the church its incomparable rustic setting), separating meadow from churchyard with a ha-ha. He also bought the ruinous east tower, enlarged the churchyard and set up a school for poor children. By the late 1800s the church was again in poor repair with a huge crack in the west tower. A major restoration and re-ordering of the church was carried out 1900-1903 when a new stone gallery was built under the west tower to support the organ in place of a wooden Georgian gallery.

Notable features of the church are the twin towers (a landmark for miles around), the Norman nave, the hammer-beam angel roof of c.1445 in the nave and fine hammer-beam north-aisle roof. The west tower houses a peal of 10 bells, re-cast and re-hung in 1967. Hung in the bell tower are six well-preserved 18th-century hatchments.

===Interior===

The church is also remarkable for its high quality fittings such as the 1793 organ by James Davis and 1810 chamber organ (also by James Davis). The splendid gilded reredos or altar screen with tester and rood figures above is one of the largest works of Sir Ninian Comper. This was dedicated in 1921 as a war memorial, though the gilding was not finished until 1934. Other works by Comper are the serene statue of the Virgin and Child and nearby paschal candlestick.

Also of note is the Renaissance c.1520 terracotta sedilia, once thought to be a memorial to Abbot Loye Ferrers. This is Italian work from the same workshop as tombs at Oxborough, Norfolk and Layer Marney, Essex. Note also the 1712 Georgian candelabrum (now in the Lady Chapel) and Royal Arms of George II (south aisle), the carved octagonal 15th Century font with modern gilded font cover by Cecil Upcher, the Arts and Crafts Triptych by E P Warren and Robert Anning Bell in the Lady Chapel and many smaller features such as angels, musicians and figures carved on the roof timbers and corbels.

A modern icon panel by the late Rev. David Hunter is on display in the church, which tells the story of St Thomas Becket’s life. The Stations of the Cross icons in the nave and chancel are by iconographer Helen McIldowie-Jenkins.

==Present day==
The Church of St Mary and St Thomas of Canterbury serves as the parish church of Wymondham. The Parish also incorporates the Victorian church of Holy Trinity in Spooner Row village nearby. A wide range of services for worship take place at the Abbey, including Sunday Sung Eucharist, Daily Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer. In 2016, with financial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and local donors, new extensions were built at the east end. These provide display areas, comfortable social and refreshment facilities and vestries.

It is an active parish with a Friends group and a large group of welcomers and volunteers. There is much interest in the history of the building and parish, with a Preservation Trust and Hon. Archivist. The Parish Archives, some dating back to the 13th century, are housed in the parvise chamber above the porch. Early items include deeds, wills, inventories, a royal market charter of 1460, wardens&#x27; accounts, the parish Bede Roll of 1524 and records of the town&#x27;s medieval religious gilds. The church also has a 1613 edition of the King James Bible. Selections of documents, artefacts and silver are displayed at the back of the church.

==Organs==
Early records suggest that the parish had an organ in the late 1400s, and the church still has a guarantee for a new &#x27;payre of orgons in ye quire&#x27; built by William Beton (or Bylton) of King&#x27;s Lynn in 1523. Beton (d. 1553) later became royal court organ maker/tuner, building organs at Hampton Court, the Chapels Royal and Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral . Today&#x27;s handsome main organ was built in London by James Davis and installed here in 1793. It is housed in a fine Chippendale &#x27;Gothick&#x27; style case on the gallery at the west end of the nave. The three-manual organ (with later addition of pedals) has been enlarged and rebuilt several times but retains most of its original 18th-century pipework. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. A smaller chamber organ, also by James Davis and built in 1810, is located in the north aisle. &#x27;The Organ&#x27; by David Baker (a former organist at the Abbey) is published by Shire Publications and contains a full description of the instrument, with many illustrations of its components. Wymondham Abbey has a tradition of excellence in choral music and welcomes singers of all ages.

A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

<doc id="100402" wikidata="Q1787230" url="?curid=100402" title="Wymondham">
<text>Wymondham ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the South Norfolk district of Norfolk, England. It lies on the River Tiffey, south-west of Norwich and just off the A11 road to London. The parish, one of Norfolk&#x27;s largest, includes rural areas to the north and south, with hamlets of Suton, Silfield, Spooner Row and Wattlefield. It had a population of 14,405 in 2011, of whom 13,587 lived in the town itself.

==Development==

The community developed during the Anglo-Saxon period and expanded with the establishment of a priory in 1107 and a market in 1204. Industrially, Wymondham became known as a centre of woodturning and brush-making, retaining its brush factories until the late 20th century. New housing to the north and east of the town centre brought rapid expansion. Dual carriageways for the A11 and the development of rapid rail links to Norwich and Cambridge means Wymondham is now a commuter town. Major local employers include the headquarters of Norfolk Constabulary and the Lotus Cars factory at nearby Hethel.

The ancient centre, much damaged in a fire of 1615, contains landmarks and listed buildings that include the twin-towered Wymondham Abbey. Modern Wymondham continues to grow. The current local-authority action plan envisages building 2,200 new homes by 2026, while promoting it as &quot;a forward-looking market town which embraces sustainable growth to enhance its unique identity and sense of community.&quot;

The uncertain, Anglo-Saxon origins of the name probably consist of a personal name such as &quot;Wigmund&quot; or &quot;Wimund&quot;, with &quot;hām&quot; meaning village or settlement, or &quot;hamm&quot; meaning a river meadow. The place has been referred to as Windham on occasions.

===Early history===
The site where Wymondham stands shows evidence of occupation from the earliest period of human settlement in Norfolk. Pot boilers and burnt flint have been found in nearby fields, as have flint axe-heads, scrapers and many other objects. Evidence of the Bronze Age appears in a number of ring ditches, enclosures and linear crop marks. Objects found include an arrowhead, fragments of rapiers, assorted metal tools and pottery sherds.

Iron Age artefacts were investigated systematically while the A11 bypass was being built in the early 1990s. There are postholes, quarries and evidence of iron smelting and bone working. Objects from the period include coins, jewellery and pottery.

Roman remains include an aisled structure and a copper-alloy metal-working site. A Roman road from Venta Icenorum to Watton and beyond is visible as cropmarks. Large numbers of coins and pottery sherds have been found, as have personal items such as brooches, cosmetic tools and a duck figurine.

Few Saxon buildings survive, although excavations showed a sunken-featured building with Early and Middle Saxon pottery. Remains of a possible Late Saxon church were discovered during excavations at Wymondham Abbey in 2002.

===Middle Ages===
By 1086, Wymondham had 376 households (giving an estimated total population of 1,880), which put it among the top 20 per cent of settlements recorded in Domesday. The land was held by two feudal Lords: William the Conqueror and William de Warenne.

The Saxon church made way for a new Norman priory in 1107, its church shared between the monks and the townspeople. This evolved over the centuries into the Wymondham Abbey seen today.

Earthworks at Moot Hill are probably a medieval ring-work dating between 1088 and 1139. It is on the Historic England&#x27;s Heritage at Risk register.

The first market charter came from King John in 1204, although an earlier market was probably held. The charter was renewed by Henry VI in 1440 and a weekly market is still held on Fridays.

===Early modern period===

Wymondham Abbey was dissolved in 1538 and the domestic buildings and monastic half of the church were gradually demolished. Loye Ferrers, the last Abbot, became Vicar when the post fell vacant, and the remaining church buildings continued in use as the parish church.

Robert Kett led a rebellion in 1549 of peasants and small farmers against enclosure of common land. His force of scarcely armed men held the city of Norwich for six weeks until defeated by the King&#x27;s forces. He was hanged at Norwich Castle and his brother William was hanged from the church west tower. Kett&#x27;s Oak, ostensibly the rallying point of the rebellion, can be seen on the B1172 road between Wymondham and Hethersett, part of an earlier main road to London.

The town suffered a major fire beginning on Sunday, 11 June 1615. Losses included the Market Cross, the vicarage, the old town hall and the schoolhouse. Buildings that survived include the &quot;Green Dragon&quot; inn. Thereafter, 327 inhabitants – some 55 per cent of residents at the time – made claims for lost goods and houses. The register of St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Norwich records that John Flodder and others were executed for arson on 2 December 1615. Rebuilding varied in pace. A new Market Cross was completed in 1617, but in 1621 there were still some 15 properties to be rebuilt.

In 1695, the Attleborough road was the second British turnpike built, pre-dated only by the Great North Road.

===Later Wymondham===
In 1785, a prison was built in line with the ideas of the prison reformer John Howard. The first in England to have separate cells for prisoners, it was widely copied there and in the United States. It now serves as Wymondham Heritage Museum.

The collapse of the woollen industry in the mid-19th century led to poverty. In 1836 there were still 600 hand looms, but by 1845 only 60. The town became a backwater in Victorian times, untouched by development elsewhere.

The Norwich &amp; Brandon Railway opened in 1845 and a branch north to Dereham and Wells-next-the-Sea in 1847. Another branch opened in 1881 ran south to the Great Eastern Main Line at Forncett.

The Murders at Stanfield Hall occurred on 28 November 1848.

In 1943, a military hospital at Morley was handed to the United States Army Air Forces. Over 3,000 patients were treated there after D-Day. It was later converted for use by Wymondham College.

For much of the 20th century, there were two brush factories together employing up to 1,000 people. They both closed in the 1980s and the land was turned over to housing.

==Governance==
Wymondham has a town council responsible for local matters laid down by law, including a role in urban planning. It has 14 members elected every four years. Wymondham divides into four wards: North, East, Central and South. Spooner Row, though within the parish of Wymondham, elects its own community council.

Wymondham civil parish falls in the district of South Norfolk, returning six district councillors. In elections in May 2023, Wymondham elected three Liberal Democrat District councillors, two Conservatives and one Labour. In Town Council elections fourteen councillors are returned. After May 2023 local elections, the Town Council consisted of seven Liberal Democrats, four Labour, two Green and a solitary Conservative councillor. In 2023 the Town Council elected two women for the roles of mayor and deputy mayor, the first time this had occurred in Wymondham&#x27;s history.

After a by-election for Central Wymondham held the same day as the General Election on 4 July 2024, another Liberal Democrat was elected bringing the total to eight on the Council.

In County Council elections, the north part, with the Town Centre, returns one councillor to Norfolk County Council as Wymondham electoral division. The southern part elects a county councillor as part of Forehoe electoral division.

For much of the 20th century, Wymondham belonged to the South Norfolk parliamentary constituency. After a boundary review, Wymondham was moved to the Mid Norfolk constituency. However, Wymondham will revert to South Norfolk again after another boundary review, a long drawn out process which was only formalised in late 2023.

==Geography==
At (52.57°, 1.116°), and north-north-west of London, Wymondham stands above sea level, south-west of Norwich, at the confluence of two small rivers. The largely rural parishes around it include Hethersett, Hethel, Ashwellthorpe, Bunwell, Wicklewood, Crownthorpe and Wramplingham. The market town of Attleborough lies to the south-west. Wymondham has a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. Wymondham was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

Wymondham&#x27;s topography is marked by its river meadow and flat, low-lying agricultural landscape, much like the rest of East Anglia. The parish has an area of . The geology is based on chalk, with a layer of boulder clay laid down in the last ice age. The River Tiffey, flowing north, forms a boundary between the built-up town centre and the rural southern part of the parish.

The built environment of Wymondham&#x27;s town centre is marked by early-modern town houses and a number of buildings that survived the 1615 fire, including Wymondham Abbey. Much of the centre forms a conservation area with numerous listed buildings. Beyond the centre lie 20th and 21st-century housing estates of mainly detached and semi-detached properties. There are trading and industrial estates along the route of the A11, which passes north-east through the south of the parish. The heavy rail Breckland line crosses the parish in the same direction. The rest of the parish is largely arable farmland.

The parish has one of the largest areas in Norfolk. It includes swaths to the north and south of the town, including the hamlets of Suton, Silfield, Spooner Row and Wattlefield.

===Climate===

==Demography==

The United Kingdom Census 2001 gave Wymondham a total resident population of 12,539 and a population density of . By 2011, the population had risen to 14,405, with a density of . Wymondham has an average age of 41.8.

In 2011, 94.5 per cent of the population were White British, 1.1 per cent Asian, 0.5 per cent White Irish and 0.3 per cent Black.

Christianity accounts for 60.3 per cent of the population, while 29.9 declare no religious affiliation. There are small populations of Muslims (0.5%), Buddhists (0.3%) and Hindus (0.2%).

The 2011 census showed 72.6 per cent of the adult population economically active, 2.9 per cent unemployed and 16.8 per cent retired. The population is well-educated: 27 per cent have post-18 qualifications.

The following table outlines the population change in the town since 1801, with slow growth, then decline in the 19th century, followed by recovery and rapid growth by the end of the 20th century.

==Economy==

Wymondham is a commuter town mainly for Norwich, Cambridge and London. The 2011 census reported as the commonest employment sectors the wholesale and retail trade (15.4%), health and social work (13.6%) and education (11.3%).

A major employer is Norfolk Constabulary. There is a retail area centred on the market square, with national-chain branches and independent shops and businesses. Traditionally, Wymondham was a centre of woodturning and brush-making; a spigot and spoon feature on the town sign to mark this. Major brush factories appeared, with railway sidings, saw mills and engineering workshops. These closed in late 20th century and were developed as housing.

==Landmarks==
===War memorial===
Wymondham war memorial is a stone obelisk above an octagonal three-stepped base, at the junction of Vicar Street, Town Green and Middleton Street. Unveiled on 24 July 1921, and updated after World War II, it recalls 189 military and civilian deaths in the two World Wars. It is a Grade II listed feature.

===Wymondham Abbey===
Wymondham Abbey, founded in 1107, is a Grade I listed building. Originally a Benedictine priory, it became an independent abbey in 1449. During this period the two-tower design evolved. The east tower was built first to an octagonal design (1409) and the west tower completed in 1498.

The abbey was dissolved in 1538, after which many of its buildings were demolished. Their remains, including the surviving arch of the chapter house, are scattered around the church. The open land to the south of the church, above further remains of the medieval abbey, is a scheduled monument. The east end of the church was demolished at the dissolution. The surviving -long building is about half the original length.

The remainder survived the dissolution and continued in use as the local Church of England parish church. Some elements of the original Norman architecture are visible externally, while internally a 15th-century hammerbeam roof and a reredos by Ninian Comper can be seen.

===Cavick House===
Cavick House, a Grade I listed building, dates from the early 18th century. It is a red-brick building with painted quoins and some original interior decoration. It had fallen into disrepair by 1999, but has since been restored. The nearby Cavick House Farmhouse, built in the early 18th century, is a Grade II listed building.

===Beckett&#x27;s Chapel===
Beckett&#x27;s Chapel is thought to have been founded in the late 12th century by the son of William d&#x27;Aubigny and founder of Wymondham Abbey. The current chapel dates largely to about 1400, when it was rebuilt. In the post-Reformation period it was turned into a school and also used for a time as a lock-up for remand prisoners. Restoration in 1873 was followed by use as a public hall, a school and Wymondham&#x27;s library. In 1999, a plaque was attached to mark the 450th anniversary of Kett&#x27;s Rebellion. In 2008, it became Wymondham Arts Centre. Original elements of the chapel, including an arch-braced hammerbeam roof, are still visible inside. It is a Grade I listed building. In 2018, it was placed on Historic England&#x27;s Heritage at Risk register, as it suffers from damp and is slowly decaying.

===The Market Cross===
The Market Cross was built in 1617–1618 after the original was destroyed in the fire of 1615. It is a timber-framed octagonal building with an upper floor raised above an open undercroft. It served as the centre of administration of the town&#x27;s weekly market. In the late 19th century it was converted into a subscription reading room. After restoration in 1989, it reopened as the town&#x27;s Tourist Information Centre. It is a Grade I listed building.

===Grade II* listed buildings===
The six Grade II* listed buildings in Wymondham are The &quot;Green Dragon&quot; pub, Kimberley Hall, Priory House, Stanfield Hall, The Chestnuts and 3 Market Street.

Wymondham railway station, built in 1844, retains much of its atmosphere, including a timber signal box for semaphore signalling from 1877, in use until 2012. Almost derelict by 1988, the site was transformed by the local businessman and railway enthusiast David Turner, who restored the buildings and ran a Brief Encounter-themed restaurant on Platform 1 before retiring in 2011. The station was voted Best Small Station in the 2006 National Rail Awards. Both station and signal box are Grade II listed buildings.

Toll&#x27;s Meadow is a nature reserve and wildlife site with footpaths along the River Tiffey. Wildlife there includes kingfishers, herons, roe deer and water voles. The Lizard is a conservation area and wildlife site managed locally as a &quot;piece of informal, natural countryside for the general benefit and enjoyment of the people of Wymondham&quot;. The Tiffey Trails offer accessible walks, interpretation boards, wood-carvings, benches and waymarkers. In Spring 2022, a new Ketts County trail was added, forming a 16-mile walk starting at Becketswell near the Abbey. This is part of the wider 500 mile plus Norfolk Trails network.

==Transport==
The Breckland line runs through the parish, with stations at Wymondham and Spooner Row.

<text>The Kingdom of Saloum (Serer: &quot;Saluum&quot; or &quot;Saalum&quot;) was a Serer kingdom in present-day Senegal and parts of Gambia. The precolonial capital was the city of Kahone. Its history, geography and culture was intricately linked with the sister state, the Kingdom of Sine, and it was common to refer to them as the Sine-Saloum or the Serer Kingdoms.

==Typonymy==
Serer oral traditions recount that the area was named Saluum/Saloum by the Maad Saloum Mbegane Ndour in the later part of the 15th century (c. 1494), named after Saalum Suwareh, the marabout of Mbegan Ndour. Alternatively, the name &#x27;Saluum&#x27; could mean &#x27;land of the Luum&#x27;, an important family in the region.

Portuguese explorers in the 15th century referred to Saloum as the kingdom of &quot;Borçalo&quot;, a corruption of the Wolof &#x27;Bor-ba-Saloum&#x27; for &quot;King of Saloum&quot; (Maad Saloum).

==History==

===Early History===
Saloum and the surrounding region is known for its many ancient burial mounds or &quot;tumuli&quot; containing the graves of kings and others. The kingdom also has numerous mysterious stone circles whose function and history are still debated by scholars, most of which pre-date the formation of the kingdom. The first inhabitants of the region, according to oral tradition, were a Mande people who immigrated from the Wagadu Empire to flee a drought, likely towards the end of the first millennium CE. The Serer came to Saloum starting in the 11th century, fleeing forced conversion to Islam and the growing centralization of power in Takrur and later the Jolof Empire in the Senegal river valley, and became the dominant ethnic group in the core of the future Saloum.

Before Mbegan Ndour, Saloum existed in some form (as attested in European written sources), but it is unclear what form it took. The area was composed a series of chiefdoms and independent villages, many of which led by Serer Lamanes and/or part of the Jolof Empire&#x27;s sphere of influence. The core of what would become the Kingdom of Saloum was a Lamanic state called Mbey, with the capital at Njop.

===Founding===
In the late 15th century, Ali Elibana, a Toucouleur marabout, established himself at Njop and took control of the surrounding salt-producing region, Mbey, mostly populated by the Serer. This was a period of profound destabilization and succession disputes in the Jolof Empire, which had extended its hegemony south to the Gambia river under Biram Njeme Eler (c.1465–c.1481). While the southern and eastern parts of the region that became Saloum were under the influence of Jolof, Saloum the kingdom was never a part of the empire.

Mbegane Ndour, whose paternal roots were in the region, came to Mbey from Sine likely with the intention of carving out a kingdom for himself. Around the turn of the 16th century, he launched a religious conflict against the Muslim Elibana, strenghthened by the purchase of horses and guns from European merchants on the coast. In the legend, after proving unable to overcome him on the battlefield, Ndour transformed into a snake and hid outside Elibana&#x27;s mosque; when the marabout emerged from his prayers, the snake bit him, and he died. He then fought and defeated Diattara Tambedou, who was either Elibana&#x27;s successor or a former ally of Ndour&#x27;s. Tambedou, a Muslim Soninke, was likely a salt merchant. Control over this vital resource underpinned the conflict as much or more than religious differences.

Ndour renamed Njop Kahone, meaning &#x27;this is the one&#x27; in Serer, and made it the capital of a kingdom modeled on his homeland, Sine. He built up his power by allying with the various smaller powers of the region, including Serer Lamanes, Soninke or Toucouleur marabouts, and local village chiefs, but he only directly controlled Mbey. At some point, he may have served as regent to the underage Maad a Sinig (King of the Kingdom of Sine).

===Height===
After Mbegane Ndour&#x27;s death he was succeeded by Giran O Ngap, a Guelwar, but his reign was consumed by civil conflict first with local marabouts and finally with Ndour&#x27;s nephew Latmenge Dielene, who poisoned him and took power. Rather than relying on a balance of alliances like his uncle had done, Latmenge Dielene built a military powerful state with clearly defined provinces run by families loyal to the Maad Saloum. He fought numerous wars to build up the power of the ruling aristocracy and impose central power and tribute on previously independent villages or statelets, including the kingdom of Niumi.

By 1566, the process of unification and centralization was completed under Maad Saloum Lat Ciloor Bajaan, who extended Saloum&#x27;s power to the north bank of the Gambia and made the Kingdom of Niani pay tribute. Two districts of The Gambia retain the name Saloum today. A major part of this expansion process was the welcoming of immigrant families fleeing conflict elsewhere in the region, granting them fiefs either to extend control over uninhabited areas or ensure the loyalty of conquered regions. At its height, four major trading ports on the Gambia river fell within Saloum&#x27;s zone of influence: Barra in Niumi, Iambor in Badibu, Kaur in Saloum itself, and Cassan in Niani.

The most important offices of the state were monopolized by members of the Guelwar clan. But the multiplication of titles and the importance of trade on the Gambia gradually undermined central control.

===Clashes with Colonialism and Islam===
As one of the wealthiest and most stable states in the region, the Maad Saloum was able to play France and England off of each other for centuries to ensure the best terms of trade. In 1785 Saalum Sandene signed a trade treaty with the French, but the upheavals of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era ensured continued English dominance of the important Saloum-Saloum market. The end of the Atlantic slave trade saw the kingdom&#x27;s foreign trade limited mostly to foodstuffs, which further increased the power of landowners relative to the monarchy, and pushed the &quot;ceddo&quot; warrior class to increasingly prey on their subjects.

In 1857 the French trading post at Albreda on the Gambia was given to the English in exchange for Portendick, and Saloum was left unable to balance the two colonial powers against each other. Two years later, Governor Louis Faidherbe led an expedition up the Saloum river and imposed a new treaty on the Maad Saloum. 

In 1861, Maba Diakhou Bâ, a Muslim cleric, took control of Badibbu, also known as Rip, on Saloum&#x27;s southern edge. Shortly afterwards, Sambou Oumanneh Touray, Maba disciple defeated and killed the Fara Sabakh and Fara Sandial, joined the two countries together (hence : &quot;Sabakh-Sandial&quot;) and ruled it. Maba soon controlled most of Saloum and part of Niumi. His forces clashed with the French and, despite a defeat, continued to attract new recruits, with the army numbering up to 11,000 fighting men. In 1864 the French recognized him as Almamy of Baddibu and Saloum, but his growing power threatened to unify Senegambia against them. An alarmed French governor Émile Pinet-Laprade marched on Saloum at the head of 1,600 regulars, 2,000 cavalry, and 4,000 volunteers and footsoldiers. At the Battle of Pathé Badiane outside of Nioro, however, the marabout forces led by Lat Dior drove the French back towards Kaolack.

As well as forcibly converting traditional states and their populations to Islam, Maba Diakhou Bâ sought to abolish the traditional caste system of the Serer states. In 1867, he invaded the Kingdom of Sine, but was defeated and killed at the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune.

After Maba&#x27;s defeat, Saloum was incorporated into the colony of Senegal. The kings continued to hold their court in Kahone, but the city was eclipsed commercially by neighboring Kaolack. However, like the Kingdom of Sine, the royal dynasty survived up to 1969, when the last King of Saloum Fode N&#x27;Gouye Joof, and the last King of Sine Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof died. After their deaths, both were incorporated into newly independent Senegal.

===Restoration of the Monarchy===
In 2017, the Serer of Saloum decided to reinstate their monarchy, and Thierno Coumba Daga Ndao was selected from the Guelowar matrilineage to succeed the throne. After a contentious election, he was crowned King on 21 May 2017 at Kahone. He is the current King of Saloum as of 2024, and the maternal uncle of the current King of Sine, Niokhobaye Fatou Diène Diouf, from the Royal House of Semou Njekeh Joof.

==People and Society==
The core of the Kingdom of Saloum is populated mostly by the Serer, but gradually the Wolof immigrants have settled in along with the Fulas, Mandinkas, etc. Unlike the Kingdom of Sine which is more deeply rooted in &quot;Serer-conservatism&quot;, such as the preservation of Serer religion, culture, traditions, etc., Saloum is more cosmopolitan and multi-religious. This explains why some Serer traditionalists who adhere to the tenets of Serer religion are reluctant to afford it the same religious status afforded to Sine as one of the sacred Serer holy sites, in spite of housing many of the Serer sites (see Serer ancient history). 

The Serer language and Wolof are both widely spoken in Saloum. The Cangin languages are also spoken.

== Economy ==
Saloum includes flat, swampy tideland areas inland from the Saloum River delta, which allowed for a flourishing industry of salt-manufacture. The kingdom exported this highly valuable resource regionally, with Kahone as a major trade center. The &quot;coubal&quot; was a tax in kind on salt levied by the Maad Saloum. He exercised a monopoly on salt sales, and production was restricted to women to prevent rival princes from using the saltpans as a revenue source with which they could challenge the king. Control of Gambia river ports allowed the export of salt east towards the Mali Empire. The Saloum river delta was also a major center for the harvesting, preserving, and export of fish, oysters, and shellfish. Niominka traders went up and down the coast, and later Europeans and Lançados traded in the many creeks and inlets. 

The economic base in the 19th and 20th centuries shifted to groundnut cultivation and trade, exporting large quantities of nuts to Europe.

==Government==
The main provinces of Saloum were: Mbey, where the Maad Saloum ruled directly; Joñik centered around Djilor; Siñi north of Kahone, ruled by the &quot;Bar Ngay&quot; descended from the Ndiaye dynasty of Jolof; Ndukumaan east of Siñi ruled by the Ndao family, formerly the rulers of Namandirou; Kajmoor and Mandaax along the Gambia river, also ruled by Ndiayes; among other, smaller territories, sometimes ruled by marabouts. The ruling class were ethnically and culturally Serer, part of the Guelowar clan, and were known as &quot;ceddo&quot; who often exploited and raided the population. Vassals included, at various times, Badibu, Niani, Niumi, Sabakh, and Sandial. The powers and prerogatives of local subordinate rulers varied.

The great &quot;Jaraaf&quot; was the head of the council that elected the Maad Saloum, also known as the &quot;Buur&quot; in Wolof, and would rule the nation in the event of his death until his successor had been enthroned. &quot;Buur&quot;-administrators served as governors of villages and provinces on behalf of the king, assisted by &quot;Farba&quot; who were in charge of enforcing laws and dispensing justice.
