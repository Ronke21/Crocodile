<text>Gatineau ( ; ) is a city in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is located on the northern bank of the Ottawa River, immediately across from Ottawa, Ontario. Gatineau is the largest city in the Outaouais administrative region of Quebec and is also part of Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region. As of 2021, Gatineau is the fourth-largest city in Quebec with a population of 291,041, and it is part of the Ottawa-Gatineau census metropolitan area with a population of 1,488,307 making it the fourth largest in Canada.

Gatineau is coextensive with a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) of the same name, whose geographical code is 81. It is the seat of the judicial district of Hull.

It is also the most bilingual (French-English) city in Canada.

==Toponomy==
In 1613, during his first passage on the Ottawa River, the great explorer Samuel de Champlain was the first European to speak of &quot;the river that comes from the north&quot;, traveled for millennia by Aboriginals, but he did not name it. In 1721, Canadian surveyor Noël Beaupré recorded the river, but did not give it a name. In short, the name Gatineau was not used in New France.

In fact, it was not until 1783 that the river was mentioned as Lettinoe in a report by Lieutenant David Jones to the Governor of Quebec, Sir Frederic Haldimand. In 1817, a map by Theodore Davis shows Gatteno, a name taken up with Gatino, Gateno and Gattino on plans by Philemon Wright, the founder of Hull Township, and by Lieutenant-Colonel John By, the engineer responsible for building the Rideau Canal.

It was not until 1821 that the name Gatineau first appeared on a map of Nepean Township, Ontario. The same name appears again on William Henderson&#x27;s map of 1831, and on another drawn 30 years later by surveyor Thomas Devine. Thereafter, the river was always referred to as the Gatineau.

There are two hypotheses to explain the origin of the city&#x27;s name. It would be either of Indigenous origin or of French origin:
# The name of the river and the city would come from the Anishinaabemowin (language of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg) Tenagatino Zibi, according to the elders of Kitigan Zibi.
# In his 1889 article published in the Echo de la Gatineau, Benjamin Sulte wrote: &quot;One hundred years ago, the Gatineau family was extinct, or thereabouts; it is hardly likely that we waited for its disappearance to consecrate the memory of the three or four fur traders it produced. The custom must have been established during the lifetime of these men, and because they traded in these places. Of the latter fact, for instance, I am not certain.&quot; In his own words, Sulte writes that he is creating a myth and that the story that the Gatineau family gave the river its name is a myth, invented by Sulte himself. According to Sulte, the name Gatineau comes from the Gastineau family - not Gatineau - one of its members, Nicolas Gastineau sieur Duplessis (1627-1689).

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the Gatineau area was inhabited by the Algonquin people which is part of the larger Anishinaabe. The current city of Gatineau is centred on an area formerly called Hull. It is the oldest European colonial settlement in the National Capital Region, but this area was essentially not developed by Europeans until after the American Revolutionary War, when the Crown granted land through the &quot;Leaders and Associates&quot; program of the Lower Canada Executive, which brought settlement in the Ottawa Valley.

Hull was founded on the north shore of the Ottawa River in 1800 by Philemon Wright at the portage around the Chaudière Falls, just upstream (or west) from the confluence of the Gatineau and Rideau rivers with the Ottawa River. Wright brought his family, four other families, and twenty-five (or 33, according to Philemon&#x27;s own conflicting reports) labourers with the hope of establishing an agricultural community, but by 1806, Wright and his family took advantage of the large forest stands and began the Ottawa River timber trade, floating the first square timber raft down the Ottawa River to Québec City. For a while, the industry was under a monopoly known as the Gatineau Privilege. The original settlement was called Wright&#x27;s Town, Lower Canada, and was later renamed as Hull, when it was incorporated in 1875. Bytown, founded in 1832, stood across the river from Wright&#x27;s Town. In 2002, after amalgamation, Hull became part of a larger jurisdiction named the City of Gatineau.

In 1820, before immigrants from Ireland and Great Britain arrived in great numbers, Hull Township had a population of 707; these included 365 men, 113 women, and 229 children. The high number of men were related to workers in the lumber trade. In 1824, there were 106 families and 803 persons. During the rest of the 1820s, the population of Hull doubled, with the arrival of Protestant immigrants from Ulster, now Northern Ireland. By 1851, the population of the County of Ottawa was 11,104, of which 2,811 lived in Hull. By comparison, Bytown had a population of 7,760 in 1851. By 1861, Ottawa County had a population of 15,671, of which 3,711 lived in Hull.

Gradually, French Canadians also migrated to the township; their proportion of the population increased from 10% in 1850, to 50% in 1870, and 90% in 1920. Industrial development in the mid-19th century attracted large numbers of French-Canadian workers to Hull.

The Gatineau River, like the Ottawa River, was a basic transportation resource for the &quot;draveurs&quot;, timber rafters who transported logs via the rivers from lumber camps to downriver destinations. (The Gatineau River flows south into the Ottawa River, which flows east to the St. Lawrence River near Montreal.) The log-filled Ottawa River, as viewed from Hull, was featured on the back of the Canadian one-dollar bill; the paper money was replaced by a dollar coin (the &quot;loonie&quot;) in 1987. The last of the dwindling activity of the draveurs on these rivers ended a few years later.

Very little remains of the original 1800 settlement of Hull because the oldest sectors of the town were destroyed by several fires, especially the destructive fire in 1900. The fire also seriously damaged the &quot;pont des Chaudières&quot; (&quot;Chaudière Bridge&quot;), but the bridge was rebuilt to join Ottawa to Hull at Victoria Island.

In the 1940s, during World War II, Hull, along with various other regions within Canada, such as Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, and Île Sainte-Hélène, was the site of prisoner-of-war camps. Hull&#x27;s prison was identified only by a number, as were Canada&#x27;s other war prisons. The prisoners of war (POWs) were organized by nationality and status: civilian or military status. In the Hull camp, POWs were mostly Italian and German nationals who were detained by the government as potential threats to the nation during the war. As a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1944, Canadians who had refused conscription were also interned in the camp. The prisoners were required to perform hard labour, which included farming and lumbering the land.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the decaying old downtown core of Hull was redeveloped. Old buildings were demolished and replaced by a series of large office complexes. In addition, some 4,000 residents were displaced, and many businesses uprooted along what was once the town&#x27;s main commercial area.

On 11 November 1992, Ghislaine Chénier, Mayor by interim for the city of Hull, unveiled &quot;War Never Again&quot;, a marble stele monument that commemorates the cost of war for the men, women and children of Hull.

== Geography ==
Gatineau is located in southwestern Quebec, on the northern bank of the Gatineau River. It is situated at an elevation of around The Gatineau Hills are the foothills of the Laurentian Mountains and located in the region. It is also the location of the third largest urban park in the world. They supply great skiing and snowboarding opportunities within minutes of the city. Gatineau is situated close to where the Canadian shield and the Saint Lawrence Lowlands intersect. The area has several major fault lines and small earthquakes do occur somewhat regularly, on average, there are at least one earthquake of intensity III or higher once every three years in Ottawa-Gatineau. The most memorable being the 2010 Central Canada earthquake that occurred in Quebec. The epicentre was situated approximately north of Ottawa, Ontario, in the municipality of Val-des-Bois, Quebec.

The city is covered in parks and green spaces. The beautiful Gatineau Park occupies almost 360 square kilometers of forest. The park offers hiking, biking, cross-country skiing and beaches. The Ottawa and Gatineau Rivers flow through Gatineau and Gatineau offers boat rides on the Ottawa River. Gatineau Park has 165 km of pathways and more than 200 km of groomed cross-country ski trails, making it one of the largest trail networks in North America.

=== Hydrography ===
Gatineau&#x27;s entire territory is drained by the Ottawa River, the main tributary of the St. Lawrence. The river marks the city&#x27;s southern boundary. To the southwest, it widens to form Lac Deschênes. The city is also crossed by several rivers: the Gatineau, the Lièvre and the Blanche. The territory is also criss-crossed by a dozen streams, including the ruisseau de la Brasserie, which forms an island in the downtown area.

There are several lakes in Gatineau, the most notable of which are Lac Leamy, Lac Beauchamp, Lac des Fées, Lac de la Carrière and Lac Pink. Pink is one of the few meromictic lakes in North America.

=== Climate ===
Gatineau has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with four distinct seasons and is between Zones 5a and 5b on the Canadian Plant Hardiness Scale. The climate in Gatineau is cold and temperate. Gatineau receives significant precipitation, even during the driest month. The average temperature in this city is .

Summer lasts from the end of June to the end of September. The precipitation peaks in June, with an average of 102 mm. From 21 May to 18 September, the warm season lasts 3.9 months, with an average daily high temperature above 20 °C. July is the hottest month in Gatineau, with average highs of 26 °C and lows of 15 °C.

=== Metropolitan area ===


Gatineau is one of the two major parts of the National Capital Region (), also known as Canada&#x27;s Capital Region and Ottawa–Gatineau; it is an official federal designation encompassing the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, the adjacent city of Gatineau, Quebec, and surrounding suburban and exurban areas. Which include larger urban communities such as Clarence-Rockland, Russell, North Grenville, Val-des-Monts and Cantley. It also includes smaller villages such as Bowman, Denholm, Lochaber and Val-des-Bois.

The National Capital Region has numerous attractions, including world-famous festivals, national museums, famous buildings and architecture, sports, and entertainment. Gatineau is home to the Canadian Museum of History, one of Canada&#x27;s most visited museums, designed by the architect Douglas Cardinal, a leading figure in contemporary Indigenous architecture.

==== Amalgamation ====
As part of the 2000–06 municipal reorganization in Quebec, the five municipalities that constituted the &quot;Communauté urbaine de l&#x27;Outaouais&quot; (&quot;Outaouais urban community&quot;) were merged on 1 January 2002 to constitute the new city of Gatineau. They were:
*Aylmer
*Buckingham
*Hull
*Gatineau
*Masson-Angers

Although Hull was the oldest and most central of the merged cities, the name Gatineau was chosen for the new city. The historic municipality of Gatineau had more residents than Hull, and this name was strongly associated with the area: it was the name of the former county, valley, hills, and park and the main river within the new city limits.

After the 2003 election, the new Liberal government of Jean Charest passed Bill 9, which created a process by which former municipalities could be reconstituted. Contrary to Charest&#x27;s election promise of full de-amalgamation, Bill 9 restored only selected powers to the de-merged cities (e.g., animal control, garbage pickup, local street maintenance, some cultural facilities). The bigger expenses (e.g., police, fire, main streets, expansion programs) and the majority of the taxes remained in the hands of urban agglomerations. These are controlled by the central merged city because their larger populations give them greater voting weight. In order to hold a referendum on dw-amalgamation, 10% of the eligible voters in each former municipality would have to sign a &quot;register&quot;.

Residents of Aylmer, Buckingham, Hull and Masson-Angers all surpassed this threshold and sought referendums on de-merge. A simple majority of &quot;yes&quot; votes, based on a turnout of at least 35% of voters, is needed to de-merge. All of the above jurisdictions had the required turnout. A majority of voters in each jurisdiction rejected the de-merger.
=== Neighbourhoods ===
Gatineau is divided into five sectors: Hull, Aylmer, Gatineau, Masson-Angers and Buckingham.

== Demography ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Gatineau had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to the 2011 census, the city of Gatineau had a population of 265,349. This was an increase of 9.6% compared to 2006. Most of the population live in the urban cores of Aylmer, Hull and the former Gatineau. Buckingham and Masson-Angers are more rural communities. Gatineau is the fourth largest city in Quebec after Montreal, Quebec City, and Laval.

The Quebec part of Ottawa-Gatineau Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) – which includes various peripheral municipalities in addition to Gatineau – had a total population of 314,501. Between 2001 and 2006, there was a net influx of 5,205 people (equivalent to 2% of the total 2001 population) who moved to Gatineau from outside of the Ottawa – Gatineau area. There was also a net outmigration of 630 anglophones (equivalent to 2% of the 2001 anglophone population). Overall, there was a net influx of 1,100 people from Quebec City, 1,060 from Montreal, 545 from Saguenay, 315 from Toronto, 240 from Trois-Rivières, 225 from Kingston, and 180 from Sudbury.

=== Ethnicity ===
The 2001 census found that 4.3% of the population self-identified as having a visible minority status, including, among others, about 1.3% who self-identified as Black, about 1.0% self-identifying as Arab, 0.5% as Latin American, 0.4% as Chinese, 0.3% as Southeast Asian, 0.2% as South Asian, and about 0.1% as Filipino. First Nations comprise 2.7% of the population. The area is home to more than five thousand recent immigrants (i.e. those arriving between 2001 and 2006), who now comprise about two percent of the total population. 11% of these new immigrants have come from Colombia, 10% from China, 7% from France, 6% from Lebanon, 6% from Romania, 4% from Algeria, 3% from the United States and 3% from Congo.

The cultural diversity of the city of Gatineau is noteworthy. The city welcomes between 800 and 1,000 newcomers to Canada each year. They come from some sixty countries and enrich the Gatineau identity.

Canadians were able to self-identify one or more ethnocultural ancestries in the 2001 census. (Percentages may therefore add up to more than 100%.) The most common response was Canadian/&quot;Canadien&quot;; as the term &quot;Canadian&quot; is as much an expression of citizenship as of ethnicity, these figures should not be considered an exact record of the relative prevalence of different ethnocultural ancestries. 43.1% of respondents gave a single response of Canadian/&quot;Canadien&quot; while a further 26.5% identified both Canadian/&quot;Canadien&quot; and one or more other ethnocultural ancestries. With regards to language, 10.4% of respondents gave a single response of French, 1.1% gave a single response of Portuguese, 1.0% gave a single response of Irish, 0.9% gave a single response of Lebanese, 0.8% gave a single response of English, 0.7% gave a single responses of &quot;Québécois&quot; and 0.7% gave a single response of North American Indian. According to Statistics Canada, counting both single and multiple responses, the most commonly identified ethnocultural ancestries were: 70.7% North American, 37.8% French, 14.3% British Isles, 4.5% Aboriginal, 4.0% Southern European, 3.8% Western European, 1.9% Arab, 1.7% Eastern European, 1.0% East and Southeast Asian, 0.8% African, 0.7% Latin, Central and South American, 0.7% Caribbean and 0.5% Northern European.

=== Language ===
The following statistics refer to the Quebec portion of the Ottawa–Gatineau CMA (as it was defined in the 2021 census). Counting both single and multiple responses, French was a mother tongue for 78.27% of residents in 2021, English for 16.96%, Arabic for 2.74%, Portuguese for 0.85% and Spanish for 2.0%.(Figures below are for single responses only.)

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Gatineau included:
*Christianity (178,850 persons or 62.6%)
*Irreligion (88,125 persons or 30.8%)
*Islam (14,840 persons or 5.2%)
*Buddhism (1,165 persons or 0.4%)
*Hinduism (535 persons or 0.2%)
*Judaism (405 persons or 0.1%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (200 persons or 0.1%)
*Sikhism (185 persons or 0.1%)
*Other (1,410 persons or 0.5%)

About 83% of the population identified as Roman Catholic in 2001, while 7% said they had no religion and 5% identified as Protestant (1.3% Anglican, 1.3% United, 0.7% Baptist, 0.3% Lutheran, 0.2% Pentecostal, 0.2% Presbyterian). About 1% of the population identified as Muslim, 0.5% as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, 0.3% as Buddhist, and 0.2% as Eastern Orthodox.

=== Immigration ===
There are a total of 44,180 immigrants (by status) in Gatineau (or 15.5% of the whole population) and 5,300 non-permanent residents.

==Economy==
Originally, Gatineau&#x27;s economy was based almost entirely on pulp and paper. However, a number of federal and provincial government offices are located in Gatineau, due to its proximity to the national capital, and its status as the main town of the Outaouais region of Quebec.

A policy of the federal government to distribute federal jobs on both sides of the Ottawa River led to the construction of several massive office towers to house federal civil servants in downtown Gatineau; the largest of these are Place du Portage and Terrasses de la Chaudière, occupying part of the downtown core of the city. Some government agencies and ministries headquartered in Gatineau are the Public Works and Government Services Canada, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, Environment Canada, Transportation Safety Board of Canada.

The following federal government departments have their main offices in Gatineau:

* Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada
* Canadian Heritage
* Employment and Social Development Canada
* Environment Canada (includes offices of Parks Canada)
* Public Works and Government Services Canada

The following agencies have their main offices in Gatineau.

* Transportation Safety Board of Canada
* Passport Canada (under Citizenship and Immigration Canada)
* Competition Bureau, the Canadian Patent Office and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (under Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada)

In addition to housing a significant portion of federal government offices, the city is also an important regional centre for the Outaouais region. The city serves as the location for the Superior Court of the District of Gatineau, which encompasses all neighboring municipalities. It also houses two of the region&#x27;s major hospitals as well as numerous provincial colleges.

Other important economic sectors are health care, tourism, education, small business and the provincial public service. The health care and education sectors are particularly important because they represent the region&#x27;s largest sources of permanent employment outside the federal government. The provincial public service also has a strong presence in the city, due to its status as the region&#x27;s principal city. There are two hospitals in the city, one in the Hull sector and the other in the Gatineau sector, as well as numerous other clinics and health centers. There are also numerous primary and secondary schools scattered throughout the city. They are managed by four school boards, three of which are French-speaking and one English-speaking. The city is also a major tourist region, with over a million tourists a year visiting the city&#x27;s museums, parks, lakes and other outdoor attractions.

The Gatineau-Ottawa metropolitan region has over 1,900 technology companies, employing close to 80,000 workers. There are also over 65 research centers and six universities with over 160,000 students (20% of whom are enrolled in science, engineering, and technology programs).

Gatineau&#x27;s economy relies on a few important sectors. A majority of jobs are accounted for between the federal government, construction and service industries. There is however a large effort to modernize the economy in the region through recent initiatives in the entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem. The Innovation Gatineau Institute is a regional innovation centre that boasts co-working space as well as startup incubation and acceleration programs to spur innovative business creation. In 2020, The Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, visited the Outaouais region to announce a total of $1,553,448 in financial assistance. This funding will help expand the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

==Arts and Culture==

Gatineau is home to many attractions and cultural events. It is home to national museums such as the Canadian Museum of History and the Canadian Children&#x27;s Museum. Nightlife within the city of Gatineau is mostly centered in the &quot;Vieux-Hull&quot; sector behind the Federal office complexes of downtown. The area features many bars and restaurants within walking distance from Ottawa. It is a popular spot for young Ontarians as the legal drinking age in Quebec is 18 (as opposed to 19 in Ontario).

=== Shopping ===

Gatineau is home to Les Promenades, which is located at the intersection of Gréber and Maloney Boulevards, one of the city&#x27;s busiest intersections, and is just off Autoroute 50. It is the city&#x27;s largest shopping mall by retail space and by shoppers.

=== Arenas and Performing arts ===
La maison de la culture is a multidisciplinary complex housing the Salle Odyssée. This 830-seat auditorium is the city&#x27;s main performance venue. The complex also houses the Art-Image exhibition center, the municipal library and many other cultural activities, such as dance and the Gatineau archives.

The newest multidisciplinary complex is called the Centre Slush Puppy. A 4,000-seat arena, including three community ice rinks managed by the non-profit organization Vision Multisports Outaouais, the management model is based on the signing of a 45-year emphyteutic lease. The building will be transferred to the City at the end of the lease. This arena not only hold the QMJHL hockey team Les Olympiques, but also host larger artists such as Flo Rida

=== Festivals ===
The Casino du Lac-Leamy is also one of the largest tourist attraction in the city. In August, the Casino hosts an international fireworks competition which opposes four different countries with the winner being awarded a &quot;Prix Zeus&quot; prize for the best overall show (based on several criteria) and can return in the following year. At the beginning of September, on Labour Day weekend, Gatineau hosts an annual hot air balloon festival which fills the skies with colourful gas-fired passenger balloons. One of Gatineau&#x27;s urban parks, Jacques Cartier Park, is used by the National Capital Commission during the popular festival, Winterlude. In December, the Gatineau Playground Festival takes place at Complex Branchaud-Brière in Gatineau. This one-of-a-kind event provides children and adults with 67,000 square feet of gaming, sports, go-karts, trampolines, and other activities.

=== Music ===
As Gatineau is the smaller of the two cities in its CMA, most major artists perform in Ottawa. However, since the construction of the Centre Slush Puppy, there has been a demand for more events. The first of which was Flo Rida; the rapper almost sold out the 5,000 capacity arena, with around 3,000 tickets sold.

Gatineau is home to numerous French-speaking and English-speaking artists. The biggest French artist are Eva Avila, Martin Giroux and Sofia Duhaime. As for English-speaking artist, they include artist such as Son Rob and YOHARIS.

=== Parks ===
There are many parks. Some of them are well gardened playgrounds or resting spaces while others, like Lac Beauchamp Park, are relatively wild green areas which often merge with the woods and fields of the surrounding municipalities. Streams of all sizes run through these natural expanses. Most of the city is on level ground but the Northern and Eastern parts lie on the beginnings of the foothills of the massive Canadian Shield, or Laurentian Mountains. These are the &quot;Gatineau Hills&quot;, and are visible in the background of the companion picture.

Gatineau is also the home of the second largest urban park in the world.

==Sports==
* Gatineau Fusion of the NRL (National Ringette League)
* Gatineau Olympiques of the &quot;QMJHL&quot; (Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League)
* Gatineau Jr. Olympiques (also known as &quot;Gatineau Junior Express&quot;) are a Canadian Junior ice hockey team based in Gatineau, Quebec. They play in the National Capital Junior Hockey League (NCJHL) since 2006.

* Beginning in 2010, the city began hosting an elite women&#x27;s two-race professional road cycling event, the Grand Prix Cycliste Gatineau, consisting of an individual time trial and a mass-start road race on separate days. Both races are rated 1.1 by the Union Cycliste Internationale, making them the highest ranked women&#x27;s road cycling events in North America. As of 2020, the race reorganized as the Tour de Gatineau, with the individual time trial portion now known as the Chrono Féminin de Gatineau.

== Government ==

The Gatineau City Council () is the city&#x27;s main governing body. It is composed of 19 city councillors and a mayor. The city serves as the seat of the judicial district of Gatineau, which encompasses the entirety of the city of Gatineau as well as several outlying municipalities such as Chelsea, Cantley and Pontiac. The superior court serving the Outaouais region is located in Gatineau across from City Hall on the corner of Laurier and Hôtel-de-Ville. Most of the law firms that represent local businesses throughout the region are also based in Gatineau. On February 22, 2024, the mayor of Gatineau, France Bélisle, handed her resignation stating a toxic work environment. In her place, Daniel Champagne was named acting mayor.


===Police and law enforcement===
With more than 250 officers, the &quot;Service de police de la Ville de Gatineau&quot; (SPVG) provides day-to-day policing for the city, in collaboration with other agencies such as the &quot;Sûreté du Québec&quot; and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police assisting as necessary. They are also responsible for patrolling sections of the highways located within the city limits, including Autoroute 50 and Autoroute 5. The SPVG is equipped with a CID unit, marine unit, drugs unit, gang suppression unit, and a tactical unit (Groupe d&#x27;intervention, or GI). Patrol officers are armed with Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P .40 calibre pistols. The SPVG uses the same vehicles as similar police forces throughout North America.

==== Crime ====
Ottawa and Gatineau have some of the lowest crime rates in Canada. In 2022, the national crime rate in Canada increased by 5% to 5,668 crimes per 100,000 people.

With a crime rate of 4,019 crimes per 100,000 people, Ottawa ranks 27th out of 35 cities in Canada. Gatineau is the 28th most dangerous city in Canada, with a crime rate of 3,737 crimes per 100,000 people.

==Infrastructure==

The Gatineau-Ottawa Executive Airport is Gatineau&#x27;s municipal airport, capable of handling small jets. There are Canada customs facilities for aircraft coming from outside Canada, a car rental counter and a restaurant. The airport has a few regularly scheduled flights to points within Quebec, but most residents of Gatineau use the nearby Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport or travel to Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Montreal.

=== Public transport ===

Ottawa and Gatineau have two distinct bus-based public transit systems with different fare structures, OC Transpo and the Société de transport de l&#x27;Outaouais. Tickets are not interchangeable between the two, however passes and transfers from one system to the other do not require payment of a surcharge on any routes. There is a proposed LRT system that would connect Gatineau to Bayview and Rideau Centre Stations in Ottawa.

=== Roads ===

Many Gatineau highways and major arteries feed directly into the bridges crossing over to Ottawa, but once there the roads lead into the dense downtown grid or into residential areas, with no direct connection to The Queensway. This difficulty is further magnified by the lack of a major highway on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River connecting Gatineau to Montreal, the metropolis of the province; most travellers from Gatineau to Montreal first cross over to Ottawa, and use Ontario highways to access Montreal. However, it is expected that since Autoroute 50 has been completed, the new link between Gatineau and the Laurentides popular tourist area may serve as part of a Montreal by-pass by the north shore for Outaouais residents.

==Education==
The education system in Quebec is different from other systems in Canada. It consists of six years of primary schooling and five years of secondary schooling, after which students must attend an additional school called CEGEP, or &quot;Collège d&#x27;enseignement général et professionnel&quot; if they want to access the province’s universities. CEGEPs offer both pre-university (two-year) and technical (three-year) programs.

With 28.3% of its population over 20 years of age having completed university studies, Gatineau is well ahead of the rest of the Canada. Gatineau also has one of the highest bilingualism rates, with 63.5% of its population fluent in both English and French.

The city of Gatineau, within its Hull neighborhood, houses the main campus of the Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO), part of the Université du Québec network. The UQO counts over 5,500 students, mostly within its multiple social science programs. It is world-renowned for its cyber-psychology laboratory. Faced with a limited number of domains of study, many Quebec students attend other universities, either in Ottawa or Montreal. Every year, the UQO hosts the Bar of Quebec course for certification of new lawyers.

Gatineau is also the home of two CEGEPs, including the francophone Cégep de l&#x27;Outaouais with three campuses across the city and the anglophone Heritage College.

The main French-language school boards in Gatineau are the Commission scolaire des Portages-de-l&#x27;Outaouais, the Commission scolaire au Coeur-des-Vallées, and the Commission scolaire des Draveurs. There are also four private high schools: the all-girl Collège Saint-Joseph, the Collège Saint-Alexandre, and École secondaire Nouvelles-Frontières and le Centre académique de l&#x27;Outaouais (CADO). Elementary and secondary education in English is held under the supervision of the Western Quebec School Board.

Since 1995, the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) has a campus in Gatineau. A military training centre, Defence Public Affairs Learning Centre, is also located in Gatineau.

===Campus médical Outaouais===
In 2019, McGill University announced the construction of a new campus for its Faculty of Medicine in the Outaouais region, which will run the undergraduate medical education program in French and allow students to complete their undergraduate medical training entirely in the Outaouais. Official communication with politicians has been ongoing since 2016. The new facility will be erected above the emergency room at the Gatineau Hospital, part of the Centre intégré de santé et de services sociaux de l&#x27;Outaouais, in addition to new offices for the associated Family Medicine Unit for residency training. Although the preparatory year for students entering the undergraduate medical education program from CEGEP was initially planned to be offered solely at the McGill downtown campus in Montreal, collaboration with the Université du Québec en Outaouais finally made it possible to offer the program entirely in Gatineau.

===Key roads===
==Media==
Gatineau is the city of licence for several television and radio stations serving the National Capital Region, which is a single media market. Many of the Ottawa-Gatineau region&#x27;s TV and FM broadcast stations transmit from Camp Fortune just north of Gatineau. All of the stations licensed directly to Gatineau broadcast in French.

Weekly newspapers published in Gatineau include &quot;Le Bulletin d&#x27;Aylmer&quot; (bilingual) and &quot;The West Quebec Post&quot;. Although Gatineau does not have its own daily newspaper, it is served by daily newspapers published in Ottawa, including the French &quot;Le Droit&quot; and the English &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; and &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot;.

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the Canadian regulatory agency for broadcasting, is based in Gatineau at Terrasses de la Chaudière.

<text>A chocolate bar is a confection containing chocolate, which may also contain layerings or mixtures that include nuts, fruit, caramel, nougat, and wafers. A flat, easily breakable, chocolate bar is also called a tablet. In some varieties of English and food labeling standards, the term &quot;chocolate bar&quot; is reserved for bars of solid chocolate, with &quot;candy bar&quot; used for products with additional ingredients.

The manufacture of a chocolate bar from raw cocoa ingredients requires many steps, from grinding and refining, to conching and tempering. All these processes have been independently developed by chocolate manufacturers from different countries. There is therefore no precise moment when the first chocolate bar came into existence. Solid chocolate was already consumed in the 18th century. The 19th century saw the emergence of the modern chocolate industry; most manufacturing techniques used today were invented during this period.

Dark, milk and white are the main three types of chocolate. Ingredients not derived from cocoa have been added to bars since the beginning of the chocolate industry, often to reduce production costs. A wide variety of chocolate bar brands are sold today.

==Terminology==
In many varieties of English, &quot;chocolate bar&quot; refers to any confectionery bar that contains chocolate. In some dialects of American English, only bars of solid chocolate are described as &quot;chocolate bars&quot;, with the phrase &quot;candy bar&quot; used as a broader term encompassing bars of solid chocolate, bars combining chocolate with other ingredients, and bars containing no chocolate at all. In Canada, while the term &quot;chocolate bar&quot; is commonly used for bars combining chocolate with other ingredients, only bars of solid chocolate can be labelled as a chocolate bar.

The term &quot;bar&quot; may refer to a large variety of shapes, including not oblong ones, such as squares. Small (bite-sized) chocolate pieces are however usually referred to as &quot;chocolates&quot;, regardless of shape. These include neapolitans, bonbons, pralines and truffles.

&quot;Cake chocolate&quot; is an old commercial designation for solid chocolate.

==History==
===Early history===

Solid chocolate was probably already consumed in pre-Columbian America, in particular by the Aztecs, despite the beverage being the traditional form of consumption of cocoa in Mesoamerica. In fact, any finely ground cocoa that is not immediately used to make a drink turns into solid chocolate. The grinding of the cocoa beans was done with a stone metate. Dominican friar Diego Durán mentions in his writings that Aztec soldiers carried small balls of ground cocoa among other military rations. Cocoa was introduced into Europe in the early 16th century, possibly already under its processed (solid) form.

Until the 18th century, chocolate was essentially consumed as a drink. Transport of cocoa beans was slow and difficult, therefore making the product very expensive in Europe. Chocolate was usually sold as a solidified ground but still grainy cocoa paste (in the form of blocks, sticks or balls) to be dissolved in water or milk, either plain or already sweetened and flavoured. It is unclear when bars or tablets of chocolate (meant to be eaten straight as a candy rather than grated into a drink) were made for the first time. It is known, however, that the consumption of solid chocolate by the wealthy increased by the end of the 18th century.
The production of chocolate specifically meant to be eaten in bars may predate the French Revolution. The Marquis de Sade wrote to his wife in a letter dated May 16, 1779, complaining about the quality of a care package he had received while in prison. Among the requests that he made for future deliveries were for cookies that &quot;must smell of chocolate, as if one were biting into a chocolate bar.&quot; This phrasing is highly suggestive of chocolate bars being eaten by themselves and not just grated into chocolate-based drinks. Another illustration is given by a contemporary encyclopedia, which mentions &quot;bonbons&quot;, &quot;chocolate-covered pistachios&quot; and &quot;white chocolate&quot;. Such products would predate the invention of the cocoa press and the &quot;Dutch cocoa&quot; by Coenraad Johannes van Houten and other innovations which made chocolate suitable for mass-production.

Up to and including the 19th century, confectionery of all sorts was typically sold in small pieces to be bagged and bought by weight. The introduction of chocolate as something that could be eaten as is, rather than used to make beverages or desserts, resulted in the earliest bar forms, or tablets. At some point, &quot;chocolates&quot; came to mean any chocolate-covered sweets, whether nuts, creams (fondant), caramel candies, or others. The chocolate bar evolved from all of these in the late-19th century as a way of packaging and selling candy more conveniently for both buyer and seller; however, the buyer had to pay for the packaging. It was considerably cheaper to buy candy loose, or in bulk.

===First mass-produced chocolate bars===

The late 18th century saw the beginning of the mechanization of chocolate manufacturing. Water and wind power was used first, steam-powered machines followed. This not only allowed the production of chocolate on a larger scale, but also the production of chocolate with a finer texture. Among the pioneers were Joseph Storrs Fry, who patented a method of grinding cocoa beans using a Watt steam engine in 1795, and Poincelet, who invented the melanger in 1811, soon adopted by most chocolate manufacturers.

In the early 19th century, several chocolate manufacturers are credited for technical improvements or novelties. François-Louis Cailler, who founded the Cailler factory in 1819 in Switzerland, sold assortments of chocolate tablets. Shortly after, in 1826, another Swiss chocolatier, Philippe Suchard, founded the Suchard factory where he used and developed the melanger. The same year, Pierre Paul Caffarel founded the Caffarel factory in Italy, using a new grinding machine, also allowing him to increase production. During that decade, in England, Fry &amp; Sons introduced chocolate lozenges as a &quot;substitute for food when travelling&quot;.

1828 is the year of a major breakthrough: Casparus van Houten patented an effective method for pressing the fat from roasted cocoa beans. The centre of the bean, known as the &quot;nib&quot;, contains an average of 54 percent cocoa butter. Van Houten&#x27;s machine – the hydraulic cocoa press – reduced the cocoa butter content by nearly half. This not only allowed the creation of defatted cocoa powder (to be used for chocolate drinks), but also the creation of pure cocoa butter on a large scale. The additional cocoa butter (mixed with cocoa liquor and sugar) would allow the production of chocolate with a higher fluidity, therefore with a higher moldability into more complex shapes. It is not known when the first chocolate with added cocoa butter was manufactured. However, in 1832, the first workshop for producing chocolate moulds opened in Paris, testifying to the increasing use of chocolate in confectionery, especially in France.

An American magazine from 1836 notes that (small and sweetened) chocolate bars have become popular in France for their nutritious quality and portability.
In the 1830s, French pharmacist Antoine Brutus Menier, who first used chocolate as a coating for pills, developed a chocolate factory in Noisiel. In 1836, a yellow-wrapped chocolate tablet with six semi-cylindrical divisions is launched, possibly already using additional cocoa butter. By the 1840s the production of a wide variety of chocolate bars and bonbons is attested. Semi-finished products like finely ground cocoa liquor and cocoa butter were also sold by Menier. Menier&#x27;s tablets beared a trademark to protect them from counterfeits. By the 1860s, production reached 2,500 tonnes, a quarter of the country’s total output, much of it exported. French assortments dominated the confectionery market until the appearance of milk chocolate in the 1890s.
In the 1840s, British manufacturers adopted eating chocolate to counter the popularity of French imports. In 1842, John Cadbury sold &quot;French Eating Chocolate&quot;. He was followed by Joseph Fry who sold &quot;Chocolat Délicieux à Manger&quot; (&quot;delicious eating chocolate&quot;) in 1847. The latter, probably made with additional cocoa butter, is often considered the first modern chocolate bar, although it was not successful. In 1849, both Fry and Cadbury chocolates were displayed publicly at a trade fair in Bingley Hall, Birmingham. Meanwhile, the Walter Baker company introduced sweetened chocolate bars during the California gold rush, popularising chocolate as an everyday food in the United States.
Fry&#x27;s chocolate factory in Bristol, J. S. Fry &amp; Sons, began the mass-production of various chocolate candies, notably Fry&#x27;s Cream Sticks released in 1853, which led to the Fry&#x27;s Chocolate Cream bar in 1866. The production of eating chocolate rose from about 10 tonnes in 1852 to over 1,100 tonnes in 1880; a Van Houten press was acquired and installed in 1868, two years after its competitor, Cadbury, installed his. Other products included the first chocolate Easter egg in the UK in 1873, and Fry&#x27;s Turkish Delight (or Fry&#x27;s Turkish bar) in 1914.

In addition to Cadbury and Fry, Rowntree&#x27;s and Terry&#x27;s were major British chocolate companies, as chocolate manufacturing expanded in England throughout the rest of the century.

===Modern chocolate bars===
Rodolphe Lindt, a Swiss confectioner, discovered the conching process in 1879. Conching evenly blends cocoa butter with cocoa solids and sugar, therefore making the chocolate perfectly smooth. At first a trade secret, it became a standard process in the chocolate industry by the 1920s. The last stage of chocolate manufacturing, tempering, was also developed at around this time. Tempering allows the production of chocolate that is perfectly hard at room temperature and that have an attractive shiny appearance.
A few years earlier, in 1875, milk chocolate makes its appearance. It was developed by another Swiss confectioner, Daniel Peter. He was able to make milk chocolate with the help of his neighbour Henri Nestlé, who was specialized in dehydrated milk products. Daniel Peter launched his successful Gala Peter brand in 1887. Cailler and Suchard followed in the late 19th century, and other factories opened in Switzerland at that time.

In 1897, following the lead of Swiss companies, Cadbury introduced its own line of milk chocolate bars in the UK. Cadbury Dairy Milk, first produced in 1905, became the company&#x27;s best selling bar.

In the United States, immigrants who arrived with candy-making skills drove the development of new chocolate bars. Milton S. Hershey, a Pennsylvania caramel maker, saw a German-manufactured chocolate-making machine at the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. He immediately ordered one for his Lancaster factory and produced the first American-made milk chocolate bar.

Chocolate bar sales grew rapidly in the early-20th century. During World War I, the U.S. Army commissioned a number of American chocolate makers to produce 40 pound blocks of chocolate. These were shipped to Army quartermaster bases and distributed to the troops stationed throughout Europe. When the soldiers returned home, their demand for chocolate contributed to the increasing popularity of the chocolate bar.

===Combination bars===

The first chocolate bars were plain chocolate, but often flavoured with spices, such as cinnamon and vanilla. Producers soon began combining chocolate with other ingredients such as nuts, fruit, caramel, nougat, and wafers. In 1830, Kohler added hazelnuts to chocolate bars and, in 1852, Caffarel added hazelnuts as a smooth paste to its chocolate, creating gianduja. Adding other, usually cheaper, ingredients to bars was also a way to reduce production costs. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of combination bars use milk chocolate, which further decreases the amount of cocoa in the finished product. Approximately 30,000 varieties of candy bars existed in the United States during the 1920s, most of which were produced locally.

A wide selection of similar chocolate snacks or nutritional supplements are produced with added sources of protein and vitamins, including energy bars, protein bars and granola bars.

*The Fry&#x27;s Chocolate Cream, produced by J. S. Fry &amp; Sons since 1866, consisted of a plain fondant centre enrobed in plain chocolate. It is the first mass-produced chocolate bar and predates the invention of milk chocolate.
*The Branche, created by Kohler and produced by Cailler since 1904, is a cylindrical and branch-looking milk chocolate and hazelnut bar with a praline filling, partly made with recycled broken confectionery. As a consequence of its wide success, &quot;branche&quot; has become a generic term (in French) for any stick-like chocolate bar.
*The Toblerone, produced by Tobler since 1908, is a combination of milk chocolate and torrone, a white nougat made of honey, almonds and egg whites. Its manufacture and distinctive triangular shape was patented at the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property.
*The Goo Goo Cluster, produced by the Standard Candy Company of Nashville, Tennessee, in 1912, was the first combination bar in the United States. It was made of caramel, marshmallow, and peanuts, covered with milk chocolate. The combination of peanuts with chocolate became very popular in North America, while the hazelnut remained the most popular pairing in Europe.
*The Clark Bar, a crispy core with caramel and peanut butter covered with milk chocolate, was the first nationally marketed combination bar in the United States.
*The Oh Henry! bar was created by George Williamson of Williamson Candy Co. and named after an electrician who visited his store and flirted with the female candy makers. Williamson launched an advertising campaign that included newspaper ads, streetcar signs, and billboards. The Oh Henry! bar became one of the top-selling brands in the United States in the 1920s. In 1926, the company published a book, &quot;60 New Ways to Serve a Famous Candy&quot;, that included recipes for salads, side dishes, and sweet breads, in addition to desserts.
*The Baby Ruth was developed by Otto Schnering, owner of the Curtiss Candy Co., by modifying their original candy bar, Kandy Kake, to compete with the Oh Henry! bar. Schnering claimed that the Baby Ruth was named in honor of President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s daughter, who died at age 12, but some historians suggest that Schnering chose the name to take advantage of the popularity of Babe Ruth without having to pay royalties. Schnering decided to sell his bar for half the price of its competitor, hiring legendary Chicago ad man, Eddy S. Brandt, to market the Baby Ruth under the slogan &quot;Everything you want for a nickel.&quot; The catchy slogan, along with other innovative marketing tactics, like sponsoring circuses and dropping Baby Ruth bars over cities from airplanes, made Baby Ruth the most popular candy bar in the U.S by 1925.
*The Mars bar was introduced by Mars, Incorporated in 1932 in Slough, England, by Forrest Mars, Sr. It consists of caramel and nougat coated with milk chocolate.
*The Kit Kat bar, created by Rowntree&#x27;s in 1935, is a milk chocolate-covered wafer bar. The bar consists of two or four fingers that can be snapped from the bar separately. Kit Kat bars are reputed for being made in many different flavours.

==Ingredients==

A solid chocolate bar is typically made with some or all of the following ingredients: cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, sugar, and milk. The relative presence or absence of these define the subclasses of chocolate bar made of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate. In addition to these main ingredients a solid chocolate bar may contain flavorings such as vanilla and emulsifiers such as soy lecithin to alter its consistency. Some chocolate bars contain added milk fat, to make the chocolate softer, since milk fat is a softer fat than cocoa butter. While sugar is commonly used as a sweetener for chocolate bars, some chocolate bars use sugar alcohols, such as maltitol as an alternative.

Compound chocolate, which uses vegetable oils in place of cocoa butter, may be used as a less expensive alternative to true chocolate, though such a product may not be able to be labelled as &quot;chocolate&quot;. Combination bars may contain a wide variety of additional ingredients.

== Popular culture ==
===Literature and film===
The Wonka Bar was introduced as a fictional chocolate bar that served as a key story point in the 1964 novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; by Roald Dahl. Wonka Bars appear in both film adaptations of the novel, &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971) and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005). Wonka Bars were subsequently manufactured and sold in the real world, formerly by the Willy Wonka Candy Company, a division of Nestlé.

==Records==
===Oldest extant===

Some of the oldest preserved chocolate bars are two pieces of white and dark chocolate made between 1764 and 1795 for the king of Poland, Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski, as a gift for his courtiers. Each bar, possibly made by the royal confectioner in Warsaw, bears the King&#x27;s monogram, &quot;SAR&quot;, and is on display in his summer residence, Palace on the Water, in Warsaw.

=== World&#x27;s largest ===
The world&#x27;s largest chocolate bar was produced as a stunt by Thorntons plc (UK) on 7 October 2011. It weighed and measured 4m by 4m by 0.35m.

On January 16, 2020, Mars Inc. received the Guinness World Record for largest chocolate nut bar. They produced a 12-foot by 27.5-inch by 27.5-inch Snickers that weighed 4,728 lbs which is the equivalent of 41,000 single-size Snickers.

On January 31, 2020, the Hershey Company beat the Guinness World Record for largest chocolate nut bar surpassing Mars Inc.&#x27;s Gigantic Snickers bar with a gigantic Reese&#x27;s Take 5 Bar measuring 9 by 5.5 by 2 feet and weighing 5,943 lbs. The Take 5 chocolate bar gets its name from the 5 ingredients it contains: Reese&#x27;s peanut butter, peanuts, pretzels, caramel and chocolate.

<text>Cannae (now , ) is an ancient village of the region of south east Italy. It is a (civil parish) of the (municipality) of . Cannae was formerly a bishopric, and is a Latin Catholic titular see (as of 2022).

== Geography ==

The commune of Cannae is situated near the river (ancient names or ), on a hill on the right (i.e., south) bank, southwest of its mouth, and southwest of .

== History ==
It is primarily known for the Battle of Cannae, in which the numerically superior Roman army suffered a disastrous defeat by Hannibal in 216BC. There is a considerable controversy as to whether the battle took place on the right or the left bank of the river.

In later times the place became a , and the remains of an unimportant Roman town still exist upon the hill known as . In the Middle Ages, probably after the destruction of in the 9th century, it became a bishopric, and again saw military action in the second battle of Cannae, twelve centuries after the more famous one (1018). The Byzantine , , successfully drove off the invading Lombard and Norman army. The town was wrecked in 1083 by Robert Guiscard, who left only the cathedral and bishop&#x27;s residence, and was ultimately destroyed in 1276.

<doc id="100712" wikidata="Q1972045" url="?curid=100712" title="Banns of marriage">
<text>The banns of marriage, commonly known simply as the &quot;banns&quot; or &quot;bans&quot; (from a Middle English word meaning &quot;proclamation&quot;, rooted in Frankish and thence in Old French), are the public announcement in a Christian parish church, or in the town council, of an impending marriage between two specified persons. It is commonly associated with the Catholic Church, the Church of Sweden (Lutheran), the Church of England (Anglican), and with other Christian denominations whose traditions are similar. In 1983, the Catholic Church removed the requirement for banns and left it to individual national bishops&#x27; conferences to decide whether to continue the practice, but in most Catholic countries the banns are still published.

The purpose of banns is to enable anyone to raise any canonical or civil legal impediments to the marriage, so as to prevent invalid marriages. Impediments vary between legal jurisdictions, but would normally include a pre-existing marriage that has been neither dissolved nor annulled, a vow of celibacy, lack of consent, or the couple being related within a prohibited degree of kinship.

== Historical overview ==

=== Roman Catholic ===
The original Catholic Canon law on the subject, intended to prevent clandestine marriages, was decreed in Canon 51 of the Lateran IV Council in 1215; until then, the public announcement in church of marriages to be contracted was only made in some areas. The Council of Trent on 11 November 1563 (Sess. XXIV, De ref. matr., c. i) made the provisions more precise: before the celebration of any marriage, the names of the contracting parties should be announced publicly in the church during Mass, by the parish priests of both parties on three consecutive Holy Days. Although the requirement was straightforward in canon law, complications sometimes arose in a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Catholic, when one of the parties to the marriage did not have a home parish in the Roman Catholic Church.

Traditionally, banns were read from the pulpit and were usually published in the parish weekly bulletin. Before 1983, canon law required banns to be announced, or &quot;asked&quot;, in the home parishes of both parties on three Sundays or Holy Days of Obligation before the marriage. Under Canon 1067 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, the norms regarding the publication of banns are to be established by each individual national or regional Conference of bishops.

In some places, the words once spoken by the priest were: &quot;I publish the banns of marriage between (Name of party) of the Parish of... and (Name of other party) of this Parish. If any of you know cause or just impediment why these persons should not be joined together in Holy Matrimony, ye are to declare it. This is for the (first, second, third) time of asking.&quot;

Marriage licenses were introduced in the 14th century, to allow the usual notice period under banns to be waived, on payment of a fee and accompanied by a sworn declaration that there was no canonical impediment to the marriage.

===Anglican===
While the Council of Trent is best known as a Counter-Reformation Council, neither the Lutheran Church nor the Church of England broke with the Roman Catholic Church on the requirement of publication of banns (or the equivalent) before marriage. (An equivalent notice was not required in the Orthodox Christian Churches, which used another method to verify eligibility to marry.) The break between some Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church was over what would constitute an impediment to marriage (the Church of England, for example, recognised remarriage after divorce in some circumstances), rather than over the means by which impediments to marriage should be identified.

In England, under the provisions of the Clandestine Marriages Act 1753 (26 Geo. 2. c. 33), a marriage was only legally valid if the banns had been called or a marriage licence had been obtained, codifying earlier practice within the Church of England. By this law, the banns were required to be read aloud on three Sundays before the wedding ceremony, in the home parish churches of both parties. Omission of this formality rendered the marriage void, unless the bishop&#x27;s licence (a &quot;common licence&quot;) or the special licence of the Archbishop of Canterbury had been obtained. This statutory requirement had the effect of requiring Roman Catholics and other non-conformists to be married in the Church of England, a requirement lifted by legislation in 1836.

Before 1754, when the Clandestine Marriages Act 1753 came into force, it was possible for eloping couples to be married clandestinely by an ordained clergyman (a favourite location was the Fleet Prison, a debtors&#x27; prison in London, in which clergymen willing to celebrate irregular marriages might be found). After the law, elopers had to leave England and Wales in order to contract a marriage while avoiding these formalities. Scotland, in particular Gretna Green, the first village over the border from England, was the customary destination, but became less popular after 1856 when Scottish law was amended to require 21 days&#x27; residence. The Isle of Man was briefly popular also, but in 1757 Tynwald, the island&#x27;s legislature, passed a similar Act, with the additional sanction of pillorying and ear-cropping for clergymen from overseas who married couples without banns. These details often figure in melodramatic literature set in the period.

In 1656 (during the Commonwealth or Protectorate period) the parish register of St Mary le Crypt in Gloucester records banns of marriage as being &quot;published by the Bellman&quot; – the Town Crier.

The wording of banns according to the rites of the Church of England is as follows:
* I publish the banns of marriage between NN of ... and NN of ...
** This is the first / second / third time of asking. If any of you know cause or just impediment why these two persons should not be joined in Holy Matrimony, ye are to declare it. (Book of Common Prayer 1662) &quot;or&quot;
** This is the first / second / third time of asking. If any of you know any reason in law why they may not marry each other you are to declare it. (Common Worship 2000)

Royal assent was given to the &quot;Church of England Marriage (Amendment) Measure&quot; on 19 December 2012. Prior to that, as only the Prayer Book words were enshrined in the Marriage Act 1949, that wording should arguably have been used. However, in their notes to the 2012 Measure, the Church of England&#x27;s legal Office stated &quot;In some places the alternative form, as set out in Common Worship, has been in use for some time. There is no legal difficulty with marriages that have been solemnized following the publication of the banns in that form as the legal substance of the words is the same as the form contained in the Book of Common Prayer. However there will now be a statutory basis of the use of the alternative form.&quot;
The 2012 measure gave effect to two changes:

# Statutory authority for the use of the form of words for the publication of banns contained in Common Worship: Pastoral Services (as an optional alternative to the form of words contained in the Book of Common Prayer);
# Banns must be published on three Sundays at the &#x27;principal service&#x27; (rather than as previously at &#x27;morning service&#x27;) and, as an option, they may additionally be published at any other service on those three Sundays.

===Methodist===
The Sunday Service of the Methodists, the first liturgical text of Methodism, contains &quot;the opening rubric of the Prayer Book rite requiring the publication of banns, by which impediments to marriage such as consanguinity and legal betrothal to another could be revealed and investigated.&quot; These banns are to be read &quot;over a period of three Sundays&quot; during &quot;the time of divine service&quot;.

The African Methodist Episcopal Church (through its publication of the 1996 &quot;Book of Discipline&quot;) and Free Methodist Church, both members of the World Methodist Council, contain a rubric for the reading of the banns:
==Country-by-country overviews==

===England and Wales===
The present legislation relating to banns of marriage is contained in the Marriage Act 1949 as amended by the Church of England Marriage (Amendment) Measure 2012.

===United States===
Banns were common requirement during the colonial era. Plymouth Colony&#x27;s first marriage regulation (1636) required the banns to be read to the congregation three times, or if no congregation was in the area, publicly posted for a fifteen-day period. Quakers were allowed to announce banns in their meetinghouses. Noncompliance with the banns procedure carried a serious fine in the 17th century, which could be imposed upon the groom or minister. The proclaiming of the banns of marriage was also a requirement in the Dutch colony of New Netherland.

By the 19th and 20th centuries, the practice of announcing banns faded, as most religious denominations abandoned the practice or made it optional. Banns were superseded by the rise of civil marriage license requirements, which served a similar purpose: &quot;a declaration that no legal impediment exists to the marriages.&quot; Elizabeth Freedman identifies the mid-19th century as the era in which &quot;[g]overnmental regulation of marriage in the United States intensified&quot; and the U.S. &quot;reestablished jurisdiction over marriage by reviving the policing function that banns had once had, developing a series of prenuptial tests that would determine the fitness of the couple to marry...&quot;

===Canada===
In the Canadian province of Ontario, the publication of banns &quot;proclaimed openly in an audible voice during divine service&quot; in the church(es) of the betrothed remains a legal alternative to obtaining a marriage licence. This was the procedure followed by the first few same-sex marriages in Ontario, since the province was not then issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples. The marriages were ruled valid in 2003. Banns being read once in a church ordinarily attended by both parties to the marriage is also allowed in lieu of a licence in Manitoba.

In the Canadian province of Quebec, equivalent formalities are required for &quot;all&quot; marriages, although the Civil code does not use the word &quot;banns&quot;. The government does not issue licences; instead a written notice must be posted at the place of the wedding for 20 days beforehand, and the officiant verifies the eligibility of the intended spouses.

In British Columbia, only Doukhobors can be married by banns.

===Civil-law countries in general===
Many civil-law countries have different, secular pre-marriage registration and publication requirements.

===Belgium===
In Belgium the publication requirement was introduced in 1796 and removed in 2000.

===Finland===
In Finland, a forthcoming marriage was required to be announced in the home parish church of the bride on three consecutive Sundays prior to the wedding. This requirement ended with the 1988 marriage law , but the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland continues to practise the tradition unless the couple request otherwise. The Finnish term for the banns is &quot;kuulutus avioliittoon&quot; (literally &#x27;announcement into marriage&#x27;), or &quot;kuulutukset&quot; more shortly and colloquially.

===France===
French civil law requires the publication of banns of marriage in the towns where intended spouses are living. It should be displayed in the town hall ten days before the marriage.

===Germany===
German civil law required the publication of banns of marriage until 1998. The process was called &quot;das bestellen&quot;. Presently, couples must still register for civil marriage beforehand, which has the same effect of ruling out immediate marriage. Still, a public proclamation or posting isn&#x27;t necessary anymore.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there is a statutory requirement for couples intending to marry to formally register that intention with officials beforehand. This process is called &quot;ondertrouw&quot;.

==Other uses==
A second use of &quot;the banns&quot; is as the prologue to a play, i.e., a proclamation made at the beginning of a medieval play announcing and summarizing the upcoming play. An example can be found in the Croxton &quot;Play of the Sacrament&quot;, a Middle English miracle play written sometime after 1461.

<text>Route 36 is a state highway in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. The long route, shaped as a backwards C, begins at an intersection of the Garden State Parkway and Hope Road (County Route 51) on the border of Tinton Falls and Eatontown and runs east to Long Branch. From Long Branch, the route follows the Atlantic Ocean north to Sea Bright and turns west, running to the south of the Raritan Bay. Route 36 ends in Keyport at an interchange with the Garden State Parkway and Route 35. It varies in width from a six-lane divided highway to a two-lane undivided road. The route is signed east–west between Eatontown and Long Branch and north–south between Long Branch and Keyport.

Route 36 was created in 1927 to run from Keyport to Highlands along a winding route that went through the downtowns of Keyport, Keansburg, and Atlantic Highlands. In 1929, the route was modified to bypass the downtown areas. Route 36 was extended to Eatontown in 1940 with only the portion within Eatontown and West Long Branch built. The remainder of the route was created with the takeover of Joline Avenue in Long Branch and Ocean Avenue in Monmouth Beach and Sea Bright from Monmouth County on October 17, 1972, and the completion of Ocean Boulevard in Long Branch in late 1983.

==Route description==

Route 36 begins at the intersection of Hope Road (CR 51) and exit 105 on the Garden State Parkway in Eatontown, heading east along a four-lane divided highway. Soon after beginning, it features ramps that provide access to Route 18 in both the westbound and eastbound directions. The route widens to six lanes and crosses the intersection of Wyckoff Road (CR 547). After that intersection, Route 36 passes by the Monmouth Mall and intersects with Route 35 at the former Eatontown Circle, which has been reconstructed to an at-grade intersection with ramps. Route 36 continues east through commercial development and crosses into West Long Branch, where it comes to an intersection of Monmouth Road (Route 71). The route heads northeast, passing by Shore Regional High School, and crosses the intersection of Eatontown Boulevard/Broadway (CR 547). Route 36 meets the intersection of Oceanport Avenue (CR 11) and comes to the entrance to the Monmouth Park Racetrack.

Route 36 narrows to a two-lane undivided highway and crosses into Long Branch, where it becomes Joline Avenue. In Long Branch, the route crosses the intersection of Myrtle Avenue and NJ Transit’s North Jersey Coast Line. Route 36 heads toward the Atlantic Ocean, where it intersects with Ocean Boulevard (CR 57), the route turns north and runs along the Atlantic Ocean on Ocean Boulevard, a four-lane divided road. Route 36 intersects with Atlantic Avenue (CR 29) and crosses into Monmouth Beach, where it narrows to a two-lane undivided road and becomes Ocean Avenue. It continues through Monmouth Beach, where it runs just west of the Sea Bright–Monmouth Beach Seawall separating the road from the ocean, and enters Sea Bright. Here, Route 36 heads north onto a narrow peninsula between the Shrewsbury River and the Atlantic Ocean, meeting the intersection of Rumson Road (CR 520). The route continues north along the peninsula to a trumpet interchange that provides access to Gateway National Recreation Area at Sandy Hook.
Route 36 turns west and crosses the Shrewsbury River on the four-lane Highlands–Sea Bright Bridge, continuing into Highlands. It interchanges with Bay Avenue (CR 8) and continues west on a four-lane divided highway with a jersey barrier and some intersections featuring jughandles that runs a short distance to the south of the Raritan Bay. The route then forms the border between Highlands and Middletown, with Highlands to the north and Middletown to the south. Route 36 intersects two separate sections of CR 8, Linden Avenue and Ocean Boulevard soon after, before intersecting with Navesink Avenue (CR 8B) and fully entering Middletown. Route 36 continues as Memorial Parkway, and crosses into Atlantic Highlands. In Atlantic Highlands, the route intersects with Valley Drive East (CR 8A) and First Avenue (CR 8). It crosses back into Middletown and meets the intersection of Leonardville Road (CR 516).

Route 36 passes under Normandy Road, which serves as a road and railroad link between the two sections of Naval Weapons Station Earle, with an entrance present to Normandy Road. The route drops Memorial Parkway and meets the intersection of Thompson Avenue (CR 36). It crosses the intersection of Palmer Avenue/Main Street (CR 7) and forms the border between Hazlet to the south and Keansburg to the north. Route 36 eventually fully enters Hazlet and intersects with Monroe Avenue (CR 7). The route then forms the border between Hazlet to the south and Union Beach to the north and passes over Natco Lake. It intersects with Union Avenue (CR 39) and then Stone Road (CR 6), where Route 36 fully enters Hazlet again. The route crosses the intersection of Middle Road (CR 516) and passes between an Academy Bus Lines terminal to the north and a shopping center that contains a park and ride lot to the south before it enters Keyport. Route 36 intersects with Broad Street (CR 4) and continues to its terminus at an interchange with Route 35 and the Garden State Parkway at exit 117. The overall shape of Route 36 is that of a backwards C.

==History==

=== Ocean Boulevard / Route 16 ===

What is now Route 36 from Atlantic Highlands to Long Branch was part of the Jersey Coast Way, which ran from the Staten Island Ferry to Cape May.

In January 1916, State Senator Henry E. Ackerson Jr. introduced a bill to extend Ocean Boulevard from Bay Head to Manasquan with an extension planned to the Shrewsbury River. As part of this, he wanted to extend Ocean Boulevard from Atlantic Highlands to Keyport via Keansburg and Port Monmouth. Ackerson asked that the state take over maintenance of Ocean Boulevard and continue it west to Keyport, reaching the Keyport–Red Bank Turnpike, which the state had interest in turning into a state thoroughfare. The Senate Appropriation Committee held a hearing on February 7, where several senators and high ranking officials in the state offered their support for the new road. This included Benjamin Morris of Long Branch, Commissioner George Pittenger of Asbury Park and a representative of the Waterway League of New Jersey. Pittenger stated that the construction of Ocean Boulevard would help bring new motorists to resorts on the Shore in Monmouth County. Ackerson announced on March 7 that the Senate passed his Ocean Boulevard bill. The bill included $5,000 for the surveying and mapping of the extension from Atlantic Highlands to Keyport, passing 15–0. $75,000 from the general fund and $75,000 from the state&#x27;s motor vehicle funds. Construction of the extension would begin in 1916 and be finished by 1926.

Surveying for the extension of Ocean Boulevard occurred in June 1916, with the new road along Bay Avenue through several Monmouth County municipalities between Atlantic Highlands and Keyport along Raritan Bay.

Progress stalled until 1918, when Ackerson proposed a new bill in January, amending a $15 million act (Good Roads Bill) to give money for a state highway system. Ackerson&#x27;s new bill would designate the Ocean Boulevard extension between Keyport and Atlantic Highlands as Route 16. By February, there was local concern about the Route 16 amendment passing through the State Legislature.

Ackerson tried again in January 1919, proposing a bill to amend the March 1917 &quot;An Act to Establish a State Highway System and to Provide for the Improvement, Betterment, Reconstruction, Resurfacing, Maintenance, Repair and Regulation of the Use Thereof&quot; to add Route 16 to the state highway system. This new road would begin on Route 4 in the area of Keyport to Atlantic Highlands, down Ocean Avenue in Sea Bright to Norwood Avenue in Allenhurst. The Monmouth County Board of Freeholders endorsed the paving of the proposed-Route 16 at a meeting on February 10, 1919. In their endorsement, the organization stated that Ocean Avenue and Lake Avenue in the city of Asbury Park would be offered to the State Highway Department for improvement for the new Route 16 by 1921. Local concern voiced at the meeting expressed concern that the State Highway Commission would not accept Route 16 or provide any connections to it. One commissioner stated that the same occurred with Route 4 and that there was hope they would consider changing their minds on Route 16.

The League of Mayors endorsed the new Route 16, but noted that people in Asbury Park wanted the route to go through their municipality and that of Ocean Grove. League Assemblyman Dallas Young added that Route 16 would add to the the state wanted to add to the system in Monmouth County. T. Lloyd Lewis stated that he would address the request of those in Asbury Park with Ackerson. However, on March 4, Ackerson withdrew his bill for Route 16, stating that he was not confident he had the votes for the bill to pass. Ackerson re-offered the bill once more on March 18, but the bill failed by a vote of 11–5. The opposition&#x27;s spokesperson, Senator Clarence E. Case, stated that Monmouth County was already given preference in their decision making of the current highway map.

Senator William A. Stevens, Ackerson&#x27;s replacement, brought back a bill to construct the Ocean Boulevard stretch between Atlantic Highlands and Keyport in January 1925. Unlike the bill from Ackerson in 1919, Stevens&#x27; vote passed the Senate unanimously to build the road. Stevens stated that the congestion in Keyport was one of the worst centers in the state and the new route would provide a detour to reduce congestion in Monmouth County.

=== Route 36 ===
Route 36 was established by the Laws of 1927, Chapter 319 to run between Keyport and Highlands. The route was to run up Broad Street from Front Street in Keyport, follow 1st Street east to the 2nd Street Bridge, and run east along Stone Road to Keansburg. It would pass through Keansburg on Church Street and follow Shore Road east to the Belford drawbridge and then on through more rural fields and meadows. Route 36 would head along Center Avenue from Ocean View to Atlantic Highlands, where it would turn north on First Avenue and run east along Ocean Boulevard to Route 36 in Highlands. Route 36 would follow east to the drawbridge over the Shrewsbury River. This routing as proposed was considered impractical as it consisted entirely of local roads, went through the downtown areas of Keyport, Keansburg and Atlantic Highlands, and contained many hazardous sharp curves. This was remedied in 1929, when Route 36 was designated to bypass the downtowns and sharp curves.

In 1940, Route 36 was extended south to Route 35 in Eatontown, but only a portion was constructed in Eatontown and West Long Branch. As a result, this extension remained unsigned in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. Additional parts of this extension were taken over on October 17, 1972, with the takeover of County Route 9, which was Ocean Avenue between the Long Branch–Monmouth Beach border and the Sea Bright–Middletown border, and County Route 44, which was Joline Avenue between Branchport Avenue and Ocean Avenue in Long Branch. CR 9 was initially taken over as a county highway by resolution of the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders on September 1, 1903, running from Rumson Road north to the Middletown border at Sandy Hook. It was extended to the southern border of Monmouth Beach by two resolutions dated February 4, 1920. CR 44 was taken over as a county road on October 18, 1939. Following the takeover of CR 9 and CR 44, a short gap of Route 36 remained in Long Branch (Ocean Avenue between Joline Avenue and the Monmouth Beach border) that was municipally maintained; with the completion of Ocean Boulevard in late 1983 that link has been added.

Between 2008 and 2011, the Highlands–Sea Bright Bridge, which was originally a drawbridge, was replaced with a fixed span with a clearance higher than its predecessor.

==In popular culture==
The Marina Diner from the 1997 film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, now known as the King Arms II Diner, is located along Route 36 in Belford. Additionally, the Quick Stop Groceries and RST Video stores from the 1994 film &quot;Clerks&quot; are located just north of the highway&#x27;s intersection with Leonard Avenue in Leonardo. Both films were created by former New Jersey resident Kevin Smith.

<text>Porto (), also known as Oporto, is the second largest city in Portugal, after Lisbon. It is the capital of the Porto District and one of the Iberian Peninsula&#x27;s major urban areas. Porto city proper, which is the entire municipality of Porto, is small compared to its metropolitan area, with an estimated population of just 248,769 people in a municipality with only . Porto&#x27;s metropolitan area has around 1.8 million people in an area of , making it the second-largest urban area in Portugal. It is recognized as a global city with a Gamma + rating from the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

Located along the Douro River estuary in northern Portugal, Porto is one of the oldest European centers and its core was proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996, as the &quot;Historic Centre of Porto, Luiz I Bridge and Monastery of Serra do Pilar&quot;. The historic area is also a National Monument of Portugal. The western part of its urban area extends to the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean. Its settlement dates back to the 2nd century BC when it was an outpost of the Roman Empire. Its combined Celtic-Latin name, Portus Cale, has been referred to as the origin of the name &quot;Portugal&quot;, based on transliteration and oral evolution from Latin.

Port wine, one of Portugal&#x27;s most famous exports, is named after Porto, since the metropolitan area, and in particular the cellars of Vila Nova de Gaia, were responsible for the packaging, transport, and export of fortified wine. Porto is on the Portuguese Way path of the Camino de Santiago. In 2014 and 2017, Porto was elected &quot;The Best European Destination&quot; by the Best European Destinations Agency. 

==History==
===Early history===
Before the Roman conquest, the Gallaeci, a Celtic people, inhabited the area. Ruins of that period have been discovered in several areas. Archaeological findings reveal that there were also human settlements at the mouth of the Douro River as early as the 8th century BC, which hints at a Phoenician trading settlement there. 

Under the Roman Empire, Porto developed as an important commercial port, primarily in the trade between &quot;Olissipona&quot; (the modern Lisbon) and &quot;Bracara Augusta&quot; (the modern Braga). Porto was also important during the Suebian and Visigothic times, and a center for the expansion of Christianity during that period.
Porto fell under Muslim rule between 714 to 716, following the Umayyad conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom. Porto was reconquered by the Christians under Alfonso I of Asturias in 741, and thus Porto became a Christian border settlement. Vímara Peres, a Galician count from Gallaecia, and a vassal of the King of Asturias, Léon and Galicia, Alfonso III, was given the fief of Portucale, and the surrounding areas. This included the area from the Minho to the Douro River: the settlement of &quot;Portus Cale&quot; and the area that is known as Vila Nova de Gaia. Portus Cale, later referred to as Portucale, was the origin for the modern name of Portugal. In 868, Count Vímara Peres established the County of Portugal, , usually known as &quot;Condado Portucalense&quot;, after repopulating the region north of the Douro River.

In 1093, Teresa of León, illegitimate daughter of the king Alfonso VI of Castile, married Henry of Burgundy, bringing the County of Portugal as a dowry. This &quot;Condado Portucalense&quot; became the focus of what has been called the Portuguese Reconquista that would expand the Kingdom of Portugal south, beginning in the reign of King Afonso I of Portugal in the 12th century.

In 1387, Porto was the site of the marriage of John I of Portugal and Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt; this symbolized a long-standing military alliance between Portugal and England. The Portuguese-English alliance (see the Treaty of Windsor) is the world&#x27;s oldest recorded military alliance. 

In the 14th and 15th centuries, Porto&#x27;s shipyards contributed to the development of Portuguese shipbuilding. Also from the port of Porto, in 1415, Prince Henry the Navigator (son of John I of Portugal) embarked on the conquest of the Moorish port of Ceuta, in northern Morocco. This expedition by the king and his fleet, which included Prince Henry, was followed by navigation and exploration along the western coast of Africa, initiating the Portuguese Age of Discovery. The nickname that the people of Porto are known by began in those days; Portuenses are to this day, colloquially, referred to as &quot;tripeiros&quot; (&quot;tripe peoples&quot;), referring to this period of history, when higher-quality cuts of meat were shipped from Porto with their sailors, while off-cuts and by-products, such as tripe, were left behind for the citizens of Porto; tripe remains a culturally important dish in modern-day Porto.

===18th century===
By the 13th century, the wine produced in the Douro valley was already being transported to Porto in &quot;barcos rabelos&quot; (flat sailing vessels). In 1703, the Methuen Treaty established trade relations and a military alliance between Portugal and England. In 1717, the first English trading post was established in Porto. The production of port wine then gradually passed into the hands of a few English firms. To counter this dominance, Prime Minister Marquis of Pombal established a monopolistic Portuguese firm to receive all the wines from the Douro valley. He demarcated the region for the production of port, to ensure the wine&#x27;s quality; this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe, which was almost a century ahead of a similar exercise in Bordeaux. The small winegrowers revolted against his strict policies on Shrove Tuesday, burning down the buildings of this firm. The revolt became known as the &quot;Revolta dos Borrachos&quot; (revolt of the drunkards).

Between 1732 and 1763, Italian architect Nicolau Nasoni designed a baroque church with a tower that became its architectural and visual icon: the Torre dos Clérigos (English: Clerics&#x27; Tower). During the 18th and 19th centuries, the city became an important industrial center and its size and population increased.

===19th century===

Porto built its first permanent bridge in 1806, the &quot;Ponte das Barcas&quot; (a pontoon bridge). In 1809, the Napoleonic troops in Portugal under Marshal Soult, brought the Peninsular War to the city of Porto. On 29th March, as the population, along with thousands of fugitives from the advancing French troops tried to cross the river Douro over the &quot;Ponte das Barcas&quot;, but the bridge collapsed under the weight causing thousands of deaths. (This event is still remembered by a plate at the Ponte D. Luis I.) The French Army was rooted out of Porto by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, when his Anglo-Portuguese Army crossed the Douro River from the Mosteiro da Serra do Pilar (a former convent) in a brilliant daylight &quot;coup de main&quot;, using wine barges to transport the troops, outflanking the French Army.

Influenced by liberal revolutions occurring in Europe, the Liberal Revolution of 1820 started in Porto. The revolutionaries demanded the return of John VI of Portugal, who had transferred the Portuguese Court to the Portuguese colony of Brazil since the French invasions of Portugal, it also demanded a constitutional monarchy to be set up in Portugal. In 1822, a liberal constitution was accepted, partly through the efforts of the liberal assembly of Porto (Junta do Porto). When Miguel I of Portugal took the Portuguese throne in 1828, he rejected this constitution and reigned as an anti-liberal, absolutist monarch. A civil war (known as the Liberal Wars) was then fought from 1828 to 1834 between those supporting Constitutionalism, and those opposed to this change, keen on near-absolutism and led by D. Miguel. Porto rebelled again and had to undergo a siege of eighteen months between 1832 and 1833 by the absolutist army. Porto is also called &quot;Cidade Invicta&quot; (English: Unvanquished City) after successfully resisting the Miguelist siege. After the abdication of King Miguel, the liberal constitution was re-established.

The collapsed &quot;Ponte das Barcas&quot; was eventually replaced by the Ponte D. Maria II. Known popularly as &quot;Ponte Pênsil&quot; (suspended bridge), it was built between 1841 and 1843, with only its supporting pylons remaining today. The &quot;Ponte D. Maria&quot;, a railway bridge, was inaugurated on 4 November of 1877; it was considered a feat of wrought iron engineering and was designed by Gustave Eiffel, notable for his Parisian tower. The later Ponte Dom Luís I replaced the aforementioned Ponte Pênsil. This last bridge was made by Theophile Seyrig, a former partner of Eiffel. Seyrig won a governmental competition that took place in 1879. Building began in 1881 and the bridge was opened to the public on 31 October 1886.

A higher-learning institution in nautical sciences (Aula de Náutica) was established in 1762. A stock exchange (Bolsa do Porto, 1834 – 1910) was also established in the city but was discontinued in 1910 following the implementation of the Republic, with the building being returned to the Association in 1911.

Unrest by Republicans led to the 31 January 1891 revolt in Porto, the first uprising against the Portuguese monarchy. This resulted ultimately in the overthrow of the monarchy and proclamation of the republic by the 5 October 1910 revolution.

===20th century to present===
On 19 January 1919, forces favorable to the restoration of the monarchy launched a counter-revolution in Porto known as Monarchy of the North. During this time, Porto was the capital of the restored kingdom, as the movement was contained to the north. The monarchy was deposed less than a month later, which marked the final end to monarchy in Portugal.

The historic center of Porto was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996. The World Heritage Site is defined in two concentric zones; the &quot;Protected area&quot;, and within it the &quot;Classified area&quot;. The Classified area comprises the medieval borough located inside the 14th-century Romanesque wall. In 2001, Porto, alongside Rotterdam, was the European Capital of Culture for the entire year. For this event, several urban projects, from urban requalification to new infrastructures and public transportation, were put into practice.

==Geography==

Situated at 280Km from Lisbon, in 1996, UNESCO recognized Porto&#x27;s historic centre as a World Heritage Site. Among the architectural highlights of the city, Porto Cathedral is the oldest surviving structure, together with the small romanesque Church of Cedofeita, the gothic Igreja de São Francisco (Church of Saint Francis), the remnants of the city walls and a few 15th-century houses. The baroque style is well represented in the city in the elaborate gilt work interior decoration of the churches of St. Francis (&quot;São Francisco&quot;) and St. Claire (&quot;Santa Clara&quot;), the churches of Mercy (&quot;Misericórdia&quot;) and of the Clerics (&quot;Clérigos&quot;), the Episcopal Palace of Porto, and others. The neoclassicism and romanticism of the 19th and 20th centuries also added interesting monuments to the landscape of the city, like the magnificent Stock Exchange Palace (&quot;Palácio da Bolsa&quot;), the Hospital of Saint Anthony, the Municipality, the buildings in the Liberdade Square and the &quot;Avenida dos Aliados&quot;, the tile-adorned São Bento railway station and the gardens of the Crystal Palace (&quot;Palácio de Cristal&quot;). A guided visit to the Palácio da Bolsa, and in particular, the Arab Room is a major tourist attraction.

Many of the city&#x27;s oldest houses are at risk of collapsing. The population in Porto municipality dropped by nearly 100,000 since the 1980s, but the number of permanent residents in the outskirts and satellite towns has grown strongly.
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 7 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
*Aldoar, Foz do Douro e Nevogilde
*Bonfim
*Campanhã
*Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, São Nicolau e Vitória
*Lordelo do Ouro e Massarelos
*Paranhos
*Ramalde

===Climate===

Porto features a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;), with influences of an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), common in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. As a result, its climate shares many characteristics with the warm, dry Mediterranean climates of southern Europe and the wet marine west coast climates of the North Atlantic, providing it warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy days can, occasionally, interrupt the sunny weather. These occasional summer rainy periods may last a few days and are characterized by showers and cool temperatures around in the afternoon. The annual precipitation is high and concentrated in the winter months, making Porto one of the wettest major cities of Europe. However, long periods with higher temperatures and sunny days are frequent even during the rainiest months.

Summers are typically sunny, with average temperatures between , but can rise to as high as during occasional heat waves. During such heatwaves, the humidity remains quite low. Nearby beaches are often windy and usually cooler than the urban areas. Summer average temperatures are a few degrees cooler than those expected in more continentally Mediterranean-influenced Portuguese cities because of the oceanic influence.

Winter temperatures typically range between early in the morning and in the afternoon, but rarely drop below at night. The weather is often rainy for long stretches, although prolonged sunny periods do occur.


==Politics and government==

Rui Moreira (Independent) is the current mayor of Porto, having taken office on 22 October 2013, following the 2013 local elections. He was reelected in 2017 and 2021.

===Local election results 1976–2021===
===Active political parties established in Porto===
The Portuguese party &quot;Iniciativa Liberal&quot; (IL), founded and headquartered in Porto, is the only Portuguese party represented in parliament which is headquartered outside of the Lisbon area.

== Demographics ==

Breaking down the population further shows that there is a higher percentage of women than men. Estimates from 2016 show that the population is 55% female, compared to 45% male. The largest age group, according to 2016 estimates, is 60 to 69, followed by residents in the 50 to 59 demographic. The majority 93.7% of residents were born in Portugal. The city also has residents that were born in Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, and countries across Europe. 

===Census results===
==Economy==
Porto plus the conurbation to which it belongs and has Porto municipality as its central core forming the nucleus of the conurbation, is a major industrial and financial center of both Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula. As the most important city in the heavily industrialized northwest, many of the largest Portuguese corporations from diverse economic sectors, like Altri, Ambar, Amorim, Bial, BPI, Cerealis, CIN, Cofina, EFACEC, Frulact, Lactogal, Millennium bcp, Porto Editora, RAR, Sonae, Sonae Indústria, and Super Bock Group, are headquartered in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Porto, most notably, in the core municipalities of Maia, Matosinhos, Porto, and Vila Nova de Gaia.

The city&#x27;s former stock exchange (Bolsa do Porto) was transformed into the largest derivatives exchange of Portugal, and merged with Lisbon Stock Exchange to create the Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto, which eventually merged with Euronext, together with Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris stock and futures exchanges. The building formerly hosting the stock exchange is currently one of the city&#x27;s touristic attractions, with the Salão Árabe (Arab Room in English) being its major highlight. The Banco Português de Fomento (BPF), a Portuguese state-owned development bank established in 2020, is headquartered in Porto.

Porto hosts a popular Portuguese newspaper, &quot;Jornal de Notícias&quot;. The building where its offices are located (which has the same name as the newspaper) was at a time one of the tallest in the city (it has been superseded by a number of modern buildings which have been built since the 1990s).

Porto Editora, one of the biggest Portuguese publishers, is also located in Porto. Its dictionaries are among the most popular references used in the country, and the translations are very popular as well.

The economic relations between the city of Porto and the Upper Douro River have been documented since the Middle Ages. However, they were greatly deepened in the modern age. Indeed, sumach, dry fruits and nuts and the Douro olive oils sustained prosperous exchanges between the region and Porto. From the riverside quays at the river mouth, these products were exported to other markets of the Old and New World. However, the greatest lever to interregional trade relations resulted from the commercial dynamics of the Port wine (&quot;Vinho do Porto&quot;) agro-industry. It decidedly bolstered the complementary relationship between the large coastal urban centre, endowed with open doors to the sea, and a region with significant agricultural potential, especially in terms of the production of extremely high quality fortified wines, known by the world-famous label &quot;Port&quot;. The development of Porto was also closely connected with the left margin of River Douro in Vila Nova de Gaia, where is located the amphitheater-shaped slope with the Port wine cellars.
The city is very much the gateway to Portugal&#x27;s northern region as well as the northern and western areas of Spain. Within a two-hour drive of Porto&#x27;s airport, there are four Unesco World Heritage sites and popular Spanish tourist hotspots such as Santiago de Compostela.
In a study concerning competitiveness of the 18 Portuguese district capitals, Porto was the worst-ranked. The study was made by Minho University economics researchers and was published in Público newspaper on 30 September 2006. The best-ranked cities in the study were Évora, Lisbon, and Coimbra. Nevertheless, the validity of this study was questioned by some Porto notable figures (such as local politicians and businesspersons) who argued that the city proper does not function independently but in conurbation with other municipalities. A 2007 ranking published in &quot;Expresso&quot; ranked Porto as the third best city to live in Portugal – tied with Évora and below Guimarães and Lisbon. 

The Porto metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to €43.1 billion ($46.6 billion) and €24,075 ($25,989) per capita in 2023.

===Tourism===

Over the last few years, Porto has experienced significant tourism increases, which may be partly linked to the Ryanair hub at Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport. Porto won the European Best Destination 2012, 2014 and 2017 awards.

The city received 2.8 million overnight visitors and 1.4 million day trippers between January and November 2017, with 73% from other countries. Tourism revenue has been increasing by over 11%, according to a 2018 report.

According to a February 2019 report, over 10% of economic activity in Porto is generated by tourism. The hotel occupancy rate in 2017 was 77%. A scholarly study published in June 2019 stated that &quot;Porto is one of the fastest-growing European tourist destinations that has experienced
exponential growth in the demand for city-break tourists&quot;.

The most popular tourist attractions in the city include the Porto Cathedral, Dom Luís I Bridge, Café Majestic, Livraria Lello and Jardins do Palácio de Cristal.

==Transport==
===Roads and bridges===
The road system capacity is augmented by the &quot;Via de Cintura Interna&quot; or A20, an internal highway connected to several motorways and city exits, complementing the &quot;Circunvalação&quot; 4-lane peripheric road, which borders the north of the city and connects the eastern side of the city to the Atlantic shore. The city is connected to Valença (Viana do Castelo) by highway A28, to Estarreja (Aveiro) by the A29, to Lisbon by the A1, to Bragança by the A4 and to Braga by the A3. There is also an outer-ring road, the A41, that connects all the main cities around Porto, linking the city to other major metropolitan highways such as the A7, A11, A42, A43 and A44. Since 2011, a new highway, the A32, connects the metropolitan area to São João da Madeira and Oliveira de Azeméis.

The Dom Luís I Bridge (Ponte de Dom Luís I) is a double-deck metal arch bridge that spans the River Douro between Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia. Built in 1886, its 172 metres (564 ft) span was then the longest of its type in the world. The top-level is used for the Porto Metro trains, with an option for pedestrians; the lower level carries traffic and pedestrians.

During the 20th century, major bridges were built: &quot;Arrábida Bridge&quot;, which at its opening had the biggest concrete supporting arch in the world, and connects the north and south shores of the Douro on the west side of the city, &quot;S. João&quot;, to replace &quot;D. Maria Pia&quot; and &quot;Freixo&quot;, a highway bridge on the east side of the city. The newest bridge is Infante Dom Henrique Bridge, finished in 2003. Two more bridges are said to be under designing stages and due to be built in the next 10 years, one on the Campo Alegre area, nearby the Faculty of Humanities and the Arts, and another one in the area known as the Massarelos valley. 

Porto is often referred to as &quot;Cidade das Pontes&quot; (City of the Bridges), besides its more traditional nicknames of &quot;Cidade Invicta&quot; (Unconquered/ Invincible City) and &quot;Capital do Norte&quot; (Capital of the North).

=== Cruising ===
In July 2015 a new cruise terminal was opened at the port of Leixões, which is north of the city in Matosinhos.

===Airport===
Porto is served by Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport which is located in Pedras Rubras, Moreira da Maia civil parish of the neighbouring Municipality of Maia, some to the north-west of the city centre. The airport underwent a massive programme of refurbishment due to the Euro 2004 football championships being partly hosted in the city. It is connected to central Porto by metro’s line E. By 2024, the airport served nearly 16 million passengers, being the 2nd busiest airport in Portugal and the 37th busiest in Europe.

===Public transport===
====Railways====
Porto&#x27;s main railway station is Campanhã railway station, located in the eastern part of the city and connected to the lines of Douro (Peso da Régua/Tua/Pocinho), Minho (Barcelos/Viana do Castelo/Valença) and centre of Portugal (on the main line to Aveiro, Coimbra and Lisbon).

From Campanhã station, both light rail and suburban rail services connect to the city center. The main central station is São Bento Station, which is itself a notable landmark in the heart of Porto. This station was built between 1900 and 1916, based on plans by architect José Marques da Silva. The large panels of azulejo tile were designed by Jorge Colaço; the murals represent moments in the country&#x27;s history and rural scenes showing the people of various regions.

Porto is connected with Lisbon via high-speed trains, &quot;Alfa Pendular&quot;, that cover the distance in 2h 42min. The intercities take slightly more than 3 hours to cover the same distance. In addition, Porto is connected to the Spanish city of Vigo with the Celta train, running twice every day, a 2h 20min trip.

====Light rail====

Currently, the major network is the Porto Metro, a light rail system. Consequently, the Infante bridge was built for urban traffic, replacing the Dom Luís I, which was dedicated to the light rail on the second and higher of the bridge&#x27;s two levels. Six lines are open: lines A (blue), B (red), C (green) and E (purple) all begin at Estádio do Dragão (home to FC Porto) and terminate at Senhor de Matosinhos, Póvoa de Varzim (via Vila do Conde), ISMAI (via Maia) and Francisco Sá Carneiro airport respectively. Line D (yellow) currently runs from Hospital S. João in the north to Vila d&#x27;Este on the southern side of the Douro river. Line F (orange), from Senhora da Hora (Matosinhos) to Fânzeres (Gondomar). The lines intersect at the central Trindade station. Currently, the whole network spans using 85 stations, thus being the biggest urban rail transit system in the country.

In 2019, Porto Metro transferred the management of the Funicular dos Guindais to Porto city hall. Currently, expansion of the network is underway, with two lines under construction and a bus rapid transit expected to open during 2025.

====Buses====
The city has an extensive bus network run by the STCP (Sociedade dos Transportes Colectivos do Porto, or Oporto Public transport Society) which also operates lines in the neighbouring cities of Gaia, Maia, Matosinhos, Gondomar and Valongo. Other smaller companies connect such towns as Paços de Ferreira and Santo Tirso to the town center. In the past, the city also had trolleybuses. A bus journey is 2.50 €, which must be paid in cash.

====Trams====

A tram network, of which only three lines remain one of them being a tourist line on the shores of the Douro, saw its construction begin on 12 September 1895, therefore being the first in the Iberian Peninsula. The lines in operation all use vintage tramcars, so the service has become a heritage tramway. STCP also operates these routes as well as a tram museum. The first line of the area&#x27;s modern-tram, or light rail system, named &quot;Metro do Porto&quot;, opened for revenue service in January 2003 (after a brief period of free, introductory service in December 2002).

====Porto public transportation statistics====
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Porto, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 47 minutes. About 6.5% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 minutes, while 17.4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people ride in a single trip with public transit is 6 km, while 5% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

==Culture==

In 2001, Porto shared the designation European Culture Capital with Rotterdam. In the scope of these events, the construction of the major concert hall space Casa da Música, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, was initiated and finished in 2005.

The first Portuguese moving pictures were taken in Porto by Aurélio da Paz dos Reis and shown there on 12 November 1896 in the Teatro do Príncipe Real do Porto, less than a year after the first public presentation by Auguste and Louis Lumière. The country&#x27;s first movie studios Invicta Filmes was also erected in Porto in 1917 and was open from 1918 to 1927 in the area of Carvalhido. Manoel de Oliveira, a Portuguese film director and the oldest director in the world to be active until his death in 2015, was from Porto.

===Arts===
Porto was the birthplace in 1856 of Susanna Roope Dockery, an Anglo-Portuguese watercolour painter who produced many paintings of the city and the people and landscape of the surrounding rural areas. An Englishman, Frederick William Flower, moved to Oporto in 1834 at the age of 19 to work in the wine trade and subsequently became a pioneer of photography in Portugal. Like Dockery, he drew his inspiration from the city, the Douro river and the rural areas.

In 2005, the municipality funded a public sculpture to be built in the Waterfront Plaza of Matosinhos. The resulting sculpture is entitled &quot;She Changes&quot; by American artist, Janet Echelman, and spans the height of 50 × 150 × 150 metres.

===Football===

As in most Portuguese cities, football is the most popular sport. There are two main teams in Porto: FC Porto in the parish of Campanhã in the eastern part of the city, and Boavista in the area of Boavista in the parish of Ramalde, in the western part of the city, close to the city centre. FC Porto is one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; teams in the main Portuguese football league, and was European champion in 1987 and 2004, won the UEFA Cup (2003) and Europa League (2011) and the Intercontinental Toyota Cup in 1987 and 2004. Boavista have won the championship once, in the 2000–01 season and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup in 2003, where they lost 2–1 to Celtic.

Formerly, Salgueiros from Paranhos was a regular first division club during the 1980s and 1990s but, due to financial indebtedness, the club folded in the 2000s. The club was refounded in 2008 and began playing at the regional level. They now play at the third level of Portugal&#x27;s national football pyramid.

The biggest stadiums in the city are FC Porto&#x27;s Estádio do Dragão and Boavista&#x27;s Estádio do Bessa. The first team in Oporto to own a stadium was Académico, who played in the &quot;Estádio do Lima&quot;, Académico was one of the eight teams to dispute the first division. Salgueiros, sold the grounds of Estádio Engenheiro Vidal Pinheiro field to the Oporto Metro and planned on building a new field in the &quot;Arca d&#x27;Água&quot; area of Porto. Located a few hundred metres away from the old grounds, it became impossible to build on this plot of land due to a large underground water pocket, and, consequently, they moved to the Estádio do Mar (owned by Leixões S.C.) in the neighboring Matosinhos municipality. For the Euro 2004 football competition, held in Portugal, the Estádio do Dragão was built (replacing the old Estádio das Antas) and the Estádio do Bessa was renovated.

<text>Route 37 is a state highway located in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States. The route runs from a traffic circle with Route 70 in Lakehurst east to an interchange with Route 35 in Seaside Heights. A two– to six–lane divided highway its entire length, Route 37 serves as the major east–west route through the Toms River area as well as a main route to the Barnegat Peninsula, crossing the Barnegat Bay on the Thomas A. Mathis and J. Stanley Tunney Bridges. The route through Toms River is lined with many businesses and named Little League World Champions Boulevard in honor of Toms River East Little League&#x27;s victory in the 1998 Little League World Series. Route 37 intersects many major roads in the Toms River area, including CR 527, the Garden State Parkway/US 9, Route 166, CR 549, and CR 571. The route experiences congestion from both development in the area and from traffic bound for the barrier islands in the summer.

Route 37 was first legislated in 1927 in two sections: one running from Trenton to White Horse along the current US 206 alignment that replaced part of Pre-1927 Route 2 and the other running from Lakehurst to Point Pleasant that replaced part of Pre-1927 Route 18 between Lakehurst and Toms River. In 1953, Route 37 was legislated along its current alignment, with the designation dropped on the Trenton–White Horse segment to avoid the concurrency with US 206 and the Seaside Heights–Point Pleasant section becoming a realignment of Route 35. Route 37 was then proposed in the 1960s as a freeway running from White Horse to Seaside Heights. This freeway proposal was eventually altered to create I-195, running from Trenton to Wall Township.

==Route description==

Route 37 begins at the Lakehurst Circle with Route 70 in Lakehurst, heading east first briefly as an undivided two-lane road, then becoming a four–lane divided highway. Soon after beginning, the route crosses into Manchester. It intersects with Commonwealth Boulevard, which provides access to the Leisure Village West-Pine Lake Park community, before crossing into Toms River. Route 37 continues east with many intersections that feature jughandles and at the intersection with Industrial Way, the road widens to six lanes. Route 37 passes to the north of Holiday City - Silver Ridge Park, an age-restricted community which contributes to the large population of senior residents in the area. The route crosses Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Toms River Industrial Track line before it meets the intersection with Mule Road (CR 642) and Oak Ridge Parkway/Lakehurst Road (CR 527). After the intersection with Oak Ridge Parkway/Lakehurst Road (CR 527), the route passes north of Community Medical Center and crosses over the North Branch of the Toms River.

Route 37 features a cloverleaf interchange with the Garden State Parkway/US 9. Past the Garden State Parkway, the route crosses the former alignment of US 9, Route 166. Past this intersection, Route 37 becomes a road lined with several businesses. The route intersects with Hooper Avenue (CR 549) and Clifton Avenue (CR 38). Vaughn Avenue/West End Avenue (CR 627) intersects next and Route 37 runs along the border between Toms River to the north and Island Heights to the south. Route 37 meets the intersection of Central Avenue (CR 627) and fully enters Toms River again at the intersection with Gilford Avenue. Further east, the route intersects with Fischer Boulevard (CR 549 Spur/CR 571).

Route 37 crosses the Barnegat Bay on the Tunney Mathis Bridge with the eastbound bridge featuring a drawbridge that allows ships to pass through while the westbound bridge is a higher-level span. The route continues onto Pelican Island in the Barnegat Bay, crossing into a small piece of Berkeley Township. Route 37 crosses over a part of the Barnegat Bay and heads onto the Barnegat Peninsula, where the route comes to its eastern terminus at an interchange with Route 35 on the border of Berkeley Township and Seaside Heights. At this interchange, access to Seaside Heights is provided by a ramp from northbound Route 35 a short distance past the ramp from eastbound Route 37, connecting to Sumner Avenue, while access from Seaside Heights to westbound Route 37 is provided by a direct ramp from Hamilton Avenue.

Due to the area&#x27;s vacationers, many of which come from New York and Northern New Jersey, Route 37 is routinely congested with seasonal traffic in the summer, especially on and around the Mathis and Tunney Bridges and at the interchange with the Garden State Parkway as heavy tourist traffic converges on the shore. Additionally, the road sees congestion due to the area&#x27;s rapid growth in commercial development.

==History==

The road from Toms River to Seaside Heights was part of the Jersey Coast Way, which stretched from Cape May to the Staten Island Ferry. Prior to 1927, the route between present-day Route 70 in Lakehurst and present-day CR 527 in Toms River was a part of Pre-1927 Route 18, which was legislated in 1923 to run from Camden to Toms River. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 37 was legislated to run from Route 27 and Route 30 (now Business US 1, US 206, and Route 31) in Trenton to Route 35 (now Route 88) in Point Pleasant, passing through White Horse, Allentown, Lakehurst, Toms River, and Seaside Heights. The portion between Trenton and White Horse replaced part of Pre-1927 Route 2, while the portion between Lakehurst and Toms River replaced part of Pre-1927 Route 18.
Following the 1927 renumbering, Route 37 existed in multiple separate sections: one running from the Trenton–Hamilton line to the White Horse Circle (concurrently with US 206), the crossing of Gropp Lake in Hamilton (currently a state-maintained section of CR 524), a segment between Hamilton and Upper Freehold west of Allentown (also current CR 524), a section of current CR 539 between Burlington Path Road in Upper Freehold and Hornerstown Road in Plumsted Township, and one running from Route 40 (now Route 70) in Lakehurst to Point Pleasant. The remainder of the route between White Horse and Lakehurst remained incomplete. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 37 was legislated to run along its current alignment from Route 70 in Lakehurst to Route 35 in Seaside Heights. The number was dropped between Trenton and White Horse in favor of US 206, while the section between Seaside Heights and Point Pleasant became a realignment of Route 35.
Route 37 was proposed in the late 1960s as a freeway that was to run from Route 29 in the Trenton area to Seaside Heights. It was suggested that this freeway be completed by 1975 in order to handle a rapid growth of population in Central New Jersey. In 1967, this proposal was altered to build a road that compromised with the proposed Route 38 freeway between Camden and Wall Township. It soon received federal funding and was built as I-195, running from Trenton to Wall Township.

The portion of Route 37 within Toms River was officially named Little League World Champions Boulevard in 1998 following Toms River East Little League&#x27;s victory in the 1998 Little League World Series.

<text>Quebec City is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. As of July 2021, the city had a population of 549,459, and the Census Metropolitan Area (including surrounding communities) had a population of 839,311. It is the twelfth-largest city and the seventh-largest metropolitan area in Canada. It is also the second-largest city in the province, after Montreal. It has a humid continental climate with warm summers coupled with cold and snowy winters.

Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement here in 1608, and adopted the Algonquin name. Quebec City is one of the oldest European settlements in North America. The ramparts surrounding Old Quebec () are the only fortified city walls remaining in the Americas north of Mexico. This area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 as the &quot;Historic District of Old Québec&quot;.

==Name and usage==

Common English-language usage distinguishes the city from the province by referring to the former as Quebec City.

According to the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, and the Geographical Names Board of Canada, the names of Canadian cities and towns have only one official form. Thus, Québec is officially spelled with an accented é in both Canadian English and French. However, province names can have different forms in English and French. As a result, in English, the federal government style distinguishes the city and province by spelling the city with an acute accent (Québec) and the province without one (Quebec). The government of Quebec spells both names &quot;Québec&quot;, including when writing in English.

In French, the two are distinguished in that province names including Quebec generally take definite articles, while city names do not. As a result, the city is and the province is ; &quot;in Quebec City&quot; is and &quot;in the province of Quebec&quot; is ; and so forth.

The Algonquian people had originally named the area , an Algonquin word meaning &quot;where the river narrows&quot;, because the Saint Lawrence River narrows by the promontory of Quebec and its Cape Diamant.

==History==
=== French regime (1500s–1763) ===
Quebec City is one of the oldest European settlements in North America and the only fortified city north of Mexico whose walls still exist. While many of the major cities in Latin America date from the 16th century, among cities in Canada and the United States, few were created earlier than Quebec City (St. John&#x27;s, Harbour Grace, Port Royal, St. Augustine, Santa Fe, Jamestown, and Tadoussac).
It is home to the earliest known French settlement in North America, Fort Charlesbourg-Royal, established in 1541 by explorer Jacques Cartier with some 400 persons but abandoned less than a year later due to the harsh winter and resistance of indigenous inhabitants to colonial incursion on their land. The fort was at the mouth of the Rivière du Cap Rouge, in the suburban former town of Cap-Rouge (which merged into Quebec City in 2002).

Quebec was founded by Samuel de Champlain, a French explorer and diplomat, on 3 July 1608, and at the site of a long abandoned St. Lawrence Iroquoian settlement called Stadacona. Champlain, who came to be called &quot;The Father of New France&quot;, served as its administrator for the rest of his life.

The name &quot;Canada&quot; was given to the colony that developed around the settlement at Quebec. Although the Acadian settlement at Port-Royal was established three years earlier, Quebec came to be known as the cradle of North America&#x27;s Francophone population. The location seemed favourable to the establishment of a permanent colony.

The population of the settlement remained small for decades. In 1629 it was captured by English privateers, led by David Kirke, during the Anglo-French War. Samuel de Champlain argued that the English seizing of French lands was illegal as the war had already ended, and worked to have them returned to France. As part of the ongoing negotiations following the end of the Anglo-French War, in 1632 the English king Charles I agreed to return captured lands in exchange for Louis XIII paying his wife&#x27;s dowry. These terms were signed into law with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The colonies of Canada and Acadia were returned to the French Company of One Hundred Associates.

In 1665, there were 550 people in 70 houses living in the city. One-quarter of the people were members of religious orders: secular priests, Jesuits, Ursulines nuns and the order running the local hospital, Hôtel-Dieu.

Quebec was the headquarters of many raids against New England during the French and Indian Wars. In 1690 the city was attacked by the English, but was successfully defended. In the last of the conflicts, the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War), Quebec was captured by the British in 1759, and held until the end of the war in 1763. In that time many battles and sieges took place: the Battle of Beauport, a French victory (31 July 1759); the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, in which British troops under General James Wolfe defeated the French General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm on 13 September 1759, and shortly thereafter took the city after a short siege. A French counterattack saw a French victory at the Battle of Sainte-Foy (28 April 1760) but the subsequent second Siege of Quebec the following month however saw a final British victory.

France ceded New France, including the city, to Britain in 1763, when the French and Indian War officially ended.

At the end of French rule, Quebec was a town of 8,000 inhabitants, surrounded by forests, villages, fields and pastures. The town was distinguished by its monumental architecture, fortifications, and affluent homes of masonry and shacks in the suburbs of Saint-Jean and Saint-Roch. Despite its urbanity and its status as capital, Quebec remained a small city with close ties to its rural surroundings. Nearby inhabitants traded their farm surpluses and firewood for imported goods from France at the two city markets.

=== British and Canadian rule (1763–present)===

During the American Revolution, revolutionary troops from the southern colonies assaulted the British garrison in the city in the hope that the peoples of Quebec would rise and join the American Revolution so that Canada would join the Continental Congress, along with the other British colonies of continental North America. The American invasion failed, however, and the war resulted in a permanent split of British North America into two entitles: the newly independent United States of America, and those colonies (including Quebec) that remained under British control, which would later become the country of Canada.

The city itself was not attacked during the War of 1812, when the United States again attempted to annex Canadian lands. Amid fears of another American attack on Quebec City, construction of the Citadelle of Quebec began in 1820. The Americans did not attack Canada after the War of 1812, but the Citadelle continued to house a large British garrison until 1871. It is still in use by the military and is also a tourist attraction.

Until the late 18th century Québec was the most populous city in present-day Canada. As of the census of 1790, Montreal surpassed it with 18,000 inhabitants, but Quebec, which had about 14,000 of population at that time, remained the administrative capital of the former New France. It was then made the capital of Lower Canada by the Constitutional Act of 1791. From 1841 to 1867, the capital of the Province of Canada rotated between Kingston, Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa and Quebec City (from 1851 to 1855 and from 1859 to 1865).
The city experienced an economic golden age in the 1800s, due to its favorable location on the Saint Lawrence River which gave rise to industries of wooden sailing ships manufacture, export of squared timber logs. to Europe, as well as associated enterprises such as sawmills. However, by the 1870s, Québec City entered a period of economic decline. Contributing factors included the rise of steel-hulled steamships, the expansion of railroads at the expense of waterways for continental commerce; the depletion of forest resources near major rivers upstream of Québec City and in the west of the province, which were transported to Québec&#x27;s port by log driving; the construction of locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway, opening up trade routes to the U.S. from Montreal; and the city&#x27;s inability to retain immigrant populations. This unfavourable context, coupled with the departure of the British army from the city&#x27;s Citadel in 1871, contributed to the exodus of English speaking populations, such as local bourgeoisie of Scottish origin or workers of Irish background, to Montreal in the second half of the 19th century. Anglophones made up approximately 40% of the city&#x27;s population in 1861, but 16% in 1901.

Before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, the only French-speaking officer training school was the Quebec City School of Military Instruction, founded in 1864. The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, The School of Artillery was formed in Montreal.

The Quebec Conference on Canadian Confederation was held in the city in 1864. In 1867, Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the definite capital of the Dominion of Canada, while Quebec City was confirmed as the capital of the newly created province of Quebec.

During World War II, two conferences were held in Quebec City. The First Quebec Conference was held in 1943 with Franklin D. Roosevelt (President of the United States), Winston Churchill (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom), William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada) and T. V. Soong (minister of foreign affairs of China). The Second Quebec Conference was held in 1944 and was attended by Churchill and Roosevelt. They took place in the buildings of the Citadelle and at the nearby Château Frontenac. A large part of the D-Day landing plans were made during those meetings.

Until 2002, Quebec was a mostly urbanized city and its territory coterminous with today&#x27;s borough of La Cité-Limoilou. The Government of Quebec then mandated a municipal reorganization in the province, and many suburbs of the north shore of the Saint-Lawrence were merged into Quebec City, taking the form of boroughs, thus constituting the boundary of present-day Québec City. In 2008 the city celebrated its 400th anniversary and was gifted funds for festivities and construction projects by provincial and federal governments, as well as public artwork by various entities, including foreign countries.

==Geography==
Quebec City was built on the north bank of the Saint Lawrence River, where it narrows and meets the mouth of the Saint-Charles River. Old Quebec is located on top and at the foot of Cap-Diamant, which is on the eastern edge of a plateau called the promontory of Quebec (Quebec hill). Because of this topographic feature, the oldest and most urbanized borough of La Cité-Limoilou can be divided into upper and lower town. North of the hill, the Saint Lawrence Lowlands is flat and has rich, arable soil. Past this valley, the Laurentian Mountains lie to the north of the city but its foothills are within the municipal limits.

The Plains of Abraham are located on the southeastern extremity of the plateau, where high stone walls were integrated during colonial days. On the northern foot of the promontory, the lower town neighbourhoods of Saint-Roch and Saint-Sauveur, traditionally working class, are separated from uptown&#x27;s Saint-Jean-Baptiste and by a woody area attested as .

The area was affected by the 1925 Charlevoix–Kamouraska earthquake.

The administrative region in which it is situated is officially referred to as Capitale-Nationale, and the term &quot;national capital&quot; is used to refer to Quebec City itself at the provincial level.

===Climate===

Quebec City is classified as a hemiboreal humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcbc&quot;).

Quebec City experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm and occasionally hot, with periods of hotter temperatures which compounded with the high humidity, create a high heat index that belies the average high of and lows of . Winters are cold, windy and snowy with average high temperatures and lows . Spring and fall, although short, bring chilly to warm temperatures. Late heat waves as well as &quot;Indian summers&quot; are a common occurrence.

On average, Quebec City receives of precipitation, of which is rain and is the melt from of snowfall per annum. The city experiences around 1,916 hours of bright sunshine annually or 41.5% of possible sunshine, with summer being the sunniest, but also slightly the wettest season. During winter, snow generally stays on the ground from the end of November till mid-April.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Quebec City was on 17 July 1953. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 10 January 1890 and 14 January 2015.

===Boroughs and neighbourhoods===

On 1 January 2002, the 12 former towns of Sainte-Foy, Beauport, Charlesbourg, Sillery, Loretteville, Val-Bélair, Cap-Rouge, Saint-Émile, Vanier, L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette, Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures and Lac-Saint-Charles were annexed by Quebec City. This was one of several municipal mergers which took place across Quebec on that date. Following a demerger referendum, L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette and Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures were reconstituted as separate municipalities on 1 January 2006, but the other former municipalities remain part of Quebec City. On 1 November 2009, Quebec City re-organized its boroughs, reducing the number from 8 to 6.

Quebec City&#x27;s six boroughs () are further divided into 35 neighbourhoods (). In most cases, the name of the latter remained the same as the historical town () or parish municipality it replaced. Neighbourhoods each elect their own council, whose powers rest in public consultations.

Compared to many other cities in North America, there is less variation between average household incomes between the neighbourhoods. However, some disparities exist. The southwest former cities of Sillery, Cap-Rouge and Sainte-Foy are considered to be the wealthiest, along with some parts of Montcalm and Old Quebec.

The city&#x27;s traditional working-class areas are found in the lower town below Old Quebec (Saint-Sauveur and Saint-Roch) and directly across the Saint-Charles River to the north (Vanier and Limoilou). However, parts of Limoilou, Saint-Sauveur and particularly Saint-Roch have seen gentrification in the last 20 years, attracting young professionals and the construction of new offices and condos.

Northern sections (Loretteville, Val-Bélair) and eastern sections (Beauport, Charlesbourg) are mostly a mix of middle-class residential suburbs with industrial pockets.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Québec had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to Statistics Canada, there were 839,311 people residing in the Quebec City census metropolitan area.

In 2016, 20.6% of the resident population in Quebec City was of retirement age (65 and over for males and females) compared with 16.9% in Canada. The median age is 43.3 years of age compared to 41.2 years of age for Canada as a whole. In the five years between 2011 and 2016, the population of Quebec City grew by 3%.

=== Ethnicity ===
In 2021, 9.4% of Quebec City residents reported visible minority status, a relatively low figure for a large Canadian city; the national average was 26.5%. The largest visible minority group were Black Canadians, who formed 4.1% of the population. Quebec City also had a lower percentage of Indigenous Canadians (1.8%) than the national average of 5.0%.

=== Immigration ===
The 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 45,230 persons or 8.5% of the total population of Quebec City. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were France (7,360 persons or 16.3%), Colombia (2,865 persons or 6.3%), Morocco (2,715 persons or 6.0%), Ivory Coast (2,500 persons or 5.5%), Cameroon (2,225 persons or 4.9%), Algeria (1,920 persons or 4.2%), Tunisia (1,795 persons or 4.0%), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1,315 persons or 1,315%), Haiti (1,120 persons or 2.5%), and Brazil (1,115 persons or 2.5%).

=== Language ===
The great majority of city residents are native French speakers. The English-speaking community peaked in relative terms during the 1860s, when 40% of Quebec City&#x27;s residents were Anglophone. Today, native Anglophones make up only about 1.5% of the population of both the city and its metropolitan area. However, the summer tourist season and the Quebec Winter Carnival attract significant numbers of Anglophone (as well as Francophone) visitors, and English can often be heard in areas frequented by tourists.

In 2021, according to Statistics Canada, 90.6% of Quebec City&#x27;s population spoke French as their sole mother tongue. More than a third of city residents reported being capable of speaking both French and English.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Quebec City included:
*Christianity (349,320 residents, or 65.5%)
*Irreligion (162,900; 30.5%)
*Islam (17,490; 3.3%)
*Buddhism (1,565; 0.3%)
*Hinduism (515; 0.1%)
*Judaism (305; 0.1%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (75; &lt;0.1%)
*Sikhism (20; &lt;0.1%)
*Other (1,355; 0.3%)

==Economy==
Most jobs in Quebec City are concentrated in public administration, defence, services, commerce, transport and tourism. As the provincial capital, the city benefits from being a regional administrative and services centre: apropos, the provincial government is the largest employer in the city, employing 27,900 people as of 2007. CHUQ (the local hospital network) is the city&#x27;s largest institutional employer, with more than 10,000 employees in 2007. The unemployment rate in June 2018 was 3.8%, below the national average (6.0%) and the second-lowest of Canada&#x27;s 34 largest cities, behind Peterborough (2.7%).

Around 10% of jobs are in manufacturing. Principal products include pulp and paper, processed food, metal/wood items, chemicals, electronics and electrical equipment, and printed materials. The city hosts the headquarters of a variety of prominent companies, including: fashion retailer La Maison Simons, engineering firms BPR and Norda Stelo; Cominar real estate investment trust; Beneva, Industrial Alliance, Promutuel, and Union Canadienne in the insurance sector; Beenox, Gearbox Software, Frima Studio, Sarbakan and Ubisoft in the computer games industry; AeternaZentaris and DiagnoCure in pharmaceuticals; Amalgame, Cossette and Vision 7 in marketing and advertising; Institut National d&#x27;Optique (INO), EXFO, OptoSecurity in technology. It is also the domicile of the sole manufactory of the cigarette maker Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges.

=== Business districts ===
While the traditional central business districts and their large office buildings are found on Parliament Hill (especially for provincial administration) and just below in Saint-Roch (nowadays notable for IT and the video game industry), a newer one has emerged in the area of Sainte-Foy, where a number of accounting and law firms have moved since the 2000s. Other suburban places identified by the city for their potential are the Lebourgneuf area for private offices, as well as Estimauville Street where the Government of Canada already has many civil servants and where several city officials are expected to move in the 2020s.

==Arts and culture==


Quebec City is known for its Winter Carnival, its summer music festival and its Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day celebrations.
The Jardin zoologique du Québec, now closed, reopened in 2002 after extensive repairs before ultimately shutting permanently in 2006. It featured 750 specimens of 300 different species of animals. The zoo specialized in winged fauna and garden themes but also featured several species of mammals. While it emphasized Quebec&#x27;s indigenous fauna, one of its main attractions was the Indo-Australian greenhouse, which initially cost $14 million to build. It featured fauna and flora from regions surrounding the Indian Ocean.

Parc Aquarium du Québec, which reopened in 2002 on a site overlooking the Saint Lawrence River, features more than 10,000 specimens of mammals, reptiles, fish and other aquatic fauna of North America and the Arctic. Polar bears and various species of seals of the Arctic sector and the &quot;Large Ocean&quot;, a large basin offering visitors a view from underneath, make up part of the aquarium&#x27;s main attractions.

Québec City has a number of historic sites, art galleries and museums, including Citadelle of Quebec, Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, Ursulines of Quebec, and Musée de la civilisation.

Other tourist attractions include Montmorency Falls, and, just outside the city limits, the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, the Mont-Sainte-Anne ski resort, and the Ice Hotel.

==Attractions==
Given the mass of Cap Diamant and the presence of la Citadelle atop it, overlooking the waters of the St. Lawrence River, Charles Dickens described Quebec City as the &quot;Gibraltar of North America&quot;.

===Architecture===

Much of the city&#x27;s notable traditional architecture is located in Vieux-Québec (Old Quebec), within and below the fortifications. This area has a distinct European feel with its stone buildings and winding streets lined with shops and restaurants. Porte Saint-Louis and Porte Saint-Jean are the main gates through the walls from the modern section of downtown; the Kent Gate was a gift to the province from Queen Victoria and the foundation stone was laid by the Queen&#x27;s daughter, Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne, on 11 June 1879. West of the walls are the Parliament Hill area, and to the south the Plains of Abraham.

The upper and lower town are linked by numerous stairs such as the &quot;Escalier « casse-cou »&quot; (&quot;breakneck stairway&quot;) or the Old Quebec Funicular on the historic Rue du Petit-Champlain, where many small boutiques are found. A small town square nearby, the Place Royale, now surrounded by picturesque stone buildings, is the site of Champlain&#x27;s founding of the city in 1608. On it is the Notre-Dame-des-Victoires church. The Musée de la Civilisation is located nearby by the river.


Along with concrete high-rises such as Édifice Marie-Guyart and Le Concorde on parliament hill (see List of tallest buildings in Quebec City), the city&#x27;s skyline is dominated by the massive Château Frontenac hotel, perched on top of Cap-Diamant. It was designed by architect Bruce Price, as one of a series of &quot;château&quot; style hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The railway company sought to encourage luxury tourism and bring wealthy travellers to its trains.
Alongside the Château Frontenac is the Terrasse Dufferin, a walkway along the edge of the cliff, offering views of the Saint Lawrence River. The terrace leads toward the nearby Plains of Abraham, site of the battle in which the British took Quebec from France, and the Citadelle of Quebec, a Canadian Forces installation and the federal vice-regal secondary residence. The Parliament Building, the meeting place of the Parliament of Quebec, is also near the Citadelle.

Near the Château Frontenac is Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral, mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec. It is the first church in the New World to be raised to a basilica and is the primatial church of Canada. There are 37 National Historic Sites of Canada in Quebec City and its enclaves.

===Parks===
One of the most notable is The Battlefields Park, which is home to 50 historical artillery pieces and the Plains of Abraham. The park offers views of the St. Lawrence River and has multiple historical structures and statues like the &quot;Joan of Arc on Horseback&quot; and a couple of Martello Towers. Historically this was the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), a decisive British victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War which ended French rule in what would become Canada, and the later Battle of Quebec (1775) during the American Revolutionary War, where the British were able to hold onto its last stronghold in the Northern extent of its North American territory.

Other large and centrally located parks are Parc Victoria, Parc Maizerets and Cartier-Brébeuf National Historic Site.
Quebec City&#x27;s largest park is the , which is crossed by the suburban section of the city-wide Saint-Charles River and is thus also part of the long Saint-Charles River&#x27;s linear park. At Chauveau, activities such as canoeing, fishing and cross-country skiing are offered depending on the season, in addition to an interior soccer stadium. Among others, there is also the beach of Beauport Bay, as well as the Marais du Nord (north-end marsh land).

Quebec is the only large city in Canada along with Halifax lacking a public greenhouse. Nonetheless, outside areas known for their public gardens or landscaping include:
* The linear park named that stretches alongside the Saint Lawrence River, from Pierre Laporte Bridge to Sillery&#x27;s east-end. Its bicycle and pedestrian paths then continues to Old Quebec and then along the Saint-Charles River. Just like the beach at Beauport Bay, the construction of the &quot;Promenade&quot; was funded by provincial and federal governments to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Quebec City in 2008.
* Government House (Quebec), slightly west of the Plains of Abraham in Sillery, and known for its natural landscaping as well as traditional gardens, such as those surrounding the historical . The historical significance of the park also lies in the former presence of the viceregal Government House of Quebec (1845–1966).
* The Domaine de Maizerets, where are found an arboretum and an observation tower, not far from the Saint Lawrence River and Beauport Bay.
* in Sillery.
* The of .

==Sports==
Quebec City has hosted a number of recent sporting events, as well as being shortlisted for the 2002 Winter Olympics city selection. The Special Olympics Canada National Winter Games was held in the city from 26 February to 1 March 2008. Quebec City co-hosted with Halifax, Nova Scotia, the 2008 IIHF World Championship. Regular sporting events held in the city include the Coupe Banque Nationale, a Women&#x27;s Tennis Association tournament; Crashed Ice, an extreme downhill skating race; Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament, a minor hockey tournament; and the Tour de Québec International cycling stage race. In December 2011, Quebec City hosted the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final at the Pavillon de la Jeunesse at ExpoCité.

The city currently has one professional team, the baseball team Capitales de Québec, which plays in the Frontier League in downtown&#x27;s Stade Canac. The team was established in 1999 and originally played in the Northern League. It has nine league titles, won in 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2022 and 2023. A professional basketball team, the Quebec Kebs, played in National Basketball League of Canada in 2011 but folded before the 2012 season, and a semi-professional soccer team, the Dynamo de Québec, played in the Première ligue de soccer du Québec, until 2019.

The city had a professional ice hockey team, the Quebec Nordiques, which played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1979 and the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 to 1995, maintaining a strong rivalry with the Montreal Canadiens. Due to a disadvantageous exchange rate with respect to the US dollar, the team moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1995, becoming the Colorado Avalanche. A lower-tier team, the Quebec Rafales, played in the professional International Hockey League from 1996 to 1998.

The Videotron Centre was built with the hope of getting an NHL franchise (relocation or expansion) in Quebec City. The project was funded regardless of whether an NHL team arrives. It is also hoped that the arena can help Quebec City win a future Winter Olympics games bid. It has now replaced the Colisée de Québec as the main multifunctional arena in Quebec City.

Other teams include the Quebec Remparts in major junior hockey (QMJHL), Université Laval varsity team Rouge &amp; Or, the Quebec City Monarks, and Quebec City Rebelles of La Ligue de Football de Québec; the Alouettes de Charlesbourg of the Ligue de Baseball Junior Élite du Québec; the women&#x27;s hockey team Quebec Phoenix of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Hockey League; and soccer club Quebec Arsenal of the W-League.

Quebec City holds the Coop FIS Cross-Country World Cup. This is a ski event that welcomes the best of that sport.

==Government==
Since the 1960s, centre-right parties such as Union Nationale, Crédit social, Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), Action démocratique du Québec and Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) have been more popular in the Quebec City region than elsewhere in the province. After the federal election of 2006, six of the ten conservative ridings of the province were found in its metropolitan area (where the CPC garnered 39% of the vote, against 25% at the provincial scale) and in the city proper, the CPC won three of the four seats that existed at that time (the riding of Quebec went to the Bloc). Along with the city&#x27;s lesser support for Quebec sovereignty, this led political pundits to speculate about a &quot;Quebec City mystery&quot;.

Various lines of thought were offered, including the popularity of the talk radio stations CHOI and FM93 expressing fiscally conservative and non-politically correct opinions. Over the years, this genre has been qualified by its detractors as () and hosts like Jeff Fillion and André Arthur likened to shock jocks. Also, compared to the rest of the province, people of the area may favour harsher criminal sentences, and lower-class households may share political views more in line with those earning more. The reasons for this remain unclear. Another researcher put forward the historical factors that led to Montreal surpassing Quebec as the metropolis of British North America in the early 19th century. According to this theory, its permanent status of &quot;second city&quot; (albeit the capital) engendered feelings of &quot;repressed jealousy&quot;.

The &quot;mystery&quot; was relativized following the 2011 federal election. All five ridings within the city were won by the leftist New Democratic Party, in the so-called &quot;orange wave&quot; that temporarily swept the province. Nonetheless, five of the six seats won by the Conservatives in the province were found in the greater Quebec City area. At the 2018 provincial election, the leftist party Québec solidaire managed to win two districts, Taschereau and Jean-Lesage, the most densely populated in town, but the centre-right CAQ, as it swept the province, won six of the nine districts encompassing the city, and 15 of the 18 in the administrative regions of Capitale-Nationale and Chaudière-Appalaches (south shore of the city).



===Municipal government===
Quebec City is governed by a mayor–council government, which includes the 21 single-member districts of the legislative Quebec City Council and the separately elected mayor. The councilors are elected by first-past-the-post voting while the mayor is elected by the city at-large. Both usually belong to political parties and are elected at the same time every 4 years. The mayor is an ex officio member of the council but is not its president and has no vote. The current one is Bruno Marchand, elected in 2021.

Each of the city&#x27;s six boroughs has a council composed of 3 to 5 of the aforementioned councillors, depending on the size of its population. It has jurisdiction with matters such as local road maintenance, leisure, waste collection, and small grants for community projects and others, but cannot tax or borrow money. The boroughs are further divided into 35 neighbourhoods, which also have councils devoted to public consultations, each led by 11 citizens. Their geographical limits may be distinct from those of the city&#x27;s 21 electoral districts, and councillors also sit at their neighbourhood councils as non-voting ex officio members.

====Public safety====
The city is protected by Service de police de la Ville de Québec and Service de protection contre les incendies de Québec (fire dept.) The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Quebec City has one of the lowest crime rates in Canada, with 3,193 per 100,000 persons in 2017, only behind Toronto&#x27;s CMA (3,115). Exceptionally, no homicide (defined as a criminal death, deliberate or not) was reported in 2007. Still, eight homicides occurred the following year.

On 29 January 2017, a university student shot and killed six people with another 17 injured in a mass shooting at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre. Even after accounting for this event, the CMA of Quebec had the second lowest Crime Severity Index in the country in 2017, at 48.5, after that of Barrie (45.3). For the year 2017, the number of reported incidents investigated as hate crimes by the city police increased from 57 to 71, and for those specifically targeting Muslims from 21 to 42. The overall rate of reported hate crimes was thus 7.1 per 100,000 population — higher than the national average (3.9) and in Montreal (4.7) but lower than rates in Hamilton, Ottawa and Thunder Bay.

There were two first-degree murders in 2018, seven in 2017 (six of which were due to the mosque shooting), one in 2016, two in 2015 and three in 2014.

On 1 November 2020, the Quebec City police arrested a man dressed in medieval costume and armed with a Japanese sword. Carl Girouard, the arrestee, reportedly killed 2 people and hospitalized 5 others.

==Infrastructure==
===Roads===
Two bridges (the Quebec Bridge and Pierre Laporte Bridge) and a ferry service connect the city with Lévis and its suburbs along the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. The Orleans Island Bridge links Quebec City with pastoral Orleans Island.

Quebec City is an important hub in the province&#x27;s autoroute system, as well as boasting one of the highest &quot;expressway lane kilometres per 1000 persons&quot; in the country (1.10 km), behind Calgary (1.74), Hamilton (1.61) and Edmonton (1.24). Autoroute 40 connects the region with Montreal and Ottawa to the west and Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré and the Charlevoix region to the east. Autoroute 20 parallels the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, linking Quebec City with Montreal and Toronto to the west and Rivière-du-Loup, Rimouski, and the Maritime Provinces to the east. Autoroute 73 provides a north–south link through the metropolitan area, linking it with Saint-Georges, the Beauce region, and Maine to the south and Saguenay and the Lac-Saint-Jean region to the north.

Within the metropolitan region, Autoroutes 40, 73, and several spur routes link the city centre with its suburbs.

Autoroute 573 (Autoroute Henri-IV) connects the city with CFB Valcartier. Autoroute 740 (Autoroute Robert-Bourassa) serves as a north–south inner belt. Autoroute 440 comprises two separate autoroutes to the west and east of the urban core. Originally meant to be connected by a tunnel under the city centre, the two sections are separated by a gap. There are no current plans to connect them. The western section (Autoroute Charest) connects Autoroutes 40 and 73 with Boulevard Charest (a main east–west avenue) while the eastern section (Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency) links the city centre with Beauport and Montmorency Falls.
===Public transport===

The Réseau de transport de la Capitale (RTC) is responsible for public transport in the region. The RTC operates a fleet of buses and has recently implemented articulated buses. The RTC is studying the return of a tramway system to help ease overcrowding on its busiest lines as well as attract new users to public transit. The two billion dollar revitalization project needs approval from higher levels of government since the city does not have the financial resources to fund such an ambitious project on its own. As of 2022, the project named Quebec City Tramway is under development.

Rail transport is operated by Via Rail at the Gare du Palais (&#x27;Palace Station&#x27;). The station is the eastern terminus of the railway&#x27;s main Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. An inter-city bus station, with connections to the provincial long-distance bus network, is adjacent to the train station, and is used by operators such as Orleans Express and Intercar.

===Air and sea===
Quebec City is served by Jean Lesage International Airport, located west of the city centre.

The Port of Quebec is a seaport on the St. Lawrence with facilities in the first, fifth and sixth boroughs.

==Education==
The (Laval University) is in the southwestern part of the city, in the borough of Sainte-Foy, except for its school of architecture, which is at the &quot;Vieux-Séminaire&quot; building in Old Quebec.

The Université du Québec system administrative headquarters and some of its specialized schools (, Institut national de la recherche scientifique and Télé-université) are in the Saint-Roch neighbourhood.

CEGEPs of Quebec city are Collège François-Xavier-Garneau, Cégep Limoilou, Cégep de Sainte-Foy and Champlain College St. Lawrence, as well as private and specialized post-secondary institutions such as Campus Notre-Dame-de-Foy, Collège Mérici, Collège Bart, Collège CDI, Collège O&#x27;Sullivan and Collège Multihexa.

Three school boards, including Commission scolaire de la Capitale, operate secular francophone schools, and Central Quebec School Board operates the few existing anglophone ones. Until 1998 Commission des écoles catholiques de Québec operated public Catholic schools of all languages.

Quebec City has the oldest educational institution for women in North America, led by the Ursulines of Quebec, which is now a private elementary school.

==Sister cities==
Quebec City is twinned with:
* Bordeaux, France
* Calgary, Alberta.

It has formal agreements with other cities although they are not active as of 2012. These include Saint Petersburg in Russia, Guanajuato City in Mexico, Huế in Vietnam, Paris, Xi&#x27;an in China, and Liège and Namur in francophone Belgium.

<text>Regina ( ) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city is the second-largest in the province, and is a commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan. As of the 2021 census, Regina had a city population of 226,404, and a metropolitan area population of 249,217. It is governed by Regina City Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159.

Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories, of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part, and of the District of Assiniboia. The site was previously called Wascana (from &quot;Buffalo Bones&quot;), but was renamed to &quot;Regina&quot; (Latin for &quot;Queen&quot;) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria. The name was proposed by Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughter Princess Louise, who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada, the Marquess of Lorne.

Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West, on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off, Wascana Creek. Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake. Regina&#x27;s importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906. Wascana Centre, created around the focal point of Wascana Lake, remains one of Regina&#x27;s attractions and contains the Provincial Legislative Building, both campuses of the University of Regina, First Nations University of Canada, the Royal Saskatchewan Museum, the Regina Conservatory (in the original Regina College buildings), the Saskatchewan Science Centre, the MacKenzie Art Gallery and the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts.

Residential neighbourhoods include precincts beyond the historic city centre are historically or socially noteworthy neighbourhoods – namely Lakeview and The Crescents, both of which lie directly south of downtown. Immediately to the north of the central business district is the old warehouse district, increasingly the focus of shopping, nightclubs and residential development; as in other western cities of North America, the periphery contains shopping malls and big box stores.

In 1912, the Regina Cyclone destroyed much of the town; in the 1930s, the Regina Riot brought further attention and, in the midst of the 1930s drought and Great Depression, which hit the Canadian Prairies particularly hard with their economic focus on dry land grain farming. The CCF (now the NDP, a major left-wing political party in Canada), formulated its foundational Regina Manifesto of 1933 in Regina. In 2007 Saskatchewan&#x27;s agricultural and mineral resources came into new demand, and Saskatchewan was described as entering a new period of strong economic growth.

==History==

===Early history (1882–1945)===
Regina was established as the territorial seat of government in 1882 when Edgar Dewdney, the lieutenant-governor of the North-West Territories, insisted on the site over the better developed Battleford, Troy and Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle (the latter some to the east, one on rolling plains and the other in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley between two lakes). These communities were considered better locations for what was anticipated to be a metropole for the Canadian plains. These locations had ample access to water and resided on treed rolling parklands. &quot;Pile-of-Bones&quot;, as the site for Regina was then called (or, in Cree, &quot;Oskana kâ-asastêki&quot;), was by contrast located in arid and featureless grassland.

Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney had acquired land adjacent to the route of the future CPR line at Pile-of-Bones, which was distinguished only by collections of bison bones near a small spring run-off creek, some few kilometres downstream from its origin in the midst of what are now wheat fields. There was an &quot;obvious conflict of interest&quot; in Dewdney&#x27;s choosing the site of Pile-of-Bones as the territorial seat of government and it was a national scandal at the time. But until 1897, when responsible government was accomplished in the Territories, the lieutenant-governor and council governed by fiat and there was little legitimate means of challenging such decisions outside the federal capital of Ottawa. There, the Territories were remote and of little concern. Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, wife of the then Governor General of Canada, named the new community &quot;Regina&quot;, in honour of her mother, Queen Victoria.

Commercial considerations prevailed and the town&#x27;s authentic development soon began as a collection of wooden shanties and tent shacks clustered around the site designated by the CPR for its future station, some to the east of where Dewdney had reserved substantial landholdings for himself and where he sited the Territorial (now the Saskatchewan) Government House.

Regina attained national prominence in 1885 during the North-West Rebellion when troops were mostly able to be transported by train on the CPR from eastern Canada as far as Qu&#x27;Appelle Station, before marching to the battlefield in the further Northwest – Qu&#x27;Appelle having been the major debarkation and distribution centre until 1890 when the completion of the Qu’Appelle, Long Lake, and Saskatchewan Railway linked Regina with Saskatoon and Prince Albert. Subsequently, the rebellion&#x27;s leader, Louis Riel, was tried and hanged in Regina – giving the infant community increased and, at the time, not unwelcome national attention in connection with a figure who was generally at the time considered an unalloyed villain in anglophone Canada. The episode, including Riel&#x27;s imprisonment, trial and execution, brought the new Regina &quot;Leader&quot; (later the &quot;Leader-Post&quot;) to national prominence.

Regina was incorporated as a city on 19 June 1903, with the MLA who introduced the charter bill, James Hawkes, declaring, &quot;Regina has the brightest future before it of any place in the North West Territories&quot;. Several years later the city was proclaimed the capital of the 1905 province of Saskatchewan on 23 May 1906, by the first provincial government, led by Premier Walter Scott; the monumental Saskatchewan Legislative Building was built between 1908 and 1912.

The &quot;Regina Cyclone&quot; was a tornado that devastated the city on 30 June 1912 and remains the deadliest tornado in Canadian history, with a total of 28 fatalities, the population of the city having been 30,213 in 1911. Green funnel clouds formed and touched down south of the city, tearing a swath through the residential area between Wascana Lake and Victoria Avenue, continuing through the downtown business district, rail yards, warehouse district, and northern residential area.

From 1920 to 1926 Regina used Single transferable vote (STV), a form of proportional representation, to elect its councillors. Councillors were elected in one at-large district. Each voter cast just a single vote, using a ranked transferable ballot.

Regina grew rapidly until the beginning of the Great Depression, in 1929, though only to a small fraction of the originally anticipated population explosion as population centre of the new province. By this time, Saskatchewan was considered the third province of Canada in both population and economic indicators. Thereafter, Saskatchewan never recovered its early promise and Regina&#x27;s growth slowed and at times reversed.

In 1933, Regina hosted the first national convention Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (predecessor of the NDP). At the convention, the CCF adopted a programme known as the Regina Manifesto, which set out the new party&#x27;s goals. In 1935, Regina gained notoriety for the Regina Riot, an incident of the On-to-Ottawa Trek. (See The Depression, the CCF and the Regina Riot.) Beginning in the 1930s, Regina became known as a centre of considerable political activism and experimentation as its people sought to adjust to new, reduced economic realities, including the co-operative movement and medicare.

===Modern history (1945–present)===

The disappearance of the Simpson&#x27;s, Eaton&#x27;s and Army &amp; Navy retail department stores in or near the central business district and Simpsons-Sears to the north on Broad Street, left only the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company as a large department store in Regina-centre. This, with the proliferation of shopping malls beginning in the 1960s and &quot;big box stores&quot; in the 1990s on the periphery, together with a corresponding drift of entertainment venues (and all but one downtown cinema) to the city outskirts, had depleted the city centre. The former Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company department store (previously the site of the Regina Theatre though long vacant after that burned to the ground) has been converted into offices; Globe Theatre, located in the old Post Office building at 11th Avenue and Scarth Street, Casino Regina and its show lounge in the former CPR train station, the Cornwall Centre and downtown restaurants now draw people downtown again.

Many buildings of significance and value were lost during the period from 1945 through approximately 1970: Knox United Church was demolished in 1951; the Romanesque Revival city hall in 1964 (the failed shopping mall which replaced it is now office space for the Government of Canada) and the 1894 Supreme Court of the North-West Territories building at Hamilton Street and Victoria Avenue in 1965. 

In 1962 Wascana Centre Authority was established to govern the sprawling 50-year-old, urban park and legislative grounds. A 100-year plan was developed by World Trade Centre Architect Minoru Yamasaki and landscape architect Thomas Church, as part of developing a new University of Saskatchewan campus in the southeast end of the park. The master plan has been subsequently revised every five to seven years since, most recently in 2016. Wascana Centre has made Regina as enjoyable and fulfilling for residents as it had long been the &quot;metropole&quot; for farmers and residents of small neighbouring towns. Despite the setting, improbable though it always was compared with other more likely sites for the capitol, the efforts&#x27; results were favourable.

The long-imperilled Government House was saved in 1981 after decades of neglect and returned to viceregal use, the former Anglican diocesan property at Broad Street and College Avenue is being redeveloped with strict covenants to maintain the integrity of the diocesan buildings and St Chad&#x27;s School and the former Sacred Heart Academy building immediately adjacent to the Roman Catholic Cathedral has been converted into townhouses.

Recently older buildings have been put to new uses, including the old Normal School on the Regina College campus of the University of Regina (now the Canada Saskatchewan Production Studios) and the old Post Office on the Scarth Street Mall. The Warehouse District, immediately adjacent to the central business district to the north of the CPR line, has become a desirable commercial and residential precinct as historic warehouses have been converted to retail, nightclubs and residential use.

==Geography==

The city is situated on a broad, flat, treeless plain. There is an abundance of parks and greenspaces: all of its trees — some 300,000 — shrubs and other plants were hand-planted. As in other prairie cities, American elms were planted in front yards in residential neighbourhoods and on boulevards along major traffic arteries and are the dominant species in the urban forest.

In recent years the pattern of primary and high school grounds being acreages of prairie sports grounds has been re-thought and such grounds have been landscaped with artificial hills and parks. Newer residential subdivisions in the northwest and southeast have, instead of spring runoff storm sewers, decorative landscaped lagoons.

The streetscape is now endangered by Dutch elm disease, which has spread through North America from the eastern seaboard and has now reached the Canadian prairies; for the time being it is controlled by pest management programs and species not susceptible to the disease are being planted; the disease has the potential to wipe out Regina&#x27;s elm population.
===Climate===

Regina experiences a warm summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), with more than 70% of average annual precipitation in the warmest six months, and is in the NRC Plant Hardiness Zone 3b. Regina has warm summers and cold, dry winters, prone to extremes at all times of the year. Average annual precipitation is and is heaviest from May through August, with June being the wettest month with an average of of precipitation. The average daily temperature for the year is . The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 1 January 1885, while the highest recorded temperature was on 5 July 1937.

==Cityscape==
Some neighbourhoods of note include:
# the remaining residential portion of the original town between the CPR tracks and Wascana Lake
# the downtown business district, deemed &quot;Market Square&quot;;
# the Cathedral Area;
# the historic and affluent Crescents area, immediately to the north of Wascana Creek west of the Albert Street bridge and dam which creates Wascana Lake;
# Germantown, originally a poor and ill-serviced area of continental Europeans;
# Lakeview, adjacent to the provincial Legislative Building and office buildings, a neighbourhood of some imposing mansions dating from before the First World War through the post-War &#x27;20s boom; and
# the Warehouse District, formerly the reception zone for freight, being redeveloped as desirable residential accommodation, restaurants, nightclubs and shopping precincts.

===Bedroom communities===

From its first founding, particularly once motorcars were common, Reginans have retired to the nearby Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley on weekends, for summer and winter holidays and indeed as a place to live permanently and commute from. Since the 1940s, many of the towns near Regina have steadily lost population as western Canada&#x27;s agrarian economy reorganised itself from small family farm landholdings of a quarter-section (, the original standard land grant to homesteaders) to the multi-section (a &quot;section&quot; being ) landholdings that are increasingly necessary for economic viability.

Some of these towns have enjoyed something of a renaissance as a result of the excellent roads that for many decades seemed likely to doom them; they – and to some extent the nearby city of Moose Jaw – are now undergoing a mild resurgence as commuter satellites for Regina. Qu&#x27;Appelle, at one time intended to be the metropole for the original District of Assiniboia in the North-West Territories (as they then were), saw during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s Regina cottagers pass through en route to the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley; Highway 10, which bypassed Qu&#x27;Appelle, running directly from Balgonie to Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle off Highway Number 1, quickly ended this. Qu&#x27;Appelle has recently seen more interest taken in it as a place to live. Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle and its neighbouring resort villages on the Fishing Lakes remain a summer vacation venue of choice; Indian Head is far enough from Regina to have an autonomous identity but close enough that its charm and vitality attract commuters – it &quot;has a range of professional services and tradespeople, financial institutions, and a number of retail establishments.&quot; It was the scene of outdoor filming sequences in the CBC television series &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie.&quot;
White City and Emerald Park are quasi-suburbs of Regina, as have become Balgonie, Pense, Grand Coulee, Pilot Butte and Lumsden in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley, some to the north of Regina. Regina Beach — situated on Last Mountain Lake (known locally as Long Lake) and a 30-minute drive from Regina – has been a summer favourite of Reginans from its first establishment and since the 1970s has also become a commuter satellite; Rouleau (also known as the town of Dog River in the CTV television sitcom &quot;Corner Gas&quot;) is southwest of Regina and in the summer months used to &quot;bustle with film crews.&quot;

==Culture==

Regina has a substantial cultural life in music, theatre and dance, supported by the fine arts constituency at the University of Regina, which has faculties of music, theatre and arts. At various times this has attracted notable artistic talent: the Regina Five were artists at Regina College (the university&#x27;s predecessor) who gained national fame in the 1950s. The long-established MacKenzie Art Gallery once occupied cramped quarters adjacent to Darke Hall on the University of Regina College Avenue Campus; since relocated to a large building at the southwest corner of the provincial government site, at Albert Street near 23rd Avenue. Donald M. Kendrick, Bob Boyer and Joe Fafard, now with significant international reputations, have been other artists from or once in Regina.

The Regina Symphony Orchestra, Canada&#x27;s oldest continuously performing orchestra, performs in the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts (now the Conexus Arts Centre). Concerts and recitals are performed both by local and visiting musicians in the Centre of the Arts and assorted other auditoriums including the University of Regina. The Regina Conservatory of Music operates in the former girls&#x27; residence wing of the Regina College building.

The Regina Little Theatre began in 1926, and performed in Regina College before building its own theatre in 1981. Regina lacked a large concert and live theatre venue for many years after the loss to fire of the Regina Theatre in 1938 and the demolition of the 1906 City Hall in 1964 at a time when preservation of heritage architecture was not yet a fashionable issue. But until the demolition of downtown cinemas which doubled as live theatres the lack was not urgent, and Darke Hall on the Regina College campus of the university provided a small concert and stage venue.

Annual festivals in and near Regina through the year include the Regina International Film Festival; Cathedral Village Arts Festival; the Craven Country Jamboree; the Regina Folk Festival; Queen City Pride; the Queer City Cinema film festival; the Regina Dragon Boat Festival; and Mosaic, mounted by the Regina Multicultural Council, which earned Heritage Canada&#x27;s designation of 2004 &quot;Cultural Capital of Canada&quot; (in the over 125,000 population category). The annual Kiwanis Music Festival affords rising musical talents the opportunity to achieve nationwide recognition. The city&#x27;s summer agricultural exhibition was originally established in 1884 as the Assiniboia Agricultural Association, then from the mid-1960s and up until 2009 as Buffalo Days then from that time until today, the Queen City Ex.

This was remedied in 1970 with the construction of the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts (now the Conexus Arts Centre) as a Canadian Centennial project, a theatre and concert hall complex overlooking Wascana Lake which is one of the most acoustically perfect concert venues in North America; it is home to the Regina Symphony Orchestra (Canada&#x27;s oldest continuously performing orchestra), Opera Saskatchewan and New Dance Horizons, a contemporary dance company. The Royal Saskatchewan Museum (the present 1955 structure a Saskatchewan Golden Jubilee project) dates from 1906. The old Post Office at Scarth Street and 11th Avenue, temporarily used as a city hall after the demolition of the 1906 City Hall, is now home to the Globe Theatre, founded in 1966 as &quot;Saskatchewan&#x27;s first professional theatre since 1927.&quot; Holy Rosary Roman Catholic Cathedral and Knox-Metropolitan United Church have particularly impressive Casavant Frères pipe organs, maintain substantial musical establishments and are frequently the venues for choral concerts and organ recitals.

The Regina Public Library is a citywide library system with nine branches. Its facilities include the RPL Film theatre which plays non-mainstream cinema, the Dunlop Art Gallery, special literacy services and a prairie history collection. The MacKenzie Art Gallery in Wascana Centre and the Dunlop Art Gallery have permanent collections and sponsor travelling exhibitions. The Saskatchewan Archives and the Saskatchewan Genealogical Library also offer information for those interested in the people of Saskatchewan.

===Parks and attractions===
Regina has a substantial proportion of its overall area dedicated as parks and green spaces, with biking paths, cross-country skiing venues, and other recreational facilities throughout the city. Wascana Lake, the venue for summer boating activities, is regularly cleared of snow in winter for skating, and there are toboggan runs both in Wascana Centre and downstream on the banks of Wascana Creek. Victoria Park is in the central business district and numerous green spaces throughout the residential subdivisions and subdivisions in the north and west of the city contain large ornamental ponds to add interest to residential precincts such as Rochdale, Lakewood, Lakeridge, Spruce Meadows, and Windsor Park. Older school playing fields throughout the city have also been converted into landscaped parks.

The city operates five municipal golf courses, including two in King&#x27;s Park northeast of the city. Kings Park Recreation facility is also home to ball diamonds, picnic grounds, and stock car racing. Within half an hour&#x27;s drive are the summer cottage and camping country and winter ski resorts in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley with Last Mountain and Buffalo Pound Lakes and the four Fishing Lakes of Pasqua, Echo, Mission and Katepwa; slightly farther east are Round and Crooked Lakes, also in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley, and to the southeast the Kenosee Lake cottage country.

Wascana Centre is a park built around Wascana Lake and designed in 1961 by Minoru Yamasaki — the Seattle-born architect best known as the designer of the original World Trade Center in New York – in tandem with his starkly modernist design for the new Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan. Wascana Lake was created as a &quot;stock watering hole&quot; — for the CPR&#x27;s rolling stock, that is – in 1883 when a dam and bridge were constructed 1½ blocks to the west of the present Albert Street Bridge. A new dam and bridge were built in 1908, and Wascana Lake was used as a domestic water source, to cool the city&#x27;s power plant and, in due course, for the new provincial legislative building.

By the 1920s, with Boggy Creek as a source of domestic water and wells into the aquifer under Regina, Wascana Lake had ceased to have a utilitarian purpose and had become a primarily recreational facility, with bathing and boating its principal uses. It was drained in the 1930s as part of a government relief project; 2,100 men widened and dredged the lake bed and created two islands using only hand tools and horse-drawn wagons.

During the fall and winter of 2003–2004, Wascana Lake was again drained and dredged to deepen it while adding a new island, a promenade area beside Albert Street Bridge, water fountains, and a waterfall to help aerate the lake.

Downstream from Wascana Lake, Wascana Creek continues to provide a lush parkland on its increasingly intensively developed perimeter; in the northwest quadrant of the city Wascana Creek has a second weir with a smaller reservoir in A.E. Wilson Park.

====Visitor attractions====

Regina is a travel destination for residents of southeastern Saskatchewan and the immediately adjacent regions of the neighbouring US states of North Dakota and Montana, and an intermediate stopping point for travellers on the Trans-Canada Highway. Tourism is promoted by Tourism Regina. Attractions for visitors in Regina include:
* Wascana Centre, a park around Wascana Lake bringing together lands containing government, recreational, cultural, educational and environmental buildings and facilities.
* Victoria Park in downtown Regina offers the Regina Folk Festival and other outdoor festivities including the nearby Farmers Market in the summertime.
* the Royal Saskatchewan Museum (a museum of natural history);
* the Saskatchewan Science Centre, housed in the 1914 Powerhouse on east Wascana Lake;
* the Norman Mackenzie Art Gallery and numerous smaller galleries and museums;
* the Roman Catholic cathedral on 13th Avenue in the West End, but also perhaps to a somewhat lesser extent the Anglican cathedral in downtown Regina and the Romanian Orthodox cathedral on Victoria Avenue in the East End;
* the Hotel Saskatchewan first opened by the CPR has accommodated royalty on numerous occasions and still maintains the ambiance of a bygone time
* Knox-Metropolitan United Church on Victoria Park in downtown Regina: the surviving downtown congregation of the United Church (Metropolitan Methodist and the now demolished or closed Knox, Carmichael and St Andrew&#x27;s United Churches, previously Presbyterian, were its antecedents or now-defunct daughter congregations) with the largest pipe organ in Regina;
* the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) national training centre and the museum;
* Government House, where regular tours are available, conducted by guides in &quot;period&quot; costume and the Lieutenant-Governor holds an annual levée on New Year&#x27;s Day;
* Casino Regina, in the old Union Station;
* the Globe Theatre in the Old Post Office building on the Scarth Street Mall;
* events held at Mosaic Stadium sports stadium and the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts;
* REAL District, formerly Evraz Place (formerly Ipsco Place, previously Regina Exhibition Park), the venue for the annual Queen City Ex (formerly Buffalo Days Exhibition) summer agricultural fair every August; and
* the Canadian Western Agribition, a winter agricultural show and marketplace every November.

The former large-scale Children&#x27;s Day Parade and Travellers&#x27; Day Parade during Fair Week in the summer, which were substantially supported by the Masons and Shriners, has become the fair parade as such service clubs have lost vitality; the Regina Exhibition&#x27;s travelling midway divides its time among other western Canadian and US cities. A Santa Claus parade is now mounted during the lead-up to Christmas.

===Sports===

The Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League play their home games at Mosaic Stadium in Regina. Formed in 1910 as the Regina Rugby Club and renamed the Regina Roughriders in 1924 and the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1946, the &quot;Riders&quot; are a community-owned team with a loyal fan base; out-of-town season ticket holders often travel or more to attend home games. The team has won the Grey Cup on four occasions, in 1966, 1989, 2007, and 2013. Regina is also home to a successful women&#x27;s football team, the Regina Riot of the Western Women&#x27;s Canadian Football League. The Riot have won three league championships, in 2015, 2017, and 2018.

Other sports teams in Regina include the four-time Memorial Cup champion Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League, the Regina Thunder of the Canadian Junior Football League, the Prairie Fire of the Rugby Canada Super League, the Regina Red Sox of the Western Canadian Baseball League, and the University of Regina&#x27;s Regina Cougars/Regina Rams of U Sports. Regina is also where all Water Polo players from Saskatchewan centralize, Regina&#x27;s team being Water Polo Armada.

Regina&#x27;s curling teams have distinguished the city for many decades. Richardson Crescent commemorates the Richardson curling team of the 1950s. In recent years Olympic Gold medal winner Sandra Schmirler and her rink occasioned vast civic pride; the Sandra Schmirler Leisure Centre in east Regina commemorates her. Regina held the 1973, 1983, and 2011 World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship. The city has two curling clubs: The Caledonian and the Highland.

North-east of the city lies Kings Park Speedway, a ⅓-mile paved oval used for stock car racing since the late 1960s. Regina hosted the Western Canada Summer Games in 1975, and again in 1987, as well as being the host city for the 2005 Canada Summer Games. Regina also held the 2014 North American Indigenous Games.

==Economy==

Regina, as the capital of Saskatchewan, is the headquarters of a number of Saskatchewan Government organizations, including the Saskatchewan Legislative Building, provincial government ministries, and agencies, boards, and commissions. Also, Crown Investments Corporation and a number of the Crown Corporations it holds, including SaskEnergy, Sask Gaming, SGI, SaskPower, and SaskTel, are based in Regina. The Innovation Place Research Park immediately adjacent to the University of Regina campus hosts several science and technology companies which conduct research activities in conjunction with University departments.

Oil and natural gas, potash, kaolin, sodium sulphite and bentonite contribute a great part of Regina and area&#x27;s economy. The completion of the train link between eastern Canada and the then-District of Assiniboia in 1885, the development of the high-yielding and early-maturing Marquis strain of wheat and the opening of new grain markets in the United Kingdom established the first impetus for economic development and substantial population settlement. The farm and agricultural component is still a significant part of the economy – the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (now Viterra Inc.,), &quot;the world&#x27;s largest grain-handling co-operative&quot; has its headquarters in Regina — but it is no longer the major driver; provincially it has slipped to eighth overall, well behind the natural resources sectors.

Modern transport has obviated the development of a significant manufacturing sector and local petroleum refining facilities: the General Motors assembly plant north on Winnipeg Street, built in 1927 – when Saskatchewan&#x27;s agricultural economy was booming and briefly made it the third province of Canada after Ontario and Quebec in both population (at just under one million people, roughly the same population as today) and GDP – ceased production during the depression of the 1930s. It was resumed by the federal crown during World War II and housed Regina Wartime Industries Ltd., where 1,000 people were engaged in armaments manufacture. It was not returned to private automotive manufacture after the war and became derelict. 

EVRAZ is a leading world producer of steel plate and pipe. Its Regina operations were founded as Prairie Pipe Manufacturing Company Ltd. on July 13, 1956, a steel pipe plant designed to build small-diameter pipe to serve the Saskatchewan market. The government-owned Saskatchewan Power Corporation, in the process of expanding Saskatchewan&#x27;s commercial and residential delivery of natural gas, agreed to purchase its tubular requirements from Prairie Pipe. To supply Prairie Pipe with its own steel supply, a new enterprise named Interprovincial Steel Corporation was founded in 1957, and built a small steel mill on property adjacent to Prairie Pipe. In 1959, Prairie Pipe purchased all the assets of Interprovincial Steel Corporation because the latter ran into financial difficulties. As a result of this merger, the company became known as Interprovincial Steel and Pipe Corporation, or IPSCO Inc. for short. As of July 2007, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish steel company SSAB. On June 12, 2008, Evraz completed its acquisition of IPSCO Inc. from SSAB for approximately US$2.9 billion.

Regina has had the presence of oil refineries in the city. The Co-op Refinery Complex maintains an refinery and, together with the Province, an upgrading operation for heavy crude oil. Imperial Oil (the Canadian subsidiary of Standard Oil, now ExxonMobil), maintained a refinery on Winnipeg Street in Regina for many years. This refinery shut down in 1975.

In the 1990s, a couple of organizations relocated their headquarters to Regina. Farm Credit Canada, a Federal Government Crown Corporation, relocated its headquarters to Regina from Ottawa in 1992. Crown Life, a significant Canadian and international insurance company, transferred its national head office from Toronto to Regina in 1993 but was acquired by Canada Life in 1998 and the corporate head office returned to Toronto, though with assurances that the company would retain a strong presence in Regina.

On 19 May 2009 it was announced that Viterra (formerly Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, becoming Viterra after acquisition of Agricore United), the largest grain handler in Canada, would acquire ABB Grain of Adelaide, South Australia in September 2009. The Head Office would be relocated to Regina, with the worldwide malting headquarters remaining in Adelaide. The two companies together are responsible for 37 percent of the world&#x27;s exports of wheat, canola and barley.

The Mosaic Company has an office in Regina. This office serves as the headquarters for the company&#x27;s Potash Business Unit.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schooling===
The Regina Public School Board currently operates 45 elementary schools and 9 high schools with approximately 21,000 students enrolled throughout the city. The publicly funded Regina Catholic Schools Separate School Board operates 25 elementary schools and 4 high schools, and has a current enrollment of approximately 10,000 students. Public and separate schools are amply equipped with state-of-the-art science labs, gymnasia, drama and arts facilities: already by the 1960s, Regina high schools had television studios, swimming pools, ice rinks and drama facilities. Francophone public schools are operated by the Conseil des écoles fransaskoises.

A small number of parents choose to opt out of the public and separate school systems for home-schooling under the guidance of the Regina Public School Board. Luther College (affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada) is a historical, independent high school; the Regina Huda School offers Islamic education; Harvest City Christian Academy is a private school (occupying the former Sister McGuigan High School site); and the Regina Christian School (in the former Campion College premises) operates as an Associate school of the Regina Public School Division. Historically there were eminent private schools long since closed: Regina College, now the University of Regina but originally a private high school of the Methodist Church of Canada (since 1925 the United Church); the Anglican St Chad&#x27;s School; the Roman Catholic Campion College, Sacred Heart Academy and Marian High School.

===University of Regina===
In the years prior to the establishment of the University of Saskatchewan, there was continued debate as to which Saskatchewan city would be awarded the provincial university: ultimately Saskatoon won out over Regina and in immediate reaction the Methodist Church of Canada established Regina College in 1911. Regina College was initially a denominational high school and junior college affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan – the later-established Campion and Luther Colleges, operated by the Roman Catholic Jesuit Order and Lutheran Church respectively, operated on the same basis. The Church of England concurrently established St Chad&#x27;s College, an Anglican theological training facility, and the Qu&#x27;Appelle Diocesan School on the Anglican diocesan property immediately to the east of Regina College on College Avenue. All were quasi-tertiary institutions.

Ultimately, the financially hard-pressed United Church of Canada (the successor to the Methodist Church), which in any case had ideological difficulties with the concept of fee-paying private schooling given its longstanding espousal of universal free education from the time of its early father Egerton Ryerson, could no longer maintain Regina College during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and Regina College was disaffiliated from the Church and surrendered to the University of Saskatchewan; it became the Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan in 1961. After a protracted contretemps over the siting of several faculties in Saskatoon which had been promised to the Regina campus, Regina Campus sought and obtained a separate charter as the University of Regina in 1974.

Campion College and Luther College now have federated college status in the University of Regina, as does the First Nations University of Canada; The United Church&#x27;s Regina College has entirely consolidated with the University of Saskatchewan and identified with St Andrew&#x27;s College there: despite the considerable historical involvement by the Methodist, Presbyterian and Anglican churches in antecedent institutions of the University of Regina. The Regina Research Park is located immediately adjacent to the main campus and many of its initiatives in information technology, petroleum and environmental sciences are conducted in conjunction with university departments. A member in the research park is Canada&#x27;s Petroleum Technology Research facility, a world leader in oil recovery and geological storage of CO2.

===Saskatchewan Polytechnic===

The Regina campus of this province-wide polytechnic institute is adjacent to the University of Regina. It occupies the former Plains Health Centre, previously a third hospital in Regina which in the course of rationalizing health services in Saskatchewan was in due course closed. It offers certificates, diplomas, and applied degrees in trade, skilled labour, and professional fields.

===RCMP Academy, Depot Division===
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Academy, &quot;Depot&quot; Division, is on the western perimeter of the city. As capital of the North-West Territories, Regina was the headquarters of the Royal North-West Mounted Police (the RCMP&#x27;s predecessor) before &quot;the Force&quot; became a national body with its headquarters in Ottawa in 1920. The city takes great pride in this national institution which is a major visitor attraction and a continuing link with Regina&#x27;s past as the headquarters of the Force, together with longstanding substantial enrollment by trainees from across Canada, obtaining entertainment and recreation citywide. It offers sunset ceremonies and parade in the summertime. The national RCMP music and &quot;Depot&quot; Division chapel (the oldest building still standing in the city) are major visitor attractions in Regina. The first phase of a RCMP Heritage Centre successor to the longstanding museum opened in May 2007.

==Infrastructure==

Domestic water was originally obtained from Wascana Lake and later the Boggy Creek reservoir north of the city and supplemented by wells, however by the 1940s this was proving inadequate to meet the city&#x27;s water supply needs. Today, drinking water is supplied from Buffalo Pound Lake in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley, an artificial reservoir on the Qu&#x27;Appelle River, since 1967 with water diverted into it from Lake Diefenbaker behind the Gardiner Dam on the South Saskatchewan River. Electricity is provided by SaskPower, a provincial Crown corporation which maintains a province-wide grid with power generated from coal-fired base load, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric and wind power facilities.

Medical services are provided through three city hospitals, Regina General, Pasqua (formerly Grey Nuns), and Wascana Rehabilitation Centre and by private medical practitioners, who, like hospitals, remit their bills to the public universal medical insurer, the Saskatchewan Medicare system.

===Policing===

The Regina Police Service is the primary police service for the city of Regina and holds both Municipal and Provincial Jurisdiction. It was formed in 1892. It employs 347 sworn officers and 139 unsworn employees. The current chief of police is Farooq Hassan Sheikh.

The following services also hold jurisdiction in the city and are in partnership: Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian National Railway Police Service and the Canadian Pacific Railway Police Service.

====Crime====
Despite having fallen in recent years, Regina&#x27;s crime rate remains among the highest in Canada. Regina&#x27;s overall police-reported crime rate was second highest in the country in 2012. Also, the relative severity of crimes in Regina is quite high and the city continues to top the national Crime Severity Index. Regina&#x27;s crime rate declined 10% from 2011 to 2012. Regina also has one of the highest rates of intravenous drug use in Canada.

==Transportation==
===Public transportation===
The city&#x27;s public transit agency, Regina Transit, operates a fleet of 110 buses, on 17 routes, and 4 express routes. The service runs 7 days a week with access to the city centre from most areas of the city. Regina formerly had an extensive streetcar (tramway) network but now has no streetcars, trains or subways. A massive fire at the streetcar barns, on 23 January 1949, destroyed much of the rolling stock of streetcars and trolley buses and helped to propel Regina&#x27;s diesel bus revolution in 1951, although until well into the 1970s the streetcar rails remained in the centre of many major streets, ready to be returned to use should city transit policy change. Because of the 1949 fire, original Regina streetcar rolling stock was rare, though through later years a few disused streetcars remained in evidence – a streetcar with takeaway food, for example, on the site of the Regina Theatre at 12th Avenue and Hamilton Street, until the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company acquired the site and built its 60s-through-90s department store there.
Major roads in the city include Ring Road, a high speed connection between Regina&#x27;s east and northwest that loops around the city&#x27;s east side. The west side of the loop is formed by a south-north route, Lewvan Drive, which becomes Pasqua Street in the city&#x27;s north end. This route connects the Trans-Canada highway and Highway 11. Also, the Regina Bypass encircles the city farther out.

===Inter-city transportation===

By road, Regina can be reached by several highways including the Trans-Canada Highway from the west and east sides and four provincial highways (6, 11, 33, 46) from other directions.

By air, Regina International Airport serves Regina and area. As of January 2023, non-stop scheduled flights go to and from Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg. There are seasonal flights to and from Montreal (summer), Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, and destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean (winter). The airport is situated on the west side of the city and is the oldest established commercial airport in Canada. The current, continually expanded, 1960 terminal replaces the original 1940 Art Deco terminal; it has recently undergone further major upgrades and expansions to allow it to handle increases in traffic for the next several years. Private aircraft is facilitated at the Regina Flying Club and Western Air hangars near the Regina International Airport.

By bus, Rider Express, whose Regina office and stop are located at 1517 11th Avenue, provides direct inter-city bus service from Regina to centres along the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 11. The Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC), a Saskatchewan Crown Corporation, provided bus service in the province until it was shut down in 2017. Greyhound Canada discontinued service in Saskatchewan and Western Canada in 2018. The five decades-old bus depot on Hamilton Street immediately south of the Hotel Saskatchewan was replaced in 2008 by one at 1717 Saskatchewan Drive (corner of Saskatchewan Drive and Broad Street). This building has been converted into the new Regina Police Service headquarters as of 2019.

By rail, inter-city passenger train service has not operated in Regina since 1990. In the past, passenger trains constituted the principal mode of transportation among Western Canadian cities. The last Via Rail train left Regina on January 16, 1990. Regina&#x27;s Union Station in the city&#x27;s downtown became Casino Regina.

==Media==

The daily newspaper for the city is &quot;The Leader-Post&quot;, first published in 1883 and currently owned by Postmedia Network. The &quot;Regina Sun&quot; was published on weekends by &quot;The Leader-Post&quot; and distributed free of charge until 2015.

&quot;Prairie Dog&quot; was established in 1993 and is a free alternative newspaper and blog produced by a Saskatchewan worker co-operative. &quot;L&#x27;eau vive&quot; is a weekly newspaper publishing in French and serving all of Saskatchewan&#x27;s francophone community.

The thirteen radio stations broadcasting from the city include CHBD-FM 92.7, CKRM 620, CJME News/Talk 980, FM 90.3 CJLR-FM-4 MBC Radio First Nations community radio Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation, FM 91.3 CJTR-FM 91.3 CJTR community radio, FM 97.7 CBKF-FM Première Chaîne news/talk (CBC, French), and FM 102.5 CBKR-FM CBC Radio One news/talk (CBC).

There are four private and public television channels broadcasting from Regina: CKCK-TV (CTV), CBKT (CBC), CFRE-TV (Global), and CBKFT (SRC). Educational channel City Saskatchewan (formerly the Saskatchewan Communications Network) and a community channel owned by Regina&#x27;s cable provider Access Communications are also available on cable.

== Friendship and sister city relations ==
The City of Regina maintains trade development programs, cultural, and educational partnerships in a twinning agreement with Bucharest, Romania and Jinan, Shandong, China, and a friendship agreement with Fujioka, Gunma, Japan.

<text>Winnipeg () is the capital and largest city of the Canadian province of Manitoba. It is centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, near the longitudinal centre of North America. , Winnipeg had a city population of 749,607 and a metropolitan population of 834,678, making it Canada&#x27;s sixth-largest city and eighth-largest metropolitan area.

The city is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name comes from the Western Cree words for &#x27;muddy water&#x27; – . The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans; it is the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe (Ojibway), Ininew (Cree), Oji-Cree, Dene, and Dakota, and is the birthplace of the Métis Nation. French traders built the first fort, Fort Rouge, on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. Being far inland, the city&#x27;s climate is extremely seasonal (continental) even by Canadian standards, with average January highs of around and average July highs of .

Known as the &quot;Gateway to the West&quot;, Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the , the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American Games in 1967. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), Manitoba Moose (ice hockey), Valour FC (soccer), Winnipeg Sea Bears (basketball), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball).

== Etymology ==
Winnipeg is named after nearby Lake Winnipeg, north of the city. English explorer Henry Kelsey may have been the first European to see the lake in 1690. He adopted the Cree and Ojibwe name (also transcribed or ) meaning &quot;murky water&quot; or &quot;muddy water&quot; (modern , ). French-Canadian fur trader La Vérendrye referred to the lake as or when he built the first forts in the area in the 1730s. Local newspaper &quot;The Nor&#x27;-Wester&quot; included the name on its masthead on 24 February 1866, and the city was incorporated by that name by the Manitoba Legislature in 1873.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Winnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North, a location now known as &quot;the Forks.&quot; This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by First Nations before European contact. Evidence provided by archaeology, petroglyphs, rock art, and oral history indicates that native peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture.

Estimates of the date of first settlement in the area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at the Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made some of the first maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.

Sieur de La Vérendrye built the first fur-trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge. French trading continued at the site for several decades. The British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company took over when France ceded the territory following its defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Many French men who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. Their descendants are known as the Métis.

Lord Selkirk was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The Métis and Lord Selkirk&#x27;s settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway in downtown Winnipeg.

In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to suppress the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. Treaty 1, which encompassed the city and much of the surrounding area, was signed on 3 August 1871 by representatives of the Crown and local Indigenous groups, comprising the Brokenhead Ojibway, Sagkeeng, Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Sandy Bay and Swan Lake communities. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. Métis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city. Winnipeg&#x27;s mandate was to govern and provide municipal services to citizens attracted to trade expansion between Upper Fort Garry / Lower Fort Garry and Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.

===Modern history (1900–present)===
By 1911, Winnipeg was Canada&#x27;s third-largest city. However, the city faced financial difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914. The canal reduced reliance on Canada&#x27;s rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping traffic helped Vancouver to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population by the end of World War I.

More than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read. A group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as &quot;Bloody Saturday&quot;; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada&#x27;s first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.

The Manitoba Legislative Building, constructed mainly of Tyndall stone, opened in 1920; its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled &quot;Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Golden Boy&quot;). The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression resulted in widespread unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices. The Depression ended after the start of World War II in 1939.

In the Battle of Hong Kong, The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps. In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood. The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that. The damage caused by the flood led then-Premier Duff Roblin to advocate for the construction of the Red River Floodway.

Before 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. In 1960, the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was established to co-ordinate service delivery in the metropolitan region. A consolidated metropolitan &quot;unicity&quot; government incorporating Winnipeg and its surrounding municipalities was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972. The City of Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city. In 2003, the City of Winnipeg Act was repealed and replaced with the City of Winnipeg Charter.

Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession, during which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the &quot;Winnipeg Tribune&quot;, as well as the Swift&#x27;s and Canada Packers meat packing plants. In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments to redevelop its downtown area, and the three levels of government contributed over $271 million to its development. In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards turned the Forks into Winnipeg&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction. The city was threatened by the 1997 Red River flood as well as further floods in 2009 and 2011.

==Geography==

Winnipeg lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley, a flood plain with an extremely flat topography. It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada and is known as the &quot;Gateway to the West&quot;. Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization. It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the Earth&#x27;s 11th largest freshwater lake). Winnipeg has North America&#x27;s largest extant mature urban elm forest. The city has an area of .

Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city was subject to severe flooding in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood in 1950 caused millions of dollars in damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin&#x27;s provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to the flood&#x27;s impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley&#x27;s clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.

===Climate===
Winnipeg&#x27;s location in the Canadian Prairies gives it a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), with warm, humid summers, and long, severely cold winters. Summers have a July mean average of . Winters are the coldest time of year, with the January mean average around and total winter precipitation (December through February) averaging . Temperatures occasionally drop below .

On average, there are 317.8 days per year with measurable sunshine, with July seeing the most. With 2,353 hours of sunshine per year, Winnipeg is the second-sunniest city in Canada. Total annual precipitation (both rain and snow) is just over . Thunderstorms are very common during summer and sometimes severe enough to produce tornadoes. Low wind chill values are a common occurrence in the local climate. The wind chill has gone down as low as , and on average twelve days of the year reach a wind chill below .

The highest temperature ever recorded in Winnipeg was during the 1936 North American heat wave. The temperature reached on 11 July 1936 while the highest minimum temperature, recorded on the following day, 12 July 1936, was . The apparent heat can be even more extreme due to bursts of humidity, and on 25 July 2007 a humidex reading of was measured.

The frost-free season is comparatively long for a location with such severe winters. The last spring frost is on average around 23 May, while the first fall frost is on 22 September.

===Cityscape===

There are officially 236 neighbourhoods in Winnipeg. Downtown Winnipeg, the city&#x27;s financial heart and economic core, is centred on the intersection of Portage Avenue and Main Street and covers about . More than 72,000 people work downtown, and over 40,000 students attend classes at its universities and colleges.

Downtown Winnipeg&#x27;s Exchange District is named after the area&#x27;s original grain exchange, which operated from 1880 to 1913. The 30-block district received National Historic Site of Canada status in 1997; it includes North America&#x27;s most extensive collection of early 20th-century terracotta and cut stone architecture, Stephen Juba Park, and Old Market Square. Other major downtown areas are the Forks, Central Park, Broadway-Assiniboine and Chinatown. Many of Downtown Winnipeg&#x27;s major buildings are linked with the Winnipeg Walkway.
Residential neighbourhoods surround the downtown in all directions; expansion is greatest to the south and west, although several areas remain underdeveloped. The city&#x27;s largest park, Assiniboine Park, houses the Assiniboine Park Zoo and the Leo Mol Sculpture Garden. Other large city parks include Kildonan Park and St. Vital Park. The city&#x27;s major commercial areas are Polo Park, Kildonan Crossing, South St. Vital, Garden City (West Kildonan), Pembina Strip, Kenaston Smart Centre, Osborne Village, and the Corydon strip. The main cultural and nightlife areas are the Exchange District, the Forks, Osborne Village and Corydon Village (both in Fort Rouge), Sargent and Ellice Avenues (West End) and Old St. Boniface. Osborne Village is Winnipeg&#x27;s most densely populated neighbourhood and one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in Western Canada.

<text>Kahone or Kawon is a town and urban commune near Kaolack, Senegal. It was the capital of the pre-colonial Kingdom of Saloum and is a center of Serer culture and history.

==History==
In the 14th century, the Mandinka Guelowar clan migrated from Kaabu northwards after losing a succession dispute. They founded a number of small chiefdoms in the area north of the Gambia river. The home of Kéno Mbèye, one of the Guelowar leaders, was chosen as the meeting place where and problems could be discussed, and so it was called &quot;Filagui diobé&quot;, meaning meeting place in the Mandinka language. This eventually became Njoob, capital of a state called Mbey.

In the late 15th century, Mbey and its prosperous salt works fell under the influence of a Toucouleur marabout named Elibana. The Siin-Siin leader Mbegane Ndour attacked and killed him, establishing the Serer kingdom of Saloum and renaming the capital Kahone, meaning &#x27;this is the one&#x27; in Serer. The city remained the political and religious center of Saloum for the next several centuries.

Kahone was originally a far more important town than neighboring Kaolack, but the roles have been reversed in the 20th century as Kaolack developed into a port and railroad hub. Kahone has been reduced to a sub-prefecture of Kaolack. 

==Culture and Economy==
It is primarily agricultural, but it is participating in industrial development plans. Also, the town is pursuing increased tourism based on its history and culture. An annual royal festival is celebrated in which the O Maad (Serer king), Djaraaf (Serer prime minister) and other dignitaries meet to decide kingdom issues and hold pageants celebrating the history of Saloum and the Serer people. There is a mosque and a Catholic missions in Kahone. There are numerous ancient tombs, stone circles and megaliths in the vicinity as well as large burial mounds implanted with baobab trees.

Kahone is routinely involved in many administrative territorial disputes with neighboring communes, always emphasizing its earlier importance.

In 2007, according to official estimates, Kahone had 5,852 inhabitants.

<text>The Guarani are a group of culturally-related indigenous peoples of South America. They are distinguished from the related Tupi by their use of the Guarani language. The traditional range of the Guarani people is in what is now Paraguay between the Paraná River and lower Paraguay River, the Misiones Province of Argentina, southern Brazil once as far east as Rio de Janeiro, and parts of Uruguay and Bolivia.

Although their demographic dominance of the region has been reduced by European colonisation and the commensurate rise of mestizos, there are contemporary Guarani populations in Paraguay and parts of Argentina and Bolivia. Most notably, the Guarani language, still widely spoken across traditional Guarani homelands, is one of the two official languages in Paraguay, the other one being Spanish. The Paraguayan population learns Guarani both informally from social interaction and formally in public schools. In modern Spanish, &quot;Guarani&quot; also refers to any Paraguayan national in the same way that the French are sometimes called Gauls.

==Name==
The history and meaning of the name &quot;Guarani&quot; are subject to dispute. Before they encountered Europeans, the Guarani referred to themselves simply as &quot;Abá&quot;, meaning &quot;men&quot; or &quot;people&quot;. The term Guarani was originally applied by early Jesuit missionaries to refer to natives who had accepted conversion to the Christian religion; &quot;Cayua&quot; or &quot;Caingua&quot; (&quot;ka&#x27;aguygua&quot;) was used to refer to those who had refused it. &quot;Cayua&quot; is roughly translated as &quot;the ones from the jungle&quot;. While the term Cayua is sometimes still used to refer to settlements of indigenous peoples who have not well integrated into the dominant society, the modern usage of the name Guarani is generally extended to include all people of native origin regardless of societal status. Barbara Ganson writes that the name &quot;Guarani&quot; was given by the Spanish since it means &quot;warrior&quot; in the Tupi-Guaraní dialect spoken there. &quot;Guarinĩ&quot; is attested in 16th-century Old Tupi, by Jesuit sources, as &quot;war, warrior, to wage war, warlord&quot;.

==History, myth and legend==
Early Guarani villages often consisted of communal houses for 10 to 15 families. Communities were united by common interest and language, and tended to form tribal groups by dialect. It is estimated that the Guarani numbered some 400,000 people when they were first encountered by Europeans. At that time, they were sedentary and agricultural, subsisting largely on manioc, maize, wild game, and honey.

Equally little is known about early Guarani society and beliefs. They practiced a form of animistic pantheism, much of which has survived in the form of folklore and numerous myths. According to the Jesuit missionary Martin Dobrizhoffer, they practiced cannibalism at one point, perhaps as a funerary ritual, but later disposed of the dead in large jars placed inverted on the ground. Guarani mythology is still widespread in rural Paraguay.

Much Guarani myth and legend were compiled by the Universidad Nacional de Misiones in northern Argentina and published as &quot;Myths and Legends: A Journey around the Guarani Lands, Anthology&quot; in 1870 (translated into the English language in 1906). Guarani myth and legend can roughly be divided into the following broad categories:

* Cosmogonic and eschatological myths; the creation and destruction of all things as dictated by &quot;the true father, the first one&quot;. After him comes a pantheon of gods, chief among them Yporú who is more frequently known as Tupã. Jasy is another &quot;good&quot; deity who rules the night while is a malign deity who dwells at the bottom of the Iguazu River.
* Animistic mythology, that is animals, plants and minerals being animated and capable of becoming anthropomorphic beings or in reverse the transmuted souls of people, either born or unborn, who have become animals, plants and minerals. The course of such anthropomorphism appears dictated by the pantheon of god-like deities because of their virtues or vices. Such animistic legends include that of the Lobizón, a werewolf-type being, and the Mainumby or hummingbird who transports good spirits that are resident in flowers back to Tupá &quot;so he can cherish them&quot;. Isondú or glowworms are the reincarnated spirits of certain people, as are the Panambi (butterflies). Ka&#x27;a Jarýi was a woman who became the sacred herb Yerba; Irupé was a woman who was turned into the giant lily because she fell in love with the moon.
* Pombero are goblin or elf-like spirits who dwell in the forest and must be appeased. They have never been human. Principal among these is Jasy Jatere who has never been human and like all Pombero is from a different realm. His characteristics are vague and uncertain, and his powers are badly defined as is the place where he resides. He is described in one legend as a &quot;handsome, thickly bearded, blond dwarf&quot; who is naked and lives in tree trunks. Other versions say he loves honey, his feet are backward, and he is an &quot;ugly, lame, old man&quot;. Most legends agree that he snatches children and &quot;licks them&quot;, wrapping them in climbing plants or drowning them in rivers. To appease him gifts, such as honey, are left in places in the forest associated with him. Another Pombero is Kuarahy Jára who whistles like birds and is their protector. He can be your friend but is known for abducting young boys who are alone and trying to catch birds. If necessary he can take the form of a person, a tree or a hyacinth. Finally, Kurupi is a phallic mythological figure who will copulate with young women. He has scaly skin like a lizard, hypnotic eyes, and an enormous penis.

The Iguazu Falls, considered sacred by the Guarani, hold special significance and are the inspiration for numerous myths and legends. They reveal the sound of ancient battles at certain times, they are also the place where I-Yara—a malign Pomboro spirit—abducted Angá—a fair maiden—and hid her. The swallows that inhabit the falls to this day vainly search for her.

===European contact===

In 1537, Gonzalo de Mendoza traversed through Paraguay to about the present Brazilian frontier. On his return, he made acquaintance with the Guarani and founded the city of Asunción, later the capital of Paraguay. The first governor of the Spanish territory of Guayrá initiated a policy of intermarriage between European men and indigenous women; the descendants of these matches characterize the Paraguayan nation today. The Laws of the Indies forbade slavery in Hispanic America.

The first two Jesuits, Father Barcena and Father Angulo, came to what is now the State of Paraná, Southern Brazil, in 1585, by land from the west. Others soon followed, and a Jesuit college was established at Asunción. In 1608, as a result of the Jesuit protest against the enslavement of the indigenous population, King Philip III of Spain gave authority to the Jesuits to convert and colonize the tribes of Guayrá. In the early period, the name Paraguay was loosely used to designate the entire river basin, including parts of what are now Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.

Exploring expeditions were accompanied by Franciscan friars. Early in the history of Asunción, Father Luis de Bolaños translated the catechism into the Guarani language and preached to Guarani people who resided in the area around the settlement. In 1588–89 St. Francis Solanus crossed the Chaco wilderness from Peru and stopped at Asunción, but gave no attention to the Guarani. His departure left the Jesuits alone with their missionary work, and to defend the natives against slave dealers. The Jesuit provincial Torres arrived in 1607, and &quot;immediately placed himself at the head of those who had opposed the cruelties at all times exercised over the natives&quot;.

===Cultural preservation===
Today, the Guarani language is an official language of Paraguay and Bolivia. As of 2012, an estimated 90% of the people in Paraguay spoke Guarani.

===Slavery===
The center depot of the slave trade was the town of São Paulo. Originally a rendezvous place for Portuguese and Dutch pirates, it later became a refuge for criminals, who mixed with Native American and African women and actively participated in the capturing and selling of Guaranis as slaves.

To oppose these armed and organized robbers, the tribes had only their bows and arrows. Many Guaranis were slain or enslaved by the slave hunters active in Brazil during those years.

===The Paraguayan Reductions===
In 1607, Spanish King Philip III sent a letter to the governor of Rio de Plata Hernandarias de Saavedra to instruct him to send the newly arrived Jesuits to begin their missionary work. With Spanish royal protection, the first Guayrá mission, Loreto, was established on the Paranapanema by Father Joseph Cataldino and Father Simon Macerata in 1610. The Jesuit priest Father Ruiz de Montoya discussed the difficulties of spreading the missions and his interactions with the Guarani in his book &quot;The Spiritual Conquest&quot;. Ruiz de Montoya wrote that one of the Guarani caciques Miguel Artiguaye initially refused to join the missions until threatened by another Indigenous group. Artiguaye then returned to the mission and begged for protection. As the mission provided the only real possible protection against enslavement, the Guarani flocked there in such numbers that twelve more missions were created in rapid succession, containing all 40,000 Guaranis. The Jesuits were seen as intermediaries between the Spanish authorities and the Guarani caciques. The Jesuit missions needed new converts and required workers to assist in the maintenance of the missions. The Guarani helped grow the crops to sustain the missions&#x27; populations and also produce goods to sell and trade to fund the missions.
Stimulated by this success, Father González and two companions journeyed to the east bank of the Uruguay River (now the country of Uruguay) and established two or three small missions in 1627. The local tribes killed the priests and the neophytes and burned the missions.

Slave raiders saw the Guarani missions as &quot;merely an opportunity of capturing more Indians than usual at a haul&quot;. In 1629, an army of Paulistas surrounded the San Antonio mission, set fire to the church and other buildings, killed those who resisted or were too young or too old to travel, and carried the rest into slavery. San Miguel and Jesus Maria quickly met the same fate. Eventually, reinforcements gathered by Father Cataldino drove off the slavers. Within two years, all but two of the establishments were destroyed, and 60,000 Christian converts were carried off for sale to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The attacks usually took place on Sunday, when the whole mission population was gathered for Mass. The priests were usually spared, but several were killed.

Only a few thousand natives were left of nearly 100,000 just before the Paulista invasion. Father Antonio Ruiz de Montoya purchased 10,000 cattle, and was able to convert the natives from farmers to stock raisers. Soon under Fathers Rançoncier and Romero the Uruguay missions were re-established. In 1632 the Mamelucos discovered a new line of attack from the south. In 1638, despite some successful resistance, all twelve of the missions beyond the Uruguay River were abandoned and their people consolidated with the community of the Missions Territory. In the last raid Father Alfaro was killed.

In the same year Father Montoya, after having successfully opposed the attempts of the governor and the bishop of Asunción to reduce the natives&#x27; liberties and the mission administration, sailed for Europe. On this trip he was successful in obtaining letters from Pope Urban VIII forbidding the enslavement of the missionaries under the severest church penalties, and from King Philip IV of Spain, permitting Guaranis to carry firearms for defense and to be trained in their use by veteran soldiers who had become Jesuits.

When the next Paulista army, 800 strong, attacked the missions in 1641 they were met by a body of Christian Guarani armed with guns on the Acaray River. In two battles, the Paulista army suffered a defeat that warded off invasions for ten years. In 1651, the war between Spain and Portugal encouraged another Paulista attack to gain territory for Portugal. Before Spanish troops could arrive to help defend the missions, the fathers themselves led a Guarani army against the enemy. In 1732, at the time of their greatest prosperity, the Guarani missions were guarded by a well-drilled and well-equipped army of 7,000 Guaranis. On more than one occasion this mission army, accompanied by their priests, defended the Spanish colony.

In 1732, there were 30 Guarani missions with 141,252 converted Guaranis. Two years later a smallpox epidemic killed approximately 30,000 of them. In 1765, a second outbreak killed approximately 12,000 more, and then spread westward through the tribes of the Chaco.

====Uruguay missions saved====
In 1750 the Treaty of Madrid between Spain and Portugal transferred to Portugal the territory of the seven missions on the Uruguay River, and the Guaranis were ordered to leave; they refused, being familiar with the Portuguese as slave hunters. Seven years of guerrilla warfare killed thousands of them (see Guarani War). The Jesuits secured a royal decree restoring the disputed mission territory to Spanish jurisdiction. Two missions in 1747 and a third in 1760 were established in the sub-tribe of the Itatínes, or Tobatines, in central Paraguay, far north of the older mission group. In one of these, (founded 1747), Martin Dobrizhoffer ministered for eight years.

====Jesuits expelled====

In 1767, the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish dominions by royal edict. Fearing the outcome of this decision, viceroy Antonio María Bucareli y Ursúa entrusted the execution of the mandate in 1768 to two officers with a force of 500 troops. Despite their mission army of 14,000, the Jesuits submitted without resistance. Guarani caciques from Mission San Luis wrote a letter to the Governor of Buenos Aires on February 28, 1768, to ask for the Jesuits to stay. They wrote, &quot;The fathers of the Company of Jesus know how to get along with us, and we with them, we are happy serving God and the King.&quot; The Guarani request was denied, but the letter highlights the value of the relationship the Jesuits and Guarani had established in the region.

====Decline of the reductions====

The missions were turned over to priests of other orders, chiefly Franciscans, but under a code of regulations drawn up by the viceroy and modeled largely on the Jesuit system. Under chaotic political regulation, the missions rapidly declined. Most Guaranis returned to the countryside. According to the official census of 1801, fewer than 45,000 Guaranis remained; cattle, sheep, and horses had disappeared; the fields and orchards were overgrown or cut down, and the churches were in ruins. The long period of revolutionary struggle that followed completed the destruction. In 1814, the mission Indians numbered 8,000, and in 1848 the few who remained were declared citizens.

====Aftermath====
A 2018 study in &quot;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; found that &quot;in areas of former Jesuit presence—within the Guarani area—educational attainment was higher and remains so (by 10–15%) 250 years later. These educational differences have also translated into incomes that are 10% higher today. The identification of the positive effect of the Guarani Jesuit missions emerges after comparing them with abandoned Jesuit missions and neighboring Franciscan Guarani missions. The enduring effects observed are consistent with transmission mechanisms of structural transformation, occupational specialization, and technology adoption in agriculture.&quot;

===Eastern Bolivian Guarani===

The Guarani people in Bolivia, called Chiriguanos, lived in the foothills of the Andes and had a different history than most other Guarani people. Noted for their warlike character, the Chiriguanos were hostile in turn to the Inca Empire, the Spanish, and the independent state of Bolivia from the late 15th to the late 19th century. The Jesuit missions had little success among the Chiriguanos, although Franciscans in the 19th century attracted numerous converts. The Chririguanos were not finally pacified until the defeat in 1892 of forces led by their messianic leader Apiaguaiki Tumpa in the Battle of Kuruyuki.

==Today==
===Argentina===
Indigenous Guarani in Argentina fight to protect their ancestral lands from illegal logging and government neglect. A group formed by members of the Guarani community called &quot;Los Rumberos,&quot; or “The Patrollers,” safeguard the forest to deter further encroachment.

===Paraguay===
The Guarani people and culture persist. Many are descendants of mission exiles. In Paraguay, Guarani lineage predominates in the population and the Guarani language is spoken in most departments to this day.
===Bolivia===
The Eastern Bolivian Guarani, being one of many indigenous peoples in Bolivia, live in the Gran Chaco, near the Pilcomayo River, in southeastern Bolivia close to the Paraguayan and Argentine borders, including portions of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, Tarija Departments. This region reaches nearly as far north as Santa Cruz de la Sierra and includes portions of the Guapay, Parapetí, and Ɨtɨka Guasu (or Pilcomayo) River valleys. The Bolivian Guarani are represented by the Assembly of the Guarani People. Some Guarani placenames in Bolivia: Yacuiba, Paraimiri, , Tatarenda, Saipurú, Capirenda, Itay, Ibamiragera, Carandaytí, Ipaguasú, Abapó, Timboy, Caraparí, Urubichá, , Guanay, Yaguarú and Rogagua.

There are three principal subgroups of Guarani in Bolivia, marked by dialectical and historical differences:
* Around fifty thousand Ava Guarani principally in the Andean foothills. &quot;Ava&quot; means &quot;man&quot; in Guarani, and thus &quot;Ava Guarani&quot; has become the name for numerous Guarani ethnic groups in Paraguay and Brazil.
* Simba (Quechua: &quot;braid&quot;) Guarani who live near the Pilcomayo River and have been identified by men maintaining a tradition of braided hair, although most young men no longer uphold this practice. They are sometimes called Guarani katui (Guarani: &quot;Guarani par excellence&quot;)
* The Izoceño Guarani or Tapɨi of Izozog who live in the region of Ɨsoso or Izozo on the Parapetí River

==Language==

Today, the Standard Paraguayan Guarani is flourishing in Paraguay and is taught in 12 countries;

The growing Paraguayan immigration to Argentina has led to a cultural enhancement of the Guarani peoples in Argentina. It can also be seen in Spain, due to the intense Paraguayan immigration to Spain

The language was also used by other tribes in regions like the Paraguayan Chaco and Northern Argentina.

==Notable Guarani people==

* Juliana, a 16th-century woman known for killing her Spanish master and urging other indigenous women to do the same
*Sepé Tiarayú, Guarani War leader popularly venerated as a saint in Brazil and Argentina

<text>Jethro Tull (baptised 30 March 1674 – 21 February 1741, New Style) was an English agriculturist from Berkshire who helped to bring about the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century. He perfected a horse-drawn seed drill in 1701 that economically sowed the seeds in neat rows, and later developed a horse-drawn hoe. Tull&#x27;s methods were adopted by many landowners and helped to provide the basis for modern agriculture.

==Biography==
Tull was born, probably in Basildon, Berkshire, to Jethro Tull and his wife Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Buckeridge, of Basildon and Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; Clarke. He was baptised at Basildon on 30 March 1674, grew up in Bradfield, Berkshire, and matriculated at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, at age 17. He trained for the legal profession, but appears to have not taken a degree. He became a member of Staple Inn and was called to the bar on 11 December 1693 by the benchers of Gray&#x27;s Inn.

Tull married Susanna, daughter of John Smith, of Burton Dassett, Warwickshire. They settled on his father&#x27;s farm at Howberry, near Crowmarsh Gifford, Oxfordshire, where they had one son and two daughters.

Soon after his call to the bar, Tull became ill with a pulmonary disorder and travelled to Europe in search of a cure. He spent a considerable amount of time at Montpellier in the south of France. During his tour, Tull carefully compared the agriculture of France and Italy with that of his own country, and lost no chance to observe and note everything which supported his own views and discoveries. On more than one occasion, he alluded in his work to the similarity of his own horse-hoe husbandry to the practice followed by the vine-dressers of the south of Europe in constantly hoeing or otherwise stirring their ground. Finding that they did not approve of dunging their vineyards, Tull readily adduced the fact in favour of his own favourite theory: that manuring soil is an unnecessary operation. Returning to England, in 1709 he took into his own hands the farm called Prosperous, at Shalbourne (then in Berkshire, now in Wiltshire). Here, resuming the agricultural efforts he had commenced earlier, he wrote his book &quot;Horse-hoeing Husbandry&quot; (1731).
Tull died on 21 February 1741 at Prosperous Farm and is buried in the graveyard of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Lower Basildon, Berkshire (now redundant), where he had been baptised. His modern gravestone bears the burial date 9 March 1740 using the Old Style calendar, which is equivalent to the modern date 20 March 1741.

==Work==
In his travels, Tull found himself seeking more knowledge of agriculture. Influenced by the early Age of Enlightenment, he is considered to be one of the early proponents of a scientific – and especially empirical – approach to agriculture. He helped transform agricultural practices by inventing or improving numerous implements.

Tull made early advances in planting crops with his invention of the seed drill (1701) – a mechanical seeder that sowed efficiently at the correct depth and spacing and then covered the seed so that it could grow. Before the introduction of the seed drill, the common practice was to plant seeds by broadcasting (evenly throwing) them across the ground by hand on the prepared soil and then lightly harrowing the soil to bury the seeds to the correct depth.

At a later period (1730–1740), Tull devoted all his energies to promote the introduction of this machine, &quot;more especially as it admitted the use of the hoe.&quot;

In his book &quot;Horse-hoeing Husbandry&quot; (published in 1731), Tull described how the motivation for developing the seed-drill arose from conflict with his servants. He had struggled to enforce his new methods upon them, in part because they resisted the threat to their position as labourers and their skill with the plough.

===Drill husbandry===

Tull invented some machinery for the purpose of carrying out his system of drill husbandry, about 1733. His first invention was a drill-plough to sow wheat and turnip seed in drills, three rows at a time. There were two boxes for the seed, and these, with the coulters, were placed one set behind the other, so that two sorts of seed might be sown at the same time. A harrow to cover in the seed was attached behind.

Tull also invented a turnip-drill somewhat similar to the other in general arrangement, but of lighter construction. The feeding spout was so arranged as to carry one half of the seed backwards after the earth had fallen into the channel; a harrow was pinned to the beam; and by this arrangement one half of the seed would spring up sooner than the other, allowing part to escape the turnip fly.

When desirable to turn the machine, the harrow was to be lifted and the feeding would stop. The manner of delivering the seeds to the funnels in both the above drills was by notched barrels, and Tull was the first to use cavities in the surfaces of solid cylinders for the feeding. Nothing material in the history of the drill then occurred until 1782.

===Growing soil===
Tull considered soil to be the sole food of plants. &quot;Too much nitre,&quot; Tull wrote, &quot;corrodes a plant, too much water drowns it, too much air dries the roots of it, too much heat burns it; but too much earth a plant can never have, unless it be therein wholly buried: too much earth or too fine can never possibly be given to their roots, for they never receive so much of it as to surfeit the plant.&quot; Again, he declares elsewhere, &quot;That which nourishes and augments a plant is the true food of it. Every plant is earth, and the growth and true increase of a plant is the addition of more earth.&quot; And in his chapter on the &quot;Pasture of Plants&quot;, Tull told his readers with great gravity that &quot;this pasturage is the inner or internal superficies &quot;[sic]&quot; of the earth; or, which is the same thing, it is the superficies of the pores, cavities, or interstices of the divided parts of the earth, which are of two sorts, natural and artificial. The mouths or lacteals of roots take their pabulum, being fine particles of earth, from the superficies of the pores or cavities, wherein their roots are included.&quot;

Tull wrote with enthusiasm and carried his admiration of the powers of the earth to support vegetation too far; he was deceived, in fact, by the effects of his finely pulverising system of tillage, and did not sufficiently attend to the fact that there are many other substances in the commonly cultivated soils of the farmer besides the earths, and that so far from their being always the chief constituents of the soil, they very often form the smallest portion of even a highly productive field.

That the four earths of which all cultivated soils are composed are all the necessary food or constituents of vegetables has, long since Tull wrote, been decided by accurate investigations of chemists. Of these, lime, either as a carbonate or an acetate or a sulphate, is by far the most generally present in plants; indeed, in one form or another, it is rarely absent from them. The presence of silica (flint) is almost equally general. Magnesia is less usually present, or, at least, it exists in smaller proportions; and the same remark applies to alumina (clay).

===Hoeing by hand===
The operation of hoeing is beneficial, not only as being destructive of weeds, but as loosening the surface of the soil, and rendering it more permeable to the gases and aqueous vapour of the atmosphere. Hoeing, therefore, not only protects the farmer&#x27;s crops from being weakened by weeds, but it renders the soil itself as more capable of supplying the plants with their food. Tull was the first who inculcated the advantages of hoeing cultivated soils. He correctly enough told the farmers of his time, that as fine hoed ground is not so long soaked by rain, so the dews never suffer it to become perfectly dry. This appears by the plants which flourish in this, whilst those in the hard ground are starved. In the driest weather good hoeing procures moisture to the roots of plants, though the ignorant and incurious fancy it lets in the drought.

==Legacy==
Tull&#x27;s work on agriculture initiated a new movement in 18th-century agriculture called &quot;horse-hoeing husbandry&quot; or &quot;new husbandry&quot;. His system was supported by Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau in France, Michel Lullin de Chateauvieux in Switzerland, John Mills in England, and many others. It offered two major innovations:

*&quot;Scarifiers and horse hoes&quot;: These implements were unknown until the 18th century. &quot;Hoeing by manual labour had, in very early ages, been partially practised; for the earliest writers [...] recommended particular attention to the cutting down and destroying of weeds. But to Jethro Tull, is indisputably due the honour of having first demonstrated the importance of frequent hoeing, not merely to extirpate weeds, but for the purpose of pulverizing the soil, by which process the gases and moisture of the atmosphere are enabled more freely to penetrate to the roots of the crop.&quot;
*&quot;The use of drills&quot;: In Roman agriculture the endeavour was &quot;to attain the advantages incident to row-culture by ploughing in their seeds. A rude machine [has] been used immemorially in India for sowing in rows. The first drill for this purpose introduced into Europe seems to have been the invention of a German, who made it known to the Spanish court in 1647.&quot; &quot;It was first brought much into notice in this country by Tull, in 1731; but the practice did not come into any thing like general adoption till the commencement of the [19th] century.&quot; By then there were &quot;several improved machines adapted to the sowing of corn, beans, and turnips.&quot;

The influence of the atmosphere on the soil and the increased fertility produced by pulverising and stirring heavy lands led to the notion adopted by Tull that labour might entirely supersede the necessity of manure: hence the origin of the horse-hoeing husbandry, which at one time was so highly thought of as to be called, by way of distinction, the &quot;new&quot; husbandry.

Fallows and manuring were both discarded as unnecessary; the seed was sown in rows with wide intervals, which were continually kept worked and stirred. At first the result was highly satisfactory; all the humus, by exposure to the air, was converted into soluble extract and taken up by the plants, which thrived well as long as the supply lasted: but in the end the soil was exhausted; and the warmest admirers and supporters of Tull&#x27;s system, Du Hamel and De Chateauvieux, besides many others, found in practice that pulverising alone will not restore fertility. However, the system of drilling and horse-hoeing, when united with judicious manuring, has been found a great improvement in agriculture.

Tull&#x27;s book upon husbandry also influenced cotton culture in the American Southern Colonies. Tull&#x27;s system taught that to ensure a sufficient number of plants, they did not just need to increase the quantity of seed, but to plant the seed at regular distances.

===Tull&#x27;s farm===
After Tull&#x27;s death, his holdings of about of freehold land in Berkshire found their way into Chancery, and were sold by order in 1784 to a Mr Blandy. Tull held about of additional land by a different tenure. The old brew-house he dwelt in has been modernised, but remains largely intact – as late as 1840 it was said to be in very good condition. Of the outhouses, Tull&#x27;s granary and his stables remain, although deteriorating. At the end of the granary, which Tull built, is an old well. When it was cleared out some years ago, there was found under the accumulated mud of nearly a century a three-pronged hoe, which is likely to have belonged to Tull and is now in the museum of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. It may have been thrown by his men, who adopted new types of tool with reluctance and reportedly thwarted him in many ways.

Tull&#x27;s Prosperous Farm in the rural parish of Shalbourne, under the Coomb Hills about south of Hungerford, long remained an object of interest to lovers of agriculture. Arthur Young made a pilgrimage there and William Cobbett did the same. The farmhouse was rebuilt in the 19th century.

==Rejection of Virgilian husbandry: debate with Stephen Switzer==
While supported by a number of powerful patrons, Tull&#x27;s revolutionary claims regarding horse-hoeing husbandry and rejection of Virgilian, &quot;old&quot; husbandry presented in &quot;The Horse-Hoeing Husbandry&quot; drew fire from a variety of critics. One of his most vehement dissenters was Stephen Switzer, a contemporary landscape gardener and leader of the Private Society of Husbandmen and Planters. Following the publication of &quot;The Horse-Hoeing Husbandry: Or, An Essay on the Principles of Tillage and Vegetation&quot; in 1731, Switzer fiercely attacked Tull in the final two volumes of his own monthly publication, &quot;The Practical Husbandman and Planter&quot;, in 1734. He not only accused Tull of plagiarizing his technological inventions from others, namely the horse hoe and drill, but also attacked him for his criticism of farming techniques found in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot; and his rejection of traditional, &quot;Virgilian&quot; husbandry.

Throughout the 18th century, &quot;Georgics&quot;, a didactic poem written by the Roman poet Virgil in 37–30 BC, continued to hold great philosophical and cultural power in Britain, serving not merely as poetry but as manuals of husbandry and even scientific treatises. The sheer number of English translations and editions of &quot;Georgics&quot; between 1690 and 1820 highlights its cultural significance in British society. In the preface to his translation, William Benson declares his certainty that &quot;the Husbandry of England in General is Virgilian.&quot; In a polemic chapter entitled &quot;Remarks on the Bad Husbandry, that is so finely Express&#x27;d in Virgil&#x27;s First Georgic,&quot; Tull derides it for several apparent deficiencies in farming techniques:
*Shallow and late ploughing of poor land: Tull disagrees vehemently, as hoeing to enrich the soil is at the crux of his &quot;New Husbandry&quot;, and encourages frequent and early ploughing. Lacking modern scientific understanding of soil nutrition, he incorrectly imagined that the act of dividing soil into smaller and smaller particles through pulverization was what gave nutrition to vegetable roots. Thus he promoted the enrichment of soil by frequent ploughing, which he reasoned would also encourage absorption of dew moisture in the land.
*Burning of stubble to enrich land: Tull derides Virgil&#x27;s &quot;unbecoming&quot; foolishness for suggesting such a faulty method. Tull cites measurements of soil weight before and after stubble burning, noting that the decrease in soil weight must indicate loss of soil content and nutrition.
*Tilling of land with harrows and cross-ploughing: again Tull scoffs at a method of ploughing which diverged from his own.
He concludes with a declaration that his &quot;New Husbandry,&quot; at odds with many of his contemporaries and differing &quot;in all respects, warrants [him] calling it Anti-Virgilian.&quot;

Tull&#x27;s attack was not without consequences. Switzer leapt to Virgil&#x27;s defence against what he saw as groundless and polemic attacks from Tull. He took offence at Tull&#x27;s rejection not only of Virgil, but of any and all who practised husbandry in his style. Switzer criticized Tull for prescribing heavy ploughing to all regardless of soil type and condition, and for his dogmatic dismissal of the value of dung. He compared Tull to a quack who claims one medicine can cure all manners of diseases. For two more volumes, Switzer fine-combs through &quot;The Horse-Hoeing Husbandry&quot;, mining Virgil for authoritative statements on agriculture and pouncing on apparently erroneous claims. Tull&#x27;s rejection of a traditional mode of agronomy in favour of self-experimentation, and Switzer&#x27;s defence of classical authority marked the beginnings of an intellectual discussion around the field of agricultural science.

<text>The Serer-Ndut or Ndut also spelt (&quot;Ndoute&quot; or &quot;N&#x27;doute&quot;) are an ethnic group in Senegal numbering 38600.
They are part of the Serer people who collectively make up the third largest ethnic group in Senegal. The Serer-Ndut live mostly in western Senegal in the district of Mont-Roland, northwest of the city of Thiès.

==Culture==

Their language Ndut, is one of the Cangin languages, closely related to Palor. Like the other Cangin languages, the speakers are ethnically Serers but they do not speak the Serer-Sine language. 
Their language is not a dialect of Serer-Sine (or Serer proper). The people are agriculturalists and lake fishermen.

== Religion ==

Serer-Ndut people traditionally and still practice the Serer religion which involves honouring the ancestors covering all dimensions of life, death, cosmology etc. Their name for the Supreme Deity (Roog - in Serer religion) is Kopé Tiatie Cac - (&quot;God the grandfather&quot; in the Ndut language). The Ndut initiation rite, a rite of passage in Serer religion takes its name from the Ndut language. Some Serer-Ndut are Catholic. The main Catholic mission is at the town of Tiin.

== History ==
The Serer people to which they are a sub-group of are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia along with the Jola people. Their ancestors were dispersed throughout the Senegambia Region and it is suggested that they built the Senegambian stone circles although other sources suggest it was probably the Jola.

The Ndut were also the original founders of Biffeche as well as the Mt Rolland. During the colonial period of Senegal, both the French administration and the Muslim communities of Senegal tried to annihilate the Serer-Ndut people. They failed to achieve their objectives.

<doc id="100778" wikidata="Q1809145" url="?curid=100778" title="Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras">
<text>The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras or Sydney Mardi Gras is an event in Sydney, New South Wales attended by hundreds of thousands of people from around Australia and overseas. One of the largest LGBT festivals in the world, Mardi Gras is the largest Pride event in Oceania. It includes a variety of events such as the Sydney Mardi Gras Parade and Party, Bondi Beach Drag Races, Harbour Party, the academic discussion panel &quot;Queer Thinking&quot;, Mardi Gras Film Festival, as well as Fair Day, which attracts 70,000 people to Victoria Park, Sydney.

The Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras is one of Australia&#x27;s biggest tourist drawcards, with the parade and dance party attracting many international and domestic tourists. It is New South Wales&#x27; second-largest annual event in terms of economic impact, generating an annual income of about 30 million for the state.

The event grew from gay rights parades held annually since 1978, when numerous participants had been arrested by New South Wales Police Force. The Mardi Gras Parade maintains a political flavour, with many marching groups and floats promoting LGBTQIA+ rights issues or themes. Reflecting changes since the first Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras, participants in the Mardi Gras Parade now include groups of uniformed Australian Defence Force personnel, police officers from New South Wales Police Force, as well as interstate and federal police officers, firefighters and other emergency services personnel from the Australian LGBTQIA+ communities. Marriage equality was a dominant theme in the 2011 Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade with at least 15 floats lobbying for same-sex marriage.

In 2019 Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras submitted a bid to host WorldPride 2023 competing against Montreal, Canada and Houston, Texas. InterPride chose Sydney, Australia to host WorldPride 2023 at their Athens October 2019 Annual General Meeting of three hundred delegate organizations, the first time WorldPride was held in the Southern Hemisphere or Asia Pacific region.

==History==
===The term &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;===
The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras or Sydney Mardi Gras is a celebration of LGBTQIA+ history and culture.

The term &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; derives from the celebration on &quot;Mardi&quot; (French for &quot;Tuesday&quot;) when &quot;Gras&quot; (French for &quot;fat&quot;) is eaten prior to the Christian abstinence period of Lent preceding Easter.

===1970s===
On 24 June 1978 at 10 pm as a night-time celebration following a morning protest march and commemoration of the Stonewall riots organised by the Gay Solidarity Group more than 500 people gathered on Oxford Street, in a planned street &quot;festival&quot; calling for an end to discrimination against homosexuals in employment and housing, an end to police harassment and the repeal of all anti-homosexual laws. The figure rose to around 2,000 as revellers out for the Saturday night at Oxford Street bars and clubs responded to the call &quot;Out of the bars and into the streets!&quot;. Although the organisers had obtained permission, this was revoked, and the parade was broken up by the police. After the parade was dispersing in Kings Cross, 53 of the participants were arrested. Although most charges were eventually dropped, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; published the names of those arrested in full, leading to many people being outed to their friends and places of employment, and many of those arrested lost their jobs as homosexuality was a crime in New South Wales (NSW) until 1984. Only two people who were arrested were fined. The rest were released without bail and the charges dismissed. The police response to a legal, local minority protest transformed it into a nationally significant event which stimulated gay rights and law reform campaigns. A documentary, &quot;Witches and Faggots, Dykes and Poofters,&quot; produced by Digby Duncan in 1980 tells the story of the first Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

The second Mardi Gras Parade occurred in 1979 despite opposition by gay media, businesses and groups. The 1979 parade, in recognition of the Stonewall Riots and commemorating the riot of the previous year, was attended by 3,000 people. In that same year, the Labor Government of New South Wales, led by Neville Wran, repealed the under which the arrests in 1978 were made. The second Mardi Gras had the theme of &quot;Power in the Darkness&quot;. While there was a large police presence, there were no arrests made.
===1980 to 1999===

In 1980, after the third successful Mardi Gras parade, at community consultations, decisions were made to move the parade to the summer. In 1981, the parade was shifted to February, with the name changed to the &quot;Sydney Gay Mardi Gras&quot;. An increasingly large number of people not only participated in the now summertime event, but a crowd of 5,000 came to watch it. 1981&#x27;s event saw a split develop between lesbian and gays over the inclusion of floats representing businesses. For most of the decade many lesbians excluded themselves from the event. A large post-parade party was held in 1982, which 4,000 people attended. This would continue to become an integral part of the Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras. 1983 saw 44 floats participate with 20,000 onlookers. Footage of the 1984 event appeared in the music video for the Cold Chisel song &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. In 1987, an estimated 100,000 people came to watch the parade. The mid-1980s saw considerable pressure placed to the Mardi Gras Committee following media controversy regarding AIDS. Despite calls for the parade and the party to be banned, the 1985 parade went ahead with the theme &quot;Fighting for Our Lives&quot;. In 1988 the parade was renamed the &quot;Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras&quot; at an Extraordinary General Meeting.

1991 saw the eighth annual Sydney Gay and Lesbian Film festival, a Mardi Gras event, included in a national film festival for the first time. In this year the parade had become the largest ever held in Australia. In 1992, the festival lasted for four weeks, making it the largest gay and lesbian festival in the world. Also in 1992, Fiona Cunningham-Reid filmed a documentary about the history of the Mardi Gras called &quot;Feed Them to the Cannibals!&quot;. By 1993, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade had become the largest night time outdoor parade in the world. Mardi Gras&#x27; Economic Impact Study found that the total Mardi Gras impact into the Australian economy was around A$38 million. In February 1993 an Umbrella Event of the festival was the play &quot;Nothing Personal&quot; designed by Arthur Dicks. In 1994, Mardi Gras Festival adopted the theme &quot;We are Family&quot;, a nod to it being International Year of the Family. That year there were 137 floats in the parade with 600,000 spectators. For the first time, the parade was filmed by the ABC TV and shown on Sunday 6 March at 8.30 pm. It won its time slot and earned ABC TV its highest ratings in history. The 1997 parade was covered by Libbi Gorr&#x27;s current affairs show &quot;McFeast&quot; on ABC TV.

In 1988, Aboriginal Australian dancers Malcolm Cole (1949-1995) and Rodney Junga-Williams (1962-2011), in collaboration with artist Panos Couros, enacted the story of the First Fleet, with Cole as Captain Cook, and Junga-Williams as Joseph Banks – the first ever Aboriginal float entry in the parade. A boatful of black sailors was pulled by a white man, with this leading float commemorating 218 years after Cook&#x27;s landing and claim on the land. Cole died of HIV/AIDS, and in 2024 his twin brother Robert recreated his costume in order to march again in the parade to commemorate his life.

Criticism of the Sydney Mardi Gras was perhaps at its strongest during the early years of the AIDS crisis, and flared again when in 1994 the national broadcaster ABC telecast the parade for the first time.

In 1996 there was criticism over the inclusion of bisexuals and heterosexuals as members of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. It was claimed that the subsequent requirement for those people to correctly answer specific questions, created two classes of membership – namely (1) gays, lesbians and transgender people and (2) bisexuals and heterosexuals.

In 1997 a small group of people who were part of the 1978 events contributed to planning the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Mardi Gras parade in 1998. This group became known as the 78ers and has led each year&#x27;s Mardi Gras parade since 1998.

===2000 to 2009===

The 2001 Parade was broadcast on Network Ten and had a theme of gay and lesbian parenting. The 2002 event saw a loss of A$400,000. In August the organising company was bankrupt. In 2003, the festival organisers responded to claims that the event was becoming too commercialised by implementing a scaled-down, grassroots approach. The 2009 performance figures indicated about 9,500 participants and 134 floats were part of the parade, making it the largest ever. Up to 300,000 spectators from Australia and overseas turned out in 2011 for the celebrations.

Mardi Gras, at different times, has attracted criticism from its own members, LGBTQIA+ communities, and a variety of religious and political groups. Some argue Mardi Gras is inherently subversive to traditional Christian, Islamic and Jewish values. Each year the event is held, Fred Nile, a former member of the New South Wales Legislative Council and a former minister of the Uniting Church in Australia, leads a prayer for rain on the event.

In January 2008 Robert Forsyth, the Anglican bishop of South Sydney, condemned &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; for opening the Mardi Gras because it depicted Judas seducing a gay Jesus as well as Jesus&#x27; administration of gay marriage between two apostles. Director Leigh Rowney accepted that it would generate discussion on Homosexuality and Christianity and stated: &quot;I wanted this play in the hands of a Christian person like myself to give it dignity but still open it up to answering questions about Christianity as a faith system.&quot; Playwright Terrence McNally, a gay man, received death threats when it was played in the United States.

===2010 to 2015 ===

In early 2011, members of the organisation unanimously voted to include intersex formally into the organisation at the Annual General Meeting and adopt the formal use of the LGBTQIA+ acronym. To allow for greater inclusion of the LGBTQIA+ community it represents (including those identifying as bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual), on 17 November 2011 the festival and event organisers changed the event name to &quot;Sydney Mardi Gras&quot;. On the same date the organisation reverted to its former name, &quot;Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras&quot; (from &quot;New Mardi Gras&quot;), as more than 9,100 participants joined in the 2012 Parade, on 134 floats.

In 2011 Mardi Gras came under fire from LGBTQIA+ communities for removing the words &quot;Gay and Lesbian&quot; from the festival&#x27;s name. The organisation&#x27;s board confessed that they did not adequately consult the community in such an important decision. The organisation was also criticised for focusing on the requests of corporate sponsors, and allowing their floats rather than maintaining its original sense of identity. This followed the 2010 season in which the Mardi Gras Parade and Party were held on separate dates for the first time in history.

During the rebranding in 2011, Mardi Gras Chairman Peter Urmson said &quot;I think that whilst we are first and foremost a GLBTQI community organisation, we also are very open to all of our friends that do not necessarily identify within that alphabet soup.&quot; Many community members were offended by the change, including former Mardi Gras president Richard Cobden, who said that the group did not have the authority to make such a change, adding &quot;For 20-plus years we have been able to force the mainstream media to call it the &#x27;Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.&#x27; They had to say the words. For a long time they did not want to but we made them. That has been thrown away&quot;.

The name of the festival was subsequently restored as the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

In 2013, the New South Wales Police were accused of police brutality after a video shot by a bystander and uploaded to YouTube showed a handcuffed man thrown to the ground twice by an officer. The man repeatedly kicked police officers before being handcuffed. By 2014, all charges against the bystander were withdrawn by police and the officer concerned was facing disciplinary proceedings. Disciplinary proceedings against the officer were withdrawn.

On a number of occasions, there have been controversies with, and bans of, the UFO-related Raelians participation in the parade. A Raelian spokesman said the bans were unfair as the Raelians support non-discrimination and have gay and lesbian members.

In 2012 Mardi Gras organisers faced the issue of having a Sydney Polyamorists float in the parade, whilst also promoting same-sex marriage for couples. Particularly, as the 2012 Mardi Gras theme was &quot;universal and infinite love&quot;, some polyamorists felt discriminated against. The issue was resolved with a polyamory float, based on the theme, &quot;Queer Polyamory&quot;. In the 2014 Mardi Gras there was another float, &quot;Polyamory Sydney &#x27;Birds of a Feather, love together&#x27; – the infinite love Nest&quot;.

In 2015, some members of the LGBTIQ community argued that the Mardi Gras perpetuates gay stereotypes and excludes other members of the LGBTIQ community.

===2020s===
In 2020, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras was held just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. NSW Health advised there was no evidence of community transmission of the virus at that time. British singer Dua Lipa debuted her single Physical at the event.

In 2021, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the parade, held on 6 March 2021, was relocated to the nearby Sydney Cricket Ground as a paid, ticketed event with 36,000 spectators and was televised live on the Special Broadcasting Service.

In 2023, independent senator for Victoria Lidia Thorpe disrupted the parade in an attempt to raise awareness about intractable social issues such as Indigenous rates of incarceration and the role of police in that process.

In 2024, after the alleged murder of Jesse Baird and his partner Luke Davies around 20 February 2024 by serving NSW Police officer Beau Lamarre, the Mardi Gras board decided to ban members of the force from participating in Mardi Gras. Owing to sensitivities in the LGBTQIA+ community and recollections of past poor treatment by NSW Police. However this decision was reversed on 28 February 2024, and it was agreed by both the board and Police Commissioner Karen Webb that the Force could participate, but not in uniform. They would march as a group, without a float.

Additionally in 2024, Malcolm Cole&#x27;s twin brother Robert recreated his 1988 Captain Cook costume, in order to wear it in the parade to commemorate Malcolm&#x27;s life.

==Events==
===Mardi Gras Parade===
The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras festival culminates in the renowned Sydney Mardi Gras Parade, an LGBTQIA+ rights protest and celebration of sexuality. The parade features more than 12,500 entrants in colourful costumes and elaborate floats, who represent a community group, topical theme or political message. Parade entrants include members of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, the Australian Defence Force, Amnesty International Australia, Australian Marriage Equality, City of Sydney, Fire &amp; Rescue New South Wales, Taronga Conservation Society and DNA among many others.

Each parade starts with approximately 200 Dykes on Bikes riding up Oxford Street. It is often accompanied by fireworks displays, which are launched from the rooftops of buildings along the parade route. Approximately 300,000 spectators watch the Parade as it snakes from the Sydney central business district to Darlinghurst.

The parade travels along Oxford Street before turning into Flinders Street and finally into the bus lane that runs parallel to Anzac Parade – to the parade end. These roads and others including some around Hyde Park, are closed to traffic for the duration of the parade and for a few hours after as clean-up operations proceed.

Each year, a Chief of Parade (Grand Marshal), is chosen by the organisation New Mardi Gras as someone who represents the values and spirit of Mardi Gras. This honourable title has previously been awarded to:
* 2004 – Monica Hingston, former nun and cousin of Cardinal George Pell
* 2007 – Rupert Everett, gay actor
* 2008 – Margaret Cho, bisexual American comedian
* 2009 – Matthew Mitcham, Australian Olympic gold-medalist, world record holder and 2008 Australian Sports Performer of the Year
* 2010 – Amanda Lepore, transgender model/performer
* 2011 – Instead of a single Chief of Parade leading the march, eight high-profile heroes were chosen to lead the Parade. These were Lily Tomlin, lesbian actress and comedian; Peter Tatchell, a world-renowned gay rights campaigner; Don Baxter, Executive Director of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations at that time; Bev Lange, chief executive officer of the Bobby Goldsmith Foundation at the time, a former President of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, and a former co-chair of the Sydney Gay Games; Lex Watson and Sue Wills, Campaign Against Moral Prosecution&#x27;s (CAMP) first Co-Presidents; and Hannah Williams and Savannah Supski, who had recently protested against the ban against same-sex couples at Hannah&#x27;s Melbourne school formal. The same year, Ignatius Jones consulted as Artistic Director to oversee the creative production of the Parade.
* 2012 – Shelley Argent, the national spokesperson for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays and 2011 Queensland Senior Australian of the Year

The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade is extensively covered by the media. In 2011, it was broadcast on radio by Joy 94.9 FM Melbourne and 2SER 107.3 FM Sydney. The Parade was also shown live on Foxtel&#x27;s Arena in its entirety. The Arena broadcast was presented by hosts Louie Spence of Pineapple Dance Studios, Charlotte Dawson, Ruby Rose and Matthew Mitcham. The Parade was also broadcast on radio live by various community radio stations, via the CBAA&#x27;s Community Radio Network satellite. In 2012, Optus, a corporate sponsor, broadcast a delayed and edited highlights of the parade via www.mardigrastv.org.au. In 2014, SBS TV broadcast delayed and edited coverage of the parade highlights, hosted by Tom Ballard, Patrick Abboud and Heather Peace.

Despite its name, Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is not held on Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday) or indeed, on a Tuesday at all. In recent years, the Mardi Gras Parade has been on the first Saturday of March, with a festival of events going for approximately three weeks preceding it.

The parade running order for 4 March 2017.

===Mardi Gras Party (Post Parade)===
The post parade party is one of the largest ongoing party events in the country. Mardi Gras Party attendances at Sydney&#x27;s Hordern Pavilion / Royal Hall of Industries peaked in 1998 with tickets sold. In the years since to tickets are consistently sold, an increase over the first Parade Ball held in 1980 at the Paddington Town Hall, a BYO event which attracted 700 guests. Although, by the late first decade of the 21st century, ticket sales has begun to fall, with the 2012 post parade party selling out at tickets; and ticket sales a little lower again in 2013.

The 2010 party was not held on the night of the parade and was later described by the organisers as human error during scheduling.

===Mardi Gras Festival===
By 1987 the festival included 35 events. The 1998 festival was estimated to contribute $99 million to the Sydney economy.

Multi-disc Mardi Gras compilation albums were released in 1995, 1997, 2002 and 2003.

The festival&#x27;s live entertainment includes cabaret, comedy, music and theatre. The Mardi Gras Film Festival showcases international and local gay and lesbian films. There are many literature and arts events, forum and conferences to attend between the many social activities. Individual and team sports have always been a big part of the festival.

===Mardi Gras Fair Day===
In 1979 an &#x27;Alternative Lifestyle Fair&#x27; as part of a week of activities around International Gay Solidarity Day. During the early 1980s the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Business Association held an annual Fair Day, which was brought into the Sydney Gay Mardi Gras program in 1985. From 1985 to 1988 the Business Association continued to run the Fair, which was subsequently run by the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras from 1989. The event is the kick off event for the official Mardi Gras season in Victoria Park, Sydney for Sydney&#x27;s wider LGBTQIA+ communities and their friends and family. Up to 70,000 people routinely turn out to sit on the grass, browse the stalls and catch up with old friends or make some new ones. Fair Day 2011 saw record numbers of attendees. Entertainment came from the Foxtel Main Stage and included a set from Zoe Badwi and Garçon Garçon, and one of the biggest ever &quot;Mr and Mrs Fair Day&quot; competitions. Approximately 250 volunteers assisted with 220 stalls made up of many LGBTQIA+community groups.

In 2017, Mardi Gras Fair Day was held at Camperdown Memorial Rest Park on Sunday 19 February.

===Mardi Gras Awards===

The Mardi Gras Awards are presented to organisations and individuals who made an outstanding contribution to Mardi Gras and the gay and lesbian community.

== WorldPride Sydney 2023 ==
InterPride, at their October 2019 Annual General Meeting of three hundred delegate organizations, held in Athens, Greece chose Sydney, Australia to host WorldPride 2023, the first time WorldPride will be held in the Southern Hemisphere or Asia Pacific region. Sydney received 60% of the vote ahead of the other bid contenders Montreal, Canada (36%) and Houston, Texas (3%).

WorldPride 2023 coincided with the 50th Anniversary of the first Australian Gay Pride Week, 45th Anniversary of the first Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras and 5th Anniversary of Marriage Equality in Australia. According to the bid document the stated objective of WorldPride Sydney 2023 is to celebrate the diversity of culture and identity in the Asia Pacific region, while shining a light on widespread human rights abuses.

WorldPride Sydney 2023 was held between 16 February and 4 March during Australia&#x27;s summer and consisted of a 17-day combined 45th Anniversary Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras/WorldPride 2023 Festival. The centrepiece was a three-day LGBTQIA+ Human Rights and Health Conference focusing on LGBTQIA+ people&#x27;s experiences of violence, torture, abuse, discrimination and persecution in the Asia Pacific region and more broadly.

==Support==
Political support has come from a number of local and federal politicians such as former Australian Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja and current Labor Senator Penny Wong, Members of the House of Representatives Tanya Plibersek and current Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, former Leader of the Opposition and Labor Party Bill Shorten Former Premier Barry O&#x27;Farrell as well as the present Lord Mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore. In 2023 Albanese became the first Prime Minister to march in Mardi Gras while in office. In 2024 Chris Minns became the first Premier of New South Wales to march in Mardi Gras.

As Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull attended the 2016 Mardi Gras but did not march. There was a movement by some Mardi Gras members to disinvite him in 2017 due to &quot;lack of action&quot; on same-sex marriage and his cuts to the Safe Schools program however the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras board subsequently rejected the move.

Hundreds of thousands of Australians and international guests come out in support of the Parade, with many lining up for a viewing spot from early in the afternoon. By the 7.45 pm Parade kick-off, crowds are usually ten-people deep. Though it has rained on several Mardi Gras parades (notably with heavy downpours prior to, and drizzle during, the parade in 1995, and heavy rainfall during the parade in 2004), this has never stopped the parade.

The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is regarded internationally as one of the world&#x27;s biggest and best LGBTQI marches and festivals, and has been described as an &quot;absolute once-in-a-lifetime must for every travelling gay man&quot;. Mardi Gras is featured in the programmes of tour operators which target the gay market.

In the 2000s the Mardi Gras organisation struck financial trouble, and collapsed. This was attributed at the time to poor financial management and a downturn in international tourism following the attack on the World Trade Center in New York City, while another explanation was given as Australia&#x27;s ongoing public liability crisis, which has seen massive insurance premiums impose a significant burden on community and public events, if not preventing them. As a consequence of the impending collapse of the organisation, there was a groundswell of concern and support within Sydney&#x27;s LGBTQI communities for the continuation of the work and events of Mardi Gras. A series of crisis meetings culminated in the creation of a reformed organisation &quot;New Mardi Gras&quot; being formed to continue the Parade, the Festival &amp; the Party.

In 2008, it was announced that the Government of New South Wales would provide funding for Mardi Gras as it had become part of the state&#x27;s Master Events Calendar. Limited funds have also been sourced from the Sleaze Ball party held in Sydney towards the end of the year. Mardi Gras still receives significant public support and the event now receives some limited government funding.

In 2013, a temporary rainbow crossing was created by City of Sydney Council as part of the 35th anniversary celebrations. The rainbow crossing proved popular with tourists and when it was removed as part of a condition with Roads &amp; Maritime Services when the rainbow crossing was built, DIY rainbow crossings, emerged and was picked up by the local and international media. In 2018 the rainbow crossing was reinstated.

<text>The Cangin () languages are spoken by 200,000 people (as of 2007) in a small area east of Dakar, Senegal. They are the languages spoken by the Serer people who do not speak the Serer language (&quot;Serer-Sine&quot;). Because the people are ethnically Serer, the Cangin languages are commonly thought to be dialects of the Serer language. However, they are not closely related; Serer is closer to Fulani than it is to Cangin.

==Languages==
The Cangin languages are:

Lehar and Noon are particularly close, as are Ndut and Palor, though not quite to the point of easy intelligibility. Safen is transparently closer to Lehar–Noon than to Palor–Ndut.

<doc id="100780" wikidata="Q845515" url="?curid=100780" title="Transatlantic (band)">
<text>Transatlantic were a multinational progressive rock supergroup consisting of Neal Morse (ex–Spock&#x27;s Beard), Roine Stolt (Kaipa, the Flower Kings), Pete Trewavas (Marillion, Edison&#x27;s Children) and Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater). They formed in 1999 as a side project to their full-time bands, but disbanded in 2002. They then reunited in 2009, and then disbanded again in 2022. 

Despite not being an official member and only appearing on one studio album, Daniel Gildenlöw (Pain of Salvation) has often joined the band during live shows. However, due to illness, Ted Leonard stood in for him during the 2014 tour. Leonard also joined the band during the 2022 tour.

==Biography==
===Formation===
Originally intending to include Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos, Morse and Portnoy tapped Flower Kings guitarist/vocalist Roine Stolt when Matheos was unable to participate. The band completed their lineup by adding bassist and progressive rock veteran Pete Trewavas from the group Marillion and Edison&#x27;s Children. Before Transatlantic, the first moniker the band came up with was &quot;Second Nature&quot;.

===&quot;SMPT:e&quot; and &quot;Bridge Across Forever&quot; (2000–2002)===
Their first album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (a play on words, as both a combination of the members&#x27; last initials, as well as a common machine time protocol used in high end recording studios) received strong critical reviews, including &quot;some of the best progressive rock music ever written&quot; (Robert Taylor in AllMusic).

A subsequent tour of the United States led to a double live CD, &quot;Transatlantic Live in America&quot;, and a video of the same name. The band showed their musical heritage on the live CD, presenting covers of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, as well as a medley of Genesis&#x27; epic &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; and &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;. The band also released another double live CD/DVD called &quot;Live in Europe&quot; in 2003; one standout is the version of &quot;Suite Charlotte Pike&quot; that includes covers of tracks from The Beatles &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album.

Though &quot;SMPT:e&quot; contained the 31-minute opus &quot;All of the Above&quot;, the band&#x27;s second studio album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Bridge Across Forever&quot;, found the band flexing their muscles further in the long form for which progressive rock is known. The CD contained just four tracks, the 26-minute &quot;Duel With the Devil&quot;, the 14-minute &quot;Suite Charlotte Pike&quot;, and the 26-minute &quot;Stranger in Your Soul&quot; making up the bulk of the disc, with the title track coming in at a relatively scant five minutes. The limited edition also contains a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot;. In November 2001, the band toured Europe. As an added bonus for progressive metal fans, Daniel Gildenlöw of the band Pain of Salvation sat in throughout the tour, playing keyboards, guitars, percussion, and vocals.

===Years of hiatus (2002–2009)===
Morse left his regular band Spock&#x27;s Beard in October 2002, stating &quot;God wants me to do something else,&quot; which meant leaving the mainstream prog scene to launch a new career as a Christian musician. This move also included ending his activities for Transatlantic. Portnoy reacted: &quot;This spells the end of Transatlantic as I wouldn&#x27;t possibly consider continuing it without him.&quot; A live DVD of the tour was released in late 2003.

In the years to follow Morse continued to collaborate with Portnoy both in the studio and on stage. Morse&#x27; concerts frequently included one or more Transatlantic songs. A three-quarter reunion took place on 23 August 2008, when Stolt and Portnoy joined Morse at the Three Rivers Prog Fest in Pittsburgh for &quot;We All Need Some Light&quot; and &quot;Stranger in Your Soul&quot;.

===Reunion and &quot;The Whirlwind&quot; (2009–2013)===
On 16 April 2009, it was officially announced that the band had reunited and begun work on a third studio album. The album was released in October 2009 and consisted of a single 77-minute title-track &quot;The Whirlwind&quot;. A special edition of the album was also released, including a second disc with four additional original tracks and four cover tracks. Additionally, a deluxe edition was released, which included a DVD documenting the making of the album. The album reached No. 21 on the U.S. Billboard Heatseekers chart.

The band toured North America and Europe in April–May 2010 in support of &quot;The Whirlwind&quot;. Dubbed the Whirld Tour, the band was again joined by Daniel Gildenlöw on stage.

In February 2013, the new Neal Morse band (with Mike Portnoy) and the Flower Kings started a European tour together which was followed by a gig in Los Angeles in May. Each band performed a set with their own songs and the encore set featured Transatlantic songs performed by Morse, Portnoy and Stolt supported by members of the two bands with special guests Jonas Reingold and Randy George alternating on bass. The encore ends with eleven musicians on the stage.

On 10 March 2013, Pete Trewavas announced at the Marillion Weekend Convention in Port Zélande, the Netherlands, that he would be going to Nashville in the Summer to record new material with Transatlantic. Neal Morse confirmed this to DPRP.

===&quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (2014)===
On 30 May 2013, Mike Portnoy announced that they had finished writing a new Transatlantic album. It featured five songs (two epics and three &#x27;normal length&#x27; ones) plus eight covers for the bonus disc. The album was released in January 2014. A world tour of the United States and Europe followed, including a performance on the &quot;Progressive Nation at Sea&quot; cruise created by Mike Portnoy. The band played two shows, with the first featuring the entire &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; album and the second including guest performances by famous progressive rock artists such as Jon Anderson of Yes. On 11 September 2014, Kaleidoscope won Album of the Year at the third annual Progressive Music Awards.

===&quot;The Absolute Universe&quot; (2019–2022)===
Transatlantic recorded its fifth album, &quot;The Absolute Universe&quot;, and released it on 5 February 2021.

On 5 June 2021, Mike Portnoy announced on his Twitter feed that Transatlantic would be playing at Morsefest 2022 outside of Nashville, TN on 29–30 April 2022 as a warmup gig for Cruise To The Edge. It was subsequently announced that both &quot;The Absolute Universe&quot; and &quot;The Whirlwind&quot; would be played in their entirety at these shows.

<doc id="100782" wikidata="Q7959671" url="?curid=100782" title="Wagonway">
<text>Wagonways (also spelt Waggonways), also known as horse-drawn railways and horse-drawn railroad consisted of the horses, equipment and tracks used for hauling wagons, which preceded steam-powered railways. The terms plateway, tramway, dramway, were used. The advantage of wagonways was that far bigger loads could be transported with the same power.

== Ancient systems ==

The earliest evidence is of the long &quot;Diolkos&quot; paved trackway, which transported boats across the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece from around 600 BC. Wheeled vehicles pulled by men and animals ran in grooves in limestone, which provided the track element, preventing the wagons from leaving the intended route. The Diolkos was in use for over 650 years, until at least the 1st century AD. Paved trackways were later built in Roman Egypt.

== Wooden rails ==
Such an operation was illustrated in Germany in 1556 by Georgius Agricola (image left) in his work De re metallica. This line used &quot;Hund&quot; carts with unflanged wheels running on wooden planks and a vertical pin on the truck fitting into the gap between the planks to keep it going the right way. The miners called the wagons &quot;Hunde&quot; (&quot;dogs&quot;) from the noise they made on the tracks.
Around 1568, German miners working in the Mines Royal near Keswick used such a system. Archaeological work at the Mines Royal site at Caldbeck in the English Lake District confirmed the use of &quot;hunds&quot;.

In 1604, Huntingdon Beaumont completed the Wollaton Wagonway, built to transport coal from the mines at Strelley to Wollaton Lane End, just west of Nottingham, England. Wagonways have been discovered between Broseley and Jackfield in Shropshire from 1605, used by James Clifford to transport coal from his mines in Broseley to the Severn River. It has been suggested that these are somewhat older than that at Wollaton.

The Middleton Railway in Leeds, which was built in 1758 as a wagonway, later became the world&#x27;s first operational railway (other than funiculars), albeit in an upgraded form. In 1764, the first railway in America was built in Lewiston, New York as a wagonway.

Wagonways improved coal transport by allowing one horse to deliver between of coal per run an approximate fourfold increase. Wagonways were usually designed to carry the fully loaded wagons downhill to a canal or boat dock and then return the empty wagons back to the mine.

== Metal rails ==

Until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, rails were made of wood, were a few inches wide and were fastened end to end, on logs of wood or &quot;sleepers&quot;, placed crosswise at intervals of two or three feet. In time, it became common to cover them with a thin flat sheathing or &quot;plating&quot; of iron, in order to add to their life and reduce friction. This caused more wear on the wooden rollers of the wagons and towards the middle of the 18th century, led to the introduction of iron wheels. However, the iron sheathing was not strong enough to resist buckling under the passage of the loaded wagons, so rails made wholly of iron were invented.
In 1760, the Coalbrookdale Iron Works began to reinforce their wooden-railed tramway with iron bars, which were found to facilitate passage and diminish expenses. As a result, in 1767, they began to make cast iron rails. These were probably long, with four projecting ears or lugs by to enable them to be fixed to the sleepers. The rails were wide and thick. Later, descriptions also refer to rails long and only wide.

=== Plateways, flangeways ===
A later system involved L-shaped iron rails or plates, each long and wide, having on the inner side an upright ledge or flange, high at the centre and tapering to at the ends, for the purpose of keeping the flat wheels on the track. Subsequently, to increase strength, a similar flange might be added below the rail. Wooden sleepers continued to be usedthe rails were secured by spikes passing through the extremitiesbut, circa 1793, stone blocks began to be used, an innovation associated with Benjamin Outram, although he was not the originator. This type of rail was known as the plate-rail, tramway-plate or way-plate, names that are preserved in the modern term &quot;platelayer&quot; applied to the workers who lay and maintain the permanent way. The wheels of flangeway wagons were plain, but they could not operate on ordinary roads as the narrow rims would dig into the surface.

=== Edgeways ===

Another form of rail, the edge rail, was first used by William Jessop on a line that was opened as part of the Charnwood Forest Canal between Loughborough and Nanpantan in Leicestershire in 1789. This line was originally designed as a plateway on the Outram system, but objections were raised to laying rails with upstanding ledges or flanges on the turnpike. This difficulty was overcome by paving or &quot;causewaying&quot; the road up to the level of the top of the flanges. In 1790, Jessop and his partner Outram began to manufacture edge-rails. Another example of the edge rail application was the Lake Lock Rail Road in the West Riding of Yorkshire (now West Yorkshire) used primarily for coal transport. The railway charged a toll and opened for traffic in 1798, making it the world&#x27;s oldest public railway. The route started at Lake Lock, Stanley, on the Aire &amp; Calder Navigation, running from Wakefield to Outwood, a distance of approximately . Edge-rails (with a side rack) were used on the nearby Middleton-Leeds rack railway (a length of this rail is on display in Leeds City Museum). The wheels of an edgeway have flanges, like modern railways and tramways. Causewaying is also done on modern level crossings and tramways.

These two systems of constructing iron railways continued to exist until the early 19th century. In most parts of England the plate-rail was preferred. Plate-rails were used on the Surrey Iron Railway (SIR), from Wandsworth to West Croydon. The SIR was sanctioned by Parliament in 1801 and finished in 1803. Like the Lake Lock Rail Road, the SIR was available to the public on payment of tolls; previous lines had all been private and reserved exclusively for the use of their owners. Since it was used by individual operators, vehicles would vary greatly in wheel spacing (gauge) and the plate rail coped better. In South Wales again, where in 1811 the railways were connected with canals, collieries, ironworks, and copper works, and had a total length of nearly , the plateway was almost universal. But in the North of England and in Scotland the edge-rail was held in greater favor, and soon its superiority was generally established. Wheels tended to bind against the flange of the plate rail and mud and stones would build up.
The manufacture of the rails themselves was gradually improved. By making them in longer lengths, the number of joints per mile was reduced. Joints were always the weakest part of the line. Another advance was the substitution of wrought iron for cast iron, though that material did not gain wide adoption until after the patent for an improved method of rolling rails was granted in 1820 to John Birkinshaw, of the Bedlington Ironworks. His rails were wedge-shaped in section, much wider at the top than at the bottom, with the intermediate portion or web thinner still. He recommended that they be made long, suggesting that several might be welded together end to end to form considerable lengths. They were supported on sleepers by chairs at intervals of , and were fish-bellied between the support points. As used by George Stephenson on the Stockton &amp; Darlington, and Canterbury &amp; Whitstable lines, they weighed . On the Liverpool and Manchester Railway they were usually long and weighed and were fastened by iron wedges to chairs weighing each. The chairs were in turn fixed to the sleepers by two iron spikes, half-round wooden cross sleepers employed on embankments and stone blocks square by deep in cuttings. The fish-bellied rails were found to break near the chairs and starting in 1834, they were gradually replaced with parallel rails weighing .

== Steam power ==
In 1804, Richard Trevithick, in the first recorded use of steam power on a railway, ran a high-pressure steam locomotive with smooth wheels on an &#x27;L&#x27; section plateway near Merthyr Tydfil, but it was more expensive than horses. He made three trips from the iron mines at Penydarren to the Merthyr-Cardiff Canal and each time broke the rails that were designed for horse wagon loads. There was general doubt at the time that smooth wheels could obtain traction on smooth rails. This resulted in proposals using rack or other drive mechanisms.
Mr Blenkinsop of Middleton Colliery patented the use of cogged wheels in 1811 and in 1812, the Middleton Railway (edgeway, rack rail) successfully used twin cylinder steam locomotives made by Matthew Murray of Holbeck, Leeds. George Stephenson made his first steam locomotive in 1813 (patented 1815) for the Killingworth colliery, and found smooth wheels on smooth rails provided adequate grip. Although he later recounted that they called this locomotive &#x27;My Lord&#x27; as it was financed by Lord Ravensworth, it seems that it was known at the time as Blücher. In 1814 William Stewart was engaged by Parkend Coal Co in the Forest of Dean for the construction of a steam locomotive, which when trialled was reported to be successful. Stewart did not receive his expected reward and the two parties parted on bad terms. Stewart was &#x27;obliged to abandon the engine to that Company&#x27;. In 1821, a wagonway was proposed to connect the mines at West Durham, Darlington and the River Tees at Stockton, George Stephenson successfully argued that horse-drawn wagonways were obsolete and a steam-powered railway could carry 50 times as much coal. In 1825 he built the locomotive &quot;Locomotion&quot; for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in England&#x27;s northeast, which became the world&#x27;s first public steam railway in 1825, via both horse power and steam power on different runs.

Stationary steam engines for mining were generally available around the middle of the 18th century. Wagonways and steam-powered railways had steep uphill sections and would employ a cable powered by a stationary steam engine to work the inclined sections. British troops in Lewiston, New York used a cable wagonway to move supplies to bases before the American Revolutionary War. The Stockton and Darlington had two inclined sections powered by cable. The transition from a wagonway to a fully steam-powered railway was gradual. Railways up to the 1830s that were steam-powered often made runs with horses when the steam locomotives were unavailable. Even in the steam age, it was convenient to use horses in station yards to shunt wagons from one place to another. Horses do not need lengthy times to raise steam in the boiler, and can take shortcuts from one siding to another. At Hamley Bridge tenders were called for the supply of horses, in part because normal railway staff lacked horse handling skills.

== Pole road ==
Wooden rails continued to be used for temporary railroads into the twentieth century. Some timber harvesting companies in the southeastern United States created pole roads using unmarketable logs, which were effectively free, to create tracks at a cost of between $100 and $500 per mile. Permanence was not an issue, as the lumberjacks moved on to other stands of timber as each area was cleared. At least one such pole road system reportedly extended some .

Typically the pole rails were logs of diameter, laid parallel directly on the ground without cross-ties, and joined end-to-end with lap joints and wooden s. Rolling stock typically had wheels either with concave rims that hugged the top of the pole rails, or un-flanged wheels with separate guide wheels running against the side of each rail. Steam traction engines and some purpose-built locomotives were successfully used for hauling trains of logs. For example, &quot;Perdido&quot; was built by Adams &amp; Price Locomotive and Machinery Works of Nashville, Tennessee in 1885 for the Wallace, Sanford and Company sawmill at Williams Station, Alabama, where it hauled up to seven cars of 3 or 4 logs each. This was a geared engine (4.5 to 1 gear ratio), driving four individually-rotating concave-rim wheels on stationary axles via chain drives; powerful but running less than . Still later, modified semitrailer tractors have been used.

==Decline==

As steam power gradually replaced horse power throughout the 19th century, the term &quot;wagonway&quot; became obsolete and was superseded by the term &quot;railway&quot;. , very few horse or cable freight railways are operating, notable examples being the cable-hauled St Michael&#x27;s Mount Tramway and the Reisszug, which has been in continuous operation since around 1900. A few passenger lines continue to operate, including the horse-hauled Douglas Bay Horse Tramway and the cable-hauled San Francisco cable cars.

<doc id="100783" wikidata="Q963626" url="?curid=100783" title="Paul Shaffer">
<text>Paul Allen Wood Shaffer (born November 28, 1949) is a Canadian singer, keyboardist, composer, actor, author, comedian, and musician who served as David Letterman&#x27;s musical director, band leader, and sidekick on the entire run of both &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; (1982–1993) and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (1993–2015).

==Early years==
Shaffer was born in 1949 in Toronto, and raised in Fort William (now part of Thunder Bay), Ontario, Canada, the son of Shirley and Bernard Shaffer. He was raised in the Jewish faith; his mother volunteered with local charities, and donated to Hadassah Women&#x27;s Zionist Organization of America. His father, a lawyer, was a jazz aficionado while his mother loved show tunes. When Shaffer was 12, his parents took him on a trip to Las Vegas where they took in Nat King Cole and other shows; this was an experience Shaffer described later as &quot;life changing&quot; and led to his decision to become a performer. As a child, Shaffer took piano lessons, and in his teenage years played the organ in a band called Fabulous Fugitives with his schoolmates in Thunder Bay. Later, he performed with the &quot;Flash Landing Band&quot; at different venues around Edmonton and the interior of British Columbia. Educated at the University of Toronto, he began playing with jazz guitarist Tisziji Muñoz, performing in bands around the bars there, where he found an interest in musicals, and completed his studies, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1971.

Shaffer appears briefly, playing an organ at an outdoor wedding, in &quot;North of Superior&quot; (1971), an early IMAX documentary shot in northern Ontario.

==Career==
===&quot;Godspell&quot; to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Shaffer began his music career in 1972 when Stephen Schwartz invited him to be the musical director for the Toronto production of &quot;Godspell&quot;, starring Victor Garber, Gilda Radner, Martin Short, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, and Andrea Martin. He went on to play piano for the Schwartz Broadway show &quot;The Magic Show&quot; in 1974, then became a member of the house band on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) television program from 1975 to 1980 (except for a brief departure in 1977). Though Shaffer was at the piano and appeared to be directing the band&#x27;s actions, Howard Shore was credited as &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s musical director, eventually turning the actual conducting of the band to Howard Johnson. Shaffer also regularly appeared in the show&#x27;s sketches, notably as the pianist for Bill Murray&#x27;s Nick the Lounge Singer character, and as Don Kirshner. He also appeared as a keyboardist on the 1978 album &quot;Desire Wire&quot;, recorded by pop/rock star, musician, and backing vocalist Cindy Bullens.

Shaffer occasionally teamed up with the Not Ready for Prime-Time Players off the show, as well, including work on Gilda Radner&#x27;s highly successful Broadway show and as the musical director for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd whenever they recorded or performed as the Blues Brothers. Shaffer was to appear in the duo&#x27;s 1980 film, but as he revealed in October 2009 on &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot;, Belushi dropped him from the project. In a memo to fellow &quot;SNL&quot; colleagues, Belushi said that he was unhappy that Shaffer was spending so much time on a studio record for Radner. Belushi said that he had tried to talk Shaffer out of working on the album in the first place to avoid sharing Shaffer&#x27;s talents with another &quot;SNL&quot;-related project. Shaffer later reported that he was in (unrequited) love with Radner. He went on to appear in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;.

In 1977, Shaffer played on the Mark &amp; Clark Band&#x27;s hit song &quot;Worn Down Piano&quot;.

Shaffer left &quot;SNL&quot; in 1977 for a few months to co-star with Greg Evigan in &quot;A Year at the Top&quot;, a short-lived CBS sitcom in which Shaffer and Evigan play two musicians from Idaho who relocate to Hollywood, where they are regularly tempted by a famous promoter (who is actually the devil&#x27;s son), played by Gabriel Dell, to sell their souls in exchange for a year of stardom. Though the series only lasted a few episodes, a soundtrack album was released.

Following the series&#x27; cancellation, Shaffer returned to &quot;SNL&quot; during the show&#x27;s third season during the 1977-78 season. He was named a cast member during the 1979-80 season, as a featured player. Making him the first and only band member to join the cast. In the spring of 1980, Shaffer became the first person to say &quot;fuck&quot; on &quot;SNL&quot;. That year, &quot;SNL&quot; parodied &quot;The Troggs Tapes&quot; with a medieval musical sketch featuring Shaffer, Bill Murray, Harry Shearer, and a &quot;special guest appearance&quot; by John Belushi (who had left the show the previous year). In the middle of a long tirade that featured repeated use of the word &quot;flogging&quot;, Shaffer inadvertently uttered the forbidden word. It not only escaped the censors in the live broadcast and the West Coast taped airing, but also reappeared in the summer rerun, and even in the syndicated versions of the show for several years. Shaffer, at Letterman&#x27;s urging, related the story on the first episode of &quot;Late Night&quot;. 

Shaffer, along with executive producer Lorne Michaels, the entire cast, most of the writing staff, and several other band mates, left the show at the end of the season, after five years. Decades after leaving the show, Shaffer recounted that Jean Doumanian (who was taking over as producer the next season) offered him to be the new musical-director in light of Howard Shore leaving, but he turned it down. Citing in part that he didn&#x27;t wanna start the show again with a brand new cast, and he felt five years was enough time to do the show.

In February 2015, Shaffer appeared on the 40th-anniversary special of &quot;SNL&quot;, playing music to Bill Murray&#x27;s lounge-singer character, a love song from the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;.

===Collaboration with David Letterman===
Beginning in 1982, Shaffer served as musical director for David Letterman&#x27;s late night talk shows: as leader of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band&quot; for &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; (1982–1993) on NBC, for which he also composed the theme song, and as leader of the CBS Orchestra for the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (1993–2015) on CBS. Letterman consistently maintained that the show&#x27;s switch to CBS was because NBC &quot;caught Paul stealing pens&quot; or some other trivial reason. Shaffer guest-hosted the show four times when Letterman was unavailable: February 9 and 11, 2000, during Letterman&#x27;s recovery from his quintuple heart bypass surgery; March 24, 2003, when Letterman was suffering from shingles; and January 19, 2005, when Letterman went to receive an award for his racing team&#x27;s victory in the 2004 Indianapolis 500.

Shaffer wrote and performs the bridging music on Letterman&#x27;s Netflix series &quot;My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman&quot; which premiered in 2018. After Netflix announced publicly that it had given the series an order, Shaffer received a phone call from Letterman asking him to work on the show. Soon after, Shaffer began to receive cuts of episodes from the first season and he started to put music in afterwards where the director thought it was needed. In developing the sound of the show&#x27;s music, Shaffer initially looked to Letterman for guidance. Finding none, he remembered his and Letterman&#x27;s shared love for the sort of music produced at the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Alabama, describing it as &quot;the honesty you hear, the southern soul feeling&quot;. The score initially included drums, but the show&#x27;s producers and director thought that the music should &quot;feel like it&#x27;s Dave&#x27;s old friend Paul playing,&quot; so it was ultimately stripped down to solely include piano and organ.

===Musical collaboration===
Shaffer recorded the synthesizer solo in the 1982 song &quot;Goodbye to You&quot; by the band Scandal. He used his Oberheim OB-Xa to emulate a 1960s organ sound.

In 1984, Shaffer played keyboards for The Honeydrippers, a group formed in 1981 by former Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, on their only studio album, &quot;The Honeydrippers: Volume One&quot;. The album included the hit single &quot;Sea of Love&quot; which reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s adult contemporary chart in 1984 and number three on its Hot 100 chart in 1985.

He released two solo albums, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, and 1993&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Party&quot;, produced by rock musician Todd Rundgren. Shaffer has also recorded with a wide range of artists, including Donald Fagen, Ronnie Wood, Grand Funk Railroad, Diana Ross, B.B. King, Asleep at the Wheel, Cyndi Lauper, Carl Perkins, Yoko Ono, Blues Traveler, Jeff Healey, Cher, Barry Manilow, Chicago, Luba, Robert Burns, George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Nina Hagen, Robert Plant, Peter Criss, Scandal, Brian Wilson, &quot;Late Show&quot; regular Warren Zevon, jazz trumpeters Miles Davis and Lew Soloff, jazz saxophonist Lou Marini, and bluegrass legend Earl Scruggs. In 1982, he co-wrote &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; with Paul Jabara. It was number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play charts, a number-two hit in the UK for The Weather Girls in 1984, and a UK number-one remake for Geri Halliwell in 2001. Shaffer and the World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band performed the Chuck Berry song &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; for the 1992 film &quot;Beethoven&quot;.

Shaffer has served as musical director and producer for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony since its inception in 1986 and filled the same role for the 1996 Olympic Games closing ceremonies from Atlanta, Georgia. Shaffer also served as musical director for &quot;Fats Domino and Friends&quot;, a Cinemax special that included Ray Charles, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Ron Wood.

Shaffer has hosted Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum induction concert and ceremonies.

In 2017, Shaffer reunited with his band, resuming its previous name, and recorded the self-titled album &quot;Paul Shaffer and the World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Band&quot;. Shaffer and the band released their album in March and then went on tour, as well, as making appearances on both &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; and &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, for which Shaffer and the band returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater for the first time since Letterman&#x27;s finale two years earlier. In 2023, the band returned to 30 Rockefeller Plaza to act as the house band for one episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; while the regular band, The Roots, prepared for the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. They returned to the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; for a week in February 2025 when The Roots took a week off to rehearse for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&#x27;s 50th anniversary special.

===Movie and documentary appearances===

Each week, Shaffer signed off with, &quot;Just because you&#x27;re in a cover band, it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not a star.&quot; The show lasted 13 episodes and featured celebrity judges including Kevin Bacon, Nile Rodgers, Cyndi Lauper, and Ace Frehley.

Shaffer served as musical director for 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Concert for New York City&quot;, and accompanied Adam Sandler&#x27;s &quot;Opera Man&quot; sketch and the Backstreet Boys&#x27; &quot;Quit Playing Games (with My Heart)&quot;.
